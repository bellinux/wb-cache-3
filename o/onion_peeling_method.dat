While the night-time data of GOMOS are proved to be of good quality, the daytime observations are more challenging due to poorer signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper we present an alternative technique, which uses GOMOS limb scattered radiances instead of the stellar signal, to retrieve stratospheric ozone profiles. Like for many other limb-viewing instruments, GOMOS observations contain stray light at high altitudes.

The GOMOS (Global Ozone Monitoring by Oc-cultation of Stars) {{instrument}} {{on board}} the Envisat satellite measures the vertical composition of the atmosphere using the stellar occultation technique. While the night-time oc-cultations of GOMOS have been proven to be of good qual-ity, the daytime occultations are more challenging due to weaker signal-to-noise ratio. During daytime GOMOS mea-sures limb scattered solar radiation in addition to stellar ra-diation. In this paper we introduce a retrieval method that determines ozone profiles between 20 – 60 km from GOMOS limb scattered solar radiances.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{presents}} the experimental validation {{of a new}} deconvolution technique that calculates local drop size distributions from line-of-sight laser diffraction measurements. Previous deconvolution techniques {{are based on the}} <b>onion</b> <b>peeling</b> <b>method</b> but errors cumulate at each inward step of the calculation and the calculation always reports unrealistic local negative information. These problems are avoided by using a different calculation method based on a maximum entropy formulation that determines the least biased solution at each local position. The experimental validation is implemented by Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA). The sprays studied for the validation are sprays of water produced by a solid-cone pressure-swirl injector. These sprays are assumed axisymmetric. Laser diffraction measurements are carried out with a Malvern-Spraytec at several radial positions ranging from the center to the outskirts of the spray for several working conditions. Local drop size measurements are conducted with the PDPA. These two diagnostics report totally different information. Comparisons between laser diffraction and PDPA data are performed on both radially resolved and line-of-sight bases. Comparisons on the line-of-sight basis are firstly performed to indicate that both diagnostics measure the same ensemble of drops and if the local distributions from both diagnostics do not agree, it is due to deconvolution method. The new deconvolution technique is consequently validated by comparisons on the radially resolved basis. The results show a very good agreement in each working condition...|$|E

Stratospheric methane (CH 4) {{profiles}} {{have been}} derived from solar occultation {{measurements of the}} SCan-ning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) on ENVISAT with an up-dated version of the <b>Onion</b> <b>Peeling</b> DOAS (ONPD) <b>method.</b> The SCIAMACHY solar occultation measurements cover the latitudinal range between about 50 ◦ N and 70 ◦ N. Currently, reasonable results are obtained between 20 and 40 km alti-tude. Comparisons with correlative ACE-FTS measurements show an average agreement within the expected accuracy of the ACE-FTS data of about 10 %. To demonstrate the ca-pability of SCIAMACHY solar occultation measurements {{in the context of}} greenhouse gas monitoring, time series of stratospheric CH 4 profiles covering the period from 2003 to 2010 have been generated. The SCIAMACHY CH 4 profile solar occultation temporal series shows a strong seasonal cy-cle. This is attributed to the variations in both time and space of the retrieved data set. At lower altitudes, the observed tem-poral variations are explained by variations of the tropopause height. The temporal data set is also impacted by variations of the size and duration of the polar vortex in the northern hemisphere. The data set provides unique information about CH 4 changes in the stratosphere at mid to high latitudes. ...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the first}} of two papers {{investigating}} the deprojection and spherical averaging of ellipsoidal galaxy clusters. We specifically consider applications to hydrostatic X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) studies, though many of the results also apply to isotropic dispersion-supported stellar dynamical systems. Here we present analytical formulas for galaxy clusters described by a gravitational potential that is a triaxial ellipsoid of constant shape and orientation. For this model type we show that the mass bias due to spherically averaging X-ray observations is independent of the temperature profile, and for the special case of a scale-free logarithmic potential, there is exactly zero mass bias for any shape, orientation, and temperature profile. The ratio of spherically averaged intracluster medium (ICM) pressures obtained from SZ and X-ray measurements depends only on the ICM intrinsic shape, projection orientation, and H_ 0, which provides another illustration of how cluster geometry can be recovered through a combination of X-ray and SZ measurements. We also demonstrate that Y_SZ and Y_X have different biases owing to spherical averaging, which leads to an offset in the spherically averaged Y_SZ - Y_X relation. A potentially useful application of the analytical formulas presented is to assess the error range of an observable (e. g., mass, Y_SZ) accounting for deviations from assumed spherical symmetry, without having to perform the ellipsoidal deprojection explicitly. Finally, for dedicated ellipsoidal studies, we also generalize the spherical <b>onion</b> <b>peeling</b> <b>method</b> to the triaxial case for a given shape and orientation.

40|$|Many non-intrusive {{combustion}} diagnosis methods generate line-of-sight {{projections of}} a flame field. To reconstruct the spatial {{field of the}} measured properties, these projections need to be deconvoluted. When the spatial field is axisymmetric, commonly used deconvolution method include the Abel transforms, the <b>onion</b> <b>peeling</b> <b>method</b> and the two-dimensional Fourier transform method and its derivatives such as the filtered back projection methods. This paper proposes a new approach for performing the Abel transform method is developed, which possesses the exactness of the Abel transform and the flexibility of incorporating various filters in the reconstruction process. The Abel transform is an exact method and the simplest among these commonly used methods. It is evinced in this paper that all the exact reconstruction methods for axisymmetric distributions must be equivalent to the Abel transform because of its uniqueness and exactness. Detailed proof is presented {{to show that the}} two dimensional Fourier methods when applied to axisymmetric cases is identical to the Abel transform. Discrepancies among various reconstruction method stem from the different approximations made to perform numerical calculations. An equation relating the spectrum of a set of projection date to that of the corresponding spatial distribution is obtained, which shows that the spectrum of the projection is equal to the Abel transform of the spectrum of the corresponding spatial distribution. From the equation, if either the projection or the distribution is bandwidth limited, the other is also bandwidth limited, and both have the same bandwidth. If the two are not bandwidth limited, the Abel transform has a bias against low wave number components in most practical cases. This explains why the Abel transform and all exact deconvolution methods are sensitive to high wave number noises. The filtered Abel transform is {{based on the fact that}} the Abel transform of filtered projection data is equal to an integral transform of the original projection data with the kernel function being the Abel transform of the filtering function. The kernel function is independent of the projection data and can be obtained separately when the filtering function is selected. Users can select the best filtering function for a particular set of experimental data. When the kernal function is obtained, it can be used repeatedly to a number of projection data sets (rovs) from the same experiment. When an entire flame image that contains a large number of projection lines needs to be processed, the new approach significantly reduces computational effort in comparison with the conventional approach in which each projection data set is deconvoluted separately. Computer codes have been developed to perform the filter Abel transform for an entire flame field. Measured soot volume fraction data of a jet diffusion flame are processed as an example...|$|E

40|$|Measurements of the Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{are crucial}} {{for understanding the}} behavior of the atmosphere and the underlying chemical and dynamical processes. Adequate monitoring of stratospheric ozone and greenhouse gases, for example, requires continuous global observations. Although expensive to build and complicated to operate, satellite instruments provide the best means for the global monitoring. Satellite data are often supplemented by ground-based measurements, which have limited coverage but typically provide more accurate data. Many atmospheric processes are altitude-dependent. Hence, the most useful atmospheric measurements provide information about the vertical distribution of the trace gases. Satellite instruments that observe Earth's limb are especially suitable for measuring atmospheric profiles. Satellite instruments looking down from the orbit, and remote sensing instruments looking up from the ground, generally provide considerably less information about the vertical distribution. Remote sensing measurements are indirect. The instruments observe electromagnetic radiation, but it is ozone, for example, that we are interested in. Interpreting the measured data requires a forward model that contains physical laws governing the measurement. Furthermore, to infer meaningful information from the data, we have to solve the corresponding inverse problem. Atmospheric inverse problems are typically nonlinear and ill-posed, requiring numerical treatment and prior assumptions. In this work, we developed inversion methods for the retrieval of atmospheric profiles. We used measurements by Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imager System (OSIRIS) on board the Odin satellite, Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars (GOMOS) on board the Envisat satellite, and ground-based Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) at Sodankylä, Finland. For OSIRIS and GOMOS, we developed an <b>onion</b> <b>peeling</b> inversion <b>method</b> and retrieved ozone, aerosol, and neutral air profiles. From the OSIRIS data, we also retrieved NO 2 profiles. For the FTS data, we developed a dimension reduction inversion method and used Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) statistical estimation to retrieve methane profiles. Main contributions of this work are the retrieved OSIRIS and GOMOS satellite data sets, and the novel retrieval method applied to the FTS data. Long satellite data records are useful for trends studies and for distinguishing between anthropogenic effects and natural variations. Before this work, GOMOS daytime ozone profiles were missing from scientific studies because the operational GOMOS daytime occultation product contains large biases. The GOMOS bright limb ozone product vastly improves the stratospheric part of the GOMOS daytime ozone. On the other hand, the dimension reduction method is a promising new technique for the retrieval of atmospheric profiles, especially when the measurement contains little information about the vertical distribution of gases...|$|R

The IC 50 value for superoxide dismutase (SOD) -like activity was in the range of 11, 900. 91 ~ 12, 690. 35 ppm. A clear zone of OPE (20, 000 ppm) in fibrinolysis test was three times higher than the plasmin as a reference. In conclusion, OPE could be used as a good source of antioxidants and fibrinolyti...|$|R

Iz neizkoriščenih čebulnih olupkov smo želeli pridobiti kvercetin, kot produkt z visoko dodano vrednostjo. S pomočjo konvencionalne ekstrakcije čebulnih olupkov smo pridobili čebulni ekstrakt, le-temu smo določili vsebnost totalnih fenolov v ekstraktu s Folin-Ciocalteu metodo. Ekstrakt smo hidrolizirali po postopku kislinske hidrolize s HCl in s tem določili vsebnost totalnega kvercetina v ekstraktu. Preučevali smo vpliv parametrov (temperatura, tlak in uporabljena vrsta plina v avtoklavu, kontaktni čas in koncentracija raztopine ekstrakta) na izkoristek hidrolize s subkritično vodo v šaržnem reaktorju. Na podlagi optimalnih pogojev v šaržnem reaktorju smo izvedli kontinuirno hidrolizo ekstrakta s subkritično vodo. Kvalitativno in kvantitativno vsebnost kvercetina v hidroliziranih vzorcih smo določili s HPLC analizo. Rezultati kažejo, da smo najvišji izkoristek ekstrakcije dosegli pri ekstrakciji zmlete mešanice olupka in jedilnega dela čebule z vodo pri temperaturi 95 °C. Najvišjo vsebnost totalnih fenolov smo določili v ekstraktu čebulnega olupka, pridobljenega s 35 % raztopino etanola pri 80 °C. Najvišji odstotek hidrolize smo s šaržnim procesom dosegli pri 195 °C, kontaktnem času 12, 5 min, uporabi CO 2 pri tlaku 215 bar in koncentraciji raztopine ekstrakta 0, 1 mg/ml. Na podlagi rezultatov HPLC meritev sklepamo, da pri šaržnem procesu, z naraščajočo koncentracijo vodne raztopine čebulnega ekstrakta odstotek hidrolize pada. Najvišji odstotek hidrolize pri kontinuirnem procesu smo dosegli pri temperaturi 200 °C, tlaku 102 bar, kontaktnem času 12, 9 min in koncentraciji raztopine ekstrakta 0, 5 mg/ml. HPLC analiza je pokazala, da kot stranska produkta med potekom hidrolizne reakcije poleg ostalih komponent nastajata 3, 4 -dihidroksi benzojska kislina in 5 -hidroksi metil furfural, ki ga lahko zaradi razlik v topnosti v vodi separiramo od kvercetina. Abstract This master thesis {{describes}} the possible usage of subcritical water as hydrolysis medium for selective decomposition of glycoside bounded antioxidants in red <b>onion</b> <b>peel</b> extract. The main {{intention was to}} obtain quercetin from unused red <b>onion</b> <b>peels</b> as a material with added value. Convencional extraction of <b>onion</b> <b>peels</b> enabled us to obtain the <b>onion</b> <b>peel</b> extract. The content of total phenols in the extract was determinated with the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. The extract was hydrolyzed according to the procedure of acid hydrolysis with HCl and {{the total amount of}} quercetin in the extract was determined. We studied the effect of reaction parameters (temperature, pressure and type of gas in autoclave, contact time and concentration of extract solution) on efficiency of hydrolysis with subcritical water in batch reactor. Using optimal conditions in the batch reactor, continuous hydrolysis of extract with subcritical water was performed. Qualitative and quantitative content of quercetin in hydrolysed samples was determined with HPLC analysis. Results show that the highest amount of extract was acquired when the grinded mixture of peels and eadible part of onion was extracted by water at a temperature of 95 °C. The highest content of total phenols was determined in extract of <b>onion</b> <b>peels</b> that was obtained with a 35 % ethanol solution at 80 °C. The highest percentage of hydrolysis performed in batch process was achieved at 195 °C, at a contact time of 12. 5 minutes, using CO 2 at a pressure of 215 bar and a concentration of extract solution of 0. 1 mg/ml. Based on results of HPLC measurements we can conclude that the percentage of hydrolysis in batch process is decreasing by increasing concentration of water solution of onion extract. The highest percentage of hydrolysis performed in continuous mode was achieved at a temperature of 200 °C, pressure of 102 bar, treatment time of 12. 5 min and 0. 5 mg/ml concentration of extract solution. HPLC analysis indicated that during the hydrolysis reaction, 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural and 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid are produced as side products, however 5 -HMF could be separated from quercetin, due to differences in solubility in water...|$|R

The users are assigned signature waveforms, their signaling is synchronous, {{and hence the}} equivalent discrete-time model is a general Gaussian multiple-access channel #GMAC#. A new class of receivers is proposed. The receivers within this class feature low-complexity detectors and allow the users to choose single-user codes independently of each other.
