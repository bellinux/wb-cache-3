40|$|For someone {{familiar}} {{with the notion of}} self-parallel group for an immersion into euclidean space [3], [6] it is only natural to wonder what happens if, in the case of space curves, normal planes are replaced by, say, <b>osculating</b> <b>planes.</b> We give here a necessary and sufficient condition for the non-triviality of the osculating group of a simple space curve. This is, in the new situation, the group corresponding to the self-parallel group. Problems of a similar nature have also been considered in [1] and [2]. 1. In what follows X will stand for R or S 1 and we will be dealing with smooth space curves, that is, C ∞ immersions f: X → R 3. In the caseX = S 1, we will write f for both f: S 1 → R 3 and f ◦ exp, with exp (t) = (cos 2 pit, sin 2 pit). It will be clear from the context which one we are considering. The curvature kf of f is assumed not to vanish and (Tf, Nf, Bf) will denote the Frenet-Serret frame. Also we do not assume parametrization by arc-length and denote by vf the velocity of f.

40|$|In this work, we give {{parallel}} {{transport frame}} of a curve and we introduce {{the relations between}} the frame and Frenet frame of the curve in 4 -dimensional Euclidean space. The relation which is well known in Euclidean 3 -space is generalized {{for the first time in}} 4 -dimensional Euclidean space. Then we obtain the condition for spherical curves using the parallel transport frame of them. The condition in terms of κ and τ is so complicated but in terms of k_ 1 and k_ 2 is simple. So, parallel transport frame is important to make easy some complicated characterizations. Moreover, we characterize curves whose position vectors lie in their normal, rectifying and <b>osculating</b> <b>planes</b> in 4 -dimensional Euclidean space E^ 4. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|This work re-examines some {{classical}} {{results in}} the kinematics of points in space using modern vector-matrix methods. In particular, some very simple Lie theory allows the velocities and accelerations of points {{to be found in}} terms of the instantaneous twist of the motion and its derivative. From these results many of the classical results follow rather simply. Although most of the results are well known, some new material is presented. In particular, the discriminant curve that separates cases with one or three real acceleration axes is found and plotted. Another new result concerns the chords to the cubic of inflexion points. It is shown that for points on such a chord the <b>osculating</b> <b>planes</b> of the point's trajectories are parallel. Also a new result is found which distinguishes between cases where the Bresse hyperboloid of points whose velocities and accelerations are perpendicular, has one or two sheets. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The conformations and {{dynamics}} of semiflexible filaments {{subject to a}} homogeneous external (gravitational) field, e. g., in a centrifuge, are studied numerically and analytically. The competition between hydrodynamic drag and bending elasticity generates new shapes and dynamical features. We show that {{the shape of a}} semiflexible filament undergoes instabilities as the external field increases. We identify two transitions that correspond to the excitation of higher bending modes. In particular, for strong fields the filament stabilizes in a non-planar shape, resulting in a sideways drift or in helical trajectories. For two interacting filaments, we find the same transitions, with the important consequence that the new non-planar shapes have an effective hydrodynamic repulsion, in contrast to the planar shapes which attract themselves even when their <b>osculating</b> <b>planes</b> are rotated with respect to each other. For the case of planar filaments, we show analytically and numerically that the relative velocity is not necessarily due to a different drag of the individual filaments, but to the hydrodynamic interactions induced by their shape asymmetry.

40|$|An {{orthonormal}} frame (f 1, f 2, f 3) is rotation-minimizing {{with respect}} to fi if its angular velocity ω satisfies ω× fi ≡ 0 - or, equivalently, the derivatives of fj and fk are both parallel to fi. The Frenet frame (t,p,b) along a space curve is rotation-minimizing {{with respect to}} the principal normal p, and in recent years adapted frames that are rotation-minimizing {{with respect to the}} tangent t have attracted much interest. This study is concerned with rotation-minimizing osculating frames (f,g,b) incorporating the binormal b, and osculating-plane vectors f, g that have no rotation about b. These frame vectors may be defined through a rotation of t, p by an angle equal to minus the integral of curvature with respect to arc length. In aeronautical terms, the rotation-minimizing osculating frame (RMOF) specifies yaw-free rigid-body motion along a curved path. For polynomial space curves possessing rational Frenet frames, the existence of rational RMOFs is investigated, and it is found that they must be of degree 7 at least. The RMOF is also employed to construct a novel type of ruled surface, with the property that its tangent planes coincide with the <b>osculating</b> <b>planes</b> of a given space curve, and its rulings exhibit the least possible rate of rotation consistent with this constraint. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{projected}} {{deformation of}} stationary contours and markings on object surfaces is analyzed in this paper.

40|$|In this research, the {{geometrical}} {{structures of}} tilted current sheet and tail flapping waves have been analysed based on multiple spacecraft measurements and some {{features of the}} tilted current sheets have been made clear for the first time. The geometrical features of the tilted current sheet revealed in this investigation are as follows: (1) The magnetic field lines (MFLs) in the tilted current sheet are generally plane curves and the <b>osculating</b> <b>planes</b> in which the MFLs lie are about vertical to the equatorial plane, while the normal of the tilted current sheet leans severely to the dawn or dusk side. (2) The tilted current sheet may become very thin, the half thickness of its neutral sheet is generally {{much less than the}} minimum radius of the curvature of the MFLs. (3) In the neutral sheet, the field-aligned current density becomes very large and has a maximum value {{at the center of the}} current sheet. (4) In some cases, the current density is a bifurcated one, and the two humps of the current density often superpose two peaks in the gradient of magnetic strength, indicating that the magnetic gradient drift current is possibly responsible for the formation of the two humps of the current density in some tilted current sheets. Tilted current sheets often appear along with tail current sheet flapping waves. It is found that, in the tail flapping current sheets, the minimum curvature radius of the MFLs in the current sheet is rather large with values around 1 RE, while the neutral sheet may be very thin, with its half thickness being several tenths of RE. During the flapping waves, the current sheet is tilted substantially, and the maximum tilt angle is generally larger than 45 &deg;. The phase velocities of these flapping waves are several tens km/s, while their periods and wavelengths are several tens of minutes, and several earth radii, respectively. These tail flapping events generally last several hours and occur during quiet periods or periods of weak magnetospheric activity...|$|R
50|$|A Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO, {{also called}} a heliosynchronous orbit) is a near polar orbit around Earth (also called geocentric orbit) {{in which the}} {{satellite}} passes over any given point of the planet's surface at the same local solar time. Such an orbit can place a satellite in constant sunlight and is useful for imaging, spy, and weather satellites. More technically, it is an orbit arranged {{in such a way}} that it precesses once a year. The surface illumination angle will be nearly the same every time that the satellite is overhead. This consistent lighting is a useful characteristic for satellites that image the Earth's surface in visible or infrared wavelengths (e.g. weather and spy satellites) and for other remote sensing satellites (e.g. those carrying ocean and atmospheric remote sensing instruments that require sunlight). For example, a satellite in sun-synchronous orbit might ascend across the equator twelve times a day each time at approximately 15:00 mean local time. This is achieved by having the <b>osculating</b> orbital <b>plane</b> precess (rotate) approximately one degree each day with respect to the celestial sphere, eastward, to keep pace with the Earth's movement around the Sun.|$|R
