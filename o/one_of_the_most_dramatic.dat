5|$|Habitat {{modification}} or {{destruction is}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> issues affecting amphibian species worldwide. As amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive, threats to either habitat can affect populations. Hence, amphibians {{may be more}} vulnerable to habitat modification than organisms that only require one habitat type. Large scale climate changes may further be modifying aquatic habitats, preventing amphibians from spawning altogether.|$|E
5|$|On December 10, 2016, the Sounders {{defeated}} Toronto FC 5–4 in {{a penalty}} shootout, to win MLS Cup 2016, their first MLS championship in franchise history, without even registering {{a single shot}} on goal. With the Sounder's slow season start and midseason turmoil, the team's turnaround from bottom of the league to eventual champions is considered <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> comebacks in MLS history.|$|E

5|$|The {{match is}} {{considered}} to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> conclusions to a league season {{in the history of the}} English game. It is also regarded as the starting point of a renaissance in English football; the ban on English clubs playing in European football was lifted a year later and a new top-flight division – the Premier League, was formed in 1992 which generated more revenue for clubs. The title decider also formed the centrepiece of Nick Hornby's book Fever Pitch.|$|E
5|$|The K–Pg {{boundary}} represents <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> turnovers in {{the fossil}} record for various calcareous nanoplankton that formed the calcium deposits that gave the Cretaceous its name. The turnover in this group is clearly marked at the species level. Statistical analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by {{a sharp increase in}} extinctions, than by a decrease in speciation. The K–Pg boundary record of dinoflagellates is not so well understood, mainly because only microbial cysts provide a fossil record, and not all dinoflagellate species have cyst-forming stages, thereby, likely causing diversity to be underestimated. Recent studies indicate that there were no major shifts in dinoflagellates through the boundary layer.|$|E
25|$|Brazil has {{witnessed}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> reductions in family size {{in modern history}} {{in part due to}} increased access to family planning services.

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> {{effects of}} the war was the {{expansion}} of governmental powers and responsibilities in Britain, France, the United States, and the Dominions of the British Empire. To harness all the power of their societies, governments created new ministries and powers. New taxes were levied and laws enacted, all designed to bolster the war effort; many have lasted to this day. Similarly, the war strained the abilities of some formerly large and bureaucratised governments, such as in Austria-Hungary and Germany.|$|E
25|$|Barcelona also {{reached the}} 1986 European Cup Final, {{although}} {{they lost to}} Steaua București in a penalty shoot-out following a 0–0 draw.

25|$|The Western Federation of Miners (WFM) was {{a radical}} labor union that gained a {{reputation}} for militancy in the mines of the western United States and British Columbia. Its efforts to organize both hard rock miners and smelter workers brought it into sharp conflicts – and often pitched battles – with both employers and governmental authorities. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> of these struggles occurred in the Cripple Creek district in 1903–04, and {{has been called the}} Colorado Labor Wars.

25|$|Florida posted another 9–1–1 {{record in}} 1985, Hall's first full season as head coach, and was briefly ranked {{number one in}} the AP Poll {{for the first time in}} school history. The Gators {{finished}} the season atop the SEC standings, but were ineligible for the conference title. Although he never had a losing season, Hall's subsequent teams did not match his early success when the scholarship losses for Pell's violations took their full effect; his first two recruiting classes had only 25 players. The unranked 1986 Gators upset the Auburn Tigers, 18–17. Kerwin Bell led the Gators to overcome a 17–0 fourth-quarter deficit in a game still considered <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> in Florida Field history.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the nineteenth century, the game of {{baseball}} began to evolve from a sport played by amateurs for recreation into a more serious game played by professionals. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> changes was the transition of the pitcher's delivery from an underhand motion to an overhanded throw. Before the American Civil War, the pitcher's role was to initiate the action by offering an underhanded throw to the batter, in much the same way that a basketball referee offers up a jump ball to begin play. Since this type of pitching often caused the batter to hit lazy, foul pop-ups, catchers played their position approximately twenty to twenty-five feet behind the batter, and wore no protective equipment.|$|E

25|$|On 23 July, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> single {{events in}} the {{conflict}} occurred when another police border patrol was attacked in an NLA ambush near Raduša. The police patrol was led by Aco Stojanovski, the Deputy-Commander of the Raduša police station. The insurgents fired at the police vehicle with RPG rockets, throwing three policemen {{out of the car}} and leaving one inside. The NLA attempted to approach the badly wounded policemen. Commander Stojanovski's firing six rounds from an AK-47 at the insurgents saved them until soldiers from the Raduša border post arrived and repelled the NLA with fire from an armored personnel carrier. After the conflict, commander Stojanovski became the president of the Union of Army and Police veterans of the Conflict in Macedonia.|$|E
25|$|There was no scoring {{until the}} 14th inning when the Mets {{would take the}} lead on a Wally Backman single and an error by left fielder Billy Hatcher. The Astros would get the run back {{in the bottom of}} the 14th when Hatcher (in a classic goat-to-hero-conversion-moment) hit <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> home runs in NLCS history, off the left field foul pole. In the 16th inning, Darryl Strawberry doubled to lead off the inning and Ray Knight drove him home in the next at-bat. The Mets would score a total of three runs in the inning to take what {{appeared}} an insurmountable 74 lead. With their season on the line, the Astros would nonetheless rally for two runs to come to within 76. Kevin Bass came up with the tying and winning runs on base; however Jesse Orosco would strike him out, ending the game.|$|E
25|$|The next year, Durant {{started the}} Chevrolet Motor Car Company in the U.S., and in Canada in 1915, and through this, he {{secretly}} purchased a controlling interest in GM. Durant took back {{control of the}} company after <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> proxy wars in American business history. Durant then reorganized General Motors Company into General Motors Corporation in 1916, merging Chevrolet with GM and merging General Motors of Canada Limited as an ally in 1918. Shortly thereafter, he again lost control, this time for good, after the new vehicle market collapsed. Alfred P. Sloan was picked to take charge of the corporation, and led it to its post-war global dominance when the seven manufacturing facilities operated by Chevrolet before GM acquired the company began to contribute to GM operations. These facilities were added to the individual factories that were exclusive to Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Oakland, and other companies acquired by GM. This unprecedented growth of GM would last into the early 1980s, when it employed 349,000 workers and operated 150 assembly plants.|$|E

25|$|The post lunch {{session was}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> {{sessions}} in Test history. VVS Laxman played {{one of his}} best knocks along with Ishant Sharma for most of the post lunch session. He was happy to give Ishant most of the strike with Ishant stone-walling the rest of the over. Occasional boundaries (mainly from Sharma) and early singles off every over had India slowly, but surely inching towards their target. In what seemed like forever, India crawled from 124/8 to 170, 180 and 190/8. Finally Ishant got out to a Ben Hilfenhaus lbw decision that replays showed was going down the leg side, with the score at 205. Pragyan Ojha, the last man for India joined Laxman at the crease. During Mitchell Johnson's over more drama followed with Ojha being clearly struck in line, but On-field Umpire Billy Bowden turned down the appeal. Pragyan Ojha tried to sneak a single when substitute fielder Steven Smith shied at the stumps. But unfortunately for Australia, no fielders where backing his throw. It went for four overthrows meaning India just needed 2 runs to win.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 1965 season, Hailwood left to join Honda as he had {{tired of}} working for the {{difficult}} Count Agusta. With Agostini now the top MV Agusta rider, he responded by winning the 500cc title seven years in succession for the Italian factory. He would also win the 350cc title seven times in succession and won 10 Isle of Man TTs. At the time, the Isle of Man TT and the Ulster Grand Prixs were regularly won by Anglophonic (mostly British) riders; in addition to Agostini's successes at the TT he also won 7 Ulster Grand Prix races- he was the only non-British rider to achieve the same kind of success in these British motorcycle races- which were 2 of the most difficult motorcycle races in the world at the time. In 1967 he battled Hailwood in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> seasons in Grand Prix history. Each rider had 5 victories before the championship was decided in Agostini's favor at the last race of the season.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1976–77 season, the clubs {{finishing}} level on points {{began to be}} separated according to goal difference (the difference between goals scored and goals conceded) rather than goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded). This {{was an effort to}} prevent unduly defensive play encouraged by the greater advantage in limiting goals allowed. In the event that clubs had equal points and equal goal differences, priority was given to the club that had scored the most goals. There has been only one season, 1988–89, when this level of differentiation was necessary to determine the League champion, and this was the occasion of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dramatic</b> nights in League history, when Arsenal beat Liverpool 2–0 at Anfield in the last game of the season to win the League on this tiebreaker – by a single Michael Thomas goal in the final minute of the final game of the season. Both teams would finish with the same amount the goal difference, but Arsenal scored more goals during the season. In the Premier League era, the 2011–12 season also had the winner being determined by a tiebreaker; Manchester City finished with a better goal difference than Manchester United.|$|E
