The <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticide</b> residues recorded in water samples from the various sites (within the various distance categories to cocoa farms) were below their respective WHO MRLs for drinking water except for alpha-endosulfan at Diabaa (S 2) and Kwakuanya (S 4) at distance 0 – 15  m and at Kwakuanya (S 4) at distance 16 – 30  m, endosulfan-sulfate at Nkrankwanta (S 1) and Diabaa (S 2) at distance 0 – 15  m and heptachlor at Krakrom (S 3) at distance 16 – 30  m. The presence of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticide</b> residues in the water samples {{could be due to}} drift during pesticide application, direct overspray, direct spillage, pesticides misuse, improper disposal of left over spray solution, sprayer wash water and pesticide containers, runoff from treated areas or leaching, among others. The concentrations measured however suggest that pesticide residues in hand-dug wells within the various distances do not pose health threats to cocoa farmers’ households except for wells from S 1, S 2, and S 4 at distances 0 – 15  m and S 3 and S 4 at distances 16 – 30  m which recorded concentrations of some residues above their respective WHO MRL for drinking water.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} serum <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticide</b> residues and risk of gallstone disease. Methods: A 1 : 1, pair-matched, case-control study was designed. Data from 150 patients with gallstones diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonography at a single hospital from June 2009 to June 2010 were collected. A total of 150 patients without gallstones {{during the same period}} at the same hospital were recruited as the control group. Capillary gas chromatography was employed to measure the serum concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) residues. Multiple-factor conditional logistic regression analysis was conducted to estimate the relative risk of gallstones in relation to <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticide</b> residues in serum. Results: The percentages of p,p'-DDD and o,p'-DDT in serum of patients were significantly higher than those in serum of controls. The p,p'-DDE, alpha-HCH, and delta-HCH residues in serum of patients were also significantly increased compared with those in serum of controls. Multiple-factor conditional logistic regression analysis showed that high levels of p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT residues were risk factors for gallstone disease. Conclusions: A high level of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticide</b> residues in serum is a potential risk factor for gallstone disease, which suggests that environmental exposure to organochlorine pesticides should be evaluated with respect to gallstone formation.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{hypothesis}} that <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticide</b> use in the 1950 s and 1960 s caused population declines and local extinctions in two endemic Mauritian birds, the Mauritius kestrel, Falco punctatus, and Mauritius cuckoo-shrike, Coracina typica. This hypothesis was suggested in the 1980 s but is dismissed by authorities in Mauritius. The declines and subsequent increases in the populations and range areas of both species, the timing and location {{of the use of}} organochlorines for malaria control and in food crop production, the diets of the species, and the known mechanisms for transfer of organochlorine residues into organisms are all consistent with the hypothesis. No alternative explanation can at present account for these population changes. <b>Organochlorine</b> <b>pesticide</b> use cannot therefore be rejected as a reason for the declines and local extinctions of the kestrel and cuckoo-shrike...|$|E
40|$|Studies on {{distribution}} of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> in water column and sediments from Banten Bay were conducted during transitional season on April and October, 2001. The {{objectives of the}} study were to determine the concentration and {{distribution of}} total <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> in water column and sediments in transitional seasons, and to identify its sources. Our study showed the concentration of <b>pesticides</b> <b>organochlorine</b> in water column ranged between 0. 366 and 4. 391 ng/l with an average of 1. 952 ng/l in April (location 1), and 0. 357 and 2. 998 ng/l with an average of 1. 203 ng/l in October (location 2). And then pesticide concentration in sediment were ranged between 0. 263 and 2. 090 µg/l dry weight (dw) with an average of 1. 281 µg/l in June (location 1), and 0. 068 to 10. 095 µg/l dw with an average of 1. 775 µg/l in October (location 2). The result indicated different influence of the season on <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> concentration and there was fresh input of DDT in the study area...|$|R
40|$|The only marine science related chapter: Chapter 8 {{contains}} two {{applications of the}} determination of POPs in aquatic biota. Farmed and wild Scottish Atlantic salmon, aquaculture feeds and fish oils, obtained in January 1999, were investigated for the determination {{of a wide range}} of PCBs, <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> and PBDEs. The study confirms previous reports of relatively high concentrations of PCBs, and indicates moderate concentrations of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> and PBDEs in farmld salmon. For the Scottish salmon samples, the PCB TEQ was twice that of PCDD/Fs. The results indicate that high consumption of salmon, particularly by children under 5 years, could lead to intakes above the tolerable daily intake (TDI) and tolerable weekly intake (TWI) for these chemicals, especially PCBs, in combination with mean or high level intakes from the UK diet. Liver samples from 21 harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) stranded on the Belgian North Sea coast were analysed for a wide range of PCBs, <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> and PBDEs. PCBs were the most important organochlorine contaminants in the harbour porpoises, while the most abundant <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> were DDT and its metabolites, followed by HCB and HCHs. The mean concentrations of groups of pollutants were, with some exceptions, similar with those reported in the literature. Differences between levels and profiles of POPs were observed between adults and juveniles, as well as between males and females...|$|R
40|$|Tonghui River, {{a typical}} river in Beijing, People's Republic of China, was studied for its water and {{sediment}} quality, by determining the levels of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 12 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 18 <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> in {{water and sediment}} samples. Total PAHs, PCBs and <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> concentrations in water varied from 192. 5 to 2651 ng/l, 31. 58 - 344. 9 ng/l and 134. 9 - 3788 ng/l, respectively. The total PAHs, PCBs and <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> concentrations in surficial sediments were 127 - 928 ng/g, 0. 78 - 8. 47 ng/g and 1. 79 - 13. 98 ng/g dry weight, respectively. The {{results showed that the}} concentration of these selected organic pollutants in sediment was higher than those in surface water. It {{may be due to the}} fact that organic hydrophobic pollutants tend to stay in the sediments. The PAHs were dominated by 2 -, 3 -ring components in water samples and by 3 - and 4 -ring compounds in sediment. For organochlorines, alpha-HCH, delta-HCH, Heptachlor, Endosulfan 11, DDT are the major <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> in water while Heptachlor, Dieldrin and DDE composed of 95 % of total <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> in sediment. For HCHs (HCHs = alpha-HCH + beta-HCH + gamma-HCH + delta-HCH), the predominance of alpha-HCH of total HCHs were clearly observed in water and sediment. PCB 18, PCB 31 and PCB 52 were predominant in water, on average these compounds collectively accounted for 67 % of total PCBs. But in sediment, the predominant compounds were PCB 28, PCB 31 and PCB 153, which accounted for 71 % of total PCBs in sediment. The levels of micro pollutants in our study areas were compared with other studies. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
