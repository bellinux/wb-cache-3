5|$|A Test {{match is}} won when one side has scored more runs {{than the total}} runs scored by the {{opposing}} side during their two innings. If both sides have completed both their allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher aggregate <b>of</b> <b>runs,</b> it {{is known as a}} win by runs. This indicates the number <b>of</b> <b>runs</b> that they had scored more than the opposing side. If one side scores more runs in a single innings than the total runs scored by the other side in both their innings, it is known as a win by innings and runs. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.|$|E

5|$|An illness {{during the}} winter of 1913–14 took its toll on Kilner {{at the start of the}} 1914 season. He passed 1,000 runs for the second time but due to his {{uncertain}} form, his aggregate <b>of</b> <b>runs</b> and his average both fell. He scored 1,329 runs (average 30.90), placing him fourth in the Yorkshire batting averages. His bowling was rarely used and he took just one wicket. Kilner scored his second first-class century against Gloucestershire late in the season; he made 169 in nearly three and a half hours, hitting 28 fours. Yorkshire fell to fourth in the championship.|$|E
5|$|Brown partnered the {{recovered}} Barnes and patiently scored 140, {{before being}} the fifth man {{out with the}} score at 344, as Australia amassed 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings immediately after the Fourth Test. Looking to regain his Test position by sheer weight <b>of</b> <b>runs,</b> Brown started slowly; Barnes made 24 of the first 29 runs. He took 185 minutes to reach 50, much to the displeasure of the restless spectators, before accelerating and scoring his next 50 runs in 37 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Grace was {{seventh in}} the overall {{national}} batting averages and third among those batsmen who completed 10 innings. The two above him were John Selby (31.26) and Edward Lyttelton (29.96). In terms <b>of</b> <b>runs</b> scored, Grace {{was one of only}} two players to complete 1,000. The other was George Ulyett who made 1,270 at an average of 27.02. Due to generally damp conditions, 1878 was not a good season for batsmen with only 14 centuries being scored; only one player, A. J. Webbe, scored two.|$|E
5|$|In the {{overtime}} period, Alabama was {{on offense}} first. McCarron opened their drive {{with a pair}} of incompletions to Richardson. After a five-yard substitution penalty and a five-yard quarterback sack by Sam Montgomery, Foster missed a 52-yard field goal. On LSU's possession, Ware had a three-yard rush and then Ford had a 15-yard run to give the Tigers a first down from the Alabama seven. After a pair <b>of</b> <b>runs</b> that netted a loss of one yard, on third down, Alleman kicked a 25-yard field goal to give LSU the 9–6 victory.|$|E
5|$|Matters {{changed for}} Barber in the 1932 season, when Yorkshire's regular, long serving opening batsman Percy Holmes began to suffer with illness. This left a batting place empty and enabled Barber to play more regularly. Wisden Cricketer's Almanack {{believed}} that he thoroughly deserved {{his place in the}} team as he scored exactly 1,000 runs at an average of 25.64, the first time he reached four figures in a season. He finished fifth in the Yorkshire batting averages, {{the first time he had}} been placed so high. His runs also played a part in Yorkshire winning the County Championship in his first full season. After this breakthrough, Barber steadily improved his total <b>of</b> <b>runs</b> and batting average, helping Yorkshire to win the County Championship twice in 1933 and 1935. In 1933, he scored 1,595 runs at an average of 33.93, and in 1934 he scored 1,927 runs at an average of 40.14. In both seasons he finished fourth in the Yorkshire averages. However, Barber's best season statistically was the following season, 1935, when he achieved his best aggregate <b>of</b> <b>runs</b> and highest average in an English season, passing 2,000 runs in a season for the only time in his career. He scored 2,147 runs at an average of 42.09 and finished third in the Yorkshire averages. These performances earned him selection for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's Cricket Ground for the only time in his career, where he scored 61 and 18 not out.|$|E

5|$|Across {{the rest}} of the five-match Test series against South Africa, Ring took only seven more wickets, and he tended to be {{expensive}} {{in terms of the number}} <b>of</b> <b>runs</b> conceded from his bowling. In the second match, which the South Africans won, he took three wickets for 187, and, batting at No 10, contributed a quick-fire 53 out of the last 74 runs when the match had already effectively been lost. Two weeks later, in the third match, he took just one wicket in a crushing Australian victory, but contributed 58 out of 75 in just 68 minutes from the unusually lofty batting position of No 8. The fourth and fifth Tests brought him few runs or wickets. In the series as a whole, Ring scored 184 runs at an average of 23 runs per innings and took 13 wickets at the high average of 48.|$|E
5|$|Between 1900 and the 1930s, {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>runs</b> scored by batsmen, and the {{proportion}} of lbw dismissals, continued to rise. Bowlers grew increasingly frustrated with pad-play {{and the extent to which}} batsmen refused to play shots at bowling directed outside the off stump, simply allowing it to pass by. The English fast bowler Harold Larwood responded by targeting leg stump, frequently hitting the batsman with the ball in the process. This developed into the controversial Bodyline tactics he used in Australia in 1932–33. Some batsmen began to go further and preferred to kick away balls pitched outside off stump—reaching out to kick the ball instead of allowing it to hit their pads—if they presented any threat, knowing that they could not be dismissed lbw. The authorities believed these developments represented poor entertainment value. At the height of the Bodyline controversy in 1933, Donald Bradman, the leading Australian batsman and primary target of the English bowlers, wrote to the MCC recommending an alteration of the lbw law to create more exciting games.|$|E

5|$|Between Tests, Brown was rested for {{the match}} against Northamptonshire, which Australia won by an innings. He {{returned}} {{for the second}} fixture against Yorkshire. Opening with Barnes, Brown made 19 as Australia took a 43-run first innings lead. In the second innings, Brown top-scored with 113. He combined with Bradman to add 154 runs for the second wicket as the match petered into a draw. In a patient and restrained display, Brown took four hours to make his century. Following his controversial selection for the tour, Brown was attempting to justify his position in the team by accumulating a large number <b>of</b> <b>runs,</b> but earned criticism for being too dour. However, the century was enough to see him retain his middle-order position for the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia fielded an unchanged team. Former Test leg spinner and teammate Bill O'Reillywho was in England as a journalistcriticised the selection of Brown, who had appeared to be noticeably uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role. He said that despite Brown's unbeaten double century in his previous Test at Lord's in 1938, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey had better claims to selection.|$|E
5|$|Ebsary {{made her}} senior debut for South Australia in the Women's National Cricket League (WNCL) during the 2000–01 {{season at the}} age of 18. Although she played in every match in her first season, she was {{shielded}} from much of the action and made only six runs. Ebsary was selected in every match in her first three seasons, but in that time, scored only 136 runs at a batting average of 8.50 and took 13 wickets from 24 matches. The following year, Ebsary raised her career average above 10 {{for the first time and}} was selected in the Australian Under-23 team. In 2004–05 she made more than 100 runs in a season for the first time, and the following year she made 149 runs at 29.80. In 2006–07, she struggled and totalled only 101 runs at 14.42 and took three wickets, and after the season she transferred to Western Australia. The change of state yielded dividends in the 2007–08 season, as she made 236 runs and took eight wickets, her highest aggregate <b>of</b> <b>runs</b> and wickets in one tournament.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{played a}} key part in Victoria's win over New South Wales away at the SCG. Having taken two catches as the hosts batted first, he made 61 as the {{visitors}} made 234 to take a 52-run first innings lead. After taking another catch in the second innings, he then made an unbeaten 106 to guide the Victorians to their target of 268 with five wickets in hand. Harvey's run-scoring tapered away {{in the last two}} matches of the season; he made 74 runs in three innings in the match. Nevertheless, he ended the season with 699 runs at 49.92; he had made the same number <b>of</b> <b>runs</b> in his first six first-class seasons since his debut in 1947–48. As a result of his performances in this season, he was hailed as the best batsman outside the Australian Test team.|$|E
