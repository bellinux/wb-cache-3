5|$|Alison Hendrix {{returns home}} from rehab {{to find her}} husband Donnie drunk and chastises him. When she catches him trying {{to leave the house}} {{in the middle of the}} night, she persuades him not to give up on their marriage. In an effort to open up to him, she confesses that she played a role in the death of their {{neighbour}} Aynsley, and is shocked when Donnie responds by confessing that he accidentally shot and killed Dr. Aldous Leekie, the director of the Dyad Institute, the night before. When Alison asks what he did with Leekie's body, Donnie leads her to their garage where Leekie's corpse is wrapped in the trunk <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite taking {{victory in}} the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix, Alonso was facing {{pressure}} heading into {{the second half of}} the season; he was forty-seven points behind Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship after scoring four points in the last two races. Alonso had been largely affected by safety car periods in Valencia and Silverstone despite his team having narrowed the performance gap on their championship rivals. However, Alonso remained upbeat about his title chances and said his team had more motivation to succeed despite his recent results. Hamilton, the defending race winner at the Hockenheimring, felt the race would give an indication on form for {{the second half of the}} year and believed McLaren should have a successful balance <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car</b> in order to be competitive at the track.|$|E
5|$|The {{family lived}} in Norman until Warren was 11, when they moved to Oklahoma City. When she was 12, her father, a {{salesman}} at Montgomery Ward, had a heart attack—which led to many medical bills, {{as well as a}} pay cut because he could not do his previous work. Eventually, this led to the loss <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car</b> from failure to make loan payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work in the catalog order department at Sears. When she was 13, Warren started waiting tables at her aunt's restaurant.|$|E

5|$|Timoshenko and his partner, Officer Herman Yan, {{had been}} driving in a marked 71st precinct police car on a routine patrol in Crown Heights, with Timoshenko riding as the {{passenger}} when they spotted a 2003 black BMW sports utility vehicle headed westbound on Lefferts Avenue at 2:30 am. The officers scanned the BMW's license plate on a computer in their police car. When the check came back, it indicated that the plate was assigned to a 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander, not the BMW. Timoshenko and Yan signaled for the vehicle to pull over, and the driver complied, turning north onto Rogers Avenue, where both officers got out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car</b> and approached the stopped vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Gilliat {{served with}} the Rifle Corps in Northern Ireland and Palestine prior to the {{outbreak}} of World War II, and was captured during the Battle of Dunkirk {{as part of the}} British Expeditionary Force. He made several attempts to escape, with one attempt lasting several days, but was transferred to the prisoner-of-war camp Oflag IV-C (Colditz Castle) in 1940 where he remained {{until the end of the}} war. He was mentioned in dispatches and later rewarded with an MBE. After the war Gilliat served as Deputy Military Secretary to Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma during his brief term as the last Viceroy of India in 194748, and as Comptroller to Malcolm Macdonald, the High Commissioner for South-East Asia. In September 1947, while in Mountbatten's service, Gilliat and the author Alan Campbell-Johnson were driving through the Paharganj district of Delhi when they were fired upon. The driver <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car</b> was killed in the incident, and Gilliat suffered a substantial loss of blood, and a superficial head wound.|$|E
5|$|They fly to Spain {{separately}} and meet in Barcelona. They decide their schedule, where {{they plan to}} visit Costa Brava, Seville, and Pamplona. On the way to Costa Brava, Imran and Kabir find it annoying that Arjun works even during the trip. Imran nonchalantly throws Arjun's mobile phone out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car</b> while {{he is in the}} middle of an official call. This leads to a heated argument. Arjun, in a fit of rage, accuses Imran of having an affair, four years prior, with Arjun's previous girlfriend Sonali (a topic which was very sensitive both to Arjun and Imraan). After being pacified by Kabir, they eventually resume their journey. Upon reaching their destination, they meet an Anglo Indian named Laila (Katrina Kaif) on a beach. Imran flirts with her and makes Arjun jealous. Kabir reveals that he has chosen deep sea diving as their first sport, and they later find that Laila is their diving instructor. Arjun, who cannot swim and is aquaphobic, receives assistance from Laila. She helps him overcome his fears and finish the sport successfully. Upon a request by Laila, they attend the La Tomatina festival with her in Buñol and meet Nuria (Ariadna Cabrol), who falls in love with Imraan. Meanwhile, Natasha becomes suspicious of Kabir's involvement with Laila when she sees them via webcam and crashes his bachelor party trip, much to Kabir's discomfort in front of his friends. Imran spends time with Nuria, and Arjun with Laila. After the boys leave, Laila realises she has fallen in love with Arjun and chases them on a bike, not wanting to regret their partition if they do not meet in future. She and Arjun express their feelings for each other with a passionate kiss.|$|E

25|$|Frank and Pauline Jeziorski were {{travelling}} {{south on}} Champ Street and had slowed {{to give way}} to traffic on Sydney Rd when Ryan armed with the rifle appeared in front <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car.</b> Ryan threatened the driver and his passenger wife to get out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car.</b> The driver, Frank Jeziorski, turned his car off, put it in neutral then got out of his vehicle. Ryan got in via the driver's door. Surpisingly, Pauline Jeziorski refused {{to get out of the}} car. She was persuaded by Ryan to get out, only to go back in the car to get her handbag. Paterson, realising Ryan was armed, returned inside the prison to get a rifle.|$|E
25|$|Reception {{to the new}} Taurus by {{automotive}} publications {{was generally}} positive. Road & Track gave the Taurus a good review upon its release, and found its handling and refinement impressive. Motor Trend also gave the Taurus a positive review, although they found the oval styling awkward at first glance. Despite this, they found it to have many redeeming qualities. However, unlike the first-generation Taurus, it fell short <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>Car</b> of the Year award, which was instead awarded to the redesigned 1996 Dodge Caravan.|$|E
25|$|McLaren {{introduced}} a revised version <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car</b> the McLaren MP4-19B in France. The change of car improved reliability and results, helping Coulthard to achieve sixth {{place during the}} Grand Prix, and secured further points in the races in Britain and the Hockenheimring. Coulthard managed to further points in Belgium and Italy, only suffering from one further non-finish from a collision with Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello in Japan. Overall, Coulthard finished tenth in the Drivers' Championship, equal on points with Ralf Schumacher, and McLaren finished fifth in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E

25|$|The formula {{results are}} used to {{calculate}} the team with the fastest time trial time and they are awarded the maximum mark of 55 points. The slowest time is awarded 0 points using this formula. CARTER influences the 'spread' of marks between fastest and slowest. It ensures that a team achieving a very competitive race time, say only a few thousands of a second behind the fastest, scores points that reflect the performance of the car. Teams are rewarded for the speed <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car</b> compared to the fastest time set as opposed to scoring points based on their rank.|$|E
25|$|On September 28, 2010, the Deputy Governor of Ghazni {{and five}} others were killed after {{a suicide bomber}} on a {{motorized}} rickshaw attacked their vehicle. Deputy Governor Mohammad Kazim Allahyar and several men travelling with him were killed instantly when the attacker detonated his explosives at the back <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car</b> near the airport in Ghazni City. The bodies were so badly burnt {{that there was some}} confusion about the identity of the other victims. Provincial police chief Delawar Zahid reported Allahyar's son, nephew and driver died, along with two civilians passing by on a bicycle.|$|E
25|$|Häkkinen {{started off}} the season by {{finishing}} fourth at the Brazil, and later retired in Argentina {{due to a}} collision which punctured his left rear tyre that followed a spin. He managed to take a further points finish with a 5th place at San Marino, before suffering from consecutive retirements {{in the next three}} races. For the French Grand Prix, McLaren introduced a revised version <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car,</b> the McLaren MP4/10B. This did not revive Häkkinen's fortunes as he did not finish in the points scoring positions, and later suffered consecutive retirements in the next four races, but managed to get second place at the Italian Grand Prix. He was forced to miss the Pacific Grand Prix due to an operation for appendicitis and was replaced by Jan Magnussen. He returned for the Japanese Grand Prix, with a second-place finish.|$|E

25|$|Making his début in Spain, Coulthard {{qualified}} {{in eighth}} position, and {{was set to}} score a point before his engine failed 34 laps from the finish. He followed this up by scoring his first points with a fifth-place finish in Canada. Williams dropped Coulthard for the following race in France, allowing 1992 Drivers' Champion Nigel Mansell to make a one-off appearance due to pressure from engine supplier Renault. The move strained the relationship between Williams and Coulthard who returned for the British Grand Prix, finishing fifth. For Germany, Williams introduced a revised version <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car,</b> the Williams FW16B. He suffered back to back retirements {{in the next two}} races but secured three consecutive points scoring positions—including a podium finish with a second-place in Portugal. Mansell later returned to fill Coulthard's seat for the final three races of the season. Coulthard finished the season in eighth place with Williams second in the Constructors' Championship. For his role, Coulthard was awarded ITV Young Sports Personality of the Year and received an award at the BBC Scottish Sports Personality of the Year.|$|E
25|$|But {{the most}} {{significant}} system introduced in F1 was the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS), a system that stores energy created by braking that is stored through a flywheel and this saved energy is then channeled to the car's drivetrain to increase acceleration. A few well funded teams had tested this technology the previous year {{but it was too}} experimental and all of the teams' KERS systems needed more development to the point where none of them would be ready for 2009. Due to the recession, many more rule changes were brought in to reduce the cost of Formula One. Initially a standardised engine was proposed, but this idea was rejected by the teams, who came up with their own cost-cutting measures. These included a huge reduction in testing times and an increase in the required engine and gearbox mileage. Many teams voiced concerns over the cost of KERS and have suggested a standardised unit, but so far no such opportunity exists. The new rules and regulations saw a new order in 2009, with new teams Brawn GP and Red Bull Racing and their drivers leading the way, with Ferrari and McLaren having a poor season. However Ferrari started by the British Grand Prix to make the most <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car</b> with a string of podium finishes and a race victory in Belgium, while a redesign of the McLaren challenger helped Lewis Hamilton to win two races and gain more points than any other driver after it was upgraded at the German Grand Prix. After dominating {{the beginning of the season}} with six out of seven race wins, Jenson Button eventually clinched the Drivers' title in Brazil, with Brawn GP winning the Constructors' Championship in its only season, before being taken over by Mercedes. Rubens Barrichello, Jenson Button's teammate, was second in the Drivers' Championship for the whole season until he had a problem at the Brazilian Grand Prix and was overtaken (in points) by Sebastian Vettel, a Red Bull driver, who won the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to finish eleven points behind Button. Also, the major manufacturer teams were starting to disappear rapidly due to the worldwide economy crisis. In addition to Ford/Jaguar which had left in 2004, Honda had departed in 2008 also due to uncompetitiveness, Toyota and BMW both departed entirely in 2009 (BMW sold Sauber, a team it had bought in 2005 after its split with Williams even though in 2010 the team was still called BMW Sauber), Renault changed their involvement as a full works effort to engine supplier in 2011 and Cosworth departed entirely as an engine supplier in 2013.|$|E

500|$|Two family {{incidents}} {{during this}} time later surfaced during Romney's political campaigns. [...] A state park ranger in 1981 told Romney his motorboat had an insufficiently visible license number {{and that he would}} face a $50fine if he took the boat onto the lake. Disagreeing about the license and wanting to continue a family outing, Romney took it out anyway, saying he would pay the fine. The ranger arrested him for disorderly conduct. The charges were dropped several days later. In 1983, on a twelve-hour family road trip, he placed the family's dog in a windshield-equipped carrier on the roof <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car,</b> and then washed the car and carrier after the dog suffered a bout of diarrhea. [...] The dog incident in particular later became fodder for Romney's critics and political opponents.|$|E
500|$|The {{issue of}} teams using 'customer cars', that is cars {{obtained}} from other teams, surfaced {{before the race}} when Spyker protested the Scuderia Toro Rosso (STR) team's use of cars they claimed had been designed by STR's sister team, Red Bull Racing. The Concorde Agreement, which dictates the terms by which the teams compete in the Formula One world championship, requires teams to design their own cars. The Malaysian stewards rejected the protest, with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA, the sport's governing body) stating that [...] "it would be entirely inappropriate for the Stewards to involve themselves in a matter being dealt with at the instigation and election of the Protestor, Spyker". Red Bull threatened legal action over Spyker's possession <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>car</b> designs to use as evidence against STR, but nothing materialised. The FIA did not investigate how Spyker obtained Red Bull's car designs.|$|E
