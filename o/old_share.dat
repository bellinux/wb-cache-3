In column 2, I add standard socio‐demographic characteristics (education, gender, 5 ‐year interval age dummy variables, marital status, family size, family type, share of children below 9 years <b>old,</b> <b>share</b> of children between 9 and 18 years <b>old,</b> <b>share</b> of individuals over 65 years old in the household). In column 3, I control for region, year and trimester fixed effects. The results still hold when I introduce 12 sectoral dummy variables (ISTAT classification), {{a full set of}} dummy variables for the interaction of region and year to account for labor shocks of the labor market (column 4) and a description of relevant economic features of the province as of 1995 (the sectoral composition of value added and sectoral labor productivity). Introducing occupational dummy variables (1 digit, ISCO 88) reduces the effect by 15 % (column 5), but the coefficient remains negative and significant. 18 Finally, including the share of employment during nonstandard hours in 1994, as computed from the corresponding LFS, allows me to capture potentially unobserved and persistent labor market characteristics that affect both the intensity of nonstandard schedules and the immigrant concentration across provinces; the results, reported in column 6, are substantially unchanged. The IV estimates tend to be larger than the OLS in absolute value when {{controlling for}} regional fixed effects and province characteristics. This finding is consistent with the assumption of a positive correlation between the demand for nonstandard hours and immigrant concentration. Since I am interested in capturing the average effect on native working schedules, I use the IV specification reported in column 4 as the baseline. 19 [...]...|$|E
40|$|In both {{normal and}} {{pathological}} states, cells respond rapidly to environmental cues by synthesizing new proteins. The selective {{identification of a}} newly synthesized proteome has been hindered by the basic fact that all proteins, new and <b>old,</b> <b>share</b> the same pool of amino acids and thus are chemically indistinguishable. We describe here a technology, based on the cotranslational introduction of azide groups into proteins and the chemoselective tagging of azide-labeled proteins with an alkyne affinity tag, to separate and identify, specifically, the newly synthesized proteins in mammalian cells. Incorporation of the azide-bearing amino acid azidohomoalanine is unbiased, not toxic, and does not increase protein degradation. As a first demonstration of the method, we report the selective purification and identification of 195 metabolically labeled proteins with multidimensional liquid chromatography in-line with tandem MS. Furthermore, in combination with leucine-based mass tagging, candidates were immediately validated as newly synthesized proteins. The identified proteins, synthesized in a 2 -h window, possess {{a broad range of}} biochemical properties and span most functional gene ontology categories. This technology makes it possible to address the temporal and spatial characteristics of newly synthesized proteomes in any cell type...|$|E

40|$|International audienceLate onset {{neurodegenerative}} diseases {{represent a}} major public health concern as the population in many countries ages. Both frequent diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD, 14 % incidence for 80 - 84 year old Europeans) or Parkinson disease (PD, 1. 4 % prevalence for > 55 years <b>old)</b> <b>share,</b> with other low-incidence neurodegenerative pathologies such as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs, 0. 01 % prevalence) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD, 0. 02 % prevalence), a lack of efficient treatment in spite of important research efforts. Besides significant progress, studies with animal models have revealed unexpected complexities in the degenerative process, emphasizing a need {{to better understand the}} underlying pathological mechanisms. Recently, microRNAs, a class of small regulatory non-coding RNAs, have been implicated in some neurodegenerative diseases. The current data supporting a role of miRNAs in PD, tauopathies, dominant ataxias and FTLD will first be discussed to emphasize the different levels of the pathological processes which may be affected by miRNAs. To investigate a potential involvement of miRNA dysregulation {{in the early stages of}} these neurodegenerative diseases we have used Drosophila models for 7 diseases (PD, 3 FTLD, 3 dominant ataxias) that recapitulate many features of the human diseases. We performed deep sequencing of head small RNAs after 3 days of pathological protein expression in the fly head neurons. We found no evidence for a statistically significant difference in miRNA expression in this early stage of the pathological process. In addition, we could not identify small non coding CAG repeat RNAs (sCAG) in polyQ disease models. Thus our data suggest that transcriptional deregulation of miRNAs or sCAG is unlikely to play a significant role in the initial stages of neurodegenerative diseases...|$|E
40|$|It may be seen, if {{we address}} {{ourselves}} to certain fundamentals, {{that those who}} are just beginning the study of law and those who are in mid-passage, or growing <b>old,</b> <b>share</b> a common, continuous responsibility for achieving conceptions of law and of legal study adequate to the crises of our time. For appropriate perspective, let us first reflect for a moment upon the social role of the legal profession. Perhaps the best way in brief to describe the distinctive role of the lawyer is to say that he is an especially skilled expert in the use of authoritative language and authoritative procedures for affecting or influencing decisions. Some freshman law students will, thus, if they {{follow in the footsteps of}} their predecessors, themselves become government officials, making decisions in the name of authoritative community expectation and with community coercion behind them. They will, for example, become senators, congressmen, governors, mayors, judges, aldermen, state representatives, delegates to the United Nations, and so on. Others will become the counsellors and advocates, in large and small affairs, of the individuals and groups who seek decisions from such officials. They will become counsel to private business associations, to labor unions, to churches and schools, to political parties and pressure groups, and, in the sum, to all the institutions of our organized community life. Some fifteen years ago Professor Lasswell and I summarized as follows: It should need no emphasis that the lawyer is today, even when not himself a 2 ̆ 2 maker 2 ̆ 2 of policy, the one indispensable adviser of every responsible policy-maker in our society—whether we speak of a government department or agency, of the executive of a corporation or labor union, of the secretary of a trade or other private association, or even of the humble independent enterpriser or professional man.... Certainly it would be difficult to exaggerate either the direct or indirect influence that members of the legal profession exert on the public life of this nation. For better or worse our decision-makers and our lawyers are bound together in a relation of dependence or of identity...|$|E
