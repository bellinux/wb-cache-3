5|$|There {{are some}} {{unresolved}} {{questions concerning the}} definition of work: in particular, whether unpaid endeavors, such as volunteering or studying, are work. Non-work time should not be equated with free time, as it comprises not only free time, dedicated to leisure, but also time dedicated to certain obligatory activities, such as housework. Dividing activities into free and dedicated time is not easy. For example, brushing one's teeth is neither work nor leisure; scholars differ in their classifications of activities such as eating a meal, shopping, repairing a car, attending a religious ceremony, or showering (various individuals {{may or may not}} classify such activities as leisure). The relation between work and leisure can also be unclear: research indicates that some individuals find skills that they have acquired at work useful to their hobbies (and vice versa), and some individuals have used leisure activities to advance their work careers. Sociologists also disagree as to whether political or spiritual activities should be included in studies of leisure. Further, among some occupational communities, such as police officers or miners, it is common for work colleagues to be <b>off-time</b> friends and to share similar, work-based leisure activities.|$|E

In the present work the photophysical characteristics of Venus were analyzed spectroscopically at the bulk and single molecule level. Through time-resolved single molecule measurements we found that single molecules of Venus display pronounced fluctuations in fluorescence emission, with clear fluorescence on- and <b>off-times.</b> These fluorescence intermittencies were found to occupy a broad range of time scales, ranging from milliseconds to several seconds. Such long <b>off-times</b> can complicate the analysis of single molecule counting experiments or single-molecule FRET experiments. status: publishe...|$|R

We show that such a system has a stationary distribution which satisfies a decomposition property where one component in the decomposition is associated with some dam process {{and the other with}} a clearing process.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of using through-mask electrodeposition to fill features with active sidewalls was investigated. Both metal (Ni) and conductive substrates were employed; the demolding of electroformed Ni metal parts from metal substrates was difficult despite {{the use of}} various lubricants. Because of damage to the electrodeposited parts during the demolding process, conductive plastic substrates appear more feasible than metal substrates. Direct current was capable of filling features with low aspect ratios ({approx} 2) with only minor voiding. For higher aspect ratio features ({approx} 7), pulsed deposition and direct current with the leveling agent coumarin appeared {{to be more effective}} than pulsed reverse deposition. Since the characteristic diffusion time constant varies with the square of the feature depth, chloride ions are necessary to prevent passivation during the long pulse <b>off-times</b> required for uniform feature filling through a thick mask. It is shown that although thick masks require long pulse <b>off-times,</b> the recommended deposition rate for uniform filling (available in the literature) should not depend on the mask thickness (although the total deposition time will) ...|$|R

2500|$|Many {{contests}} {{employ a}} concept of [...] "off time" [...] in which a station may operate {{only a portion of}} the available time. [...] For example, the ARRL November Sweepstakes is thirty hours long, but each station may be on the air for no more than twenty-four hours. [...] The <b>off-time</b> requirement forces competitive stations to decide when to be on the air making contacts and when to be off the air, and adds a significant element of strategy to the competition.

[...] These competitions are called [...] "cumulative" [...] contests, and are generally limited to the microwave frequency bands.

40|$|Abstract. Pulse {{electrochemical}} machining (PECM) provides an economical and effective method for machining high strength, heat-resistant materials into complex shapes such as turbine blades, die, molds and micro cavities. Pulse Electrochemical Machining involves {{the application of}} a voltage pulse at high current density in the anodic dissolution process. Small interelectrode gap, low electrolyte flow rate, gap state recovery during the pulse <b>off-times</b> lead to improved machining accuracy and surface finish when compared with ECM using continuous current. This paper presents a mathematical model for PECM and employs this model in a computer simulation of the PECM process for determination of the thermal limitation and energy consumption in PECM.
