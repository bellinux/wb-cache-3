Byly připraveny suché formy liposomů přímých, reaktivních, disperzních a kyselých barviv. Dále byly připraveny liposomy NaCl, u kterých byla přídavkem kationických látek ovlivňována hodnota ZETA potenciálu. Dále byly připraveny liposomy dispergátorů (Spolostan 4 P) a síranu amonného. Jejich účinek v procesu barvení byl srovnatelný s účinkem mikroenkapsulovaného barviva. Pomocí vytahovacích křivek, stanovením sytostí vybarvení a celkové barevné {{diference}} vybarvovaných materiálů byl studován vliv mikroenkapsulovaných forem barviva na změny procesu barvení textilních substrátů za laboratorních podmínek. Byl potvrzen vliv mikroenkapsulace na koloristické chování barviv. Prakticky použitelný je poznatek krytí pruhovitosti polyamidového hedvábí aplikací mikroenkapsulovaných forem kyselých barviv a/nebo síranu amonného. V tomto případě se jedná o nový a dosud nepublikovaný poznatek. Významné je také zvýšení sytosti vybarvení použitím mikroenkapsulovaných forem ve srovnání s typovou formou barviva. The dissertation concerns {{preparation of}} liposomes (<b>microencapsulated</b> <b>forms)</b> of textile dyes and textile auxiliary agents and their conversion into the dry form employing spray dryer. 	Liposomes of direct, reactive, disperse and acid dyes were prepared and converted into the dry form. Liposomes of NaCl were prepared {{and values of}} their ZETA potential were influenced by addition of cationic substances. Liposomes of dispersants (Splostan 4 P) and ammonium sulphate were also prepared.

Lately these products have been formulated with <b>microencapsulated</b> <b>forms</b> of active compounds {{in order to prevent}} their degradation after oral consumption and under processing conditions. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize and encapsulate polyphenols from the aqueous extract of Ganoderma, using ionic gelation of alginate (A) and its combination with whey protein isolates (WPI) and zein (Z). The obtained hydrogel beads were scanned for physico-chemical and morphological properties, encapsulation efficiency of polyphenols, and their release kinetics in simulated gastrointestinal fluids. The addition of WPI to the alginate resulted in the reduction of the particle size and the spherical shape of the beads, while beads formulated with zein were characterized as larger, with irregular morphology. Encapsulation efficiency of total polyphenols has been determined as follows: 76. 91 % (A-WPI) < 83. 91 % (A) < 85. 42 % (A-Z). The most extended release of polyphenols in simulated gastrointestinal fluids has been achieved by employing WPI in the alginate delivery system.

The first immunological fertility control of free-ranging wildlife was accomplished with wild horses, Initial experiments demonstrated that immunization with porcine zonae pellucidae was capable of causing contraception in domestic mares. Later, contraception was achieved with the vaccine in free-ranging horses. That study demonstrated that the vaccine (1) could be delivered remotely via darts, (2) was safe to administer to pregnant animals, and (3) did not alter social behavior. A follow-up study revealed that a single annual booster inoculation would extend the contraceptive effects for a second year, and the vaccine’s effects are reversible after short-term use.

40|$|Background: Saccharomycesboulardiiis a {{probiotic}} clinically effective inthe {{prevention and}} treatment of antibiotic induced diarrheain both children and adults, Clostridium difficile infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and other gastrointestinal disorders. However, the microorganisms need to survive the gastrointestinal transit and arrive to their action site alive in order to exert their beneficial effects. Microencapsulation is an alternative to improve the viability of probiotic in foods which can also survive in the gastrointestinal conditions. Freeze [...] drying is a method of dehydration that does not affect nutrients and bioactive compounds,such as probiotics contained in foods. All of them will increase the survival rate of S. boulardii. Purpose of this study:This study focused on formulae freeze-dried yogurt containing inulin, vegetable palm oil,and S. boulardii, both asfree cells and in <b>microencapsulated</b> <b>form.</b> Also,the effect of ampicillin associated S. boulardii. Methods. Yogurts were given to an “in vivo” digestion process, using male Wistar rats. The survival of S. boulardiiwas subsequently evaluated in colon and feces. For this study, six treatmentsof four of rats were used:i) control rats ii) rats fed with yogurt containing S. boulardiias free cells, iii) rats fed with yogurt containing S. boulardiiinmicro-encapsulated form, iv) control rats fed with penicillin,v) rats fed with ampicillin plus yogurtcontaining S. boulardiias free cells, and vi) rats fed with penicillin plus yogurt containing S. boulardiiin micro-encapsulated form. Results:The study demonstrated it was feasible to freeze-drythe S. boulardiiand incorporate it into a yogurtmade with skim milk,inulin, and unsaturated vegetable oil.

40|$|Fire-extinguishing agents {{comprising}} microscopic {{drops of}} water microencapsulated in flame-retardant polymers have been proposed as effective, less toxic, non-ozone-depleting, non-globalwarming alternatives to prior fire-extinguishing agents. Among the prior fire-extinguishing agents are halons (various halocarbon fluids), which are toxic and contribute both to depletion of upperatmospheric ozone and to global warming. Other prior fire-extinguishing agents are less toxic and less environmentally harmful but, in comparison with halons, are significantly less effective in extinguishing fires. The proposal to formulate new waterbased agents is based on recent success {{in the use of}} water mist as a fire-suppression agent. Water suppresses a flame by reducing the flame temperature and the concentration of oxygen available for the combustion process. The temperature is reduced because the water droplets in the mist absorb latent heat of vaporization as they evaporate. The concentration of oxygen is reduced because the newly generated water vapor displaces air. Unfortunately, water mists are difficult to produce in confined spaces and can evaporate before they reach the bases of flames. The proposal addresses both of these issues: The proposed fire-extinguishing agents would be manufactured in <b>microencapsulated</b> <b>form</b> in advance, eliminating the problem of generating mists in confined spaces. Because of the microencapsulation, the droplets would not evaporate until exposed directly to the heat of flames. In addition, the proposal calls for the introduction of free radicals that would inhibit the propagation of the chemical reactions of the combustion reactions. Manufacturing of a fire-extinguishing agent according to the proposal would begin with the formulation of a suitable polymer (e. g., a polybromostyrene) that would contribute free radicals to the combustion process. The polymer would be dissolved in a suitable hydrocarbon liquid (e. g., toluene). Water would be dispersed in the polymer/toluene solution, then another hydrocarbon liquid (e. g., hexane) that is not a solvent for the polymer would be added to the mixture to make the dissolved polymer precipitate onto the water droplets. The resulting polymer-coated droplets would be removed from the coating mixture by filtration, dried, and stored for use...|$|R

This {{special issue}} {{will cover the}} different interests of microencapsulation {{as a means to}} control or modify the release of drug substances from drug delivery systems. To overcome the drug stability problem, since clinical efficacies have been reported to be improved by the encapsulation of pharmaceuticals, the bioavailability of drugs, control drug release kinetics, minimizing drug side effects, and taste masking of the drug substances. Microencapsulation is process of enclosing micro sized particles in a polymeric shell. There are different techniques available for the encapsulation of drug entities. Most of the applied techniques of micro-encapsulation are based on modifications of the four basic methods: spray-drying, phase separation (coacervation), gelation and solvent extraction/evaporation. The encapsulation efficiency of the microparticle or microsphere or microcapsule depends upon different factors like concentration of the polymer, solubility of polymer in solvent, rate of solvent removal, solubility of organic solvent in water etc. The present review article provides a different microencapsulation techniques and different factors influencing the encapsulation efficiency of the microencapsulation techniques based on research studies reported...|$|R
40|$|Context: A {{functional}} {{extract from}} Lannea microcarpa (Lm), possess interesting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the unprocessed dried extract occurs as sticky and low-water-soluble material showing critical properties for industrial applications. The unprocessed dried extract {{is not always}} enough stable to preserve its functional properties, also giving practical difficulties for the manufacturing. Aims: This research aimed to produce Lm extract microparticles with enhanced functional stability and technological characteristics by spray-drying. Methods: Lm extract was microencapsulated by spray-drying using a sodium-carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC) based matrix. Physicochemical and technological characteristics (determined by UV, HPLC, LLS, SEM, DSC, and in vitro dissolution tests), as well as antioxidant properties (DPPH-test) of the resulting powder (LmC) were examined. Results: The produced spray dried microparticles showed satisfying encapsulation efficiency, good functional stability and enhanced technological properties.

40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{expensive}} variable input costs for corn production. Optimized manure management is essential to ensure maximum crop N utilization and to reduce the risk of N loss. A field study was conducted in central Indiana from 2011 - 2013 to assess liquid swine (Sus scrofa L.) manure N availability when applied at different times or co-applied with InstinctTM, a <b>microencapsulated</b> <b>form</b> of nitrapyrin. Soil inorganic N contents, soil N mineralization, corn yield, grain N content, whole plant N concentrations of corn at the V 6 growth stage, and ear leaf N concentrations of corn at the R 1 growth stage differed from year to year and were greatly influenced by manure application timing and climatic conditions. ^ A static cup incubation was used to assess N mineralization from soil samples collected at two depths (0 - 30 cm and 30 - 60 cm) at various times after manure application (early winter, planting and corn V 6 growth stage). The cumulative net N mineralization was fitted to a first-order exponential model to determine potentially mineralizable N (N 0) and the N mineralization rate constant (k). ^ Cumulative mineralizable N up to 16 weeks was not affected by liquid swine manure application timing or the use of InstinctTM at both soil depths. Differences in total soil inorganic N recovered after incubation were mainly due to initial inorganic N differences. Negligible amounts of NH 4 +-N were recovered from soil extracts in all treatment plots during the incubation study, indicating that nitrification occurred and that there was little efficacy from InstinctTM at controlling nitrification at the time of soil sample collection. ^ Spring application of liquid swine manure (165 kg manure total N/ha) showed greater corn grain yield and grain N content (6. 9 Mg/ha and 61. 2 kg N/ha) compared to early fall applications (138 kg manure total N/ha, 5. 1 Mg/ha and 44. 6 kg N/ha) at Location 3 in the 2013 growing season, while in the 2012 growing season corn yield was unaffected by manure application timing. Distinct climatic conditions, especially precipitation, between these two years were considered a main source of yearly inconsistence. Corn growth and yield was unaffected by the addition of InstinctTM at any location. Primary factors that could have affected the efficacy of this nitrification inhibitor include: i) InstinctTM runoff or leaching from the soil before nitrapyrin is released from the polymer microcapsules; ii) inadequate release rate and concentration of nitrapyrin from InstinctTM with time in soil; iii) sorption of released nitrapyrin by organic matter and clay minerals in soils; iv) efficacy of released nitrapyrin on nitrifiers under the varying soil moisture and temperatures encountered during this field study; and v) insufficient rainfall to cause significant N loss in the field. ...|$|R

Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus isolated from a commercial product were formulated in capsules, enteric coated, and then given to both Escherichia coli-challenged and unchallenged baby pigs. Decreased incidence {{and severity of}} diarrhea, and decreased weight deceleration showed that the enteric coated lactobacilli had more beneficial effects than nonenteric coated bacteria. A methodology for microencapsulating live lactobacilli with aqueous enteric polymers has been developed successfully (Chapter II).

Talc smoothed the coating, made application of coating solution easier, and stabilized previously adsorbed microorganisms. Dissolution tests and scanning electron microscopy were used to evaluate the homogeneity of the aqueous enteric polymer film. The enteric coated <b>microencapsulated</b> dosage <b>form</b> may not only provide more uniform action, but also protect lactobacilli from oxygen and increase their shelf-life.

Chlorhexidine (CHX) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that can bring benefits to sealants. This study will be presented in two chapters, whose objectives were: Chapter 1) To develop and characterize polymeric microparticles loaded with CHX; and Chapter 2) To evaluate the effect of incorporation of CHX, in free and <b>microencapsulated</b> <b>forms,</b> in the physicochemical properties of resin sealants. Material and methods: 1) Polymer microparticles of Poly(lactide-co-glycolide acid) (PLGA) loaded with diacetate (DA) and CHX digluconate (DG) were prepared using the spray drying technique and characterized in terms of stability, production yield, particle size, morphology, efficiency encapsulation (EE), drug loading (DL), cumulative release and antimicrobial response. 2) Two types of CHX (DA or DG), in respective free form 1 and 2 %, or <b>microencapsulated</b> <b>form</b> 5 and 10 % were added to the resin sealant with fluoride, BiosealÂ (BI), or to the experimental sealant (EX) without fluoride. After obtaining the sealants formulations, tests were conducted to evaluate degree of conversion of the monomers, CHX release in dissolution media and fluoride release. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) Two-way, followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test. In all tests the level of confidence was 95 % (p < 0. 05). Results: 1) The stability of drug in solution was detected for 50 days. The highest yield of production was observed with DA (over 71. 56 %). The particle size ranged from 1. 01 to 3. 07 Âm, presenting homogeneous, spherical and non-aggregated microparticles. The microencapsulation process showed EE in the range of 4. 42 to 36. 67 %, and DL between 0. 26 and 4. 07 % amoung the formulations. It was observed a controlled release pattern. After the microbiological analysis, in vitro, DA and DG microparticles inhibited Streptococcus mutans. 2) In degree of conversion test, the mean values varied from the lowest DC for BI-PDG 10 (69. 74 %) to the highest DC for EX-DG 2 (77. 69 %). In the sealants containing free CHX (either DG or DA), the release was discrete from the first 6 h, except for EX-DG 1 and EX-DA 2 groups. In the experimental sealant, the highest release was detected in EX-PDA 5 (22. 91 %), while EX-PDG 5 (8. 00 %) and EX-PDG 10 (8. 99 %) presented the lowest releases (p< 0. 001). In the fluoride release test, BI-DA 1 showed the highest release when compared to the other sealants that contained free CHX (p< 0. 01). In the sealants containing CHX loaded PLGA-microparticles, the highest fluoride release was detected from BI-PDA 5 (p< 0. 01). Conclusion: The characterization of microparticles loaded with CHX resulted in different release profiles. Addition of free or microencapsulated CHX into sealants affected the DC, {{depending on the type of}} CHX and sealant.

40|$|Polyethylene {{microencapsulation}} physically homogenizes and incorporates mixed waste particles {{within a}} molten polymer matrix, forming a solidified final waste form upon cooling. Each individual particle of waste is embedded within the polymer block and {{is surrounded by}} a durable, leach-resistant coating. The process has been successfully applied for the treatment of a broad range of mixed wastes, including evaporator concentrate salts, soil, sludges, incinerator ash, off-gas blowdown solutions, decontamination solutions, molten salt oxidation process residuals, ion exchange resins, granular activated carbon, shredded dry active waste, spill clean-up residuals, depleted uranium powders, and failed grout waste forms. For waste streams containing high concentrations of soluble toxic metal contaminants, additives can be used to further reduce leachability, thus improving waste loadings while meeting or exceeding regulatory disposal criteria. In this configuration, contaminants are both chemically stabilized and physically solidified, making the process a true stabilization/solidification (S/S) technology. Unlike conventional hydraulic cement grouts or thermosetting polymers, thermoplastic polymers such as polyethylene require no chemical. reaction for solidification. Thus, a stable, solid, final waste form product is assured on cooling. Variations in waste chemistry over time do not affect processing parameters and do not require reformulation of the recipe. Incorporation of waste particles within the polymer matrix serves as an aggregate and improves the mechanical strength and integrity of the waste form. The compressive strength of polyethylene <b>microencapsulated</b> waste <b>forms</b> varies based on the type and quantity of waste encapsulated, but is typically between 7 and 17. 2 MPa (1000 and 2500 psi), well above the minimum strength of 0. 4 MPa (160 psi) recommended by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for low-level radioactive waste forms in support of 10 CFR 61 (NRC, 1991; 1983) Because polyethylene is a relatively new material, it is difficult to predict its long-term durability. However, prior to scale-up of the microencapsulation process, a study was conducted to evaluate potential degradation mechanisms. The study examined potential effects on mechanical integrity from exposure to chemicals and solvents, thermal cycling, saturated environments, microbial attack, and high gamma-radiation fields (Kalb et al., 1991). At ambient temperatures, polyethylene is relatively inert to most chemicals, including organic solvents, acids, and alkaline solutions. Exposure to changes in temperature or saturated soil conditions have been shown to degrade the mechanical integrity of some waste forms, but had little or no measurable impact on polyethylene waste forms. Low-density polyethylene is not susceptible to growth of microbial organisms, a fact that is evidenced by the lack of plastics decomposition in municipal waste landfills. When exposed to gamma-radiation at total doses of up to lo 8 rad, additional cross-linking of the polymer occurs, resulting in increased strength and lower leachability...|$|R
40|$|Aims/hypothesis. This study {{aimed to}} assess a {{response}} of microencapsulated rat islets to a meal challenge after being transplanted intraperitoneally into diabetic mice. Methods. Microencapsulated rat: islets or control naked syngeneic mouse islets were transplanted intraperitoneally into mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Meal challenges were done 3, 6 and 9 weeks after transplantation. Glucose-induced insulin secretion from microencapsulated islets {{before and after}} transplantation was assessed in vitro. Results. Within the first week, all animals transplanted with either microencapsulated rat islets or with syngeneic murine islets became normoglycaemic (< 11 mmol/l), At 4 and 6 weeks, body weight was less than normal in the non-diabetic control mice. Mice with the encapsulated rat islets had lower fasting glucose concentrations and more rapid glucose clearance after a meal challenge than the control mice, The group of mice with transplanted syngeneic islets had similar glucose profiles to control mice, except for slightly accelerated glucose clearance, The C peptide responses of mice with either microencapsulated or naked islets were clearly lower than the controls, An increase of C peptide appeared as early as 20 min in the plasma of the group with encapsulated islets, but this was considerably slower than in the <b>other</b> two groups, <b>Microencapsulated</b> rat islets retrieved 9 weeks after transplantation did not lose their {{ability to respond to}} glucose, but their output was {{less than half of the}} pretransplant control islets, Conclusions/interpretation. The delivery of C peptide and presumably the accompanying insulin are delayed by restrictions of the capsules and the peritoneal location, However, this delay in reaching peripheral target organs does not prevent microencapsulated grafts from efficiently clearing glucose after a meal...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{insulin therapy}} {{transplantation}} of immunoisolated islets of Langerhans is investigated as treatment for type 1 diabetes. However oxygen supply plays {{a crucial role}} for graft survival and function. In previous studies we could demonstrate, that immobilized hemoglobin inside the capsule matrix leads to a significantly increased function and viability of microencapsulated islets. Because a more efficient oxygen supply caused by hemoglobin could be excluded, the present study investigated, whether the iron contained in the Hb molecule is responsible for the positive effect of Hb. This was realized by substitution of Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + cations in the precipitant for alginate (BaCl 2) {{on the one hand and}} by immobilization of iron-containing factors inside the capsule matrix Transferrin (Tf), erythrocytes (Ery), hemolysated erythrocytes (hEry), Hemoglobin (Hb), and Albumin (Alb) on the <b>other</b> hand. Ba-alginate <b>microencapsulated</b> neonatal rat islets were used as control group. The absolute insulin secretion, the relative stimulatory response to glucose and the viability before and after 4 weeks of culture was determined. During the culture period insulin secretion declined in all groups investigated. The absolute insulin secretion of the Hb-containing group and of the Alb-containing group, however, was significantly increased (p Ery-, hEry-, Fe 2 +-, Fe 3 +-, Tf-containing microcapsules have shown no beneficial effect on function and survival of microencapsulated neonatal rat islets. This may be due to technical problems during the microencapsulation process of the Tf- and Ery- containing capsules (solubility of Tf in alginate, conglomeration of erythrocytes, increased viscosity of the alginate matrix etc.). The beneficial effect of immobilized Hb inside the alginate matrix of micro-encapsulated islets as be shown in former investigations could be reproduced by the present data. This effect, however, may be caused by other factors than by iron. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the efficiency of transfer of selenium (Se) to plasma and milk from inorganic sodium selenite, either free or microencapsulated, and from selenized yeast in dairy cows. The study consisted of an in situ-nylon bags incubation, and in an in vivo experiment to compare the Se status of cows supplemented with either sodium selenite, microencapsulated sodium selenite, or Se yeast. Thirty dairy cows, divided in five groups, were fed the following diets: the control group (CTR) received a total mixed ration supplemented with sodium selenite in order to have 0. 3 mg/kg DM of total Se; 0. 3 M and 0. 5 M groups received the same control diet supplemented with lipid microencapsulated sodium selenite to provide 0. 3 and 0. 5 mg/kg DM of total Se, respectively; 0. 3 Y and 0. 5 Y groups received selenized yeast to provide 0. 3 and 0. 5 mg/kg of total Se, respectively. Cows were fed the supplements for 56 days during which milk, blood, and fecal samples were collected weekly to conduct analysis of Se and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) activity. Se concentration in the nylon bags was assessed to 72 %, 64 %, and 40 % of the initial value (time 0) after 4, 8, and 24 h of incubation, respectively. In vivo, cows supplemented with 0. 3 mg/kg of microencapsulated Se had higher milk Se concentration compared to CTR. The increment was more pronounced at the highest inclusion rate (0. 5 mg/kg, 0. 5 M group). GSH-px activity was not significantly affected by treatments. The results indicate that lipid microencapsulation has the potential to protect nutrients from complete rumen reduction and that Se from microencapsulated selenite is incorporated in milk more efficiently than the free <b>form.</b> <b>Microencapsulated</b> sodium selenite was shown to be comparable to Se-yeast in terms of availability and incorporation in milk when fed at 0. 3 mg/kg DM, whereas the inclusion in the diet at 0. 5 mg/kg DM resulted in higher plasma and milk concentrations than selenized yeast...|$|R
40|$|Dissertação (mestrado) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Centro de Ciências Agrárias, Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciência dos Alimentos, Florianópolis, 2009. Em uma primeira etapa do trabalho foi comparado o efeito de duas técnicas de microencapsulação na viabilidade de Lactobacillus acidophilus (La- 5) durante a estocagem em baixa temperatura e sob condições gastrointestinais simuladas. Para isso a bactéria probiótica foi microencapsulada em gel de alginato por emulsificação e por spray drying. As diferentes microcápsulas foram submetidas à análise de microestrutura e a testes de sobrevivência em - 18 ± 2 ºC, em pHs ácidos (pH 1, 0, 2, 0 e 3, 0) e em sais de bile (0, 5 % e 1, 0 %). Tanto a microencapsulação por emulsificação como a microencapsulação por spray drying, foram eficientes para a proteção da bactéria probiótica contra possíveis danos causados pela estocagem em baixa temperatura. Entretanto, a técnica de emulsificação produziu microcápsulas menos resistentes às condições de pH ácido e sais de bile do que o spray drying. Considerando estes resultados, em uma segunda etapa do trabalho dois sorvetes foram elaborados, um contendo a bactéria probiótica livre (não encapsulada) e o outro contendo a bactéria probiótica microencapsulada por spray drying. Foi avaliada a influencia da microencapsulação na viabilidade da bactéria probiótica adicionada no sorvete e nas características físico-químicas e aceitabilidade sensorial do produto. A microencapsulação melhorou significativamente (p < 0, 05) a viabilidade da bactéria probiótica durante 12 semanas de estocagem dos sorvetes. O conteúdo de células livres diminuiu 0, 35 ciclos log após as 12 semanas, enquanto que o conteúdo de células microencapsuladas diminuiu 0, 27 ciclos log. Quanto às características físico-químicas, houve diferença significativa (p < 0, 05) entre os valores de umidade, lipídios, proteínas, carboidratos totais, acidez e pH dos sorvetes. Porém a microencapsulação não influenciou a aceitabilidade sensorial do produto, sendo que ambos os sorvetes foram sensorialmente aceitos pelos julgadores. Os sorvetes foram considerados bons veículos para a ingestão de probióticos, pois apresentaram contagem de células viáveis {{superior}} a 106 UFC/mL durante todo o período de estudo. In a {{first stage}} of the work the effect of two microencapsulation techniques was compared in the viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus (La - 5) during the storage in low temperature and under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. For that the probiotic bacteria was microencapsulated in alginate gel for emulsification and for spray drying. The different microcapsules were submitted to the microstructure analysis and to survival test in - 18 ± 2 ºC, in acid pHs (pH 1. 0, 2. 0 and 3. 0) and in bile salts (0. 5 % and 1. 0 %). Both the microencapsulation for emulsification and the microencapsulation for spray drying were efficient {{for the protection of}} the probiotic bacteria against possible damages caused by the storage in low temperature. However, the emulsification technique produced less resistant microcapsules to the conditions of acid pH and bile salts than the spray drying. Considering these results, in a second stage of the work two ice creams were elaborated, one containing the free probiotic bacteria (non-encapsulated) and the <b>other</b> containing the <b>microencapsulated</b> probiotic bacteria for spray drying. It was evaluated the influence of the microencapsulation in the viability of the probiotic bacteria added in the ice cream and in the physico-chemical characteristics and sensorial acceptability of the product. The microencapsulation improved significantly (p < 0. 05) the viability of the probiotic bacteria during 12 weeks of storage of the ice creams. The content of free cells reduced 0. 35 cycles log after the 12 weeks, while the content of microencapsulated cells reduced 0. 27 cycles log. As for the physico-chemical characteristics, there was significant difference (p < 0. 05) among the humidity values, lipids, proteins, total carbohydrates, acidity and pH of the ice creams. However the microencapsulation didn't influence the sensorial acceptability of the product, and both ice creams were sensorially accepted by the judges. The ice creams were considered good vehicles for the probiotics ingestion, because they presented superior counting of viable cells to 106 UFC / g during the whole study period...|$|R
