25|$|The usual {{response}} to a bouncer is for the batsman simply to duck underneath it, but this requires fast reflexes and a strong nerve and the batsman is sometimes hit in any case. The natural reflex is to attempt to defend one's head with a straight bat but this should be suppressed if possible as the likely result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> that the ball flies off the bat at an uncontrolled angle making for an easy catch. Most batsman have panicked and lost their wickets in this fashion several times in their career after prolonged spells of bouncers.|$|E

2500|$|Led by the provincially owned utility, SaskPower, {{one of the}} world's {{first and}} largest full {{production}} carbon capture facilities is operating at the coal fired Boundary Dam Power Station. With an initial investment of $1.5 to $1.6 billion. Of the 90% of CO2 emissions captured, about a half <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> sold and permanently sequestered in enhanced oil recovery.

In 2016 the contracts to sell CO2 were renegotiated to reflect the reduced sales.|$|E
2500|$|The normal {{convention}} in topological studies {{means that a}} protein is shown with the biggest domain on the left-hand side and the smallest domain on the right-hand side. In this position the smaller domain is in turn divided into two: subdomain I (lower position, residues 1-32, 70-144 and 338-374) and subdomain II (upper position, residues 33-69). The larger domain is also divided in two: subdomain III (lower, residues 145-180 and 270-337) and subdomain IV (higher, residues 181-269). The exposed areas of subdomains I and III {{are referred to as}} the “barbed” ends, while the exposed areas of domains II and IV are termed the “pointed" [...] ends. This nomenclature refers to the fact that, due to the small mass of subdomain II actin is polar; the importance <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> discussed below in the discussion on assembly dynamics. Some authors call the subdomains Ia, Ib, IIa and IIb, respectively.|$|E

In October 2014, Lydon expanded on his original quote, saying: [...] "By killed I meant locking him up and stopping him assaulting young children...

2500|$|When {{exchange}} rates are fixed by a rigid gold standard, or when imbalances exist {{between members of}} a currency union such as the Eurozone, the standard approach to correct imbalances is by making changes to the domestic economy. [...] To a large degree, the change is optional for the surplus country, but compulsory for the deficit country. [...] In {{the case of a}} gold standard, the mechanism is largely automatic. [...] When a country has a favourable trade balance, as a consequence of selling more than it buys it will experience a net inflow of gold. [...] The natural effect <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> to increase the money supply, which leads to inflation and an increase in prices, which then tends to make its goods less competitive and so will decrease its trade surplus. [...] However the nation has the option of taking the gold out of economy (sterilising the inflationary effect) thus building up a hoard of gold and retaining its favourable balance of payments. On the other hand, if a country has an adverse BoP it will experience a net loss of gold, which will automatically have a deflationary effect, unless it chooses to leave the gold standard. Prices will be reduced, making its exports more competitive, and thus correcting the imbalance. While the gold standard is generally considered to have been successful up until 1914, correction by deflation to the degree required by the large imbalances that arose after WWI proved painful, with deflationary policies contributing to prolonged unemployment but not re-establishing balance. Apart from the US most former members had left the gold standard by the mid-1930s.|$|E

Pursuing the {{principle}} yet further, {{it is obvious}} that for producing the greatest effect, not only should the main divisions of a sentence observe this sequence, but the subdivisions of these should be similarly arranged. In nearly all cases, the predicate is accompanied by some limit or qualification, called its complement. Commonly, also, the circumstances of the subject, which form its complement, have to be specified. And as these qualifications and circumstances must determine the mode in which the acts and things they belong to are conceived, precedence should be given to them. Lord Kaimes notices the fact that this order is preferable; though without giving the reason. He says:--"When a circumstance is placed {{at the beginning of the}} period, or near the beginning, the transition from it to the principal subject is agreeable: it is like ascending or going upward."
