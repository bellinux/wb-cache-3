The use of country-spe-cific data that reflects fuel and technology character-istics is needed for accurate GHG emissions estima-tion. Oxidation factors are used to convert existing data into equivalent GHG emissions, and changes in these oxidation factors are directly related to chang-es in emissions. As such, the <b>oxidation</b> <b>factor</b> {{is one of the most}} important variables in using country-spe-cific data to determine GHG emissions. In this study, the <b>oxidation</b> <b>factor</b> of bituminous coal in large scale boilers was estimated using 4, 527 data points sam-pled from eight large-scale boilers that had been using bituminous coal for two years. The average <b>oxidation</b> <b>factor</b> was determined to be 0. 997, which is lower than the <b>oxidation</b> <b>factor</b> of 1 that is recom-mended by the IPCC G/L for large scale boilers when estimating national GHG emissions.

40|$|The methane (CH 4) {{emissions}} from {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) landfills in China in 2007 were estimated based on database of the three-dimensional emission factors matrix and point sources, by an IPCC recommended FOD (firstorder decay) model. The location, capacity and age of landfills constitute the three dimensions of the emission factors matrix, which were obtained by laboratory analysis and in situ investigation. Key parameters such as waste composition, degradable organic carbon ratio, CH 4 correction factor, <b>oxidation</b> <b>factor</b> and recovery rate, were carefully analyzed in terms of these three dimensions. The point sources database consists of 2, 107 MSW landfills in cities and towns of China in 2007. The {{results show that the}} CH 4 {{emissions from}} MSW landfills were 1. 186 Mt in 2007. Compared with the CH 4 emissions of 2. 20 Mt in 2005, the significant discrepancy mainly comes from statistical data of landfills, e. g., number of landfills and amount of waste disposed in landfills. CH 4 emissions were lower than 700 t for most of the landfills, whereas there were 279 landfills with emissions larger than 1, 000 t, and only 10 landfills with emissions larger than 10, 000 t. Jiangsu province ranks the largest emitter with 98, 700 t while Tibet is the smallest emitter with 2, 100 t. In general, the emissions from eastern provinces, such as Jiangsu, Guangdong and Zhejiang, were larger than those from western provinces, such as Ningxia, Tibet and Qinghai.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} concerns on {{the severity of}} climate change, CO 2 emissions have become a serious problem in China because of the country&# 39;s heavy reliance on fossil fuels as an energy source. Therefore, precise quantification of the CO 2 emissions that occur in China is of serious concern. Although most studies focus on CO 2 emissions from power plant and cement production, the emissions from {{iron and steel industry}} is not well researched. The iron and steel industries, the energy consumptions of which are high compared {{to the rest of the}} world, are confronted with an increasing demand to reduce CO 2 emissions. Data on CO 2 emissions derived from iron and steel-making is a basic requirement for a certificate of CO 2 reduction. This is the first study to present an analysis of CO 2 emissions from China&# 39;s iron and steel industry, and we have estimated the direct emissions, including coal fired emission:non fossil fuel combustion emission and indirect emissions. Carbon flows from blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace steel-making systems are analyzed using Material Flow Analysis. The computation method of coal <b>oxidation</b> <b>factors</b> is built and used to estimate the CO 2 emissions of China in 2011 based on the production data of twenty typical iron and steel enterprises. The types of coal involved in iron and steel-making systems include coking coal, sintering (pelletizing) coal and spray-blow coal. It was determined that the coal <b>oxidation</b> <b>factors</b> of coking coal, sintering coal and spray-blow coal are 0. 9351, 0. 9995, and 0. 9745, respectively. Based on the consumption and emission factors of different types of coal used in iron and steel-making systems, the total quantity of CO 2 emissions of China in 2011 was estimated to be 1336 million tons, which is 7. 06 % lower than the result calculated with the parameters offered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in which the contribution of coking coal is the largest at 79. 2 %.

40|$|The {{properties}} of factors present in boiled yeast juice which stimulate the oxidative breakdown of citrate in baker's yeast have been investigated. The activity {{has been shown}} to reside predominantly in the nucleotide fractions (i. e., pyridine codehydrogenases) {{and to a lesser extent}} in the ammonium salts present in whole yeast cells. The activity of the Citrate <b>Oxidation</b> <b>Factor</b> (COF) concentrated from yeast extracts and described by Foulkes (Biochem. J. 54 323 (1953)) was attributable entirely to the ammonium content of COF preparations. This activating effect of ammonium ions is accompanied by their removal from the assay system and the simultaneous production of glutamic acid. Correlation of the uptake of ammonium ion with the increased citrate metabolism indicates that the activity of the ammonium salts lies in their ability to promote the reductive amination of α-oxoglutarate. The mechanism(s) whereby this serves to stimulate the further breakdown of citrate to oxoglutarate involves the mediation of the pyridine codehydrogenases (DPN, TPN). These findings are discussed in relation to the known functioning of individual stains of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and to possible alternative pathways for the oxidation of citrate in yeast. A study has been made of the incorporation of 35 S into rabbit duodenal mucin after intravenous administration of Na 2 35 SO 4 and DL 35 S-methionine. Within 1 hour, 35 S-sulphate and 35 S-methionine were present in the nondialysable mucosubstances which constitute the viscosity-raising agents of the mucin. The maximum incorporation of both the sulphate and the methionine into these mucosubstances was found after a period of 4 hours. Following the administration of Na 2 35 SO 4, appreciable amounts of inorganic 35 SO 4 " and a dialysable ester 35 sulphate were excreted into the mucin. The influence of cortisone on mucin production was studied using these isotopically-labelled compounds. In contract to the many reports in the literature concerning the inhibitory effect of cortisone on the biosynthesis or sulphated mucosubstances in mesenchymal tissues, cortisone acetate was found to have no appreciable influence on the biosynthesis of the (epithelial) mucosubstances in duodenal mucin. Some studies on the composition of the duodenal mucosubstances of both pig and rabbit are also reported. In part III the development and use of a micromethod for the estimation of 3 - 15 μg. inorganic and esterfied sulphate is described.

Los objetivos de este trabajo son cuantificar esos gradientes, en un establecimiento de Tornquist (provincia de Buenos Aires) y evaluar la sensibilidad de distintos índices de calidad edáfica. En un sector plano se seleccionaron tres posiciones: 1) bajo el alambradro («alambre»); 2) a 3 - 4 m del alambrado («borde») y 3) a 15 m del perímetro («interior»). En cada una se extrajeron tres muestras compuestas, a dos profundidades 0 - 6 y 0 - 12 cm. Se efectuaron los siguientes análisis: pH; fósforo extraíble (P BK); boro extraíble (Bext), nitrógeno orgánico total (Not), potasio (Kint), calcio (Ca int) y magnesio intercambiables (Mg int). Se determinó carbono orgánico (CO), oxidable con distintas concentraciones de ácido sulfúrico y CO total (COT), por combustión seca. Se calcularon fracciones de CO de oxidabilidad creciente. El P BK fue la determinación química más variable. Las profundidades analizadas tuvieron menor impacto sobre las determinaciones que las posiciones, aún con cuatro años previos bajo siembra directa. El pH, Ca int y Mg int no disminuyeron por uso agrícola, confirmando su estabilidad en los sistemas mixtos del SO bonaerense. Algunos de los índices más sensibles a los efectos estudiados (P BK, CO fácilmente oxidable) estuvieron asociados positivamente. Se registraron pérdidas de 43 y 490 kg ha- 1 de P BK y de Kint, en la profundidad de 0 - 12 cm, correspondiendo, el 84 % y el 71 % a los primeros seis cm. El COT disminuyó en un tercio en «interior». La tasa de oxidación del CO fue significativamente mayor para «alambre» a 0 - 6 cm.

The objectives of this work are to quantify these gradients, in an establishment of Tornquist (province of Buenos Aires) and to evaluate the sensitivity of different soil quality indices. Three positions were selected in a field: 1) below the wire fence («alambre»); 2) 3 - 4 m from the fence («borde») and 3) 15 m from the fence («interior»). In each position, three composite samples were extracted, at two depths 0 - 6 and 0 - 12 cm. Soil samples were tested for pH; extractable phosphorus (P BK) and boron (Bext), total organic nitrogen (Not), exchangeable potassium (Kint), calcium (Ca int) and magnesium (Mg int). Determinations of organic carbon (CO) included total CO (COT) by dry combustion and oxidizable carbon (COX) by Walkley and Black (W-B). Fractions of CO of increasing oxidability were calculated from determinations using different concentrations of sulfuric acid. P BK was the most variable soil test. The analyzed depths had a smaller impact on the variables than the positions, even after four years under no-till. pH, Ca int and Mg int did not decrease with agricultural use, confirming their stability in mixed systems of southwestern Buenos Aires.

The mechanism of lipid and protein <b>oxidation,</b> <b>factors</b> influencing lipid <b>oxidation,</b> the consequences of protein oxidation, measurement methods, and the interactions between lipid oxidation, protein oxidation and meat color are introduced. The present thesis was aiming to {{study the effects of}} different fatty acid composition on lipid oxidation, protein oxidation and meat color in minced pork stored in modified atmosphere packages (80 % O 2, 20 % CO 2) at 5 oC during 12 days of storage. The possible interactions between lipid oxidation, protein oxidation and meat color were also investigated. Minced meat differing in fatty acid composition was prepared by mixing lean minced meat and fat fractions obtained by dry fractionation. Three groups of minced meat were obtained, namely, more saturated, medium saturated and less saturated. Lipid and protein oxidation were measured by determining thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and free thiol content, respectively. Meat color measurement was performed using the Hunter L*, a*, b* system. The results showed that the less saturated group had higher oxidative stability in relation to lipid and protein oxidation than the more saturated and medium saturated groups, which might result from the balance between the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids and the vitamin E content. This was supported by the finding that the less saturated samples contained more unsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E than those in the more saturated and medium saturated groups. TBARS level was negatively related to free thiol content, indicating the presence of possible interactions between lipid and protein oxidation. Furthermore, a* values were found to be correlated to lipid and protein oxidation, suggesting likely interactions between these factors.

40|$|The {{catalytic}} partial oxidation (CPO) of hydrocarbons to synthesis gas, alkenes and oxygenates is {{an attractive}} route {{for the production of}} valuable chemicals. The formation of synthesis gas via methane CPO on Rh and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene on Pt have economic advantages in comparison to steam reforming. The challenge in performing CPO is to avoid the thermodynamically favored total <b>oxidation.</b> <b>Factors</b> influencing the selectivity and mechanistic detail are thus of great interest. CPO reactions are insufficiently described by surface reaction steps only; they may proceed via heterogeneous-homogeneous mechanisms, with coupling of surface and gas phase reactions by exchange of energy and reactive species. Radicals have been postulated as key intermediates [1]. Our goal is to identify reactive species in the catalyst-gas phase boundary layer. In order to sample and detect reactive species near the catalyst surface we have developed a novel type of Molecular Beam Mass Spectrometer (MBMS). Heterogeneous catalytic oxidations are performed under atmospheric pressure in a catalytic wall reactor (Rh-doped Pt tube, 4. 4 mm ID), which is placed in a high vacuum chamber. The molecules in the surface-gas phase boundary are continuously sampled through a small orifice (100 µm) in the reactor wall. Adiabatic expansion into the vacuum generates a supersonic beam, and reactive species like radicals can be quenched. A quadrupole MS (millisecond timescale) allows identifying the molecular beam constituents arising from the reaction zone by their mass numbers and their ionization- and appearance potentials. Methane CPO experiments reveal formation of ethane, consistent with coupling of methyl fragments. Variation of the flow conditions shifts the reaction zone along the reactor such that axial profiles can be obtained. Results obtained with a model gas mixture (CO/N 2) let us expect that ppm concentrations of radicals can be detected and discriminated from interfering ions of the same mass. [1] M. C.

At the same time, a continuous growth of native silicon oxide rich in arsenic was observed on the exposed surface, suggesting the presence of <b>oxidation</b> enhancing <b>factors</b> linked to the high arsenic concentration at the surface...|$|R

Complex phytotherapy (phytocomplex «Hepar») with its hepatoprotective and choleratic effects was prescribed for 33 patients with atherosclerosis and hepatobiliary dysfunction (in addition to dietotherapy and choleratics). Administration of the balanced phytotherapy resulted in significant reduction of the cholesterol level associated with the decrease of the C-reactive protein index in the blood. These changes were followed by decrease of the blood lipids and protein substrates <b>oxidation</b> - the <b>factors</b> meaning suppression {{of the degree of}} oxidative stress and of inflammation in the body. </span...|$|R
40|$|Rigorous {{control of}} {{substrate}} <b>oxidation</b> by humoral <b>factors</b> {{is essential for}} maintaining metabolic homeo-stasis. During feeding and fasting cycles, carbohy-drates and fatty acids are the two primary substrates in oxidative metabolism. Here, we report a novel role for the peptide hormone adropin in regulating substrate oxidation preferences. Plasma levels of adropin in-crease with feeding and decrease upon fasting. A comparison of whole-body substrate preference and skeletal muscle substrate oxidation in adropin knock-out and transgenic mice suggests adropin promotes carbohydrate oxidation over fat oxidation. In muscle, adropin activates pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which is rate limiting for glucose oxidation and sup-presses carnitine palmitoyltransferase- 1 B (CPT- 1 B) ...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of thermal}} barrier {{coatings}} (TBC's) in gas turbines {{has increased dramatically}} in recent years, due mainly {{to the need for}} component protection from ever increasing service temperatures. Oxidation of the bond coat has been identified as an important contributing factor to spallation of the ceramic top coat during service. Additional variables found to influence TBC thermal cycle life include bond coat coefficient of thermal expansion, creep behavior of both the ceramic and bond coat layers, and modulus of elasticity. The purpose of this work was to characterize the effects of oxidation on the stress states within the TBC system, as well as to examine the interaction of <b>oxidation</b> with other <b>factors</b> affecting TBC life...|$|R
40|$|We report here a new {{electrochemical}} method for the selective detection of ultratrace amount of arsenite (AsO 2 -, As 3 +) using a Prussian blue-modified screen-printed electrode (designated as PBSPE) by flow injection analysis (FIA) in 0. 1 M, pH 4 KCl/HCl carrier solution. The Prussian yellow/Prussian blue redox {{couple of the}} PBSPE was found to mediate the As 3 + <b>oxidation.</b> Various <b>factors</b> influencing the determination of As 3 + were thoroughly investigated in this study. Under the optimized FIA conditions, a linear calibration plot {{in the range of}} 50 nM- 300 muM with a detection limit (S/N = 3) of 25 nM (i. e., 64. 9 pg in 20 -muL loop) was observed at an operation potential of + 0. 6 V vs Ag/AgCl. The sensitivity was good enough to detect arsenite at levels lower than the current EPA standard. This modified electrode showed good resistance to interference from common ions, especially Cl-, which is generally considered as a major interference in the determination of As 3 + by ICPMS. The practical utility of the PBSPE to detect As 3 + was demonstrated in "blackfoot" disease endemic village groundwater from the southwestern coast area of Taiwan (Pei-Men) ...|$|R
40|$|Chitosan-stabilized {{nanoscale}} zero-valent iron (CS-nZVI) {{was prepared}} {{and used for}} the removal of acid fuchsine (AF) from aqueous solution with the assistance of ultrasound. More than 98. 9 % of AF was removed using CS-nZVI, aged CS-nZVI (exposed to air for 2 months), while only 14. 6 % removal efficiency was achieved after 15 min by chitosan alone with the assistance of ultrasound. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed that chitosan polymers were arranged in a homocentric layered structure. Thus, the polymer can prevent the aggregation of nZVI and increase their anti-oxidation capacity. X-ray diffraction (XRD) also suggested that the chitosan used in synthesis may protect nZVI nanoparticles from air <b>oxidation.</b> Different <b>factors</b> impacting on the removal of AF using CS-nZVI showed that the reduction increased when dosage and temperature increased, but decreased when pH and initial concentration rose. Kinetic studies revealed that the removal of AF fitted well to the pseudo-first-order model. The apparent activation energy was 55. 34 kJ/mol, indicating a chemically controlled reaction. Finally, the application of CS-nZVI in dyeing wastewater led to a removal efficiency of 99 % of AF, while the reuse test confirmed that AF's removal efficiency declined from 99. 6 to 39. 3 % after seven cycles...|$|R
40|$|Aging is a multifactorial process {{resulting}} in several functional and esthetic {{changes in the}} skin. Advances in research have yielded {{a tremendous amount of}} information on the molecular pathways involved in both intrinsic aging (natural) and extrinsic aging (including photoaging). Some of the characteristic features of aging skin, such as wrinkling, loss of elasticity, and atrophy, can largely be attributed to dermal changes. The amount of collagen in the skin decreases, while the cross linking increases, and the solubility of collagen is reduced. The role of fibroblasts in aging tissue has been most extensively studied in mammalian skin. The total number of fibroblasts decreases, and their metabolism shows characteristic alterations. The dermis is maintained in large part by fibroblasts, which secrete dermal collagens, elastin, and other extracellular matrix components. When the skin is wounded, fibroblasts secrete proteases to degrade the wounded matrix, and then synthesize new matrix. The fibroblasts also secrete growth factors to stimulate the keratinocytes to proliferate and close the wound and cytokines to attract macrophages to engulf and degrade debris. Stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) occurs after many different sublethal stresses including a number of <b>oxidation</b> <b>factors,</b> such as H 2 O 2, hyperoxia, or organic and lipid hydroperoxides. Fibroblast cells in replicative senescence share common features with cells in SIPS: morphology, senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity, cell cycle regulation, gene expression and telomere shortening. Most human cells lack sufficient telomerase to maintain telomeres, hence these genetic elements shorten with time and stress, contributing to aging and disease. We systematically examine the evidence supporting the use of dosage forms of non-hydrolized carnosine or carcinine in oral formulations for skin beautification purposes and provide a summary of the biomarkers of intrinsic and extrinsic skin aging, including photoaging. Senescence phenotype of human diploid fibroblasts is related with the exhaustion of their proliferative potential. This work suggests that different cell types, such as human skin fibroblasts, may use specific cellular treatment strategies with imidazole-containing dipeptides to halt the accelerated senescence of the fibroblast cells in response to telomere attrition and thus prevent skin aging through the number of biologically viable and safe metabolic pathways. The published data demonstrate that telomerase is expressed in the epidermis in situ independent of age. The reason for the sustained telomere length or expression of telomerase activity in the epidermis is associated not only with an increased turnover of keratinocytes, but also occurs {{due to the fact that}} the formation of a well structured epidermis strictly depends on a tight balance between proliferation and differentiation. Oral dosage forms of non-hydrolized carnosine or carcinine induce cellular responses in human skin fibroblasts through the telomere-mediated pathway and redox signaling, supporting the view that carnosine or related imidazole-containing dipeptide based compound-induced hormetic stimulation of cellular antioxidant defenses can be a useful approach toward anti-aging intervention to the skin...|$|R

In addition, reversible changes in the oxidation state of cobalt {{as a function of}} cycling CO and O 2 pressure (in the range of millitorr to 60 Torr) were quantified and compared. Turnover frequency reaction data was also obtained for the CoPt nanoparticles and correlated with the oxidation states and structures observed spectroscopically. These findings indicate that separated from the effect of partial pressure of the reactant gases, chemical state and structure changes of the CoPt nanoparticles during CO <b>oxidation</b> are important <b>factors</b> in determining the rate of the reaction...|$|R
40|$|Living {{conditions}} of every organism {{are influenced by}} various factors at this time. Some of them have positive effect on organism, some negative. Basic condition for surviving {{is the ability to}} resist and adapt to changing metabolic and living conditions. Every single stress effect can lead to changes in metabolism but organisms have ability to develope sufficient mechanisms for stress response. Some of them are similar for all living organisms (enzyme production, endogenous primary stress metabolites) some of them are specific for certain organism or stress type. Cell stress response can be observed on different levels (proteomic, genomic, metabolomic). In proper conditions it can be used indrustrially. In this work, influences of various stress factors were studied. These factors were applied on selected organisms – carotenogenic yeast and plant materials. Yeast stress response was induced by osmotic and <b>oxidation</b> stress <b>factors.</b> Changes on proteomic level and in production of selected secondary metabolites were observed. Proteome was analyzed by 1 D and 2 D electrophoresis with subsequent analysis of proteins by mass spectrometry. Yeast strain Rhodotorula glutinis CCY 20 - 2 - 26 showed the best adaptation to stress factors, which was moreover accompanied by overproduction of carotenoids. This finding can be premise for next industrial production of carotenoids. In plant samples predominantly enzymes and metabolites involved in antioxidant response were studied...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidation}} of Cr(Ill) to Cr(VI) {{represents a}} significant environmental hazard {{due to the}} much greater mobility and toxicity of Cr(VI). Despite the importance of Cr(Ill) <b>oxidation,</b> many <b>factors</b> influencing this chemical process in soils and waters remain unknown. In this study we investigate the sorption mechanisms of Al on birnessite and their effects on Cr(Ill) oxidation. Aluminum {{had no effect on}} Cr(III) oxidation at pH values less than 4. However, at pH values greater than 4 Al effectively limited Cr(Ill) oxidation. Reacting AI with birnessite prior to the introduction of Cr(Ill) resulted in less oxidation than when both AI and Cr(III) were reacted simultaneously with birnessite. Prior reaction of birnessite with AI at pH 5, and 2. 84 Ilmols Cr(III) initially present, decreased oxidation from 2. 80 to 0. 28 Ilmols Cr(VI). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed that an aluminum hydroxide surface precipitate formed on birnessite at pH ~ 4, thus accounting for the observed sorption and electrophoretic mobility trends and Cr(III) oxidation inhibition. The amorphous Al(OHh surface precipitate formed at an ion activity product 103 times lower than for precipitation in bulk solution. Subsequent to the Al Mn 02 reaction, introduction of Cr(III) resulted in a semicrystalline chromium hydroxide phase on the AI reacted birnessite. The resulting colloid was composed of three distinct metal-(hydr) oxides: o-Mn 02, Al(OHh-nH 20, and Cr(OHh-nH 20...|$|R
