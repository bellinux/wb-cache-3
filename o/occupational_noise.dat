5|$|There are two {{principal}} damage mechanisms {{to the inner}} ear in industrialised society, and both injure hair cells. The first is exposure to elevated sound levels (noise trauma), {{and the second is}} exposure to drugs and other substances (ototoxicity). A large number of people are exposed to sound levels on a daily basis that are likely to lead to significant hearing loss. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recently published research on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty (11%) and the percentage of those that can be attributed to <b>occupational</b> <b>noise</b> exposure (24%). Furthermore, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately twenty-two million (17%) US workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise. Workers exposed to hazardous noise further exacerbate the potential for developing noise-induced hearing loss when they do not wear hearing protection.|$|E

40|$|Despite various speech {{enhancement}} techniques {{have been developed}} for different applications, existing methods are limited in noisy environments with high ambient noise levels. Speech presence probability (SPP) estimation is a {{speech enhancement}} technique to reduce speech distortions, especially in low signal-to- noise ratios (SNRs) scenario. In this paper, we propose a new two-dimensional (2 D) Teager-energy operators (TEOs) improved SPP estimator for speech enhancement in time-frequency (T-F) domain. Wavelet packet transform (WPT) as a multiband decomposition technique is used to concentrate the energy distribution of speech components. A minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimator is obtained based on the generalized gamma distribution speech model in WPT domain. In addition, the speech samples corrupted by environment and <b>occupational</b> <b>noises</b> (i. e., machine shop, factory and station) at different input SNRs are used to validate the proposed algorithm. Results suggest that the proposed method achieves a significant enhancement on perceptual quality, compared with four conventional speech enhancement algorithms (i. e., MMSE- 84, MMSE- 04, Wiener- 96, and BTW) ...|$|R

40|$|Tumbling {{operators}} {{are exposed to}} loud <b>occupational</b> <b>noises</b> when loading and unloading the metal products in tumbling machines. The {{increase in the number}} of hearing loss injuries in the metal stamping industry initiated OSHA’s Special Emphasis Programs in designated industries and locations across the United States. Because occupational hearing loss injuries do not manifest themselves until years later, it is critical that employers install engineering controls immediately in order to protect worker’s hearing and prevent hearing loss injuries. Tumbling machines come in a variety of configurations. In addition to sound absorption material that can be installed on floors, ceilings, and walls, noise covers can also be custom-made and installed on tumbling machines. This study analyzed the effectiveness of custom-made tumbling noise covers in reducing the sound levels generated from the tumbling machines and reducing the operator’s noise exposures. Noise measurements and personal noise exposure were obtained prior to the installation of the noise cover and after the installation of the noise cover. The sound level and noise exposure results indicate that the noise cover is an effective control in reducing the sound levels produced by the tumbling machine and reducing noise exposures for the tumbling operators. Sound levels and operator’s noise exposures can be further reduced through the combination of machine configuration, hearing protection, use of absorption material to cover the walls, ceilings, and floors, enclosing the machines in a separate room, and the use of noise covers over the tumbling machines...|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) {{describes}} {{standards for}} <b>occupational</b> <b>noise</b> exposure in articles 1910.95 and 1926.52. OSHA states that an employer must implement hearing conservation programs for employees if {{the noise level}} of the workplace is equal to or above 85 dB(A) for an averaged eight-hour time period. OSHA also states that [...] "exposure to impulsive or impact noise should not exceed 140 dB peak sound pressure level". [...] The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends that all worker exposures to noise should be controlled below a level equivalent to 85 dBA for eight hours to minimize <b>occupational</b> <b>noise</b> induced hearing loss. NIOSH also recommends a 3 dBA exchange rate so that every increase by 3 dBA doubles {{the amount of the}} noise and halves the recommended amount of exposure time.The United States Department of Defense (DoD) instruction 605512 has some differences from OSHA 1910.95 standard, for example, OSHA 1910.95 uses a 5 dB exchange rate and DoD instruction 605512 uses a 3 dB exchange rate.|$|E
50|$|Chronic {{exposure}} to noise may cause noise-induced hearing loss. Older males exposed to significant <b>occupational</b> <b>noise</b> demonstrate more significantly reduced hearing sensitivity than their non-exposed peers, though differences in hearing sensitivity decrease with time and the two groups are indistinguishable by age 79. A comparison of Maaban tribesmen, who were insignificantly exposed to transportation or industrial noise, to a typical U.S. population showed that chronic {{exposure to}} moderately high levels of environmental noise contributes to hearing loss.|$|E
50|$|An Exposure Action Value (EAV) or Action Value (AV) is a {{limit set}} on <b>occupational</b> {{exposure}} to <b>noise</b> where, when those values are exceeded, employers must take steps to monitor the exposure levels.

When the eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA) reaches 85 dB(A), employers are required to administer a continuing, effective hearing conservation program. The program consists of monitoring, employee notification, observation, an audiometric testing program, hearing protectors, training programs, and record keeping requirements.|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study is to investigate the interactions between cigarette smoking and <b>occupational</b> exposure to <b>noise</b> as risk factors in the onset and development of hearing loss. The study was performed on a sample of 557 shipyard workers exposed to noise at an Equivalent Level (Leq) of 93 dBA. On the basis of their smoking habits, they were divided into three groups: group (A), non-smokers; group (B), smokers (15 - 30 cigarettes per day); and group (C), heavy smokers (over 30 cigarettes per day). The study focussed on the audiometric responses of the subjects at the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz. The results were then compared using statistical techniquees (Internal correlation coefficient, exponential model, ANCOVA, NPC test). Comparison of the audiometric responses showed statistically significant differences between the three groups. Non-parametric analysis, performed using the NPC test, highlighted that the interaction between smoking and exposure to noise has an influence on hearing loss at all frequencies, and particularly at high frequencies (3000 - 4000 Hz). The data obtained from the examined sample show that smoking and exposure to noise cause an increase in occupational hearing loss and that this is directly related to the number of cigarettes smoked...|$|R

50|$|About 22 {{million workers}} {{are exposed to}} {{hazardous}} noise, with additional millions exposed to solvents and metals that could put them {{at increased risk for}} hearing loss. Occupational hearing loss {{is one of the most}} common occupational diseases. 49% of male miners have hearing loss by the age of 50. By the age of 60, this number goes up to 70%. Construction workers also suffer an elevated risk. A screening program focused on construction workers employed at US Department of Energy facilities found 58% with significant abnormal hearing loss due to noise exposures at work. Occupational hearing loss is present in up to 33% of workers overall. <b>Occupational</b> exposure to <b>noise</b> causes 16% of adult disabling hearing loss worldwide.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of {{industrial}} equipment, the most common techniques for noise protection of workers consist of shock mounting source equipment, creation of acrylic glass or other solid barriers, and provision of ear protection equipment.

50|$|Industrial {{noise is}} often {{overlooked}} as an occupational hazard, {{as it is}} not visible to the eye. Overall, about 22 million workers in the United States are exposed to potentially damaging noise levels each year. Occupational hearing loss accounted for 14% of all occupational illnesses in 2007, with about 23,000 cases significant enough to cause permanent hearing impairment. About 82% of occupational hearing loss cases occurred to workers in the manufacturing sector. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration establishes <b>occupational</b> <b>noise</b> exposure standards.

50|$|Noise {{associated}} with aircraft does not only affect {{people on the}} ground, but also those within the aircraft (e.g., flight crew, cabin crew and passengers). While {{there appears to be}} little research in this area, lower noise inside the aircraft is widely promoted as a benefit for new aircraft. The noise levels inside an Airbus A321 during cruise have been reported as approximately 78 dB(A). During taxi when the aircraft engines are producing minimal thrust, noise levels in the cabin have been recorded at 65 dB(A). This is approximately 20 decibels louder than recommended acceptable levels for an office but 20 decibels below the <b>occupational</b> <b>noise</b> exposure limits of 85 dB(A).|$|E
50|$|In the US, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{provides}} recommendation on {{noise exposure}} in the workplace.

This publication set the recommended exposure limit (REL) of noise in an occupation setting to 85 dBA for 8 hours. However, in 1973 the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) maintained the requirement of an 8-hour average of 90 dBA. The following year, OSHA required employers to provide a hearing conservation program to workers exposed to 85 dBA average 8-hour workdays.|$|R

Interestingly, nucleolin has been shown to mediate the anti-apoptotic effect of HSP 70, a protein found to prevent ototoxicity and whose polymorphisms have been associated with susceptibility to NIHL. Increase in nucleolin expression has also been associated with the prevention of apoptosis in cells undergoing oxidative stress, a well-known metabolic sequela of noise exposure.
