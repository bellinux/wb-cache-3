5|$|Tropical Cyclone Trina (Fiji Meteorological Service designation: 01F, Joint Typhoon Warning Center designation: 06P) was a weak but {{destructive}} {{tropical cyclone}} in late 2001 which caused {{some of the}} worst flooding in the South Pacific island of Mangaia, Cook Islands, in nearly 50years. Forming out of an upper-level low pressure system on November29 near the island of Rarotonga, <b>or</b> <b>roughly</b> 1,470mi (2,365km) southeast of Fiji, Trina remained practically stationary as it meandered in the same general area for over a week. Due to unfavorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis, the storm struggled to develop significant convection, preventing it from intensifying beyond 65km/h (40mph). After finally succumbing to wind shear on December2, the system weakened to a tropical depression near Mangaia and dissipated several days later.|$|E
5|$|When {{collected}} in deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, the spores appear white. Viewed with a microscope, the spores are broadly elliptical <b>or</b> <b>roughly</b> spherical, smooth, thin-walled, and have dimensions of 6.5–9.5 by 5.5 by 8.5µm. Spores are amyloid (meaning they take up iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent) The basidia (spore-bearing cells {{on the edges of}} gills) are four-spored and measure 30–50 by 4–11µm. The bases of the basidia have clamp connections—short branches connecting one cell to the previous cell to allow passage of the products of nuclear division. The cap cuticle comprises a layer of densely interwoven, sightly gelatinized, filamentous hyphae that are 3–8µm in diameter. The stem tissue is made of sparse, thin, longitudinally oriented hyphae measuring 294 by 39µm.|$|E
5|$|An eyewall {{replacement}} {{cycle and}} weakening convection {{along the northern}} side resulted in steady weakening starting on July10. Increasing wind shear prevented the system from reorganizing as it neared East China. Early on July11, the typhoon reached the southwestern edge of the subtropical ridge and began turning {{to the north and}} later north-northeast. Chan-hom made landfall in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, <b>or</b> <b>roughly</b> 140km (80mi) south-southeast of Shanghai, around 08:40UTC. The JMA assessed the storm to have had winds of 140km/h (85mph) while the JTWC estimated one-minute sustained winds at 155km/h (100mph). Based on the JTWC estimate, Chan-hom was the strongest typhoon to pass within 160km (100mi) of Shanghai in at least 35years, and it was the strongest landfall in Zhejiang since recordkeeping began in 1949. Thereafter the storm accelerated north-northeast and moved over the cool waters of the Yellow Sea, prompting further degradation of its structure. Chan-hom weakened below typhoon-force around 18:00UTC on July11. The system's low-level center completely exposed on July12 as it approached the Korean Peninsula. Around 18:00UTC, Chan-hom moved ashore on the Ongjin peninsula in North Korea, southwest of the capital Pyongyang, with winds of 95km/h (60mph). By 00:00UTC on July13 the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while retaining gale-force winds, and six hours later the system dissipated over north-central North Korea.|$|E

5|$|Crucibulum {{species have}} light tan to cinnamon-colored fruiting bodies, {{known as a}} {{peridium}}, that are cup- or crucible-shaped. Depending on the species, {{the size of the}} peridium may range from 2–4tall by 1.5–3mm wide at the mouth (for C.parvulum) to 5–10mm tall by 5–8mm wide (for C.laeve). Viewed microscopically, the wall of the peridium is made of a single layer of tissue, in contrast to the three-layered peridium wall in Cyathus species. The outer surface of the peridium has hyphae that agglutinate so as to form a texture with visible filaments, a condition known as fibrillose; this outer layers of hairs typically wears off with age to leave a relatively smooth surface. Young specimens have a thin layer of tissue called an epiphragm that covers the top of the peridium; it wears off at maturity to expose the peridioles within. There are usually 4–6 peridioles (up to 15 have been noted for C.laeve) that are disc-shaped, whitish in color, and attached to the endoperidium by a strand called a funicular cord. Made of mycelia, The funicular cord tends to wither away and disappear as the fruiting body ages. Spores from Crucibulum species typically have an elliptical <b>or</b> <b>roughly</b> spherical shape, and are thick-walled, transclucent (hyaline) or light yellow-brown in color, with dimensions of 5–15 by 5–8µm. the spores of C.cyathiforme are notably slightly or strongly curved.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter {{is thought}} to consist of a dense core {{with a mixture of}} elements, a {{surrounding}} layer of liquid metallic hydrogen with some helium, and an outer layer predominantly of molecular hydrogen. Beyond this basic outline, there is still considerable uncertainty. The core is often described as rocky, but its detailed composition is unknown, as are the properties of materials at the temperatures and pressures of those depths (see below). In 1997, the existence of the core was suggested by gravitational measurements, indicating a mass of from 12 to 45 times that of Earth, <b>or</b> <b>roughly</b> 4%–14% of the total mass of Jupiter. The presence of a core during at least part of Jupiter's history is suggested by models of planetary formation that require the formation of a rocky or icy core massive enough to collect its bulk of hydrogen and helium from the protosolar nebula. Assuming it did exist, it may have shrunk as convection currents of hot liquid metallic hydrogen mixed with the molten core and carried its contents to higher levels in the planetary interior. A core may now be entirely absent, as gravitational measurements are not yet precise enough to rule that possibility out entirely.|$|E
5|$|Lacking any {{reserves}} and possessing only limited artillery support, the division's engineers prepared the bridges over the rivers for detonation. From 27 March onwards minor actions were fought {{along the line}} as the German advance began to reach the Australians. On 30 March a serious attempt at penetrating the line around Sailly-Laurette was held and broken up by the 11th Brigade, with German losses being assessed at around {{one and a half}} brigades, <b>or</b> <b>roughly</b> between 3 and 4,000 men. On 6 April further attempts were made and in the confusion the charges that had been placed on the Bouzencourt Bridge were fired and it was dropped into the Somme Canal. Nevertheless, the attempt was beaten off by the 10th Brigade. Following this the Australians were able to begin taking the initiative and throughout May they began to slowly recapture some of the ground that had been lost earlier as they undertook a series of peaceful penetration operations.|$|E

5|$|Owing to the {{aforementioned}} environmental conditions, the depression intensified to {{a tropical storm}} by 18:00UTC on October17; it was subsequently assigned the name Trudy by the NHC. Very deep convection blossomed over both the center and accompanying banding features. During the morning of October18, a central dense overcast became increasingly defined; microwave satellite imagery and coastal radars depicted {{the formation of a}} 12 to 17mi (19 to 27km) wide eye by 03:00UTC. It is estimated that Trudy reached its peak intensity around 09:15UTC on October18 with maximum sustained winds of 65mph (100km/h) and a barometric pressure of 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg). Simultaneously the storm made landfall just southeast of Marquelia, <b>or</b> <b>roughly</b> 70mi (110km) east of Acapulco. Interaction with the mountainous terrain of Mexico quickly took its toll on Trudy, with the system degrading to a tropical depression by 18:00UTC. The low-level circulation of the depression dissipated early on October19, with its mid-level remnants continuing northeastward over Mexico. The remnant system emerged over the Bay of Campeche on October20 and subsequently developed into Atlantic Tropical Depression Nine—which later became Tropical Storm Hanna—on October22. Due to the dissipation of its surface low, Trudy and Hanna are considered separate tropical cyclones by the NHC.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a Hubble {{successor}} materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which {{culminated in}} {{plans for the}} James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble. Very different from a scaled-up Hubble, {{it is designed to}} operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 Lagrangian point, where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened. It is not engineered to be fully serviceable (such as replaceable instruments), but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft. A main scientific goal of JWST is to observe the most distant objects in the universe, beyond the reach of existing instruments. It is expected to detect stars in the early Universe approximately 280 million years older than stars HST now detects. The telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency since 1996, and is planned for launch on an Ariane 5 rocket. Although JWST is primarily an infrared instrument, its coverage extends down to 600nm wavelength light, <b>or</b> <b>roughly</b> orange in the visible spectrum.
