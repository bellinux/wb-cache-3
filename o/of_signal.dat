5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss <b>of</b> <b>signal.</b> Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E
5|$|A feature {{coming into}} wide use in modern shortwave {{receivers}} is DSP technology, short for digital signal processing. DSP {{is the use}} of digital means to process signals, and a primary benefit in shortwave receivers is the ability to tailor the bandwidth of the receiver to current reception conditions and to the type <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> being listened to. A typical analog-only receiver may have a limited number of fixed bandwidths, or only one, but a DSP receiver may have 40 or more individually selectable filters.|$|E

5|$|In humans, this {{response}} is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on {{the surfaces of}} microbes. This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response. The speed of the response is a result <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> amplification that occurs after sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results {{in the production of}} peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.|$|E

5|$|Telecommunication and {{broadcast}} networks {{can be affected}} by volcanic ash in the following ways: attenuation and reduction <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> strength; damage to equipment; and overloading of network through user demand.

Research by the New Zealand-based Auckland Engineering Lifelines Group determined theoretically that impacts on telecommunications signals from ash would be limited to low frequency services such as satellite communication. Signal interference may also be caused by lightning, as this is frequently generated within volcanic eruption plumes.|$|E
5|$|The membrane-bound {{form of an}} {{antibody}} may {{be called}} a surface immunoglobulin (sIg) or a membrane immunoglobulin (mIg). It {{is part of the}} B cell receptor (BCR), which allows a B cell to detect when a specific antigen is present in the body and triggers B cell activation. The BCR is composed of surface-bound IgD or IgM antibodies and associated Ig-α and Ig-β heterodimers, which are capable <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> transduction. A typical human B cell will have 50,000 to 100,000 antibodies bound to its surface. Upon antigen binding, they cluster in large patches, which can exceed 1 micrometer in diameter, on lipid rafts that isolate the BCRs from most other cell signaling receptors.|$|E

Error in perception can create discreteness in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> produced, and so observed discreteness in nature may call for no more complicated explanation. Further developments in the theory <b>of</b> <b>signalling</b> may include a link with theories of aggression such as the sequential assessment game.

5|$|When animals choose mates, traits such as {{signalling}} {{are subject}} to evolutionary pressure. For example, the male gray tree frog, Hyla versicolor, produces a call to attract females. Once a female chooses a mate, this selects for a specific style of male calling, thus propagating a specific signalling ability. The signal can be the call itself, the intensity of a call, its variation style, its repetition rate, and so on. Various hypotheses seek to explain why females would select for one call over the other. The sensory exploitation hypothesis proposes that pre-existing preferences in female receivers can drive the evolution <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> innovation in male senders, {{in a similar way}} to the hidden preference hypothesis which proposes that successful calls are better able to match some 'hidden preference' in the female. Signallers have sometimes evolved multiple sexual ornaments, and receivers have sometimes evolved multiple trait preferences.|$|E

40|$|Most {{economic}} analyses presume {{that there are}} limited differences in the prior beliefs of individuals, an assumption most often justified by the argument that sufficient common ex-periences and observations will eliminate disagreements. We investigate this claim using a simple model of Bayesian learning. Two individuals with different priors observe the same infinite sequence <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> about some underlying parameter. Existing results in the literature establish that when individuals are certain about the interpretation <b>of</b> <b>signals,</b> under very mild conditions there will be asymptotic agreement–their assessments will eventually agree. In con-trast, we look at {{an environment in which}} individuals are uncertain about the interpretation <b>of</b> <b>signals,</b> meaning that they have non-degenerate probability distributions over the conditional distribution <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> given the underlying parameter. When priors on the parameter and the conditional distribution <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> have full support, we prove the following results: (1) Indi-viduals will never agree, even after observing the same infinite sequence <b>of</b> <b>signals.</b> (2) Before observing the signals, they believe with probability 1 that their posteriors about the underlying parameter will fail to converge.
