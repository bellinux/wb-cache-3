40|$|Perception <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> objects is <b>of</b> {{enormous}} {{importance in}} our lives. People have to perceive or understand novel objects when seeing an original painting, admiring an unconventional construction, and using an inventive device. However, {{very little is}} known about neural mechanisms underlying the perception for <b>novel</b> objects. Perception <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> objects relies on the integration of unusual features <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> objects in order to identify what such objects are. In the present study, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was employed to investigate neural correlates <b>of</b> perception <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> objects. The neuroimaging data on participants engaged in novel object viewing versus ordinary object viewing revealed that perception <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> objects involves significant activation in the left precuneus (Brodmann area 7) and the right visual cortex. The results suggest that the left precuneus is associated with the integration of unusual features <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> objects, while the right visual cortex is sensitive to the detection of such features. Our findings highlight the left precuneus as a crucial component of the neural circuitry underlying perception <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> objects...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this article}} we treat in some detail the problem of {{designing}} mechanisms {{that will allow us}} to deal with two types <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> language: (1) text requiring scheme learning; and (2) the understanding <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> metaphorical use <b>of</b> verbs. Schema learning is addressed by four types of processes: schema composition, secondary effect elevation, schema alteration, and volitionalization. The processing <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> metaphors depends on a decompositional analysis of verbs into “event shape diagrams,” along with a matching process that uses semantic marker-like information, to construct novel meaning structures. The examples we describe have been chosen to be types that occur commonly, so that rules that we need to understand them can also be used to understand a much wider range <b>of</b> <b>novel</b> language...|$|R

5|$|Authentic Science Fiction was a British {{science fiction}} {{magazine}} {{published in the}} 1950s that ran for 85 issues under three editors: Gordon Landsborough, H.J. Campbell, and E.C. Tubb. The magazine was published by Hamilton and Co., and began in 1951 as a series <b>of</b> <b>novels</b> appearing every two weeks; by the summer it became a monthly magazine, with readers' letters and an editorial page, though fiction content was still restricted to a single novel. In 1952 short fiction began to appear alongside the novels, and within two more years it completed the transformation into a science fiction magazine.|$|E
