Sulfuric acid-pretreated sucrose solution is polymerized and carbonized via adjusting the mass ratios of zeolite over sucrose and temperatures. Large surface area carbons with wide micropore size, developed mesoporosity and moderate storage capacity were obtained. We find that preparation parameters have great {{effects on the}} pore structure <b>of</b> <b>carbons.</b> Total pore volume <b>of</b> <b>carbons</b> develops with an increase of carbonization temperature {{and the presence of}} zeolite in carbonization processes can effectively enlarge the surface area and pore volume.

The hydrogen adsorption properties <b>of</b> <b>carbons</b> at 771 (and 20 bar are further investigated in this work. Carbon with a surface area of 1200 m(2) /g exhibits a hydrogen storage capacity of up to 3. 65 wt% at 77 K and 20 bar, and the hydrogen capacities at higher pressures are found to be much more correlated with surface area and micropore volume <b>of</b> <b>carbons.</b> (C) 2014 Elsevier B.

Micro structure <b>of</b> resin <b>carbon</b> was analyzed by XRD. Porosity, bulk density and true density <b>of</b> resin <b>carbon</b> was measured and calculated. The {{results show that the}} elastic modulus <b>of</b> resin <b>carbon</b> is 2. 51 GPa under 700 ℃ carbonized, and is 2. 92 GPa under 1300 ℃ carbonized. From 700 ℃ to 1300 ℃, the elastic modulus <b>of</b> the resin <b>carbon</b> increases firstly and then decreases. The XRD analysis shows the crystal structure <b>of</b> resin <b>carbon</b> tends to regularization with the increase of carbonization temperature.

40|$|This {{research}} is focused in {{the missing link}} between the specific surface area <b>of</b> <b>carbons</b> surface and their electrochemical capacitance. Current protocols used for the characterization <b>of</b> <b>carbons</b> applied in supercapacitors electrodes induce inconsistencies in {{the values of the}} interfacial capacitance (in F m− 2), which is hindering the optimization of supercapacitors. The constraints of both the physisorption of N 2 at 77 K and the standard methods used for the isotherm analysis frequently lead to a misleading picture of the porosity. Moreover, the specific surface area <b>of</b> <b>carbons</b> loses their meaning when the supercapacitor operates with organic electrolytes and ionic liquids and the actual surface involved in charge storage has to be assessed by molecular probes suiting the critical dimensions of the ions. In the case <b>of</b> certain <b>carbons</b> such as graphene type-materials, the voltage-driven mechanism may facilitate the access of electrolyte ions to spaces between carbon layers, providing a larger area than that estimated by gas adsorption. Finally, the morphological and porous features <b>of</b> <b>carbons</b> can be extremely modified when they are processed in electrodes. Due to their impact, all these issues should not be neglected and the characterization protocols must be adapted for this specific application <b>of</b> <b>carbons.</b> Financial support from EU 7 FP (Project Electrograph- 266391) is gratefully acknowledged.
