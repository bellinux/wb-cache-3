5|$|Great Britain has 19 {{operating}} reactors, producing about 20% of its electricity. It processes {{much of its}} {{spent fuel}} at Sellafield on the northwest coast across from Ireland, where nuclear waste is vitrified and sealed in stainless steel canisters for dry storage above ground for at least 50 years before eventual deep geologic disposal. Sellafield has a history <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> safety problems, including a fire in a nuclear plant in Windscale, and a significant incident in 2005 at the main reprocessing plant (THORP).|$|E
5|$|In the {{chromate}} conversion coating process, the strong oxidative properties of chromates are used to deposit a protective oxide layer on metals like aluminium, zinc and cadmium. This passivation and the self-healing properties by the chromate stored in the {{chromate conversion}} coating, which is able to migrate to local defects, are the benefits of this coating method. Because <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> health regulations on chromates, alternative coating methods are under development.|$|E

5|$|The {{stabilizing}} {{effect of}} cadmium chemicals like the carboxylates cadmium laurate and cadmium stearate on PVC {{led to an}} increased use of those compounds in the 1970s and 1980s. The demand for cadmium in pigments, coatings, stabilizers, and alloys declined as a result <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> health regulations in the 1980s and 1990s; in 2006, only 7% of to total cadmium consumption was used for plating, and only 10% was used for pigments.|$|E
5|$|Though {{evolution}} is not progressive, it does sometimes proceed in a linear way, reinforcing characteristics in certain lineages, but such examples are entirely {{consistent with the}} modern neo-Darwinian theory of evolution. These examples have sometimes {{been referred to as}} orthoselection but are not strictly orthogenetic, and simply appear as linear and constant changes because <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> molecular constraints on the direction of change. The term orthoselection was first used by Ludwig Hermann Plate, and was incorporated into the modern synthesis by Julian Huxley and Bernard Rensch.|$|E

5|$|Biogeographical {{patterns}} and range distributions are explained or predicted through {{knowledge of a}} species' traits and niche requirements. Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property, phenotype, or characteristic of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes {{play an important role}} in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits. Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting resource; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements. Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities. The habitat plus the niche is called the ecotope, which is defined as the full range <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> biological variables affecting an entire species.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, a {{delegation}} from Dade County prompted the Florida State Legislature {{to support the}} development of a state Marine Laboratory in conjunction with the UM lab. It reported to the State Board of Conservation, which had no marine research facility and little budget of its own at the time. The relationship lasted for 12 years until the state of Florida built the board a lab in St. Petersburg. In 1953, the School's classrooms and laboratories were built at the current Virginia Key location. It was renamed the Institute of Marine Science in 1961, it became part of the University of Miami's School <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>and</b> Planetary Sciences.|$|E
5|$|This event {{creating}} a sustainable and reliable {{relationship with the}} general public is {{a significant part of}} THSRC’s corporate vision and an important foundation <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> social sustainability. Therefore, it will continue making efforts to establish a good partnership with the general public {{as well as with the}} stakeholders, customers, employees, suppliers, communities and the government. To create greater value for each of these parties, it will move forward with its philosophy of “Go Extra Mile” to improve their lives through the provision of environmentally friendly high-speed rail services, which play a central role in connecting the entire western corridor of Taiwan. Since operation in 2007, THSRC has been dedicated to CSR initiatives, emphasizing environmental protection and giving support to all members of the communities served by THSRC. THSRC also published the first CSR Report in 2009, which gave all stakeholders a better understanding of its CSR objectives and activities, and in 2011, we received the 20th Annual Enterprises Environmental Protection Award, sponsored by the Environmental Protection Administration of Taiwan.|$|E

5|$|The {{industry}} {{has come under}} threat, both from {{a decline in the}} number of ships scrapped annually – down from 70–80 to about 20 – and because <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> work safety concerns. There have been complaints that journalists and human rights activists are being barred from the ship breaking yards. The ship breaking industry is purportedly damaging the local ecology as well, taking a toll on the fish population and soil quality. A survey conducted by students of the Institute of Marine Science of Chittagong University in 2007 revealed that the soil of the locality is polluted by heavy metals including mercury (0.5 to 2.7ppm), lead (0.5 to 21.8ppm), chromium (220ppm), cadmium (0.3 to 2.9ppm), iron (2.6 to 5.6ppm), calcium (5.2 to 23.2ppm) and magnesium (6.5 to 10.57ppm). Safety standards in the industry are low; between 1995 and 2005, 150 workers were killed and 576 were maimed or injured. The main causes of death were fire or explosion, suffocation and inhaling CO2. These old ships also contain hazardous substances like asbestos, lead paint, heavy metals and PCBs. The workers are paid US$1.75 a day and have little access to medical treatment. Among the workers, 41% of are aged between 18 and 22 years, and many are reported to be as young as 10 years of age. There have also been allegations of large quantities of steel and non-ferrous items, such as bronze, aluminum, copper, and bronze-amalgam recovered from ship breaking being smuggled out of Bangladesh. There also are reports of pirates targeting tugboats pulling ships in.|$|E
