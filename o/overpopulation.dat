5|$|Birth {{control is}} also being {{considered}} {{as an alternative to}} hunting as a means of controlling <b>overpopulation</b> in wild animals. Contraceptive vaccines {{have been found to be}} effective in a number of different animal populations. Kenyan goat herders fix a skirt, called an olor, to male goats to prevent them from impregnating female goats.|$|E
5|$|Hunting is {{permitted}} {{in most of}} Black Moshannon State Park. It helps to prevent an <b>overpopulation</b> of animals and the resulting overbrowsing of the understory. The most common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrel, wild turkey, and white-tailed deer. However, the hunting of groundhogs is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Impact on hunting: Semiautomatic rifles {{have been}} purposefully used for {{hunting in the}} Czech Republic since at least 1946 and they are {{especially}} effective and popular in curbing wild boar <b>overpopulation</b> {{that is responsible for}} large number of car accidents as well as damage to agriculture. Banning of these firearms would likely lead to increase of car accidents due to collisions with wild animals and consequent increase in number of injuries and fatalities.|$|E
5|$|In recent times, {{the focus}} has been on {{creating}} an awareness of the threat to the Earth's ecosystems from human <b>overpopulation</b> and its consequent need for biological and physical resources. Botanical gardens provide an excellent medium for communication between the world of botanical science and the general public. Education programs can help the public develop greater environmental awareness by understanding the meaning and importance of ideas like conservation and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{debate about}} America {{remained}} mostly theoretical before the 19th century, since very few Swedes had any personal {{experience of the}} nation. Emigration was illegal and population {{was seen as the}} wealth of nations. However, the Swedish population doubled between 1750 and 1850, and as population growth outstripped economic development, it gave rise to fears of <b>overpopulation</b> based on the influential population theory of Thomas Malthus. In the 1830s, the laws against emigration were repealed.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} cause of {{collapse}} at Tikal is <b>overpopulation</b> and agrarian failure. The fall of Tikal was {{a blow to}} the heart of Classic Maya civilization, the city having {{been at the forefront of}} courtly life, art and architecture for over a thousand years, with an ancient ruling dynasty. However, new research regarding paleoenvironmental proxies from the Tikal reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of Tikal.|$|E
5|$|Chacoan flora typifies that of North American high deserts: {{sagebrush}} {{and several}} species of cactus are interspersed with dry scrub forests of piñon and juniper, the latter primarily on the mesa tops. The canyon is far drier than other parts of New Mexico located at similar latitudes and elevations, and it lacks the temperate coniferous forests plentiful to the east. The prevailing sparseness of plants and wildlife was echoed in ancient times, when <b>overpopulation,</b> expanding cultivation, overhunting, habitat destruction, and drought may have led the Chacoans to strip the canyon of wild plants and game. It {{has been suggested that}} even during wet periods the canyon was able to sustain only 2,000 people.|$|E
5|$|During the 9th century AD, {{the central}} Maya region {{suffered}} major political collapse, {{marked by the}} abandonment of cities, the ending of dynasties, and a northward shift in activity. No universally accepted theory explains this collapse, but it likely had a combination of causes, including endemic internecine warfare, <b>overpopulation</b> resulting in severe environmental degradation, and drought. During this period, known as the Terminal Classic, the northern cities of Chichen Itza and Uxmal showed increased activity. Major cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula continued to be inhabited long after the cities of the southern lowlands ceased to raise monuments.|$|E
5|$|In 1510, a Portuguese fleet under Afonso de Albuquerque, sent by King Manuel I of Portugal, wrested {{the region}} of Goa from Sultan Yusuf Adil Shah of Bijapur. In 1534, the Diocese of Goa was established. Soon missionaries were sent to Goa, which led to {{conversion}} of a sizeable population to Roman Catholicism. The bulk of Christian settlers came in three major migration waves towards South Canara. These migrations occurred in periods of great unrest: the Goa Inquisition occurred from 1560 onwards; the Portuguese–Adil Shahi wars were between 1570–79; and the Portuguese–Maratha wars occurred between 1667–83 and 1737–40. Other factors that led to mass migrations were disease epidemics, famines, natural calamities, <b>overpopulation,</b> poor living conditions, heavy tax burdens, and social discrimination by the Portuguese.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by {{concerns}} about <b>overpopulation,</b> the counterculture of the 1960s and the societal effects of television, the play depicts {{a world of}} the future where a small elite control the media, keeping the lower classes docile by serving them an endless diet of lowest common denominator programmes and pornography. The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers have for a new programme which will follow the trials and tribulations {{of a group of}} people left to fend for themselves on a remote island. In this respect, the play is often cited as having anticipated the craze for reality television.|$|E
5|$|Malawi {{is among}} the world's least-developed countries. The economy is heavily based in agriculture, with a largely rural population. The Malawian {{government}} depends heavily on outside aid to meet development needs, although this need (and the aid offered) has decreased since 2000. The Malawian government faces challenges in building and expanding the economy, improving education, healthcare, environmental protection, and becoming financially independent amidst widespread <b>overpopulation</b> and unemployment. Since 2005, Malawi has developed several programs that focus on these issues, and the country's outlook appears to be improving, with {{a rise in the}} economy, education and healthcare seen in 2007 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|Many Western Catholics and non-Catholics have voiced {{disagreement}} on the Church's support for natural family planning, and contend {{it contributes to}} <b>overpopulation</b> and poverty. The Church's rejection of condom use is widely criticized, in particular with regard to countries where the incidence of AIDS and HIV has reached epidemic proportions. In its defense, Catholics cite countries such as Kenya and Uganda, where behavioral changes are encouraged instead of condom use, and where greater progress in controlling the disease has been made than in countries that promote condom use alone.|$|E
5|$|Salford {{became a}} major factory town and inland port during the 18th and 19th centuries. Cotton and silk {{spinning}} and weaving in local mills attracted an influx of families and provided Salford with a strong economy. Salford Docks was a principal dockyard of the Manchester Ship Canal. By {{the end of the}} 19th century Salford had an enlarged working class community and suffered from chronic <b>overpopulation.</b> Industrial activities declined during the 20th century however, causing a local economic depression. Salford subsequently became one of contrasts, with regenerated inner-city areas like Salford Quays next {{to some of the most}} socially deprived and violent areas in England.|$|E
5|$|Smith invented Sartorias-deles as {{a fantasy}} world that {{gradually}} became populated by humans {{over a number}} of centuries; these new arrivals were influenced by the world's indigenous beings enough to better themselves, largely eradicating societal problems like disease and <b>overpopulation.</b> She originally wrote Crown Duel as a twenty-year-old, and when she returned to rewrite the story later in life, she sought to maintain the story from Mel's young perspective. As a result, the novel's intended audience are young adults. As Smith's most popular YA novel, both parts of Crown Duel received generally positive reviews. Reviews of the 1997 publication of Crown Duel highlight the character of Mel and Smith's worldbuilding as positive elements. Critics assessed Court Duel as generally the lesser of the two.|$|E
5|$|The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT) is an {{environmental}} movement {{that calls for}} all people to abstain from reproduction to cause the gradual voluntary extinction of humankind. VHEMT supports human extinction primarily because, in the group's view, it would prevent environmental degradation. The group states that {{a decrease in the}} human population would prevent a significant amount of human-caused suffering. The extinctions of non-human species and the scarcity of resources required by humans are frequently cited by the group as evidence of the harm caused by human <b>overpopulation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement {{was founded}} by Les U. Knight, a high school {{substitute}} teacher who lives in Portland, Oregon. After becoming involved in the environmental movement {{as a college student}} in the 1970s, Knight attributed most of the dangers faced by the planet to human <b>overpopulation.</b> He joined the Zero Population Growth organization, and chose to be vasectomised at age 25. He later concluded that the extinction of humanity would be the best solution to the Earth's environmental problems. He believes that this idea has also been held by some people throughout human history.|$|E
5|$|To prevent <b>overpopulation</b> and inbreeding, and {{to protect}} their habitat from being overgrazed, the horses are managed by the National Park Service, the state of North Carolina, and several private organizations. The horses are {{monitored}} for diseases, such as equine infectious anemia, an outbreak of which was discovered and subsequently eliminated on Shackleford in 1996. They are safeguarded from traffic on North Carolina Highway 12. Island populations are limited by adoptions and by birth control. Bankers taken from the wild and trained {{have been used for}} trail riding, driving, and occasionally for mounted patrols.|$|E
5|$|Economic growth {{began to}} falter {{at the end}} of the 13th century, owing to a {{combination}} of <b>overpopulation,</b> land shortages and depleted soils. The Great Famine shook the English economy severely and population growth ceased; the first outbreak of the Black Death in 1348 then killed around half the English population. The agricultural sector shrank rapidly, with higher wages, lower prices and diminishing profits leading to the final demise of the old demesne system and the advent of the modern farming system centring on the charging of cash rents for lands. As returns on land fell, many estates, and in some cases entire settlements, were simply abandoned, and nearly 1,500 villages were deserted during this period. A new class of gentry emerged who rented farms from the major nobility. Unsuccessful government attempts were made to regulate wages and consumption, but these largely collapsed in the decades following the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.|$|E
5|$|The {{visual effects}} for Doomsday {{stemmed from the}} 1980s stunt-based films, {{involving}} approximately 275 visual effects shots. While filmmakers did not seek innovative visual effects, they worked with budget restrictions by creating set extensions. With most shots taking place in daylight, the extensions involved matte paint and 2D and 3D solutions. The visual effects crew visited Scotland to take reference photos so scenes that were filmed in Cape Town, South Africa could instead have Scottish backgrounds. Several challenges for the visual effects crew included the illustration of cow <b>overpopulation</b> in line with a decimated human population and the convincing creation of the rebuilt Hadrian Wall in different lights and from different distances. The most challenging visual effects shot in Doomsday was the close-up in which a main character is burned alive. The shot required multiple enhancements and implementations of burning wardrobe, burning pigskin, and smoke and fire elements to look authentic.|$|E
5|$|The story {{focuses on}} the {{activities}} of the three species {{in a part of the}} Milky Way known as the Koprulu Sector. Millennia before any of the events of the games, a species known as the Xel'Naga genetically engineer the Protoss and later the Zerg in attempts to create pure beings. These experiments backfire and the Xel'Naga are largely destroyed by the Zerg. Centuries before the beginning of StarCraft in 2499, the hardline international government of Earth, the United Earth Directorate (UED), commissions a colonization program as part of a solution to <b>overpopulation,</b> however the computers automating the colony ships malfunction, propelling the Terran colonists far off course to the edge of Protoss space. Out of contact with Earth, they form various factions to maintain their interests. Intrigued by the behavior and mentality of the Terrans, the Protoss remain hidden to examine the humans, while protecting them from other threats without their knowledge. The Zerg, however, target the Terrans for assimilation to harness their psionic potential, forcing the Protoss to destroy tainted Terran colonies to contain the Zerg infestation.|$|E
5|$|Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat was {{the next}} ruler, 16th in the dynasty founded by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', {{although}} he appears {{not to have been}} a direct descendent of his predecessor. He took the throne in June763 and may have been only 9years old. He produced no monumental stelae and instead dedicated hieroglyphic texts incorporated into the city's architecture and smaller altars. Texts make an obscure reference to his father but his mother was a noblewoman from distant Palenque in Mexico. He built the platform of Temple11 over the tomb of the previous king in AD769 and added a two-storey superstructure that was finished in AD773. Around AD776, he completed the final version of Temple16 over the tomb of the founder. At the base of the temple, he placed the famous AltarQ, which shows each of the 16rulers of the city from K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' through to Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat, with a hieroglyphic text on top describing the founding of the dynasty. By the latter 8thcentury, the nobility had become more powerful, raising palaces with hieroglyphic benches that were as richly constructed as those of the king. At the same time, local satellites were displaying their own local power, as demonstrated by the ruler of Los Higos erecting his own stela in AD781. Towards the end of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat's reign, the city of Copán was struggling with <b>overpopulation</b> and a lack of local resources, with a distinct fall in living standards among the populace. Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat was able to celebrate his second K'atun in AD802 with his own monument, but the king's participation in the K'atun ending ceremony of AD810 was marked at Quiriguá, not at Copán. By this time the city's population was over 20,000 and it had long needed to import basic necessities from outside.|$|E
25|$|Some {{controversy}} surrounds this ideology, {{with some}} citing world <b>overpopulation</b> and the eventual depletion of essential natural resources. However, {{the notion of}} <b>overpopulation</b> as a threat is itself a matter of dispute.|$|E
25|$|Uncontrolled human {{population}} growth leading to <b>overpopulation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Controversy {{about life}} {{extension}} {{is due to}} fear of <b>overpopulation</b> and possible effects on society. Biogerontologist Aubrey De Grey counters the <b>overpopulation</b> critique {{by pointing out that}} the therapy could postpone or eliminate menopause, allowing women to space out their pregnancies over more years and thus decreasing the yearly population growth rate. Moreover, the philosopher and futurist Max More argues that, given the fact the worldwide population growth rate is slowing down and is projected to eventually stabilize and begin falling, superlongevity would be unlikely to contribute to <b>overpopulation.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{postulated}} Younger Dryas impact event, {{claimed to}} be in part responsible for megafauna extinction and ending the last glacial period, could have provided circumstances that required the evolution of agricultural societies for humanity to survive. The agrarian revolution itself {{is a reflection of}} typical <b>overpopulation</b> by certain species following initial events during extinction eras; this <b>overpopulation</b> itself ultimately propagates the extinction event.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} for space colonization is {{to mitigate the}} negative effects of <b>overpopulation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Any live {{cell with}} more than three live {{neighbours}} dies, as if by <b>overpopulation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Israel is the thirty-fourth most-densely crowded {{country in}} the world. In an {{academic}} article, Jewish National Fund Board member Daniel Orenstein, argues that, as elsewhere, <b>overpopulation</b> is a stressor on the environment in Israel; he shows that environmentalists have conspicuously failed to consider the impact of population {{on the environment and}} argues that <b>overpopulation</b> in Israel has not been appropriately addressed for ideological reasons.|$|E
25|$|Seen as {{a relief}} {{to the problem of}} <b>overpopulation</b> even as early as 1758, and listed as one of Stephen Hawking's reasons for {{pursuing}} space exploration, it has become apparent that space colonisation in response to <b>overpopulation</b> is unwarranted. Indeed, the birth rates of many developed countries, specifically spacefaring ones, are at or below replacement rates, thus negating the need to use colonisation as a means of population control.|$|E
25|$|<b>Overpopulation</b> may {{indicate}} any {{case in which}} the population of any species of animal may exceed the carrying capacity of its ecological niche.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Catholic Church {{maintains}} {{its opposition to}} birth control. Some Roman Catholic Church members and non-members criticize this belief as contributing to <b>overpopulation,</b> and poverty.|$|E
25|$|India {{is faced}} with huge {{challenges}} to manage its vast population reserve and correctly transition from the burden of <b>overpopulation</b> to empowering Indians to drive domestic growth.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{butterflies}} and moths migrate to escape from potentially harmful circumstances. Examples of this are a shortage of proper food plants, an unfavorable climate, like cold or extreme rain or <b>overpopulation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Others, however, do {{not believe}} <b>overpopulation</b> {{to be a problem}} in itself; {{regarding}} such problems as overcrowding, global warming, and straining food supplies to be problems of public policy and/or technology.|$|E
25|$|The first Director-General of UNESCO, Julian Huxley, {{wrote of}} The crowded world in his Evolutionary Humanism (1964), {{calling for a}} world {{population}} policy. Huxley openly criticised communist and Roman Catholic attitudes to birth control, population control and <b>overpopulation.</b>|$|E
