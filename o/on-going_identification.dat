5000|$|Because of the {{extensive}} contamination, and its <b>on-going</b> <b>identification</b> as the cleanup proceeded, the NPS has made numerous predictions about the end-date for cleanup and remediation of the areas. For example, in July 2011 {{it was predicted that}} the Krejci dump site would be {{in the final stages of}} revegetation in the spring of 2012. But it wasn't until August 2012 that the NPS declared [...] "comprehensive post-excavation soil sampling effort establishes that remediation goals for the 46-acre former dump site have been met," [...] and, [...] "The final steps necessary to restore the Site may now begin, including final grading; re-vegetation using native meadow grasses, forbs and shrubs; and restoration of 3 acres of wetland and wet meadow habitats." [...] The Ohio Division of Environmental Response and Revitalization (DERR) also had a projected end-date of sometime in 2012.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} ethnographically that history is a particularly important and celebrated aspect of Icelandic identity. Paraphrasing Hastrup, {{it could be argued}} that Icelandic culture is a culture of the past. The collapse in Iceland in 2008 problematised this valorisation of history. In this paper we draw on Carrithers’ ideas of cultural rhetoric to analyse how Icelanders made sense of the collapse particularly in relation to their understanding of their own history. Following Johnson, we look at the play of agency, intention and responsibility evident in the accounts offered for the collapse. Through that we seek to highlight how these accounts, even when highly critical of Icelandic political and cultural practices, tend to allow for and even encourage the <b>on-going</b> <b>identification</b> with the nation-form.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the relationship between anthropometric and fitness skills in youth soccer players according to their related age. The existence of relative age effect was also examined. Anthropometric as well fitness variables such as height, weight, BMI, body mass, flexibility, balance, reaction time, jumping ability, and endurance of the lower limb were assessed in 347 amateur young players. Participants’ age ranged from 9 to 16 (M= 12. 43, SD= 2. 17). Analyses of variance indicated many significant differences among players of different birth quartile (from P<. 001 to P<. 05) for all the skills that were examined. The chi square test that was conducted to assess the distribution of players, showed that for all four different age groups no statistically significant difference was found regarding the birth quartile of players. In countries that training groups include 2 different age categories, anthropometric and fitness differences because of relative age effect are heightened. However, physical and physiological variables are inaccurate in predicting later success of players. Thus talent identification systems should provide equal opportunities for talented but related younger players. It is suggested an <b>on-going</b> talent <b>identification</b> using a multidimensional evaluation form including technical, physiological, physical, tactical, and psychological parameters...|$|R
40|$|PTSD is {{considered}} the most common negative psychological reactions among survivors following an earthquake. The present study sought {{to find out the}} determinants of PTSD in earthquake survivors using a systematic meta-analysis. Four electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycInfo) were used to search for observational studies about PTSD following earthquakes. The literature search, study selection, and data extraction were conducted independently by two authors. 52 articles were included in the study. Summary estimates, subgroup analysis, and publication bias tests were performed on the data. The prevalence of PTSD after earthquakes ranged from 4. 10 % to 67. 07 % in adults and from 2. 50 % to 60. 00 % in children. For adults, the significant predictors were being female, low education level or socio-economic status, prior trauma; being trapped, experiencing fear, injury, or bereavement during the disaster. For children, the significant predictors were being older age, high education level; being trapped, experiencing fear, injury, or bereavement, witnessing injury/death during the earthquakes. Our study provides implications for the understanding of risk factors for PTSD among earthquake survivors. Post-disaster mental health recovery programs that include early <b>identification,</b> <b>on-going</b> monitoring, and sustained psychosocial support are needed for earthquake survivors...|$|R
40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2015. Banking is the most lucrative business and thus should provide the best services to the clients to maintain its welfare. More importantly, since this sector is highly customer oriented, {{the only way it}} can achieve its goal is by satisfying the customers by providing quality, effective and efficient services. I got the privilege to work as an intern in Citibank, N. A., Dhaka (Gulshan branch) for 3 months. The topic that I have focused in my report is on “The Growing Concern of Customer Due Diligence In Line With Citibank N. A” which they practice all throughout Bangladesh. I worked under Securities and Fund Services department. In my report, I have focused on know your customer procedure, key elements of customer due diligence, benefits of customer due diligence, purpose of customer due diligence and enhanced due diligence (EDD). The key elements of KYC program have four elements such as customer acceptance policy, customer <b>identification,</b> <b>on-going</b> monitoring of high risk accounts and identification of suspicious accounts. I have also made some recommendation in line with FATF recommendations. This real picture of the bank which I was able to observe through my eyes during my internship period has contributed greatly in preparing this report. I also gathered practical experience during this period which also helped me in preparing this report accurately...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We discuss deep {{surveys in}} the submm regime using the SCUBA {{bolometer}} array on the JCMT. At 850 µm SCUBA has resolved {{the bulk of}} the submm background (SMBR) detected by COBE into discrete sources brighter than 0. 5 mJy. The <b>on-going</b> <b>identification</b> and characterisation of this population at other wavelengths suggests that {{the bulk of the}} submm sources brighter than ∼ 1 mJy lie at z> ∼ 1, with a median redshift for the population of ∼ 2 – 3. The optical/nearinfrared properties of the counterparts to the submm sources breakdown as follows: roughly two-thirds have reliable identifications with the others being more ambiguous. Of those with identifications about half are optically bright (I ∼ 25) including both blank fields and Extremely Red Objects (EROs). We conclude that a population of distant, highly obscured ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) dominates the SMBR. The wide range in the characteristics of the optical counterparts is consistent with the dispersion in the restframe UV properties of local ULIRGs. We suggest that the faint submm population comprises a class of high redshift dusty, mergers associated with the formation of present day luminous elliptical galaxies. 1 2 Smail et al. 1...|$|E
