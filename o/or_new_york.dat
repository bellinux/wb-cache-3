5|$|During the Mexican oil boom, Air France flew Concorde twice weekly to Mexico City's Benito Juárez International Airport via Washington, DC, <b>or</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City, from September 1978 to November 1982. The {{worldwide}} {{economic crisis}} {{during that period}} resulted in this route's cancellation; the last flights were almost empty. The routing between Washington <b>or</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and Mexico City included a deceleration, from Mach 2.02 to Mach 0.95, to cross Florida subsonically and avoid creating a sonic boom over the state; Concorde then re-accelerated back to high speed while crossing the Gulf of Mexico. On 1 April 1989, on an around-the-world luxury tour charter, British Airways implemented changes to this routing that allowed G-BOAF to maintain Mach 2.02 by passing around Florida {{to the east and}} south. Periodically Concorde visited the region on similar chartered flights to Mexico City and Acapulco.|$|E

5|$|Subway Series {{is a term}} {{applied to}} any series of {{baseball}} games between New York City teams, as opposing teams can travel to compete merely by using the subway system. Subway Series is a term long used in New York, going back to series between the Brooklyn Dodgers <b>or</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Giants and the New York Yankees in the 1940s and 1950s. Today, the term is {{used to describe the}} rivalry between the Yankees and the New York Mets. During the 2000 World Series, cars on the 4 train (which stopped at Yankee Stadium) were painted with Yankee colors, while cars on the 7 train (which stopped at Shea Stadium) had Mets colors. The term could also be applied to the rivalry between the New York Knicks and the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association, or the New York Rangers and the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League ever since the Nets and the Islanders moved to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.|$|E

Meanwhile, Jim Thorpe of the Canton Bulldogs was named the APFA's first president but continued to play for the team.|$|E

25|$|The Whalers were {{hampered}} by numerous off-ice factors. Hartford was the smallest American {{market in the}} NHL and was located on the traditional dividing line between the home territories for Boston and the two New York area teams, the Rangers and Islanders. This limited the team's marketability. Additionally, {{for most of the}} Whalers' tenure as an NHL team, the Hartford Civic Center was one of the smallest arenas in the league. At its maximum, it seated just 15,635 for hockey. The team averaged over 14,000 fans only twice in its 15 years at the Civic Center. They averaged only 13,867 from 1980 to 1997.
