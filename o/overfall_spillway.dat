50|$|The Glenmaggie Dam wall, {{which creates}} the Glenmaggie Lake, is a mass {{concrete}} overfall dam with irrigation outlets {{on both sides}} of the river serving irrigation channels. The central portion is an <b>overfall</b> <b>spillway.</b> The dam wall was raised in 1958 by the addition of gates; stabilised using ground anchors in 1989; and upgraded in 2003 to enable it to withstand overtopping.|$|E

The dam's concrete <b>overfall</b> <b>spillway</b> has a discharge capacity of , [...] of which is via the dam's two 5 ft by 7 ft sluice gates located {{near the bottom of}} the dam. Ocoee Reservoir No. 3 has 360 acre of water surface and 24 mi of shoreline. [...] Major recreational releases are typically scheduled for weekends during the summer months.|$|E
50|$|The dam is 3,700 feet long, mainly an earthen {{structure}} with a concrete core wall. At the creek channel there are gate chambers and a spillway 400 feet long. The masonry contents of this dam are 110,020 cubic yards, while the embankment amounts to 611,200 cubic yards. The maximum height of masonry above rock is 82 {{feet and the}} <b>overfall</b> at the <b>spillway,</b> 61 feet. The area of the reservoir at crest level is 4.46 square miles, its maximum depth is 75 feet and average depth of 28 feet. The reservoirs capacity is 3,445,000,000 cubic feet.|$|R
50|$|No {{constricted}} gorge, where a short dam {{might be}} built, was {{available on the}} site of this reservoir. The dam has a total length of 3,700 feet, of which there is a 400-foot masonry section, embodying gate chambers and spillway. The major, or earthen, portion of the dam has a concrete core wall running through most of its length. The masonry content of the dam is 110,020 cubic yards, while there are 611,200 cubic yards of embankment in the earthen section. The masonry has a maximum height of 82 feet above rock and the <b>overfall</b> at the <b>spillway</b> is 61 feet. The maximum height of the earthen dam is 56 feet above the natural surface.|$|R
40|$|Susu Dam is an RCC Dam under {{construction}} in Peninsula Malaysia. The dam design {{has been carried out}} by SMEC International in its offices in Kuala Lumpur. The dam is some 90 m tall. The <b>overfall</b> stepped <b>spillway</b> provides for discharges to enter a hydraulic jump stilling basin for energy dissipation, prior to passing through a culvert under a roadway. The spillway was subject to hydraulic model testing at the Utah Water Research Laboratory of Utah State University (USA), at a length scale of 1 : 30. The hydraulic performance of the spillway design was evaluated up to the 4, 700 m 3 /s Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) discharge (almost 1, 000 L/s model scale). The spillway was tested through a number of configurations, prior {{to the development of the}} final arrangement. The purpose of the paper is to describe the modelling detail, and then focus on the flow behaviour at the stair-stepped spillway chute with 2. 4 m high steps, in particular the piezometric pressures and transient pressures on the tread and riser of the steps. The spillway chute converged from ~ 100 m at the crest to 78 m at the bottom at entrance to the stilling basin; the unit discharge entering the stilling basin was ~ 60 m 2 /s for the PMF. Of particular interest was the occurrence of negative pressures on the steps, and the paper will describe the transients for several discharges from the AEP 1 in 1, 000 up to the PMF; the results indicating very low pressures into a cavitation region. The design provides for an aerator across the spillway in order to counter the effects of possible cavitation. Results will be presented with and without the aerator operating. The paper provides useful design information for the hydraulic design of stepped spillways...|$|R
