The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink, ruby, and <b>odd-eyed</b> (two different-colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown. Ruby refers to eyes which at a glance appear black but which are on closer observation a deep, dark red.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Odd-eyed</b> {{cats are}} popular within several breeds, {{including}} Turkish Van, Turkish Angora, Sphynx, Persian, Oriental Shorthair, Japanese Bobtail and Khao Manee. In 1817, {{the government of}} Turkey, {{in conjunction with the}} Ankara Zoo, began a meticulous breeding program to preserve and protect pure white Turkish Angora cats with blue and amber eyes, a program that continues today, as they are considered a national treasure. The zoo specifically prized the <b>odd-eyed</b> Angoras who had one blue eye and one amber eye, as the Turkish folklore suggests that [...] "the eyes must be as green as the lake and as blue as the sky." [...] The mascot of the 2010 FIBA World Championship, hosted by Turkey, was an anthropomorphized <b>odd-eyed</b> Van Cat named [...] "Bascat".|$|E
50|$|As {{with some}} newborn mammals, all cats are blue-eyed as kittens, and may {{change as the}} newborn ages. The {{differences}} in an <b>odd-eyed</b> kitten's eye color might not be noticeable, save upon close inspection. <b>Odd-eyed</b> kittens have a different shade of blue in each eye. The color of the odd eye changes {{over a period of}} months-for example, from blue to green to yellow or from green to blue to yellow-until it reaches its final, adult color.|$|E
50|$|Eye colors range widely, and {{may include}} blue, copper, <b>odd-eyed</b> blue and copper, green, blue-green, and hazel. Various TICA and CFA coat categorizations come with {{specific}} eye-color requirements.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that all <b>odd-eyed</b> cats are born deaf in one ear. This is not true, as about 60%-70% of <b>odd-eyed</b> cats can hear. About 10%-20% of normal-eyed cats are born deaf or become deaf {{as part of the}} feline aging process. White cats with one or two blue eyes do, however, have a higher incidence of genetic deafness, with the white gene occasionally causing the degeneration of the cochlea, beginning a few days after birth. If a white kitten has any speck of another color, the frequency of deafness is greatly diminished, even if the speck of coloration fades as the cat becomes more mature.|$|E
50|$|Ranceford (voiced by Katherine Ryan) is a white, <b>odd-eyed</b> cat. Max harbors a {{crush on}} her, but like the other animals, she prefers Gark over Max. She {{is the leader of}} The Sunshine Circle of Cats and denies Max membership.|$|E
5000|$|He {{attached}} {{importance to}} his horse Sakarya {{and his dog}} Fox. He was also anecdotally linked to preservation of Turkish Angora after {{an article in the}} Turkey's Reader's Digest reportedly claimed that Atatürk said [...] "his successor would be bitten on the ankle by an <b>odd-eyed</b> white cat.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>odd-eyed</b> cat is a {{cat with}} one blue eye and one eye either green, yellow, or brown. This is a feline form of {{complete}} heterochromia, {{a condition that}} occurs in some other animals. The condition most commonly affects white-colored cats, but {{may be found in}} a cat of any color, provided that it possesses the white spotting gene.|$|E
50|$|The European Shorthair's dense coat is short, {{soft and}} glossy, and should lie flat. All natural colours are permitted, such as black, red, blue and cream, {{with or without}} tabby or white markings. Pure white is also permitted. The eye colour {{corresponds}} to the coat colour and may be yellow, green or orange. Blue or <b>odd-eyed</b> individuals are permitted if the coat colour is white.|$|E
5000|$|Rarely, a Japanese Bobtail, {{especially}} {{a predominantly white}} specimen, may have heterochromia, or eyes of different colors. Regardless of breed, cats with this trait are known as <b>odd-eyed</b> cats. In this breed, one iris is blue ("silver" [...] in Japanese breeding terms) while the other is yellow ("gold"). This trait {{is more common in}} this breed than in most others, with the notable exception of the Turkish Van.|$|E
50|$|In flash photographs, <b>odd-eyed</b> cats {{typically}} show a red-eye {{effect in}} the blue eye, {{but not in the}} other eye. This is due to the combined effect of the (normal) presence of a tapetum lucidum in both eyes and the absence of melanin in the blue eye. The tapetum lucidum produces eyeshine in both eyes, but in the non-blue eye a layer of melanin over the tapetum lucidum selectively removes some colors of light.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Ankara Zoo, began a {{breeding}} program {{to protect and}} preserve pure white Angora cats. [...] The zoo particularly prized <b>odd-eyed</b> Angoras (i.e., Turkish Angoras with one blue eye and one amber eye), however the cats were chosen only by their color (white)—no other criterion was used. Despite the lack of selective breeding and no consideration given for the deafness problem, Ankara Zoo cats have a very similar type.|$|E
50|$|The W gene {{responsible}} for the white coat and blue eye {{is closely related to}} the hearing ability, in this and other breeds, and presence of a blue eye can indicate the cat is deaf to the side the blue eye is located, with some being totally deaf if bearing two blue eyes. However, a great many blue and <b>odd-eyed</b> white cats have normal hearing, and even deaf cats lead a normal life if kept indoors.|$|E
5000|$|Oriental Longhairs {{feature a}} long, tubular, Oriental-style body {{but with a}} longer silky coat. The range of {{possible}} coat colours includes everything from self-coloured (black, blue, chocolate, lilac, cinnamon, caramel, fawn, red, cream and apricot), tortoiseshell, smoke (silver undercoat), shaded or tipped, tabby or white. The eyes are almond shaped. The preferred eye color for Oriental Longhairs is green; except for the whites, which may have green or blue eyes, or be <b>odd-eyed</b> (two different colored eyes).|$|E
50|$|Eye {{color is}} {{considered}} a subset of coloring, and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes, as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or vice versa. The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink, ruby, and <b>odd-eyed</b> (two different-colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown. Ruby refers to eyes which at a glance appear black but which are on closer observation a deep, dark red.|$|E
50|$|Eyes may be blue, green, or amber, or {{even one}} blue and one amber or green. The W gene which is {{responsible}} for the white coat and blue eye is closely related to the hearing ability, and the presence of a blue eye can indicate that the cat is deaf to the side the blue eye is located. However, a great many blue and <b>odd-eyed</b> white cats have normal hearing, and even deaf cats lead a very normal life if kept indoors.|$|E
50|$|The <b>odd-eyed</b> {{coloring}} {{is caused}} when either the epistatic (dominant) white gene (which masks any other color genes and turns a cat completely white) {{or the white}} spotting gene (which is the gene responsible for bicolor and tuxedo cats) prevents melanin (pigment) granules from reaching one eye during development, resulting in a cat with one blue eye and one green, yellow, or brown eye. The condition only rarely occurs in cats that lack both the dominant white and the white spotting gene.|$|E
50|$|Congenital sensorineural {{deafness}} occurs in domestic cats {{with a white}} coat. It is a congenital deafness caused by a degeneration of the inner ear. Deafness can occur in white cats with yellow, green or blue irises, although it is mostly likely in white cats with blue irises. In white cats with mixed-coloured eyes (<b>odd-eyed</b> cats), {{it has been found}} that deafness is more likely to affect the ear on the blue-eyed side. White cats can have blue, gold, green, or copper coloured odd eyes.|$|E
5000|$|The Van cat (Van kedisi 'cat of Van', plural Վանա կատու Vana katou, Western Armenian: Vana gadou; Pisîka Wanê) is a {{distinctive}} landrace of domestic cat, {{found in the}} Lake Van region of eastern Turkey. It is relatively large, has a chalky white coat, sometimes with ruddy coloration {{on the head and}} hindquarters, and has blue or amber eyes or is <b>odd-eyed</b> (having one eye of each colour). [...] The variety has been referred to as [...] "the swimming cat", and observed to swim in Lake Van.|$|E
50|$|Siamese Cat Park (อุทยานแมวไทยโบราณ) is a {{farm where}} a rare breed of Siamese cats named Khao Manee (ขาวมณี) are kept and maintained. The cats are white and <b>odd-eyed,</b> i.e., {{left and right}} eyes have {{different}} colors. The possible eye colors are emerald, yellow sapphire, amber, brown, grey, diamond, blue, and light blue. It descends from royal felines of King Chulalongkorn where only nine were left before the attempt to preserve this breed was initiated by the king. The park was recently moved to Liap Khlong Thawi Watthana Road (ถนนเลียบคลองทวีวัฒนา).|$|E
50|$|Cats {{and dogs}} {{with a blue}} eye color may display both eyeshine and red-eye effect. Both species have a tapetum lucidum, so their pupils may display eyeshine. In flash color photographs, however, {{individuals}} with blue eyes may also display a distinctive red eyeshine. Individuals with heterochromia may display red eyeshine in the blue eye and normal yellow/green/blue/white eyeshine in the other eye. These include <b>odd-eyed</b> cats and bi-eyed dogs. The red-eye effect is independent of the eyeshine: in some photographs of individuals with a tapetum lucidum and heterochromia, the eyeshine is dim, yet the pupil of the blue eye still appears red. This is most apparent when the individual is not looking into the camera because the tapetum lucidum is far less extensive than the retina.|$|E
50|$|A Turkish Van {{may have}} blue eyes, amber eyes, or be <b>odd-eyed</b> (having one eye of each colour, a {{condition}} known as heterochromia iridis). The variability of eye colour is genetically {{caused by the}} white spotting factor, which is a characteristic of this breed. The white spotting factor is the variable expression of the piebald gene that varies from the minimal degree (1), as in the blue-eyed cats with white tip on the tail to the maximal degree (8-9) that results in a Van-patterned cat, as in Van cats, when coloured marks occupy at most 20% of the white background, but the white background in the breed covers about 80% of the body. Breeding two cats together with {{the same level of}} white spotting will produce cats with a similar degree of spotting.|$|E
50|$|The Turkish Van is a semi-long-haired {{breed of}} {{domestic}} cat, which {{was developed in}} the United Kingdom from a selection of cats obtained from various cities of modern Turkey, especially Southeast Turkey. The breed is rare, and is distinguished by the Van pattern (named for the breed), where the colour is restricted to the head and the tail, {{and the rest of the}} cat is white; this is due to the expression of the piebald white spotting gene, a type of partial leucism. A Turkish Van may have blue or amber eyes, or be <b>odd-eyed</b> (having one eye of each colour). The breed has been claimed to be descended from the landrace of usually all-white Van cats (Van kedisi), mostly found near Lake Van, though one of the two original breeders' own writings indicate clearly that none of the breed's foundation cats came from the Van area.|$|E
50|$|Although {{infrequently}} seen in humans, complete heterochromia is {{more frequently}} observed in other species, where it almost always involves one blue eye. The blue eye occurs within a white spot, where melanin is {{absent from the}} skin and hair (see Leucism). These species include the cat, particularly breeds such as Turkish Van, Turkish Angora, Khao Manee and (rarely) Japanese Bobtail. These so-called <b>odd-eyed</b> cats are white, or mostly white, with one normal eye (copper, orange, yellow, green), and one blue eye. Among dogs, complete heterochromia is seen often in the Siberian Husky and few other breeds, usually Australian Shepherd and Catahoula Leopard Dog and rarely in Shih Tzu. Horses with complete heterochromia have one brown and one white, gray, or blue eye—complete heterochromia {{is more common in}} horses with pinto coloring. Complete heterochromia occurs also in cattle and even water buffalo. It can also be seen in ferrets with Waardenburg syndrome, although it can be very hard to tell at times as the eye color is often a midnight blue.|$|E
