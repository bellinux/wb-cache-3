30|$|<b>The</b> urgent problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{relaying}} {{protection in}} the modern AC/DC hybrid connected grid and <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> area communication, <b>the</b> information process and the intelligent technology powerfully promotes <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> area relaying protection (WARP), {{which has become a}} research hotspot that attracts extensive attention. Originated from <b>the</b> basic concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> area relaying protection, this paper analyses the advantages, the effects and <b>the</b> functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> area relaying protection. The two main approaches to realize <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> area protection, which are on-line adaptive setting (OAS) principle and fault element identification (FEI), are introduced in this paper. Aimed at improving <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> backup protection, the research content and <b>the</b> technology demand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> area protection are proposed, meanwhile, the basic principle and <b>the</b> algorithm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fault element identification are introduced. At last, <b>the</b> scheme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> limited <b>wide</b> area relaying protection based on the existing pilot channel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main protection is discussed.|$|R

5|$|Caddisfly {{cases are}} open at both ends, the larvae drawing oxygenated water through the {{posterior}} end, over their gills, and pumping it out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wider,</b> anterior end. The larvae move around inside the tubes and this helps maintain the water current; {{the lower the}} oxygen content of the water, the more active the larvae need to be. This mechanism enable caddisfly larvae to live in waters too low in oxygen content to support stonefly and mayfly larvae.|$|E
