40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the {{reaction}} of lead tetraacetate with anethole to form diacetox-yanethole in acetic acid proceeds through a formation of an addition compound. The con-centrations of the adduct are determined by an equilbrium equation: Anethole+ lead tetra-acetate,=adduct. For the first time, such an equilibrium between an <b>olefinic</b> <b>compound</b> and lead tetraacetate has been demonstrated. The rates of the formation of the final product are first-order with respect to the adduct. The reaction proceeds faster in the solvents with stronger ionizing power. The reaction of lead tetraacetate with olefinic compounds to form diacetoxy compounds is one of the typical reactions of this reagent with organic compounds". To make clear this mechanism, the kinetics of the reaction with anethole has been studied by following the decreases of the lead tetraacetate concentrations iodome-trically, since this reaction proceeds without appreciable side reactions under the conditions convenient to the kinetic study.

40|$|The use of {{principles}} of supramolecular chemistry to direct reactions in the crystalline state {{has emerged as}} a reliable means to facilitate highly selective reactions in a solvent-free environment. In this context, we have utilized the fixed spatial arrangements of molecules in a crystal lattice to promote intermolecular [2 + 2] photodimerizations. We have shown how principles of supramolecular chemistry can be used to preorganize olefins to undergo intermolecular [2 + 2] photodimerizations in the solid state. Explorations into fluorinated and partially fluorinated olefinic substrates has allowed for development of underutilized supramolecular interactions to direct such chemical reactions. We reported interactions between fluorinated molecules in inorganic complexes and organic solids that supported intermolecular [2 + 2] photodimerizations as well as cross-reactions between olefinic species. Analogous to the hydrogen bond templates commonly utilized by our group to engineer reactive solids, we expanded the methodology by developing templates that direct reactions via halogen bonding. We report on the use of a halogen-bond-acceptor template to direct the formation of a small molecule lined with I- and F-atoms. We demonstrate the olefins in the solid undergo a [2 + 2] photodimerization with UV radiation in a stereoselective and quantitative manner. Our work provides the first use of halogen bonds to direct the formation of a small-molecule lined with halogen atoms in a solid. We reveal the halogenated product provides access to a unique family of host-guest materials that exhibit an extremely rare form of self-inclusion. We describe the ability of halogen bonds to undergo bending deformations. There are currently great interests in halogen bonds as related to applications to organic synthesis, supramolecular chemistry, and materials science. While halogen bonds are often compared to hydrogen bonds, the wealth of knowledge concerning the fundamentals and behavior of halogen bonds has admittedly experienced less time to develop. In our work on single-crystal reactions and transformations, we have discovered the ability of halogen bonds based on rigid interacting partners to bend and deform. We provide a quantitative comparison of the bending to the literature to demonstrate how the geometric landscape of the bending compares to known data. We report a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation of a cocrystalline material involving a fluorinated, <b>olefinic</b> <b>compound.</b> The olefins adopt a well-defined, reactive geometry mediated by halogen-bonding templates. We exploit metal-organic complexes to fix spatial arrangements of molecules in crystal lattices to promote intermolecular [2 + 2] photodimerizations. Perfluorophenyl-perfluorophenyl (C 6 F 5 ···C 6 F 5) interactions have recently emerged as a means to control supramolecular architectures and frameworks. However, it was not clear whether perfluorophenyl-perfluorophenyl interactions can be integrated in [2 + 2] photodimerizations in solids. We describe the significant effect fluorine exercised on the structure and photoreactivity of an octafluoro stilbene derivative in the solid state. Specifically, we report the olefin, trans- 1, 2 -bis(2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrafluorophenyl) ethylene, self-assembles via C-H···F and perfluorophenyl-perfluorophenyl interactions for a stereoselective and quantitative topochemical photodimerization. Lastly, principles of crystal engineering and supramolecular chemistry are exploited to design and achieve a supramolecular protecting group strategy for the solid-state synthesis of a cyclobutane—a cyclobutane that supports a rare hydrogen-bonded self-catenating framework. The application of a hydrogen bonding coformer to separate a trans-isomer of a pyrimidyl olefin directly from a Wittig reaction is demonstrated. The coformer supports a head-to-head [2 + 2] photodimerization in the solid state. The work demonstrated here describes our explorations into the supramolecular interactions of organic fluorine, and how such interactions can be used to facilitate the synthesis of small molecules via [2 + 2] photodimerizations in solids—alone and in accompaniment of other crystal engineering strategies...|$|E

This work explores the utility of metallic silver sputtering on tissue sections for high resolution imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) of olefins by laser desorption ionization (LDI). For this purpose, sputtered silver coating thickness was optimized on an assorted selection of mouse and rat tissues including brain, kidney, liver, and testis. For mouse brain tissue section, the thickness was adjusted to 23 ± 2 nm of silver to prevent ion suppression effects associated with a higher cholesterol and lipid content. On all other tissues, a thickness of at 16 ± 2 nm provided the best desorption/ionization efficiency.

Significant changes in the light hydrocarbon composition with depth were attributed either to changes in kerogen type or to maturity related effects. Redistribution pheonomena, possibly the result of diffusion, were recognized only sporadically in Hole 530 A, where several organic-carbon lean samples were enriched by migrated gaseous hydrocarbons. The core samples from Hole 530 A were found to be severely contaminated by large quantities of acetone, which is routinely used as a solvent during sampling procedures on board Glomar Challenger...|$|R
40|$|Fluid {{catalytic}} cracking (FCC) {{is one of}} the most important conversion processes in petroleum refineries. In modern FCC units, the risers have served as the major commercial reactor, where the low value heavy hydrocarbons were cracked into more valuable products such as gasoline and light <b>olefinic</b> <b>compounds.</b> And a regenerator is used for recovering catalysts 2 ̆ 7 reactivity. These two reactors collaborate with each other to crack the feed oil and realize the recycle of the expensive and considerable quantity of catalyst in FCC units. In this thesis, CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) has been used to simulate three-dimensional multi-phase, multi-species, turbulent reacting flow in fluid {{catalytic cracking}} (FCC) process. In the regenerator, a three dimensional multiphase model which used to simulate the gas-solid two phases flow hydrodynamics and inter phase reactions was presented. A modified drag model used to describe the gas-solid two phases interaction was developed. The results obtained from numerical iterations have a good agreement with the field data. Parametric studies on operation parameters such as air flow rate and oxygen enrichment were conducted based on the real operation experiences. In the riser, FCC catalyst, oil, and air were used as the solid, liquid, and gas three phases, respectively. A hybrid technique for coupling chemical kinetics and hydrodynamics computations was employed, where the simulation was divided into two parts, one is reacting flow hydrodynamic simulation with a small but sufficient number of lumped reactions to compute flow filed properties, and the other is reacting flow hydrodynamics with many subspecies where complex chemical reactions occur. A four-lump kinetic model was used for the major species simulation and a fourteen-lump kinetic model was used for the subspecies simulation. The results were validated against measurements. And the effect of catalyst temperature on the cracking reactions was evaluated. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} biomass {{fluidized}} catalytic cracking (BFCC) has been {{adapted from the}} traditional fluidized catalytic cracking of crude oil in petroleum refineries. Instead of a naphtha feedstock, BFCC can accommodate various types of biomass that is cracked into more valuable aromatic and <b>olefinic</b> <b>compounds.</b> This plant inputs forest biomass and will be located in southwestern Louisiana, where wood output exceeds 100 million kg/yr in over ten counties. Biomass, procured {{in the form of}} wood chips, must first be dried to a moisture content below 10 wt% and crushed to a particle size of 100 - 500 micron. The wood sawdust is then fed to a circulating fluidized bed riser, where it undergoes catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) {{in the presence of a}} ZSM- 5 catalyst. CFP occurs at a high temperature of 600 °C, producing an effluent syngas composed of aromatics, olefins, and volatiles. The biogas is separated from water and volatiles, produced by deoxygenation processes, in a three phase pressure vessel. The more valuable products of benzene, toluene, and xylenes are then separated from the high-boiling components. The proposed design converts 400, 000 metric tons of wood to 17. 4 million kilograms of a BTX mixture per year, including 4. 6, 7, and 3. 3 million kilograms per year of benzene, toluene, and xylenes, respectively. In addition, 345 GWh of electricity is produced yearly as a byproduct. The required total permanent investment for this project is $ 93 MM. At a discount rate of 10 % and BTX sale price of $ 1. 1 /kg, the base case net present value (NPV) is $(157 MM) and the expected ROI is - 20 %. The result of this base case analysis suggests that this project should not be further pursued. The best case scenario assumed double the yield of BTX at a sale price of $ 1. 54 /kg and a renewable fuel credit of $ 1. 01 /gal, resulting in a NPV of $ 506 MM, an IRR of 70 %, and a ROI of 81 %. The economic feasibility of this project is also sensitive to the availability and price of biomass, as well as the catalyst degeneration rate within the system...|$|R
40|$|New acyclic dibenzyloxy disulfides {{substituted}} in the {{para position}} were prepared by a modified procedure in very high yield (ca. 85 %). Each {{of them were}} found to display an AB quartet in the 1 H NMR spectrum, suggesting the possible existence of the isomeric thionosulfite structure (RO) 2 S=S {{in contrast to the}} more commonly proposed linear structure R-O-S-S-O-R. This structure question was addressed by preparing a series of closely related compounds including the analogous disulfide R 2 S 2, tetrasulfide R 2 S 4, "oxytrisulfide" R-O-S 3 -R, sulfoxylate R-O-S-O-R, sulfite (RO) 2 S=O, cyclic thionosulfite and corresponding cyclic sulfite, followed by comparative 1 H and 13 C NMR studies. The solid state structure was established to be linear according to X-ray analysis with somewhat short S-S bond length compared with conventional disulfide structures. The possible interconversion between the linear and the branched isomer was ruled out following an extensive spectroscopic study including 17 O NMR, IR, Raman and UV. The solid/solution structure was established to be linear with a rigid gauche conformation dependent of a barrier to rotation of ca. 18 kcal mol- 1 (Tc = 75 °C). This barrier was responsible for the diastereotopicity of the adjacent benzylic protons, giving rise to asymmetric induction, and permitted the detection of the enantiomers with the chiral shift reagent Eu(hfc) 3 in chloroform at room temperature. The existence of rotational diastereomers was demonstrated by 1 H and 13 C NMR for chiral dialkoxy disulfides prepared from enantiomerically pure chiral and racemic alcohols. A temperature dependent NMR study revealed that dibenzyloxy disulfides can deliver singlet diatomic sulfur S 2. The thermolysis was studied in different solvents in the presence of different dienes. The disulfide adduct and the diene were comparably competitive for the S 2 transfer. Tetrasulfide adducts were obtained in the presence of dimethyl and diphenyl butadiene, but converted to the disulfide adduct upon triphenylphosphine treatment. The related "oxytrisulfide" was demonstrated to also transfer the S 2 unit to dienes. A brief analysis of a known thionosulfite has shown its potential to transfer S 2 units to dienes. Mechanistic considerations were proposed to rationalize the <b>olefinic</b> <b>compounds</b> formed. Triphenylphosphine desulfurization of dialkoxy disulfides yielded the corresponding sulfoxylates. The kinetics of the conversion of these to the corresponding sulfinates RO(S=O) R were examined and found to be first order; the Arrhenius parameters were determined...|$|R
40|$|This work {{identifies}} {{classes of}} cool flame intermediates from n-heptane low-temperature oxidation in a jet-stirred reactor (JSR) and a motored cooperative fuel research (CFR) engine. The sampled species from the JSR oxidation of {{a mixture of}} n-heptane/O 2 /Ar (0. 01 / 0. 11 / 0. 88) were analyzed using a synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet radiation photoionization (SVUV-PI) time-of-flight molecular-beam mass spectrometer (MBMS) and an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) Orbitrap mass spectrometer (OTMS). The OTMS was also {{used to analyze the}} sampled species from a CFR engine exhaust. Approximately 70 intermediates were detected by the SVUV-PI-MBMS, and their assigned molecular formulae are in good agreement with those detected by the APCI-OTMS, which has ultra-high mass resolving power and provides an accurate elemental C/H/O composition of the intermediate species. Furthermore, the results show that the species formed during the partial oxidation of n-heptane in the CFR engine are very similar to those produced in an ideal reactor, i. e., a JSR. The products can be classified by species with molecular formulae of C 7 H 14 Ox (x =  0 – 5), C 7 H 12 Ox (x =  0 – 4), C 7 H 10 Ox (x =  0 – 4), CnH 2 n (n =  2 – 6), CnH 2 n− 2 (n =  4 – 6), CnH 2 n+ 2 O (n =  1 – 4), CnH 2 nO (n =  1 – 6), CnH 2 n− 2 O (n =  2 – 6), CnH 2 n− 4 O (n =  4 – 6), CnH 2 n+ 2 O 2 (n =  0 – 4, 7), CnH 2 nO 2 (n =  1 – 6), CnH 2 n− 2 O 2 (n =  2 – 6), CnH 2 n− 4 O 2 (n =  4 – 6), and CnH 2 nO 3 (n =  3 – 6). The identified intermediate species include alkenes, dienes, aldehyde/keto <b>compounds,</b> <b>olefinic</b> aldehyde/keto <b>compounds,</b> diones, cyclic ethers, peroxides, acids, and alcohols/ethers.

40|$|The {{reaction}} {{between a}} halogen or hydrogen halide and an olefinic substance {{is one of}} the fundamental reactions of organic chemistry. It is not surprising, therefore, that considerable attention has been given to the kinetics of the electrophilic and nucleophilic addition of halogens or hydrogen halides to olefins under the influence of both thermal and photochemical activation (1 - 6). The factors most likely to influence the rate of the reaction viz., the nature of the olefin and its substituent groups, the particular halogen or hydrogen halide employed, the temperature, the influence of catalysts and the powerful solvent effects have all been investigated in detail with the result that this seemingly straightforward class of reactions has been shown to possess considerable complexity. On the other hand, the kinetics of the reactions of hypohalous acids, and in particular hypochlorous acid, with olefins has received rather scant attention. In some ways this is remarkable {{in view of the fact}} that the formation of chlorohydrins by this reaction has been known for at least seventy years when Erlenmeyer and Muller (7) and Melikov (8. 9) investigated the addition of hypochlorous acid to the isomeric crotonic acids. Perhaps the most important contribution to our knowledge of reactions of this kind is due to Bloomfield and co-workers (10, 11) who, while investigating the addition of olefinic acids and esters towards hypochlorous acid and ethyl hypochlorite, isolated, identified and estimated the relative amounts of the isomeric chlorohydrins formed in this reaction. At about the same time, Shilov and collaborators began an investigation of the kinetics of the reactions involving the addition of hypochlorous acid to <b>olefinic</b> <b>compounds</b> and during the past eighteen years, a series of papers from this source have been published Ca- 30. It is unfortunate that these investigators should have studied the catalytic effect of added chloride ion, usually from hydrochloric acid, in the majority of their reaction systems as the intervention of molecular chlorine formed in this way would seriously interfere with the true nature of hypochlorous acid additions. The results of early work by Shilov et al. (14) on the addition to ethene, indicated that the addition of chlorine to the double bond was about 100, 000 times greater than that of hypochlorous acid, yet it was only in later papers (10. - 22) that this complicating factor seemed to be fully appreciated. However, during their early work they concluded that the addition reaction was a complex one and could not be described by a simple bimolecular or termolecular process. It seemed, therefore, that a detailed investigation of the kinetics of chlorohydrin formation was desirable and would prove a profitable and useful subject for research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In forested ecosystems, {{water soluble}} organics play an {{important}} role in soil processes including carbon and nutrient turnover, microbial activity and pedogenesis. The quantity and quality (i. e., chemistry) of these materials is sensitive to land manage-ment practices. Monitoring alterations in the chemistry of water soluble orgat~ics resulting from land management practices is difficult because of the complexity and low concentration of these compounds. A procedure is described in which the water soluble organics are quantitatively derivatized with trifluoroacetic anhydride and then ariatyzed by liquid state proton nuclear magnetic resonance ('H NMK). The procedure was applied to sample amounts as low as 0. 03 mg from the forest floor and root exudates. The root exudate samples were dominated by aliphatic coinpounds with relatively few 0 -alkyl, <b>olefinic</b> and aromatic <b>compounds.</b> The chemistry of the samples originating from the forest floor differed dramatically with soil texture and treatment combinations...|$|R
