5|$|Ethiopia: In Ethiopia, {{where the}} size of the {{elephant}} population has decreased by 90% since the 1980s, officials issued a National Ivory Action Plan to address poaching and ivory trafficking. Among <b>other</b> <b>strategies,</b> the Plan includes the publicized destruction of seized ivory. The first such event took place in March 2015, in Addis Ababa, where the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority's 6.1-ton stockpile was burned.|$|E
5|$|Screening among {{family members}} of people with known FH is cost-effective. <b>Other</b> <b>strategies</b> such as {{universal}} screening {{at the age of}} 16 were suggested in 2001. The latter approach may however be less cost-effective in the short term. Screening at an age lower than 16 was thought likely to lead to an unacceptably high rate of false positives.|$|E
5|$|Cavities are {{in great}} demand for nesting by other cavity nesters, so {{woodpeckers}} face {{competition for the}} nesting sites they excavate {{from the moment the}} hole becomes usable. This may come from other species of woodpecker, or other cavity nesting birds like swallows and starlings. Woodpeckers may aggressively harass potential competitors, and also use <b>other</b> <b>strategies</b> to reduce the chance of being usurped from their nesting site; for example the red-crowned woodpecker digs its nest in the underside of a small branch, which reduces the chance that a larger species will take it over and expand it.|$|E

25|$|Strategy B is {{strictly}} dominated if some <b>other</b> <b>strategy</b> exists that strictly dominates B.|$|R
50|$|A Nash {{equilibrium}} is {{a strategy}} profile (a strategy profile specifies a strategy for every player, e.g. in the above prisoners' dilemma game (cooperate, defect) specifies that prisoner 1 plays cooperate and player 2 plays defect) in which every strategy is a best response to every <b>other</b> <b>strategy</b> played. A strategy by a player is a best response to another player's strategy {{if there is no}} <b>other</b> <b>strategy</b> that could be played that would yield a higher pay-off in any situation in which the <b>other</b> player's <b>strategy</b> is played.|$|R
25|$|Strategy B is weakly {{dominant}} if strategy B dominates all <b>other</b> <b>strategies,</b> {{but some}} (or all) strategies are only weakly dominated by B.|$|E
25|$|Organization. Adolescents {{are more}} aware of their thought {{processes}} and can use mnemonic devices and <b>other</b> <b>strategies</b> to think more efficiently.|$|E
25|$|Affirmative existential {{sentences}} {{never use}} re, but have to employ <b>other</b> <b>strategies.</b> These {{include the use}} of the predicate mo hese 'one', or a locative phrase.|$|E
50|$|Fryhtan Wars {{retains a}} great deal of {{concepts}} from its predecessors that distinguished it from <b>other</b> <b>strategy</b> games.|$|R
50|$|It {{follows that}} the optimum {{strategy}} is (2, 2, 2) {{as it does}} not do worse than breaking even against any <b>other</b> <b>strategy</b> while beating one <b>other</b> <b>strategy.</b> There are however several Nash equilibria. If both players choose the strategy (2, 2, 2) or (1, 2, 3), then none of them can beat the other one by changing strategies, so every such strategy pair is a Nash equilibrium.|$|R
50|$|Unlike some <b>other</b> <b>strategy</b> {{games from}} Paradox, you can {{customize}} {{the formation of}} your armies to (for example) determine which units go on which flanks.|$|R
25|$|Isolation, gaslighting, mind {{games and}} divide and rule are <b>other</b> <b>strategies</b> {{that are often}} used. The victim may be plied with alcohol or drugs to help disorientate them.|$|E
25|$|In its conclusion, {{the book}} states that {{hydrogen}} {{will not be}} widely available as a transportation fuel for a long time, and describes <b>other</b> <b>strategies,</b> including energy conservation techniques, to combat global warming.|$|E
25|$|RISC was {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} to what is now known as CISC. Over the years, <b>other</b> <b>strategies</b> have been implemented as alternatives to RISC and CISC. Some examples are very long instruction word (VLIW) and minimal instruction set computer (MISC).|$|E
50|$|Major 4X {{games like}} Civilization and Master of Orion {{have a much}} larger {{technology}} tree than most <b>other</b> <b>strategy</b> games; as an extreme example, Space Empires III has over 200 technologies.|$|R
50|$|The <b>other</b> <b>strategy</b> is to {{test whether}} a {{compound}} has effects strong enough to reach a pre-set level. In this strategy, false-negative rates (FNRs) and/or false-positive rates (FPRs) must be controlled.|$|R
50|$|Of course, one can regard a pure {{strategy}} as a degenerate {{case of a}} mixed strategy, in which that particular {{pure strategy}} is selected with probability 1 and every <b>other</b> <b>strategy</b> with probability 0.|$|R
25|$|In {{the more}} general case, where {{sub-goals}} share variables, <b>other</b> <b>strategies</b> can be used, such as choosing the subgoal that is most highly instantiated or that is sufficiently instantiated so that only one procedure applies. Such strategies are used, for example, in concurrent logic programming.|$|E
25|$|<b>Other</b> <b>strategies</b> employ strike {{teams of}} Israeli {{intelligence}} or military operatives. These operatives infiltrate areas known to harbor targeted individuals, and eliminate their assigned targets with small arms fire {{or use of}} explosives. Snipers have also been utilized, as was {{in the case of}} Dr. Thabet Thabet in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Lessig {{dropped out}} of the Democratic primary on November 2, 2015, shortly after the rules for {{participation}} in the next debate were changed such that he would no longer qualify. He then considered <b>other</b> <b>strategies</b> to advance his reform agenda, including the possibility of an independent run.|$|E
40|$|From antiquity onwards, {{sports and}} {{competitive}} athletic events {{have been used}} as an area to implement <b>othering</b> <b>strategies.</b> <b>Othering</b> is the attempt to differentiate a societal group by some determining factor. Evidence of athletics being used as an othering medium, is prevalent throughout ancient Greece, ancient Rome, Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, and early 20 th century Britain...|$|R
50|$|People {{engage in}} passive, active, or {{interactive}} strategies to reduce uncertainty with <b>others.</b> <b>Strategies</b> as seeking information, focusing on primary goals, contingency planning, plan adaptation, accretive planning, and framing are often utilized by human communicators.|$|R
30|$|The <b>other</b> <b>strategy</b> {{explains}} another technical {{procedure in}} order to remove deficiencies of first protocol. It can be hypothesized that the nickel lamination on top of copper-plated fabric induces both durability and homogenous high level of conductivity to fabric.|$|R
25|$|Clofibrate is {{effective}} at lowering cholesterol levels, {{but has been}} associated with significantly increased cancer and stroke mortality, despite lowered cholesterol levels. Other, more recently developed and tested fibrates, e.g. fenofibric acid have had a better track record and are primarily promoted for lowering VLDL particles (triglycerides), not LDL particles, yet can help some in combination with <b>other</b> <b>strategies.</b>|$|E
25|$|Numerous <b>other</b> <b>strategies</b> may be used, {{including}} {{alternative medicine}} techniques (see List of branches of alternative medicine); exercise and physical fitness, including team sports; occupational therapy techniques, including creative arts; having structure and routine to the days, particularly through employment - helping feelings of competence (e.g. self-efficacy), having a social role and being valued by others, boosting self-esteem.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategy}} of the long sword is different from <b>other</b> <b>strategies</b> {{in that it is}} much more straightforward. In the {{strategy of}} the longsword, it seems that Musashi's ideal was that by mastering gripping the sword, it could become a platform used for moving onto the mastery of Ni-Ten Ichi Ryu as well as being able to use two broadswords or use a companion sword better.|$|E
50|$|Rise of Nations and its {{expansion}} pack Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots {{have received}} combined sales of over 1 million copies, despite it receiving less advertising and media attention as its <b>other</b> <b>strategy</b> counterpart, the popular Age of Empires series.|$|R
500|$|While many {{computer}} {{strategy games}} arguably contain a similar [...] "explore, expand, exploit, exterminate" [...] cycle, game journalists, developers and enthusiasts generally apply [...] "4X" [...] {{to a more}} specific class of games, and contrast 4X games with <b>other</b> <b>strategy</b> games such as Command & Conquer. Hence, writers have tried to show how 4X games are defined by more than just having {{each of the four}} Xs. Computer gaming sites have stated that 4X games are distinguished by their greater complexity and scale, and their intricate use of diplomacy beyond the standard [...] "friend or foe" [...] seen in <b>other</b> <b>strategy</b> games. Reviewers have also stated that 4X games feature a range of diplomatic options, and that they are well known for their large detailed empires and complex gameplay. In particular, 4X games offer detailed control over an empire's economy, while <b>other</b> computer <b>strategy</b> games simplify this in favor of combat-focused gameplay.|$|R

25|$|During the 1990s the New York City Police Department (NYPD) adopted CompStat, {{broken windows}} {{policing}} and <b>other</b> <b>strategies</b> {{in a major}} effort to reduce crime. The city's dramatic drop in crime has been attributed by criminologists to policing tactics, {{the end of the}} crack epidemic, and some have speculated more controversial ideas such as the legalization of abortion approximately 18 years previous and the decline of lead poisoning of children.|$|E
25|$|Aspect {{is unusual}} in ASL in that {{transitive}} verbs derived for aspect lose their transitivity. That is, while you can sign 'dog chew bone' for the dog chewed on a bone, or 'she look-at me' for she looked at me, you cannot {{do the same in}} the durative to mean the dog gnawed on the bone or she stared at me. Instead, you must use <b>other</b> <b>strategies,</b> such as a topic construction (see below) to avoid having an object for the verb.|$|E
25|$|Loco-regional therapy (also {{referred}} to as liver-directed therapy) refers {{to any one of}} several minimally-invasive treatment techniques to focally target HCC within the liver. These procedures are alternatives to surgery, and may be considered in combination with <b>other</b> <b>strategies,</b> such as a later liver transplantation. Generally, these treatment procedures are performed by interventional radiologists or surgeons, in coordination with a medical oncologist. Loco-regional therapy may refer to either percutaneous therapies, such as microwave or cryoablation, or arterial catheter-based therapies, such as chemoembolization and radioembolization.|$|E
50|$|Deadlock II: Shrine Wars {{features}} seven alien races {{each with}} their own strengths and weaknesses. The racial abilities are not as pronounced {{as they are in}} <b>other</b> <b>strategy</b> games such as Warcraft but can still greatly affect the way in which each race is played.|$|R
50|$|The game's Essence 3.0 engine {{introduces}} the TrueSight system, {{which aims to}} better emulate troop visibility in real combat. In contrast to overhead visibility seen in <b>other</b> <b>strategy</b> games, TrueSight more accurately represents a unit's visibility range based on environmental conditions and type of unit.|$|R
