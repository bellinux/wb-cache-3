5|$|A {{mandatory}} <b>order</b> <b>is</b> {{an order}} of the High Court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, {{has the effect of}} invalidating an ultra vires decision made by an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing <b>order</b> <b>is</b> a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E

A person who complies with a mandatory order cannot have legal proceedings taken against him or her for doing so.|$|E

40|$|A new vector <b>ordering</b> <b>is</b> {{proposed}} and {{its application to}} colour image processing demonstrated.

As the initial <b>ordering</b> <b>is</b> based on pairs of vec-tors, the technique is termed pairwise vector ordering. The new <b>ordering</b> <b>is</b> used to develop a median filter and colour morphological operations. A quantitative evaluation shows the pairwise vector median to be less effective for noise re-duction than the well known vector median filter, albeit with reduced complexity. Colour morphological erosions and di-lations based on the pairwise <b>ordering</b> <b>are</b> shown to pro-duce well behaved results that conform with expectations, {{without any of the}} problems associated with applying the operations to the individual channels. Their application to multiscale image analysis is also investigated. 1...|$|R
