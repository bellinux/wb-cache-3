5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This view {{is reinforced by the}} rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure in comparison to the immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware <b>of</b> <b>consequence.</b>|$|E

25|$|The 1920s were in {{many ways}} the apex of Leyendecker's career, with some of his most {{recognizable}} work being completed during this time. Modern advertising had come into its own, with Leyendecker widely regarded as among the preeminent American commercial artists. This popularity extended beyond the commercial, and into Leyendecker's personal life, where he and Charles Beach hosted large galas attended by people <b>of</b> <b>consequence</b> from all sectors. The parties they hosted at their New Rochelle home/studio were important social and celebrity making events.|$|E
25|$|Boulstred {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} her ancestors as a courtier. In 1605, she became part of the “entourage” of her mother’s first cousin Lucy Russell, the countess of Bedford. When King James I ascended the throne, the countess of Bedford became Queen Anna’s Lady of the Bedchamber. Boulstred and her sister Dorothy moved up with Lucy Russell, becoming Maidens of the Queen’s Bedchamber. There, Boulstred “became a noted wit in the court of James I.” As a good friend of the countess of Bedford and Handmaiden of the Queen, Boulstred was a lady <b>of</b> <b>consequence</b> at court.|$|E

25|$|A {{revision}} of the criminal code in 1957 {{made it possible to}} put aside prosecution of an illegal action that represented no danger to socialist society because of lack <b>of</b> <b>consequence.</b> This removed Paragraph 175 from the effective body of the law, because {{at the same time the}} East Berlin Court of Appeal (Kammergericht) decided that all punishments deriving from the old form of Paragraph 175 should be suspended due to the insignificance of the acts to which it had been applied. On this basis, homosexual acts between consenting adults ceased to be punished, beginning in the late 1950s.|$|E
25|$|En route home, {{with the}} {{decryption}} of the Japanese plan to invade Midway, Lent was reassigned {{to the second}} of three submarine patrol lines defending the island. His was one of eighteen boats around the island, which (except for Nautilus) accomplished nothing <b>of</b> <b>consequence</b> during the battle. Operating south of Nautilus, Lent picked up an 06.15 contact report of a force already out of reach. At 08.37, he surfaced and headed for Midway in hope of intercepting Japanese in retreat, but was forced to dive by American aircraft (still likely to attack, as Grayling learned), and quickly surfaced again to continue.|$|E
25|$|In July 1913 Rhys-Davids won his Division or Class, beating his nearest rival by 53 marks. In Eton terms, {{he was now}} {{considered}} a specialist. On 12 December 1915 he was nominated for the Newcastle (Domus Exhibition) Scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, and by 1916 was named Captain of the School. He was also inducted into the Eton Debating Society. As a person <b>of</b> <b>consequence</b> he was mentioned in The Eton Chronicle, the school's newspaper. On 7 April 1916 {{it was announced that}} Rhys-Davids had won the Newcastle scholarship. At this point, Rhys-Davids gave the first indication he was interested in becoming a pilot and joining the Royal Flying Corps (RFC).|$|E
40|$|The article {{examines}} {{the current state of}} the insurance system as a component <b>of</b> managing the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> emergencies. The researches are presented in the following areas: the insurance against accidents and fire risks and risks of natural disasters; property insurance (property, goods and agricultural products); the insurance of transport (by modes); liability insurance (by liability). So, the author made the statistical and analytical assessment <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> emergencies that was learned through the study of modern insurance system, which enabled to identify the complex of accounting objects in the management <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> emergencies...|$|R

Anticipation includes prediction <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> one's own proposed actions and prediction <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> probable actions by other entities.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, a Television Committee was formed; its {{goal was to}} set up an Irish {{television}} service with as little financial support from the government. It initially recommended setting up a service along the lines of ITV, using five mountain tops as transmission sites, which were also equipped for FM radio transmission. However, since Éamon de Valera was somewhat wary of television, nothing more <b>of</b> <b>consequence</b> was done until Seán Lemass succeeded him as Taoiseach in 1959. A year later, Radio Éireann was converted from an arm of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs into a semi-state body and given responsibility for television. Eamonn Andrews was appointed as the new chairman. A site for a new Television Production Centre had been found in 1959, and its construction started in October 1960.|$|E
25|$|Hadith are {{regarded}} by hadithists as important tools {{for understanding the}} Quran and commentaries (tafsir) written on it. Some important elements, which are today taken to be a long-held part of normative traditional Islamic practice and belief, for example, the detailed ritual practice of the five salat (obligatory Islamic prayers), are in fact {{not mentioned in the}} Qur'an at all, but are derived solely from the hadith. Hadithists, therefore, maintain that the ahadith are a necessary requirement for the true and proper practice of Islam, as it gives Muslims the nuanced details of Islamic practice and belief in areas where the Qur'an is silent. Quranists, on the contrary, hold the critical view on hadith that anything on which the Qur'an is silent is deliberate because Allah did not hold its detail to be <b>of</b> <b>consequence,</b> {{and in the case of}} ahadith that contradict the Qur'an, more so should those ahadith be forcefully rejected outright as a corruption of Islam.|$|E
25|$|L'Estocq's {{instructions}} {{called for}} him to mount a demonstration against Bernadotte's position. However, his adjutant Major Saint-Paul convinced him to order a full-scale assault. After the Spanden bridgehead was pounded by artillery for two hours, Rembow's Russian infantry advanced to the attack. The 27th Light Infantry, supported by four cannons and one howitzer, waited until the Russians were within close range before blasting them {{with a series of}} volleys. Shattered by the deadly fire, the Russians ran away, chased by the 17th Dragoons. L'Estocq admitted losing 500 killed and wounded, while the French claimed to have inflicted 700 to 800 casualties. The only French loss <b>of</b> <b>consequence</b> was Bernadotte, who was wounded in the head by a bullet and had to hand over command of the I Corps to General of Division Claude Perrin Victor. Also on the 5th, General of Division Pierre Dupont de l'Étang repelled a Prussian probe near Braunsberg.|$|E

25|$|In 1977, a {{committee}} reviewed all colleges of naturopathy in Australia and found that, although the syllabuses of many colleges were reasonable in their coverage of basic biomedical sciences on paper, the actual instruction bore little {{relationship to the}} documented course. In no case was any practical work <b>of</b> <b>consequence</b> available. The lectures which were attended by the committee varied from the dictation of textbook material to a slow, but reasonably methodical, exposition of the terminology of medical sciences, {{at a level of}} dictionary definitions, without the benefit of depth or the understanding of mechanisms or the broader significance of the concepts. The committee did not see any significant teaching of the various therapeutic approaches favoured by naturopaths. People reported to be particularly interested in homoeopathy, Bach's floral remedies or mineral salts were interviewed, but no systematic courses in the choice and use of these therapies were seen in the various colleges. The committee were left with the impression that the choice of therapeutic regime was based on the general whim of the naturopath and, since the suggested applications in the various textbooks and dispensations overlapped to an enormous extent, no specific indications were or could be taught.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the winter}} of 1691–92 the French devised a grand plan to gain the {{ascendancy}} over their enemies – a design for the invasion of England in one more effort to support James II in his attempts to regain his kingdoms; and a simultaneous assault on Namur in the Spanish Netherlands. The French hoped that Namur's seizure might inspire the Dutch to make peace, but if not, its capture would nevertheless be an important pawn at any future negotiations. With 60,000 men (protected by a similar force of observation under Luxembourg), Marshal Vauban invested the stronghold on 29 May. The town soon fell but the citadel – defended by van Coehoorn – held out until 30 June. Endeavouring to restore {{the situation in the}} Spanish Netherlands William III surprised Luxembourg's army near the village of Steenkirk on 3 August. The Allies enjoyed some initial success, but as French reinforcements came up William III's advance stalled. The Allies retired from the field in good order, and both sides claimed victory: the French because they repulsed the assault; the Allies because they had saved Liège from the same fate as Namur. However, {{due to the nature of}} late 17th century warfare the battle, like Fleurus before it, produced little <b>of</b> <b>consequence.</b> (See below).|$|E

500|$|A more {{moderate}} {{opinion of the}} album came from Jon Hadusek <b>of</b> <b>Consequence</b> of Sound.
