5|$|Between 1907 and 1917, the League for Women's Equal Rights was {{the most}} {{important}} feminist organization in Russia. Like the Russian Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society, it was focused on education and social welfare, but it also pushed for equal rights for women, including suffrage, equal inheritance, and an end to passport restrictions. The 1917 Revolution, catalyzed in part by women workers' demonstrations, generated a surge <b>of</b> <b>membership</b> <b>in</b> the organization. In the same year, because of the society's continued lobbying, Russia became the first major world power to grant women the right to vote.|$|E

5|$|Plans for the station's {{construction}} {{started in}} the early 1960s and negotiations between ESRO and Norwegian authorities started in 1964, despite Norway's lack <b>of</b> <b>membership</b> <b>in</b> ESRO. An initial disagreement of whether to locate the facility by Ny-Ålesund or Longyearbyen was overcome, and an agreement was signed on 14 December 1964. However, it was followed up by numerous protests from the Soviet Union, which claimed the installation would violate the demilitarized zone clause of the Svalbard Treaty, as the station {{had the potential to}} be used for military satellites and intelligence. The protests were rejected by Norwegian authorities, and construction started in May 1965. The Soviet Union attempted several inspections; one resulted in the crash of a Soviet helicopter. Operations commenced in 1967, but the facility was closed in 1974 as the facility was not suitable for new satellites with higher orbits.|$|E

25|$|Another way {{to think}} of the proof is that B, empty or non-empty, is always in the power set of A. For f to be onto, some element of A must map to B.

So the assumption that an element of A maps to B must be false; and f cannot be onto.|$|E
