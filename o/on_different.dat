5|$|Several {{times between}} 1978–89, the two wild-card games {{had to be}} played <b>on</b> <b>different</b> days. Normally they both would be held on Sunday. In 1983 and 1988, the games were split between Saturday and Monday because Sunday was Christmas, and the NFL had avoided playing on that day at the time. In 1984, both games were played in the Pacific Time Zone, {{so they had to}} be played on Saturday and Sunday to {{accommodate}} for time differences. In 1985, both the New York Giants and Jets hosted wild-card games. As they have shared a home stadium since 1984, the games had to be played <b>on</b> <b>different</b> days.|$|E

Uninvited, Sati reached the yajna-site, where Daksha ignored Sati and vilified Shiva. Unable to withstand this insult, Sati sacrificed herself in the fire. The wild, grief-stricken Shiva wandered the universe with her half-burnt corpse. Finally, Vishnu dismembered her body into 51 parts, each of which fell <b>on</b> <b>different</b> places on the earth, each creating a Shakti Pitha.|$|E

5|$|Antibody genes also re-organize in {{a process}} called class {{switching}} that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region.

5|$|Bioluminescent {{tissue in}} the mature fruit body is {{restricted}} {{to the edge of}} the gills (as well as the cross-veins that connect them), the junction of the gills with the stem, and the inrolled cap edge. Distribution of bioluminescence along the gill edge corresponds to the position of the cheilocystidia. Less than 10% of the light emitted from both the young and mature fruit bodies is from other tissues, including the fertile hymenial area and the stem. Fruit body luminescence is highly variable between fruit bodies found <b>on</b> <b>different</b> logs in different environments.|$|E
5|$|Born in Croydon, Cunningham was keen on {{entering}} the aviation {{industry as a}} teenager. Temporarily abiding his father's wishes to avoid the military, he approached the de Havilland company and was accepted as an engineering candidate. Concurrently, he joined the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and {{became a member of}} No. 604 (County of Middlesex) Squadron. Cunningham began his training in August 1935, flew solo in March 1936 and received his wings in 1937. He gradually became an established test pilot, gaining considerable flying time <b>on</b> <b>different</b> types of aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Both {{in water}} and on land, the newts are largely nocturnal. In their aquatic habitats, they hide under vegetation, and on land, they use {{structures}} such as logs, rocks, or small animal burrows for cover. They feed mainly <b>on</b> <b>different</b> invertebrates, but in the water may also prey on tadpoles and smaller newts. Predators include herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and various carnivorous mammals.|$|E

5|$|Bus {{services}} are provided to numerous stations. Most bus services provide feeding to the metro system where possible, {{and then do}} not continue into town.

5|$|By 1899, Waterloo had 16 {{platforms}} {{but only}} 10 numbers allocated in different {{sections of the}} station or <b>on</b> <b>different</b> levels; some numbers were duplicated. This complexity and confusion became the butt of jokes by writers and music hall comics {{for many years in}} the late 19th century, including Jerome K. Jerome in Three Men in a Boat. It was criticised and satirised in several Punch cartoons.|$|E
