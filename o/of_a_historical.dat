5|$|Despite {{arguments}} {{put forward}} by authors who have questioned the existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> Jesus, there remains a strong consensus in historical-critical biblical scholarship that a historical Jesus did live in that area {{and in that time}} period.|$|E
5|$|Rowan Atkinson and Richard Curtis {{developed}} {{the idea for}} the sitcom while working on Not the Nine O'Clock News.

5|$|Between 1841 and 1846, he {{published}} Beniowski, {{considered by some}} his best lyrical poetry. Starting as a story <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> figure, it developed into {{a discussion of the}} poet's own life and opinions. In 1842 he joined the religious-philosophical group, Koło Sprawy Bożej (Circle of God's Cause), led by Andrzej Towiański. This group included, among others, Mickiewicz. Towiański's influence is credited with a new, mystical current in Słowacki's works, seen in works such as the poem Beniowski and the drama Ksiądz Marek (Father Mark). Słowacki left the Circle a year later, in 1843.|$|E

5|$|Due to its {{criticism}} of Albrecht and the event it portrayed, the painting often {{is seen as}} strongly anti-Prussian. While it appears to glorify Poland, it is also critical of the country. Matejko went beyond portraying the glory <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> event and attempted to convey hints of how the country's history would play out in the future. This event was merely a hollow victory that failed to secure Poland's future. Matejko shows that the homage was an empty gesture {{and that it was}} Prussia that exploited it rather than Poland. Nobody in the painting is smiling except a lady of the court who is engaged in idle gossip.|$|E
5|$|Passed on June 26, 1991, the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the Lithuanian State Flag (Law No. I-1497) {{governs the}} design, sizes {{and use of}} the state flag.

5|$|Two {{approaches}} have dominated {{explanations of the}} story of the green children: that it is a folktale describing an imaginary encounter with the inhabitants of another world, perhaps subterranean or even extraterrestrial, or it is a garbled account <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> event. The story was praised as an ideal fantasy by the English anarchist poet and critic Herbert Read in his English Prose Style, published in 1931. It provided the inspiration for his only novel, The Green Child, written in 1934.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, Lawrence Johnson, {{a member}} of Waco's city council, viewed {{pictures}} of the Washington lynching at the National Civil Rights Museum, and began to lobby for {{a monument to the}} lynching. In 2002, Lester Gibson, another member of the city council, proposed that a plaque be installed at the courthouse where Washington was lynched. He further stated that the plaque should carry an apology from the city. The ideas were discussed, but proved unfruitful. In the 2000s, the idea of a memorial was revived by a McLennan County commissioner and the Waco Chamber of Commerce; the Waco Herald Tribune has editorialized in support <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> marker {{on the site of the}} lynching.
