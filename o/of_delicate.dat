5|$|Cotton was domesticated in India by 4000 BCE. Traditional Indian dress {{varies in}} colour and style across regions and depends on various factors, {{including}} climate and faith. Popular styles of dress include draped garments {{such as the}} sari for women and the dhoti or lungi for men. Stitched clothes, such as the shalwar kameez for women and kurta–pyjama combinations or European-style trousers and shirts for men, are also popular. Use <b>of</b> <b>delicate</b> jewellery, modelled on real flowers worn in ancient India, {{is part of a}} tradition dating back some 5,000 years; gemstones are also worn in India as talismans.|$|E
5|$|The {{basement}} {{contains the}} gunner's mess, canteen, No. 1 ancillary store, pantry and officer's kitchen. The canteen sold everyday necessities {{as well as}} a few items like biscuits, sweets and tobacco to the stationed troops. Profits from the canteen were used to fund sporting equipment for the garrison. The No.1 ancillary store was used for various pieces <b>of</b> <b>delicate</b> equipment, fuses, friction tubes and rockets. In 1887 an explosion in the room caused a number of injuries, damage to the store and to the above officer's quarters. The barracks room and officer's quarters are connected with a door, probably added in the 1930s as it {{is not part of the}} original plans. The barracks room accommodated approximately 20 men. For display purposes it is outfitted as for similar period barracks.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, {{the house}} had 16 {{bathrooms}} and 65 rooms, including 20 for servants. The house's main door opens into a square vaulted vestibule, walled throughout with highly polished yellow marble. It leads into the main hall, which is paneled to the ceiling in wood, painted white, the corners and angles accentuated by pilasters, and the rich mahogany doors encased within monumental frames. The white ceiling is intricately coffered. The hall has a large fireplace of carved white marble and a large table in the room's center, which was on a large red rug covering most of the floor. The main hall also featured Gobelins and Italian tapestries. The first floor also has an enfilade of three rooms: the green silk- and cedar-paneled living room, the white and gold drawing room, and the dark mahogany dining room. The three rooms have large doorways between them to allow hosts to combine rooms for a large event. The combined space has a span or linear distance of about 150 feet. A corridor connects the main hall to three rooms; it has recessed windows, dividing the corridor into bays. The corridor has pilasters and the same coffered ceiling of the main hall, and it used to have heavy velvet curtains at the window alcoves and entrance to the hallway; the windows had curtains <b>of</b> <b>delicate</b> salmon silk. The corridor originally displayed silk and velvet tapestries from {{various parts of the}} world.|$|E

5|$|Raising the Mary Rose meant {{overcoming}} {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>delicate</b> problems {{that had never}} been encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship Vasa 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since the hull was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under the hull and attached to two pontoons {{on either side of the}} ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the Mary Rose was intact and she lay deeply embedded in mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction of a cofferdam around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating sheerlegs attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.|$|E

25|$|Supercritical drying is {{a method}} of {{removing}} solvent without surface tension effects. As a liquid dries, the surface tension drags on small structures within a solid, causing distortion and shrinkage. Under supercritical conditions there is no surface tension, and the supercritical fluid can be removed without distortion. Supercritical drying is used for manufacture of aerogels and drying <b>of</b> <b>delicate</b> materials such as archeological samples and biological samples for electron microscopy.

25|$|In Ong Kian Cheong, District Judge Neighbour {{stated that}} while {{people may have}} a desire to profess and spread their faith, the right to {{propagate}} such opinions cannot be unfettered.

Furthermore, in distributing the seditious and offensive tracts to spread their faith, the accused persons used the postal service to achieve their purpose and so were shielded by anonymity until {{the time they were}} apprehended. There is no doubt that this must have made it difficult for the police to trace them. In view of these circumstances, his Honour found that custodial sentences were warranted for both accused persons.|$|E

25|$|In 1874 Paz’s brother King Alfonso XII was {{restored}} to the throne in place of their mother Queen Isabella II. Three years later, Paz returned to Spain with her sisters Pilar and Eulalia. She lived at first in El Escorial with her mother, but later moved to the Alcázar of Seville. When Isabella II returned to live permanently in Paris, Paz and her sisters moved to the Royal Palace of Madrid with their brother King Alfonso XII. The education and care of the three young infantas was placed {{under the supervision of}} their eldest sister Infanta Isabel. Paz was particularly close to her sister Pilar, who was only one year older. In 1879, Pilar, who was <b>of</b> <b>delicate</b> health, died suddenly while the sisters were {{in the small town of}} Escoriaza. Paz, who was seventeen at the time, was deeply affected by the death of her sister.|$|E
25|$|CFCs {{were invented}} by Thomas Midgley, Jr. in the 1920s. They {{were used in}} air {{conditioning}} and cooling units, as aerosol spray propellants prior to the 1970s, and in the cleaning processes <b>of</b> <b>delicate</b> electronic equipment. They also occur as by-products of some chemical processes. No significant natural sources have ever been identified for these compounds—their presence in the atmosphere is due almost entirely to human manufacture. As mentioned above, when such ozone-depleting chemicals reach the stratosphere, they are dissociated by ultraviolet light to release chlorine atoms. The chlorine atoms act as a catalyst, and each can break down {{tens of thousands of}} ozone molecules before being removed from the stratosphere. Given the longevity of CFC molecules, recovery times are measured in decades. It is calculated that a CFC molecule takes an average of about five to seven years to go from the ground level up to the upper atmosphere, and it can stay there for about a century, destroying up to one hundred thousand ozone molecules during that time..|$|E
25|$|Leedsichthys fossils {{have been}} {{difficult}} to interpret because the skeletons were not completely made of bone. Large parts consisted of cartilage that did not fossilize. On several occasions the enigmatic large partial remains have been mistaken for stegosaurian dinosaur bones. As the vertebrae are among the parts that have not been preserved, it is hard to determine the total body length. Estimates have varied wildly. At {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century a length of nine metres (thirty feet) was seen as plausible, but by its end Leedsichthys was sometimes claimed to have been over thirty metres (hundred feet) long. Recent research has lowered this to about sixteen metres (fifty feet) for the largest individuals. Skull bones have been found indicating that Leedsichthys had a large head with bosses on the skull roof. Fossilised bony fin rays show large elongated pectoral fins and a tall vertical tail fin. The gill arches were lined by gill rakers, equipped by a unique system <b>of</b> <b>delicate</b> bone plates, that filtered plankton from the sea water, the main food source.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1960s Larry Poons whose earlier Dot {{paintings}} {{were associated with}} Op Art began to produce looser and more free formed paintings that were referred to as his Lozenge Ellipse paintings of 1967-1968. Along with John Hoyland, Walter Darby Bannard, Larry Zox, Ronald Davis, Ronnie Landfield, John Seery, Pat Lipsky, Dan Christensen and several other young painters a new movement that related to Color Field painting began to form; eventually called Lyrical Abstraction. The late 1960s saw painters turning to surface inflection, deep space depiction, and painterly touch and paint handling merging with the language of color. Among {{a new generation of}} abstract painters who emerged combining color field painting with expressionism the older generation also began infusing new elements of complex space and surface into their works. By the 1970s Poons created thick-skinned, cracked and heavy paintings referred to as Elephant Skin paintings; while Christensen sprayed loops, colored webs of lines and calligraphy, across multi-colored fields <b>of</b> <b>delicate</b> grounds; Ronnie Landfield's stained band paintings are reflections of both Chinese landscape painting and the Color Field idiom and John Seery stained painting as exemplified by East, 1973, from the National Gallery of Australia. Poons, Christensen, Davis, Landfield, Seery, Lipsky, Zox and several others created paintings that bridge Color Field painting with Lyrical Abstraction and underscore a re-emphasis on landscape, gesture and touch.|$|E
25|$|It {{should always}} be borne in mind that color was the keynote of this scheme. The custom was {{practically}} universal, and enough traces remain to show how splendid was {{the effect of these}} old Gothic churches and cathedrals. The priests in their gorgeous vestments, the lights, the crucifix, the banners and incense, the frescoed or diapered walls, and that crowning glory of Gothic art, the stained glass, were all in harmony with these beautiful schemes of colored carved work. Red, blue, green, white and gilding were the tints as a rule used. Not only were the screens painted in colors, but the parts painted white were often further decorated with delicate lines and sprigs of foliage in conventional pattern. The plain surfaces of the panels were also adorned with saints, often on a background <b>of</b> <b>delicate</b> gesso diaper, colored or gilded (Southwold). Nothing could exceed the beauty of the triptychs or retables of Germany, Flanders or France; carved with scenes from the New Testament in high relief arranged under a delicate lacework of canopies and clustered pinnacles glistening with gold and brilliant colors. In Germany the effect was further enhanced by emphasizing parts of the gilding by means of a transparent varnish tinted with red or green, thus giving a special tone to the metallic luster.|$|E
25|$|Imonida, {{the love}} of Oroonoko’s life, is a {{beautiful}} African woman who is sold into slavery after Oroonoko attempts to rescue her. When Oroonoko meets Imonida, they instantly fall in love. His first encounter with her is described as, “a beauty, that to describe her truly she was female to the noble male, the beautiful black Venus to our young Mars, as charming in her person as he, and <b>of</b> <b>delicate</b> virtues” (Behn, 9). Oroonoko is smitten by her, instantly asks her for her hand in marriage, and without hesitation she agrees. Although the African tradition of having more than one wife is still prevalent during this time, Oroonoko assures Imonida that he will never take on another wife. It {{is evident in the}} novella that Oroonoko and Imonida’s love for one another is unconditional. Once the King, Oroonoko’s grandfather, hears different rumors of how beautiful Imoinda is, he becomes adamant on making her one of his women. Despite his grandson’s deep affection and love for Imonida, the King gives her a royal veil which officially marks Imoinda as one of the King’s women. This is an honor that is nearly impossible to refuse and Oroonoko is angered by his grandfather’s actions. Imonida becomes a vital character by becoming the heart and center of this tragic travel narrative alongside Oroonko. Her beauty, strength, and flawless characteristics attract Oroonoko, the King, and even the reader for that matter. Oroonoko and Imoinda were constantly being separated once Imoinda gets sold into slavery. Regardless of how long they were a part, their love remained strong and eventually they are reunited. This never ending love between Oroonoko and Imoinda is evident throughout the novella. Both characters are willing to announce their love, make brutal sacrifices, and remain passionate for one another which helps solidify the strength of their unconditional love.|$|E
