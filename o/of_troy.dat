5|$|In 1869, the City <b>of</b> <b>Troy</b> {{bought the}} {{property}} of the Third Street Burying Ground for the site of a new city hall. This was the burial site for many of Troy's earliest inhabitants; the City had bought lot number 102 in Section N for re-interment of 146 graves. The Vanderheyden family and Jacob Lansing, founders <b>of</b> <b>Troy</b> and Lansingburgh respectively, were re-interred in Oakwood from private, family cemeteries. With these re-interments, the graves within Oakwood span the entire the history <b>of</b> <b>Troy.</b> Although it was a cemetery by definition, Oakwood quickly became a place for recreation and was used in its early days as a public park. In response to its popularity, many memorials include benches in their design, aimed to invite visitors to rest while enjoying their visit. So popular was Oakwood that in 1908 the Association began a stage service between the Oakwood Avenue and 114th Street entrances.|$|E

5|$|The Firebrand is an 1987 {{historical}} fantasy {{novel by}} American author Marion Zimmer Bradley. Set {{in the ancient}} city <b>of</b> <b>Troy,</b> the novel is a re-telling of Homer's epic poem, the Iliad. The Firebrand is written {{from the point of}} view of Kassandra, the prophet daughter of King Priam <b>of</b> <b>Troy,</b> and also features other prominent characters from Greek mythology. As in the Iliad, Kassandra foresees catastrophe for her city but few pay heed to her warnings. In Bradley's story, Kassandra is presented as a strong and insightful woman, rather than as a sufferer of insanity.|$|E

5|$|In {{the tales}} of heroic Greece, royal {{succession}} often passed from father-in-law to son-in-law, and some historians have seen in this an early example of the epikleros pattern. Some examples include Pelops, Bellerophon, Melampus, Peleus, Telamon, and Diomedes. Not all such heroic era royal successions followed the epikleros pattern however, {{as in the case}} of Menelaus, who married Helen <b>of</b> <b>Troy</b> and succeeded Helen's father Tyndareus, even though Tyndareus had living sons, Kastor and Polydeukes. Another example is Arete of Phaeacia in the Odyssey, who was an heiress married to her father's brother Alcinous.|$|E
