25|$|Under the 2005 {{revisions}} of IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry, {{there is no}} single correct name for every compound. The primary function of chemical nomenclature is to ensure that each name refers, unambiguously, to a single substance. It is considered less important to ensure that each substance should have a single unambiguous name, although the number of acceptable names is limited. Water is one acceptable name for this compound, even though it is neither a systematic nor an international name and is specific to just one phase of the compound (its liquid form). The other IUPAC recommendation is <b>oxidane,</b> which is used by hoax industry groups promoting DHMO as a safe industrial chemical while hinting at dangers and government conspiracies.|$|E

50|$|Hydrogen polyoxides (also {{known as}} <b>oxidanes,</b> oxohydrogens, or oxyhydrogens) are {{chemical}} compounds that consist only of {{hydrogen and oxygen}} atoms, are bonded exclusively by single bonds (i.e., they are saturated), and are acyclic (have molecular structures containing no cycles or loops). They can, therefore, be classed as hydrogen chalcogenides.|$|R
50|$|Examples of {{mononuclear}} parent hydrides (with {{a single}} skeletal atom) are:BH3 (borane), CH4 (methane; not carbane!), SiH4 (silane), NH3 (azane), PH3 (phosphane), H2S (sulfane) and H2O (<b>oxidane).</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{accepted}} IUPAC name {{of water}} is <b>oxidane</b> or simply water, or its equivalent in different languages, although there are other systematic names {{which can be used}} to describe the molecule. <b>Oxidane</b> is only intended to be used as the name of the mononuclear parent hydride used for naming derivatives of water by substituent nomenclature. These derivatives commonly have other recommended names. For example, the name hydroxyl is recommended over oxidanyl for the -OH group. The name oxane is explicitly mentioned by the IUPAC as being unsuitable for this purpose, since it is already the name of a cyclic ether also known as tetrahydropyran.|$|E

50|$|This naming method {{generally}} follows established IUPAC organic nomenclature. Hydrides of {{the main}} group elements (groups 13-17) are given -ane base names, e.g. borane, BH3.

The compound PCl3 would thus be named substitutively as trichlorophosphane (with chlorine [...] "substituting"). However, not all such names (or stems) are derived from the element name. For example, NH3 is called [...] "azane".|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} among urinary dopamine levels, arterial {{blood pressure and}} kidney monoanine <b>oxidane</b> activity was studied in hypertensive rats. The rats were rendered hypertensive by two operations: right nephrectomy followed in two weeks by contralateral renal arterial compression. The blood pressures rose steadily throughout the first 11 weeks following the second operation {{and at the end}} of this period leveled off at approximately 180 - 185 mm Hg. Dopamine was extracted from pooled urine samples by ion exchange techniques and measured by spectrofluorimetric methods. Dopamine levels (means from pooled group data) rose throughout the experimental period from a control value of 675 ± 166 μg/ 1 to 1022 ± 449 μg/ 1. The rising pattern of dopamine was interrupted by sharp decreases during the eleventh and thirteenth weeks. A linear correlation, excluding control values and values from the last week of the investigation, was conducted by regressing blood pressure on logarithm dopamine concentration. The analysis which was valid only for dopamine concentration ranging from 500 - 1000 μg/ 1 resulted in a regression coefficient of 0. 85 and a coefficient of determination of 0. 72 indicating a fair degree of linear association between the two variables. Monoamine oxidase activity dropped off sharply following the second operation, went through what appeared to be a compensatory rise, and then decreased to 40 percent of its original activity at the end of the investigational period. In considering the inter{{relationship among}} the three variables, a definite correlation between dopamine and the blood pressure was shown to exist, however, a clear relationship between dopamine and monoamine oxidase inhibition was not established...|$|E
