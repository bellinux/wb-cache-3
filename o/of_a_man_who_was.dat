5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{investigate}} the fatal shooting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> apparently killed for a $1.49 pen. Lewis believes {{there must be}} more to the story, refusing to believe a pen is worth killing for. When they search suspect Mitchell Forman's (Sal S. Koussa) apartment, they find thousands of pens, many of which line the walls like bizarre decorations. Lewis later finds Forman at the police station, where he originally planned to turn himself in, but instead {{went up to the}} roof to commit suicide. Lewis lures Forman away from the ledge by enticing him with a beautiful golden pen, which belonged to Lewis' deceased grandmother. Forman is taken into custody. Later, Lewis still cannot believe someone would kill over a pen, but Gee (Yaphet Kotto) suggests it is no worse than killing over a car or woman. Lewis, determined not to develop such a strong attachment to a material item, gives his grandmother's pen to Felton (Daniel Baldwin).|$|E
5|$|On 7 March 2009 the RIRA claimed {{responsibility}} for the 2009 Massereene Barracks shooting. This shooting occurred outside the Massereene Barracks as four soldiers were receiving a pizza delivery. Two soldiers were killed, and the other two soldiers and two deliverymen were injured. On 3 April 2009 the RIRA in Derry {{claimed responsibility}} for carrying out a punishment shooting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> awaiting sentencing for raping a 15-year-old girl. The RIRA were also blamed for orchestrating rioting in the Ardoyne area of Belfast on 13 July 2009 as an Apprentice Boys parade was passing. Several PSNI officers were injured in the rioting and at least one shot was fired at police. In early November, the Independent Monitoring Commission released a report stating that the threat from the RIRA and other dissident republicans was at its most serious level since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.|$|E

25|$|Chad died on 2 March 672, and {{was buried}} at the Church of Saint Mary which later {{became part of}} the cathedral at Lichfield. Bede relates the death story as that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> already {{regarded}} as a saint. In fact, Bede has stressed throughout his narrative that Chad's holiness communicated across boundaries of culture and politics, to Theodore, for example, in his own lifetime. The death story is clearly of supreme importance to Bede, confirming Chad's holiness and vindicating his life. The account occupies considerably more space in Bede's account than all the rest of Chad's ministry in Northumbria and Mercia together.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to Ovid, other Roman writers also mentioned lycanthropy. Virgil wrote {{of human beings}} transforming into wolves. Pliny the Elder relates two tales of lycanthropy. Quoting Euanthes, he mentions a man who hung his clothes on an ash tree and swam across an Arcadian lake, transforming him into a wolf. On the condition that he attack no human being for nine years, he {{would be free to}} swim back across the lake to resume human form. Pliny also quotes Agriopas regarding a tale <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> turned into a wolf after tasting the entrails of a human child, but was restored to human form 10 years later.|$|E
25|$|However, {{after the}} {{adoption}} of Islam, bidadari is equated with houri, the heavenly maiden mentioned in the Quran, in which God stated that the 'forbidden pearls' of heaven are for those men who have resisted temptation and borne life's trials. Islam spread in the Malay archipelago when Arabic traders came to trade spices with the Malays; at that time, Hinduism {{formed the basis of}} the Malay culture, but syncretism with the Islamic religion and culture spawned the idea of a Bidadari. It is usually seen as a prized offer to those who lived a lifestyle in service to and pleasing to God; after death, the Bidadari was the man's wife or wives, depending on what type of person he was. The worthiness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> offered Bidadari depended upon his holiness: how often he prayed, how much he turned away from the 'outside world', and how little he heeded worldly desires.|$|E

500|$|Lafayette {{became an}} American icon {{in part because}} he was not {{associated}} with any particular region of the country: he was of foreign birth, did not live in America, and had fought in New England, the Mid-Atlantic states, and the South. Thus, he was a unifying figure. His role in the French Revolution, in which he was seen by Americans as steering a middle course, enhanced this popularity. [...] Americans were naturally sympathetic to a republican cause, but also remembered Louis XVI as a friend of the nascent United States. [...] When Lafayette fell from power in 1792, Americans tended to blame factionalism for the ouster <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>was,</b> in their eyes, above such things.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with London's Evening Standard in January 2013, Anthony Hopkins (who played the eponymous role in the 2012 Alfred Hitchcock biopic Hitchcock) questioned The Girls portrayal of the director {{and the need for}} a film about that period of Hitchcock's career: [...] "I talked to Tippi Hedren one day...and she never mentioned that...Whatever his obsession was, she didn't want to dwell on it...I don't think it's necessary to put all that into a movie." [...] Speaking to The Independent later that month, Hitchcock director Sacha Gervasi said, [...] " [...] seems a rare one-note portrayal <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> a little more complex than that. A lot of people, who were there, do not recognise this portrayal of him as this monster". Danny Huston, who played screenwriter Whitfield Cook in Hitchcock, told WENN.com that he believed Hitchcock would not have contested Hedren's account of him: [...] "Hitchcock was such a deliciously dark character that I don't think he would dismiss what Tippi was saying as not true." ...|$|E
500|$|Hitler {{had a few}} brief {{relationships}} when young. He {{was deeply}} attached to his half-niece Geli Raubal, 19 years his junior. She began living at his residence after her mother became Hitler's housekeeper in 1925. Although the exact {{nature and extent of}} their relationship is unknown, Kershaw describes it as a latent [...] "sexual dependence". It was rumoured among contemporaries that they were in a romantic relationship. Geli committed suicide with Hitler's gun in his Munich apartment in September 1931. Her death was a source of deep, lasting pain for Hitler. Ernst Hanfstaengl, {{one of the members of}} Hitler's inner circle in the early years in Munich, wrote that [...] "I felt Hitler was a case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> neither fish, flesh nor fowl, neither fully homosexual nor fully heterosexual... I had formed the firm conviction that he was impotent, the repressed, masturbating type." [...] Nevertheless, Hanfstaengl was convinced enough of Hitler's heterosexuality that he unsuccessfully tried to encourage a romantic relationship between Hitler and Martha Dodd, daughter of the American ambassador. According to Hanfstaengl, filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl tried to begin a relationship with Hitler early on, but he turned her down.|$|E

500|$|As Bambi {{continues}} to age, he begins {{spending most of}} his time alone, including avoiding Faline though he still loves her in a melancholic way. Several times he meets with the old Prince who teaches him about snares, shows him how to free another animal from one, and encourages him not to use trails, to avoid the traps of men. When Bambi is later shot by a hunter, the Prince shows him how to walk in circles to confuse the man and his dogs until the bleeding stops, then takes him to a safe place to recover. They remain together until Bambi is strong enough to leave the safe haven again. When Bambi has grown gray and is [...] "old", the old Prince shows him that man is not all-powerful by showing him the dead body <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> shot and killed by another man. When Bambi confirms that he now understands that [...] "He" [...] is not all-powerful, and that there is [...] "Another" [...] over all creatures, the stag tells him that he has always loved him and calls him [...] "my son" [...] before leaving to die.|$|E
500|$|He {{continued}} {{for several years}} to try to become a published author. His diaries, which he began in 1923 and {{continued for}} the rest of his life, provided an outlet for his desire to write. The lack of income from his literary works (he wrote two plays in 1923, neither of which sold) forced him to take jobs as a caller on the stock exchange and as a bank clerk in Cologne, a job he detested. He was dismissed from the bank in August 1923 and returned to Rheydt. During this period, he read avidly and was influenced by the works of Oswald Spengler, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the British-born German writer whose book The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century (1899) was one of the standard works of the extreme right in Germany. He also began to study the [...] "social question" [...] and read the works of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, August Bebel and Gustav Noske. According to German historian Peter Longerich, Goebbels' diary entries from late 1923 to early 1924 reflected the writings <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> isolated, preoccupied by [...] "religious-philosophical" [...] issues, and lacked a sense of direction. Diary entries of mid-December 1923 forward show Goebbels was moving towards the vÃ¶lkisch nationalist movement.|$|E
500|$|According to Saadiq, {{the opening}} track [...] "Thinking of You" [...] is [...] "a really soul, southern, funky song" [...] {{inspired}} by Al Green. It has light guitar strokes and is sung in a Southern twang by Saadiq, while [...] "Top Notch" [...] features jazz elements and the vocalist's playful {{promise of a}} trip to Denny's for [...] "the most expensive dinner we can find". On [...] "Still a Man", he sings from the perspective <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> left by his wife {{to raise their children}} alone. The backing vocalists sing the meditative hook, [...] "Have you ever loved somebody / Who loves you so much it hurts you to hurt them so bad?" [...] On [...] "Holy Smokes & Gee Whiz", Saadiq's older brother Randall Wiggins sings lead. The song was described by Washington City Paper journalist Rickey Wright as a modernized version of the Stylistics' 1972 song [...] "Betcha by Golly, Wow", featuring [...] "a dead-on impression of Russell Thompkins' unmistakable falsetto and precise diction". [...] "Annie May" [...] was written by Wiggins as a story about a [...] "good girl next door" [...] who becomes an exotic dancer, while [...] "Let Me Know" [...] is a love song with Wall of Sound elements. According to Nick Krewen of The Spectator, [...] "Wild Child" [...] is [...] "a ballad in the grand sense" [...] of the 1977 Earth, Wind & Fire song [...] "Be Ever Wonderful". [...] "Party Don't Cry" [...] is a meditation on mortality with jazzy, philosophical overtones. Wright believed the song [...] "expresses an overt spirituality unheard in the Tonyies' past songs". The closing track is a gospel-influenced instrumental and variation of [...] "Lovin' You" [...] composed by Saadiq. Its sole lyric, according to Wright, is an universalist platitude.|$|E
