25|$|Pure monocrystalline silicon is used {{to produce}} silicon wafers used in the {{semiconductor}} industry, in electronics, and in some high-cost and high-efficiency photovoltaic applications. Pure silicon is an intrinsic semiconductor, which means that unlike metals, it conducts electron holes and electrons released from atoms by heat; silicon's electrical conductivity increases with higher temperatures. Pure silicon has too low a conductivity (i.e., too high a resistivity) {{to be used as}} a circuit element in electronics. In practice, pure silicon is doped with small concentrations of certain other elements, which greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by controlling the number and charge (positive or negative) of activated carriers. Such control is necessary for transistors, solar cells, semiconductor detectors, and <b>other</b> <b>semiconductor</b> <b>devices</b> used in the computer industry and other technical applications.

40|$|We give a {{theoretical}} {{interpretation of the}} noise properties of Schottky barrier diodes based on {{the role played by}} the long range Coulomb interaction. We show that at low bias Schottky diodes display shot noise because the presence of the depletion layer makes negligible the effects of the Coulomb interaction on the current fluctuations. When the device passes from barrier to flat band conditions, the Coulomb interaction becomes active, thus introducing correlation between different current fluctuations. Therefore, the cross-over between shot and thermal noise represents the suppression due to long range Coulomb interaction of the otherwise full shot-noise. Similar ideas can be used to interpret the noise properties of <b>others</b> <b>semiconductor</b> <b>devices.</b> Comment: 3 page...|$|R

In normal operation the base-emitter junction does indeed form a diode, but in most cases it is undesirable for the base-collector junction to behave as a diode. If a sufficient forward bias is placed on this junction it will form a parasitic diode structure, and current will flow from base to collector.|$|R

40|$|Optimizing the {{efficiency}} and dynamics of power converters is a critical tradeoff in power electronics. The increase of switching frequency can improve the dynamics of power converters, but theefficiency may be degraded {{as well as the}} switching losses.

40|$|Electro-thermal {{simulations}} of a PIN-diode {{based on the}} finite-element method, show a non-uniform temperature distribution inside the device during switching transients. Hence, the implicit assumption of a uniform temperature distribution when coupling an analytical electrical model and a thermal model yields inaccurate electro-thermal behaviour of the PIN-diode so far. The idea of including non-uniform temperature distribution into power <b>semiconductor</b> <b>device</b> models is not new, as accurate electro-thermal simulations are required for designing compact power electronic systems (as IC or MCM). Instead of using a one-dimensional finite difference or element method, the bond graphs and the hydrodynamic method are utilized to build an electro-thermal model of the PIN-diode. The results obtained by this original technique are compared with those obtained by a commercial finite-element simulator. The results are similar but the computation effort of the proposed technique is {{a fraction of that}} required by finite-element simulators.
