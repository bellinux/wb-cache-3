5|$|After the Anschluss, the Austrian SS was {{folded into}} SS-Oberabschnitt Donau. The third {{regiment}} of the SS-Verfügungstruppe (Der Führer) {{and the fourth}} Totenkopf regiment (Ostmark) were recruited in Austria shortly thereafter. On Heydrich's orders, mass arrests of potential enemies of the Reich began immediately after the Anschluss. Mauthausen was the first concentration camp opened in Austria following the Anschluss. Before {{the invasion of the}} Soviet Union, Mauthausen was the harshest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> in the Greater German Reich.|$|E
5|$|The first camp {{opened on}} May 15, 1941 near Baltimore, Maryland. A total of 152 camps and units were {{established}} {{over the next}} six years. The federal government provided work projects, housing, camp furnishings and paid for transportation to the camps. The responsibilities of the churches included day-to-day management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps,</b> subsistence costs, meals and healthcare for the men. When the young men arrived at the first camps, they started a six-month experiment that would extend to six years.|$|E
5|$|Butlin's {{inspiration}} for his holiday empire {{had come from}} a holiday to Barry Island in his twenties, when he had been locked out of his B all day by his landlady. He finally decided to build the last and smallest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> there in 1965. Butlin took out a 99-year lease on the headland at Nell's Point, Barry Island, in 1966. Building work began there in the winter and the gates opened to campers on 18 June 1966. Butlin retired in 1969 and the Barry Island camp was the last opening under his management.|$|E
50|$|On July 12, after {{a lull in}} the fighting, the Lebanese army {{launched}} a new assault, towards <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> where <b>the</b> last battle positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Islamists were. They resumed with <b>the</b> bombardment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> and troops engaged the militants in heavy street fighting. 33 soldiers were killed and 93 wounded during the fighting among <b>the</b> ruins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> where <b>the</b> Islamist fighters were well dug in and large parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> were also booby-trapped.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the regular staff, Ramah Poconos, together with the Jewish Agency for Israel, brings 40-50 Israeli staff members to camp each summer. These Israelis are a full part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> and participate in all areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> By contributing to <b>the</b> immersive environment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> Israeli staff members enhance <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> Jewish education at Ramah Poconos.|$|R

5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members in and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps,</b> partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS {{knew what was going}} on inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disbanding}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps,</b> {{the defeated}} {{forces of the}} former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign into Rwanda from North Kivu. The insurgents maintained a presence in Rwanda's north western provinces and were supported by the predominantly Hutu population, {{many of whom had}} lived in the refugee camps before they were attacked. In addition to supporting the wars in the Congo, Kagame began a propaganda campaign to bring the Hutu to his side. He integrated former soldiers of the deposed genocidal regime's military into the RPF-dominated national army and appointed senior Hutu to key local government positions in the areas hit by insurgency. These tactics were eventually successful; by 1999, the population in the north west had stopped supporting the insurgency and the insurgents were mostly defeated.|$|E
5|$|Kagame first {{provided}} {{troops and}} military training to aid a rebellion against Zaire by the Banyamulenge, a Tutsi group living near Bukavu in the Zairian South Kivu province. With Rwandan army support, the Banyamulenge defeated local {{security forces and}} began attacking the Hutu refugee camps in the area. At the same time, Kagame's forces joined with Zairian Tutsi around Goma to attack two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> there. Most refugees from the attacked camps moved to the large Mugunga camp. In November 1996 the Rwandan army attacked Mugunga, causing an estimated 800,000 refugees to flee. Many returned to Rwanda {{despite the presence of}} the RPF; others ventured further west into Zaire.|$|E

At the same time, the Greek cavalry, supported by 8,000 hoplites will engage the Carthaginians on <b>the</b> northern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b>|$|R
25|$|On November 20, 1862, Colonel Daniel Cameron, who {{had been}} in brief command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> earlier in <b>the</b> year, and had been among the parolees, again took command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Few traces remain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> <b>The</b> barracks and {{barbed wire}} have disappeared. The most {{significant}} vestige <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> {{today is a}} carved rock that depicts a soldier {{with a gun and}} the dates 1789 and 1939, marking <b>the</b> 150th anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Revolution. A nearby rock bears the inscription [...] "Gierke, Walter," [...] a former internee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> who may have sculpted the memorial.|$|R
5|$|Mennonite Central Committee, American Friends Service Committee and Brethren Service Committee {{administered}} {{almost all}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b> The Association of Catholic Conscientious Objectors managed four camps and the Methodist World Peace Commission two. Each camp {{was assigned a}} director responsible for supervising camp operation. The director managed {{the needs of the}} men, oversaw maintenance of the camp facilities, handled community relations and reported to Selective Service officials. Initially a pastor had the camp director role. Later, capable men from among the CPS workers directed the camps.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} from Arabia, Khalid {{received}} intelligence entailing a concentration of a large Persian army and Christian Arab auxiliaries. These forces were based in four different camps in the Euphrates region at Hanafiz, Zumail, Saniyy and the largest being at Muzayyah. Khalid avoided a pitched battle with a large united Persian force and decided to attack and destroy each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> in a separate night attacks from three sides. He divided his army in three units, and attacked the Persian forces in coordinated assaults from three different directions during the night, starting from the Battle of Muzayyah, then the Battle of Saniyy, and finally the Battle of Zumail in November 633 AD.|$|E
5|$|Sri Lankan Tamils in India {{are mostly}} {{refugees}} of about over 100,000 in special camps and another 50,000 outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b> In western European countries, the refugees and immigrants have integrated themselves into society where permitted. Tamil British singer M.I.A (born Mathangi Arulpragasam) and BBC journalist George Alagiah are, among others, notable people of Sri Lankan Tamil descent. Sri Lankan Tamil Hindus {{have built a}} number of prominent Hindu temples across North America and Europe, notably in Canada, France, Germany, Denmark, and the UK.|$|E
5000|$|The 2/11th Battalion {{arrived at}} <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> on 15 December 1939 and were later {{joined by the}} 2/10th Battalion. <b>The</b> <b>camp</b> {{facilities}} were expanded during the war, with two parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> known as [...] "Chocolate City", due to the brown-coloured oiled timber weatherboard buildings in that part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> and [...] "Silver City", due to corrugated iron Nissen huts built in that part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> Citizens Military Force units were also trained at <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> with up to 60,000 Australian soldiers trained during World War II.|$|R
50|$|By July 20, only 300 square yards {{had been}} left in <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Islamists in <b>the</b> {{southern}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> <b>The</b> army's advance was slowed down until {{they were able to}} defuse dozens of booby-traps left in <b>the</b> ruins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> by <b>the</b> Islamists.|$|R
5000|$|April 1943: Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> {{is turned}} into a {{hospital}} for POWs. <b>The</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> is separated and {{taken over by the}} SS to house Jews ostensibly for shipment overseas in exchange for German civilians.|$|R
5|$|Finally, in November 1945, Cariappa {{was made}} the {{commander}} of the Bannu Frontier Brigade in Waziristan. It was during this time that Colonel Ayub Khan – later Field Marshal and President of Pakistan (1962–1969) – served under him. Unlike previous British commanders who tried to keep the local tribes under control by force, Cariappa tried a different approach by extending them friendly relations which worked well. When Head of the Interim Government, Jawaharlal Nehru, visited Bannu he found it extremely peaceful and settled, compared to Razmak where another brigade was stationed. Nehru was impressed by Cariappa's way of dealing with the tribes. He was also widely acclaimed for his treatment of the Indian National Army's (INA) prisoners. When Cariappa visited one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> that held INA prisoners, he was moved by the conditions in which they lived. He immediately wrote to the Adjutant General recommending that their living conditions be improved and to pardon some of those who were not guilty. These included Colonel Prem Kumar Sahgal, Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Shah Nawaz Khan. Cariappa pointed out that these prisoners had considerable support from the Indian leaders, who would later rule the country. This led the British to release most of the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|In March 1933, {{less than}} three months after the Nazis seized power, Himmler set up the first {{official}} concentration camp at Dachau. Hitler had stated {{that he did not want}} it to be just another prison or detention camp. Himmler appointed Theodor Eicke, a convicted felon and ardent Nazi, to run the camp in June 1933. Eicke devised a system that was used as a model for future camps throughout Germany. Its features included isolation of victims from the outside world, elaborate roll calls and work details, the use of force and executions to exact obedience, and a strict disciplinary code for the guards. Uniforms were issued for prisoners and guards alike; the guards' uniforms had a special Totenkopf (death's head) insignia on their collars. By the end of 1934, Himmler took control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> under the aegis of the SS, creating a separate division, the SS-Totenkopfverbände.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941 the VuWHA {{founded the}} Deutsche Ausrüstungswerke GmbH (German Equipment Works; DAW), {{which was created}} to {{integrate}} the SS business enterprises with the burgeoning concentration camp system. Himmler subsequently established four major new concentration camps in 1941: Auschwitz, Gross-Rosen, Natzweiler-Struthof, and Neuengamme. Each {{had at least one}} factory or quarry nearby where the inmates were forced to work. Himmler took a particular interest in providing laborers for IG Farben, which was constructing a synthetic rubber factory at Auschwitz III–Monowitz. The plant was almost ready to commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945. Life expectancy of inmates at Monowitz averaged about three months. This was typical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps,</b> as inmates were underfed and lived under disastrously bad living conditions. Their workload was intentionally made impossibly high, under the policy of extermination through labor.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the arrival}} of other units from Force 134, {{as well as the}} Headquarters of Allied Forces, Norway, Major General Urquhart and his {{headquarters}} staff had complete control over all Norwegian activities. This meant that it was Urquhart who welcomed Crown Prince Olaf of Norway and three ministers representing the Norwegian Government when they arrived on a Royal Navy cruiser, and the division also took part in the celebrations when King Haakon VII of Norway returned to his country from exile. Other duties for the division included rounding up war criminals, ensuring that German troops were confined to their camps and reservations and, with Royal Engineer assistance, clearing buildings of mines and other boobytraps. They were also given the responsibility of assisting Allied personnel who had, until the German surrender, been prisoners of war in Norway, a large number of whom were Russian. There were more than 80,000 Russian ex-prisoners of war, and many needed medical treatment because of the inhumane conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> in which they had been imprisoned. When a parade was held in late June to celebrate the Allied liberation, many of the Russians participated, wearing uniforms with Red Star badges they had made themselves. During the division's time in Norway, some 400 paratroopers under the command of Major Frederick Gough were temporarily transferred to the Netherlands, where they helped take part in Theirs Is the Glory, a documentary about the Battle of Arnhem.|$|E

25|$|Nuit et Brouillard (Night and Fog, 1955) {{was one of}} {{the first}} documentaries about the Nazi {{concentration}} camps, but it deals more with the memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> than with their actual past existence. Realising that standard documentary techniques would be incapable of confronting the enormity of the horror (and even risked humanising it), Resnais chose to use a distancing technique by alternating historical black-and-white images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> with contemporary colour footage of the sites in long tracking shots. The accompanying narration (written by Jean Cayrol, himself a survivor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps)</b> was intentionally understated to add to the distancing effect.
