Therefore, the illumination must be coming from the stars so we can see them as soon as we open <b>our</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E

25|$|Light rays bend {{when they}} travel from one medium to another; the amount of bending is {{determined}} by the refractive indices of the two media. If one medium has a particular curved shape, it functions as a lens. The cornea, humours, and crystalline lens of the eye together form a lens that focuses images on the retina. <b>Our</b> <b>eyes</b> are adapted for viewing in air. Water, however, has approximately the same refractive index as the cornea (both about 1.33), so immersion effectively eliminates the cornea's focusing properties. When <b>our</b> <b>eyes</b> are in water, instead of focusing images on the retina, they now focus them far behind the retina, resulting in an extremely blurred image from hypermetropia.|$|E

25|$|Anti-glare {{protection}} glasses, or anti-reflective glasses, {{can reduce}} the reflection of light that enters <b>our</b> <b>eyes.</b> The lenses are given an anti-glare coating to prevent reflections of light under different lighting conditions.

25|$|Empedocles is {{credited}} with the first comprehensive theory of light and vision. He put forward {{the idea that we}} see objects because light streams out of <b>our</b> <b>eyes</b> and touches them.

In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of our approach in a controlled setting.

The results show that, for a simple task, it takes 60 % less time to select an object with <b>our</b> <b>eye</b> gaze technique than with a mouse. We also use Fitts' Law to investigate the speed and quality differences between eye gaze selection and mouse selection. <b>Our</b> <b>eye</b> gaze selection technique is shown to produce a low slope, more like pure eye movement, {{which suggests that the}} technique preserves the inherent speed advantage of the eye over the hand. We find that eye gaze interaction is at least as fast as the mouse; and it is convenient in situations where it is important to use the hands for other tasks. It is parti [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Stereopsis {{was first}} {{described}} by Wheatstone in 1838. In 1840 {{he was awarded}} the Royal Medal of the Royal Society for his explanation of binocular vision, a research which led him to make stereoscopic drawings and construct the stereoscope. He showed that our impression of solidity is gained by the combination in the mind of two separate pictures of an object taken by both of <b>our</b> <b>eyes</b> from different points of view. Thus, in the stereoscope, an arrangement of lenses or mirrors, two photographs of the same object taken from different points are so combined as to make the object stand out with a solid aspect. Sir David Brewster improved the stereoscope by dispensing with the mirrors, and bringing it into its existing form with lenses.|$|E
25|$|King was in {{the army}} from 1942 until 1946. He was based in Melbourne, so he was also able to attend Saturday {{afternoon}} art classes with George Bell. Bell had recently returned from overseas and had brought back news of European Modernism and enthusiasm for artists such as Modigliani, Derain, Braque, Matisse and Picasso. King later said that Bell “opened <b>our</b> <b>eyes</b> to modern art {{and it was a}} tremendous experience”. King’s painting at this time shows the influence of George Bell's style of early modernism. While he {{was in the}} army, King met the artist John Brack, who remained a friend until the latter’s death in 1999. In 1945, King joined the Victorian Artists Society and soon became its secretary and exhibitions manager.|$|E
25|$|Unification {{is based}} upon {{triggering}} events creating unified energy fields. Taking light as an example, receptors in <b>our</b> <b>eyes</b> turn on and off at approximately 110 milliseconds. A photon is not a particle but is an accumulation of light energy at a receiving source. At the time of reception, a photon mass force is created triggering the receptor. Once a rod or cone in our eye is triggered our brain energy field merges with the energy field of the object being viewed. During this 110 ms ON interval events at the source and at the receiver are happening at the same time. Since the 4th dimension, time equals zero, the merged three dimensional energy field remains. This allows us to perceive depth and instantaneous movement at the source. It also applies to sub atomic particles as well where electromagnetic energy causes triggering events and unified fields.|$|E
