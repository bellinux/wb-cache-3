5|$|Derogatory {{treatment}} {{must also}} have occurred in circumstances where the author {{has the right to}} be protected from it. The right to object to such treatment does not exist simply to protect damage, mutilation or the author's reputation. For literary, dramatic or musical works, the author is protected from derogatory treatment if the treatment is published commercially, performed in public or communicated to the public; he is also protected when a film <b>or</b> <b>sound</b> recording including the derogatory treatment is publicly issued. If the work is an artistic one, the author can sue when the derogatory treatment is commercially published or publicly exhibited, or when someone publicly shows a film <b>or</b> <b>sound</b> recording of the treatment. For films, the author is protected when the derogatory treatment is shown or communicated to the public, or when copies of it are issued to the public.|$|E
5|$|Rōjaku (老弱): Rō means old, and jaku means {{tranquil}} and quiet. Rōjaku is {{the final}} stage of performance development of the Noh actor, in which he eliminates all unnecessary action <b>or</b> <b>sound</b> in the performance, leaving only the true essence of the scene or action being imitated.|$|E
5|$|A {{sound film}} is a motion picture with {{synchronized}} sound, <b>or</b> <b>sound</b> technologically coupled to image, {{as opposed to a}} silent film. The first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900, but decades passed before sound motion pictures were made commercially practical. Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound-on-disc systems, and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate. Innovations in sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology, which took place in 1923.|$|E

40|$|Novel word {{learning}} {{is reported to}} be problematic for children with severe language impairments (SLI). In this study, we tested electronic storybooks as a tool to support vocabulary acquisition in SLI children. In Experiment 1, 29 kindergarten SLI children heard four e-books each four times: (a) two stories were presented as video books with motion pictures, music, and sounds, and (b) two stories included only static illustrations without music <b>or</b> <b>sounds.</b> Two other stories served as the control condition. Both static and video books were effective in increasing knowledge of unknown words, but static books were most effective. Experiment 2 was designed to examine which elements in video books interfere with word learning: video images <b>or</b> music <b>or</b> <b>sounds.</b> A total of 23 kindergarten SLI children heard 8 storybooks each four times: (a) two static stories without music <b>or</b> <b>sounds,</b> (b) two static stories with music <b>or</b> <b>sounds,</b> (c) two video stories without music <b>or</b> <b>sounds,</b> and (d) two video books with music <b>or</b> <b>sounds.</b> Video images and static illustrations were equally effective, but the presence of music <b>or</b> <b>sounds</b> moderated word learning. In children with severe SLI, background music interfered with learning. Problems with speech perception in noisy conditions may be an underlying factor of SLI and should be considered in selecting teaching aids and learning environments...|$|R
50|$|A labial-coronal {{consonant}} is a consonant {{produced with}} two simultaneous articulators: With the lips ('labial'; a p, b, <b>or</b> m <b>sound),</b> {{and with the}} tongue (at the gums, an 'alveolar' t, d, <b>or</b> n <b>sound,</b> <b>or</b> further back, a 'post-alveolar' ch, j, <b>or</b> ny <b>sound).</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{music for}} each {{game in the}} Myst series has fallen to various composers. Originally, the Millers {{believed}} that any music <b>or</b> <b>sound</b> besides ambient noise would distract the player from the game and ruin the sense of reality; Myst, therefore, was to have no music at all. A sound test eventually persuaded the developers that music heightened the sense of immersion rather than lessening it, and as such Robyn Miller composed 40 minutes of synthesized music for the game. He would also produce the music for Riven, which featured leitmotifs {{for each of the}} main characters. Virgin Records bought the rights to the music and produced the soundtracks, which were released in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Yajnavalkya dedicates {{significant}} amount of text to explain the art of mastering each stage of breathing, that is inhalation, exhalation and stoppage between the two. Each stage is {{discussed in terms of}} its nature, speed, duration, depth on its own and relative to the other stage of breathing, regulating these at will during asanas meant for cleansing body or mind. In order to keep time for each stage without distraction, he recommends silently reciting time-measured mantras <b>or</b> <b>sound</b> beats to help measure each stage and thus establish progress during the yoga. The mantras for internal time measurement mentioned include Pranava (Om), Gayatri with Vyahritis, or Gayatri with Siras.|$|E
5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. There is also a single alien creature that pursues the player. The alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight <b>or</b> <b>sound.</b> Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the alien finding the player. For example, if the alien is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract the alien, forcing the player to wisely use the tracker and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether the alien creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|E

5|$|The {{music of}} SaGa 1 was {{composed}} by Nobuo Uematsu, {{and that of}} SaGa 2 by Uematsu and Kenji Ito, while the music of SaGa 3 was composed by Ryuji Sasai and Chihiro Fujioka. Uematsu has stated that while SaGa 1s music could be made of better quality, the emphasis was on enjoying the game, and not solely its appearance <b>or</b> <b>sound.</b> The Game Boy's sound hardware was {{different from that of}} the Famicom, which Uematsu was used to composing for at the time, with new stereo and waveforms and only three notes; as a result, Uematsu struggled with deciding how to work with these, developing new themes for the music in the process despite SaGa 1s director Akitoshi Kawazu's desire to have the music be in the same vein as Square's preceding Final Fantasy titles. Uematsu has stated that the Game Boy was a system he would like to compose for again. SaGa 2 was the first soundtrack or album that Kenji Ito worked on.|$|E
5|$|When sandhoppers (such as Talitrus saltator) {{are taken}} up a beach, they easily {{find their way}} {{back down to the}} sea. It has been shown that this is not simply by moving {{downhill}} or towards the sight <b>or</b> <b>sound</b> of the sea. A group of sandhoppers were acclimatised to a day/night cycle under artificial lighting, whose timing was gradually changed until it was 12 hours out of phase with the natural cycle. Then, the sandhoppers were placed on the beach in natural sunlight. They moved away from the sea, up the beach. The experiment implied that the sandhoppers use the sun and their internal clock to determine their heading, and that they had learnt the actual direction down to the sea on their particular beach.|$|E
5|$|He also gains {{the ability}} to constrict objects and enemies with a band of energy, {{although}} this feature {{was one of the}} few abilities not to feature in future games. Players can find an ancient relic that gives Raziel the power to fire bolts of telekinetic energy, which cause little damage by themselves but can knock enemies into hazards and push objects from a distance. Baptism in holy flame can transform the Soul Reaver into the Fire Reaver, which can set enemies aflame and adds fire to Raziel's telekinetic bolts. Players can also find magical glyphs that allow Raziel to expend magical energy to attack groups of enemies simultaneously. These glyphs typically involve vampire weaknesses such as sunlight, fire, water, <b>or</b> <b>sound,</b> as well as additions such as telekinetic force (available well before the normal telekinesis becomes available) and the causing of earthquakes to temporarily stun enemies. Glyphs are acquired through finding glyph altars, specific locations in Nosgoth where the skills can be learned, and solving a puzzle before being granted the magical ability. However, Raziel begins the game with access to the 'Shift' glyph, granting {{the ability to}} shift between the material and spectral planes, with no glyph altar necessary.|$|E
