500|$|In July 1919, Lloyd {{was again}} {{left off the}} cast list for the Royal Variety Performance, which paid tribute to the acts who helped raise money and boost morale during the war years. She was devastated at the snub and grew bitter towards her rivals who had been acknowledged. Her biographer Midge Gillies {{compared}} Lloyd to a [...] "talented old aunt who {{must be allowed to}} have her turn at the piano even though all everyone really wants is jazz <b>or</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Picture Palace". She toured Cardiff in 1919, and in 1920 she was earning £11,000 a year. Despite the high earnings, she was living beyond her means, with a reckless tendency to spend money. She was famous for her generosity, but was unable to differentiate between those in need and those who simply exploited her kindness. Her extravagant tastes, an accumulation of writs from disgruntled theatre managers, an inability to save money, and generous hand-outs to friends and family, resulted in severe money troubles during the final years of her life.|$|E

500|$|Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) {{has bought}} tickets to a Lady Gaga concert, but his plans go south when Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) gets sick. This causes Mitchell {{to be torn}} on whether he should stay with Cameron <b>or</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> concert. He {{eventually}} tries to be supporting and attempts to subtly persuade Cameron to let him go, as Claire has advised him to do. Mitchell tries to sneak away after noticing that Cameron has drunk most of a cough syrup that would [...] "put down a Grizzly", but he is caught when Cam wakes up. Mitchell then gives a speech about how selfish he has been to Cameron, before realizing Cameron has fallen asleep once more. He then sneaks off to the concert and comes back before Cameron wakes up again. When Cameron does wake up, Mitchell acts as if he never went out, unaware that his glow stick is still visible underneath his shirt. As Cameron returns to bed, he pleasantly informs Mitchell that his glow-stick is still flashing, and switches off the light to reveal it.|$|E
500|$|After several further {{meetings}} and {{an exchange of}} letters, Grant agreed to work for Crowley as his secretary and personal assistant. Now living in relative poverty, Crowley was unable to pay Grant for his services in money, instead paying him in magical instruction. In March 1945, Grant moved into a lodge cottage in the grounds of Netherwood, a Sussex boarding house where Crowley was living. He continued living there with Crowley for several months, dealing with the old man's correspondences and needs. In turn, {{he was allowed to}} read from Crowley's extensive library on occult subjects, and performed ceremonial magic workings with him, becoming a high initiate of Crowley's magical group, the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). Crowley saw Grant as a potential leader of O.T.O. in the UK, writing in his diary, [...] "value of Grant. If I die <b>or</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> USA, there must be a trained man {{to take care of the}} English O.T.O." [...] However, they also argued, with Grant trying to convince Crowley to relocate to London. On one occasion Crowley shouted at him: [...] "You are the most consummate BORE that the world has yet known. And this at 20!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Chief Flying Hawk and {{his family}} did not enjoy the {{benefits}} of white men. His son Felix Flying Hawk, and later his grandson David Flying Hawk, had been cheated and jailed by the white man for stealing their own horses. Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, his family and friends, had been assassinated. He had been placed on public exhibition as a specimen of the vanishing race to escape the poverty and constraints an Indian reservation. [...] "He stroked his breast {{to show that he}} was poorly dressed. He was still wearing a coat and vest which had been given to him by the host on a previous visit. He said that if he had what was due him from the Government he could dress like other people, and have plenty to eat all the time, much of the time he was hungry and could not buy medicine <b>or</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> doctor when sick." [...] On March 5, 1929, at age seventy-five, Flying Hawk made his last visit to The Wigwam in Du Bois, Pennsylvania. He had been traveling with the circus, and the pony riding, war dances and inclement weather were weighing on his health. The Wigwam was good medicine. [...] At The Wigwam he would could have fresh air, good food, rest and home comforts. Chief Flying Hawk died at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, December 24, 1931, at the age of 77 in want. He had written that during the previous winter of 1930-31 his little band was saved from starvation only through contributions from Gutzon Borglum and the American Red Cross. Sadly, it was rumored that Chief Flying Hawk died of starvation.|$|E
2500|$|Jobs {{told his}} {{official}} biographer that after meeting Simpson, {{he wanted to}} become involved in her ongoing search for their father. When Jandali was found working in Sacramento, Jobs decided that only Simpson would meet him. Jandali and Simpson spoke for several hours at which point he told her that he had left teaching to join the restaurant business. He also said that he and Schieble had given another child away for adoption but that [...] "we'll never see that baby again. That baby's gone." [...] (Simpson did not mention that she had met Jobs). Jandali further told Simpson that he once managed a Mediterranean restaurant near San Jose and that [...] "all of the successful technology people used to come there. Even Steve Jobs... oh yeah, he used to come in, and he was a sweet guy, and a big tipper." [...] After hearing about the visit, Jobs recalled that [...] "it was amazing... I had been to that restaurant a few times and I remember meeting the owner. He was Syrian. Balding. We shook hands." [...] However, Jobs did not want to meet Jandali because [...] "I was a wealthy man by then, and I didn't trust him not to try to blackmail me <b>or</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press about it... I asked Mona not to tell him about me." [...] Jandali later discovered his relationship to Jobs through an online blog. He then contacted Simpson and asked [...] "what is this thing about Steve Jobs?" [...] Simpson told him that it was true and later commented, [...] "My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but he is very, very passive... he never contacted Steve." [...] Because Simpson, herself, researched her Syrian roots and began to meet members of the family, she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did. Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in the 1992 novel, The Lost Father. She would also create a fictional portrait of Jobs in the 1996 novel, A Regular Guy.|$|E
