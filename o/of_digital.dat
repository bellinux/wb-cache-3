Further, new designs <b>of</b> recursive <b>digital</b> integrators are obtained by inverting the transfer functions <b>of</b> designed recursive <b>digital</b> differentiators with suitable modifications. Thereafter, the zero-reflection approach is discussed and then applied to improve the phase responses <b>of</b> designed recursive <b>digital</b> differentiators and integrators. The beauty of finally obtained recursive digital differentiators and integrators {{is that they have}} nearly linear phase responses over wideband and also provide the choice <b>of</b> suitable recursive <b>digital</b> differentiator and integrator according to the importance of accuracy, bandwidth and the system simplicity...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Sapienza Digital Library (SDL) was {{released}} in December 2013 as result of a research project undertaken by Sapienza University of Rome and the Cineca consortium, since 2011. The digital library has been collecting materials coming from different kind of organizations including departments, libraries, and archives, belonging or donated to Sapienza University. The main result {{of the project was}} the development of an information framework supporting multidisciplinary organizations in managing digital materials, maintaining scientific, organizational and operational responsibilities. The technical solution adopted has found a trade-off between the standardization <b>of</b> the <b>digital</b> processes and products, and the preservation of the scientific materials’ peculiarities. The automatic standard translation, and the enrichment <b>of</b> the <b>digital</b> resource's metadata have reached the main goal <b>of</b> providing <b>digital</b> resources with the essential information necessary to their management in different technological contexts. The reuse <b>of</b> the <b>digital</b> information and contents, in different application contexts, has converted the holistic vision <b>of</b> a <b>digital</b> library in the implementation of an information infrastructure, setting the foundation for the long-term access and usability <b>of</b> its <b>digital</b> assets...|$|R
