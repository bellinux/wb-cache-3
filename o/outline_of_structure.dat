In terms of Cognitive Science, it provides bridge between information processing, conceptualization of the resources, perceptual skills and topics related to the cognitive psychology.

This poly-representational approach leads to cognitive process which is multitasking in the way of perception, attention, interpretation, understanding and remembrance of human behaviour interaction.

40|$|Insufficient {{moisture}} control and climate adaptation {{in the building}} process is partially due to an increased centralisation and standardisation in the construction sector. Climate challenges and developments are not afforded sufficient attention in the building process. A fresh report from the SINTEF Building and Infrastructure programme “Climate 2000 ” concludes that {{the participants in the}} construction sector need and expect the development of multi-disciplinary guidelines in order to properly address process-related moisture problems. This paper discusses the development of multi-disciplinary guidelines and management tools in dealing with moisture challenges at the various stages of the building process. The principal basis of the paper is a qualitative survey in an ongoing PhD study by one of the authors. A large number of building defects occur {{in the early stages of}} the building process, often caused by incomplete or non-existent requirements, omissions, errors in the design phase or ignorance in the field of building physics. Other issues are related to management and organisation, participant interfaces, risk-assessment analysis, technical and functional requirements, material use, drying methods, micro-biological growth and indoor climate, related to the complexity of the construction process as a whole. The paper concludes with an <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>structure</b> and content of a practica...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present current views on the {{physiology}} of striated muscle, and in particular on the mechanism of contraction and the way in which the contractile machinery is activated. The preparation which has been most extensively studied is the isolated living muscle fibre of the frog, and this fact has governed the choice of the experimental evidence cited. The plan of the article is to give a brief <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>structure,</b> a description of the processes involved in activation, and an account of the development of ideas about the mechanism of contraction, starting from the sliding filament theory and A. F. Huxley's 1957 model. Structural outline. When viewed under a light microscope, a striated muscle fibre can be seen to consist of a number of myofibrils, each of which is made up of alternate light and dark bands. In an unstained or living fibre these bands, which result from materials of different refractive index, can be made visible by the use of polarized light or inter-ference microscopy. It is now known that the dark or A-band consists of thick filaments of the protein myosin, while the light or I-band consists of thin filaments of the protein actin, together with the proteins tropomyosin and troponin which perform an important regulatory role. The main structural features are shown diagrammatically in figure 1. In addition to the contractile proteins, striated muscle contains two internal membrane systems, the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the transverse tubules. The transverse tubules are invaginations of the surface membrane and run into the core of the muscle fibre. In contrast, the sarcoplasmic reticulum is composed of a longitudinal network of tubules which run into sacs or terminal dstemae where the sarcoplasmic reticulum comes into close proximity to the transverse tubules. The regions of conjunction appear as regularly spaced triads in longitudinal sections of muscle (a triad is a group of three "vesicles", consisting of a pair of terminal cisterna...|$|E

Plants growing above a buried man made structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as middens) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening grain, which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision.
