5|$|The {{most ancient}} polyadenylating enzyme is polynucleotide phosphorylase. This enzyme {{is part of}} both the {{bacterial}} degradosome and the archaeal exosome, two closely related complexes that recycle RNA into nucleotides. This enzyme degrades RNA by attacking the bond between the 3'-most nucleotides with a phosphate, breaking off a diphosphate nucleotide. This reaction is reversible, and so the enzyme can also extend RNA with more nucleotides. The heteropolymeric tail added by polynucleotide phosphorylase is very rich in adenine. The choice of adenine is most likely the result of higher ADP concentrations than <b>other</b> <b>nucleotides</b> {{as a result of}} using ATP as an energy currency, making it more likely to be incorporated in this tail in early lifeforms. It has been suggested that the involvement of adenine-rich tails in RNA degradation prompted the later evolution of polyadenylate polymerases (the enzymes that produce poly(A) tails with no <b>other</b> <b>nucleotides</b> in them).|$|E
25|$|In {{the natural}} state, a VS {{ribozyme}} motif contains 154 nucleotides that fold into six helices. Its RNA contains a self-cleavage element which {{is thought to}} act in the processing of intermediates made through the process of replication. The H-shaped structure of the ribozyme is organized by two three-way junctions which determine the overall fold of the ribozyme. A unique feature of the structure of ribozyme is that even if the majority of helix IV and distal end of helix VI would be deleted there would be no significant loss of activity However, if the lengths of helix III and V were to be changed there be major loss of activity. The base bulges of the ribozyme, helices II and IV have very important structural roles since replacing them with <b>other</b> <b>nucleotides</b> does not affect their activity. Basically, VS ribozyme's activity is very dependent on the local sequence of the two three-way junctions. The three-way junction present in the VS ribozyme is very similar to the one seen in the small (23S) subunit of rRNA.|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, {{based on}} [...] "the {{vast array of}} {{molecular}} sequences now available from all domains of life," [...] a formal test of universal common ancestry was published. The formal test favored {{the existence of a}} universal common ancestor over a wide class of alternative hypotheses that included horizontal gene transfer. While the formal test overwhelmingly favored the existence of a single LUCA, this does not imply that the LUCA was ever alone. Instead, it was one of several early microbes. [...] However, given that many <b>other</b> <b>nucleotides</b> are possible besides those that are actually used in DNA and RNA today, it is almost certain that all organisms do have a single common ancestor. This is because it is extremely unlikely that organisms which descended from separate incidents where organic molecules initially came together to form cell-like structures would be able to complete a horizontal gene transfer without garbling each other's genes, converting them into noncoding segments. Further, many more amino acids are chemically possible than the twenty found in modern protein molecules. These lines of chemical evidence, taken into account for the formal statistical test by Theobald (2010), point to a single cell having been the LUCA in that, although other early microbes probably existed, only the LUCA's descendents survived beyond the Paleoarchean Era. With a common framework in the AT/GC rule and the standard twenty amino acids, horizontal gene transfer would have been feasible and could have been very common later on among the progeny of that single cell.|$|E
