5|$|A new owner, Michael Duane Roberts, {{bought the}} Vortex Mine in 2008. Its {{operations}} {{were designed to}} be environmentally friendly, using methods such as recycling all water and not using other chemicals. Roberts died in a mining accident in 2012. , there was also mining activity by individual hobby miners <b>on</b> <b>small</b> parcels at Sapphire Village, but the Roncor mines remained inactive.|$|E
5|$|A plutoid or ice dwarf is a trans-Neptunian dwarf planet, i.e. a body {{orbiting}} beyond Neptune that is massive {{enough to}} be rounded in shape. The term plutoid {{was adopted by the}} International Astronomical Union (IAU) working group Committee <b>on</b> <b>Small</b> Bodies Nomenclature, but was rejected by the IAU working group Planetary System Nomenclature. The term plutoid is not widely used by astronomers, though ice dwarf is not uncommon.|$|E

5|$|All British {{patterns}} were different, first tested <b>on</b> <b>small</b> wooden models viewed through a periscope in a studio. Most {{of the model}} designs were painted by women from London's Royal Academy of Arts. A foreman then scaled up their designs for the real thing. Painters, however, were not alone in the project. Creative people including sculptors, artists, and set designers designed camouflage.|$|E

5|$|Eurasian rock pipits {{construct}} a cup nest under coastal vegetation or in cliff crevices and lay {{four to six}} speckled pale grey eggs which hatch in about two weeks with a further 16days to fledging. Although insects are occasionally caught in flight, the pipits feed mainly <b>on</b> <b>small</b> invertebrates picked off the rocks or from shallow water.|$|E

5|$|Fewer than 20 {{percent of}} the {{residents}} of the watersheds are permanent inhabitants. Most seasonal inhabitants come from the area of Lancaster or Philadelphia. Approximately four {{percent of the}} residents of the Kettle Creek watershed live <b>on</b> <b>small</b> farms. There are a number of villages in the watershed, including Westport, Cross Fork, Oleona, Carter Camp and Germania.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Azhdarchoidea mostly {{contained}} terrestrial pterosaurs. Tapejarids are {{an exception}} in being considered arboreal omnivores, feeding heavily on vegetation, but possibly also <b>on</b> <b>small</b> insects and vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|In {{solid-phase}} synthesis, an oligonucleotide being assembled is covalently bound, via its 3'-terminal hydroxy group, to a {{solid support}} material and remains {{attached to it}} over the entire course of the chain assembly. The solid support is contained in columns whose dimensions depend {{on the scale of}} synthesis and may vary between 0.05mL and several liters. The overwhelming majority of oligonucleotides are synthesized <b>on</b> <b>small</b> scale ranging from 10nmol to 1μmol. More recently, high-throughput oligonucleotide synthesis where the solid support is contained in the wells of multi-well plates (most often, 96 or 384 wells per plate) became a method of choice for parallel synthesis of oligonucleotides <b>on</b> <b>small</b> scale. At the end of the chain assembly, the oligonucleotide is released from the solid support and is eluted from the column or the well.|$|E

5|$|Larvae hatch {{from their}} egg casing {{in two to}} six weeks. They are born carnivores, feeding instinctively <b>on</b> <b>small</b> {{invertebrates}} that move in their field of vision. Food items include small aquatic crustaceans (cladocerans, copepods and ostracods), aquatic dipterans and tadpoles. As they develop, they naturally feed upon larger prey. To increase their chances for survival, some individuals grow bigger heads and become cannibals, and feed upon their own brood mates.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the smoothtooth blacktip shark's natural history; it likely inhabits shallow waters and feeds <b>on</b> <b>small</b> bony fishes. It is presumably {{viviparous}} like other members of its family. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) last assessed this species as Endangered. Although more specimens have since been discovered, the conservation status of this species remains precarious due to heavy fishing and habitat degradation within its range.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the breed}} first became commercial, it {{has spread to}} Canada and become a major {{contributor}} in the commercial lamb industry. The breed adapts well to confinement and is readily used in accelerated crossbreeding programs.

50|$|Small {{boards are}} often used for novice players (double-digit kyu players) just {{learning}} to play Go, or for quick games. As the fewer moves made when playing <b>on</b> <b>smaller</b> boards gives White fewer chances to overcome the advantage conferred by the handicap, smaller handicaps are used <b>on</b> <b>smaller</b> go boards (most commonly 13&times;13 and 9&times;9).|$|R

5|$|The creek whaler feeds {{predominantly}} <b>on</b> <b>small</b> teleost fishes (including {{threadfin breams}} and lizardfishes) and crustaceans (including penaeid prawns and mantis shrimps); cephalopods are also infrequently consumed.

5|$|The manakins are {{a family}} of {{subtropical}} and tropical mainland Central American, South America, and Trinidad and Tobago.

5|$|There were unfounded rumours of its {{continued}} existence until {{the beginning of}} the 20th century. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway stated that an extremely small population might still survive <b>on</b> <b>small</b> offshore islets, since this is often the last refuge of endangered birds. Hume countered that these islets were probably too small to sustain a population.|$|E
