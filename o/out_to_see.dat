5|$|In August 1964, the Beatles {{returned}} to the United States for a second visit, this time remaining for a month-long tour. Epstein was unsure about the group's popularity in the US, and avoided booking them into stadiums. At the opening date at the Cow Palace, San Francisco on August 19, over 17,000 fans turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the group.|$|E
5|$|The Royal party {{arrived at}} the Gare de l'Est train station in Paris in the pre-dawn hours of August 10, rejoined by Macfarlane. Most {{of the first day}} they {{remained}} in their suite, recovering from travel exhaustion. They soon ventured <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> to the Auteuil Hippodrome, and stopped by various concert halls.|$|E

60|$|However, Frank {{said little}} of all this, only quite simply, {{as if he}} were going to ride to the petty {{sessions}} at Colbeam, mentioned that he thought it right <b>to</b> go <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Canada <b>to</b> <b>see</b> about his nephew.|$|R
5|$|Westminster was surcharged with multitudes of {{all sorts}} of people in their streets, houses, windows, leads and gutters, that came <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the obsequy, and when they beheld her statue lying upon the coffin, there was such a general sighing, groaning and weeping as the like hath not been seen or known in the memory of man.|$|E
5|$|As {{the patrons}} leave due to not {{receiving}} a refund, the pictures going black {{when they were}} getting to important scenes, and complain about {{the taste of the}} popcorn (due to the mess the babies have made in the concession stand), Stu is angry at the fact that The Land Without Smiles went out at the climax. But at least they think that Tommy can go through a whole movie without any fuss. Because they didn't see the ending, Didi and Stu decide to go <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the movie again next week, but at a different theater. As Grandpa Lou eats a candy bar in the back seat, Tommy takes notice of a flashing Reptar billboard as they drive by.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{second year}} as coach {{was the best}} in Stanford rugby history: the team was undefeated {{entering}} the Big Game at California, who was also undefeated. A record crowd of 26,000 turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Stanford defeat the Bears, 26–8. This {{would be the last}} Big Game for several years as California returned to football for the 1915 season. Despite Stanford's success in rugby, the previous year's humiliating defeats to the All Blacks and the switch by rivals USC and California to football intensified the sentiment for Stanford to switch back as well.|$|E

5|$|More unwelcome {{visitors}} then {{arrive in}} the shape of British pirates, who make a living by trading or stealing sandalwood. The three boys hide in a cave, but Ralph is captured when he ventures <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if the intruders have left, and is taken on board the pirate schooner. He strikes up a friendship with one of the crew, Bloody Bill, and when the ship calls at the island of Emo to trade for more wood Ralph experiences many facets of the island's culture: the popular sport of surfing, the sacrificing of babies to eel gods, rape, and cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|Rivadavia was {{commissioned}} into the Armada de la República Argentina on 27 August 1914 at the Charlestown Navy Yard, {{although it was}} not fully completed until December. On 23 December 1914, Rivadavia left the United States for Argentina. It arrived in its capital, Buenos Aires, on 19 February 1915. Over 47,000 people came <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the new ship over the next three days, including the President Victorino de la Plaza. In April 1915, Rivadavia was put into the training division of the Navy, remaining there until 1917, when the navy transferred the ship into the First Division. In 1917, Rivadavia sailed to Comodoro Rivadavia when communist oil workers went on strike.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 {{game would}} be the first to award the Crab Bowl Trophy to the winner. 69,348 fans turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the game at M Bank Stadium in Baltimore, which was {{considered}} a home game for Maryland. Navy dominated the game statistically, controlling the ball for nearly 40 minutes and gaining 485 yards. The Midshipmen also converted 10 of 18 third-down chances. But their errors and failure to convert near the goal line cost them dearly. Navy kicker Joe Buckley missed a 32-yard field goal attempt, quarterback Ricky Dobbs lost a fumble at the Maryland 1-yard line, and Maryland eventually walked away with a 17–14 victory.|$|E

60|$|Having now {{brought my}} mind {{a little to}} relish my condition, and given over looking <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if I could spy a ship—I say, giving over these things, I began to apply myself to arrange my way of living, and to make things as easy to me as I could.|$|R
5|$|After passing slower cars, Vettel {{began to}} resume his battle with the Ferrari drivers. Button made a pit stop on lap 22 and reemerged in fifth {{position}} behind his teammate Hamilton. The Ferrari cars began to set faster lap times {{than the rest of}} the field as Massa started to pull away from Alonso and held a lead of three seconds over his teammate. Alonso responded to Massa's newfound pace by recording a new fastest lap of the race, a 1:18.075 on lap 28, having backed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how fast his car was in clean air, before the two drivers began to trade fastest times over the next three laps. Webber attempted to place pressure on Button in a battle for fifth place, although Button was using a defensive strategy by using his McLaren's straight-line speed advantage. De La Rosa caught up to Hülkenberg and passed him at the turn six hairpin on lap 35. Three laps later, Hamilton was instructed by McLaren to conserve fuel usage in the event they could use an aggressive fuel saving mode towards the end of the race.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes-Benz {{returned}} to Grand Prix racing {{at the start}} of the 1937 season with a new car. The W125 was a vast improvement on its predecessor, its supercharged eight cylinder 5.6-litre engine delivered significantly more power than the W25: 650 brake horsepower compared to 500. The first major race of 1937 was the Avusrennen where 300,000people turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the cars race on the newly re-constructed track. In order to keep speeds consistently high, the north curve was turned into a steeply banked turn, apparently at the suggestion of Adolf Hitler. Driving a streamlined Mercedes-Benz, Caracciola won his heat against Rosemeyer, averaging around , although a transmission failure forced him to retire in the final. Following the AVUS race, Caracciola, along with Rosemeyer, Nuvolari and Mercedes' new driver, Richard Seaman, went to race in the revived Vanderbilt Cup in America, and in doing so missed the Belgian Grand Prix, which took place six days later. Caracciola led until lap22, when he retired with a broken supercharger.|$|E
5|$|Minas Geraes was christened by Senhora Regis de Oliveira, {{the wife}} of the Brazilian {{minister}} to Great Britain, and launched at Newcastle-on-Tyne on 10 September 1908. During fitting-out, it was moved to Vickers' Walker Yard, and thousands turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the incomplete ship squeeze barely underneath and through overhead and swing bridges. After completion, Minas Geraes was handed over by Armstrong on 5 January to the Brazilian Commission on behalf of the Brazilian government, while the ship's company was mustered on deck. The British Royal Navy carried out its gunnery trials at the request of Armstrong's and with the agreement of the Brazilian government. Although the idea of having superfiring turrets was not new—the American s were also designed and built in this fashion around the same time—the trials attracted interest from a few nations, who sent representatives to observe. They wanted to resolve two major questions: the effect that firing the upper superfiring turrets would have on the crewmen in the lower guns, and whether smoke from the discharge of the lower guns would hinder the targeting capabilities of the upper turret. The tests resolved both questions satisfactorily.|$|E
5000|$|In mid-2016, while {{preparing}} to release his career-spanning box set Squeeze Box, Yankovic once again reached <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Blunt <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{if in the}} seven years he had changed his mind. Once again, however, Yankovic was denied permission to release the song, and he tweeted: [...] "Sadly, Blunt won’t let me include 'You’re Pitiful' on my box set." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Nima Nourizadeh and released on 11 December 2006. It opens with an aerial shot of a piano which begins to play by itself, and then moves to reveal a film set. Allen stands on a lamppost, wearing a raincoat, with lights, a camera and directors surrounding her. The image zooms into the camera from the studio and turns the video black-and-white, with the story coming to life, as the singer begins the first verse. From the lamppost {{she is able to}} see her former self walking down the street with her boyfriend. While they enter a building, a light comes out in one of the windows, revealing their silhouettes kissing. The caption changes, with the two of them dancing, while a man plays the piano in the background; as he dips her and holds this position, she continues to sing. The camera zooms <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a heart shaped window surrounding the two that opens and changes to a picture on Allen's wall. She is alone in a room, staring at a mirror. Her hair is let down and she is wearing a white nightgown. The piano is seen again playing itself, as the image shifts to the window, where Allen is again portrayed leaning against the lamppost in the street, as {{in the beginning of the}} video. She again looks at the silhouettes in the window of the building, as it collapses on her, once again changing the scene. This time, the singer is looking through another window, and then turns around to a mirror which captures a door. The former Allen with the raincoat walks through with her boyfriend, as their shadows are seen kissing. The image changes to Allen from the film set, zooming out from the camera's viewing piece, making the video in colour again.|$|E
25|$|In a 2004 {{interview}} with Mike Wallace on 60 Minutes, Earnhardt revealed {{himself to be}} a Republican and a supporter of President George W. Bush. Despite this, he took his crew <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the film Fahrenheit 9/11 earlier that year.|$|E
