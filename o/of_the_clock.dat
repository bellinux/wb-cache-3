5|$|The clock has its {{original}} medieval face. As well as showing {{the time on}} a 24-hour dial, it reflects {{the motion of the}} Sun and Moon, the phases of the Moon, and the time since the last new Moon. The astronomical dial represents a geocentric or pre-Copernican view of the universe, with the Sun and Moon revolving round a central fixed Earth, like that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> at Ottery St Mary. The quarters are chimed by a quarter jack {{in the form of a}} small automaton known as Jack Blandifers, who hits two bells with hammers and two with his heels. At the striking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> jousting knights appear above the clock face.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock's</b> name is unknown.

However, {{there is no record}} that shows <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> celebrates Ohio's statehood and <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> was ordered twelve years after Ohio became a state, {{at a time when there}} were already eighteen states.|$|R

5|$|The clock dial {{has been}} dated {{to either the}} {{building}} phases of 1405 or 1467-83, or to {{the installation of the}} Brunner clockwork in 1527-30. Ueli Bellwald notes that the planisphere uses a southern projection, as was characteristic for 15th-century astronomical clocks; all later such clocks use a northern projection. This would seem to confirm the dating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> to the 1405 or 1467/83 renovations.|$|E
5|$|The {{manipulation}} {{of time at}} higher latitudes (for example Iceland, Nunavut or Alaska) has little impact on daily life, because the length of day and night changes more extremely throughout the seasons (in comparison to other latitudes), and thus sunrise and sunset times are significantly out of phase with standard working hours regardless of manipulations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> DST is also of little use for locations near the equator, because these regions see only a small variation in daylight {{in the course of}} the year. The effect also varies according to how far east or west the location is within its time zone, with locations farther east inside the time zone benefiting more from DST than locations farther west in the same time zone.|$|E

They also revealed that acclaimed Japanese film director Kinji Fukasaku would be directing the cutscenes, Keita Amemiya was in charge of character design, Noboru Sugimura was writing the scenario, and Kouji 'Cozy' Kubo was composing the music. At the time of the announcement, the game was still in the casting phase; over two hundred actresses had auditioned for the motion capture of Alyssa. The game was first shown at E3 in May 2002, where a non-playable demo was on show at the Capcom booth. In November, Capcom announced the game would be released in Japan on December 12.|$|E

Above the rete, a display indicates {{the day of the}} week. Because leap days are not supported by the clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each leap year on 29 February. A moon dial circles the inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the moon phase. The principal hand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the retes calendar dial. The larger one circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.|$|E

The game was first shown at E3 in May 2002, where a non-playable demo was on show at the Capcom booth. Released in December later that year, Clock Tower 3 was a commercial failure. Capcom had projected sales of at least 450,000, {{but by the end of}} 2003, it had only sold 122,022 units.

5|$|In 1872 a major {{programme}} of building works was undertaken to a design by Edward Middleton Barry. This provided {{a roof over}} the central court of the Exchange and a new suite of offices {{on the first floor}} above the colonnades around the court. Other internal alterations appear to {{have been made in the}} late 19th century, possibly also by Barry in 1872. This is uncertain as Barry's plans are yet to be found. Further extensive alterations were made in the 1900s when the City Valuer's Department moved to the Exchange in 1907. These included the provision of a lift from the basement and cellars to the first floor and major alterations to the cellars under the central part of the Exchange. Since 1945 further alterations have included the replacement of the roof over the central court by a temporary roof at a lower level, the removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> tower at the back of the building and the internal rebuilding of all four floors of the coffeehouse together with the corresponding floors over the main entrance.|$|E
5|$|The Emirates Stadium pays {{tribute to}} Arsenal's former home, Highbury. The club's offices are officially called Highbury House, located {{north-east}} of Emirates Stadium, and house the bust of Herbert Chapman that used to reside at Highbury. Three other busts that used to reside at Highbury of Claude Ferrier (architect of Highbury's East stand), Denis Hill-Wood (former Arsenal chairman) and manager Arsène Wenger have also been moved to Emirates Stadium and are in display in {{the entrance of the}} Diamond Club. Additionally, the two bridges over the railway line to the east of the stadium, connecting the stadium to Drayton Park, are called the Clock End and North Bank bridges, after the stands at Highbury; the clock that gave its name to the old Clock End has been resited on the new clock end which features a newer, larger replica <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> The Arsenal club museum, which was formerly held in the North Bank Stand, opened in October 2006 and is located {{to the north of the}} stadium, within the Northern Triangle building. It houses the marble statues that were once held in the marble halls of Highbury.|$|E
5|$|The {{clock and}} {{carillon}} (bell tower) of 23 bells was erected in 1922, {{the same year}} as Lutyens' memorial, on the corn exchange in the town centre. Three of the bells were inscribed with names of casualties from the war, chosen to represent all of Spalding's war dead, while others were inscribed with names of those involved in the commemorations. The corn exchange was demolished in 1972 and replaced with the South Holland Centre, an arts venue, with the clock and carillon re-housed in a tower on the roof. After refurbishment of the South Holland Centre in 1998, a new glass tower was built to house the clock and carillon after the bells were cleaned. On Armistice Day (11 November) 1998, the Western Front Association unveiled a plaque on the South Holland Centre to explain the significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> tower.|$|E

5|$|The clock tower has not survived, and its exact {{location}} is undetermined, {{although it is}} believed to have been located at or near the Spasskaya Tower (formerly known as Frolovskaya). The clock was for a long time the only one in Moscow and Russia, and worked for more than two centuries without failure. It was then replaced by another clock which was destroyed in a fire. A miniature from the 16th-century Ostermanovskij manuscript (of the Litsevoy Collection of Chronicles, Ancient Chronicle, sheet 587, drawing 1175) exists which depicts the monk Lazar showing Vasily and two of his vassals the finished clock tower. Although the tower is gone, the illustration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> tower and monastery can be seen in the Polytechnical Museum in Moscow as of 2006. A 16th-century chronicle says that Lazar was paid 150 rubles for his work ("sta bole polutorasta rublev").|$|E

5|$|Although clepsydrae {{were more}} useful than sundials—they {{could be used}} indoors, during the night, and also when the sky was cloudy—they were not as {{accurate}}; the Greeks, therefore, sought a way to improve their water clocks. Although still not as accurate as sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325, and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand, making the reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> more precise and convenient. One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by water pressure: when the container holding the water was full, the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman horologists beginning in 100, and improvements continued {{to be made in}} the following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or moving mechanisms. There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze.|$|E

5|$|The teams traded baskets for the {{majority}} of the second half, with the largest advantage being four points by Georgetown with over twelve minutes to go in the game. After five more minutes of game play, North Carolina managed to cut the lead to two, 56–54. The Tar Heels then obtained a single point lead with 5:50 to play and set up in their four corners offense,\ to run out the game clock. The Tar Heels were quickly fouled and Jimmy Black converted two free throws, while Fred Brown made two his own on the other end to bring the score to 59–58 in favor of North Carolina. With three and a half minutes left in the contest, Michael Jordan drove to the basket and made a shot off of the backboard to increase the Tar Heels' lead to three, 61–58. On Georgetown's following possession, Ewing made a jump shot to bring his team within one. North Carolina again set up in the four corners. While making an attempt to steal the ball from Matt Doherty, the Hoyas' Eric Smith was called for a foul. This sent Doherty to the line for a one-and-one, which he missed and Ewing got the rebound. Smith then hit a twelve-foot jump shot with 57 seconds left to go to give Georgetown the lead, 62–61. Then, Jordan received a pass from Black and connected on a shot with fifteen seconds remaining in the game to give North Carolina a one-point lead. On the Hoyas' ensuing possession, Fred Brown passed the ball away to Worthy, who proceeded to run out some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> before being fouled. Because the Hoyas were in the double bonus, Worthy received two free throw attempts, both of which he missed. Floyd got the rebound and attempted a last second shot that also missed.|$|E
