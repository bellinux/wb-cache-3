5|$|The Spanish influence. The {{architectural}} {{influence of}} the ruling Spanish (Illustration 13), although this was a milder influence {{than that of the}} Normans. The Spanish style, a more restrained version of French renaissance architecture, is particularly evident in eastern Sicily, where — owing to minor insurrections — the Spanish maintained a stronger military presence. Messina's monumental Porta Grazia, erected in 1680 as the entrance to a Spanish citadel, would not be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> any of the towns and citadels built by the Spanish in their colonies elsewhere. The style of this arched city gate, with its ornate mouldings and scrolls, was widely copied all over Catania immediately following the quake.|$|E

5|$|Australia dropped Bill Brown, who {{had scored}} 73 runs at a batting average of 24.33 in three Test innings during the season. Brown was Australia's reserve opener, but Bradman opted to play {{him out of}} {{position}} in the middle-order, instead of using a specialist. Brown had also struggled in his unfamiliar position in the matches against Worcestershire and the Marylebone Cricket Club, scoring 25 and 26. According to O'Reilly, Brown had appeared <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the middle-order because {{he was used to}} the opener's classical role of defending against and wearing down the opening bowlers, rather than attacking. He was replaced by the all rounder Sam Loxton, who had hammered an unbeaten 159—including several sixes—against Gloucestershire, and that innings was particularly noted for his quick footwork, which he used to charge and attack the off spin of Tom Goddard.|$|E
5|$|Brown was rested for the {{following}} match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test. Loxton scored 159 not out, featuring in two century partnerships and propelling Australia to 7/774 declared, which was its highest score of the tour and {{laid the foundation for}} an innings victory. Loxton’s effort was enough to oust Brown from his middle-order position for the Third Test at Old Trafford. According to O’Reilly, Brown had appeared <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the middle-order because he was used to the opener’s classical role of defending against and wearing down the opening bowlers, rather than attacking. During the Test, which was drawn, Barnes was injured and off spinner Ian Johnson was used as a makeshift opener as Morris was the only specialist left after Brown’s omission. Afterwards, Brown managed only eight as Australia defeated Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match between Tests.|$|E
5|$|Following Stalin's death, a {{realignment}} of {{the leadership}} strengthened Molotov's position. Georgy Malenkov, Stalin's successor in the post of Premier, reappointed Molotov as Minister of Foreign Affairs on 5 March 1953. Although Molotov {{was seen as a}} likely successor to Stalin {{in the immediate aftermath of}} his death, he never sought to become leader of the Soviet Union. A Troika was established immediately after Stalin's death, consisting of Malenkov, Beria, and Molotov, but ended when Malenkov and Molotov deceived Beria. Molotov supported the removal and later the execution of Beria on the orders of Khrushchev. The new Party Secretary, Khrushchev, soon emerged as the new leader of the Soviet Union. He presided over a gradual domestic liberalisation and a thaw in foreign policy, as was manifest in a reconciliation with Josip Broz Tito's government in Yugoslavia, which Stalin had expelled from the communist movement. Molotov, an old-guard Stalinist, seemed increasingly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the new environment, but he represented the Soviet Union at the Geneva Conference of 1955.|$|E

5|$|Christchurch and its {{surrounding}} areas are unique in New Zealand for their particular style of Gothic architecture, {{something that can be}} directly attributed to Benjamin Mountfort. While Mountfort did accept small private domestic commissions, he is today better known for the designs executed for public, civic bodies, and the church. His monumental Gothic stone civic buildings in Christchurch, which would not be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> Oxford or Cambridge, are an amazing achievement over adversity of materials. His hallmark wooden Gothic churches today epitomise the 19th-century province of Canterbury. They are accepted, and indeed appear as part of the landscape. In this way, Benjamin Mountfort's achievement was to make his favoured style of architecture synonymous with the identity of the province of Canterbury. Following his death, one of his seven children, Cyril, continued to work in his father's Gothic style well into the 20th century. Cyril Mountfort was responsible for the church of St Luke's in the City, which was an unexecuted design of his father's. In this way, and through the daily public use of his many buildings, Mountfort's legacy lives on. He ranks today with his contemporary R A Lawson as one of New Zealand's greatest 19th-century architects.|$|E

25|$|The {{next step}} in the {{initiation}} ceremony was the lecture given by the master of ceremonies, called Mabalasig/Mabalasik (terrible brother), who informed the neophyte to withdraw if he lacked courage since he would be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the patriotic society. If the neophyte persisted, he was presented to the assembly of the brethren, who subjected him to various ordeals such as blindfolding him and making him shoot a supposedly a revolver at a person, or forcing him to jump over a supposedly hot flame. After the ordeals came to final rite–the pacto de sangre or blood compact–in which the neophyte signed the oath with blood taken from his arm. He was then accepted as a full-pledged member, with a symbolic name by which he was known within Katipunan circles.

25|$|Wardell's Gothic Revival style ANZ Bank {{is located}} on Collins Street in Melbourne and is {{considered}} by many to be the finest secular Neo-Gothic building in Australia. It was built between the years of 1883 to 1887. It was the largest bank in Australia at the time, and also the most expensive (£77,000). In 1987 it was voted Victoria's favorite building by readers of The Age newspaper. The bank manager, Sir George Verdon, was responsible for commissioning the bank's lavish design. He lived in an apartment above the bank. The banking chamber is supported by teal columns with floral Crockett capitals, and the ceiling is hand-painted in gold leaf. The interior features spectacular flying Gothic arches, which appear <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> a secular building. One noteworthy aspect to the exterior is an octagonal turret. Supported by a ribbed corbel it rises into a small medieval spire, demonstrating Wardell's love of asymmetry.|$|E
