5|$|Domination: Two teams {{compete to}} control various control points to earn points. Standard maps contain three control points. Control of these points is {{initially}} accomplished through occupation (physically occupying the space), but control <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> continues until a player from another team occupies the space.

5|$|According to Citizenship and Immigration Canada, {{there are}} three main classifications for immigrants: Family class (persons closely related to Canadian residents), Economic class (admitted on the basis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> system that {{accounts}} for age, health and labour-market skills required for cost effectively inducting the immigrants into Canada's labour market) and Refugee class (those seeking protection by applying {{to remain in the}} country by way of the Canadian immigration and refugee law). In 2008, there were 65,567 immigrants in the family class, 21,860 refugees, and 149,072 economic immigrants amongst the 247,243 total immigrants to the country. Canada resettles over one in 10 of the world's refugees and {{has one of the highest}} per-capita immigration rates in the world.|$|E
5|$|All the {{interesting}} cases of homotopy groups of spheres involve mappings from a higher-dimensional sphere {{onto one of}} lower dimension. Unfortunately, the only example which can easily be visualized is not interesting: there are no nontrivial mappings from the ordinary sphere to the circle. Hence, π2(S1) = 0. This is because S1 has the real line as its universal cover which is contractible (it has the homotopy type <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>point).</b> In addition, because S2 is simply connected, by the lifting criterion, any map from S2 to S1 can be lifted to a map into the real line and the nullhomotopy descends to the downstairs space.|$|E
5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} usually develop {{resistance to}} linezolid {{as the result}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> mutation known as G2576T, in which a guanine base is replaced with thymine in base pair 2576 of the genes coding for 23S ribosomal RNA. This {{is the most common}} mechanism of resistance in staphylococci, and the only one known to date in isolates of E. faecium. Other mechanisms have been identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae (including mutations in an RNA methyltransferase that methylates G2445 of the 23S rRNA and mutations causing increased expression of ABC transporter genes) and in Staphylococcus epidermidis.|$|E

The season finale was watched by 3.22 million viewers and received a 1.7 ratings share in the 18–49 demographic. The first season tied with the TNT series Falling Skies as the biggest new cable series of the year among adults 18–49.|$|E
5|$|Several other {{geometrical}} {{solutions to}} Apollonius' problem {{were developed in}} the 19th century. The most notable solutions are those of Jean-Victor Poncelet (1811) and of Joseph Diaz Gergonne (1814). Whereas Poncelet's proof relies on homothetic centers of circles and the power <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> theorem, Gergonne's method exploits the conjugate relation between lines and their poles in a circle. Methods using circle inversion were pioneered by Julius Petersen in 1879; {{one example is the}} annular solution method of HSM Coxeter. Another approach uses Lie sphere geometry, which was developed by Sophus Lie.|$|E
5|$|The Buffalo {{track and}} field program has had several successes {{throughout}} its history.

5|$|The {{starting}} point for string theory {{is the idea that}} the point-like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing the path <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> particle by a two-dimensional surface representing the motion of a string. Unlike in quantum field theory, string theory does not yet have a full non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.|$|E
5|$|Viète {{began by}} solving the PPP case (three points) {{following}} {{the method of}} Euclid in his Elements. From this, he derived a lemma corresponding to the power <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> theorem, which he used to solve the LPP case (a line and two points). Following Euclid a second time, Viète solved the LLL case (three lines) using the angle bisectors. He then derived a lemma for constructing the line perpendicular to an angle bisector that passes through a point, which he used to solve the LLP problem (two lines and a point). This accounts {{for the first four}} cases of Apollonius' problem, those that do not involve circles.|$|E
5|$|In the National Football League (NFL), a tied game {{occurs when}} a regular season game ends with both teams having an equal score. Since the National Hockey League {{eliminated}} ties by adopting the shootout following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the NFL {{is the only one}} of the four major professional sports leagues in North America to have tied games in regular-season play, as Major League Baseball (in the modern era since 1900) and the National Basketball Association have historically played until there is a winner. Unlike soccer (association football), in which teams routinely play for a draw (for the benefit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> in the standings), NFL teams rarely play for ties. In general, tied games in the NFL are frowned upon by both teams and fans. Because tied games are rare, some players have not known they were allowed in the NFL, such as former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, who said after a tie game against the Cincinnati Bengals that he did not know a tie was a possible result.|$|E
