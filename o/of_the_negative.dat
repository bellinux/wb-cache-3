5|$|Corrective rape is on {{the rise}} in South Africa. More than 10 lesbians are raped or gang-raped weekly, as {{estimated}} by Luleki Sizwe, a South African nonprofit. It is estimated that at least 500 lesbians become victims of corrective rape every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the Western Cape live in fear of being sexually assaulted, as reported by the Triangle Project in 2008. Yet, victims of corrective rape are less likely to report it because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> social view of homosexuality.|$|E

Jailhouse Rock earned mixed reviews, with most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> reception directed towards Presley's persona.

40|$|There {{have been}} many {{investigations}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mutual synchronization <b>of</b> oscillators. In this study we consider N oscillators which have the same natural frequency, mu-tually coupled by one negative resistor. In this system, according to <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coupling <b>negative</b> resistor, we can observe various interesting synchroniza-tion phenomena. Because this system tends to minimize the power consumption in <b>the</b> coupling <b>negative</b> resis-tor. Especially when i- v characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coupling <b>negative</b> resistor are not third-power, but linear and neg-ative, this system tends to be stable by producing the power in the coupling one. The phase states are changed accordeing to <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coupling <b>negative</b> resistor...|$|R

5|$|Opposing Force was {{received}} well by critics, many describing {{it as the}} new benchmark title for expansion packs, {{in a similar fashion}} to how Half-Life revolutionized the first-person shooter genre.

Following intense criticism in the press—especially the black press, because of the high percentage of African Americans who received blue discharges—and in Congress, the blue discharge was discontinued in 1947, replaced by two new classifications: general and undesirable.|$|E

5|$|The {{first step}} towards colourisation was the {{restoration}} of the original negatives, which were in poor condition owing to extensive printing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> during the original theatrical release. Costly and labour-intensive restoration was essential before colourisation could be carried out. The negative was cleaned of fungal growth, damaged portions were restored, and missing parts of frames were re-instated. After cleaning, each of the 300,000 frames <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> was scanned into a 10 megabytes-sized file and then was digitally restored. The entire restoration work was undertaken by Acris Lab, Chennai. The dialogues in the original soundtrack were also in a bad state of preservation, which necessitated having the sound cleaned at Chace Studio in the United States. The background score and the entire musical track was recreated by Naushad and Uttam Singh. For the songs, the original voices of the singers like Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Mohammed Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar were extracted from the original mixed track and the same were recreated with re-recorded score in 6.1 surround sound.|$|E
