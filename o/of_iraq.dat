5|$|After the US {{strikes on}} Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998, Blair {{released}} a statement supporting the actions; he lent military support to America's 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. In March 2003, the Labour government, fearing Saddam Hussein's alleged access to weapons of mass destruction, participated in the American-led invasion <b>of</b> <b>Iraq.</b> British intervention in Iraq promoted public protest. Crowds numbering 400,000 and more demonstrated in October 2002, and again the following spring. On 15th February 2003, over 1,000,000 people demonstrated {{against the war in}} Iraq, and 60,000 marched in Manchester before the Labour Party Conference, with the demonstrators' issues including British occupation of Afghanistan and the forthcoming invasion <b>of</b> <b>Iraq.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fadhil al-Barrak, an Iraqi Ba'athist historian, credits Sidqi as {{the author}} of the whole {{campaign}} and the ensuing massacres. For him, the events were part of a history <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> prior to the true nationalist revolution.|$|E

25|$|The {{overthrow}} <b>of</b> <b>Iraq's</b> monarchy instilled {{new hope}} for the Assyrian cause. However, this hope was short-lived. Qassem was assassinated in February 1963, throwing Iraq into a period of political uncertainty. Out of the chaos emerged the Ba'ath Party who promptly took control <b>of</b> <b>Iraq's</b> government.|$|R
5|$|More than 300 {{hours of}} footage was {{recorded}} by {{the students and the}} two Iraqi associate producers. It was transcribed, translated and edited into a 90-minute film. Getting the tapes out <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> proved difficult for Winter and O'Mahoney, who remained in the UK. They had to rely on journalists from many news agencies, especially those in the BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle the tapes out <b>of</b> <b>Iraq.</b> When curfews were enforced, weeks passed before the producers received new footage because it was impossible for anybody to leave their homes or the country.|$|E

5|$|The {{suppression}} of Ibn al-Ash'ath's revolt signalled {{the end of}} the power of the tribal nobility <b>of</b> <b>Iraq,</b> which henceforth came under the direct control of the Umayyad regime's staunchly loyal Syrian troops. Later revolts, under Yazid ibn al-Muhallab and Zayd ibn Ali, also failed, and it was not until the success of the Abbasid Revolution that the Syrian dominance <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> was broken.|$|E

5|$|According to the Syrian authorities, {{the camp}} of archaeologists was looted, {{along with the}} tools and {{ceramics}} kept in it. The site changed hands between the different combatants, mainly the Kurdish People's Protection Units and the Islamic State <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> and the Levant.

5|$|After Ali's death, the Shias <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> {{declared}} Ali's {{eldest son}} Hasan {{the successor to}} Ali, thus proclaiming him as their new caliph. However, Hasan {{was not interested in}} becoming caliph, and to prevent further bloodshed, he signed the Hasan–Muawiya treaty and abdicated in favor of Muawiyah, who became the first caliph of the Umayyad caliphate. Muawiyah died in Medina at the age of forty-five in 669, and was succeeded by Yazid I in 61 AH (680 CE) but Hasan's brother Husayn ibn Ali refused to accept Yazid's leadership. After being invited by the Shiites <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> in the same year, Husayn started his march to Iraq. However, during their stay at Karbala, his army was massacred by Yazid at the Battle of Karbala on 10 Muharram (10 October) and his death is commemorated by Shia every year during Muharram.|$|E

5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} <b>of</b> <b>Iraq.</b> None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government <b>of</b> <b>Iraq,</b> you could very easily end up seeing pieces <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E
