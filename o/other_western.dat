5|$|In the skull, the braincase is high, the {{zygomatic}} arches (cheekbones) are {{broad and}} squared, and the incisive foramina, which perforate the palate between the incisors and the molars, {{are long and}} broad. The upper incisors are orthodont, with their cutting edge nearly vertical. Morphometrically, the skull of O.peninsulae is sharply distinct from <b>other</b> <b>western</b> Mexican Oryzomys.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how Oryzomys peninsulae arrived at its recent locale in Baja California Sur. In 1922, Nelson {{suggested that it}} may have been introduced from another part of Mexico in a shipment of farm products, but this hypothesis is disproved by the clear differentiation from <b>other</b> <b>western</b> Mexican Oryzomys that the species exhibits.|$|E

5|$|Banksia verticillata {{is seldom}} seen in cultivation. The natural growing {{conditions}} {{point to a}} sunny aspect and good drainage as being important in cultivation. It is good for coastal situations and erosion control. Very sensitive to dieback, B. verticillata (like most <b>other</b> <b>western</b> Australian banksias) perishes quickly in humid conditions or poor drainage. It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia integrifolia. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 49 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels' efforts {{had little}} impact {{for the time}} being, as while Hitler was in {{principle}} in favour of total war, he {{was not prepared to}} implement changes over the objections of his ministers. The discovery around this time of a mass grave of Polish officers that had been killed by the Red Army in the 1940 Katyn massacre was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviets and the <b>other</b> <b>western</b> allies.|$|E

5|$|In its 2008 report, Reporters Without Borders {{ranked the}} Zimbabwean media as 151st out of 173. The {{government}} also bans many foreign broadcasting stations from Zimbabwe, including the CBC, Sky News, Channel 4, American Broadcasting Company, Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), and Fox News. News agencies and newspapers from <b>other</b> <b>Western</b> countries and South Africa {{have also been}} banned from the country.|$|E
5|$|Mainstream American cuisine {{is similar}} to that in <b>other</b> <b>Western</b> countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain {{products}} made of wheat flour and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers. These home grown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays; Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.|$|E
5|$|S.e.caesia, {{the most}} {{widespread}} of the western subspecies, has orange-buff underparts except for a white throat and cheeks. The <b>other</b> <b>western</b> forms mainly differ in the exact shade of the underparts, although some southeastern forms also show a white forehead and supercilium. S.e.sinensis and S.e.formosana, of China and Taiwan respectively, have buff underparts like the western races, but have buff, instead of white, throats.|$|E

5|$|The Chalukyas revived their {{fortunes}} in 973 after over 200 years of dormancy when {{much of the}} Deccan was {{under the rule of}} the Rashtrakutas. The genealogy of the kings of this empire is still debated. One theory, based on contemporary literary and inscriptional evidence plus the finding that the Western Chalukyas employed titles and names commonly used by the early Chalukyas, suggests that the Western Chalukya kings belonged to the same family line as the illustrious Badami Chalukya dynasty of the 6th century while <b>other</b> <b>Western</b> Chalukya inscriptional evidence indicates they were a distinct line unrelated to the Early Chalukyas.|$|E
5|$|The Western Australia State Emergency Service (SES) was {{responsible}} for responses relating to the damage from Rosita. SES workers worked to help the community recover, tarping damaged roofs and clearing debris from roads and around houses where it limited access from residents. Most work involved clearing vegetation from power lines to enable Western Power to begin repairs. Volunteers from <b>other</b> <b>Western</b> Australian cities and towns such as Perth, Bunbury, Karratha, Derby and Tom Price had arrived to assist with requests for help. During the recovery period, the SES earned huge public respect, and residents were pleased with the quick response of the SES.|$|E
5|$|The {{calendar}} for the ELCA {{is similar}} to many <b>other</b> <b>Western</b> Calendars in {{that it does not}} commemorate any persons from the Old Testament. The calendars of the Orthodox Churches have Old Testament individuals, and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod has done the same. At one point there was a proposal to include a day on the Episcopal Church calendar (which was taken into consideration by the Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship in developing the Lutheran Book of Worship) for Old Testament saints following the octave of All Saints (November 8), but this idea was ultimately rejected as tokenism.|$|E
5000|$|Scott McGee {{noted that}} [...] "...more than just making a social {{statement}} like <b>other</b> <b>Westerns</b> {{of the period}} were apt to do, Ford instills in The Searchers a visual poetry {{and a sense of}} melancholy that is rare in American films and rarer still to Westerns.|$|R
5000|$|... "Outlaws {{was a good}} western for television, but {{it never}} got the respect it deserved, and like many <b>other</b> <b>westerns</b> during the early 1960s, it got ran over by the cop and sitcom shows", wrote Ronald Jackson and Doug Abbott in the book Fifty Years of the Television Western.|$|R
5000|$|The film premiered in late 1968 to mixed reviews. Some critics {{thought the}} film was {{not as good as}} the <b>other</b> <b>Westerns</b> being made in Europe, in particular, the Italian westerns (known as [...] "spaghetti Westerns") by which Sergio Leone, Lee Van Cleef, and Clint Eastwood were {{building}} their reputations.|$|R

5|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary film critics. After {{the release of}} the film in June 1941, Columbia allowed the release of two more Medico films, Thunder Over the Prairie (July 1941) and Prairie Stranger (September 1941). Starrett, who went on to star in around sixty <b>other</b> <b>western</b> flicks, found The Medico of Painted Springs to be his favorite film. The film has many noticeable differences from Rubel's original work.|$|E

5|$|This was {{a success}} for the western {{development}} project at some level, for statistics show a substantial growth in foreign investment in the western regions. However, the rate of progress was not equal in all regions, partially due {{to the creation of}} the West Triangle Economic Zone, which sped up development in Chengdu, Chongqing, and Xi'an, but slowed down development in other areas of the West. For example, while foreign direct investment in Chongqing grew, foreign investment in <b>other</b> <b>Western</b> Chinese cities like Guizhou, Guangxi, and Ningxia declined significantly, dropping about USD $19.71, $250.96 million, and $34.54 million respectively.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the auspices}} of a régime d'exception (the {{equivalent}} {{of a state of}} emergency), Mobutu assumed sweeping, almost absolute, power for five years after which, he claimed, democracy would be restored. Mobutu's coup, which promised both economic and political stability, was supported by the United States and <b>other</b> <b>Western</b> governments. Initially, his rule met widespread popularity. He increasingly took other powers, abolishing the post of Prime Minister in 1966 and dissolving Parliament in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Upon Duke Frederick II of Austria's invitation, Béla went to Hainburg an der Donau. However, {{instead of}} helping Béla, the Duke {{forced him to}} cede three {{counties}} (most probably Locsmánd, Pozsony, and Sopron). From Hainburg, Béla fled to Zagreb and sent letters to Pope Gregory IX, Emperor Frederick II, King Louis IX of France and <b>other</b> <b>Western</b> European monarchs, urging them to send reinforcements to Hungary. In the hope of military assistance, he even accepted Emperor Frederick II's suzerainty in June. The Pope declared a Crusade against the Mongols, but no reinforcements arrived.|$|E
50|$|Kenneth Gamet, the {{producer}} of Casey Jones, offers a gentler Western series against the more violent adult shows of the time. Casey Jones features the same classical types of plots as <b>other</b> <b>westerns</b> such as train robbers and vandals, but the episodes center as much on Casey's interaction with his family, particularly Casey, Jr.|$|R
