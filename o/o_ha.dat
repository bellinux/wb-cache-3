Nitrogen content of young mature leaves decreased significantly with increasing K 2 O levels while protein content of young mature leaves increased significantly with increasing K 2 O levels and overall maximum increase of 37. 5 % was observed at 200 kg K 2 <b>O</b> <b>ha</b> - 1. Phosphorus content of young mature leaves increased significantly with potash application and it was maximum at 100 kg K 2 <b>O</b> <b>ha</b> - 1.

Early stalk population increased with increasing potash levels. Number of tillers per hectare, at early growth stages, were minimum and significantly low in plots where K was not applied. Application of K increased millable canes significantly. K {{did not affect}} total soluble solids (Brix %) during October and {{at the start of}} November. However, during December total soluble solids (Brix %) were significantly higher in K applied plots than the control. Stalk height was increased with K application. It was minimum in control plots (250. 33 cm) and maximum (310 cm) at 150 kg K 2 <b>O</b> <b>ha</b> - 1 . Stalk diameter also followed a similar trend which was minimum (27. 40 mm) in control and was maximum (31. 75 mm) at 150 kg K 2 <b>O</b> <b>ha</b> - 1 . Cane yield increased with K application and it was maximum (155 t ha - 1 ) with the application of 150 kg K 2 O ha- 1 .

The objective was to evaluate the effect of management of Striga hermonthica on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) using Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and NPK fertilizer levels. The trials were laid out in split-split plot arrangement in a randomized complete block design. The main-plot treatments consisted of three sorghum varieties; SAMSORG 3, ICSVIII and SAMSORG 14 while the sub-plot treatments consisted of inoculations; Striga mixed with Glomus, Striga only and Glomus only as well as no inoculation control. The sub-sub-plot treatments were made up of NPK fertilizer levels; (100 kg N, 50 kg P 2 O 5, 50 kg K 2 <b>O</b> <b>ha</b> - 1), (50 kg N, 50 kg P 2 O 5, 50 kg K 2 <b>O</b> <b>ha</b> - 1) and (0 kg N, 0 kg P 2 O 5, 0 kg K 2 <b>O</b> <b>ha</b> - 1). The result obtained showed that sorghum variety SAMSORG 3 were taller, having more vigour and lower reaction to Striga parasitism {{which resulted in the}} crop producing higher dry matter compared to the other two varieties.

Whole of P, K and Â½ of N were applied at the time of rice transplanting. Twelve and half kg ha - 1 ZnSO 4 was also applied 15 days after rice transplanting. The remaining half of N was applied 30 days after rice transplanting. The system of layout was Randomized Complete Block Design with four replications. The net plot size was 6 x 4 m. Fertilizer sources of NPK were urea, TSP and SOP, respectively. Rice salt tolerant line PB- 95 was used as test crops. The data of growth parameters and yield was recorded and samples of paddy and straw were collected treatment-wise and analysed for N, P and K contents. Soil samples after harvesting the crop were also collected, processed and analysed for the changes in the extractable soil K. The results showed that increasing rates of potassium fertilizer increased the number of tillers m - 2, plant height (cm), 1000 -paddy weight and paddy as well as straw yield significantly.
