40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{to account for}} asperity interaction and bulk substrate deformation in models that utilize statistical summation of asperity forces to characterize contact between rough surfaces. Interaction deformations of noncontacting asperities are calculated based on the probability that they have taller neighbors in their vicinity, whose deformation upon contact, in turn, induces local substrate deformations. The effect of the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> on the total contact force is explored and a limit is proposed based on asperity density.

Understanding the relationship between structure and viscosity is a key issue for the directed design of ILs with low viscosity.

From the interaction mechanism, the main role is played by dimensional resonance when the electron continuously absorbs energy from the field {{as a result of}} synchronizing its oscillation with the field. This dimensional resonance is possible when the frequency characterizing the laser field is a multiple of the phonon frequency. Whether a photon is absorbed or emitted, the initial level from where the transition occurs defines the temperature dependence.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to the first two parameters, {{an increase in the}} number of causative SNPs leads to {{an increase in the number}} of correctly-identified causative SNPs. This phenomenon can be explained as follows. To identify a multi-locus interaction, a number of SNP pairs must be included in the output ensemble. For instance, an ensemble of three SNP pairs namely (SNP 1, SNP 2), (SNP 2, SNP 3) and (SNP 1, SNP 3) leads to the identification of a three-locus interaction between SNP 1, SNP 2 and SNP 3. However, only two-out-of-three SNP pairs are necessary for the correct interaction identification. Similarly, only three-out-of-six possible SNP pairs are necessary for the correct identification of a four-locus interaction. In other words, the number of redundant SNP pairs increases as the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> increases. Hence, the number of correctly-identified causative SNPs increases when there are more redundant SNP pairs, which can be omitted from the output ensemble.|$|E
