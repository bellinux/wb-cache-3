25|$|Level {{crossings}} (groesfan reilffordd in Welsh, rèidh-tharsainn in Scottish Gaelic) in the United Kingdom {{started out}} as manually gated crossings opened by a signalman. These were standard all across the network until mechanised barriers started to be introduced. These could be operated by a signalman adjacent to the crossing or were automatic. After the major Hixon rail crash in 1968, the design of level crossings started to change, and all mechanised crossings {{had to have a}} preliminary amber light fitted, which makes UK level crossings one of only a few countries with this design of crossing. More recent advantages in technology have led to more technical automatic crossings, more safer open crossings, and crossings with <b>obstacle</b> <b>detection</b> systems to detect stray people or vehicles on the crossing.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} level {{crossings}} {{depends on the}} location, but often early level crossings had a flagman in a nearby booth who would, on the approach of a train, wave a red flag or lantern to stop all traffic and clear the tracks. Gated crossings became commonplace in many areas, as they protected the railway from people trespassing and livestock, and they protected the users of the crossing when closed by the signalman/gateman. In {{the second quarter of}} the 20th century, manual or electrical closable gates that barricaded the roadway started to be introduced, intended to be a complete barrier against intrusion of any road traffic onto the railway. Automatic crossings are now commonplace in some countries as motor vehicles replaced horse-drawn vehicles and the need for animal protection diminished with time. Full, half or no barrier crossings superseded gated crossings, although crossings of older types can still be found in places. New technology is advancing to create new ways of protecting the railway from users of a level crossing, {{with one of the most}} recent being <b>obstacle</b> <b>detection</b> scanners fitted to some crossings in Europe.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{crossings}} in {{the country}} now are composed of lights, alarms and full, half or no barriers. The lights are unique in {{that they have a}} preliminary amber light accompanied by two red lights. The alarms come in a range of tones, and can be composed of a speaking warning saying [...] "warning: another train is approaching". Many crossings are automatic, but can be manually operated or by CCTV or <b>obstacle</b> <b>detection.</b> There are some gated crossings still left {{in the country}}, as well as some open crossings with no lights, barriers or alarms. There are various classifications for crossings in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|In Sweden {{there are}} 8,500 level {{crossings}} (järnvägskorsning in Swedish), according to Trafikverket, the Swedish Transport Administration (former Banverket, Swedish Rail Administration). On public roads they have light signals {{with or without}} gates. On private roads there are level crossings without signals. Most accidents occur on crossings without gates. For many years there have been activities {{to reduce the number}} of accidents, usually by adding gates, or adding light signals if there were none. On the main lines many bridges have been built, and also anywhere a new road or new railway has been built. Still there are some level crossings left on the main lines. A train speed of 200km/h is allowed in Sweden over level crossings, if there are gates and an <b>obstacle</b> <b>detection</b> unit. This unit detects cars on the track and prevents the gates from closing fully and stops the train. According to Trafikverket in 15 years there has only been one serious collision between a car and a train on such a level crossing, when a car ran through the gates just in front of the train. Level crossings have a power line with a sign saying [...] "livsfarlig ledning" [...] (dangerous conduit). Some also have a sign saying [...] "se upp för tåg" [...] (beware of trains) ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a fast and robust stereo {{algorithm}} to perform in-vehicle <b>obstacles</b> <b>detection</b> and characterization. The stereo algorithm used {{is called the}} ”v-disparity ” 1 algorithm which provides a suitable representation of the geometric content of the road scene. The stereo algorithm principle is described, and then the in-vehicle embedded system is presented. This system {{can be divided into}} two main stages. The first one deals with onboard road <b>obstacles</b> <b>detection</b> (the focus is put on obstacle areas and free road surface extraction), whereas the second one is about obstacles characterization (car/truck discrimination). For each stage, we first present {{the way in which the}} ”v-disparity ” algorithm is used, and then report representative experiments on real situations which show that our solution is accurate, reliable and efficient. In particular, both processes are fast, generic, robust to noise and bad conditions, and work even in the case of partial occlusions.

40|$|In recent years, {{autonomous}} {{collision avoidance}} {{systems have been}} researched and developed for realizing safe driving using cameras and sensors. These systems are designed to warn the drivers the presence of obstacles {{on the road and}} help them take a necessary action in advance. In these systems, the ability to detect obstacles is essential. Although various methods of <b>obstacles</b> <b>detection</b> have already been reported, these existing <b>obstacles</b> <b>detection</b> methods have some inadequacies: Some of them can be only used to detect moving obstacles; Some of them cannot extract the shape of obstacles, and they only use a rectangular frame that surrounds an obstacle to represent a detected obstacle; Some of them can only be used to detect one kind of specific object, such as pedestrian detection or vehicle detection. In order {{to make up for the}} inadequacies of the existing <b>obstacles</b> <b>detection</b> method, in this thesis, a method is proposed for detecting obstacles on a road by the employment of the background modeling and the road region <b>detection.</b> In <b>obstacles</b> <b>detection,</b> true <b>obstacles</b> are defined as arbitrary objects which protrude from the ground plane in the road region, including static and moving objects. Road marks in the road region and objects outside the road region are considered as false obstacles. The output of this <b>obstacles</b> <b>detection</b> method is based on the obstacles’ shape. In this thesis, we also propose a method of classifying 2 D objects and 3 D objects. The results of 2 D objects and 3 D objects classification can be used in the resultant image of <b>obstacles</b> <b>detection</b> to delete 2 D objects (such as road marks) and improve the accuracy of <b>obstacles</b> <b>detection.</b> The originalities of this thesis are as follows:In the first place, the proposed method can detect arbitrary objects including both static objects and moving objects. This is helpful because static objects such as boxes fallen on the road from a car are dangerous for drivers. In the second place, the output of the proposed method is the shape of obstacles. Extraction of the shape of an obstacle is important for obstacles recognition. If the detected obstacle is recognized as a pedestrian from its shape, we can foresee his/her next motion. In the third place, the proposed method can distinguish which objects are 3 D objects, and which objects are 2 D objects in a pile of objects using a monocular camera. It is useful in the <b>obstacles</b> <b>detection</b> and other applications, such as navigation of walking robots. In the performed experiments, it is shown that the proposed <b>obstacles</b> <b>detection</b> method is able to extract the shape of both static and moving obstacles in a frontal view from a car. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:工博甲第 371 号　学位授与年月日:平成 26 年 9 月 26 日 1 Introduction| 2 Obstacles Detection| 3 2 D and 3 D Objects Classification| 4 Final Experimental Results and Evaluation| 5 Conclusion|References九州工業大学平成 26 年...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Reliable <b>obstacles</b> <b>detection</b> under {{adverse weather}} conditions, {{especially}} foggy conditions, is a challenging task because the contrast is drastically reduced. Consequently, the classical approaches relying on pattern recognition techniques or {{points of interest}} matching are not so efficient anymore.

40|$|A {{reliable}} {{perception of}} the real world is a key-feature for an autonomous vehicle and the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). <b>Obstacles</b> <b>detection</b> (OD) {{is one of the main}} components for the correct reconstruction of the dynamic world. Historical approaches based on stereo vision and other 3 D perception technologies (e. g. LIDAR) have been adapted to the ADAS first and autonomous ground vehicles, after, providing excellent results. The <b>obstacles</b> <b>detection</b> is a very broad field and this domain counts a lot of works in the last years. In academic research, it has been clearly established the essential role of these systems to realize active safety systems for accident prevention, reflecting also the innovative systems introduced by industry. These systems need to accurately assess situational criticalities and simultaneously assess awareness of these criticalities by the driver; it requires that the <b>obstacles</b> <b>detection</b> algorithms must be reliable and accurate, providing: a real-time output, a stable and robust representation of the environment and an estimation independent from lighting and weather conditions. Initial systems relied on only one exteroceptive sensor (e. g. radar or laser for ACC and camera for LDW) in addition to proprioceptive sensors such as wheel speed and yaw rate sensors. But, current systems, such as ACC operating at the entire speed range or autonomous braking for collision avoidance, require the use of multiple sensors since individually they can not meet these requirements. It has led the community to move towards the use of a combination of them in order to exploit the benefits of each one. Pedestrians and vehicles detection are ones of the major thrusts in situational criticalities assessment, still remaining an active area of research. ADASs are the most prominent use case of pedestrians and vehicles detection. Vehicles should be equipped with sensing capabilities able to detect and act on objects in dangerous situations, where the driver would not be able to avoid a collision. A full ADAS or autonomous vehicle, with regard to pedestrians and vehicles, would not only include detection but also tracking, orientation, intent analysis, and collision prediction. The system detects obstacles using a probabilistic occupancy grid built from a multi-resolution disparity map. Obstacles classification is based on an AdaBoost SoftCascade trained on Aggregate Channel Features. A final stage of tracking and fusion guarantees stability and robustness to the result...|$|R
