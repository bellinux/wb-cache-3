40|$|Although the {{cost-effective}} {{integration of}} diverse smart <b>object</b> <b>technologies</b> like radio-frequency identification (RFID), real-time locating systems (RTLS), and {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSN) into existing enterprise infrastructures {{is very important for}} companies, integration aspects are ignored by researches frequently. Furthermore it could be observed, that existing commercial middleware products aiming at integration ignore the trend of consolidation between diverse smart <b>object</b> <b>technologies</b> by focusing on passive RFID only. This paper introduces the concept of an integration platform for diverse smart <b>object</b> <b>technologies</b> together with an abstract software architecture. The functionalities that such a platform should provide are derived from the requirements of real world applications and aim at drastically reduced integration costs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{platform}} for developing mobile, locative and collaborative distributed games comprised of small programmable <b>object</b> <b>technologies</b> (e. g., wireless sensor networks) and traditional networked processors. The platform is implemented {{using a combination of}} JAVA Standard and Mobile editions, targeting also mobile phones that have some kind of sensors installed. We briefly present the architecture of our platform and demonstrate its capabilities by reporting two pervasive multiplayer games. The key characteristic of these games is that players interact with each other and their surrounding environment by moving, running and gesturing as a means to perform game related actions, using small programmable <b>object</b> <b>technologies.</b> ...|$|R

SmartTools uses <b>object</b> <b>technologies</b> such as visitor patterns and aspect-oriented programming. It provides code generation adapted to the usage of those technologies to support the development of semantic analyses.

40|$|Java {{is a key}} {{technology}} {{for the next generation}} of data acquisition systems(DAQ). Java has excellent features, but its performance is a weak point. Weevaluated various Javabenchmark programs with a Java interpreter, Java Just-In-Time compilers (JIT), a Java native code compiler (TowerJ) which generates native code, and a C compiler. Thebenchmark programs include high performance computation, inter-process communication, thread switching, file I/O, readout (VMEbus and CAMAC), distributed <b>object</b> <b>technologies</b> (HORB etc.), <b>object</b> oriented database access and so on. The benchmark programs showed the following: HORB had the best performance among the distributed <b>object</b> <b>technologies,</b> TowerJ had good performance, the JITs were fast in some cases, and readout with the Javalanguage was useful enough. The feasibility of Java-based DAQ has been discussed from the point of view of performance. INTRODUCTION Java[1] is a {{key technology}} of the next generation of DAQ.

40|$|TMN) {{has been}} {{developed}} as the framework to support administrations in managing telecommunications networks. It suggests the use of OSI Systems Management (OSI-SM) as the technology for management information exchanges. Distributed <b>object</b> <b>technologies,</b> such as the Common Object Request Broker architecture (CORBA), address the use of software application program interfaces (API’s) in addition to interoperable protocols. Their use in TMN {{has been the subject}} of intensive research in recent years, with most approaches focusing on interoperability aspects with OSI-SM. In this paper we examine the issues behind using distributed <b>object</b> <b>technologies</b> in TMN via a native fashion, with network elements supporting distributed objects directly, e. g., a “CORBA to the switch ” approach. The proposed solution tries to maintain the full OSI-SM expressive power in a way that other solutions have not attempted before.
