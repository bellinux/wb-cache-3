Around 300 BC, the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands, intermingling with the Jōmon.

40|$|Scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> {{is seen as}} {{the base}} from which {{governing}} bodies prepare standards <b>of</b> <b>practice,</b> educational institutions organize curricula and employers prepare job descriptions. The meaning <b>of</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> varies among and within healthcare professions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the concept <b>of</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> for dietetics in Saskatchewan and Canada. Little is known about dietetic scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> in Canada and literature has not shown a consistent use of the term. Saskatchewan is one of two provincial dietetic regulatory bodies without a scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> in legislation. Implications for having an undefined scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> include role confusion, competition among providers, diminishing professional identity and under- or over-utilization of health professionals. 	Using interpretative description methodology, data was collected through four phases. In Phase I, eight provincial dietetic regulatory bodies participated in semi structured telephone interviews on scope <b>of</b> <b>practice.</b> Phase II used an online survey on 92 Saskatchewan dietitians to examine dietetic scope <b>of</b> <b>practice.</b> A follow up online focus group was conducted with ten Saskatchewan dietitians in Phase III to further explore dietetic scope <b>of</b> <b>practice.</b> Phase IV related dietetic scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> statements found across Canada to literature and data collected in Phases I-III. Themes were defined as a topic identified by participants in more than one phase. Data from all phases were coded using NVivo 9. 0. 	Results indicate that dietetic scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> statements are a product of a complex multi-player, political process. Without a scope <b>of</b> <b>practice,</b> Saskatchewan dietitian participants were interpreting their role from a combination of documents (e. g. ethics, research) and stakeholders (e. g. employers and colleagues). Participants believed a dietetic scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> should provide guidance to dietitians, employers, health professionals, the public, regulatory bodies, and other stakeholders. Challenges defining, understanding and working with a scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> include encompassing the diversity of dietetics in a concise statement, and working with stakeholders who have a poor understanding of the dietetic profession. 	Our research also revealed variation in dietetic scopes <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> across Canada. A scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> cycle was proposed which included four phases: no scope <b>of</b> <b>practice,</b> creating a scope <b>of</b> <b>practice,</b> using a scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and evaluating and updating a scope <b>of</b> <b>practice.</b> Factors influencing a scope <b>of</b> <b>practice,</b> such as the political environment, education of professionals and employer policies all impact this scope <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> cycle.

5|$|After Denard Robinson {{left for}} the NFL, sophomore Russell Bellomy, the only {{scholarship}} quarterback on the roster other than Devin Gardner, endured a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury. The injury left the team without a healthy backup who had ever taken an official snap. True freshman Morris competed with redshirt freshman walk-on Brian Cleary for the backup role. On August 22, 2013 as a true freshman, Morris was named backup quarterback to redshirt junior Gardner. He made his debut for the 2013 team in the season opener against Central Michigan. Passing for 59 yards on 4-for-6 passing, {{he was one of}} 11 true freshmen to play in the game for Michigan. Morris also played in the Michigan–Michigan State football rivalry on November 2 against the 2013 Michigan State Spartans, completing only one pass (on three attempts) for six yards.

A similar concept of kusala (Sanskrit: kusala) is also known, which is different from merit in some details. The most fruitful form of merit-making is those good deeds done with regard to the Triple Gem, that is, the Buddha, his teachings, the Dhamma (Sanskrit: Dharma), and the Sangha. In Buddhist societies, a great variety <b>of</b> <b>practices</b> involving merit-making has grown throughout the centuries, sometimes involving great self-sacrifice. Merit has become part of rituals, daily and weekly practice, and festivals. In addition, there is a widespread custom of transferring merit to one's deceased relatives, of which the origin is still a matter of scholarly debate. Merit has been that important in Buddhist societies, that kingship was often legitimated through it, and still is.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{engineer}} and physicist Hannes Alfvén identified two fundamental prerequisites for effective management of high-level radioactive waste: (1) stable geological formations, and (2) stable human institutions {{over hundreds of}} thousands of years. As Alfvén suggests, no known human civilization has ever endured for so long, and no geologic formation of adequate size for a permanent radioactive waste repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period. Nevertheless, avoiding confronting the risks associated with managing radioactive wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude. Radioactive waste management is an example of policy analysis that requires special attention to ethical concerns, examined in the light of uncertainty and futurity: consideration of 'the impacts <b>of</b> <b>practices</b> and technologies on future generations'.|$|E
40|$|Drawing on the UK {{research}} project, ‘Farmers’ {{understandings of}} GM crops within local communities’, this paper considers {{the application of}} the concepts <b>of</b> communities <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and networks <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> in the agricultural context. A brief review of theories about communities <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and networks <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> is given and some of our findings are discussed in the context of those theories. Farmers were found to be a particular type <b>of</b> network <b>of</b> <b>practice,</b> characterised by a weak organisational framework but with a relatively stable network of other communities <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> (or networks <b>of</b> <b>practice)</b> they interact with, which we have called a ‘web of influencers on practice’. Together, farmers’ network <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and their web <b>of</b> influencers on <b>practice</b> represent the whole environment in which learning may occur, and so provide insights into their social learning system. Most farmers have to work at the boundary of their network <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and their web of influencers, which creates a significant load on their knowledge management. This is in contrast to other networks <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> where only some members take on this boundary brokering role. The paper concludes that these theories (on networks and communities <b>of</b> <b>practice)</b> provide a useful lens though which to view farmers and their practice, highlighting important points for policy. However, in such contexts these theories need to be extended to include the role of a broader 'web of influencers on practice'. ...|$|R
