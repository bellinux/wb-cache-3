5|$|As {{is typical}} of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European {{languages}} though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections. English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as have and do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting <b>of</b> <b>question</b> words beginning with wh-) and word order inversion with some verbs.|$|E
5|$|Character {{creation}} is done through a tutorial prologue that encompasses the different {{ages of the}} player's characters, which also covers tutorials on movement, the HUD, combat, interactions with the game world, {{and the use of}} the Pip-Boy 3000. The character's {{creation is}} done in steps, with the player first setting up their appearance along with what race and gender their character is, and the name they have. Next, they customize their character's primary attributes via the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system – Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck – which is retained in Fallout 3, and determines the base level of the Skills the game uses. What three skills their character focuses on can either be left to the choices they make with a series <b>of</b> <b>question,</b> or by choosing manually what they desire. Character creation is not finalized until the player finally leaves Vault 101 and enters the Capital Wastelands, allowing players the option to modify their character's appearance, primary attributes and Skill choices if they are not satisfied with their choices.|$|E

Several evaluations comprising of essay and structured essay types <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> are used {{for the evaluation of}} students. Since recent trends in medical education stresses the importance of promoting higher order thinking, such as analyzing and evaluating, rather than just remembering facts it was decided to conduct a study with a view to determining the cognitive level of the essay and structured essay type <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> in Forensic Medicine Method Essay and structured essay types <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> the first four years of the MBBS program from the year 2006 to 2012 were categorized according to the Bloom’s taxonomy. Results A majority <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> were knowledge based while a considerable number were of the comprehension and application types. The proportion <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> the synthesis and analysis were less while there was a moderate number of the evaluation type <b>of</b> <b>questions.</b> Observations made between the years revealed that there was a tendency for a decrease in the proportion <b>of</b> knowledge-based <b>questions</b> from the 1 st year to the 4 th years with an increase in the proportion of synthesis type <b>of</b> <b>questions.</b> Conclusion A majority <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> in Forensic medicine require lower cognitive abilities.

40|$|This study {{identified}} and analysed the functions <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> in BEL 120 classroom discourse in Universiti Teknologi MARA Pahang (UiTM). Thus, {{the data for}} the study mainly consisted of the audio tape recording transcriptions of five BEL 120 lecturers that were conveniently selected from July - November 2010 session. Altogether, a total of 20 hours of audio recordings were transcribed from these five lecturers selected. Each lecturer was recorded twice during the session. The data from the audio recording transcriptions were analysed based on the framework set for the investigation; the functions <b>of</b> <b>questions,</b> the types <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> and speech act. The questions found were analysed and categorized into nine different function adapted from Athanasiadou (1990), Tsui (1992), Gabrielatos (1997) and Thompson (1998) namely seek information, guidance and awareness raising, class management, feedback and checking, evoke students’ response, seek agreement and confirmation, introduce information, stimulating thought and unclassifiable. The functions were then treated to simple frequency counts. The analysis shows that out of the functions <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> listed to be analysed, most <b>of</b> the <b>questions</b> fall under the category of evoking students’ response function and seeking information. The functions <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> that seemed to be the least common used by the lecturers were introduce information and guidance and awareness-raising. The findings of this study have raised some legitimate concerns that BEL 120 lecturers did not use a lot <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> in the classroom. Some recommendations are put forward as a guide for future improvement towards enhancing the use <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> and various functions <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> in the classroom...|$|R
