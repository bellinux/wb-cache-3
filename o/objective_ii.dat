40|$|M. Cur. The {{learning}} accompanists (nurse educator), in the didactic situation {{within the}} context of a nursing college, is midst a process of transformation. This transformation has a direct influence on the learning accompanists didactic role fulfilment. Didactic support systems enables the learning accompanist to fulfil her/his didactic role. These didactic support systems should be managed during the process of transformation, in such a way that it enables the learning accompanist to fulfil her/his didactic role. A new creative approach to the management of the didactic situation is necessary. The goal of this study is to describe guidelines for the management of didactic support systems, at a nursing college, to enable the learning accompanist to fulfil her/his didactic role. An inductive, qualitative, contextual, exploring, descriptive strategy is used to reach the goal of the study. The background and rationale of the study are described, the problem is stated as well as a central theoretical statement. The assumptions of the study are described within the framework of the nursing theory for the whole person. No explicit theoretical assumptions are made, so that the researcher is open to empirical findings and to prevent pre-conceived ideas. The methodological assumptions is based on the Botes research model. No explicit conceptual framework is used as point of departure. Because the participants are midst a process of transformation, their knowledge and experience are used as source of data, as they can express their needs and views the best. The goal of this study is reached by setting four objectives. Objective I is to explore and describe the learning accompanists need for didactic support systems, {{within the context}} of a nursing college. <b>Objective</b> <b>II</b> is to explore and describe the managements views with regard to the way they can give didactic support, {{within the context of}} a nursing college. Objective III is to describe a conceptual framework. Objective IV is derived from objective I, <b>objective</b> <b>II</b> and objective III. Objective IV is the description of guidelines for the management of didactic support systems at a nursing college. To attain objective I, exploring is done by means of interviews with learning accompanist's. One semi-structured question is: "What are your needs for didactic support systems in the college?" To attain <b>objective</b> <b>II,</b> exploring is done by means of individual interviews with role players. One central question is set: "How can you give didactic support to the learning accompanist?" The interviews are conducted by an independent moderator/interviewer and assistant. Data is recorded by means of audio tapes and field notes, whereafter transcription takes place. Data is coded by the researcher and an assistent coder. The data analysis is done through a systematic approach of text analysis, as described by Tesch (in Cresswell, 1995 : 155). Thereafter the empirical findings of objective I and <b>objective</b> <b>II</b> are described. The interpretations are grounded by statements from the empirical data. Statements (n = 57) are formulated from the empirical findings of objective I and <b>objective</b> <b>II.</b> From these statements (n = 57) a list of concepts are generated. These concepts are utilized to attain objective III, the describing of a conceptual framework. The survey list of Dickoff, James and Wiedenbach (1968) is utilized to describe the conceptual framework in a structured manner. Data collection is done through a literature search to correlate the empirical findings with the literature. During the description of the conceptual framework conclusion statements (n = 15) are made. These conclusion statements are utilized to attain objective IV. Objective IV is to describe guidelines for the management of didactic support systems at a nursing college. Through logical inferention 12 guidelines and possible operationalisation of each are described. The uniqueness of the study lies in the relevance within the current time frame context and that it expresses the needs of the learner accompanists and the views of the managers at a nursing college. An abundance of possibilities for further research are created...|$|E

40|$|The surface {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) is {{an established}} diagnostic {{tool for the}} detection of abnormalities in the electrical activity of the heart. The interest of the ECG, however, extends beyond the diagnostic purpose. In recent years, studies in cognitive psychophysiology have related heart rate variability (HRV) to memory performance and mental workload. The aim of this thesis was to analyze the variability of surface ECG derived rhythms, at two different time scales: the discrete-event time scale, typical of beat-related features (Objective I), and the “continuous” time scale of separated sources in the ECG (<b>Objective</b> <b>II),</b> in selected scenarios relevant to psychophysiological and clinical research, respectively. Objective I) Joint time-frequency and non-linear analysis of HRV was carried out, with the goal of assessing psychophysiological workload (PPW) in response to working memory engaging tasks. Results from fourteen healthy young subjects suggest the potential use of the proposed indices in discriminating PPW levels in response to varying memory-search task difficulty. <b>Objective</b> <b>II)</b> A novel source-cancellation method based on morphology clustering was proposed for the estimation of the atrial wavefront in atrial fibrillation (AF) from body surface potential maps. Strong direct correlation between spectral concentration (SC) of atrial wavefront and temporal variability of the spectral distribution was shown in persistent AF patients, suggesting that with higher SC, shorter observation time is required to collect spectral distribution, from which the fibrillatory rate is estimated. This could be time and cost effective in clinical decision-making. The results held for reduced leads sets, suggesting that a simplified setup could also be considered, further reducing the costs. In designing the methods of this thesis, an online signal processing approach was kept, with the goal of contributing to real-world applicability.
