500|$|A former {{dancer and}} fixture on the New York club scene, Madonna Louise Ciccone became {{known to the}} world simply as Madonna, {{with the release of}} her 1983 self-titled debut album Madonna. Fueled by hit songs like [...] "Holiday", [...] "Borderline" [...] and [...] "Lucky Star", the album {{was one of the best}} selling of the year and helped Madonna become one of the most {{exciting}} new artists of the 1980s. When she started work on her second album, Madonna felt that her first album had succeeded in introducing her [...] "street-smart dance queen" [...] persona, and she wanted to solidify and build upon that concept. According to her, [...] "My work, my dedication—the stubbornness for getting Madonna released—had paid <b>off.</b> <b>Now</b> it was time to solidify my future." ...|$|E

It was a {{drop from the}} previous episode, [...] "Bop Gun", which drew 16.3 million household viewers, and Homicide dropped from the 10th highest-rated show of the week to the 31st highest-rated. But the ratings dip was expected due {{to the absence of}} Robin Williams and the [...] "See No Evil" [...] rating was nevertheless considered a strong one for the show, better than past Homicide episodes and the average rating for L.A. Law, the legal drama which previously occupied that NBC timeslot. [...] "See No Evil" [...] was outperformed in its timeslot by the ABC news series Primetime Live, which was the 11th highest-rated show of the week.

When I re-signed my contract I said, 'I love EastEnders, but I love my kids more'. Listen, I can imagine staying in the show till I'm in my 60s, but it's a full-on job. If they hadn't been prepared to give me time off, I'd have had to choose the kids."

If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on {{for the last four years}} is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment <b>off.</b> <b>Now,</b> with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
