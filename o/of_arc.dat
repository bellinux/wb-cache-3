5|$|The {{standard}} {{accounts of}} the life of Joan <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> have been challenged by revisionist authors. Claims made by such authors include: that Joan <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> was not actually burned at the stake; that she was secretly the half sister of King Charles VII; that she was not a true Christian but a member of a pagan cult; and that most of the story of Joan <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> is actually a myth. None of these claims are widely accepted by historians.|$|E
5|$|As {{they read}} the end, Joan <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> is being burnt at the stake, still waiting for God to save her (the real Joan had said several days earlier that her voices had spoken to her of martyrdom). Shocked, Lisa asks Homer if she was really burned to death. Marge then interrupts, {{claiming}} that Joan <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> was rescued by Sir Lancelot, and they get married and live in a spaceship. She then rips out the last page and eats it, remarking that {{it is easier to}} chew than the video of Bambi.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We give {{a theory}} {{on the space}} <b>of</b> <b>arcs</b> X ∞ <b>of</b> a {{singular}} variety X, based on the finiteness property of the stable points of X∞. We also show how computations {{can be made in}} this theory. As a consequence, we obtain a process of determining invariants of X from its space <b>of</b> <b>arcs</b> X∞, and from its spaces <b>of</b> wedges (<b>arcs</b> in the space <b>of</b> <b>arcs).</b> More precisely, we give two concepts of regularity for the stable points of X∞, and we show that we have regularity in codimension 1, and for all stable points of the space <b>of</b> <b>arcs</b> <b>of</b> a curve. As another application, we show concrete examples, obtained from the spaces <b>of</b> <b>arcs,</b> <b>of</b> Noetherian 1 -dimensional local rings which are analytically ramified. 1. Introduction.

40|$|These {{lecture notes}} have been {{prepared}} for the Summer school on ”Moduli spaces and arcs in algebraic geometry”, Cologne, August 2007. The goal is to explain the relevance <b>of</b> spaces <b>of</b> <b>arcs</b> to birational geometry. In the first section we introduce the spaces <b>of</b> <b>arcs</b> and their finite-dimensional approximations, the spaces of jets. In the second section we see how to relate the spaces <b>of</b> <b>arcs</b> <b>of</b> birational varieties. If f is a proper birational morphism between varieties Y and X, then the induced map f ∞ at the level <b>of</b> spaces <b>of</b> <b>arcs</b> is ”almost bijective”. The key result is the Birational Transformation Theorem, which shows that if X and Y are nonsingular, then the geometry of f ∞ is governed by the order of vanishing along the discrepancy divisor KY/X. In the third section we give some applications to invariants of K-equivalent varieties, and to {{the description of the}} log canonical threshold in terms of the codimensions of certain subsets in spaces <b>of</b> <b>arcs.</b> 1. Introduction to jet schemes and spaces <b>of</b> <b>arcs</b> In this section we construct the spaces <b>of</b> <b>arcs</b> and jets and prove some basic properties.

5|$|In 1429, when Isabeau {{lived in}} English-occupied Paris, the {{accusation}} was again put forth that CharlesVII {{was not the}} son of CharlesVI. At that time, with two contenders for the French throne—the young HenryVI and disinherited Charles—this could have been propaganda {{to prop up the}} English claim. Furthermore, gossip spread that Joan <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> was Isabeau and Orleans' illegitimate daughter—a rumor Gibbons finds improbable because Joan <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> almost certainly was not born for some years after Orléans' assassination. Stories circulated that the dauphins were murdered, and attempts were made to poison the other children, all of which added to Isabeau's reputation of one of history's great villains.|$|E
5|$|In July 1793, Southey {{discussed}} {{the story of}} Joan <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> with Grosvenor Bedford, his friend. The conversation led to him believe that Joan <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> {{would serve as a}} good basis for an epic so he began to work a plan for the poem and started composing lines. The subject of the poem appealed to Southey because it reflected incidents surrounding the French Revolution that started in early 1793. By 8 August, he had around 300lines of the poem written. On 13 August, he devoted his time to writing a 12-book poem that he hoped to complete by the end of September. After admitting this desire for haste in the preface to the poem's first edition, critics accused Southey of not spending enough time on composing the poem. During Summer 1794, Southey attempted to find a publisher for John <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> while taking up The Fall of Robespierre, a poetic drama about the French Revolution, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{consider}} the geometric probability problem of covering a circle with random arcs. We randomly place <b>arcs</b> <b>of</b> a fixed length on a circle of unit circumference. First we find the probability of covering the entire circle with a finite number <b>of</b> <b>arcs</b> <b>of</b> the same length and show some of its numerical values. Next we study the random variable describing {{the size of the}} covered part of the circle and the expected number <b>of</b> <b>arcs</b> needed to fully cover the circle if we place the arcs sequentially. Finally, we solve a similar problem of covering the circle by a countably infinite number <b>of</b> <b>arcs</b> <b>of</b> different lengths. ...|$|R
50|$|Proof. Form a digraph D(G) from graph G by {{dividing}} each edge of G into 2 arcs in opposite directions. We {{can see that}} the total number <b>of</b> <b>arcs</b> in D(G) is 2m. According to Guiduli, the incidence coloring of G is equivalent to proper coloring of the digraph D(G), where 2 distinct arcs '''' and '''' are adjacent if one of the following conditions holds: (i) u = x; (ii) v = x or y = u. By the definition <b>of</b> adjacency <b>of</b> <b>arcs,</b> an independent set <b>of</b> <b>arcs</b> in D(G) is a star forest. Therefore, a maximal independent set <b>of</b> <b>arcs</b> is a maximal star forest. This implies that at least '''' color classes are required.|$|R
5|$|Joan <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> {{puts the}} player {{in command of}} the battered, bloodied and demoralised French during the Hundred Years War against England. At the {{beginning}} of the campaign, nearly every major and decisive battle fought by the French has always led to defeat to the English. In France's darkest hour though, a seventeen-year-old girl—Joan <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> intends to save France by the command of God. She intends to drive the English from France forever. Her presence at the Siege of Orleans earns her the nickname 'The Maid of Orleans', and she earns the confidence of the uncrowned Dauphin Charles VII by being given command of the entire French Army, although the Dauphin's advisors begin to plot against Joan <b>of</b> <b>Arc.</b> At several turning points in the Hundred Years' War, namely the Loire Campaign where the entire English and Burgundian forces were cleared out, hope for a free France begin to inspire more men to join the fight under Joan <b>of</b> <b>Arc.</b>|$|E
5|$|A new {{parking lot}} has been {{constructed}} on college-owned land between Sullivan Arena and privately owned Clarke Farm in Bedford. This parking lot {{has replaced the}} former Joan <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> parking lot, which was located between the Dana Center, Davison Dining Hall, and the Joan <b>of</b> <b>Arc</b> dormitory (JOA). The former parking lot was torn down, and a grassy open quadrangle was constructed {{during the summer of}} 2012. A grotto has been built between JOA and Gadbois Hall and was dedicated in late 2014, with the placement of a religious statue. The quadrangle is yet to be named, and has new lights and walkways; the centerpiece is a large granite seal of the college. The project is the first place on campus where electronic gates have been installed. The gates are used to cordon off the roads of the new quad during the regular semester and can be opened for emergency vehicles and during move in/out days.|$|E

5|$|In 1670, Gabriel Mouton, a French abbot and astronomer, {{published}} the book Observationes diametrorum solis et lunae apparentium {{in which he}} proposed a decimal system of measurement of length for use by scientists in international communication, {{to be based on}} the dimensions of the Earth. The milliare would be defined as a minute <b>of</b> <b>arc</b> along a meridian and would be divided into 10 centuria, the centuria into 10 decuria and so on, successive units being the virga, virgula, decima, centesima, and the millesima. Mouton used Riccioli's estimate that one degree <b>of</b> <b>arc</b> was 321,185 Bolognese feet, and his own experiments showed that a pendulum of length one virgula would beat 3959.2 times in half an hour. Current pendulum theory shows that such a pendulum would have had an equivalent length of 205.6mm – using today's knowledge of the size of the earth, the virgula would have been approximately 185.2mm. He believed that with this information scientists in a foreign country would be able to construct a copy of the virgula for their own use.|$|E

Joan was originally a character that had a natural understanding of religion that was connected to a Socinian form of Christianity. She, as a child, was ignorant of Church and of theology except what was revealed to her directly. However, this was replaced in the second edition with Joan having a more traditional form of religion that was provided to her during her youth.|$|E
