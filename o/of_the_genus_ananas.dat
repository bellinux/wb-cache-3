5000|$|In the {{scientific}} binomial Ananas comosus, ananas, <b>the</b> original name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fruit, {{comes from the}} Tupi word nanas, meaning [...] "excellent fruit", as recorded by André Thevet in 1555, and comosus, [...] "tufted", refers to <b>the</b> stem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fruit. Other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ananas</b> <b>genus</b> are often called pine, as well, in other languages. In Spanish, pineapples are called piña ("pine cone"), or ananá (ananás) (for example, the piña colada drink).|$|R
40|$|Brazil is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main centers <b>of</b> {{origin of}} {{pineapple}} species presenting the largest genetic variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ananas</b> <b>genus.</b> Embrapa Cassava and Fruits is a Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation {{and has an}} ex-situ collection of 678 accessions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ananas</b> <b>genus</b> and some other Bromeliaceae. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> ornamental pineapple has increased {{in the last years}} demanding new varieties, mainly for the external market, due to the originality and colors of its tiny fruits. <b>The</b> main aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present study was describing accessions from the pineapple gene bank in order to quantify their genetic variation and identify possible progenitors to be used in breeding programs of ornamental pineapples. Eighty-nine accessions of Ananas comosus var. comosus, A. comosus var. bracteatus (Lindl.) Coppens et Leal, A. comosus var. ananassoides (Baker) Coppens et Leal, A. comosus var. erectifolius (L. B. Smith) Coppens et Leal, A. comosus var. parguasensis (Camargo et L. B. Smith) Coppens et Leal and A. macrodontes Morren were evaluated with 25 morphological descriptors. According to the results, the evaluated accessions were separated into the following categories: landscape plants, cut flower, potted plants, minifruits, foliage and hedge. The genetic distance among accessions was determined using the combined qualitative and quantitative data by the Gower algorithm. The pre-selected accessions presented genetic variation and ornamental potential for different uses. The multicategory analysis formed seven clusters through a classification method based on the average Euclidean distance between all accessions using <b>the</b> cut-point <b>of</b> genetic dissimilarity (D dg = 0. 35). The genotypes A. comosus var. erectifolius were selected to be used as landscape plants, cut flower, minifruits and potted plants. Accessions of A. comosus var. bracteatus and A. macrodontes were selected as landscape plants and hedge. The highest variation was observed in A. comosus var. ananassoides genotypes, which presented high potential for use as cut flowers.
