DSC measurements revealed that glass transition points of these <b>orthoborate</b> salts are in the temperature range from − 18 to − 2 °C. In addition, {{it was found that}} [EMPy][BScB] and [EMIm][BScB] salts have solid–solid phase transitions below their melting points, i. e. they exhibit typical features of plastic crystals. Salts of the bis(salicylato) borate anion [BScB]− have higher melting points compared with corresponding salts of the bis(mandelato) borate anion [BMB]−. Single crystal X-ray diffraction crystallography (for [Chol][BScB] crystals) and solid-state multinuclear (13 C, 11 B and 15 N) NMR spectroscopy were employed for the structural characterisation of [Chol][BScB], [EMPy][BScB] and [EMIm][BScB], which are solids at room temperature: a strong interaction between [BScB]− anions and [Chol]+ cations was identified as (i) hydrogen bonding between OH of [Chol]+ and carbonyl groups of [BScB]− and (ii) as the inductive C–Hπ interaction. In the other salt, [EMIm][BScB], anions exhibit ππ stacking in combination with C–Hπ interactions with [EMIm]+ cations.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} pyroborates, M 2 B 2 O 5, and <b>orthoborates,</b> M 3 (BO 3) 2, where M = Mg, Mn, Co, Ni, as high capacity and high voltage Li- and Mg-ion cathode materials. We explore the layered <b>orthoborates</b> (M 3 (BO 3) 2 which, to our knowledge, have not been previously considered as Li- or Mg-ion cathodes, perhaps {{due to the lack}} of Li analogues. Structural analysis shows that mixed metal <b>orthoborates</b> form a solid solution, with cation order driven by the presence of directional d orbitals. Electrochemical studies show that Mg can be removed from the structure and replaced with Li in a 1 : 1 ion ratio. In the compound Mg 2 Mn(BO 3) 2 removal of 1 Mg is achieved giving a capacity of 209. 9 mAh g 1. The pyroborates (M 2 B 2 O 5) are an unexplored family of borate polyanions, which offer higher theoretical capacities and voltages than LiMBO 3 due to their more condensed frameworks. There are no known Li containing pyroborates, we use electrochemical ion exchange, with the aim of replacing each Mg with 2 Li to form LixMB 2 O¬ 5. The stoichiometry can be varied to alter the redox couple utilised and the Mg available for removal. MgxM 2 -xB 2 O 5 has been synthesised for M = Mn, Co, Fe and Ni and all forms have been shown to form a solid solution with cation ordering over the two M sites. In MgMnB 2 O 5 we have shown that Mg can be fully removed while retaining the pyroborate structure. Subsequently up to 1. 1 Li can be inserted giving discharge capacities of 240 mAhg- 1 above 1. 5 V. After 100 ’s of cycles 2 Li can be reversibly cycled. The insertion of Li has been confirmed by 7 Li NMR and the oxidation state changes in Mn have been investigated by SQUID magnetometry and XANES spectroscopy. Electrochemical studies in materials where M = Fe, Co, and Ni show high voltage plateaus (> 3. 5 V) but limited capacity at room temperature. Increased temperatures improves cycling, with Co and Fe based compounds reaching full theoretical capacities (> 200 mAhg- 1). As Mg can be removed from the structure, the pyroborates could be of interest in Mg-ion batteries, which offer benefits in energy density, cost, and safety. Mg-ion battery research is still in its infancy, therefore here we develop methods to reliably test Mg-ion cathodes and electrolytes. We demonstrate that despite significant side reactions, Mg can be reversibly cycled in the MgMnB 2 O 5 system in a full Mg-ion cell, showing that pyroborates are a promising family of materials for high capacity, high voltage Mg-ion cathodes. This study shows that the pyroborates and <b>orthoborates</b> are a promising family of materials for Li- and Mg-ion cathodes, with the light weight structure leading to high specific capacities.

40|$|An {{ionic liquid}} (IL) is a salt, which usually {{is in the}} liquid state at normal {{temperature}} and pressure. The properties of ILs can be adjusted for various processes and applications by choosing different combinations of ions. Similar to other salts, ILs contain only ions with positive (cations) and negative (anions) charges in equal proportions. However, to prevent solidification, ions in ionic liquids usually contain bulky organic chemical groups, which, apart from electrostatic interactions, promote other types of interactions between ions, such as: (i) van-der-Waals interactions; (ii) hydrogen bonding; (iii) - stacking, etc., depending on the particular chemical structure of the ions. All these interactions, in combination, may lead to formation of specific microstructures in ILs, which may vary with temperature caused by changing thermal rotational and translational energies of the ions. Ions in these microstructures may have preferential orientations relative to each other, maintain anisotropic properties {{similar to those in}} liquid crystals or, in some specific cases, may even separate into microscopically organised liquid phases. Therefore, the dynamics of ILs may also be dependent on their microstructure. In many practical applications ionic liquids are placed on surfaces or in confinements. Solid surfaces introduce extra forces, which may be specific to the charge of the ions or/and to functional groups in the ILs. The geometry and interactions of ions in confinements or/and pores of materials may also disrupt specific bulk microstructures of ILs. Both confinement effects and interactions of ions with surfaces are manifested in the translational dynamics of the ions. One of the most direct and informative methods to study translational dynamics of ILs is pulse-field-gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR). In this thesis the results of PFG-NMR studies on a few classes of ILs are reported: (i) the historically “standard” (since Walden’s discovery in 1914) ionic liquid, the ethylammonium nitrate (EAN) and (ii) halogen-free orthoborate-based phosphonium, imidazolium and pyrrolidinium ILs with varied structure and lengths of alkyl chains in cations, and varied structures of <b>orthoborate</b> anions. These ILs were studied in bulk at different temperatures, and also in confinements, such as between parallel glass and Teflon plates and in mesoporous Vycor glass. It was found that diffusion coefficients of cations and anions in EAN, phosphonium and pyrrolidinium <b>orthoborate</b> ILs in bulk are different, but according to the standard Stocks-Einstein model, they correspond to diffusion of ions in homogeneous liquids. A change in the chemical structure of one of the ions results in a change in both the diffusion coefficient of the oppositely charged ion and the activation energy of diffusion for both ions in an IL. Similar effects were observed from the chemical shifts and diffusion coefficients measured by NMR for imidazolium <b>orthoborate</b> ILs dissolved in polyethylene glycol solutions, in which imidazolium cations strongly interact with PEG molecules, further affecting the diffusion of <b>orthoborate</b> anions via electrostatic interactions. A liquid-liquid phase separation was suggested for a few phosphonium and pyrrolidinium bis(mandelato) borate ILs, in which a divergence of diffusion coefficients and activation energies of diffusion for cations and anions was detected at temperatures below ca 50 °C. In addition, a free-volume theory was invoked to explain the dependences of density of ILs on the alkyl chain length in cations. It was also found that for a phosphonium bis(salicylato) borate IL confined in 4 nm mesoporous Vycor glass the diffusion coefficients of ions increase by a factor of 35 ! This phenomenon was explained by the dynamic heterogeneity of this IL in micropores and empty voids of the Vycor glass. For EAN IL in confinements between glass and Teflon plates, the diffusion of ethylammonium cations and nitrate anions is significantly anisotropic, i. e. slower {{in the direction of the}} normal to the plates and faster along the plates compared to diffusion of the ions in bulk. A plausible explanation of this PFG NMR data is that EAN forms layers near polar and non-polar solid surfaces. A similar phenomenon, to a lesser extent, was also observed for phosphonium cations of bis(mandelato) borate, bis(salicylato) borate and bis(oxalato) borate confined between glass plates. The results of these studies may have implications in modeling tribological performance, i. e., friction and wear reduction for contact pairs of different materials lubricated by various classes of ionic liquids.

Particular care is given to extracting clean spectra from the data, and it is demonstrated that excellent results can be obtained even from measurements that appear corrupted by several effects such as poor crystal quality and multiple scattering.

40|$|A novel {{environmentally}} friendly bis-functional dicationic ionic liquid containing chelated <b>orthoborate</b> was synthesized and polycondensed with glutamic acid {{in order to}} synthesize inorganic-organic carbon dots (CD/IL) consisting of an ionic liquid moiety inserted in the carbon skeleton. The obtained CD/IL {{was found to be}} a new kind of nitrogen/boron-codoped nanomaterial, one with a mean particle diameter of 2. 66 nm. CD/IL was verified to be a high-performance lubricant additive: in particular, the anti-wear and friction-reducing properties of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were improved by 89. 34 % and 62. 18 %, respectively, when 1 % CD/IL was added. Lubricants consisting of a mixture of CD/IL and PEG showed intense blue photo-fluorescence, and the corresponding photoluminescence (PL) intensity decreased considerably after carrying out a tribo-test. Moreover, CD/IL became transferred onto a rubbing steel interface during the tribo-test according to EDX and Raman analyses of a worn surface. CD/IL showed poor crystallinity, and interestingly, an intense G (similar to 1600 cm(- 1)) signature was detected on the steel surface after a high-load and long-duration tribo-test, which indicated that ordered carbon materials were generated on the interface, inhibiting the undesirable wear...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of vanadium oxide {{on the structure}} of 3 B 2 O 3 ·SrO glasses was investigated by Raman spectroscopy. The addition of V 2 O 5 in strontium borate glasses determines the formation of <b>orthoborate</b> groups. Raman spectroscopy is an effective tool for resolving the structure of local arrangement in glasses. The samples were prepared by melting the admixtures of H 3 BO 3, SrCO 3 and V 2 O 5 (in suitable proportions) at 1523 K. Vitrification was achieved by rapid cooling of the melts at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. In order to obtain Raman spectra, the 514. 4 nm line of an Ar+ laser (Spectra Physics 2016) was used. An Olympus microscope objective (Olympus ULWD 80, NA 0. 75) was used to focus the laser beam as well as to collect the backscattered light. The laser power was 400 mW at the sample. A Dilor XY Raman triple monochromator with a Peltier cooled CCD camera and a spectral slit width of 2 cm- 1 was used.

40|$|Ionic liquids {{are very}} {{promising}} replacements {{for the traditional}} volatile organic solvents because of their unique physicochemical properties and designability. 1 The cation and anion of ILs can be varied and combined in nearly infinite ways which lead to a quite large number of different compounds with unique desirable properties. Correspondingly, the properties of ILs including viscosity, solubility and melting point etc. could be adjusted. Therefore, understanding the relationship between basic physical properties and molecular structure characteristics of ILs is one of key issues for ILs’ design, evaluation and successful use. In this work, two chelated <b>orthoborate</b> ionic liquids (ILs) 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(oxalato) borate ([Bmim][BOB]) and 1 -hexyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(oxalato) borate ([Hmim][BOB]) were prepared 2 and studied by using adiabatic calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. Their thermodynamic properties and phase change behavior were compared with other series of [Bmim] based ionic liquids. Results indicate that their heat capacities increase with the increasing in atom number of anion. Glass-transition temperature of ILs is normally affected by ion size and the charge dispersion degree. High content of strong electro negative atoms and Cn or Cnv (n = 1, 2, 3,…,∞) point group symmetry in the anion is recommended for the design room temperature ILs with wide liquid temperature range. 中国科学院大连化学物理研究...|$|E
40|$|Newly {{synthesised}} halogen-free boron based ionic liquids (hf-BILs) {{composed of}} chelated <b>orthoborate</b> anions and phosphonium cations have hydrolytic stability, low melting point and outstanding wear and friction reducing properties. We report here {{the peculiarities of}} self-diffusion in one representative from this class, trihexyltetradecylphosphonium bis(mandelato) borate, [P 6, 6, 6, 14][BMB], in the temperature range of its practical interest, 20 – 100 °C. NMR techniques demonstrated complicated diffusional behaviour – the ionic liquid can exist {{in one or two}} liquid “phases”. In the low-temperature range (20 – 50 °C), two phases coexist where the cations, [P 6, 6, 6, 14], are contained mainly in the phase with slower diffusion coefficients while the anions, [BMB], are in the phase with faster diffusion coefficients. Cations have lower diffusion coefficients with a factor of 20 as compared with the anions, an effect which is caused by aggregation of cations into domains due to so-called “hydrophobic interaction” of their hydrocarbon chains. As the temperature rises above 60 °C, the two phases merge into one where both ions have equal diffusion coefficients. This is caused by thermal motion making the cation domains smaller in size and more easily interacting with anions. As a result, anions and cations diffuse in this high-temperature range as a pair...|$|E
40|$|The {{anomalous}} (τ < 10 ns) luminescence of wide bandgap crystals of lithium-gadolinium <b>orthoborate</b> Li(6) GdB(3) O(9) doped with trivalent cerium ions, {{has been}} revealed {{for the first}} time and investigated through the low-temperature time-resolved vacuum ultraviolet synchrotron spectroscopy. It was shown that the optical transitions at 6. 2 eV are due to electron transfer from the ground 4 f(1) states of Ce(3 +) ion onto the autoionized states near the conduction band bottom of a crystal. These transitions lead to the formation of impurity-bound excitons in the form of correlated electron-hole pair, in which the hole component is localized at 4 f-level of the cerium ion and an electron component is located at the conduction band bottom in the attractive potential of this hole. It is established that the direct radiative recombination of the cerium impurity-bound exciton leads to a fast broadband emission at 4. 25 eV. The energy threshold for creation of the impurity-bound excitons was determined on the basis of the obtained spectroscopic data. We calculated the H(k) functions of distribution of the elementary relaxations over the reaction rate constants and explained on this basis the decay kinetics and quenching processes, not only for the anomalous emission at 4. 25 eV, but for the ordinary 5 d- 4 f luminescence at 3. 0 eV in Ce(3 +) ions. The paper discusses the decay channels for the impurity-bound excitons and their influence on the decay kinetics and spectra of luminescence in Li(6) GdB(3) O(9) crystals...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of cooperative action of commercial fire retardants is interpreted as resulting from specific chemical reaction and phase changes. This investigation {{focuses on the}} thermally initiated interactions between two forms of commercially available fire retardant compounds. The fire performance of a polyolefin with a metal hydroxide fire retardant, magnesium hydroxide, can significantly reduce the heat release rate through absorption of heat during conversion to its metal oxide. Formation of water, followed by vaporisation, decreases heat and dilutes volatiles from polymer degradation. The second form of fire retardant compounds are zinc borates (2 ZnO· 3 B 2 O 3 · 3 H 2 O and 4 ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O), that undergo dehydration with increasing temperature. Differential thermal analysis and wide-angle X-ray spectroscopy indicated that various structural changes occurred during heating. Endothermic transitions were observed for all components, while zinc borate (2 ZnO· 3 B 2 O 3 · 3 H 2 O) showed an exothermic crystallisation transition at relatively high temperature. The exotherm was modified {{by the development of}} a new crystalline phase, magnesium <b>orthoborate</b> (3 MgO·B 2 O 3) that formed on reaction with magnesium oxide (MgO) at temperatures greater than 500 °C. Formation of crystalline zinc oxide (ZnO) was also detected. From zinc borate (4 ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O), ZnO was primarily formed. No new crystalline phases were observed in the presence of MgO over the temperature range investigated...|$|E

Six magnetic nickel $Ni^{ 2 +}$ ions (S= 1) in the unit cell are distributed over the 2 a and 4 f positions in the centers of distorted $[O_{ 6 }]$ octahedra. The $[NiO_{ 6 }]$ units are linked via rigid $[BO_{ 3 }]$ groups and these structural particularities impose restrictions on the lattice dynamics and spin-phonon interactions. We performed the symmetry analysis of the phonon modes at the center of the Brillouin zone. The structural parameters and phonon modes were calculated using Dmol 3 program. We report and analyze results of infrared and Raman studies of phonon spectra measured in all required polarizations. Most of the even and odd phonons predicted on the basis of the symmetry analysis and theoretical calculations were reliably identified in the measured spectra. Absorption measurements in the infrared region showed emergence of several very narrow and weak phonons at the magnetic ordering temperature $T_{N}$. This observation proves the existence of a structural phase transition not reported before which is evidently coupled intrinsically with the magnetic dynamics of $Ni_{ 3 }(BO_{ 3 }) _{ 2 }$. A clear evidence of spin-phonon interaction was observed for some particular phonons below $T_{N}$. Comment: New version: 29 pages, 10 figures, 73 reference...|$|E
40|$|The {{lifespan}} {{and efficiency}} of various types of machinery is often limited by the performance of its lubricated interfaces, which are formed by two interacting surfaces and a lubricant that separates the surfaces to decrease friction and wear. There is a constant quest for more efficient lubricants capable of lubricating non-ferrous surfaces. Ionic liquids (ILs) possess many unusual physicochemical properties compared to molecular liquids including, but not limited to, high polarity, high conductivity, high thermal stability, and a wide liquid range. Such properties are essential for formulating lubricants for interfaces in challenging applications such as in aerospace and wind turbines. Some ILs have recently shown promising performance in lubricating lightweight non-ferrous alloys and hard coatings, among other materials. However, most of the widely studied ILs contain anions with fluorine, such as [BF 4]- and [PF 6]-, and are prone to hydrolysis, releasing toxic HF, among other corrosive products. In this work, we designed, synthesized, and thoroughly characterized a number of hydrophobic ILs based on halogen-free and hydrolytically-stable <b>orthoborate</b> anions and different classes of cations such as pyrrolidinium and imidazolium. The potential of these ILs to efficiently lubricate ferrous and non-ferrous interfaces was investigated. The work was planned and carried out through the following steps: Design, synthesis and purification of novel, halogen-free, boron-based ionic liquids (hf-BILs). Physicochemical characterization of the synthesized compounds by liquid-state (1 H, 13 C, and 11 B) and solid-state (13 C and 11 B) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Karl Fischer titration, mass spectroscopy, elemental analysis, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), thermal analysis (TGA, DSC), powder X-ray diffraction, density and rheological measurements. Evaluation of their lubrication performance using ball-on-disc tribometers. Analysis of the lubricated surfaces using Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with X-ray Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) and a stylus profilometer. A {{detailed description of the}} results obtained for selected classes of ILs is given below: I. Nine novel ILs of N-alkyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(salicylato) borate ([CnC 1 Pyrr][BScB]) were synthesized and physicochemically characterized. They are solids at room temperature and some of them behave as plastic crystals. Some of these compounds were tested as neat lubricants in steel-steel interfaces at 423 K, i. e., above their melting points. The tested compounds showed significantly better anti-wear and friction-reducing performance compared with 5 W 40 engine oil. II. Eight novel, room-temperature N-alkyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(mandelato) borate ([CnC 1 Pyrr][BMB]) ILs were synthesized and physicochemically characterized. Their lubrication potential as 3 wt% additives in polyethylene glycol (PEG) was evaluated in steel-steel interfaces at room temperature. Considerably better anti-wear and friction-reducing properties were achieved when compared with neat PEG and 5 W 40 engine oil. III. Three novel, room-temperature 1 -alkyl- 3 -methyl-imidazolium bis(mandelato) borate ([CnC 1 Im][BMB]) ILs were synthesized and physicochemically characterized. IV. A room-temperature trihexyltetradecylphosphonium bis(oxalato) borate [P 6, 6, 6, 14][BOB] IL, was evaluated as a neat lubricant for alumina-steel and sapphire-steel interfaces at room temperature. [P 6, 6, 6, 14][BOB] provided lower friction and wear compared with 5 W 40 engine oil.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{derivatives}} of the brominated alcohol 3 -bromo- 2, 2 - bis(bromomethy 1) - 1 -propanol were prepared {{with a view}} to eventual use of such derivatives as flame retardants. The derivatives took the form of alkoxide compounds of main group elements, except for a few compounds of non-main group elements, which were added for their known application in the flame retardant field. Many of these derivatives were liquids at room temperature, so were of limited use for flame retarding polymers etc., but were of interest due to the trends shown in their spectra. Of the solid derivatives, the fully substituted monomeric boron and silicon compounds were tested by high temperature DSC & TGA techniques. The silicon derivative showed potential for application in ABS-type polymers, and would be worthy of further study. The simple <b>orthoborate</b> did not perform as well. The other solid species produced were tested by DSC to 400 C and the results reviewed. Derivatives of the brominated diol 2, 2 -bis(bromomethyI) -l, 3 - propanediol were also prepared, with the same aim. Some reactions of tetrahydroborate with 1, 2 -dihydroxybenzene or sulphur were studied. The spirocyclic bisdiol borate anion was successfully prepared via this route, although the target of the monodioldihydro species was not formed. The reactions with sulphur were aimed at producing an active borane-type species, but were also of interest for the structural problems they raised. No definite conclusions were reached regarding the product of these reactions, however. Some work was also performed on a novel route to carboranes by reacting a carbene with a borane anion. The preliminary reactions did not indicate the presence of any carborane species...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce our fossil based energy {{consumption}} there is an urge for new energy storage and conversion devices such as lithium batteries and fuel cells for more efficient energy use. The heart of these devices is an ion conducting electrolyte which needs to provide high performance at low cost. This thesis focuses on new electrolyte materials; the first part concerns lithium salts with prospects to increase the performance and safety of lithium batteries, {{and the second part}} deals with protic ionic liquids (pILs), a new electrolyte material for low temperature fuel cells. By combining high accuracy quantum mechanical calculations with vibrational spectroscopy, an increased understanding of the properties of these new materials was obtained. This knowledge is important in the development of improved materials. Two promising types of binary lithium salts were investigated; lithium salts incorporating one (azole type) and two (<b>orthoborate</b> type) ring structures with pending electron drawing groups for charge delocalisation. The calculated lithium binding energies of both these types of salts are 10 - 15 % lower than for the lithium salt used in batteries today. From the calculated and characterised salt structures new improved salts have been proposed for synthesis at collaborating laboratories, completing our feedback cycle. An oligomeric lithium salt with single ion conducting properties was investigated to pinpoint structural features limiting the lithium ion transport in these special systems. pILs are non-volatile low temperature melting salts with high proton conductivity, formed by proton transfer from an acid to a base, that can swell polymers even at elevated temperatures. pILs thus has the potential to replace both the role of water and the ionomer part in polymer electrolyte membranes and improve the fuel cell efficiency considerably. By calculating molecular level properties an increased understanding of important macroscopic properties for fuel cell performance such as melting temperature, fluidity and conductivity was obtained...|$|E
