40|$|The term {{financial}} crisis {{refers to the}} loss of confidence in a country's currency or other financial assets causing international investors to withdraw their funds from the country. The {{financial crisis}} and associated recession originated in the US in early 2008 and then spread to Europe has by now engulfed most of the economies in both developed and developing world. There is every possibility of direct as well as indirect implications of the crisis on all the economies of the world. The crisis has affected the entire global economies in one way or other. The present study makes an attempt to identify the immediate impact of the financial crisis on major world economies especially Indian economy in terms of selected economic indicators. The study examines the trends in export, import, foreign remittances, earnings from business services, <b>overall</b> <b>Balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>Payment</b> position, GDP growth rates etc in the context of Indian economy against the background of global financial crisis and subsequent global recession. India is considered to be highly vulnerable to a crisis like this because of its greater integration {{with the rest of the}} world. The study shows that there are some reasons to believe that the financial crisis affected Indian economy adversely by slowing foreign remittances, foreign investment, adverse BoP position etc. However, Indian economy shows the symptoms of rapid recovery from the sudden set back it had to undergo during 2008 - 09. ...|$|R

50|$|Since independence, India's {{balance of}} {{payments}} on its current account has been negative. Since liberalisation in the 1990s (precipitated by a balance of payment crisis), India's exports have been consistently rising, covering 80.3% of its imports in 2002-03, up from 66.2% in 1990-91. Although India is still a net importer, since 1996-97, its <b>overall</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> (i.e., including the capital account balance), has been positive, largely on account of increased foreign direct investment and deposits from non-resident Indians; until this time, the overall balance was only occasionally positive on account of external assistance and commercial borrowings.

40|$|Abstract <b>Balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>Payments</b> (BoP), being {{a record}} of the {{monetary}} transactions over a period {{with the rest of the}} world, reflects all payments and liabilities to foreigners and all payments and obligations received from foreigners. In this sense, the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> is one <b>of</b> the major indicators of a country's status in international trade. As its strength and sustainability significantly affect the economic policies of a government and global competitiveness, every country strives to a have a favorable <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> and maintains its long run sustainability. India’s <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> position was quite unfavorable during the time of country’s entry into liberalized trade regime.

40|$|In recent years, {{a number}} of {{countries}} have introduced currency boards (CBs). Gaining in swing and popularity, this new generation CB preserves, to varying degrees, the Central Bank’s ability to function as the lender of last resort (LOLR) and to intervene in case of systemic risk. Recently, Central Bank flexibility has been preserved in different forms in Hong Kong, Argentina, Estonia, Lithuania and Bulgaria. Macro- and microeconomic implications of such departures from orthodox CBs have not been thoroughly studied yet. Theoretically, the introduction of this second-generation CB provides an opportunity for conducting discretionary monetary policy (though certainly not in its typical form). Some major, ensuing questions require answers. What are the new channels of monetary policy? Does an orthodox self-regulating (automatic) mechanism work with second-generation CBs? How are monetary disequilibria in the economy adjusted? We define an automatic mechanism as “the presence of a positive cointegration relationship between the <b>overall</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> (BOPs) and the reserve money, and the absence of discretionary variables in the model. ” The theoretica...|$|E
