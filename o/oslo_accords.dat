5|$|Jurisdiction {{over the}} city was {{handed over to the}} Palestinian National Authority on December 12, 1995, {{as a result of the}} <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> Interim Agreement on the West Bank. Nablus is {{surrounded}} by Israeli settlements and was site of regular clashes with the IDF during the First Intifada when the local prison was known for torture.|$|E

5|$|When the First Intifada {{broke out}} in 1987, Deir al-Balah's {{residents}} participated in the uprising against Israeli rule. Around 30 residents were killed during the uprising, which formally ended in 1993 with the <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel. In 1994 Deir al-Balah was the first city to officially come {{under the control of}} the Palestinian National Authority as a result of the Gaza–Jericho Agreement.|$|E
5|$|From 1977 until 1991, Said was an {{independent}} {{member of the}} Palestinian National Council (PNC). In 1988, he was a proponent of the two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict (1948), and voted {{for the establishment of}} the State of Palestine {{at a meeting of the}} PNC in Algiers. In 1993, Said quit his membership to the Palestinian National Council, to protest the internal politics that led to the signing of the <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> (Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, 1993), which he thought had unacceptable terms, and because the terms had been rejected by the Madrid Conference of 1991.|$|E
5|$|In September 1993, {{leaders of}} Israel and the PLO signed the <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> calling for Palestinian {{administration}} of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city. Led by Yasser Arafat, the PNA chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.|$|E

5|$|Said {{disliked the}} <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> for not {{producing}} an independent State of Palestine, {{and because they}} were politically inferior to a plan that Yasir Arafat had rejected—a plan Said had presented to Arafat {{on behalf of the}} U.S. government in the late 1970s. Especially troublesome to Said was his belief that Yasir Arafat had betrayed the right of return of the Palestinian refugees to their houses and properties in the Green Line territories of pre-1967 Israel, and that Arafat ignored the growing political threat of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories that had been established since the conquest of Palestine in 1967.|$|E
5|$|The major {{agricultural}} products are strawberries, citrus, dates, olives, flowers, and various vegetables. Pollution and high demand for water {{have reduced the}} productive capacity of farms in the Gaza Strip. Small-scale industries include the production of plastics, construction materials, textiles, furniture, pottery, tiles, copperware, and carpets. Since the <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords,</b> thousands of residents have been employed in government ministries and security services, UNRWA and international organizations. Minor industries include textiles and food processing. A variety of wares are sold in Gaza's street bazaars, including carpets, pottery, wicker furniture, and cotton clothing. The upscale Gaza Mall opened in July 2010.|$|E

Finne-Grønn, Povel Hansson was almost certainly {{the father of the}} priests Hans Povelsson Paus (1587-1648) and Peder Povelsson Paus (1590-1653), two brothers from Oslo who were the progenitors of the Paus family.|$|R

5|$|Bethlehem {{became part}} of Jund Filastin {{following}} the Muslim conquest in 637. Muslim rule continued in Bethlehem until its conquest in 1099 by a crusading army, who replaced the town's Greek Orthodox clergy with a Latin one. In the mid-13th century, the Mamluks demolished the city's walls, which were subsequently rebuilt under the Ottomans in the early 16th century. Control of Bethlehem passed from the Ottomans to the British {{at the end of}} World War I. Bethlehem came under Jordanian rule during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and was later captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Since the 1995 <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords,</b> Bethlehem has been administered by the Palestinian Authority.|$|E
5|$|The {{interval}} between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline. The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime {{body of work}} rather than a single achievement. The Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work. For example, 2008 laureate Martti Ahtisaari was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts. However, {{they can also be}} awarded for specific recent events. For instance, Kofi Annan was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Similarly Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin, and Shimon Peres received the 1994 award, about a year after they successfully concluded the <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Arafat and leading Fatah {{officials}} engaged the Israeli {{government in a}} series of secret talks and negotiations that led to the 1993 <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords.</b> The agreement called for the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in portions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip over a five-year period, along with an immediate halt to and gradual removal of Israeli settlements in those areas. The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule. Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government. Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication.|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} community regards {{all of the}} Palestinian territories including Gaza as occupied. Human Rights Watch has declared at the UN Human Rights Council that it views Israel as a de facto occupying power in the Gaza Strip, even though Israel has no military or other presence, because the <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accord</b> authorizes Israel to control the airspace and the territorial sea.|$|R

5|$|From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based {{himself in}} Tunisia, {{and began to}} shift his {{approach}} from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories. He engaged {{in a series of}} negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> and the 2000 Camp David Summit. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of Hamas and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.|$|E
5|$|Gaza {{experienced}} destructive earthquakes in 1903 and 1914. In 1917, during World War I, British forces {{captured the}} city. Gaza grew {{significantly in the}} first half of the 20th century under Mandatory rule. The population of the city swelled as a result of the Palestinian exodus during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Gaza came under Egyptian rule until it was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six Day War. Gaza became a center of political resistance during the First Intifada, and under the <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> of 1993, it was assigned to be under the direct control of the newly established Palestinian Authority. Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005. By 2007, Hamas emerged both as the victor in Palestinian elections and in factional fighting with rival Fatah in the city and in the wider Gaza Strip and has since been the sole governing authority. Israel subsequently blockaded the Strip and launched assaults against it in 2008–2009, 2012 and 2014, as a response to rocket attacks.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Arafat {{moved to}} Gaza City, which was {{controlled}} by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)—the provisional entity created by the <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords.</b> Arafat became the President and Prime Minister of the PNA, the Commander of the PLA and the Speaker of the PLC. In July, after the PNA was declared the official government of the Palestinians, the Basic Laws of the Palestinian National Authority was published, in three different versions by the PLO. Arafat proceeded with creating a structure for the PNA. He established an executive committee or cabinet composed of twenty members. Arafat also replaced and assigned mayors and city councils for major cities such as Gaza and Nablus. He began subordinating non-governmental organizations that worked in education, health, and social affairs under his authority by replacing their elected leaders and directors with PNA officials loyal to him. He then appointed himself chairman of the Palestinian financial organization that {{was created by the}} World Bank to control most aid money towards helping the new Palestinian entity.|$|E

25|$|The {{assassination}} of Yitzhak Rabin {{took place on}} 4 November 1995 (12th of Marcheshvan, 5756 on the Hebrew calendar) at 21:30, {{at the end of}} a rally in support of the <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> at the Kings of Israel Square in Tel Aviv. The assassin, an Israeli ultranationalist named Yigal Amir, radically opposed Rabin's peace initiative and particularly the signing of the <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords.</b>|$|E
25|$|Peres {{was perhaps}} more closely {{associated}} with the <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> than any other Israeli politician (Rabin included) {{with the possible exception of}} his own protégé, Yossi Beilin. He remained an adamant supporter of the <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> and the Palestinian Authority since their inception despite the First Intifada and the al-Aqsa Intifada (Second Intifada). However, Peres supported Ariel Sharon's military policy of operating the Israeli Defense Forces to thwart suicide bombings.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accords</b> ceded {{control of}} the {{airspace}} and territorial waters to Israel. Any external travel from Gaza requires cooperation from either Egypt or Israel.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{a number}} of rabbis have {{allegedly}} suggested that various public figures could qualify as rodfim, arguably encouraging one to kill. Perhaps most notoriously, former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was branded a rodef by some for the <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accord,</b> an agreement {{for which he was}} assassinated in 1995. The assassin, Yigal Amir, subsequently justified his actions partly on the basis of din rodef, under the assumption that making concessions to the Palestinian Authority would endanger Jewish lives.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, the Palestinian National Authority, <b>according</b> to <b>Oslo</b> <b>Accord</b> {{assigned}} by PLO and the Israeli government, became a partial supervisor over the Rafah Border Crossing to Gaza Strip.

According to the agreement, Israel {{has the right to}} independently inspect luggage and to maintain security. In addition, it can prevent anyone from using the crossing.|$|R
