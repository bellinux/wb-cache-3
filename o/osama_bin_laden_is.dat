[...] Commenting on the legality under international law, University of Michigan Law Professor Steven Ratner said, [...] "A lot of it depends on whether you believe <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>is</b> a combatant in a war or a suspect in a mass murder."

2500|$|According to Christopher Hitchens, Moore {{had argued}} in a {{previous}} public debate that Osama bin Laden was to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and thus questions the treatment of bin Laden in the film.

Indeed, Osama is suddenly so guilty and so all-powerful that any other discussion of any other topic is a dangerous 'distraction' from the fight against him.

2500|$|When CNN {{presenter}} Jeff Greenfield {{was asked}} why Chomsky was never on his show, {{he claimed that}} Chomsky might [...] "be {{one of the leading}} intellectuals who can't talk on television. [...] If you got a 22-minute show, and a guy takes five minutes to warm up, [...] he's out". Greenfield described this need to [...] "say things between two commercials" [...] as the media's requirement for [...] "concision". Chomsky has elaborated on this, saying that [...] "the beauty of [...] is that you can only repeat conventional thoughts. If you repeat conventional thoughts, you require zero evidence, like saying <b>Osama</b> <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>is</b> a bad guy, no evidence is required. However, if you say something that is true, although not a conventional truth, like the United States attacked South Vietnam, people are going to rightfully want evidence, {{and a whole lot of}} it, as they should. The format of the shows do not allow this type of evidence which is one of the reasons concision is critical." [...] He's continued that if the media were better propagandists they would invite dissidents to speak more often because the time restraint would stop them from properly explaining their radical views and they [...] "would sound like they were from Neptune." [...] For this reason, Chomsky rejects many offers to appear on TV, preferring the written medium.|$|E
