40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{finite element}} based method for static {{parameter}} identification of structures is presented for the systematic identification of plate-bending stiffness parameters for a one-third scale, reinforced-concrete pier-deck model. The plate-bending stiffnesses {{of the pier}} deck are identified at the element level by using static test data on {{a subset of the}} degrees of freedom used to define the finite element model. The finite element model of the reinforced-concrete pier deck is generated by using three-dimensional isoparametric elements to model the beams, and hourglass plate-bending elements to model the <b>orthotropic</b> <b>slab.</b> Several parameter identification examples are performed on the pier deck using simulated static force and displacement measurements. The level of acceptable er-ror is investigated for the convergence of the algorithm. Probabilistic parameter identification is performed to simulate an actual test setup. It is believed that con-tinued research of this approach of static parameter identification will lead to a practical procedure for damage assessment and load-carrying capacity determina-tion of full-scale structures...|$|E

The effect of the columns {{on the free}} vibrations of the plate is taken into account by replacing the columns with their restraining forces acting on the plate so that continuity of plate-column system is preserved, and this problem of vibrations of <b>orthotropic</b> flat <b>slabs</b> is strictly solved based on the fundamental differential equation for tbe orthotropic plate, the theory of which {{is applied to the}} reinforced concrete slab due to M.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} paper, a {{simplified}} model for hand verification of the flexural and shear strength of existing corroded T beams cast {{in place of}} lightened R. C. <b>orthotropic</b> <b>slabs</b> forming floors is presented and discussed. Diffused and pitting corrosion on steel bars, compressive concrete strength degradation and concrete bond strength degradation {{are included in the}} model. The original contribution of the paper is evaluation of the flexural and shear strength considering both the cases of strain compatibility and absence of compatibility and considering the main parameters governing the corrosion process. An arch-resistant model for the calculus of the flexural and shear strength of the beam was adopted in the absence of strain compatibility, while the plane section theory was adopted for the case of strain compatibility. No punching shear is considered. This approach is simple and can be applied {{on the basis of the}} experimental information available (carbonation test, chloride content, measurement of the pitting in the bar, gravimetric method for general corrosion) or by utilizing analytical expressions calibrated on the knowledge of the corrosion current intensity determined by linear polarization resistance measurement (LPR). The model was also verified against experimental results recently obtained by the authors...|$|R
40|$|The {{philosophy}} of design of structures by picturing statically admissible states is outlined {{and applied to}} various members and structures. The strength of bolted joints under eccentric loading is investigated. The concept of thrust line is applied to multi story bay frames and space frames, and a graphical method of minimum weight design by guessing points of inflexion is presented. Various solutions for the load-carrying capacity of <b>orthotropic</b> <b>slabs</b> are proposed. The strength and safety of the Gladesville Arch Bridge is investigated; the load factors for the bridge are established for three different loading conditions. An experimental method for directly obtaining a shape for an arch dam under a given loading condition is proposed. Load-carrying capacity of arch dams are also estimated by picturing various statically admissible states. The relation between deflexion, buckling, and strength is discussed. The concept of Non-Euler Buckling is introduced. Various practical design considerations are summarized, including the detailed design of joints.

40|$|When an {{orthotropic}} {{composite slab}} cast on steel decking {{is subjected to}} fire attack, there is a decreasing temperature gradient from the bottom surface to the top surface. In addition, the temperature within the continuous upper portion of the slab varies in the horizontal sense due {{to the presence of}} the ribs. This makes it different from a flat slab. In this study, using a layered 9 -noded iso-parametric slab element and a 3 -noded beam element, an <b>orthotropic</b> <b>slab</b> element is developed to model orthotropic slabs in fire. The element is assembled from a solid slab element which represents the continuous upper portion of the profile, and a special beam element which represents the ribbed lower portion. An equivalent width for the cross-section of this beam element is determined according to the dimensions of the cross-section of the ribbed profile, and the beam shares the nodes of the solid slab element. Slight modifications are applied to the slab and beam models. The temperature within each layer of the slab element can vary between adjacent Gauss integration points so as to reflect the temperature gradients in the horizontal plane. It is reasonable to ignore the torsional resistance of the beam element, because it actuall...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} reported {{the performances of}} a numerical simulation model [1] that calculates the mechanical displacements induced within a sample by the absorption of a laser pulse. This model solves the heat diffusion and acoustic wave propagation equations over an <b>orthotropic</b> <b>slab</b> of finite thickness {{with the help of}} temporal Laplace and spatial 2 D Fourier transformations. The parallel and normal displacements predicted by the model were found to be in generally very good agreement with experimental data obtained on various samples in various excitation conditions. Among these experiments, one consisted in the CO 2 laser excitation of a graphite-epoxy sample. We performed an optical study of the graphite-epoxy composite using FTIR photoacoustic spectroscopy [2] to determine the optical penetration depth spectrum of this material. This study revealed that a thin (≈ 30 μm thick) epoxy layer covered the top graphite fiber sheet of the composite, and that the optical penetration depth of the CO 2 radiation in the epoxy was about 20 μm. Consequently, when a CO 2 laser pulse impinges on the composite, all the radiation is absorbed in the epoxy layer, and it is easy to simulate this situation with the model, using the rigidity-expansion tensor [λ] of the epoxy for the generation and the rigidity tensor [C] of the composite for the propagation (see [1]) ...|$|E
40|$|Circular voids {{are often}} {{incorporated}} into concrete bridge decks {{to reduce their}} self-weight without greatly reducing the flexural stiffness. Incorporating voids within a slab offers many advantages over a conventional solid concrete slab, for example a lower total cost of construction, reduced material use, and enhanced structural efficiency. The advantages of this topology are obvious, however the voids within the slab complicate {{the analysis of the}} structure. The incorporation of the voids within the slab results in different flexural stiffness in the longitudinal and transverse directions, resulting in an <b>orthotropic</b> <b>slab.</b> Another feature which distinguishes voided slabs from other common bridge types is the deformable nature of their cross-sections, which influences the load distribution of the structure. The need for a method of analysis which accounts for the orthotropic behaviour and deformable nature of the cross-section has been suggested by many in the past. The idealisation of voided slabs as an orthotropic plate {{has been the subject of}} extensive research. When modelling a voided slab as an orthotropic plate, it is necessary to calculate the reduction in the longitudinal and transverse stiffness due to the presence of the voids. Several equivalent plate parameters, which take on numerous forms, have been suggested by various authors to account for the effect of the voids. No research has been reported in technical literature to compare these different methods employing orthotropic plate parameters. Key shortcomings to these methods include the lack of definition of the suggested equivalent plate parameters, and the geometrical parameters of voided slabs which influence their behaviour. In an attempt to address these limitations, the aim of this study is to verify and validate the effect of the void diameter ratio and void spacing on the structural behaviour of voided slabs, which are the main influences on the orthotropic behaviour and cross-section deformation. The different methods of analysis using orthotropic plate theory suggested by various authors employing equivalent plate parameters are compared and discussed. The objectives of the study were achieved based on the finite element approach using ABAQUS. Finite element models with a void diameter to slab depth ratio range of 0. 5 to 0. 9, and a void spacing range of 0. 9 m to 2. 7 m were considered and analysed. Comparisons were made of the longitudinal and transverse stress distribution results from these models in order to draw conclusions. Results from solid models using both isotropic and orthotropic materials based on the equivalent plate parameters suggested from literature are also presented for comparison in order to verify the methods suggested by the technical literature for the analysis of voided slab bridge decks. Results of the finite element modelling show that the addition of voids causes large variations to the transverse stress distribution from the typical parabolic transverse stress distribution shape, leading to large peak transverse stresses in the flanges above and below the voids. These variations are due to the deformable nature of the cross-section. The voids also lead to a stress raising effect on the longitudinal stresses. It was found that an increase in void diameter to slab thickness ratio results in a rapid increase in both the longitudinal and transverse stresses, which shows that there is an increase in orthotropic behaviour and deformation of the cross-section with an increase in void diameter ratio. From the results, it can be concluded that the optimal void diameter ratio is between 0. 6 and 0. 8. This range of void diameter ratios allow for greater efficiency due to reduced dead load and material use, without generating excessive stresses due to cellular distortion resulting from excessively thin and flexible flanges above and below the voids. The spacing of the voids was found to have minimal effect on the stress distributions for a logical void spacing. These results show that the orthotropic behaviour and deformation of the cross-section are more sensitive to variations in void diameter ratio than the spacing of the voids. The void diameter ratio should therefore form the basis of the equivalent plate parameters for the use of orthotropic plate theory. The use of a solid orthotropic plate to idealise a voided slab showed reasonable agreement with the results from three-dimensional models, with some discrepancies in the different authors' methods noted. The net effect of using a two-dimensional analysis is the averaging out of the stress transverse distribution, which cannot predict the peak stresses around the voids. The orthotropic models compared more favourably with the 3 D model than the isotropic models with increasing void diameter ratio. The results presented have shown that the incorporation of voids begins to affect the structural behaviour of the slab once the void diameter ratio exceeds 0. 6, and the orthotropic behaviour becomes considerable. The stress raising effect of the voids should therefore be accounted for in the analysis of a voided slab once the void diameter ratio exceeds 0. 6. It is recommended that a solid isotropic slab can be used to idealise a voided slab when the void diameter to slab depth ratio is less than 0. 6. When the void diameter ratio is greater than 0. 6, the transverse stiffness should be evaluated independently from the longitudinal stiffness, and orthotropic models are more suitable. For higher void diameter ratios, the method employed by Sen et al. (1994), which employs a reduced depth solid <b>orthotropic</b> <b>slab</b> in conjunction with stress multipliers, was found to be the most accurate method for idealising voided slabs. It is evident from this study, that while a three-dimensional finite element model may be too complex for everyday use, it may be extremely valuable for determining the local effects due to the presence of the voids...|$|E
