5|$|Although {{the output}} of copper {{currency}} had expanded immensely by 1085, some fifty copper mines were shut down between the years 1078 and 1085. Although there were on average more copper mines found in Northern Song China {{than in the previous}} Tang dynasty, this case was reversed during the Southern Song with a sharp decline and depletion of mined copper deposits by 1165. Even though copper cash was abundant in the late 11th century, Chancellor Wang Anshi's tax substitution for corvée labor and government takeover of agricultural finance loans meant that people now had to find additional cash, driving up the price of copper money which would become scarce. To make matters worse, large amounts of government-issued copper currency exited the country via international trade, while the Liao dynasty and Western Xia actively pursued the exchange of their iron-minted coins for Song copper coins. As evidenced by an 1103 decree, the Song government became cautious about its outflow of iron currency into the Liao Empire when it ordered that the iron was to be alloyed with tin in the smelting process, thus depriving the Liao <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> melt down the currency to make iron weapons.|$|E

25|$|This {{short-lived}} {{attempt at}} colonization, via the American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project, begun when American colonists arrived aboard the USCGC Itasca, the same vessel that brought colonists to neighboring Howland Island, on April 3, 1935. They built a lighthouse and substantial dwellings, and {{they attempted to}} grow various plants. The settlement was named Meyerton, after Captain H.A. Meyer of the United States Army, who helped establish the camps in 1935. One sad-looking clump of coconut palms was jokingly called King-Doyle Park after two well-known citizens of Hawaii who visited on the Taney in 1938. This clump was the best on the island, planted near a water seep, but the dry climate and seabirds, eager for anything upon which to perch, did not give the trees or shrubs much <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> survive. King-Doyle Park was later adopted as a geographic name by the USGS. Its population was four American civilians, {{all of whom were}} evacuated in 1942 after Japanese air and naval attacks.

As he was under contract, Pollard was threatened with legal action from General Manager Vince McNally.

Pollard explained his rationale in a 1954 interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer: [...] "I just got fed up... I knew they wouldn't give me much <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> play...

The Browns got out to a fast start, scoring two touchdowns in the first quarter and adding two more in the second while holding the Bills scoreless. Buffalo came back in the third quarter, scoring two touchdowns of its own, but Cleveland held its lead. Browns coach Paul Brown criticized the {{performance}} after the game, saying the team had failed to keep pace in the second half after he rotated in some of his younger players. [...] "We got a good head of steam and took a commanding lead {{in the first half and}} then let down and looked bad in the last two periods," [...] he said. Buffalo quarterback George Ratterman felt pressure from Cleveland's defense the whole game, and said the Browns were better than the Chicago Bears, who had won the 1946 NFL Championship Game the previous season. [...] "Their line rushed me all night long and I didn't have much <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> get the ball away accurately," [...] Ratterman said. [...] "I think the Browns are much better than the Bears, especially their line." [...] Placekicker Lou Groza had his extra point blocked after the Browns' first touchdown.

500|$|Cousy {{was one of}} six freshmen on the Holy Cross Crusaders' varsity {{basketball}} team in 1946–47. From {{the start of the}} season, coach Doggie Julian chose to play the six freshmen off the bench in a two-team system, so that each player would get some time on the court. As members of the [...] "second team", they would come off the bench nine and a half minutes into the game, where they would relieve the [...] "first team" [...] starters. They would sometimes get to play as much as a third or even half of the game, but even at that Cousy was so disappointed with the lack of playing time that he went to the campus chapel after practice to pray that Julian would give him more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> show off his talents on the court. Early in the season, however, he got into trouble with Julian, who accused him of being a showboater. Even as late as that 1946–47 season basketball was a static game, depending on slow, deliberate player movement and flat-footed shots. Far different was Cousy's up-tempo, streetball-like game, marked by ambidextrous finesse play and notable for behind-the-back dribbling and no-look, behind-the-back and half-court passing. Even so, he had enough playing time in games to score 227 points for the season, finishing with the third-highest total on the team. Led by stars George Kaftan and Joe Mullaney, the Crusaders finished the 1946–47 basketball season 24–3.|$|E
500|$|Despite another mid-table {{finish in}} 1971–72, Stoke beat Chesterfield, Tranmere Rovers, Hull City and Manchester United to reach another FA Cup semi-final. They again faced Arsenal, {{and once more}} a draw at Hillsborough meant a replay at Goodison Park. The Gunners' goals in a 2–1 victory came from a disputed Frank McLintock penalty and a John Radford goal that {{television}} replays showed was clearly offside. In a May 2011 interview, Banks said that he still felt [...] "cheated" [...] out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> play for the club in an FA Cup final. Stoke and Banks found solace in the League Cup, though it took them 11 matches to reach the final after overcoming Southport, then Oxford United in a replay, Manchester United in a second replay, Bristol Rovers, and then West Ham United in a second replay following an aggregate draw after two legs. In extra-time of the second leg with West Ham, Banks fouled Harry Redknapp, conceding a penalty, and then saved Geoff Hurst's powerful spot-kick to keep City in the competition. They then faced Chelsea in the final at Wembley. Peter Osgood beat Banks with a hooked shot just before half-time, but goals from Terry Conroy and George Eastham won Stoke the game 2–1. At {{the end of the}} season Banks was named as the FWA Footballer of the Year, becoming the first goalkeeper to receive the honour since Bert Trautmann in 1956.|$|E
500|$|Winfield's tenure {{with the}} team ended when he was traded in May 1990. The 1990 team lost 95 games to finish {{at the bottom of}} the AL East, and its [...]414 winning {{percentage}} was the franchise's worst since 1913. The Yankees underwent a dramatic change in their front office that year, which Glenn Stout cites as a turning point for the club. Winfield had become a target of Steinbrenner in previous years. At one 1985 game, he criticized Winfield by calling him [...] "Mr. May", that is, a player who only performed well early in the season. Steinbrenner also resented Winfield's salary as too high, and was critical of a charitable foundation run by him. A gambler was paid by Steinbrenner [...] "for damaging information" [...] about Winfield, an incident that resulted in an indefinite suspension from then-commissioner Fay Vincent in 1990. Under new general manager Gene Michael, the Yankees allowed their minor league talent more time to improve their skills and more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> play for the Yankees if they were good enough. Michael focused on on-base percentage in deciding which hitters to pursue, and emphasized left-handed batters who might take advantage of Yankee Stadium's short right-field porch. The players developed by the team during its rebuilding years included outfielder Bernie Williams, a future AL batting average leader, and a group—Derek Jeter, Andy Pettitte, Jorge Posada, and Mariano Rivera—that became the centerpiece of the championship teams of the 1990s, and was later nicknamed the [...] "Core Four".|$|E

Benfica scored first with a header by Cristian Rodríguez, but Tiago Valente tied the game {{a few minutes later}} for Paços. In the 85th minute, Kostas Katsouranis scored Benefica's winning goal with an assist by Rodríguez. To Camacho, the win was [...] "difficult but very important". On 6 November, Benfica played Celtic on the road. In their second game against the team, Benfica lost 1–0 on a goal by Aiden McGeady. With the loss, Benfica was in last place and needed to defeat Milan to remain in the Champions League. Although Camacho was optimistic, he was aware of the high stakes. On 11 November, Benfica hosted Boavista in search of their fourth {{consecutive}} win in the Primeira Liga. Cardozo scored in the first half, with Boavista tying the score in the 58th minute. Benfica then scored five goals in the final 40 minutes for a 6–1 win. After the match, Rui Costa said, [...] "We had our fourth consecutive win in the Primeira Liga, and I think we are on the right track." [...] After a third international break, Benfica resumed on the 24th with an away game against Académica. Lito scored first for Académica, but a free kick by Rui Costa tied the game. Académica goalkeeper Ricardo made two errors, allowing Luisão and Adu to score Benfica's second and third goals, and Camacho credited the late win to his players' perseverance and commitment. November ended with a decisive match against Milan. Andrea Pirlo scored for Benfica, but Maxi Pereira's 23th-minute shot tied the game. Benfica's fate was determined by events in Glasgow, as Celtic defeated Shakhtar Donetsk with an added-time goal. Camacho bemoaned his team's luck: [...] "We're a bit unhappy. For what we did in this competition I think we should have had more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> go through, so for me football has not been fair to Benfica." ...|$|E
