5|$|In November 1912, a {{bill was}} publicised under the LER name that {{included}} a plan to extend the Piccadilly tube tracks westwards from Hammersmith to connect to the L's Richmond branch tracks. The District line already ran trains over this route, and the Piccadilly tube service would provide additional connections. The bill received assent as the London Electric Railway Act, 1913 on 15 August 1913. The advent of World War I prevented work on the extension starting. Post-war, a shortage of funds and <b>other</b> <b>priorities</b> meant that the extension was postponed until the early 1930s.|$|E

5|$|During the campaign, Combs had {{advocated}} a progressive platform that included increased funding for education, highways, parks, industry, and airports. Soon after his election, he won {{approval for a}} three-percent sales tax to pay a bonus to military veterans, although he could have funded the bonuses with a one-percent tax. He had asked for the larger tax in order to fund his <b>other</b> <b>priorities.</b> As {{a result of the}} sales tax, Combs presided over the state's first billion-dollar budget. One study showed that Kentucky doubled its per capita expenditures between 1957 and 1962, growing its appropriations faster than any other state. Combs held large public relations events for each tax-funded project that was completed, declaring in dedication speeches that the sales tax had made the project possible.|$|E
5|$|One other point, already mentioned, {{was how to}} {{deal with}} the problem of {{rendering}} the poem’s fourth line. Gray remarked to Anstey, “’That leaves the world to darkness and to me’ is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, and therefore, I believe, you were in the right to drop it.” In fact, all that Anstey had dropped was reproducing an example of zeugma with a respectable Classical history, but only in favour of replicating the same understated introduction of the narrator into the scene: et solus sub nocte relinqor (and I alone am left under the night). Some other translators, with <b>other</b> <b>priorities,</b> found elegant means to render the original turn of speech exactly.|$|E
5|$|Speaking on the {{evolving}} relationship of Clark and Chloe, Mack {{believes that the}} season six introduction of Jimmy Olsen into Chloe's life increased her value to Clark. Before, Chloe would drop anything for Clark, but now that Chloe has <b>other</b> <b>priorities,</b> it makes Clark realize how valuable she is to him. The introduction of Jimmy Olsen also provides Chloe with someone she can finally have a romantic relationship with. The relationship is strained when Chloe has to lie to cover up Clark's secret, as well as keeping {{the fact that she}} is meteor-infected hidden. Writer Holly Harold questions whether or not Jimmy has taken over the place in Chloe's heart that Clark occupied for so long.|$|E

5|$|The Act left range {{management}} policy unresolved in many respects, {{although it did}} specify that BLM and the Forest Service consult with state wildlife agencies. In practice, BLM struggled to accommodate the needs of feral horses among its <b>other</b> <b>priorities</b> (which included livestock grazing, prevention of soil erosion, and accommodating big game hunting). In November 1971, the BLM announced a major effort to save the Pryor Mountain herd from starvation after a poor summer growing season left vegetation on the range stunted.

25|$|Due to the {{outbreak}} of the First Muslim Civil War and <b>other</b> <b>priorities,</b> the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century.
