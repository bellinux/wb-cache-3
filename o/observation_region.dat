In many practical applications, relocatable objects tend to appear often; therefore, models for them can be learned offline and stored in a database. We formulate an occluder-centric representation, called a graphical model layer, where a person’s motion in the ground plane is defined as a first-order Markov process on activity zones, while image evidence is aggregated in 2 D <b>observation</b> <b>regions</b> that are depth-ordered with respect to the occlusion mask of the relocatable object. We represent real-world scenes as a composition of depth-ordered, interacting graphical model layers, and account for image evidence in a way that handles mutual overlap of the <b>observation</b> <b>regions</b> and their occlusions by the relocatable objects. These layers interact: Proximate ground-plane zones of different model instances are linked to allow a person to move between the layers, and image evidence is shared between the <b>observation</b> <b>regions</b> of these models. We demonstrate our formulation in tracking pedestrians in the vicinity of parked vehicles. Our results compare favorably with a sprite-learning algorithm, with a pedestrian tracker based on deformable contours, and with pedestrian detectors.

40|$|Tracking {{multiple}} targets using fixed cameras with non-overlapping views is {{a challenging}} problem. One {{of the challenges}} is predicting and tracking through occlusions caused by other targets or by fixed objects in the scene. Considerable effort has been devoted toward developing appearance models that are robust to partial occlusions, tracking algorithms that cope with short-term loss of observations, and algorithms that learn static occlusion maps. In this thesis we consider scenarios where {{it is impossible to}} learn a static occlusion map. This is often the case when the scene consists of both people and large objects whose position is not permanently fixed. These objects may enter, leave or relocate within the scene during a short time span. We call such objects "relocatable objects" or "relocatable occluders. " We develop a representation for scenes containing relocatable objects that can cause partial occlusions of people in a camera's field of view. In many practical applications, relocatable objects tend to appear often; therefore, models for them can be learned off-line and stored in a database. We formulate an occluder-centric representation, called a graphical model layer, where a person's motion in the ground plane is defined as a first-order Markov process on activity zones, while image evidence is aggregated in 2 D <b>observation</b> <b>regions</b> that are depth-ordered with respect to the occlusion mask of the relocatable object.

These layers interact: proximate ground plane zones of different model instances are linked to allow a person to move between the layers, and image evidence is shared between the <b>observation</b> <b>regions</b> of these models. We demonstrate our formulation in tracking low-resolution, partially-occluded pedestrians in the vicinity of parked vehicles. In these scenarios some tracking formulations that rely on part-based person detectors may fail completely. Our pedestrian tracker fares well and compares favorably with the state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors [...] -lowering false positives by twenty-nine percent and false negatives by forty-two percent [...] -and a deformable-contour [...] based tracker...|$|R

The facility is a combustion-driven shock tunnel, which is cheaper to build than the facilities in which such experiments are carried out conventionally. The <b>observation</b> <b>region</b> is a zone between two parallel flat plates with a 33 wedge attached to the upstream end of the bottom plate. Gaseous hydrogen is injected at an angle of 45 into an oncoming supersonic flow of Mach 2 (approximate) from a port on the bottom plate. The resulting flow field is visualized by a high speed camera in a dark background. Three different test gases, namely nitrogen, air, and oxygen-rich air are used, {{and the results are}} compared. A distinct luminosity due to combustion for oxygen-containing test gases is observed. Heat-transfer rates on a probe placed at the down-stream end of the <b>observation</b> <b>region</b> and midway between the parallel plates are measured and compared for the three cases.
