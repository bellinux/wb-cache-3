40|$|Abstract. In this paper, low cis-butadiene (LCPB) {{is used in}} {{the process}} of {{polymerization}} of HIPS to study the influence of the polymerization condition on the particle size of rubber and mechanical property. It can be discovered from the study that the particle size was increased from 300 nm to 500 nm with the decreasing stir. The test of mechanical property shows that with the increase of content of rubber, elongation at break and impact strength on cantilever increase, but stretching strength decreases. On condition of 100 rpm, when the content of rubber increases from 3 % to 9 %, elongation at break increases from 21. 9 % to 25. 0 %, stretching strength decreases from 30. 5 MPa to 23. 9 MPa, and the cantilever impact strength increases from 5. 4 KJ/m 2 to 9. 3 KJ/m 2. On condition of 200 rpm, when the content of rubber increases from 3 % to 9 %, elongation at break increases from 21. 4 % to 29. 1 %, stretching strength decreases from 28. 7 MPa to 20. 8 MPa, and the cantilever impact strength increases from 5. 2 KJ/m 2 to 8. 1 KJ/m 2. High-impact polystyrene (HIPS) is a heterogeneous material obtained by polymerizing styrene (St) in the presence of polybutadiene (PB).

40|$|We {{present a}} {{procedure}} for attaining resolution beyond the diffraction limit in ground-based telescopes. This procedure {{is based on}} the use of rotationally symmetric pupil plane filters that can be easily implemented in dynamic optical devices such as a deformable mirror of an adaptive-optics system. We show that a successful application of the technique requires partial compensation for atmospheric distortion by adaptive optics. Con-sequently, we derive the required level of compensation {{as a function of the}} atmospheric conditions. Finally, our results are checked using simulated data. © 2004 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 100. 6640, 010. 1080, 220. 1230. Astronomers demand larger telescopes because of their superior gathering ability and higher resolution. However, the latter advantage can be attained in current telescopes by use of superresolution tech-niques at a low cost, since a deformable mirror of an adaptive-optics system can be used for this task. In such a case, although the Strehl ratio decreases, the resolution presents a moderate <b>improvement</b> (<b>fo...</b>|$|R
40|$|Multi-core and many-core {{systems are}} the norm in {{contemporary}} processor technol-ogy {{and are expected to}} remain so for the foreseeable future. Parallel programming is, thus, here to stay and programmers have to endorse it if they are to exploit such systems for their applications. Programs using parallel programming primitives like PThreads or OpenMP often exploit coarse-grain parallelism, because it offers a good trade-off between programming effort versus performance gain. Some parallel ap-plications show limited or no scaling beyond a number of cores. Given the abundant number of cores expected in future many-cores, several cores would remain idle in such cases while execution performance stagnates. This thesis proposes using cores that do not contribute to performance improvement for running implicit fine-grain speculative threads. In particular, we present a many-core architecture and protocols that allow applications with coarse-grain explicit parallelism to further exploit implicit specula-tive parallelism within each thread. We show that complementing parallel programs with implicit speculative mechanisms offers significant performance <b>improvements</b> <b>fo...</b>|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT: The phrase 2 ̆ 2 Science <b>of</b> <b>Improvement</b> 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 Improvement Science 2 ̆ 2 is {{commonly}} used today by a range of people and professions to mean different things, creating confusion to those trying to learn about improvement. In this article, we briefly define the concepts <b>of</b> <b>improvement</b> and science, and review {{the history of the}} consideration of 2 ̆ 2 improvement 2 ̆ 2 as a science. METHODS: We trace key concepts and ideas in improvement to their philosophical and theoretical foundation with a focus on Deming 2 ̆ 7 s System of Profound Knowledge. We suggest that Deming 2 ̆ 7 s system has a firm association with many contemporary and historic philosophic and scientific debates and concepts. With reference to these debates and concepts, we identify 7 propositions that provide the scientific and philosophical foundation for the science <b>of</b> <b>improvement.</b> FINDINGS: A standard view of the science <b>of</b> <b>improvement</b> does not presently exist that is grounded in the philosophical and theoretical basis of the field. The 7 propositions outlined here demonstrate the value of examining the underpinnings <b>of</b> <b>improvement.</b> This is needed to both advance the field and minimize confusion about what the phrase 2 ̆ 2 science <b>of</b> <b>improvement</b> 2 ̆ 2 represents. We argue that advanced scientists <b>of</b> <b>improvement</b> are those who like Deming and Shewhart can integrate ideas, concepts, and models between scientific disciplines for the purpose of developing more robust improvement models, tools, and techniques with a focus on application and problem solving in real world contexts. CONCLUSIONS: The epistemological foundations and theoretical basis of the science <b>of</b> <b>improvement</b> and its reasoning methods need to be critically examined to ensure its continued development and relevance. If improvement efforts and projects in health care are to be characterized under the canon of science, then health care professionals engaged in quality improvement work would benefit from a standard set of core principles, a standard lexicon, and an understanding of the evolution of the science <b>of</b> <b>improvement...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{the spatial}} {{properties}} of highdefinition (HD) videos are investigated {{based on a}} large set of HD video sequences. Compared with lower resolution videos, the prediction errors of HD videos have higher correlation. Hence, we propose using 2 -D order- 16 transforms for HD video coding, which {{are expected to be}} more efficient to exploit this spatial property, and specifically propose two types of 2 -D order- 16 integer transforms, nonorthogonal integer cosine transform (ICT) and modified ICT. The former resembles the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and is approximately orthogonal, of which the transform error introduced by the nonorthogonality is proven to be negligible. The latter modifies the structure of the DCT matrix and is inherently orthogonal, no matter what the values of the matrix elements are. Both types allow selecting matrix elements more freely by releasing the orthogonality constraint and can provide comparable performance with that of the DCT. Each type is integrated into the audio and video coding standard (AVS) Enhanced Profile (EP) and the H. 264 High Profile (HP), respectively, and used adaptively {{as an alternative to the}} 2 -D order- 8 transform according to local activities. At the same time, many efforts have been devoted to further reducing the complexity of the 2 -D order- 16 transforms and specially for the modified ICT, a fast algorithm is developed and extended to a universal approach. Experimental results show that 2 -D order- 16 transforms provide significant performance <b>improvement</b> <b>fo...</b>|$|R
