5|$|Doggett, searching in the salvage yard, finds a Chamber Technologies drum, {{inside of}} which is a metal corpse. When Scully and Doggett confront Pugovel about it, he admits it was Dr. Clifton, a doctor who mysteriously disappeared. He had {{requested}} that he be put in the barrel in order to not ruin the company or slow the research. Doggett and Scully realize that Ray was exposed to the barrel, and thus was transformed into a metal human. At the same time, Doggett notices Nora Pearce at the lab, looking through files for the person responsible. Later, the halfway house is raided by the FBI to find Pearce. Larina finds Ray and he puts one hand <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> to muffle, but he kills her by accident.|$|E
5|$|The Pharisee Nicodemus {{supports}} Christ {{as he is}} lowered, and can {{be identified}} by his similarity to Simon the Pharisee in another canvas attributed to Bouts, Christ in the House of Simon. The Virgin wears a white headdress and a dark blue dress with a yellowish mantle, and holds Christ's arm just above his wrist as if afraid {{to let go of}} her dead son. She is supported by John the Evangelist, who wears a red robe. Dressed in green robes, Mary Salome stands to the Virgin's left, wiping tears from her face with the fold of her white headdress. Mary of Clopas is behind them, holding a red cloth <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> while the Magdalen is in the foreground at Christ's feet, dressed in a heavily folded cloak. The man in the brown–green tabard at the feet of Christ is probably Joseph of Arimathea, who, according to Gospel, brought Christ's body to Golgotha from Pontius Pilate.|$|E
25|$|Pathologist Luca Lalli, from Perugia's {{forensic}} science institute, performed the autopsy on Kercher's body. Her injuries consisted of sixteen bruises and seven cuts. These included several bruises {{and a couple}} of insubstantial cuts on the palm of her hand. Bruises on her nose, nostrils, mouth, and underneath her jaw were compatible with a hand being clamped <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and nose. Lalli's autopsy report was reviewed by three pathologists from Perugia's {{forensic science}} institute who interpreted the injuries, including some to the genital region, as indicating an attempt to immobilize Kercher during sexual violence.|$|E
60|$|It was so unutterably {{still and}} perfect with promise, the golden-lighted, {{distinct}} land, that Ursula's soul rocked and wept. Suddenly {{he glanced at}} her. The tears were running <b>over</b> <b>her</b> cheeks, <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> was working strangely.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, hush, hush!" [...] said Rose, putting <b>her</b> hand <b>over</b> <b>her</b> friend's <b>mouth.</b> [...] "Naughty one! you can bless me, if you will, {{only you}} are wayward." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{went down}} to her room, {{entering}} softly. She was lying still, with eyes shut, pale, tired. His heart leapt, fearing she was dead. Yet he knew perfectly well she was not. He saw the way her hair went loose <b>over</b> <b>her</b> temples, <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> was shut with suffering {{in a sort of}} grin. She was beautiful to him--but it was not human. He had a dread of her as she lay there. What had she to do with him? She was other than himself.|$|R
25|$|On July 16, 1984, Knorr packed all of Suesan's {{belongings}} in trash bags and, after binding Suesan's {{arms and}} legs and placing duct tape <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> ordered her sons Robert and William to put Suesan in their car. They drove her to Squaw Valley where Robert and William placed her {{on the side of the}} road on top of the bags containing her belongings. Knorr then doused Suesan and the bags in gasoline and lit the girl on fire. Suesan's still smoldering body was found the following day. An autopsy determined that she was still alive when she was lit on fire. Due to the state of the remains, a positive identification was never made and Suesan was classified as Jane Doe #4873/84.|$|E
500|$|... "Creep" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American group TLC for their second studio album CrazySexyCool (1994). It was written and produced by Dallas Austin, who tried to write the track from his [...] "female perspective" [...] while basing on member Tionne [...] "T-Boz" [...] Watkins's real story of infidelity. The lyrics portray the singers as women that cheat back at their lovers for the attention. This context {{was considered to be}} controversial as it was strongly opposed by member Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes, who even threatened to wear black tape <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> on its accompanying music video.|$|E
500|$|In his defence, Tabak {{claimed that}} the killing had not been sexually motivated, and told the court that he had killed Yeates while trying to silence her after she screamed {{when he tried to}} kiss her. He claimed that Yeates had made a [...] "flirty comment" [...] and invited him to drink with her. He said that after she screamed he held his hands <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and around her neck to silence her. He denied {{suggestions}} of a struggle, claiming to have held Yeates by the neck with only minimal force, and [...] "... for about 20 seconds". He told the court that after dumping the body he was [...] "... in a state of panic".|$|E
60|$|When {{the meal}} was <b>over,</b> she wiped <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> on <b>her</b> {{handkerchief}} quickly, satisfied and happy, and settled down on the pillow again, with her fingers in his close, strange, fur-like hair.|$|R
6000|$|...

[...] "To catch a woman napping is difficult, even when she's half dead; but I did it," [...] says the gatekeeper. When he asked her her name, she said immediately-- ...|$|R
60|$|The Viper shortly {{afterwards}} hauled her wind, and {{ran down}} to a consort who was keeping watch with <b>her</b> <b>over</b> the <b>mouth</b> of the Loire. The captain repaired on board the other ship, whose commander was his senior officer, and a consultation was held between them, after which the Viper was again got under sail and shaped her course for Portsmouth.|$|R
500|$|As {{the video}} opens, Rihanna is dragged into a press conference, {{where she is}} covered {{with plastic wrap and}} taped to a wall. Microphones and gagged reporters {{surround}} her. In an outdoor scene, she wears a cream-colored latex dress and leads a gagged Perez Hilton around by a dog leash. Rihanna is then shown seated and surrounded by CCTV surveillance cameras; her chair begins to rotate, and she stands and begins to whip reporters, who are taped to the wall of the room. She then rolls on the floor, her hands and feet bound with rope. As the bridge of the song approaches, Rihanna wears a white latex bikini and rabbit ears, while images of headlines are projected against her body and the wall behind her. After the chorus, she appears in a newsroom. Reporters take photographs of her while she sprawls across a desk wearing a pink latex dress. Scenes of Rihanna and others in bondage gear are interspersed with images of the singer wearing a feather boa and a tube top with [...] "censored" [...] printed across it. The video then alternates between previous scenes and images in which Rihanna eats bananas, strawberries and cream, and jewel-covered ice cream. In the final scene, she lies on a newsroom desk, with a smiley face emblem over one eye and a Rolling Stones tongue logo <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
500|$|Despite this, member Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes was the opposite. She {{threatened}} to wear black tape <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> on the song's music video {{due to her}} disagreement with its message and the choice {{for it to be}} CrazySexyCool lead single, partially because of the group's history of advocating for safe sex since their debut. [...] "I was totally, 100% against 'Creep'. I wasn't down with cheating on your man, you know, for me, it's be faithful. Trust me, I fought against that single coming out. You know, I was like 'If a girl is gonna [...] catch her man cheating,' this was my thing, 'instead of telling her to cheat back, why don't we tell her [...] just leave,'" [...] she shared. In the end, Lopes eventually capitulated, stating: [...] "If some people can creep, and in their minds, they can feel better by going out doing the same thing... Fine. I'm just not one of those people." [...] She instead added her new rap verse on remixed versions of the song, which talks about the consequences of cheating. Thomas later thought the song and the video's choreography routine were [...] "cool" [...] enough to distract people from its lyrical content and [...] "just sing along." [...] "Even the song 'Creep'—not that we creep, but if we did, [...] for a woman that would do such a thing. I say just leave his ass, but if you're not ready to just jet at the moment, then you know, I guess we told you how to [...] We were really happy and we still are really happy to be the voice for so many women in so many different situations in their lives," [...] she told Myspace in 2014. Jon Parales of The New York Times stood by the song's concept, he wrote: [...] "The women sing about infidelity, revenge, status and power plays, not as victims but as contenders; when they're cheated on, they cheat, too." [...] Carol Cooper from The Guardian also described the track as the darker side of their [...] "giddy hedonism." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 27 July 1947, a 13-year-old girl {{reported}} to police that a boy called John had assaulted her by putting his hand <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and saying: [...] "What {{would you do}} if I killed you? I have done it before." [...] This incident was not connected to Straffen until later. Six weeks later, Straffen was found to have strangled five chickens belonging to the father of a girl with whom he had quarrelled. When arrested, Straffen was also under suspicion for burglary and in interview cheerfully confessed to it and many other incidents to which he had not been connected. He was remanded in custody, and the Medical Officer of Horfield prison examined him, certifying that he was mentally retarded. On 10 October, Straffen was committed to Hortham Colony in Bristol under the Mental Deficiency Act 1913.|$|E
2500|$|McGreavy {{was arrested}} by police at 3:50 am, {{walking on a street}} near the Ralphs' home. Upon his arrest, McGreavy {{reportedly}} said, [...] "What's this all about?" [...] At first, McGreavy denied any responsibility, but, several hours later said, [...] "It was me, but, it wasn’t me," [...] after which he described in graphic detail what he had done. He told police, [...] "I put my hand <b>over</b> <b>her</b> (Samantha's) <b>mouth,</b> and it went from there. It's all in the house. On Paul, I used a wire. I was going to bury him, but I couldn't. I went outside, {{and put them on the}} fence. All I could hear is kids, kids, kids." [...] McGreavy's only explanation for the murders was that the baby would not stop crying.|$|R

5000|$|In the accident, Kabang had {{suffered}} extensive injuries to {{her nose and}} upper jaw but Bunggal refused to have the dog euthanized. [...] Kabang, heralded by the Philippine press as a hero, had difficulty eating but otherwise continued living normally and even became pregnant. [...] However, <b>over</b> time <b>her</b> open <b>mouth</b> led to an infection, {{and as long as}} it remained open she was at serious risk for further problems. [...] Kabang was given antibiotics, but repairing her face via surgery was beyond the means of the Bunggal family.|$|R
2500|$|In early February 2017, [...] "It Ain't Me" [...] was {{registered}} on the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) database. Gomez first teased {{the single}} with two Instagram stories on 3 February 2017. The first teaser showed a half-profile of the singer {{with a black}} [...] "X" [...] <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> as a 10-second snippet plays with the lyrics, [...] "I had a dream / we were back to 17 / summer nights and liberties / never growing up," [...] while the second teaser was a snippet of the song's beat. Gomez later revealed the single's cover art and release date on Instagram on 13 February 2017, and shared three teasers of the song on Snapchat the following day. [...] "It Ain't Me" [...] was released for digital download by Sony and Ultra Music on 17 February 2017 as the first single from Kygo's upcoming second studio album.

40|$|Fixed drug {{eruption}} (FDE) is {{a unique}} type of cutaneous drug reaction that typically recurs in the identical locations on re-exposure to the attributed drug. FDE {{is characterized by the}} appearance of a single or multiple sharply demarcated violaceous erythematous plaques which heal with residual hyperpigmentation. A 27 -year-old woman presented with multiple dark patches <b>over</b> <b>her</b> eyelids, <b>mouth,</b> lips, and shoulders of 1 week’s duration. These lesions followed multiple erythematous plaques over the same areas which appeared within 4 hours of the intake of an ondansetron tablet, 12 days previously. The case was diagnosed as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation following ondansetron-induced FDE. There was an identical episode 1 year earlier due to the intake of the same drug. The causality assessment pointed toward a probable/likely association as per the Naranjo algorithm and the WHO–UMC scale. There have been only a few cases of FDE due to ondansetron in the reported literature...|$|R

The prosecution alleged an intentional murder and sought the death penalty against Casey Anthony. Prosecutors stated that Anthony used chloroform to render her daughter unconscious before putting duct tape <b>over</b> <b>her</b> nose and <b>mouth</b> to suffocate <b>her,</b> and left Caylee's body in the trunk of her car for a few days before disposing of it. They characterized Anthony as a party girl who killed her daughter to free herself from parental responsibility and enjoy her personal life.|$|R
