5|$|The {{second season}} {{continues}} the Human exploration of interstellar space by {{the crew of}} Enterprise, and further mention is made of the Temporal Cold War. The early encounters and historic culture <b>of</b> <b>familiar</b> Star Trek franchise races, such as the Vulcans, Andorians, Klingons, Romulans, Tholians, Borg, and Tellarites, are also explored further. The season ends with a cliffhanger that sets up the Xindi story arc, set in the Delphic Expanse, of the third season.|$|E
5|$|Unusual weather phenomena, such as {{snow and}} mist, fascinated Monet because they altered the {{chromatic}} appearance <b>of</b> <b>familiar</b> topography. In such paintings as The Magpie, one of Monet's early masterpieces, form dissolves under {{the combination of}} a greatly restricted color range, aerial perspective, and broken brushwork. A virtuoso color performance, the painting is an essay on the variations of white perceptible in the reflection of sun on crisp new snow. Wonderfully abstract passages of flat color, such as the strong violet shades along the fence, are divorced from the spatial realities of the objects portrayed.|$|E
50|$|Since the 20th century {{a number}} of magical practitioners, {{including}} adherents of the Neopagan religion of Wicca, have begun to utilise the concept <b>of</b> <b>familiars,</b> due to their association with older forms of magic.

5|$|The {{collaboration}} between Disney and Square {{resulted in a}} mixture <b>of</b> <b>familiar</b> Disney and Square characters, {{as well as several}} new characters created and designed by Tetsuya Nomura. The primary protagonist of the game is Sora, a 14-year-old boy chosen to wield the Keyblade—a weapon which is a cross between a key and a sword—for battling darkness. The game also features two friends from his home world, Riku and Kairi. For most of the game, Sora is joined by Donald Duck and Goofy. Donald, the court wizard, and Goofy, captain of the royal guard, are sent from Disney Castle to find the Keyblade. The three join forces to search for King Mickey Mouse, Kairi, and Riku. The primary antagonist is Ansem, who seeks power and knowledge by using dark beings called the Heartless. The Heartless, hearts corrupted by darkness, serve as most of the enemies encountered in the game and {{come in a variety of}} shapes and sizes. Maleficent, from the 1959 film Sleeping Beauty, leads a group of Disney villains that seeks to use the Heartless for their own gain.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{were determined}} that the show be respectful of audience expectations for the Horrible Histories brand, maintaining its familiar visual style and content as far as possible. Early concepts for bringing it to the screen involved framing or interpretive devices, including a ghostly train carrying children into the past, or a wizard storyteller to act as their guide. Eventually Bradley with producer/director Dominic Brigstocke concluded that the material {{was strong enough to}} stand on its own, so they developed, in consultation with CBBC executives, a live-action sketch-comedy showcase. Once the writing was underway, the producers further discovered that sticking as closely as possible to the historical truth made it easier for them to find the humour within it. They then introduced a comedy style relying on parodies <b>of</b> <b>familiar</b> modern media conventions as a means of making these historical details more immediately accessible.|$|E
5|$|The show's {{producers}} and creators presented material in a narrative format {{instead of the}} more traditional magazine format, used repetition to reinforce its curriculum, and structured every episode the same way. They used research about child development and young children's viewing habits that had been conducted in the thirty years since the debut of Sesame Street in the U.S. and revolutionized the genre by inviting their viewers' involvement. Research {{was part of the}} creative and decision-making process in the production of the show and was integrated into all aspects and stages of the creative process. Blue's Clues was the first cutout animation series for preschoolers and resembles a storybook in its use of primary colors and its simple construction paper shapes <b>of</b> <b>familiar</b> objects with varied colors and textures. Its home-based setting is familiar to American children but has a look, unlike other children's TV shows. A live production of Blue's Clues, which used many of the production innovations developed by the show's creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.|$|E
5000|$|A second light novel {{entitled}} Nagi is the Familiar!? Let it ★ World Conquest (Nagi ga Tsukaima!? Yattoke Sekai Seifuku) {{was released}} on March 18, 2008.

5|$|Typical {{attachment}} development {{begins with}} unlearned infant reactions to social signals from caregivers. The ability to {{send and receive}} social communications through facial expressions, gestures and voice develops with social experience by seven to nine months. This {{makes it possible for}} an infant to interpret messages of calm or alarm from face or voice. At about eight months, infants typically begin to respond with fear to unfamiliar or startling situations, and to look to the faces <b>of</b> <b>familiar</b> caregivers for information that either justifies or soothes their fear. This developmental combination of social skills and the emergence of fear reactions results in attachment behavior such as proximity-seeking, if a familiar, sensitive, responsive, and cooperative adult is available. Further developments in attachment, such as negotiation of separation in the toddler and preschool period, depend on factors such as the caregiver's interaction style and ability to understand the child's emotional communications.|$|E
25|$|Red {{squirrels}} {{are able}} to discriminate the odours <b>of</b> <b>familiar</b> neighbours and strangers. It {{has been suggested that}} this discrimination may be used by males to avoid unnecessary chases and fights by becoming known to their neighbours.|$|E
25|$|Children {{are also}} able to detect mispronunciations such as ‘vaby’ for ‘baby’. Recognition {{has been found to}} be poorer for mispronounced than for {{correctly}} pronounced words. This suggests that infants’ representations <b>of</b> <b>familiar</b> words are phonetically very precise. This result has also been taken to suggest that infants move from a word-based to a segment-based phonological system around 18 months of age.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, Lichtenstein {{moved on}} from his much-celebrated {{imagery of the}} early 1960s, and began his Modern Paintings series, {{including}} over 60 paintings and accompanying drawings. Using his characteristic Ben-Day dots and geometric shapes and lines, he rendered incongruous, challenging images out <b>of</b> <b>familiar</b> architectural structures, patterns borrowed from Art Déco and other subtly evocative, often sequential, motifs. The Modern Sculpture series of 1967–8 made reference to motifs from Art Déco architecture.|$|E
25|$|Although not a type <b>of</b> <b>familiar</b> silica-based glass, the substance, {{like many}} thermoplastics, is often {{technically}} {{classified as a}} type of glass (in that it is a non-crystalline vitreous substance) hence its occasional historic designation as acrylic glass. Chemically, it is the synthetic polymer of methyl methacrylate. The material was developed in 1928 in several different laboratories by many chemists, such as William Chalmers, Otto Röhm and Walter Bauer, and was first brought to market in 1933 by the Rohm and Haas Company under the trademark Plexiglas.|$|E
25|$|Johns' {{breakthrough}} move, {{which was}} to inform much later work by others, was to appropriate popular iconography for painting, thus allowing a set <b>of</b> <b>familiar</b> associations to answer the need for subject. Though the abstract expressionists disdained subject matter, {{it could be argued}} that in the end, they had simply changed subjects. Johns neutralized the subject, so that something like a pure painted surface could declare itself. For twenty years after Johns painted Flag, the surface could suffice – for example, in Andy Warhol's silkscreens, or in Robert Irwin's illuminated ambient works.|$|E

25|$|During the 1860s, Patti {{possessed a}} sweet, high-lying voice of birdlike purity and {{remarkable}} flexibility which was ideal for such parts as Zerlina, Lucia and Amina; but, as Verdi noted in 1878, her lower notes gained fullness and beauty when she grew older, enabling her {{to excel in}} weightier fare. Patti, however, turned into a conservative singer in {{the final phase of}} her operatic and concert career. She knew what suited her aging voice to perfection and she stuck to it. Typically, her recital programs during the 1890s featured an array <b>of</b> <b>familiar,</b> often sentimental, not-too-demanding popular tunes of the day, which were sure to appeal to her adoring fans.|$|E
25|$|However, most major-market 21st-century {{productions}} {{have taken}} a safe route, with revivals <b>of</b> <b>familiar</b> fare, such as Fiddler on the Roof, A Chorus Line, South Pacific, Gypsy, Hair, West Side Story and Grease, or with adaptations of other proven material, such as literature (The Scarlet Pimpernel, Wicked and Fun Home), hoping that the shows would have a built-in audience as a result. This trend is especially persistent with film adaptations, including (The Producers, Spamalot, Hairspray, Legally Blonde, The Color Purple, Xanadu, Billy Elliot, Shrek, Waitress, and Groundhog Day). Some critics {{have argued that the}} reuse of film plots, especially those from Disney (such as Mary Poppins and The Little Mermaid), equate the Broadway and West End musical to a tourist attraction, rather than a creative outlet.|$|E
25|$|Emerson's Concord home {{caught fire}} on July 24, 1872. He called {{for help from}} neighbors and, giving up on putting out the flames, all {{attempted}} to save as many objects as possible. The fire was put out by Ephraim Bull Jr., the one-armed son of Ephraim Wales Bull. Donations were collected by friends to help the Emersons rebuild, including $5,000 gathered by Francis Cabot Lowell, another $10,000 collected by LeBaron Russell Briggs, and a personal donation of $1,000 from George Bancroft. Support for shelter was offered as well; though the Emersons ended up staying with family at the Old Manse, invitations came from Anne Lynch Botta, James Elliot Cabot, James Thomas Fields and Annie Adams Fields. The fire marked an end to Emerson's serious lecturing career; from then on, he would lecture only on special occasions and only in front <b>of</b> <b>familiar</b> audiences.|$|E

25|$|As Genie {{learned more}} {{language}} she gradually included more grammatical complexity in her speech during everyday interactions, {{and began to}} apply her language to more everyday situations. In late 1973 she startled linguists when she gave a monologue consisting {{of a series of}} short utterances to a small group <b>of</b> <b>familiar</b> adults, which was much longer than any of her previously recorded speech; while she only used grammar she had fully mastered she seemed to be using different words to try to express herself, which Curtiss thought was a sort of free association, making it the closest she came to attempting any language experimentation. Genie subsequently spoke at this length on a few more occasions, always in the same manner and on similar topics. She also began to use language to describe fictional events, describing some of fantasies in language as early as January 1973 and attempting on at least two occasions in 1974 and 1975 to lie.|$|E
25|$|It {{is in the}} {{introduction}} and the narrative that Lysias is seen at his best. In his greatest extant speechthat Against Eratosthenesand also in the fragmentary Olympiacus, he has pathos and fire; but these were not characteristic qualities of his work. In Cicero's judgment (De Orat. iii. 7, 28) Demosthenes was peculiarly distinguished by force (vis), Aeschines by resonance (sonitus); Hypereides by acuteness (acumen); Isocrates by sweetness (suavitas); the distinction which he assigns to Lysias is subtilitas, an Attic refinementwhich, as he elsewhere says (Brutus, 16, 64) is often joined to an admirable vigour (lacerti). Nor was it oratory alone to which Lysias rendered service; his work had an important effect on all subsequent Greek prose, by showing how perfect elegance could be joined to plainness. Here, in his artistic use <b>of</b> <b>familiar</b> idiom, he might fairly be called the Euripides of Attic prose. His style has attracted interest from modern readers, because it is employed in describing scenes from the everyday life of Athens.|$|E

Gentle as well heads to the palace with a follower of Athanasius, who found the still living Estabrook after he was left for dead after his fight with Godolphin. When they are caught by one of the Autarch's generals, Gentle's companion is killed, but Gentle is surprisingly let go when the general sees his face.|$|E

5|$|Bullet souls {{are often}} projectiles, and consume a set amount of magic points upon use. Guardian souls provide {{continuous}} effects, including transforming into mythical creatures, defensive abilities, and the summoning <b>of</b> <b>familiars.</b> The movement and attacking <b>of</b> <b>familiars</b> {{can be directly}} controlled with the stylus. Guardian souls continually drain magic points {{so long as they}} are activated. Several Guardian souls can be used in conjunction with Bullet souls to execute special attacks called Tactical Soul combos. Enchant souls offer statistical bonuses and resistance against several forms of attack. They are passive, and require no magic points to remain active. Ability souls give the player new abilities and are required to move into certain areas of the castle. They are always active, and therefore not equipped, nor do they consume magic points. Some examples include the ability to break ice blocks with the stylus, and the ability to double-jump.|$|R
