40|$|We report two {{direct and}} easy ways of {{fabricating}} stable, superhydrophobic polymeric and carbon surfaces directly by biomimicking the patterns found on natural plant leaves by micromolding and nanoimprint lithography. Two distinct classes of naturally occurring microtextures on superhydrophobic leaves were mimicked in this study, which include leaves of Elephant creeper (Argyreia Nervosa) and Nasturtium (Tropaeolum Majus). These show structural superhydrophobicity derived from high aspect ratio hairs and lower aspect ratio microtextures, respectively. Both the textures could be replicated by micromolding in different polymers, polydimethylsiloxane, polystyrene, and an organic resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) gel. Patterned RF gel surfaces yielded superhydrophobic carbon surfaces upon pyrolysis because RF gel is a polymer precursor to glassy carbon. The nanoimprint lithography {{could be used}} for a direct transfer of the lower aspect ratio leaf patterns on the surfaces of various <b>other</b> polymers like <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> and poly(methyl methacrylate) ...|$|R

40|$|Fabrication {{and thermal}} {{properties}} of self-assembled silver multilayer films on <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> substrate Deshan Cheng 1, Xiaoyan Liu 1, Jihong Wu 2 and Weidong Yu 1, 2 This article uses the layer-by-layer self-assembly method to fabricate multilayer film on <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> substrate. The hydrolization of <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> film was primarily performed with sodium hydroxide aque-ous solution {{to produce a}} carboxyl-enriched surface. The multilayer films were fabricated by the alternate adsorption of the oppositely charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and silver nanoparticles on <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> substrate. The assembly process was monitored by UV–VIS spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma. The surface topography and chemical composition of the self-assembly films was characterized by atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The images indicated that the silver nanoparticles were successfully assembled and well distributed on the substrate. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of metallic silver on the <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> substrate. The thermal properties of the multilayer films were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis and dynamic mechanical analyser. The results revealed that the storage modulus of ten-bilayer films decreases with temperature increasing and the glass transition temperature of ten-bilayer films {{have been found to}} be 99. 3 C, whereas it is 94. 8 C for the original <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> film...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{behaviour}} of blends of {{a liquid}} crystalline copoly(ester amide) (Vectra B 950) with two isotropic polymers {{has been studied}} by differential scanning calorimetry. One of the isotropic polymers is an amorphous polymer – polycarbonate, {{the other is a}} semi-crystalline polymer – <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate).</b> It was found that the glass transition temperature of polycarbonate decreases with increasing Vectra concentration in the blend, suggesting a partial miscibility between the Vectra liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) and polycarbonate. The miscibility is enhanced through heat treatment at elevated temperatures presumably due to a transesterification reaction. Moreover, the presence of the amorphous poly- carbonate hinders the crystallization of the liquid crystalline polymer in the blends. It was also observed that heat treatment of the Vectra LCP and <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> blends causes a loss in crystallinity and shifts in transition temperatures of <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate),</b> indicating that exchange reactions occur between Vectra B 950 and <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate).</b> Based on these results, a new strategy, in situ compatibilization, is proposed to improve the interfacial adhesion between an LCP and an isotropic polymer...|$|R
