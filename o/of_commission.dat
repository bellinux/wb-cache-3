5|$|After {{three years}} out <b>of</b> <b>commission</b> from 1903 to 1906, Yorktown hosted Secretary of the Navy Victor H. Metcalf on board when he greeted the Great White Fleet on its arrival in San Francisco in May 1907. Over {{the next five}} years, most of Yorktowns time was spent in sealing patrols in Alaska and duty in Latin American ports. From July 1912, Yorktown was out <b>of</b> <b>commission</b> for alterations, but resumed duties off the Mexican, Nicaraguan, and Honduran coasts {{beginning}} in April 1913. Through World War I, Yorktown continued in the same role, until she departed for the East Coast of the United States in April 1918. She served an escort for one convoy headed to Halifax in August, and remained in coastal escort duties in the east until January 1919. After arrival at San Diego in February, she was decommissioned for the final time in June 1919; she was sold in 1921 to an Oakland firm and broken up that same year.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at San Diego on 15 February 1919, Yorktown {{was placed}} out <b>of</b> <b>commission</b> at Mare Island on 12 June 1919. On 17 June 1920, she was {{assigned}} the hull number PG-1. The veteran steel-hulled gunboat {{was sold to}} the Union Hide Company of Oakland, California, on 30 September 1921; she was broken up in Oakland sometime after that.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{problems}} with her powerplant kept her initial service relatively brief and inactive. Assigned to duty with North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, Dictator cruised on the Atlantic coast from 15 December 1864 until placed out <b>of</b> <b>commission</b> on 5 September 1865 at the League Island Navy Yard. She remained in ordinary there until 1869.|$|E
40|$|Commissioning {{is gaining}} {{increasing}} {{recognition as a}} cost-effective strategy for reducing commercial building energy use. Although the success and cost-effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>commissioning</b> projects depends on how well the benefits <b>of</b> <b>commissioning</b> persist over time, this aspect <b>of</b> <b>commissioning</b> is not well understood. The persistence <b>of</b> <b>commissioning</b> benefits was recently studied in a PIER project evaluating ten buildings that were commissioned at building start-up {{at least two years}} ago. The researchers examined the commissioning reports, control algorithms, EMCS point measurements, and energy use data, and conducted operator and commissioning provider interviews to investigate the persistence <b>of</b> <b>commissioning</b> benefits. In addition, they conducted site visits in a sample of the buildings. A set <b>of</b> <b>commissioning</b> measures was selected for each building to compare the persistence of benefits. Persistence was measured both qualitatively through a discussion of occupant comfort and decreased maintenance and quantitatively through estimations of energy savings. This paper reports the results of the study. The discussion includes how well the benefits <b>of</b> <b>commissioning</b> persisted over time, reasons for declining performance, and methods for improving persistence. The results provide valuable insight into how to estimate the persistence <b>of</b> <b>commissioning</b> information central to the cost benefit analyses routinely performed for commissioning measures...|$|R

5|$|The {{explosion}} put the {{dry dock}} out <b>of</b> <b>commission</b> {{for the remainder}} of the war. The St Nazaire raid had been a success, but at a costof the 622 men of the Royal Navy and Commandos who took part in the raid, only 228 men returned to England.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the power grid was taken out <b>of</b> <b>commission,</b> as circuit breakers tripped all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million people {{and the rest of}} Quebec without electricity for hours on a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|E
5|$|Another one of Heffron's {{election}} promises, namely a Royal Commission {{into the}} legalisation of off-course betting, caused considerable tension {{with his own}} cabinet. His Attorney General Reg Downing favoured its legalisation through a government-supervised Totalisator Agency Board (TAB) while his Chief Secretary Gus Kelly favoured legalising the activities of existing SP bookmakers. Downing however, went over Heffron's head and procured an ALP State Executive order requiring {{the establishment of a}} TAB. When the Final Report <b>of</b> <b>Commission</b> was handed down on 29 March 1963, echoing the position of Downing, Heffron was obliged to carry out the establishment of the TAB.|$|E
50|$|In 1970 these {{commissions}} {{formed the}} Interstate Association <b>of</b> <b>Commissions</b> on the Status of Women (IACSW) and in 1975, the IACSW became the National Association <b>of</b> <b>Commissions</b> for Women (NACW) (www.nacw.org).

50|$|The British Army system <b>of</b> sale <b>of</b> <b>commissions</b> {{came under}} great {{scrutiny}} during the war, especially {{in connection with}} the Battle of Balaclava, which saw the ill-fated Charge of the Light Brigade.

5|$|As abandoned, Utah {{cleared her}} berth. There was no further attempt to refloat her; unlike the battleships sunk at Battleship Row, {{she had no}} {{military}} value. She was formally placed out <b>of</b> <b>commission</b> on 5 September 1944, and then stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 November. Utah received one battle star for her brief service during World War II. Her rusting hulk remains in Pearl Harbor, partially above water; the men killed when Utah sank were never removed from the wreck, and as such, she is considered a war grave.|$|E
5|$|Concord resumed her patrol {{on station}} in August 1898, but {{returned}} to the Philippines on 19 December to assist in putting down the insurrection. Her duty consisted of patrolling the coast to restrict insurgent movements and shipping; bombarding various strongholds; and aiding United States Army operations. Except for a voyage to Guam in March 1900 to deliver stores, and a brief voyage to Hong Kong for repairs, Concord remained in Philippine waters until June 1901, when she sailed by way of Alaskan waters to San Francisco, arriving 28 September 1901. She cruised with the Fleet in Mexican waters, then went out <b>of</b> <b>commission</b> on 26 February 1902 at Mare Island.|$|E

5|$|In December 1940, British Commonwealth forces began counter-{{offensive}}s against Italian {{forces in}} Egypt and Italian East Africa. The offensive in North Africa was highly successful and by early February 1941 Italy had {{lost control of}} eastern Libya and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner. The Italian Navy also suffered significant defeats, with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out <b>of</b> <b>commission</b> by a carrier attack at Taranto, and neutralising several more warships at the Battle of Cape Matapan.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1642, {{both sides}} began to arm. Charles raised an army using the medieval method <b>of</b> <b>commission</b> of array, and Parliament called for volunteers for its militia. Following futile negotiations, Charles raised the royal {{standard}} in Nottingham on 22 August 1642. At {{the start of}} the First English Civil War, Charles's forces controlled roughly the Midlands, Wales, the West Country and northern England. He set up his court at Oxford. Parliament controlled London, the south-east and East Anglia, as well as the English navy.|$|E
5|$|On 17 January 1920, Prohibition {{was instituted}} by {{law in the}} United States. Soon, the {{smuggling}} of alcoholic beverages along the coastlines of the United States became widespread and blatant. The Treasury Department eventually determined that the United States Coast Guard simply {{did not have the}} ships to constitute a successful patrol. To cope with the problem, President Calvin Coolidge in 1924 authorized the transfer from the Navy to the Coast Guard of twenty old destroyers that were in reserve and out <b>of</b> <b>commission.</b> Ericsson was activated and acquired by the Coast Guard on 7 June 1924.|$|E
