In Finland, standard baseline is located in municipality of Vihti, Nummelanharju (esker) where {{it was built in}} 1932. Winding ridge of stratified gravel and sand was chosen as a location for measurements since temperature variations cause very little displacement on soil where benchmarks are located. Measurement devices such as theodolite and mirrors are then placed on those pillars. Careful preliminary measurements such as levelling height differences of <b>observation</b> <b>pillars</b> reference points are required before actual measurements can begin.|$|R
40|$|We treat {{here the}} problem of dark matter in galaxies. Recent {{articles}} seem to imply that we are entering into the precision era of cosmology, implying {{that all of the}} basic physics of cosmology is known. However, we show here that recent <b>observations</b> question the <b>pillar</b> of the standard model: the presence of nonbaryonic "dark matter" in galaxies. Using Newton's law of gravitation, observations indicate that most of the matter in galaxies is invisible or dark. From the observed abundances of light elements, dark matter in galaxies must be primarily nonbaryonic. The standard model and its problems in explaining nonbaryonic dark matter will first be discussed. This will be followed by a discussion of a modification of Newton's law of gravitation to explain dark matter in galaxies...|$|R

Bureau of Mines placed instruments in the B-North ore body of the Cannon Mine, Wenatchee, WA, to monitor cemented backfill and rock deformation during mining. The vibrating-wire gauges proved to be reliable and versatile, and {{approximately half of the}} instruments are providing data after 2 years of use. A two-dimensional, finite-element model was used to analyze the Cannon Mine's multilevel bench cut-and-fill mining method and predict rock and backfill displacements. The model accurately predicted rock displacements, but the predicted and measured displacements in cemented backfill had a correlation coefficient near zero, indicating that the model should only be used to predict rock displacements and not backfill displacements. A finite-difference model was also used to evaluate the stability of a cemented backfill pillar. Results can be used to conservatively predict backfill stresses, but on-site <b>observation</b> of <b>pillar</b> failures coupled with in situ measurements are needed to make more accurate predictions. An ongoing evaluation of the mining system has indicated that filling the primary stopes tight to the back with cemented backfill allowed these pillars to carry overburden loads soon after the cemented backfill was placed...|$|R
40|$|Pillars with width to height {{ratios of}} less than 1. 0 are {{frequently}} created in underground hard rock mines. The strength of slender pillars can be estimated using empirically developed equations. However, the equations can provide variable results when the width-to-height ratios approach 0. 5. This paper investigates {{some of the issues}} affecting pillar strength at low width-to-height ratios in hard brittle rock. The investigation includes an evaluation of empirical pillar strength data presented in the literature and <b>observations</b> of <b>pillar</b> performance in underground limestone mines in the eastern United States, supplemented by numerical modeling in which failure processes and sensitivity of slender pillars to variations in rock mass properties are evaluated. The results showed that the strength of slender pillars is more variable than that of wider pillars. The numerical model results demonstrated the increasing role of brittle rock failure in slender pillar strength. The absence of confinement in slender pillars can result in a fully brittle failure process, while wider pillars fail in a combined brittle and shearing mode. The onset of spalling in slender pillars occurs at or near the ultimate strength, while {{this is not the case}} for wider pillars. Slender pillars are shown to be more sensitive to the presence of discontinuities than wider pillars, which can partly explain the increased variability of slender pillar strength. Two examples are presented, which illustrate failure initiation by brittle spalling and the sensitivity of slender pillars to the presence of discontinuities...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the mechanical properties and deformation behaviour of accumulative roll-bonded (ARB) Cu/Nb metallic multilayers at nanoscale layer thicknesses and temperatures up to 400 degrees Celsius. Samples with individual layer thicknesses between 7 and 63 nm were nanomechanically tested at room-temperature by micropillar compression and nanoindentation at quasi-static strain-rates. Yield strength, strain-rate sensitivities and activation volumes {{were obtained from}} the experiments. First a small scale study was performed to reveal the effects of microstructural variations and pillar taper on the obtained material parameters. The deformed micropillars were then studied under the SEM to link the experimental results to observated deformation behaviour at different thicknesses. Additionally the results obtained from nanoindentation and micropillar compression were compared. Finally, based on the experimental results and observations a deformation mechanism map was proposed for the material as a function of layer thickness. Next, the high-temperature properties of the material were investigated. Micropillar compression experiments were performed in-situ inside an SEM at temperatures of 20, 200 and 400 degrees Celsius. The influence of temperature on the mechanical properties and deformation behaviour at different layer thicknesses was studied by means of the obtained material parameters and SEM <b>observations</b> in <b>pillar</b> deformation. TEM cross-sections were fabricated and analyzed to further investigate and/or confirm some of the deformation-related suspicions. The results and observations were used to draw qualitative conclusions on the high-temperature performance of the material. Novel Aerospace MaterialsAerospace Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The pillar coral, Dendrogyra cylindrus, {{has been}} {{commonly}} described as widely distributed, but rare throughout the Caribbean. In Florida specifically, {{there have been}} few <b>observations</b> of <b>pillar</b> coral and until recently the current population status was relatively unknown, although geologic records indicate that historical abundance may have been higher. Along with various environmental and anthropogenic impacts, reproductive limitation may also be contributing to species decline and limiting recovery. Dendrogyra cylindrus is a gonochoric, broadcast spawner; synchronously releasing gametes from single-sex colonies into the water column. This characteristic reproductive mode combined with the already rare occurrence of adult colonies may be making it difficult for fertilization to occur; however, the sexual reproductive capacity of this regional population has not yet been studied. Due to its recent designation as Threatened under the US Endangered Species Act, efforts to better understand population status and reproductive behavior is needed to promote species conservation and recovery. In our study, submissions of pillar coral locations from the scientific and lay community were compiled, and 573 D. cylindrus colonies along the entire Florida Reef Tract (FRT) have been identified. For each colony demographic and condition data were recorded in a comprehensive database including size (length, width, and height), colony type (morphology), percent mortality, presence and severity of disease and bleaching. To investigate reproductive capacity, tissue samples were collected from 94 colonies within 15 sites distributed along the FRT and were prepared via histological techniques. The sex of each colony, gamete sizes, and number of gametes per unit area (cm 2) were recorded and analyzed to determine reproductive potential of individual colonies and also the sex ratio. This discussion will provide a general overview of results found in this study while presenting primary concerns for the rapid and comprehensive development of conservation and management strategies for this FRT pillar coral population...|$|R
40|$|<b>Observations</b> of <b>pillar</b> {{conditions}} in limestone mines {{showed that the}} presence of weak bands in the limestone can result in pillar damage at stresses that are lower than one would otherwise expect. The objective of this National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health study was to investigate the mechanism of failure caused by the presence of weak bands by using a series of numerical models based on realistic physical properties. The effect of the weak bands on pillar strength was also investigated by developing a series of pillar models with different width-to-height ratios and determining their strength by simulating a servo-controlled loading condition. The material properties of the bands and the limestone were varied and their effects on pillar strength were determined. Model results demonstrated failure development similar to the pillars observed in the field. The weak bands were seen to develop tensile stresses in the limestone as they extrude under increasing stress. The limestone fails in tension at a much lower stress than its expected uniaxial compressive strength. The results showed the load bearing capacity of the pillars can be reduced significantly by the presence of multiple thin weak bands. The degree of strength reduction is largely dependent on the compressive strength, the frictional resistance and the thickness of the weak bands. Single weak bands do not affect pillars as severely as multiple bands. However, the model results show that a single thick weak band, which comprises more than about 2 percent of the pillar height, can cause a significant reduction in pillar strength. The weakening effect of the bands become less severe as the pillar width-to-height ratio is increased. Field observation of spalling and failure associated with weak bands in limestone pillars show that the failure mechanism in the models resembles the observed failure. The model results provide insight into the important factors affecting pillar strength in the presence of weak banded materials...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the difficulties associated with determining the strength of hard-rock pillars. Although a number of pillar design tools are available, pillar collapses still occur. Recent examples of large-scale pillar collapses in South Africa suggest that these were caused by weak partings that traversed the pillars. Currently two different methods are used to determine the strength of pillars, namely, empirical equations derived from back analyses of failed and stable cases, and numerical modelling tools using appropriate failure criteria. The paper illustrates that both techniques have their limitations and additional work is required to obtain a better understanding of pillar strength. Empirical methods based on <b>observations</b> of <b>pillar</b> behaviour in a given geotechnical setting are popular and easy to use, but care should be exercised that the results are not inappropriately extrapolated beyond the environment in which they are established. An example is the Hedley and Grant formula (derived for the Canadian uranium mines), which has been used for many years in the South African platinum and chrome mines (albeit with some adaptation of the K-value). Very few collapses have been reported in South Africa for layouts designed using this formula, suggesting that in some cases it might yield estimates of pillar strength that are too conservative. As an alternative, some engineers strongly advocate the use of numerical techniques to determine pillar strength. A close examination unfortunately reveals that these techniques also rely on many assumptions. An area where numerical modelling is invaluable, however, is in determining pillar stresses accurately and for studying specific pillar failure mechanisms, such as the influence of weak partings on pillar strength. In conclusion, it appears that neither empirical techniques nor numerical modelling can be used solely to provide a solid basis for conducting pillar design. It is therefore recommended that both these techniques should be utilized to obtain the best possible insight into a given design problem. Owing to the uncertainties regarding pillar strength and loading stiffness, monitoring in trial mining sections and in established mining areas is also an essential tool to test the stability of pillar layouts in particular geotechnical areas.

40|$|Mechanical {{deformation}} of nanopillars displays {{features that are}} distinctly different from the bulk behavior of single crystals: Yield strength increases with decreasing size and plas- tic deformation comes together with strain bursts or/and stress drops (depending on load- ing conditions) with a very strong sensitivity of the stochasticity character on material preparation and conditions. The character of the phenomenon is standing as a paradox: While these bursts resemble the universal, widely independent of material conditions, noise heard in bulk crystals using acoustic emission techniques, they emerge primarily with decreasing size and increasing strength in nanopillars. In this paper, we present a re- alistic but minimal discrete dislocation plasticity model for the elasto-plastic {{deformation of}} nanopillars {{that is consistent with}} the main experimental <b>observations</b> of nano <b>pillar</b> compression experiments and provides a clear insight to this paradox. With increasing sample size, the model naturally transitions between the typical progressive behavior of nanopillars to a behavior that resembles evidence for bulk mesoscale plasticity. The com- bination of consistent strengthening, large flow stress fluctuations and critical avalanches is only observed in the depinning regime where obstacles are much stronger than disloca- tion sources; in contrast, when dislocation source strength becomes comparable to obsta- cle barriers, then yield strength size effects are absent but plasticity avalanche dynamics is strongly universal, across sample width and aspect-ratio scales. Finally, we elucidate the mechanism that leads to the connection between depinning and size effects in our model dislocation dynamics. In this way, our model builds a way towards unifying statistical as- pects of mechanical deformation across scales...|$|R

We present synthetic observations of star-forming interstellar medium structures obtained by hydrodynamic calculations of a turbulent box under the influence of an ionizing radiation field. The morphological appearance of the pillar-like structures in optical emission lines is found to be very similar to observations of nearby star-forming regions. We calculate line profiles as a function of position along the pillars for collisionally excited [O III] ?? 5007, [N II] ?? 6584 and [S II] ?? 6717, which show typical full width at half-maximum of 2 ??? 4 km s??? 1. Spatially resolved emission-line diagnostic diagrams are also presented which show values in general agreement with observations of similar regions. The diagrams, however, also highlight significant spatial variations in the line ratios, including values that would be classically interpreted as shocked regions based on 1 D photoionization calculations. These values tend to be instead the result of lines of sight intersecting which intersect for large portions of their lengths the ionized-toneutral transition regions in the gas. We caution therefore against a straightforward application of classical diagnostic diagrams and 1 D photoionization calculations to spatially resolved observations of complex 3 D star-forming regions...|$|R
40|$|Assessment of pillar {{stability}} {{is one of}} the most crucial steps in mine design (Sjöberg, 1992). South African platinum mines has reached a point where layouts made for shallow operations are insufficient due to increased depth, creating a necessity for new design layouts for medium depth mines (> 1000 m). In this thesis, a design criterion for medium depth platinum mines’ regional support pillars is presented. Frank 2 Shaft was chosen because it is the deepest and most seismically active mine in the region. The design methodology is refining the actual mine plan with the designed regional support pillars. Average pillar stress was designed to be 1000 MPa during shallow operations. Increased levels of seismicity and signs of failure in regional support pillars showed the necessity for reducing the stress levels on these pillars. It was assumed to reduce the 1000 MPa value by half, i. e. 500 MPa, as an empirical approach based on experience. Future regional support pillars will therefore be designed according to this criterion: however it was not supported by the theory. This thesis project aims to support this design with theory, or refine it if the theory proposes a different design criterion. The primary source of information for the refining process was literature review and <b>observations</b> of failed <b>pillars.</b> It was unfortunate that none of the newly designed regional pillars were cut by the time this study was conducted. However, old design regional pillars were observed for back analysis. Crush pillars as well as potholes were also visited. As a starting point, the current design of 108 regional support pillars at Frank 2 shaft was taken into consideration. Average pillar stress (APS) levels calculated for different dimensions of pillars using Tributary Area Method and Coates Method. Numerical modeling was done using Besol/MS, a linear elastic modeling program. However, only 30 of these pillars were modeled due to the limitations of the program. These results were used for comparison with foundation strength, which appeared to be a more limiting parameter than pillar strength itself. As a result of comparisons of these results combined with back analysis of old type regional support pillars with estimated APS levels: a design criterion has been developed. The design criterion is: Design APS ≤ 2. 0 x UCS of the weakest foundation strata As stated, new design regional support pillars have not yet been cut, this result and hence the criterion has not been verified completely. Nevertheless, literature review and observations along with numerical modeling justified the design criterion as an applicable one for the time being. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{interest}} has been expressed {{the last decades}} regarding the Late Cenozoic, gas-bearing sediments of Southern North Sea Basin. Comprising the shallow subsurface of the Dutch offshore sector, these sediments have been deposited by Eridanos fluvio-deltaic system, draining the Fennoscandian and Baltic shield through the present Baltic Sea. Three successful producing fields - A 12 -FA (2007), F 02 a-B-Pliocene (2009) and B 13 -FA (2011) - and five under development have triggered the conduction of several studies in the offshore area. However the deltaic environment has been characterized as highly complex owing to its influence by the onset of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation and thus the processes that governed the system have not become entirely understood. Enhanced cooling followed by the waxing and waning of the glaciers during warmer periods had an immediate impact on sediment supply, accommodation space and mineralogical input. Although the sediments have been studied in terms of chrono-biostratigraphy, no systematic investigation {{with respect to the}} three main aforementioned factors as well as the regional sequence stratigraphy and its link to the reservoir deposits has been made up to date. Therefore, this study employed sequence stratigraphy as a method to examine Eridanos conditions of deposition, investigate the interplay between accommodation space and sediment supply and explore the nature of the gas-bearing reservoir sediments. The adopted methodology is comprised of two basic <b>pillars,</b> <b>observation</b> and interpretation. The first records as clearly as possible the observations arise from the sequence analysis while the second extracts the meaningful information and interprets it in terms of temporal and spatial concepts. Using 2 D seismic and well log data the basic observations were the stratal terminations, stacking patterns, seismic facies and the shoreline trajectory. Seismic and well log interpretation showed that the delta experienced multiple events of sea level fall which forced the shoreline to regress basinward and caused sediment erosion or non-deposition. These events are bounded by nine time-significant surfaces of subaerial unconformities which constitute the depositional sequences. Normal regression comprised the dominant depositional trend, combined with aggrading-prograding patterns, leading to characteristic alternations of highstand and lowstand system tracts. Three main depositional environments which correspond to open marine turbidites (submarine lobes), delta front and delta top were identified from well logs, core descriptions and the seismic facies analysis. The study suggests that the shallow gas is located in the alternations of silty-sandstones and claystones of the delta plain which comprise the vertical stacking of parasequence topsets within the highstand- lowstand system tracts. Reconstruction of the relative sea level changes and sedimentation rates was made based on a technique introduced by this study. It uses the average thickness of each seismic unit in order to interpolate time between the three known absolute ages obtained by the literature. The graphs showed that the accommodation space was generated by a low rate of sea level rise while sedimentation rates were increasing over time. However the scarcity of time constrains in combination with the uncertainty in the estimation of seismic volumes resulted in a low resolution outcome. A comparison between {{the findings of this study}} and those of the existing literature was made. The overall depositional trends and conditions seem to be in accordance with the other surveys. Nonetheless the proposed interplay between accommodation and supply can be assigned as local since the examined area is limited compare to areas studied in literature. Limitations are traced in the quality of the 2 D seismic data hampering the observation regarding the relation between the reflectors and the surfaces. Consequently, the study offers an insight into the conditions under which the gas-bearing deltaic sediments were deposited and tries to place them in the established sequence stratigraphic framework. Also it provides information regarding the distribution of the deltaic environments and identification of the reservoir rocks within each setting. The resulting interpretation can be used for prediction of the reservoir formations since the genetically-related packages where they were identified are distributed in a predictable manner within a sedimentary basin...|$|R
