5|$|From {{its initial}} origins in Eastern Sicily, {{especially}} in Catania, the movement got its real impetus {{with the establishment}} of the Fascio of Palermo on June 29, 1892. The Leagues rapidly radiated over all Sicily. In the spring of 1893 the leaders of the movement decided to carry their propaganda to the peasants and miners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside.</b> Between March and October the number of fasci grew from 35 to 162 with more than 200,000 members.|$|E

5|$|Scott's {{influence}} is felt throughout the novel. Lengthy descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> are interrupted constantly by tangents explaining {{the history of}} Brittany and its people. The pastoral setting is integrated into the plot, particularly the guerrilla combat of the Chouans. In complementing individual with environs Balzac also shows the influence of James Fenimore Cooper, whose The Last of the Mohicans had impressed the French author. Like the Mahicans of Cooper's novel, the Chouan insurgents are skilled at using their surroundings, {{coming out of the}} woods in more ways than one.|$|E
5|$|The {{most popular}} {{subjects}} {{of this type}} include the Flight into Egypt and the plight of hermits such as Saints Jerome and Anthony. As well as connecting the style to the later Age of Discovery, the role of Antwerp as a booming centre both of world trade and cartography, and the wealthy town-dweller's view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside,</b> art historians have explored the paintings as religious metaphors for the pilgrimage of life.|$|E
5|$|The present city {{boundaries}} {{were set}} in 1974 (with slight modification in 1994), when the former county borough of Sheffield merged with Stocksbridge Urban District and two parishes from the Wortley Rural District. This area includes a significant part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> surrounding the main urban region. Roughly a third of Sheffield lies in the Peak District National Park. No other English city included parts of a national park within its boundary, until the creation in March 2010 of the South Downs National Park, part of which lies within Brighton and Hove.|$|E

5|$|The second eruptive period, the Cougar Stage, started 20,000 {{years ago}} and lasted for 2,000 years. Pyroclastic flows of hot pumice and ash along with dome growth {{occurred}} during this period. Another 5,000 years of dormancy followed, only to be upset {{by the beginning of}} the Swift Creek eruptive period, typified by pyroclastic flows, dome growth and blanketing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> with tephra. Swift Creek ended 8,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The second, smaller {{pavilion}} {{is known}} as the Tranofitaratra ("house of glass") and was constructed in 1862 under the orders of Ranavalona II. The queen would gather her ministers for counsel in this building, and the large windows on all four sides of the building provided a view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> below, enabling the queen to ascertain the security of her surroundings. The glass used in the construction was imported by an Englishman named Parrett in 1862.|$|E
5|$|During a {{confrontation}} between rebels and British forces {{at the village}} of an-Nazla ash-Sharqiya in early December 1937, al-Hajj Muhammad was wounded, but managed to evade capture when the mukhtar (village headman) escorted him to safety in a nearby cave. Four of al-Hajj Muhammad's men died in the battle. After the British withdrew from the area, al-Hajj Muhammad was treated by local doctors until January 1938 when he received more advanced care in Damascus. He returned to Palestine later that month. By early 1938, the rebels consolidated control over much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> and the rural roads. These areas became increasingly dangerous for British forces, who were mostly concentrated in the main towns.|$|E

5|$|In this {{relatively}} liberal environment Jan accompanied the servants in their work, {{listening to their}} stories, learning the ways <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside,</b> and trying to help as best he could. As his knowledge and confidence increased Jan began {{to go out into}} the countryside by himself, exploring the hills and valleys which surrounded him. Later, as an older boy, his chief responsibility was as a herd — first of the pigs and poultry in the farmyard, and later of the cattle out on the veld. The same laws of custom which had preordained Jan's role as a farmer also had their beneficial aspect; Boer farmers customarily allotted their sons a share of the natural increase of the beasts under their care. As time passed Jan gradually built up a respectable holding of livestock.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} what {{happened}} to the island's Christians after the Muslim conquest; the traditional view is that most were either converted or expelled. There is evidence from Muslim sources, however, for the continued survival of Christians on Crete, as a subject class, as in other Muslim conquests, although according to the same sources the Muslims, whether descendants of the Andalusians, more recent migrants, or converts (or any combination of these) formed the majority. There is also evidence of rival classes on the island as when Theodosius the Deacon reports that the rural Cretans, not rulers of the land but inhabitants of crags and caves, descended from the mountains under their leader Karamountes during the siege of Chandax by Nikephoros Phokas to assist the besieged. It seems that the Byzantine Christian population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> was left relatively alone, while the Muslim element (including native converts) predominated in the cities.|$|E

In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in <b>the</b> UK's <b>countryside</b> over time. In addition to soil data, habitat areas, vegetation species data, linear habitat data, and freshwater habitat data are also gathered by Countryside Survey...|$|R

5|$|Jagielski {{signed up}} to the Polish Workers' Party (PPR) in 1944, or in 1946 (sources vary).

From 1946 to 1949, Jagielski served on the Central Board of the Związek Samopomocy Chłopskiej (Association of Peasant Self-Help), a communist organization designed to take control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside.</b> From 1950 to 1952 he was on the Central Board of the State Agricultural Farms and from December 1952 to December 1953 he was a deputy director of that institution. In December 1953, he became the Director of the Agricultural Department of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers Party, a position he would hold until December 1956.|$|E
5|$|John Jackson, Patrick Martin and Harriet Hughes, {{all members}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Countryside</b> Alliance, sought {{judicial}} review {{of the use of}} the Parliament Acts to pass the Hunting Act. They claimed that the 1949 Act had not been lawfully passed either because the 1911 Act could not be used to amend itself or because it provided a method of making delegated or subordinate legislation which could not alter the process of legislating. Consequently, they claimed, the 1949 Act had not reduced the delay specified in the 1911 Act and the Hunting Act, which was passed only in accordance with the requirements as amended by the 1949 Act, was invalid.|$|E
5|$|Mel {{tries to}} return to Tlanth, with Debegri, Shevraeth and (ostensibly) his cousin the Duke of Savona in pursuit. Along the way people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> assist her, but Debegri {{eventually}} captures Mel, furious about the months of trouble she caused. Taken to Debegri's nearby fortress, Shevraeth unexpectedly frees her and takes her to Renselaeus where she finds Bran. Shevraeth and his father reveal {{that they had been}} secretly fighting Galdran for years, wish to form an alliance with the Astiars, and plan for Shevraeth to take the throne. However, Mel refuses their help still deeply distrustful of Shevraeth and thinking of the promise made by Bran herself to their father: to become Remalna's rulers. Mel also thinks of Shevraeth as insincere, having been taught by her father to distrust of anyone who resides at court.|$|E
