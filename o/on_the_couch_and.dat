25|$|On July 27, 2004, American cable {{television}} network TV Land unveiled a life-sized statue of Newhart on the Magnificent Mile {{in his native}} Chicago, depicting Dr. Robert Hartley from The Bob Newhart Show. The statue depicts Dr. Hartley sitting in his therapy practice chair with a pencil held between his hands, and a patients' sofa next to him. After an initial temporary installation in front of 430 North Michigan Avenue, the building used for exterior establishing shots of Hartley's office, the bronze set is now permanently located in the sculpture park in front of Chicago's Navy Pier entertainment complex. Visitors routinely sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>and</b> pose for photographs as Bob's patients.|$|E
25|$|Several weeks later, {{once again}} in the nursery (as in Act I), the family's {{belongings}} are being packed away as the family prepares to leave the estate forever. Trofimov enters in search of his galoshes, and he and Lopakhin exchange opposing world views. Anya enters and reprimands Lopakhin for ordering his workers to begin chopping down the cherry orchard even while the family is still in the house. Lopakhin apologizes and rushes out to stop them for the time being, in the hopes that he will be somehow reconciled with the leaving family. Charlotta enters, lost and in a daze, and insists that the family find her a new position. Ranevskaya tearfully bids her old life goodbye and leaves as the house is shut up forever. In the darkness, Firs wanders into the room and discovers that they have left without him and boarded him inside the abandoned house to die. He lies down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>and</b> resigns himself to this fate (apparently dying on the spot). Offstage we hear the axes as they cut down the cherry orchard.|$|E

25|$|Coleman and Brown bicycled into Norwood on July 13 {{at about}} 9:30a.m. Less {{than three hours}} later, they drove away in a car {{belonging}} to Harry Walters, who was unconscious, and his wife, Marlene, 43, who had been raped and beaten to death. Harry Walters survived and later testified that Coleman and Brown inquired about a camper he had offered for sale. While Walters sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>and</b> discussed the trailer title with Coleman, Coleman picked up a wooden candlestick and, after admiring it, hit Walters {{on the back of}} the head with it. The impact of the blow broke the candlestick and drove a chunk of bone against Mr. Walters' brain, and he remembered little else of the incident beyond that point. Sheri Walters, Harry and Marlene's daughter, returned home from work at about 3:45p.m., where she found her mother dead at the bottom of the basement steps, and her father still alive. Both had ligatures around their throats and electrical cords tied around their bare feet, her father's hands were handcuffed behind his back, while her mother's hands were bound behind her back and her head was covered with a bloody sheet. The coroner indicated Marlene Walters had been bludgeoned on the head approximately 20 to 25 times, with twelve lacerations, some of which were made with a pair of locking pliers, covered her face and scalp. The back of her skull was crushed to pieces, and parts of her skull and brain were missing. The living room hallway and basement were splattered with blood, and shards of a broken soda bottle, bearing Coleman's fingerprints, were found in the living room. Strands of Marlene Walters' hair were found on a bloodstained magazine rack located in the living room, and bloody footprints made by two different kinds of shoes were found in the basement. The Walters' car, a red Plymouth Reliant, was missing, as well as money, jewelry, and shoes which had been stolen. Two bicycles, clothes and shoes not belonging to the Walters had been left behind.|$|E

500|$|Will & Grace creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan based {{the show}} on their own lives. Mutchnick, who is openly gay, based the {{relationship}} between Will and Grace on his real-life relationship with a woman named Janet. Originally, Mutchnick and Kohan first went to the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), who told them to create a television series about a new young love story, as Mad About You was going off the air. The character of Will {{was part of a}} sitcom Mutchnick and Kohan first pitched to NBC executives in 1997. The original concept was an ensemble comedy featuring three couples, one of which was a gay man living with a straight woman. Warren Littlefield, the executive vice president of NBC at the time, was not excited about the first two couples, but wanted {{to learn more about the}} gay and straight couple, so Mutchnick and Kohan was sent to create a pilot script centering on those two characters. NBC went to sitcom director James Burrows to see what he thought of the homosexual subject matter and if an audience would be interested in the show. Burrows liked the idea and when he first read the script in November 1997, he decided that he wanted to direct it. Burrows said, [...] "I knew that the boys had captured a genre and a group of characters I have never read before." [...] The filming of the pilot began in March 1998. The actors who played Will and Grace, Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, were positive about the series and they thought it had the potential to last on television. McCormack said, [...] "When shooting was finished that night, Debra and I were sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>and</b> looking at each other and I said, ‘We’re gonna be on this set for a while.’ And we sort of clasped hands, but we didn’t want to say anything beyond that and jinx it." ...|$|E

Newcombe recalled [...] "recording Take It from the Man in the day time and then recording Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request in the nighttime. I was doing them simultaneously. I would go and stay at this one studio and then take the train out to the other one so instead of being homeless I was going between these two studios <b>and</b> crashing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couches</b> <b>and</b> doing two, 18 song records at the same time." ...|$|R

2500|$|Kilcommons {{believes}} that the dog should understand who the boss in the family is. [...] He thinks that people nowadays invest {{a lot of energy}} and effort in their pets and many times neglect to discipline them properly. [...] Undisciplined dogs can then exhibit domineering and disorderly behavior such as sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>and</b> running outside the house without being properly prompted. He provides advice to families by observing their interaction with their canine companions and then analyzing the weak points. Proper training with basic commands such as the [...] "Sit" [...] command and behavioral cues such as ignoring the dog when he transgresses and sits on the couch have been credited with turning the behavior of an unruly dog around.|$|E
2500|$|Contrary to this, Audre Lorde {{was very}} open {{to her own}} {{sexuality}} and sexual awakening. In Zami: A New Spelling of My Name, her famous [...] "biomythography" [...] (a term coined by Lorde that combines [...] "biography" [...] and [...] "mythology") she writes, [...] "Years afterward when I was grown, whenever I thought about the way I smelled that day, I would have a fantasy of my mother, her hands wiped dry from the washing, and her apron untied and laid neatly away, looking down upon me lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> <b>and</b> then slowly, thoroughly, our touching and caressing each other's most secret places." [...] According to scholar Anh Hua, Lorde turns female abjection—menstruation, female sexuality, and female incest with the mother—into powerful scenes of female relationship and connection, thus subverting patriarchal heterosexist culture.|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{immediately}} following the team selection, controversy arose regarding the two teams selected. Michigan State QB Kirk Cousins, whose team failed {{to qualify for a}} BCS game because it did not finish in the top 14 of the BCS standings, criticized the potential selection of Michigan after his team's debilitating 42-39 loss [...] to Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game, [...] "I don't see how you get punished for playing and someone else gets to sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>and</b> get what they want". Michigan State had defeated the University of Michigan 28-14 in East Lansing earlier that season. [...] Others criticized the selection of Virginia Tech, stating that both Kansas State and Boise State were more deserving of the bid and that the bowl committee had chosen a familiar team as opposed to a new one. [...] The bowl was considered the lowest-ranked match-up of two teams {{in the history of the}} BCS.|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} of Jennifer Lopez's song, [...] "Dance Again", which aired on the program, was criticized as {{inappropriate}} for younger viewers. Dan Gainor of the Culture and Media Institute wrote, [...] "Even the supposedly family-friendly TV shows like American Idol are never {{safe in the}} hands of Hollywood," [...] and went as far as saying her [...] "skanky new video shows how desperate she is to retain her fame despite her fading relevance. Such sexualized videos aren't appropriate for any children to watch, including Lopez's own twins." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein from MTV Buzzworthy also commented about the video's content not being appropriate for a family show, [...] "we thought [...] "Idol" [...] was a family show? This video is less [...] "sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>and</b> chill with dad" [...] and more [...] "call your boyfriend over immediately." [...] Ed Masley from AZ central.com said that the video {{was on the verge of}} being too [...] "steamy" [...] for the show.|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{departure}} from Guns N' Roses, according to Adler, {{he was set}} to join AC/DC and relocate to Australia. However, during the MTV Video Music Awards in September 1990, Axl Rose announced Adler's firing onstage and branded him a drug addict, which Adler said caused AC/DC's manager to withdraw their offer. Adler instead reformed Road Crew with a new line-up, consisting of former Vain members singer Davy Vain, guitarist Jamie Scott, and bassist Ashley Mitchell, along with guitarist Shawn Rorie. They recorded an album and attracted attention from a major label, but due to Adler's persistent drug problems, the group disbanded shortly thereafter. Adler then entered a prolonged, self-imposed exile from the music industry; he later recalled, [...] "I wish I could say that I {{did a lot of}} traveling or self-improvement, but all I actually did was sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>and</b> get high—while the TV watched me. It was a very, very hard time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{frequently}} recurring themes include: {{critiques of}} simony and greed in the church, that, {{with the advent}} of the monetary economy in the 12th century, rapidly became an important issue (CB 1–11, 39, 41–45); lamentations in the form of the planctus, for example about the ebb and flow of human fate (CB 14–18) or about death (CB 122–131); the hymnic celebration of the return of spring (CB 132, 135, 137, 138, 161 and others); pastourelles about the rape/seduction of shepherdesses by knights, students/clergymen (CB 79, 90, 157–158); and the description of love as military service (CB 60, 62, and 166), a topos known from Ovid's elegiac love poems. Ovid and especially his erotic elegies were reproduced, imitated and exaggerated in the Carmina Burana. Following Ovid, depictions of sexual intercourse in the manuscript are frank and sometimes aggressive. CB 76, for example, makes use of the first-person narrative to describe a ten-hour love act with the goddess of love herself, Venus.From Dum caupona verterem (On turning away from the tavern), verse 17: sternens eam lectulo / fere decem horis / mitigavi rabiem / febrici doloris.

2500|$|Sarah Maloy of Billboard {{magazine}} {{noted the}} amount of sexual content in the music video, writing that it as [...] "body glitter, random choreographed dance numbers, poles and sex—lots of sex. Oh and Pitbull's there too, hanging out on the sidelines while J.Lo gets dirty, dabbling in orgies and bondage". Entertainment Weeklys Marc Snetiker observed that although the song was [...] "relatively harmless and catchy, the video is...confusing", but thought it was worth watching. Jenna Hally, writing for MTV Buzzworthy, praised Lopez in the music video, writing [...] "holy moly, how can this woman have birthed two humans and still look this amazing?", however {{felt that it was}} inappropriate for its American Idol debut, adding [...] "we thought [...] "Idol" [...] was a family show? This video is less 'sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>and</b> chill with dad' and more 'call your boyfriend over immediately.'" [...] Access Hollywood found similarities between the scene in which Lopez [...] "can be seen grinding on the floor, surrounded by a host of hot bodies" [...] and Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue's music video for [...] "All the Lovers" [...] (2010).
