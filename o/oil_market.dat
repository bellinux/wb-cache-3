5|$|The {{formation}} of OPEC marked {{a turning point}} toward national sovereignty over natural resources, and OPEC decisions have come to play {{a prominent role in}} the global <b>oil</b> <b>market</b> and international relations. The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and OPEC's revenue and wealth, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. In the 1980s, OPEC started setting production targets for its member nations; and generally when the production targets are reduced, oil prices increase, most recently from the organization's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply.|$|E
5|$|Rockefeller {{and his son}} {{continued}} to consolidate their oil interests {{as best they could}} until New Jersey, in 1909, changed its incorporation laws to effectively allow a re-creation of the trust {{in the form of a}} single holding company. Rockefeller retained his nominal title as president until 1911 and he kept his stock. At last in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. By then the trust still had a 70% market share of the refined <b>oil</b> <b>market</b> but only 14% of the U.S. crude oil supply. The court ruled that the trust originated in illegal monopoly practices and ordered it to be broken up into 34 new companies. These included, among many others, Continental Oil, which became Conoco, now part of ConocoPhillips; Standard of Indiana, which became Amoco, now part of BP; Standard of California, which became Chevron; Standard of New Jersey, which became Esso (and later, Exxon), now part of ExxonMobil; Standard of New York, which became Mobil, now part of ExxonMobil; and Standard of Ohio, which became Sohio, now part of BP. Pennzoil and Chevron have remained separate companies.|$|E

40|$|Herrera, R (reprint author) Univ Talca, Fac Ingn, Dept Modelac & Gest Ind, Camino Los Niches Km 1, Curico, Chile. Crude oil is a {{dynamically}} traded commodity {{that affects}} many economies. We propose {{a collection of}} marked self-exciting point processes with dependent arrival rates for extreme events in <b>oil</b> <b>markets</b> and related risk measures. The models treat the time among extreme events in <b>oil</b> <b>markets</b> as a stochastic process. The main advantage {{of this approach is}} its capability to capture the short, medium and long-term behavior of extremes without involving an arbitrary stochastic volatility model or a prefiltration of the data, as is common in extreme value theory applications. We make use of the proposed model in order to obtain an improved estimate for the Value at Risk in <b>oil</b> <b>markets.</b> Empirical findings suggest that the reliability and stability of Value at Risk estimates improve as a result of finer modeling approach. This is supported by an empirical application in the representative West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude <b>oil</b> <b>markets.</b> (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|The {{international}} <b>oil</b> <b>market,</b> however, did not improve, {{and while}} from 1977 to 1980, the Batillus performed {{four to five}} regular trips per year, she had {{a bit more than}} two trips in 1981 and three in 1982. From early November 1982, she was in permanent waiting for cargo at the Gulf entrance, until June 1983 when last oil shipment was embarked. From August 22, 1983 to November 8, 1985 Batillus was moored at Vestnes, Norway. On October 17, 1985, Royal Dutch Shell decided to sell the ship for scrap, for less than $8million. Her last voyage was from Vestnes to Kaohsiung (Taiwan) where she arrived on December 28, 1985 to be scrapped.|$|E
25|$|With {{the right}} {{connections}} at the Shipping Board, ships could be bought cheaply, which {{caused a lot}} of fraud. This system was too complicated for the oil companies however, so when World War II started, independents owned 39 percent of the world tanker fleet. This was especially because oil companies needed capital to invest in the growing <b>oil</b> <b>market.</b> By not buying the ships, but chartering, the bond rating of the oil companies was not affected, because the charter hire was not recognized as debt in that time. In 1934 H.T. Schierwater founded the International Tanker Owners’ Association — later International Association of Independent Tanker Owners or INTERTANKO — to protect the interests of these companies in a strongly fluctuating market.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{original}} procedure {{which allows for}} testing of Granger-causality for multiple risk levels across tail distributions, hence extending the procedure proposed by Hong et al. (2009). Asymptotic and finite sample properties of the test are considered. This new Granger-causality framework is applied {{for a set of}} regional <b>oil</b> <b>markets</b> series. It helps to tackle two main questions 1) Whether <b>oil</b> <b>markets</b> are more or less integrated during periods of extreme energetic prices movements and 2) Whether price-setter markets change during such periods. Our findings indicate that the integration level between crude <b>oil</b> <b>markets</b> tends to decrease during extreme periods and that price-setter markets also change. Such results have policy implication and stress the importance of an active energetic policy during episode of extreme movements. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|The Atlantic Richfield Company {{discovered}} oil in Alaska in 1968. In late 1968 {{and early}} 1969, Charlie Spahr {{began to work}} out the details of Sohio’s working relationship with British Petroleum (BP) in Prudhoe Bay. BP had substantial area in Prudhoe Bay, but had no American refineries, which they viewed as the most important <b>oil</b> <b>market</b> in the world. By forging a relationship with Sohio, BP was {{able to take advantage of}} the talents of an established company. Until that point, though Sohio had diversified through coal, and the creation and growth of a series of motels and restaurants on the new Interstate Highway system, it was still just a marketer and refiner. Sohio needed to produce oil, as well as refine and market oil products.|$|E
25|$|Canadian refineries, {{outside of}} the major oil {{producing}} provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, were originally built {{on the assumption that}} light and medium crude oil would continue to be cheap in the long term, and that imported oil would be cheaper than oil sands production. With new oil sands production coming on production at lower prices than international <b>oil,</b> <b>market</b> price imbalances have ruined the economics of refineries which could not process it. Most of the Canadian oil refineries which closed were in the oil deficient regions of Quebec, the Atlantic Provinces, and British Columbia where they had no access to cheaper domestic Canadian production. They also were not designed to refine the heavier grades which comprised most new Canadian production. These refinery closures were part of an international trend, since about a dozen refineries in Europe, the Caribbean and along the US east coast have shut down recent years due to sharp increases in the cost of imported oil and declining domestic demand for fuel.|$|E
25|$|In {{the northeastern}} North Atlantic the Spanish Basques used vessels of smaller tonnage {{than those that}} {{took part in the}} Terranova voyages, which {{resulted}} in a somewhat lower haul per ship, partly because of their smaller overall length and partly because of the space the tryworks occupied. The French Basques employed 250-ton frigates (r. 100–350 tons) with reinforced stem-posts and timbers in order to withstand the rigors of whaling in the West Ice - the area between eastern Greenland and Spitsbergen. They were also fitted with six to fourteen cannons, as France and Holland were often at war during this period. Many of the French Basque ships, instead of returning to Saint-Jean-de-Luz, Ciboure, or Bayonne (where they would have to transship their oil and bone), went into Le Havre or Honfleur in Normandy, where {{a large percentage of the}} whale <b>oil</b> <b>market</b> existed. Poor catches in the 1680s, and the War of the League of Augsburg (1688–97) caused a dramatic decline in French Basque whaling. By the early 18th century, only one or two vessels were left in the trade.|$|E
