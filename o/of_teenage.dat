5|$|By mid-1977 in {{downtown}} New York, punk rock was already ceding its cutting-edge status to the anarchic sound <b>of</b> <b>Teenage</b> Jesus and the Jerks and Mars, spearheads of {{what became known}} as no wave, although several original punk bands continued to perform and new ones emerged on the scene. The Cramps, whose core members were from Sacramento, California by way of Akron, had debuted at CBGB in November 1976, opening for the Dead Boys. They were soon playing regularly at Max's Kansas City. The Misfits formed in nearby New Jersey. Still developing what would become their signature B movie–inspired style, later dubbed horror punk, they made their first appearance at CBGB in April 1977.|$|E

5|$|Following a brief {{interlude}} by From Hell artist Eddie Campbell, the series' direction {{was taken}} over by Paul Jenkins in 1995. He had been former editor <b>of</b> <b>Teenage</b> Mutant Ninja Turtles and other Mirage Studios lines. He had pitched to several comic houses, having tired of editing, and eventually managed to gain stewardship of Hellblazer, the first largely untested writer to achieve this. Jenkins' run is more traditionally English in its themes, with Albion, Arthurian legend, and old English battles all featuring, and even an appearance by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and a speculative explanation of the writing of Kubla Khan, and what the interruption of the 'man from Porlock' may have been. He also returns to Jamie Delano's coverage of anarchist lifestyles, and the effects of the Criminal Justice Act of 1994, a controversial law which restricted the ability of the public to throw raves and large demonstrations.|$|E

5|$|In teenagers, pregnancies are {{at greater}} risk of poor outcomes. Comprehensive sex {{education}} and access to birth control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group. While all forms of birth control can generally be used by young people, long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates <b>of</b> <b>teenage</b> pregnancy. After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks. Some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months. In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills. In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period.|$|E

Perry subsequently mocked the controversy on Saturday Night Live, where she was a musical guest and wore an Elmo-themed shirt showing large amounts of cleavage during one skit.|$|E
5|$|Mount Saint Peter Church was {{magnificent}} {{and rose}} {{up on the}} hill, but to many, {{it seemed as if}} it could not really belong to the congregation. It was much richer than Saint Peter Church and {{if it had not been}} labored upon by so many members of the congregation, none would have felt worthy to call it their parish. But since so much work, love, and faith had been spent on this place of worship, parishioners became proud to have the honor of attending Mass there every Sunday. As a construction site, it had held some dangers. On September 28, 1941, a group <b>of</b> <b>teenage</b> boys, just out of high school, were making concrete flooring for the church at the Burrell Construction Company. A large crane operating above them made an unusual movement, causing its bucket, which weighed several tons, to come down with a huge crash right in their midst. All the working tools were completely destroyed but none of the boys were hurt. The bronze door at the front entrance fell on a worker, and everyone believed he had been crushed to death. When ten men lifted the door, they found the worker unharmed underneath it. In another case, an 18-year-old was assigned a job on the tower of the church before it was roofed. No one realized that he had poor eyesight and he fell from the tower while working. On his way down, he was able to grab onto a pulley that was suspended from the tower.|$|E
40|$|Objective: There {{is limited}} {{research}} on fathers {{in the setting}} <b>of</b> maternal <b>teenage</b> pregnancy. Most studies report data from regions of social disadvantage and low education. We report on the levels of anxiety, depression {{and quality of life}} of fathers in the setting <b>of</b> maternal <b>teenage</b> pregnancy in an area where the unemployment rate is low. Methods: Observational study of 50 fathers in the setting <b>of</b> maternal <b>teenage</b> pregnancy and 100 fathers whose partners were not teenagers (control), living within the same metropolitan healthcare region with high employment rates. Fathers were enrolled within the larger Australian Father’s Study and were recruited from antenatal clinics and community settings. Researchers administered the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale and demographic questionnaires. Results: Fathers in the setting <b>of</b> maternal <b>teenage</b> pregnancy were significantly younger than control fathers (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). After adjusting for demographic variables, fathers in the setting <b>of</b> maternal <b>teenage</b> pregnancy did not have levels of anxiety, depression or quality of life that were significantly different to control fathers. Conclusion: Fathers in the setting <b>of</b> maternal <b>teenage</b> pregnancy, when engaged in further education or employment have levels of anxiety, depression and quality of life comparable to control fathers...|$|R
