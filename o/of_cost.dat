40|$|This diploma thesis Reimbursement <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> {{in trial}} {{proceedings}} and enforcement proceedings describes the main aspects related to reimbursement <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> {{in the two}} kinds of civil procedure. Reimbursement <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> {{is seen as a}} secondary topic, but can cause serious property issues to the parties. The purpose of this thesis is to provide a comprehensive look at the issue <b>of</b> reimbursement <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> in trial and enforcement proceedings. The thesis is composed of an introduction, two main sections which are dealing with reimbursement <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> in trial proceedings and reimbursement <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> in the enforcement proceedings and conclusion. In the introduction I'm dealing with the reasons why I've chosen this topic. The actual text of the thesis is divided into two main parts - reimbursement <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> in trial proceedings and reimbursement <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> in the enforcement proceedings. The first part deals with selected kinds <b>of</b> <b>costs,</b> with an emphasis on case law, and also deals with the issues connected with the abolition of regulation No. 484 / 2000 Coll.

In 1972 Norsk Transport applied to terminate passenger transport with the railway ferry, since they were operating trips with only passengers and no cargo. The application was declined by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, but in 1978 they permitted that the Saturday afternoon and Sunday departures be terminated—these were not used to transport freight trains. By the mid eighties passenger numbers had fallen dramatically, and in 1985 the department gave in and permitted the termination of passenger services with Storegut and Ammonia.|$|E

40|$|Recently many treatises on costing {{have been}} {{published}} one after another. Generally speaking, however, they deal only with costing in general {{and it seems to}} us that businessmen engaged in costing in day-to-day operations regret that those treatises are very abstract and cannot be applied in their own enterprises. In fact various types <b>of</b> <b>costing</b> are put into practice in the industrial world today. In the strict sense there exist as many types <b>of</b> <b>costing</b> as business concerns. So it seems not only difficult but almost meaningless for us to arrive at some general principles in <b>costing</b> by means <b>of</b> investigating the actual practices <b>of</b> <b>costing</b> in a great many concerns, for any type <b>of</b> <b>costing</b> actually adopted in a business concern has its own significance and speciality and cannot always be denayed on account of deviating from the costing principles in general.
