This study provides further insight {{into the role of}} the eddy <b>ozone</b> <b>transport</b> and underlines its fundamental role in the recovery of the ozone hole during spring. The trend analysis reveals that the ozone hole intensification over the 1980 – 2001 period is not solely related to the trend in chemical losses, but more specifically to the balance between the trends in chemical losses and <b>ozone</b> <b>transport.</b> That is because, in the Southern Hemisphere from October to December, the large increase in the chemical destruction of ozone is balanced by an equally large trend in the eddy transport, associated with a small increase in the mean transport.

The model runs were carried out pairwise with identical initial conditions for both ozone fields. Five statistically independent experiments were performed with different sea surface temperatures of the years 1988 to 1992. The results support the hypothesis, that the zonally asymmetric ozone changes of the 80 s triggered a systematic alteration of the circulation over the North Atlantic - European region.

40|$|<b>Ozone</b> {{pollution}} <b>transported</b> to the Arctic is {{a significant}} concern because of the rapid, enhanced warming in high northern latitudes, which is caused, in part, by short-lived climate forcers, such as <b>ozone.</b> Long-range <b>transport</b> of pollution contributes to background and episodic ozone levels in the Arctic. However, {{the extent to which}} plumes are photochemically active during transport, particularly during the summer, is still uncertain. In this study, regional chemical transport model simulations are used to examine photochemical production of ozone in air masses originating from boreal fire and anthropogenic emissions over North America and during their transport toward the Arctic during early July 2008. Model results are evaluated using POLARCAT aircraft data collected over boreal fire source regions in Canada (ARCTAS-B) and several days downwind over Greenland (POLARCAT-France and POLARCAT-GRACE) during the study period. Model results are generally in good agreement with the observations, except for certain trace gas species over boreal fire regions, in some cases indicating that the fire emissions are too low. Anthropogenic and biomass burning pollution (BB) from North America was rapidly uplifted during transport east and north to Greenland where pollution plumes were observed in the mid- and upper-troposphere during POLARCAT. A model sensitivity study shows that CO levels are in better agreement with POLARCAT measurements (fresh and aged fire plumes) upon doubling CO emissions from fires. Analysis of model results, using &Delta;O 3 /&Delta;CO enhancement ratios, shows that pollution plumes formed <b>ozone</b> during <b>transport</b> towards the Arctic. Fresh anthropogenic plumes have average &Delta;O 3 /&Delta;CO enhancement ratios of 0. 28 increasing to 0. 99 for aged anthropogenic plumes, indicating additional ozone production during aging. Fresh fire plumes are only slightly enhanced in ozone (&Delta;O 3 /&Delta;CO= 0. 11), but form ozone downwind with &Delta;O 3 /&Delta;CO of 0. 50 for aged BB plumes. We estimate that aged anthropogenic and BB pollution together made an important contribution to ozone levels with an average contribution for latitudes > 55 &deg; N of up to 6. 5 ppbv (18 %) from anthropogenic pollution and 3 ppbv (5. 2 %) from fire pollution in the model domain in summer 2008...|$|R

40|$|Based on 20 -year {{simulations}} using {{a global}} chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem, and a trajectory model, HYSPLIT, the <b>transport</b> of <b>ozone</b> {{produced in the}} African troposphere to Asia is investigated. The study shows that the influence of African ozone on Asia varies largely in time and space. In {{the middle and upper}} troposphere, the inflow of African ozone to Asia peaks around 25 ° N, being the largest in boreal winter and early spring (>  10  ppbv) and the lowest in boreal summer (<  6  ppbv). In the lower troposphere, imported African ozone ranges 2 – 6  ppbv over Asia, being highest in boreal winter (~  4  ppbv) and lowest in boreal fall (~  2  ppbv). The seasonality of the transport mainly results from the seasonal swing of the Hadley circulation and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in Africa and subtropical westerlies along the transport pathways. These meteorological conditions combined with the seasonality of ozone precursor emissions from various sources in Africa can modulate the influence of African ozone on Asia. Ozone from the northern hemispheric Africa accounts for over 70  % of the total African ozone over Asia in most altitudes and seasons. The interhemispheric <b>transport</b> of <b>ozone</b> from the southern hemispheric Africa is observed most evidently in boreal winter over the Asian upper troposphere and in boreal summer over the Asian lower troposphere. The former is facilitated by the convective divergence in the upper troposphere over the ITCZ in Africa, while the latter is driven by the Somali jet. In boreal winter, the intensity of the ITCZ in Africa is positively correlated with the interannual variation of imported African ozone over Asia, because a stronger ITCZ can uplift more surface ozone and ozone precursors and enhance lightning NOx generation, resulting in more African <b>ozone</b> <b>transported</b> to Asia...|$|R
40|$|Tropospheric Ozone is an {{important}} source for the generation of the hydroxyl radical (OH), which is important for cleansing the atmosphere from many chemical species such as carbon monoxide and methane. Ozone, however, is also a strong oxidant causing health problems to humans and decreasing the yield rates of some plants. Further, ozone is a greenhouse gas, contributing to global warming. Two important source for tropospheric ozone exist, the downward transport from the stratosphere {{as well as the}} in situ production in the troposphere by reactions of precursors. This production is strongly non-linear and involves mainly nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds. These precursors have several anthropogenic (e. g. road traffic) and natural sources (e. g. lightning). Because of the non-linearity of the production, the contribution of the different sources to ozone can not be derived by the amount of emissions alone. Instead, complex model simulations are necessary,involving a detailed representation of the chemistry as well as additional diagnostics to calculate the contribution of the different emission sources. In our work we apply the MECO(n) model system. This system allows to nest several instances of the regional chemistry-climate model COSMO-CLM/MESSy into the global chemistry-climate model EMAC. The on-line coupling of both models allows for a highly consistent model chain with respect to the chemistry as well as the contribution diagnostics. We present results from simulations for the year 2008.

Although {{there is evidence of}} mixing with extratropical air and diabatic descent, much of the tropical intrusion returns to the subtropics. This study demonstrates that HIRDLS and the GMI model are capable of resolving thin intrusion events. The observations combined with simulation are a first step towards development of a quantitative understanding of the lower stratospheric ozone budget...|$|R
