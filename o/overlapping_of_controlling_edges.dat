By comparing the birthmarks of two programs, it is possible to infer if one program is a copy of another. In this paper, we propose a static birthmark based on the <b>control</b> flow <b>edges</b> in Java programs. <b>Control</b> flow <b>edges</b> can represent possible behaviors in program execution. Thus, a set <b>of</b> the <b>control</b> flow <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> a program can be used as a birthmark for that program. The similarity between two programs can then be calculated by finding pairs of similar behaviors <b>of</b> the <b>control</b> flow <b>edges</b> in the two birthmarks. The proposed birthmark is evaluated and compared with previous approaches in terms of credibility and resilience.

40|$|Path-sensitivity {{is often}} a crucial {{requirement}} for verifying safety properties of programs. As it is infeasible to enumerate and analyze each path individually, analyses compromise by soundly merging information about executions along multiple paths. However, this frequently results {{in a loss of}} precision. We present a program analysis technique that we call Satisfiability Modulo Path Programs (SMPP), based on a path-based decomposition of a program. It is inspired by insights that have driven the development of modern SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theory) solvers. SMPP symbolically enumerates path programs using a SAT formula over <b>control</b> <b>edges</b> in the program. Each enumerated path program is verified using an oracle, such as abstract interpretation or symbolic execution, to either find a proof of correctness or report a potential violation. If a proof is found, then SMPP extracts a sufficient set <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>edges</b> and corresponding interference edges, as a form of proof-based learning. Blocking clauses derived from these edges are added back to the SAT formula to avoid enumeration of other path programs guaranteed to be correct, thereby improving performance and scalability. We have applied SMPP in the F-Soft program verification framework, to verify properties of real-world C programs that require path-sensitive reasoning. Our results indicate that the precision from analyzing individual path programs, combined with their efficient enumeration by SMPP, can prove properties as well as indicate potential violations in the large...|$|R

These ELM suppression results are achieved at pedestal collisionalities close to those desired for next step burning plasma experiments such as ITER and provide a means of eliminating the rapid erosion of divertor components in such machines which could be caused by giant ELMs. The ELM suppression is due to an enhancement in the edge particle transport which reduces the edge pressure gradient and pedestal current density below the threshold for peeling-ballooning modes.

40|$|Carrier Ethernet has rapidly {{advanced}} {{to become an}} important technology in metro transport. However, the <b>overlapping</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> plane and data plane in contemporary Carrier Ethernet (CE) networks leads to complex and unmanageable networks. CE networks that use packet technologies {{ought to be more}} manageable, scalable and robust. Recently proposed network architecture, Omnipresent Ethernet (OE) recommends that the control and management plane in CE networks be decoupled from the forwarding and routing plane to overcome the problem mentioned earlier. In view of this, we investigate the possibility <b>of</b> a centralized <b>control</b> plane from OE perspective. A centralized control plane is a networking paradigm that abstracts and centralizes the <b>control</b> information <b>of</b> the network from the underlying distributed data-forwarding infrastructure. In this paper, we have focused on engineering and architectural issues related to the design <b>of</b> a centralized <b>control</b> plane for the networks built on OE Networking paradigm. Furthermore, the problem <b>of</b> <b>control</b> traffic overhead in managed networks is analyzed using an appropriate simulation model. A scheme to divide the network into smaller sub-networks is proposed so that the total control traffic is always below some threshold. An Integer Linear Program (ILP) for the controllers' placement in the partitioned network is presented. The ILP attempts to minimize the total control traffic, the total controllers' implementation cost and the overall response time in the network. Since the ILP solves the problem optimally for networks with a limited number of nodes, a heuristic approach is developed and presented for larger and real-time service-provider networks.

40|$|Predication <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>edges</b> has the {{potential}} advantages of improving fetch bandwidth and reducing branch mispredictions. However, heavily predicated code in out-of-order processors can lose significant performance by deferring resolution of the predicates until they are executed, whereas in nonpredicated code those control arcs would have remained as branches, and would be resolved immediately in the fetch stage when they are predicted. Although predicate prediction can address this problem, three problems arise when trying to predict aggressively predicated code that contains multi-path hyperblocks: (1) How to maintain a high bandwidth of branch prediction to keep the instruction window full without having the predicate predictions interfere and without increasing the branch mispredictions, (2) how to determine which predicates in the multi-path hyperblocks should be predicted, and (3) how to achieve high predicate prediction accuracies without centralizing all prediction information in a single location. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a speculation architecture called hierarchical control prediction (HCP). In HCP, the control flow speculation is partitioned into two levels. In parallel with the branch predictor, which identifies the coarsegrain execution path by predicting the next hyperblock entry, HPC identifies and predicts the chain of predicate instructions along the predicted path of execution within each hyperblock, using encoded static path approximations in each branch instruction and local per-predicate histories to achieve high accuracies. Using a 16 -core composable EDGE processor as the evaluation platform, this study shows that hierarchical control prediction can address these issues comprehensively, accelerating single-threaded execution by 19 % compared to no predicate prediction, and thus achieving half of the 38 % performance gain that ideal predicate prediction would attain. 1...|$|R
40|$|The speedup over a {{microprocessor}} {{that can be}} achieved by implementing some programs on an FPGA has been extensively reported. This paper presents an analysis, both quantitative and qualitative, at the architecture level of the components of this speedup. Obviously, the spatial parallelism that can be exploited on the FPGA is a big component. By itself, however, it does not account for the whole speedup. In this paper we experimentally analyze the remaining components of the speedup. We compare the performance of image processing application programs executing in hardware on a Xilinx Virtex E 2000 FPGA to that on three general-purpose processor platforms: MIPS, Pentium III and VLIW. The question we set out to answer is what is the inherent advantage of a hardware implementation over a von Neumann platform. On the one hand, the clock frequency of general-purpose processors is about 20 times that of typical FPGA implementations. On the other hand, the iteration level parallelism on the FPGA is one to two orders of magnitude that on the CPUs. In addition to these two factors, we identify the efficiency advantage of FPGAs as an important factor and show that it ranges from 6 to 47 on our test benchmarks. We also identify some of the components of this factor: the streaming of data from memory, the <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and data flow and the elimination of some instruction on the FPGA. The results provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} tradeoff between system complexity and performance when designing Configurable SoC as well as designing software for CSoC.
