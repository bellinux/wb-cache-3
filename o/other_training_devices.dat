They {{were removed from the}} UK and moved to Canada by CAE, Computing Devices Canada, General Dynamics Canada and Irving Shipbuilding. These devices were land based systems using simulators and <b>other</b> <b>training</b> <b>devices.</b> Victoria-class submarines also used a Canadian Submarine Escape Trainer, attached to a real submarine to simulate escape procedures.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Other</b> <b>training</b> <b>devices</b> {{used in this}} {{instruction}} was the manipulation trainer, which consisted of 12 towers arranged to resemble a formation of planes. The towers ranged in height from 10 to 40 feet, each equipped with 2 nose, 2 tail, 2 ring sighting, and 4 blister positions. As students in these positions faced simulated attacks from PT-13 and PT-17 aircraft, they [...] "fired" [...] camera guns at the attacking fighters.|$|E
5000|$|There are <b>other</b> <b>training</b> <b>devices</b> {{that fall}} loosely in the {{martingale}} category, {{in that they}} use straps attached to the reins or bit which limit {{the movement of the}} horse's head or add leverage to the rider's hands in order to control the horse's head. Common devices of this nature include the overcheck, the chambon, de Gogue, grazing reins, draw reins and the [...] "bitting harness" [...] or [...] "bitting rig". However, most of this equipment is used for training purposes and is not legal in any competition. In some disciplines, use of leverage devices, even in training, is controversial.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the respective contribution of four <b>training</b> <b>devices,</b> namely formal courses, mentoring, self-learning devices and job rotation in different departments, to the newcomers' socialization process. Both objective indicators of training intensity (for instance, number of days of formal courses) and newcomers' subjective appraisal of training were considered. The socialization outcomes measured {{in this study were}} (a) attitudinal variables slick as job satisfaction, organizational commitment and intent to stay, and (b) the relative fit between newcomers'perceptions of organizational culture and those reported by tenured managers of the firm (i. e., person-culture fit), The survey was conducted in four Belgian banks including a total of 201 newcomers and a representative sample of 247 tenured managers. Hierarchical regressions revealed that training intensity, whatever the device, didn't explain a significant amount of valiance in job satisfaction, in organizational commitment and intent to stay. On the <b>other</b> hand <b>training</b> <b>devices</b> had no effect per se on person-culture fit. in fact,,more than the objective intensity of training, it appears that it is primarily newcomers' subjective appraisal of training that explains socialization outcomes...|$|R
50|$|In 2010 Wales {{became the}} first country in the UK to ban {{electric}} shock collars and <b>other</b> electric animal <b>training</b> <b>devices.</b> OneKind is currently campaigning for the same ban to occur in Scotland. Shock collars are sometimes used by animal owners for behaviour training by negative reinforcement. Those opposed to their use suggest that they cause unnecessary pain and suffering to dogs, {{through the application of}} an aversive stimulus. It is also suggested that the poorly timed use of such devices by the general dog owner can cause anxiety in dogs, since unpredictable application of shock influences stress responses. Dogs can also associate the application of the stimulus with events other than that intended, suggested to potentially result in the development of aggression.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} ski as winter sport {{and the difficulties}} related to its accessibility and environmental conditions {{led to the development}} of specific <b>training</b> <b>devices</b> for practise, both for improving technique and for training after injuries.

The efficacy of <b>training</b> <b>devices</b> was investigated after comparing the EMG activation patterns of snow skiing with the <b>other</b> two <b>training</b> conditions; good correlation of activation patterns should correspond to a better simulation of the skiing movement...|$|R

40|$|A {{decision}} making methodology which applies the systems {{approach to the}} training problem is discussed. Training {{is viewed as a}} total system instead of a collection of individual devices and unrelated techniques. The core of the methodology is the use of optimization techniques such as the transportation algorithm and multiobjective goal programming with training task and <b>training</b> <b>device</b> specific data. The role of computers, especially automated data bases and computer simulation models, in the development of training programs is also discussed. The approach can provide significant training enhancement and cost savings over the more traditional, intuitive form of <b>training</b> development and <b>device</b> requirements process.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the early-phase adaptations of {{traditional}} dynamic constant external resistance (DCER) training vs. a portable upper-body <b>training</b> <b>device</b> (Fortex). The Fortex is a concentric <b>training</b> <b>device</b> based on air resistance. Contractions using this device are slow (1. 5 – 3 s) and have a limited range of motion. The exercises potentially allow maximal muscle action during each contraction. Healthy, sedentary men (n = 30) were assigned to begin either 8 weeks of weight training (W, n = 12) or 8 weeks of Fortex training (F, n = 9), and were compared with a control group (C, n = 9). Exercises were chosen for the W group that would train similar muscle groups and contain a similar volume of repetitions as the F group. However, movement patterns and force curves were not identical. Increases in the upper-arm cross-sectional area were not detected in any of the groups. Both training groups showed strength gains in the various strength tests that were distinct from each other. Our results indicate that both Fortex and DCER training proved effective in eliciting strength gains in sedentary men over an 8 - week training period. There are, however, limitations with the Fortex in terms of progression needs and training asymmetry that indicate it should be used as a complement to <b>other</b> <b>training...</b>|$|R
