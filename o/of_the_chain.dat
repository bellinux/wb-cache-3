5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain,</b> falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain.</b> Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E

5|$|In {{solid-phase}} synthesis, an oligonucleotide being assembled is covalently bound, via its 3'-terminal hydroxy group, to a {{solid support}} material and remains {{attached to it}} over the entire course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> assembly. The solid support is contained in columns whose dimensions depend {{on the scale of}} synthesis and may vary between 0.05mL and several liters. The overwhelming majority of oligonucleotides are synthesized on small scale ranging from 10nmol to 1μmol. More recently, high-throughput oligonucleotide synthesis where the solid support is contained in the wells of multi-well plates (most often, 96 or 384 wells per plate) became a method of choice for parallel synthesis of oligonucleotides on small scale. At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> assembly, the oligonucleotide is released from the solid support and is eluted from the column or the well.|$|E

5|$|The {{oldest and}} most heavily eroded part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> are the Emperor seamounts, which are 39 to 85million years in age. The Emperor and Hawaiian chains are {{separated}} by a large L-shaped bend that causes the orientations of the chains to differ by about 60°. This bend was long attributed to a relatively sudden change {{in the direction of}} plate motion, but research conducted in 2003 suggests that it was the movement of the hotspot itself that caused the bend. The issue is still currently under debate. All of the volcanoes in this part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> have long since subsided below sea level, becoming seamounts and guyots (see also the seamount and guyot stages of Hawaiian volcanism). Many of the volcanoes are named after former emperors of Japan. The seamount chain extends to the West Pacific, and terminates at the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, a subduction zone at the border of Russia.|$|E

5|$|The chain can {{be divided}} into three subsections. The first, the Hawaiian {{archipelago}} (also known as the Windward isles), consists of the islands comprising the U.S. state of Hawaii (not {{to be confused with the}} island of Hawaii). As it is the closest to the hotspot, this volcanically active region is the youngest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain,</b> with ages ranging from 400,000 years to 5.1million years. The island of Hawaii is comprised by five volcanoes, of which two (Kilauea and Mauna Loa) are still active. Lōihi Seamount continues to grow offshore, and is the only known volcano in the chain in the submarine pre-shield stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the volcanoes' magma has changed significantly according to analysis of the strontium–niobium–palladium elemental ratios. The Emperor Seamounts were active for at least 46 million years, with the oldest lava dated to the Cretaceous Period, followed by another 39 million years of activity along the Hawaiian segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain,</b> totaling 85 million years. Data demonstrate vertical variability {{in the amount of}} strontium present in both the alkalic (early stages) and tholeitic (later stages) lavas. The systematic increase slows drastically {{at the time of the}} bend.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{dewetting}} <b>of</b> {{thin films}} of end-functionalized polymers, ω- and α,ω-barium sulfonato polystyrenes, on a silicon substrate {{has been investigated}} {{as a function of}} initial film thickness, molecular weight, and functionality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chains.</b> <b>The</b> lower molecular weight monofunctional chains are found to dewet the substrate analogously to normal polystyrene but display an anomalous flow behavior at the surface. Moreover, after dewetting, the entire silicon surface still remains covered by a monolayer <b>of</b> monofunctional <b>chains.</b> <b>The</b> monolayer consists <b>of</b> a polymer brush of densely packed tethered chains, adsorbed via their ionic end groups. The dense packing and special conformations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chains</b> in <b>the</b> brush prevent interpenetration with other polymer <b>chains,</b> and <b>the</b> unadsorbed macromolecules dewet the brush. When <b>the</b> molecular weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monofunctional <b>chains</b> is increased, entanglements between the adsorbed polymer brush and <b>the</b> unadsorbed <b>chains</b> can occur and the dewetting process is retarded. Thin films <b>of</b> <b>the</b> difunctional <b>chains</b> do not dewet regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecular weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chains.</b> <b>The</b> difference between mono- and difunctional materials is attributed to ionic aggregation, which is responsible for thermoreversible cross-linking and stabilization of thicker films by interaction of aggregates with dangling ends. It is suggested to use high molecular weight end-functionalized chains as polymeric additives to retard thin polymer film dewetting. Peer reviewe...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{considered}} {{a problem in}} which one, two or three SCs simultaneously are planning to enter the virgin and price dependent market in decentralized mode and set the prices simultaneously between <b>the</b> <b>chains</b> and Stackelberg intra-the chains competition and shape their networks in cooperative competitions. These conditions are modeled by fuzzy multi-level mixed integer linear programming then converted into an integrated bi-level model in which the inner part makes operational pricing decisions in sequential games and the outer part shapes <b>the</b> network <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chains</b> cooperatively. These complicated situations are modeled in different scenarios.

5|$|Another set of officials, {{the chain}} crew, are {{responsible}} for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down.

A typical chain crew will have at least three people – two members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> crew will hold {{either of the two}} sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down, and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.|$|E
5|$|During the Swedish {{emigration}} to the United States in the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, about 1.3million Swedes left Sweden for the United States. The main pull was {{the availability of}} low cost, high quality farm land in the upper Midwest (the area from Illinois to Montana), and high paying jobs in mechanical industries and factories in Chicago, Minneapolis, Worcester and many smaller cities. Religious freedom was also a pull factor for some. Most migration was <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> form, with early settlers giving reports and recommendations (and travel money) to relatives and friends in Sweden, who followed the same route to new homes. A major push factor inside Sweden was population growth and the growing shortage of good farm lands. Additional factors in the earliest stages of emigration included crop failures, the lack of industrial jobs in urban Sweden, and for some the wish to escape the authority of an established state church. After 1870, transatlantic fares were cheap. By the 1880s, American railroads had agents in Sweden who offered package deals on one-way tickets for entire families. The railroad would ship the family, their house furnishings and farm tools, and provide a financial deal to spread out payments for the farm {{over a period of}} years.|$|E
