We will examine some recent work {{in the development of}} perceptual metrics for evaluating the visual fidelity <b>of</b> <b>animations.</b> This includes investigations into the perception of collisions and, more recently, psychophysical experiments that examined human sensitivity to dynamic anomalies, leading to the first steps to developing a metric to evaluate the visual fidelity <b>of</b> physically-based <b>animations.</b> In addition, we describe several new experiments and provide some new results regarding the role of task in the perception of anomalous collision events...|$|R

Next part explains issues of battle maps and analyses the battle at Chotusice and old basemaps. In practical part, there is established methodic procedure <b>of</b> creating <b>animation</b> <b>of</b> battle from old basemaps in ArcMap and QGIS. The results are two <b>animations</b> <b>of</b> battle at Chotusice which are used to compare options, advantage and disadvantege of both used softwares.

The availability of Bakshi's work on the Internet sparked a resurgence of interest in his career, resulting in a three-day American Cinematheque retrospective held at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood and the Aero Theater in Santa Monica, California, in April 2005. Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi, a hardcover book of Bakshi's art, was released on April 1, 2008. The foreword was written by Quentin Tarantino and the afterword by Bakshi.|$|E

50|$|Research {{evidence}} about the educational effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>animations</b> is mixed. Various investigations have compared the educational effectiveness of static and animated displays across a number of content domains. While {{there have been some}} findings that show positive effects <b>of</b> <b>animations</b> on learning, other studies have found no effects or even negative effects. In general, it can be concluded that animations are not intrinsically more effective than static graphics. Rather, the particular characteristics <b>of</b> individual <b>animations</b> and how they are used {{play a key role in}} the effects that they have on learning.|$|R

His first professional animation commission came on the Tommy Chong project Far Out Man, for which Povenmire produced two minutes <b>of</b> <b>animation.</b> By age 24, Povenmire was freelancing on several animated television series, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In 1989, he appeared in a small role as a band member in Adam Sandler's first film, Going Overboard.|$|E
5|$|The show's style <b>of</b> <b>animation</b> is {{inspired}} by the paper cut-out cartoons made by Terry Gilliam for Monty Python's Flying Circus, of which Parker and Stone have been lifelong fans. Construction paper and traditional stop motion cutout animation techniques {{were used in the}} original animated shorts and in the pilot episode. Subsequent episodes have been produced by computer animation, providing a similar look to the originals while requiring a fraction of the time to produce. Before computer artists begin animating an episode, a series of animatics drawn in Toon Boom are provided by the show's storyboard artists.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Snow White, {{which was}} a short story that the writers could expand and {{experiment}} with, Pinocchio {{was based on a}} novel with a very fixed story. Therefore, the story went through drastic changes before reaching its final incarnation. In the original novel, Pinocchio is a cold, rude, ungrateful, inhuman creature that often repels sympathy and only learns his lessons by means of brutal torture. The writers decided to modernize the character and depict him similar to Edgar Bergen's dummy Charlie McCarthy, but equally as rambunctious as the puppet in the book. The story was still being developed in the early stages <b>of</b> <b>animation.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{continuing}} {{to search for}} acting work, in 1987, Cartwright auditioned for a role {{in a series of}} animated shorts about a dysfunctional family that was to appear on The Tracey Ullman Show. Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa Simpson, the middle child; when she arrived at the audition, she found the role of Bart—Lisa's brother—to be more interesting. Matt Groening, the series' creator, allowed her to audition for Bart and offered her the role on the spot. She voiced Bart for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, and in 1989, the shorts were spun off into a half-hour show called The Simpsons. For her subsequent work as Bart, Cartwright received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992 and an Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in the Field <b>of</b> <b>Animation</b> in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Development of The Lion King {{began in}} 1988 {{during a meeting}} between Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney, and Peter Schneider while {{promoting}} Oliver & Company in Europe. Thomas Disch wrote a film treatment, and Woolverton developed the first scripts while George Scribner was signed on as director, being later joined by Allers. Production began in 1991 concurrently with Pocahontas, which wound up attracting most of Disney's top animators. Some time after the staff traveled to Hell's Gate National Park in Kenya to research on the film's setting and animals, Scribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical {{and was replaced by}} Minkoff. When Hahn joined the project, he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten. Nearly 20 minutes <b>of</b> <b>animation</b> sequences were produced at Disney-MGM Studios in Florida. Computer animation was also used in several scenes, most notably in the wildebeest stampede sequence.|$|E
5|$|Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and {{insecure}} man {{in private}} but adopted {{a warm and}} outgoing public persona. He had high standards and high expectations of those with whom he worked. Although there have been accusations that he was racist or anti-Semitic, they have been contradicted by many who knew him. His reputation changed {{in the years after}} his death, from a purveyor of homely patriotic values to a representative of American imperialism. He nevertheless remains an important figure in the history <b>of</b> <b>animation</b> and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is considered a national cultural icon. His film work continues to be shown and adapted; his studio maintains high standards in its production of popular entertainment, and the Disney amusement parks have grown in size and number to attract visitors in several countries.|$|E
