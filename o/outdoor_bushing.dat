40|$|Together, <b>outdoor</b> {{education}} and <b>bush</b> adventure therapy {{can be seen}} to constitute a population-wide health intervention strategy. Whether in educational or therapeutic settings, the intentional use of contact with nature, small groups, and adventure provides a unique approach in the promotion of health and wellbeing for the general population, and for individuals with identified health vulnerabilities. This paper explicitly emphasises human and social health, however, an integral assumption is that a healthy and sustainable environment is dependent on healthy human relationships with nature. We invite <b>outdoor</b> educators and <b>bush</b> adventure therapy practitioners to examine the proposition that healthy interactions with nature can create a unique stream of socio-ecological interventions. A spectrum of outdoor adventure programs is provided, allowing <b>outdoor</b> educators and <b>bush</b> adventure therapy practitioners to locate their work according to program context and aims, and participant aims and needs. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The acquisition, extinction, and {{subsequent}} recovery of conditioned fear can {{be influenced by}} the nature of the conditional stimulus (CS) and the context in which the CS is presented. The combined effects of these factors were examined in a differential fear-conditioning procedure with humans. Fear-relevant or fear-irrelevant CSs were followed by a shock unconditional stimulus (US) during acquisition and presented alone during extinction. The CSs were images presented upon different background contexts. Half the participants received the same context during acquisition and extinction and the remaining received different contexts. All participants received test trials in the same context as acquisition. In Experiment 1 (N= 64), a renewal of shock expectancy and skin conductance responses was found during test for fear-relevant and fear-irrelevant CSs when extinction was given in a different context. In Experiment 2 (N= 72), renewal for fear-relevant stimuli was enhanced when acquisition and test was given in an indoor office context and extinction in an <b>outdoor</b> <b>bush</b> context. The opposite context configuration produced the strongest renewal for fear-irrelevant stimuli. The return of extinguished conditioned fear can occur to fear-relevant stimuli that are commonly associated with clinical fears and its strength may be enhanced when the stimuli are encountered in certain contexts after extinction.

50|$|The {{scenario}} {{takes place}} on the planet of Thray 6, on which an alien race is threatening Rebelstar. The Raiders' objective is to kill aliens, kill the alien queen, and capture alien eggs. The Raiders have a set escape window, with their shuttle landing on turn 15 and taking off on 26. At that point, the game ends and victory points compared. The left half of the map is an <b>outdoor</b> environment, with <b>bushes,</b> trees, rivers and marshes. The alien queen herself can fire a short-ranged but deadly acidic spit.|$|R
50|$|The {{tradition}} in Germany {{to decorate the}} branches of trees and bushes with eggs for Easter is centuries old, but its origins have been lost. The egg is an ancient symbol of life all over the world. Eggs are hung on branches of <b>outdoor</b> trees and <b>bushes</b> and on cut branches inside. The custom is found mostly in Germany and Austria, but also in other German-influenced places such as Ukraine, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Moravia, and the Pennsylvania Dutch region of the United States. Egg trees are also sometimes decorated on May Day, Christmas, Whitsun, and the summer solstice. Other German Easter traditions include the dressing of public wells as Osterbrunnen, Osterhasen (Easter Hares) and Osterfeuer (Easter bonfires).|$|R
40|$|In {{a country}} where the <b>outdoor</b> {{lifestyle}} of <b>bush</b> and beach is iconic, it is a paradox that the next generation is increasingly cooped up indoors or playing in synthetic outdoor play spaces - places where there is not a tree to climb, a cicada nymph shell to discover or a mud pie to be molded. Is this what we want for our children? This publication is a response in particular, to the emergence of synthetic and generic outdoor play spaces in early childhood centres in Australia. The authors are concerned from a number of perspectives. These include young children's opportunities for exploration, discovery and learning, the physical and mental health of children and staff, human connections with nature and the promotion and practice of sustainable living. This publication brings together a group of authors with expertise in early childhood play space use and development, children's health and well-being, landscape architecture, play space standards and sustainability. We are committed to change, to shifting the paradigm about what early childhood outdoor play spaces should look like. The Outdoor Play Space – Naturally will inspire early childhood educators, managers of children's services, parent committees and others in the early childhood sector to reflect critically on what is currently happening in our early childhood centres and to actively participate in the paradigm shift towards natural outdoor play spaces...|$|R
40|$|The Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS) is a {{national}} illicit drug monitoring system intended {{to serve as a}} strategic early warning system, identifying emerging trends of local and national concern in illicit drug markets. The IDRS consists of three components: interviews with injecting drug users (IDU); interviews with key experts (KE), professionals who have regular contact with illicit drug users through their work; and analysis and examination of indicator data sources related to illicit drugs. The IDRS monitors the price, purity, availability and patterns of use of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and cannabis. The IDRS is designed to be sensitive to trends, providing data in a timely manner, rather than describing issues in detail. It {{is important to note that}} the information from the IDU survey is not representative of illicit drug use in the general population nor is the information representative of all illicit drug users, but is indicative of emerging trends that warrant further monitoring. Drug trends in this publication are cited by jurisdiction, although they primarily represent trends in the capital city of each jurisdiction, in which new drug trends are likely to emerge. Key findings from the 2004 IDRS 1. In 2004 the availability of heroin was reported to be stable in those jurisdictions in which heroin has traditionally predominated, although the prevalence and frequency of use has not returned to the levels seen in 2000. However, the price of a gram of heroin decreased in most jurisdictions to levels reported prior to the heroin shortage except in NSW, TAS, WA and QLD. Heroin was cheapest in NSW, VIC and the ACT and was most expensive in WA. 2. Methamphetamine prices remained relatively stable in 2004. All forms of methamphetamine were reported to be ‘easy’ or ‘very easy’ to obtain and availability was stable. Substantial proportions of IDU continue to use all forms of methamphetamine. In 2004, the proportion of IDU that reported recent use of powder and crystal methamphetamine remained stable and varied for base use. Substantial proportions of IDU in TAS and WA reported use of pharmaceutical stimulants. 3. The price of a gram of cocaine increased in NSW, the only state where sufficient numbers were able to comment. The proportions of IDU reporting recent cocaine use decreased in all jurisdictions except in WA and the NT. The frequency of cocaine use remained stable in all jurisdictions except in the NT where it increased. 4. Cannabis remained easy to obtain in all jurisdictions. Hydroponically grown cannabis continued to dominate the market and was considered ‘easy’ or ‘very easy’ to obtain in all jurisdictions. The use of <b>outdoor</b> cultivated cannabis (<b>bush),</b> hash and hash oil was noted in all jurisdictions. The price and availability was considered to be stable, and the potency ‘high’ for hydroponic and ‘medium’ for bush...|$|R

Drug trends in this publication are cited by jurisdiction, although they primarily represent trends in the capital city of each jurisdiction, in which new drug trends are likely to emerge. Key findings from the 2006 IDRS 1. In 2006 there appeared to be a general scaling down of the heroin market in most jurisdictions, with both the prevalence and frequency of heroin use decreasing in most states and territories. Heroin remained ‘easy’ or ‘very easy’ to obtain, but more participants stated it was ‘difficult’ to access compared to 2005. The price per cap of heroin remained mostly stable, but increases were noted in the price of a gram in VIC and the ACT, two jurisdictions with established heroin markets. Heroin purity was reported to be ‘low’ by the majority of participants, with substantially more IDU reporting the purity as ‘low’ this year as compared to 2005. 2. Substantial proportions of IDU continued to use all forms of methamphetamine. Prevalence of recent use of ice/crystal increased to varying extents in all jurisdictions. Use of speed powder tended to have remained stable or had decreased, while patterns of recent base use remained generally stable, with the exception of substantial decreases noted in TAS and WA. Although the prevalence of speed powder and ice/crystal use among the national sample was as high as heroin use, frequency of use was substantially lower at 12 days or less in the past six months. Prices for all forms of methamphetamine remained fairly stable, with some variations within and across jurisdictions. Overall, all three forms of methamphetamine were generally considered ‘easy’ or ‘very easy’ to obtain, and availability of all forms was generally reported to be stable. Of the three forms, ice/crystal was the most often reported to be of ‘high’ purity, and speed powder was commonly reported to be ‘low’ or ‘medium’. Base reports were more mixed, ranging from ‘high’ to ‘low’. In 2006 the use of the speed form of methamphetamine was just as common and just as frequent as ice/crystal use, despite IDU reporting that ice/crystal was equally as accessible as the powder form and of higher purity. Even among this relatively heavy drug using group, ice/crystal use was sporadic, on average around 10 days out of the past 180. The proportion of IDU who nominated methamphetamine as their drug of choice did not increase in 2006 and has remained stable over the past several years of monitoring, with most IDU stating heroin was their preferred drug even though they were using it less frequently. The increase in use of methamphetamine among this group, xii therefore, may be linked to the continued lack of high quality heroin rather than their preference for methamphetamine. 3. Similar to previous years (2003 - 2005), the prevalence of recent cocaine use was substantially higher in NSW than in all other jurisdictions. Subsequently, only small numbers were able to comment on the price of cocaine outside of NSW. The price of a cap of cocaine has remained stable in NSW since 2004. Cocaine was considered ‘easy’ or ‘very easy’ to obtain in NSW, and the majority reported availability as stable in the preceding six months. The frequency of cocaine use among IDU continued to increase in NSW, while remaining low and sporadic in all other jurisdictions. 4. The cannabis market continues to be distinguished by its relative stability over time, and the use of cannabis was common in all jurisdictions. Hydroponically grown cannabis continued to dominate the market, although recent use of <b>outdoor</b> cultivated (<b>bush)</b> cannabis was also common. Hydroponic and bush cannabis were considered to be ‘very easy’ or ‘easy’ to obtain and prices for both forms remained generally stable. The use of hashish (hash) and hash oil was noted in all jurisdictions, with substantial increases in their use observed in 2006 in the ACT, WA and QLD (for hashish) and WA and QLD (for hash oil) respectively. The potency of hydroponic cannabis was generally perceived as ‘high’ and bush cannabis to be ‘medium’. 5. In the context of reduced heroin availability and low heroin purity, many IDU seem to be using a broad range of drugs, including diverted pharmaceuticals such as morphine, buprenorphine, methadone, oxycodone and benzodiazepines, either instead of, or as well as heroin. In 2006 morphine remained the most commonly injected pharmaceutical, and increases in prevalence of use of illicit morphine were observed in a number of jurisdictions. In 2006, IDU also reported experiencing injection-related harms specific to these drug types...|$|R
