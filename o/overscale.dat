5000|$|In {{common with}} most {{practical}} model railways of any scale (and {{not related to}} the OO gauge inaccuracy) the following compromises are made: Curves are often sharper than the prototype, and often not transitioned, particularly when using [...] "set-track" [...] systems (radius 1 = 371 mm, 2 = 438 mm, 3 = 505 mm, 4 = 571.5 mm). Overhang from long vehicles means that track centres are <b>overscale</b> to prevent collisions on curves between stock on adjacent lines, at up to 65 mm (for set-track (reduced down to 50 mm for Peco Streamline)). <b>Overscale</b> wheel width and deep wheel flanges are used on typical models (but particularly older models), and these require <b>overscale</b> rail profile and much larger clearances on pointwork than is prototypical. Pointwork is often compressed in length to save space.|$|E

50|$|As a consequence, of {{the track}} gauges, plus <b>overscale</b> track, finescale {{standards}} have been developed. These include EM gauge (4 mm scale, 18.2 mm gauge), P4 gauge (4 mm scale, 18.83 mm gauge), 3 mm finescale (3 mm scale, 14.2 mm gauge), 2 mm finescale (2 mm scale, 9.47 mm gauge). Others have adopted H0 gauge.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{school building}} {{was designed by}} Henry deCoursey Richards and built in 1907-1908.

50|$|Finescale {{standards}} or Fine Standards are model railway standards that {{aim to be}} close to the prototype dimensions. Reduction in toylike, <b>overscale</b> flanges, pointwork, etc. In Britain it is particularly used because small British prototypes meant that track gauge is underscale. Modelling to finescale standards requires skill, so modellers usually start with the coarse standards applied to ready-to-run models suitable as toys. Standards are set by modellers' societies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Multimedia {{applications}} {{running on}} thousands of deep and wide pipelines working concurrently in GPUs have been an important target for power minimization both at the architectural and algorithmic levels. At the hardware level, energy-efficiency techniques that employ voltage <b>overscaling</b> face a barrier so-called “path walls”: reducing operating voltage beyond a certain point generates massive number of timing errors that are impractical to tolerate. We propose an architec-tural innovation, called A 2 M 2 module (approximate associative memristive memory) that exhibits few tolerable timing errors suitable for GPU applications under voltage <b>overscaling.</b> A 2 M 2 is integrated with every floating point unit (FPU), and performs partial functionality of the associated FPU by pre-storing high frequency patterns for computational reuse that avoids overhead due to re-execution. Voltage <b>overscaled</b> A 2 M 2 is designed to match an input search pattern {{with any of the}} stored patterns within a Hamming distance range of 0 – 2. This matching behavior under voltage <b>overscaling</b> leads to a controllable approximate computing for multimedia applications. Our experimental results for the AMD Southern Islands GPU show that four image processing kernels tolerate the mismatches during pattern matching resulting in a PSNR ≥ 30 dB. The A 2 M 2 module with 8 -row enables 28 % voltage <b>overscaling</b> in 45 nm technology resulting in 32 % average energy saving for the kernels, while delivering an acceptable quality of service.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} design {{methodology}} for volt-age <b>overscaling</b> (VOS) of ultra-low-power systems. This paper first proposes a probabilistic {{model of the}} timing error rate for basic arithmetic units and validates it using both simulations and silicon measurements of multipliers in 65 -nm CMOS. The model is then applied to a modified K-best decoder that employs error tolerance to reveal {{the potential of the}} framework. With simple modifications and timing error detection-only circuitry, the conventional K-best decoder improves its error tolerance in child node expansion modules by up to 30 % with less than 0. 4 -dB SNR degradation. With this error tolerance, the supply voltage can be <b>overscaled</b> by 12. 1 %, leading to 22. 5 % energy savings.

50|$|Attempts to make finer tyre and flange {{standards}} were thwarted initially by the <b>overscale</b> rail sections available commercially, it being impractical {{for an individual}} modeller to make smaller rails - although some did attempt to, by cutting down commercial rail. Smaller flange and tyre dimensions were also unsuccessful, as the narrow tyres tended to detach from the wheel centres. More critically, small flanges required comparably smaller rail, trackwork gaps and point frogs {{in order to work}} reliably.|$|E
50|$|Nancy Reagan, {{with her}} {{designer}} Ted Graber, {{brought back the}} two upholstered sofas used by Mrs. Kennedy in the room. Laura Bush, working with her family decorator Ken Blasingame, replaced these sofas with similar ones of a slightly larger scale; returned a number of bouillotte lamps to the room; and added an overmantel mirror. She also re-installed the chandelier from the Kennedy era, which Mrs. Nixon had replaced with an <b>overscale,</b> Empire chandelier, formerly in the Kennedy Blue Room.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{based on}} the Hawker Hurricane the design makes some compromises for the amateur {{construction}} and the smaller size.

5000|$|Since the 1960s, Pemberton Square {{has become}} part of the complex of <b>overscale</b> {{buildings}} known as Government Center. [...] "A few of the square's original dwellings on the east side survived until the autumn of 1969, when they, along with 2 more recent office buildings, were demolished and replaced by Center Plaza, a very long office building. The form of Center Plaza mirrores the entire crescent-shaped span of the original houses on the east side of the square, but the square itself no longer exists." ...|$|E
5000|$|Later, modellers became {{dissatisfied}} with inaccuracies and developed standards {{in which everything}} is correctly scaled. These are used by modellers but have not spread to mass-production because the inaccuracies and <b>overscale</b> properties of the commercial scales ensure reliable operation and allow for shortcuts necessary for cost control. The finescale standards include the UK's P4, and the even finer S4, which uses track dimensions scaled from the prototype. This 4 mm:1 ft modelling uses wheels 2 mm or less wide running on track with a gauge of [...] Check-rail and wing-rail clearances are similarly accurate.|$|E
50|$|Since 2mm {{scale is}} very close to the 1:148 British N scale, a hybrid {{specification}} can be modelled by rewheeling proprietary British N scale models to the 9.42 mm track gauge. This hybrid specification results in a track gauge equivalent to 4 feet 6⅞ inches (1394mm), slightly narrower than the prototype 4 feet 8½ inches. There is an advantage however in the narrower gauge as this allows more room for the outside motion of outside cylindered steam locomotives which must be <b>overscale</b> in order to function correctly. This approach is often recommended for beginners. However, 2mm-scale and hybrid-scale models do not usually sit well together due to the larger size of the latter.|$|E

50|$|The {{lodge and}} its {{matching}} outbuildings {{are examples of}} rustic architecture, also known as Western Craftsman style. The lodge's furnishings were mostly built on site in the same style as the house. The house's interior is dominated by a living room in the main block, with four small sleeping rooms directly off the main room. A hall leads to a kitchen in the main unit, then to a dining room located in the rear wing. The living room features exposed log trusses supporting the roof and a two-sided rubblestone fireplace designed by Omaha architect George. B. Prinze. The <b>overscale</b> fireplace faces {{into the living room}} and onto the porch just outside the living room.|$|E
5000|$|EM was {{originally}} defined to use 18mm as the track gauge (hence the name: Eighteen Millimetres). This was revised, and today EM gauge uses an [...] track gauge, which {{is closer to}} accurate but not fully to scale. It was developed as an early improvement on the standard OO system. It is still popular with FineScale modellers today because it utilises larger than scale flanges on the wheels of rolling stock, and because point and crossing (P&C) work is a little easier due to an <b>overscale</b> flangeway clearance. These two concessions in scaling down the prototype make for reliable running. This factor explains the continued popularity of EM as a scale for finescale modellers working today.|$|E
50|$|Whilst flextrack is {{available}} for both EM and P4 gauges (from manufacturers such as C&L Finescale, SMP and The P4 Track Company), ready-to-run (RTR) point and crossing (P&C) work is not available, so this trackwork must be constructed by the modeller. Kits for doing this are also available from the aforementioned sources amongst others. Several of these kits are also available for the OO modeller who aims for more realistic track, since most RTR track is actually scaled to HO and does not represent any British prototype and the sleeper spacing is too close together for scale. EM gauge has slightly <b>overscale</b> flanges and flangeways on point and crossing work; P4 is closer to scale but the smaller flanges and flangeways on P&C work expose poor track construction.|$|E
