Method: In this research, it was studied and developed a comprehensive strategy for multiphysics modeling and simulation of mass and momentum transfer phenomena in the process of <b>osmotic</b> <b>evaporation</b> through Comsol® and Matlab® software. It was used an axial geometry approach in two dimensions as simplifications of real module and the finite element method for the numerical solution. The simulations were validated experimentally in an <b>osmotic</b> <b>evaporation</b> system of laboratory scale. Results: The models used and the generated simulations were statistically significant (p < 0, 05) in predicting the flux behavior, taking into account the effect of flow and temperature feed together with the brine flow, being obtained correlations above 96 % between experimental and calculated data. Conclusions: It was found that for the conditions studied the Knudsen diffusion model is most suitable to describe the transfer of water vapor through the hydrophobic membrane. Simulations developed adequately describe the process of <b>osmotic</b> <b>evaporation,</b> becoming a tool for faster economic development of this technology...|$|E
40|$|<b>Osmotic</b> <b>evaporation</b> (or osmotic distillation) {{was carried}} out on roselle extract, apple and grape juices. The {{industrial}} pilot plant used had a hydrophobic, polypropylene, hollow-fiber membrane with an area of 10. 2 m 2 and an average pore diameter of 0. 2 ?m. It was suitable for concentrating vegetable extracts and fruit juices, and controlled various parameters such as temperature, flow velocity, and brine concentration. The final total soluble solids (TSS) contents achieved were 660, 570, and 610 g kg? 1 for grape juice, apple juice, and roselle extract, respectively. Temperature and concentration of solutions significantly influenced evaporation flux, which, for roselle extract, was 1. 5 kg h? 1 m? 2 at 610 g TSS kg? 1 and 45 °C. The physico-chemical, biochemical, and aromatic qualities of concentrates obtained by <b>osmotic</b> <b>evaporation</b> were much {{higher than those of}} thermal concentrates, and close to those of the initial products. Industrial relevance: Membrane processes are increasingly used to concentrate thermo-sensitive fruit juices and plant extracts. Their capacity to operate at moderate temperatures and pressures means that their energy consumption is low, while they produce good quality concentrates. Nonetheless, the main disadvantage of baromembrane processes is their inability to reach the concentration levels standard for products of thermal evaporation because of limitations resulting from high osmotic pressure. Actually, reverse osmosis membranes and equipment limit the final concentration of fruit juices to about 25 - 35 °Brix. <b>Osmotic</b> <b>evaporation</b> has attracted considerable interest, as it can concentrate juices to as much as 65 °Brix. This process, when applied to various juices, better preserves the quality of raw materials. However, because of the geometrical limitations of commercially available membranes and modules, juices must first be clarified. To our knowledge, only a few studies on <b>osmotic</b> <b>evaporation</b> have so far been conducted at a semi-industrial scale and never with roselle extracts. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Cholupa it’s {{an exotic}} fruit that has {{excellent}} organoleptic characteristics but highly sensitive to thermal treatments. Fruit was harvested in commercial fields {{and for each}} process stage, the following physicochemical parameters were analyzed: soluble solids, pH, total solids, viscosity, and turbidity. Was used a Pellicon 2 ® ultrafiltration system (10 kDa) with flat membranes and filtration area 0. 5 m 2, osmotic evaporator had a polypropylene hydrophobic hollow fiber module MD 020 CP 2 N® with area 0. 104 m 2. Prior to ultrafiltration, {{in order to obtain}} a higher permeate flow, juice was subjected to enzymatic treatment with commercial mixtures, found that doses of Maxoliva® (50 μl/ 100 g) and Rapidase® (40 μl/ 100 g) are best treatment, which had a significant effect (P< 0. 05) reducing the viscosity and increase soluble solids; in clarification process by ultrafiltration, permeate flux rate has a behavior that fulfills Darcy law, with 19. 4 and 6. 0 l m- 2 h- 1, as maximum and minimum, respectively. Finally, <b>osmotic</b> <b>evaporation</b> process produce a concentrate of 65. 15 ± 0. 36 °Brix with homogeneous appearance, dark yellow color, which when it's reconstituted dissolves easily in water. The results show that ultrafiltration and <b>osmotic</b> <b>evaporation</b> proved to be effective and synergistic technologies to get a good quality concentrate, that preserve much original characteristics of juice.

The high and middle intertidal zones of the northeastern portion ("barren") of the limestone bench on the windward side of Enewetak Island, Enewetak Atoll, Marshall Islands, have a significantly higher number of herbivorous fishes grazing at high tide than the same intertidal zones of the reef flat 300 m to the southwest ("algae-covered"). This portion of the reef flat in the barren, heavily grazed area has a significantly lower coverage by erect, macroscopic algae and a lower algal biomass than the same portion of the reef flat in the algae-covered area. The removal of part of the limestone substratum by the grazing fishes as they feed and the reduced coverage by erect, macroscopic algae result in a lower topographic relief in the barren area than found in the algaecovered area. The heavily grazed area has a significantly lower number of mobile epifaunal invertebrate species and individuals per square meter than the lightly grazed area. Differences in infauna (sipunculans, polychaete worms, and tanaid crustaceans) are not so clear. When portions of the barren area were excluded from fish grazing activity for three months, the substratum under the exclosures had 100 %coverage by an algal mat; the density of mobile invertebrate epifauna was {{an order of magnitude}} higher than in quadrats outside the exclosures. Although the high and middle intertidal community is subjected to apparently severe physical stresses (desiccation, insolation, wave shock, ultraviolet radiation, and <b>osmotic</b> stress from <b>evaporation</b> in the tide pools and rainfall), it appears to be principally structured by the grazing activities of herbivorous fishes. The high level of grazing in the barren area results in coverage by filamentous blue-green algae and a diatom-bacterial film, which may be a nutritionally more important food source to the fishes than the coralline algae in the algae-covered area...|$|R
40|$|<b>Osmotic</b> <b>evaporation</b> is a {{modification}} of traditional processes using membranes; where {{the effect of a}} vapor pressure differential, produced by a highly concentrated solution of extraction, water is transferred as vapor through a membrane that acts as a hydrophobic body. This membrane technology is presented as a great alternative for processing exotic fruits, producing concentrates {{that can be used in}} the daily diet, being more comfortable to use, reducing transportation costs and increasing the shelf life. This process has many advantages compared to traditional operations, allowing operated at atmospheric pressure and low temperature, ideal for heat-sensitive products...|$|E
40|$|<b>Osmotic</b> <b>evaporation</b> (OE) {{was applied}} to grape juice to {{increase}} the sugar content and thus {{to improve the quality}} of wine obtained after fermentation. The use of aqueous solutions of glycerol as extractant avoids corrosion and scaling, which are the main problems in OE with brines. Preliminary experiments were performed on lab scale using water or glucose solutions as feed, and NaCl or glycerol as extractant. The runs with NaCl allowed measurement of the membrane transport properties, whereas glycerol was used to quantify the concentration polarization phenomena involved. The extract side concentration polarization severely limited the flux achievable for glycerol concentration above 50 % wt, while the extract side concentration was negligible in the OE with NaCl. The feed side concentration polarization played a minor role for glucose content up to 40 % wt. Experiments with grape juice were performed on pilot scale equipped with plate and frame modules. The performance were in good agreement with lab results on glucose model solutions, the lower flux observed was due only to the low temperature of operation. The process was tested on 3 types of grape juice (white, rosé, and red). Treated and control juices were fermented, and corresponding wines were analyzed for selected parameters and evaluated by sensory analysis. The OE treatment removed water from grape juice and increased both the total soluble solids and sugar content of juice, thus ethanol content and dry extract in wine always increased. The <b>osmotic</b> <b>evaporation</b> significantly improved sensory quality of red wine that was judged as having a full body, more structure, and persistence...|$|E
40|$|<b>Osmotic</b> <b>evaporation</b> is a {{modification}} of traditional processes using membranes; {{by means of a}} vapour pressure differential, produced by a highly concentrated extraction solution, water is transferred through a hydrophobic membrane as vapour. This technique has many advantages over traditional processes, allowing work at atmospheric pressure and low temperatures, this being ideal for heatsensitive products. This paper presents and synthetically analyses the phenomena of heat and mass transfer which occurs in the process and describes the models used for estimating the parameters of interest, such as flow, temperature, heat transfer rate and the relationships that exist amongst them when hollow fibre modules are used, providing a quick reference tool and specific information about this process...|$|E
40|$|A new {{combination}} of membrane-based processes was studied {{in order to}} produce a natural flavouring concentrate from shrimp cooking juice. The process associates a pre-concentration step by nanofiltration (NF) until a Volume Reduction Ratio (VRR) of 10 and a final concentration by <b>osmotic</b> <b>evaporation</b> (OE). Thanks to NF, the juice was partially concentrated and desalinated, allowing the further OE step to be run in optimal conditions: reduction of the quantity of water to be evaporated and of the production of brine, limitation of the loss of volatile compounds and improvement of sensory acceptability. During OE step run at pilot-scale, a 52 % dry matter concentrate was obtained with aroma loss lower than 35 %. Products were characterised by sensory and chemical analyses all along the process. With sensorial characteristics matching the expectancies, the concentrate could be incorporated at 2. 5 % in food preparations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the technical feasibility of coupling two membrane separation processes, reverse osmosis (RO) and <b>osmotic</b> <b>evaporation</b> (OE), in order to concentrate clarified camu–camu juice, focusing on the vitamin C, phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of the final product. The juice was firstly pre-concentrated by RO, reaching 285 gkg− 1 of soluble solids. During this step, the juice’s osmotic pressure showed {{to be the main}} factor controlling mass transfer. The juice was then concentrated by OE, reaching 530 gkg− 1 of soluble solids. Vitamin C, total phenolics and antioxidant activity levels of 94. 6 g ascorbic acid kg− 1, 105. 2 g galic acid kg− 1 and 762 mmol Trolox kg− 1, respectively, were achieved in the final product. The use of integrated membrane processes proved to be an interesting alternative to the concentration of thermosensitive juices, reaching concentration levels up to 7 times for camu–camu juice’s bioactive compounds...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{concentration}} process {{of three different}} tea extracts (medicinal Rosil No. 6, Black, and Forest Fruit teas) using the <b>osmotic</b> <b>evaporation</b> (OE) process, was studied. The effect of the OE process {{on the content of}} phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity was evaluated. The concentration process was carried out in a hollow-fibre membrane contactor with an effective surface area of 0. 54 m 2. The tea extract was circulated through the shell side of the contactor, while a concentrated osmotic solution (CaCl 2 5 M) was circulated inside the fibres. The flux, the driving force, and the mass transfer coefficient were evaluated. A decrease of the water flux over time was observed and was attributed only to the decrease of the driving force, caused by the dilution of the osmotic solution. Using a surface area/feed volume ratio of 774 m 2 ·m− 3, it is possible to reach a tea concentration of 40 % (w/w) in 5 h, with a constant water flux and without losing the phenolic content and antioxidant potential in most teas...|$|E
