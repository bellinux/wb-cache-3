5|$|A {{number of}} controversies have since emerged {{surrounding}} the circumstances leading to Davis' death in North Korea. His presence in Korea at the time, the necessity <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>actions,</b> and {{the identity of}} his assailant have all been in dispute.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} of {{interviews}} while in prison in 2015, Bales revealed in depth his recollection <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>actions</b> step by step {{the night of the}} murders and why he believed he acted the way he did in an article published in GQ magazine on October 21, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Pericles {{marked a}} whole era and {{inspired}} conflicting judgments about his significant decisions. The {{fact that he}} was {{at the same time a}} vigorous statesman, general and orator makes more complex the objective assessment <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|E

5|$|Reaction {{from within}} the Wikipedia {{community}} to the Essjay/Jordan identity discrepancy was sharp, voluminous, and mixed. While most editors denounced at least some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>actions,</b> responses ranged from offering complete support to accusing Jordan of fraud.|$|E
5|$|A.P. Hill has {{received}} some criticism for his ineffective performance. His actions caused {{the battle to}} begin and then escalate on July 1, despite Lee's orders not to bring on a general engagement (although historians point out that Hill kept Lee well informed <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>actions</b> during the day). However, Hill's illness minimized his personal involvement {{in the remainder of}} the battle, and Lee took the explicit step of temporarily removing troops from Hill's corps and giving them to Longstreet for Pickett's Charge.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>actions</b> in Greece and Crete, Kippenberger had forged a {{reputation}} for himself {{as one of the}} leading officers of the 2nd Division. His brigade commander, Puttick, recommended him for leadership of an infantry brigade although for the time being he would remain commander of the 20th Battalion. Later in the year, he would be awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his leadership during the Battle of Crete.|$|E

5|$|Black also {{identifies}} {{a mechanism}} Fleming uses in Casino Royale—and in subsequent Bond novels—which {{is to use}} the evil of his opponents both as a justification <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>actions,</b> and as a device to foil their own plans. Black refers to the episode of the attempted assassination of Bond by Bulgarian assassins which results in their own deaths.|$|E
5|$|Black {{realizes that}} the killer is trying to {{experience}} the sexual encounters he missed out on before his marriage, and that he believes his victims are living the happiest moments of their lives because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>actions.</b> He returns to the Nesbitt home, finding the honeymooning couple locked in a bomb shelter below the house. Black runs upstairs, thinking that Nesbitt will murder his wife, but arrives {{in time to see}} him commit suicide by injection instead.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane {{had several}} {{disputes}} with San Martín. He discussed several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>actions</b> {{and tried to}} bypass his authority. During the blockade of El Callao, he proposed that O'Higgins {{take control of the}} mission and send any spoils of battle to Chile. As San Martín was appointed Protector of Peru, Cochrane reasoned that San Martín was no longer under Chilean command, and took the navy away. In later years Cochrane made accusations against San Martín in Chile.|$|E

50|$|Before he {{got back}} to the docks at Wilhelmshaven for {{refuelling}} and resupply, the United States had formally protested to Berlin against the brutality <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>action.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{actions of}} both commanders have been {{extensively}} analyzed in this action. While Montcalm performed well during the battle, some tactical options escaped his notice, and some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>actions</b> {{in preparing the}} defenses at Carillon are open to question. In contrast, almost everything Abercrombie did has been questioned. It is widely held among historians {{that he was an}} incompetent commander.|$|E
5|$|Another account {{recalled}} how Marseille once ignored {{an order to}} turn back from a fight when outnumbered by two to one, but seeing an Allied aircraft closing on his wing leader, Marseille broke formation and shot the attacking aircraft down. Expecting congratulations when he landed, his commander was critical <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>actions,</b> receiving three days of confinement for failing to carry out an order. Days later, Marseille was passed over for promotion and was now the sole Fähnrich in the Geschwader. This was a humiliation for him, suspecting that his abilities were being suppressed so the squadron leaders could take all the glory in the air.|$|E
5|$|Finding Konrad's {{executed}} command team, Walker uses a small {{radio to}} communicate with who he believes to be Konrad himself, who challenges the morality <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>actions</b> throughout the story. Konrad then manipulates Walker into executing an Emirati survivor or a 33rd soldier, who both committed serious crimes. Delta subsequently meet CIA agent Jeff Riggs, who is leading a raid on the city's last water supply. Delta aids Riggs {{with the aim of}} crippling the 33rd's operations, but Riggs destroys the supply instead, admitting he wanted to wipe out the remaining population of Dubai to cover up the atrocities of the 33rd.|$|E
25|$|Hafeez {{has been}} banned from bowling in {{international}} cricket for 12 months following an independent assessment <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>action,</b> {{which took place}} at the Sri Ramachandra University in Chennai on 6 July. The 34-year-old was assessed after the legality <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bowling <b>action</b> came under question by the match officials during Pakistan’s first Test victory over Sri Lanka in Galle (17–21 June).|$|R
25|$|As Whitman {{traveled}} toward Parris Island, <b>his</b> father learned <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>action</b> and telephoned {{a branch}} of the federal government, trying unsuccessfully to have his son's enlistment canceled.|$|R

5|$|He spreads poison {{and kills}} much {{livestock}} and many Frenchmen {{to prepare for}} an uprising, but is forced into exile as the French become aware <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>actions</b> and begin to search for him. He returns after four years, but is captured and tied to a post to be lashed and burned {{in front of a}} massive black audience. While tied to the post, he metamorphoses into an insect and flies overhead before landing in the crowds. During the ensuing pandemonium he is again captured by ten men and burned in the fire. The slaves are certain that he has been saved and remain in defiant and jubilant spirits. The memory of Macandal is not extinguished in the flames. Ti Noel tells his children the stories he was told by Macandal, and they await his return many years later.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, {{after the}} close of the {{legislative}} year, Sprigg relocated from Moorefield to Cumberland, Maryland. He resumed the practice of law and by 1894, his law office was located in the George's Creek and Cumberland Railroad headquarters building on Washington Street in Cumberland. Following the 1898 decisive victory of Winfield Scott Schley, a Frederick native, at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba during the Spanish–American War, Sprigg led an initiative in 1899 to raise funds for a silver service to be awarded from the people of Maryland to Schley in recognition <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 1971, Chotiner {{resigned}} from his White House job {{and returned to}} the private practice of law. He represented former Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa, who had been informally promised early parole from his jury tampering sentence. Chotiner wrote to Haldeman in November 1971, noting that no action on Hoffa's release seemed to be taking place, and President Nixon granted Hoffa clemency later that month. When Chotiner's role became public in 1973, he stated that he was proud <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>actions</b> on behalf of Hoffa. Chotiner also lobbied the White House on behalf of milk producers, who were seeking increased price supports and who were major contributors to the Republican Party.|$|E

5|$|On May 26, 1943, the 32nd Infantry Regiment {{was pinned}} down by enemy {{fire in the}} {{vicinity}} of Fish Hook Ridge, in the Aleutian Islands. On his own account, Martinez led two assaults, firing into the Japanese foxholes and occasionally stopping to urge on his comrades. His example inspired the men of his unit to follow. Martinez {{was shot in the head}} as he approached one final foxhole after the second assault, dying of the wound the following day. Because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>actions</b> the pass was taken, and its capture was an important preliminary to the end of organized hostile resistance. Martinez was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|Orochimaru, however, craved {{more power}} than could be {{obtained}} from training with his master, and began abducting villagers of Konohagakure for various experiments with Yamato among his surviving victims. Unwilling to bring himself to harm Orochimaru upon learning <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>actions,</b> Hiruzen allowed his former pupil to escape and flee the village. In time Orochimaru joined the criminal organization Akatsuki and became partners with a fellow Rogue Ninja named Sasori. However, after his attempt to steal the body of Itachi Uchiha through a forbidden jutsu so as to gain the Sharingan failed, Orochimaru is forced to leave the Akatsuki. Orochimaru then founded his own ninja village, Otogakure, populated with ninja loyal to him who mostly serve as test subjects in his experimentation to become an ultimate being and as pawns to do his dirty work.|$|E
5|$|SNK Playmore staff created Ash as an evil main character, in {{contrast}} to previous main characters. His moves have been reworked in every game {{in which he has}} appeared, gaining new techniques as a result <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>actions</b> or modified to balance the character roster. Critical response to Ash has been largely negative due to his androgynous appearance and his technique. In interviews and press releases, video game publisher UTV Ignition Entertainment noted that he was unpopular with Western gamers and his design was better suited to Japanese fans.|$|E
