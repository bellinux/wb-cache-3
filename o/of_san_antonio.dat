The republic's inability to defend itself added momentum to Texas's eventual annexation into the United States.|$|E

Santa Anna ordered the alcalde <b>of</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio,</b> Francisco Antonio Ruiz, to confirm the identities of Bowie, Travis, and Crockett. After first ordering that Bowie be buried, as he was too brave a man to be burned like a dog, Santa Anna later had Bowie's body placed with those of the other Texians on the funeral pyre.|$|E

5|$|Green Lake formed {{initially}} as {{a northern}} inlet <b>of</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> Bay. As the Guadalupe River shifted westward about 2,500 years ago, it deposited silt, developing a delta that prograded into San Antonio Bay. Around 2,200years ago the delta discharge extended completely across the bay, severing the northern extension from the system, which formed present-day Green Lake. Pottery and burial grounds {{found in the}} area suggest a presence of Karankawa Indians {{at the time of}} formation. Middens uncovered north of the lake contained shells from the brackish water-species of rangia clams (rangia cuneata).|$|E

5|$|The nomadic Karankawa Indians {{used the}} bay for hunting {{before the arrival}} of Europeans, but no major human {{settlements}} were ever established. The unincorporated community of Lamar on Live Oak Peninsula is the only substantial community that borders the bay. The cities of Rockport and Fulton on the main Aransas Bay are located only a few miles away, and the bay is usually considered a part of the collective Rockport-Fulton area. The bay is roughly 150 miles southeast <b>of</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> and about 40 miles northeast of Corpus Christi.|$|E
5|$|After obtaining {{permission}} from the Mexican government to mount an expedition into Indian territory {{to search for the}} legendary silver mine, Bowie, his brother Rezin, and ten others set out for San Saba on November 2, 1831. Six miles (10km) from their goal, the group stopped to negotiate with a large raiding party of Indians—reportedly more than 120 Tawakoni and Waco, plus another 40 Caddo. The attempts at parley failed and Bowie and his group fought for their lives for the next 13hours. When the Indians finally retreated, Bowie reportedly had lost only one man, while more than 40Indians had been killed and 30 were wounded. In the meantime, a party of friendly Comanche rode into San Antonio bringing word of the raiding party, which outnumbered the Bowie expedition by 14 to 1. The citizens <b>of</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> believed the members of the Bowie expedition must have perished, and Ursula Bowie began wearing widow's weeds.|$|E
5|$|During the {{campaign}} to conquer the Itza of Petén, the Spanish sent expeditions to harass and relocate the Mopan north of Lake Izabal and the Ch'ol Maya of the Amatique forests to the east. They were resettled in the Colonial reducción <b>of</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> de las Bodegas on the south shore {{of the lake and}} in San Pedro de Amatique. By {{the latter half of the}} 18th century the indigenous population of these towns had disappeared; the local inhabitants now consisted entirely of Spaniards, mulattos and others of mixed race, all associated with the Castillo de San Felipe de Lara fort guarding the entrance to Lake Izabal. The main cause of the drastic depopulation of Lake Izabal and the Motagua Delta was the constant slave raids by the Miskito Sambu of the Caribbean coast that effectively ended the Maya population of the region; the captured Maya were sold into slavery in the British colony of Jamaica.|$|E

In 1939, as ground broke on the <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> River Walk development, city {{officials}} led by Mayor Maury Maverick acted to preserve this part <b>of</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio's</b> history. It was a Native American settlement and then a collection of primitive brush huts, called jacales, for the Spanish soldiers (and their Indian wives and children) stationed nearby at the Mission <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> de Valero (an active mission from about 1718 to 1793, now {{better known as the}} Alamo). After a flood in 1819 washed away most of the huts, more substantial adobe houses replaced them.|$|R

5|$|In 1791 and 1792, Fray José Francisco Garza befriended {{some of the}} Karankawa {{and other}} native peoples. Their {{friendship}} allowed Garza to explore much of the coastal areas that had been too dangerous to visit. The Indians requested that Garza build a mission at the junction of the San Antonio and Guadalupe Rivers, and in February 1793 Mission Nuestra Señora del Refugio opened near Mission Lake at the head <b>of</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> Bay. Over 230Indians lived at the mission initially, but within two years {{they were forced to}} move to a less flood-prone site, which became known as Refugio. By {{the end of the eighteenth}} century, only a small number of the hunting and gathering tribes within Texas had not been Christianized. In 1793, mission San Antonio de Valero was secularized, and the following year the four remaining missions at San Antonio were partially secularized.|$|E
5|$|The Comanches {{were willing}} to fight the enemies of their new friends, and soon {{attacked}} the Karankawa. Over the next several years, the Comanches killed many of the Karankawa {{in the area and}} drove the others into Mexico. By 1804, very few natives lived on the barrier islands, where the Karankawa had made their home. In January 1790, the Comanche also helped the Spanish fight a large battle against the Mescalero and Lipan Apaches at Soledad Creek west <b>of</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio.</b> Over 1000Comanche warriors participated in raids against the Apache in 1791 and 1792, and the Apache were forced to scatter into the mountains in Mexico. In 1796, Spanish officials began an attempt to have the Apache and Comanche coexist in peace, and {{over the next ten years}} the intertribal fighting declined.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Abby was an {{exceptionally}} small tropical cyclone that had minor effects across Southeast Texas in early August 1964. Forming as a tropical depression {{out of a}} trough south of Louisiana on August5, the system moved generally westward. It was not until August7 that the system began to organize. That day, an eye rapidly formed within the system {{and it became a}} tropical storm just 60mi (95km) southeast of Galveston, Texas. Soon thereafter, a weather reconnaissance plane reported a barometric pressure of 1000mbar (hPa; 29.53inHg) at the storm's center. Around 18:00UTC (1:00p.m. CDT), the newly named Abby attained peak winds of 65mph (100km/h). It subsequently made landfall near Matagorda, Texas four hours later. Once onshore gradual weakening ensued, though a brief period of re-organization delayed its dissipation. Abby degenerated into an area of showers on August8 southwest <b>of</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio,</b> Texas.|$|E

At the Royal Rumble, Jericho, with the help of Christian, eliminated Michaels. Michaels defeated Jericho at WrestleMania XIX. Despite this, Michaels was low-blowed after hugging with Chris Jericho. On the final episode of Raw of 2003, Michaels would defeat Triple H after a Sweet Chin Music for the World Heavyweight title in his hometown <b>of</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio,</b> Texas with Eric Bischoff as the special guest referee (Earl Hebner originally refereed the match, only to be knocked out by Triple H {{in the middle of the}} match). However, Bischoff reversed the decision due to both men's shoulders being on the mat. Angered by this, Michaels attacked Ric Flair and Bischoff. Because of Michaels putting his hands on Bischoff, Bischoff then fired him. However, Michaels would be rehired by Steve Austin.|$|E
5|$|SH151 {{begins at}} Loop1604, the outer loop around San Antonio, {{on the west}} side <b>of</b> <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> and from there follows a southeastern path through {{the western part of the}} city.

Microsoft has also selected the corridor for a $550 million data center. The highway continues to the southeast to a junction with Interstate 410 (I-410), the inner loop around San Antonio. There is not a direct connect interchange at the junction of I-410. It is necessary to travel on both highways' frontage roads in order to change highways. The highway continues to the southeast through mainly undeveloped land until it merges with US90. According to the San Antonio Master Thoroughfare Plan, there are plans to extend SH 151 westward from Loop1604 to SH211. The plan also shows the construction of an interchange at Loop 1604.|$|E
