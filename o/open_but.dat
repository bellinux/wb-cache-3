5|$|Federer {{made the}} final of the Canadian <b>Open</b> <b>but</b> was {{defeated}} by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Federer defeated Spain's David Ferrer in three sets to capture his sixth Cincinnati crown and 22nd ATP World Tour Masters 1000 title, his first in Cincinnati since 2012. He then reached the semifinals at the US <b>Open</b> <b>but</b> lost in straight sets to eventual champion Marin Čilić. At the Davis Cup semifinals, Federer won both his singles matches against Italy in straight sets and led Switzerland to the final {{for the first time since}} 1992.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} proposal {{would keep the}} existing station <b>open</b> <b>but</b> with many services calling only at a new Westbrae Drive station. This proposal was backed in August 2001 by Charlie Gordon, then leader of Glasgow City Council, who said that having a second station in Jordanhill would assist students at the nearby Jordanhill campus of the University of Strathclyde. The proposed new station would have been only roughly 500 yd (460 m) away.|$|E

She recovered quickly from the injury and entered the Rogers Cup, but lost to Simona Halep in the first round. As 14th-seed, she {{made it to the}} third round of the Western & Southern Open and was beaten by eventual champion Maria Sharapova. Kuznetsova reached the fourth round of the US Open in which she lost to top-seeded Wozniacki.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{participated in}} several tournaments after the Olympic Games without {{capturing}} a title. He {{advanced to the}} finals of the Japan Open, the Macau Open and the China <b>Open,</b> <b>but</b> lost to Sony Dwi Kuncoro, Taufik Hidayat, and Lin Dan respectively. In the French Open Lee was eliminated in the semi-finals. His coach, Misbun Sidek, cited the pressure of being ranked world number one to explain Lee's recent failure to capture a title.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{returned}} to form at the Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters, but lost to Nadal in the semifinals. Murray sustained an elbow injury before the match and subsequently {{withdrew from the}} 2011 Barcelona Open Banco Sabadell due to the injury.

5|$|O'Sullivan {{went out}} of the Malta Cup with a 3–5 loss to Michael Holt in the first round. He reached the quarter-finals of the Welsh <b>Open,</b> <b>but</b> lost 4–5 against Neil Robertson. In his quarter-final match against Joe Swail at the Irish Masters, O'Sullivan {{compiled}} a maximum break {{on his way to a}} narrow 5–4 victory, the second 147 in any professional competition in Ireland. The initial maximum break prize of a Citroën Coupe, worth €20,000, was later withdrawn by the organisers. He then defeated John Higgins 6–5 in the semi-finals, and won the title by defeating Barry Hawkins 9–1 in the final. O'Sullivan then reached the semi-finals of the China <b>Open,</b> <b>but</b> lost 2–6 against eventual champion Graeme Dott. Just before the World Championship, in which he was to play a first-round match with Ding Junhui again, O'Sullivan claimed that the draw was fixed. This was subsequently denied by World Snooker, and O'Sullivan later retracted his accusation. In the end, O'Sullivan won the tie easily by 10 frames to 2. He also won his second-round match against Robertson 13–10 (despite losing six frames in a row at one point), before losing his quarter-final match 9–13 against eventual champion John Higgins.|$|E
5|$|On February 1, 1894, {{the mine}} owners began {{implementing}} the 10-hour day. Union president John Calderwood issued a notice {{a week later}} demanding that the mine owners reinstate the eight-hour day at the $3.00 wage. When the owners did not respond, the nascent union struck on February 7. Portland, Pikes Peak, Gold Dollar and a few smaller mines immediately agreed to the eight-hour day and remained <b>open,</b> <b>but</b> larger mines held out.|$|E
5|$|The Base Realignment and Closure 2005 {{commission}} {{originally planned}} to close Otis Air National Guard Base and dissolve the 102d. Locals {{argued that this}} would leave a huge gap in the national air defenses. Commission officials, after visiting the base, decided to keep it <b>open,</b> <b>but</b> the 102d would still lose its planes, only this time they were only going to the 104th Fighter Wing, based at Barnes Municipal Airport.|$|E

5|$|The {{west side}} (numbers 14–18 and 18A, 19 and 20) was {{designed}} by John Pinch the younger in 1830 and differs from Wood's original design as the central block is in Neo-Grecian style. The Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution (BRLSI) now occupies 16–18. The south side (numbers 5–13) was originally left <b>open,</b> <b>but</b> is now occupied by a hotel. The obelisk in {{the centre of the}} square was erected by Beau Nash in 1738.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the first attack took place, {{the walls of the}} fort still had not been finished, {{although}} they had been raised slightly. As a result of the hasty construction work, even at the wall's lowest part, it was high enough that the attacking force would need ladders to reach the top of the rampart. Every point where the fort was approachable, or thought weak by its defenders, was bolstered by stockades made out of stones and stakes that had been stuck into the ground. These were covered by cannons that were placed where they could be most effective, and a wicket gate that flanked {{a large part of the}} wall, was left <b>open</b> <b>but</b> cross-barred, to make it difficult for attacking soldiers to enter but also to channel their advance towards a cannon that had been placed at the gate to enfilade its approach with showers of grapeshot.|$|E

5|$|EVE {{brings the}} plant back to McCrea, who watches EVE's {{recordings}} of Earth and concludes {{that they must}} return. However, AUTO refuses, revealing his own secret no-return directive A113, issued to BnL autopilots after the corporation concluded years earlier that the planet could not be saved. He mutinies, tasering WALL-E and deactivating EVE and throwing them both down the garbage chute, then detaining McCrea. EVE automatically reactivates and helps WALL-E bring the plant to the ship's Holo-Detector chamber; AUTO tries to close the chamber, crushing WALL-E when he struggles to keep it <b>open,</b> <b>but</b> McCrea is able to deactivate him and destroy GO-4, while EVE inserts the plant to activate the hyperjump.|$|E
5|$|He {{went on to}} play in Rotterdam at the 2012 ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam, {{where he}} was third seed. Here he {{defeated}} Tomáš Berdych {{in order to make}} it to his first final of an ATP 500 level tournament or higher after returning from his wrist injury in 2010. He lost to Federer in straight sets in the final. At the Open 13 in Marseille, del Potro defeated Davydenko, Gasquet, Tsonga, and Michaël Llodra in the final to get his tenth ATP championship. Del Potro then had a good run in Dubai, reaching the semifinals, then losing to Roger Federer again in straight sets. Del Potro lost in the quarterfinals of the BNP Paribas Open to Federer for the fourth time that year. He made it to the fourth round of the Sony Ericsson <b>Open,</b> <b>but</b> lost to David Ferrer in two sets.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Wimbledon, Robson {{entered the}} XXV Italiacom Open in Palermo where she reached her first ever WTA semifinal. After beating the world No. 240 Valentyna Ivakhnenko {{for the loss}} of just one game in the first round, she shocked the No. 2 seed and world No. 27, Roberta Vinci in {{straight}} sets to reach her first ever WTA quarter final. She continued her good form in the quarter final, where she emerged victorious against the world No. 41 and No. 5 seed Carla Suárez Navarro in three sets. However, her run came to an end when she lost in the semifinals to Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová in three sets. Robson then received a wild card to enter the main draw of the Swedish <b>Open</b> <b>but</b> lost her first match against Anabel Medina Garrigues.|$|E

In June, Lee won his 6th and record-equaling Indonesia Open title, becoming the third shuttler and first non-Indonesian to win the title six times. He was set to play in the Australian <b>Open,</b> <b>but</b> withdrew due to a muscle injury.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, the Ministry of Justice {{announced}} plans to close 54 county courts and 103 magistrates' courts in England and Wales, {{in order to save}} £15m in annual running costs and £22m in necessary maintenance. The courts threatened with closure in Wales were Aberdare, Llangefni, Pontypool and Rhyl. In addition, it was proposed that Newport County Court would no longer hold hearings at Chepstow every fortnight (as had been done since the county court there closed in 2002). After consultation, it was decided to keep Llangefni County Court <b>open,</b> <b>but</b> the other closures were confirmed.|$|E
5|$|In March, Lee {{lost in the}} All England Open when {{he bowed}} out {{in the second game}} after {{receiving}} medical help on three occasions. This also dashed Lee's hopes of becoming the first man to win three successive All England Open titles. In April, he was defeated by South Korean Shon Wan-ho in the final of the India <b>Open,</b> <b>but</b> retained his Malaysia Open Grand Prix Gold title for the fourth time in a row in May. Lee was out for three to four weeks after suffering an ankle injury during the Thomas Cup Group C tie against Denmark.|$|E
