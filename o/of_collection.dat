5|$|Beetles are {{prominent}} in human culture, from the sacred scarabs of ancient Egypt to beetlewing art and use as pets or fighting insects for entertainment and gambling. Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects <b>of</b> <b>collection</b> and decorative displays. Over 300 species {{are used as}} food, mostly as larvae; species widely consumed include mealworms and rhinoceros beetle larvae. However, the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural pests. Serious pests include the boll weevil of cotton, the Colorado potato beetle, the coconut hispine beetle, and the mountain pine beetle. Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the lady beetles and dung beetles are beneficial by helping to control insect pests.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its parental species, A.bradleyi hybridizes with several other spleenworts. Its hybrid with A.pinnatifidum was recognized as such by William R. Maxon in 1918. He named it A.gravesii for its discoverer, Edward W. Graves. It can also backcross with its parental species. Wherry collected specimens of A.bradleyi ×montanum from a cliff near Blairstown, New Jersey in 1935. It is not {{thought to have been}} collected again until 1961, when it was described and named in Wherry's honor. Specimens believed to be A.bradleyi ×platyneuron were collected at an early date at McCall's Ferry, along the Susquehanna River. The site <b>of</b> <b>collection</b> was submerged by the building of the Holtwood Dam. A preliminary report of both diploid A.bradleyi and A.bradleyi ×platyneuron from Sequatchie County, Tennessee was made in 1989.|$|E

5|$|As chief {{financial}} administrator, he bore {{the brunt of}} the chronicler's condemnations for extortion and efforts to increase royal revenues. Besides attempts to increase the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>collection</b> and the rate of taxation, Ranulf created new methods of raising money. One of his new measures in revenue collection came in 1094, when the fyrd, or English militia, was assembled to fight in Normandy against the king's brother Robert Curthose. When all the men had assembled, instead of sending them to Normandy, Ranulf dismissed them, after collecting the 10 shillings that each man had been given by their district for maintenance. Ranulf then spent the money on mercenaries. Ranulf also actively pressed lawsuits, including bringing suit against Anselm on the day of Anselm's consecration as Archbishop of Canterbury. Another innovation was the attempt to collect a relief, much like the relief due from vassals at the death of an overlord, from the under-tenants of church lands when the church office changed hands. This attempt came at the death of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester in 1095, when the king sent writs to the free tenants of the bishop, setting the amount of relief owed to the king. This attempt was not repeated, however.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1982, Aloi and Ringler {{conducted}} a mark and recapture study in the patch of watercress where the snails appeared most densely. Using two methods (Jolly and Schnabel) and two models, they estimated {{a population of about}} 300 snails with a density of four snails per square meter of watercress habitat. These snails have subsequently been identified as Succinea sp. B, not Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. A 1983 collection of 83 snails for use in electrophoretic studies resulted in removal of 24 Novisuccinea chittenangoensis from the population; unfortunately, their identity was not verified at the time <b>of</b> <b>collection,</b> on top of which Novisuccinea chittenangoensis was thought to be more abundant than it actually was. The population of Succinea sp. B expanded rapidly to an estimate of more than 3,000 snails in 1984, whereas counts of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis in 1984 indicated the presence of approximately 100 adults. Counts of live Novisuccinea chittenangoensis from 1995 to 2001 yielded an average of five adults per survey with a high of 12 adults in 2001. and post-reproductive shell counts made {{at the end of each}} activity season from 1987 to 2001 generally identified 4 to 20 Novisuccinea chittenangoensis adults. Subsequent studies have shown that Succinea sp. B outnumbers Novisuccinea chittenangoensis by as much as 10 to 1 in the primary habitat areas.|$|E
