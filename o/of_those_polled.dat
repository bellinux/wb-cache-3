40|$|Media {{projections}} may {{be based}} both on exit polls and on information acquired as to actual ballot counts. The First Amendment would generally preclude Congress from prohibiting the media from interviewing voters after they exit the polls.

50|$|Failure to make {{adequate}} {{provision for}} disabled electors {{can result in}} the selective disenfranchisement of disabled people. Accessibility issues {{need to be considered}} in electoral law, voter registration, provisions for postal voting, the selection of polling stations, the physical equipment <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>polling</b> stations and the training of polling station staff. This disenfranchisement may be a deliberate facet of electoral law, a consequence of a failure to consider the needs of anyone other than non-disabled electors, or an ongoing failure to respond to identified shortcomings in provision.|$|R
5|$|A CeSID poll in June 2015 {{conducted}} {{with the support of}} the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) indicated that only 12 percent <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>polled</b> supported for NATO membership, down from 25 percent in 2012, and 73 percent were opposed. The minor Liberal Democratic Party and Serbian Renewal Movement remain the most vocal political parties in favor of NATO membership. Although Serbia aspires to join the European Union, Serbia may seek to maintain military neutrality, joining neither NATO nor the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO).|$|E
5|$|Although a {{potential}} local ownership group was identified in late February, local {{opposition to a}} perceived bailout of multi-millionaire ownership began to take hold. A citizens opposition group called Don't Target Us (referencing the Target Center in their name) formed to voice their opposition to a public purchase of the facility. Additionally, polling at the time showed support for public intervention as being unfavorable with 60 percent <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>polled</b> being against intervention. However support for intervention on the arena issue {{began to take shape}} as well with several at the local and state level stating their intention to make a deal happen. Additionally, businesses near the arena starting a campaign to keep the team in Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|Protests erupted {{soon after}} the release of the video, and on Black Friday protesters shut down part of the city's Magnificent Mile. Public calls for {{resignation}} grew steadily over this period, including a well-circulated op-ed published in The New York Times. By early December, Emanuel's approval rating had sunk to 18%, with 67% of Chicagoans disapproving of his job performance and slightly more than half <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>polled</b> calling for his resignation. During the week of December 10, protestors blocked streets and continued to call for Emanuel to resign. Additional protests against Emanuel and Chicago's Police Department were held on the city's busy Michigan Avenue shopping area on December 24, 2015.|$|E

2500|$|Clinton {{continued}} to poll high, with a September 2011 Bloomberg News poll finding {{her with a}} 64percent favorable rating, the highest of any political figure in the nation. A third <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>polls</b> said that Clinton {{would have been a}} better president than Obama, but when asked the likelihood she would stage a campaign against the president, she said, [...] "It's below zero. One {{of the great things about}} being secretary of state is I am out of politics. I am not interested in being drawn back into it by anybody." ...|$|R
25|$|On September 15, 2009, the foreign-dominated ECC {{ordered a}} recount of 2,600, or 10%, of the country's 26,000 polling {{stations}} – {{many of them}} in southern Afghanistan – a move expected to strip votes away from incumbent President Hamid Karzai. Because many <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>polling</b> stations had substantially higher turnouts than average, possibly the result of ballot stuffing, more than 10% of the vote could be affected. With the September 12 partial results showing Karzai at 54.3% of the votes, just 4.3 points above the 50% threshold, the ECC-ordered recount could potentially force a run-off election.|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} the provincial {{election}} was called in September 2011, support for Dunderdale, her government and the Progressive Conservatives had fallen in public opinion polls. However, her party entered the campaign with support levels in the high fifties and Dunderdale remained the top choice for premier. On October 11, 2011, Dunderdale led her party to victory winning 56 per cent of the popular vote, which was consistent with polling throughout the campaign. After an initial bounce in the polls following the election, support for Dunderdale would decline right up until her resignation as premier in 2014. Throughout 2012, Dunderdale saw her personal numbers take a big hit, while PC Party support and government satisfaction would also decline. In November 2012, 36 per cent of respondents to a CRA poll thought Dunderdale was {{the best choice for}} premier, down from 59 per cent a year earlier. Although the Progressive Conservatives still remained in first place their support had fallen 14 points over the year to 46 per cent. While government satisfaction had fallen it remained high, with 58 percent of respondents either being completely or mostly satisfied. An Angus Reid poll released in December 2012, also showed declining support for Dunderdale over the year. Just 37 per cent <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>polled</b> approved of the job Dunderdale was doing as premier, while 55 per cent disapproved.|$|E

25|$|The {{slide in}} Conservative support began in early 2000, {{according}} to the Ipsos-Reid polling company, when the Tories fell behind the Liberals in the public opinion polls {{for the first time}} since the 1999 election, with 36% support <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>polled,</b> compared to 42% for the Liberals and 17% for the NDP. Later in 2000, Liberal support rose to about half <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>polled,</b> while Conservative support remained in the low 30s. This pattern held through to the 2002 leadership campaign, when Conservative support rose to 37%, while the Liberals retained the support of about half <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>polled.</b>|$|E
