5|$|Cluj-Napoca hosts an ethnographic museum, the Ethnographic Museum of Transylvania, which {{features}} a large indoor collection of traditional cultural <b>objects,</b> <b>as</b> well as an open-air park, the oldest of this kind in Romania, dating back to 1929.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{relatively}} smaller brains {{compared to}} other primates, lemurs have demonstrated levels of technical intelligence in problem solving that are comparable to those seen in simians. However, their social intelligence differs, often emphasizing within-group competition over cooperation, which {{may be due to}} adaptations for their unpredictable environment. Although lemurs have not been observed using <b>objects</b> <b>as</b> tools in the wild, they can be trained to use <b>objects</b> <b>as</b> tools in captivity and demonstrate a basic understanding about the functional properties of the objects they are using.|$|E
5|$|Flagella are {{semi-rigid}} cylindrical {{structures that}} are rotated and function {{much like the}} propeller on a ship. <b>Objects</b> <b>as</b> small as bacteria operate a low Reynolds number and cylindrical forms are more efficient than the flat, paddle-like, forms appropriate at human-size scale.|$|E

5|$|Infrared {{light is}} of lower energy than visible light, hence is emitted by cooler <b>objects.</b> <b>As</b> such, the {{following}} {{can be viewed}} in the infrared: cool stars (including brown dwarves), nebulae, and redshifted galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Varieties of {{strength}} athletics, {{such as the}} World's Strongest Man and highland games, often incorporate forms of footracing carrying heavy <b>objects</b> <b>as</b> well as throwing {{events such as the}} caber toss and keg toss, which bear similarities to track and field throwing events.|$|E
5|$|Ecliptic {{coordinates}} are {{convenient for}} specifying positions of Solar System <b>objects,</b> <b>as</b> {{most of the}} planets' orbits have small inclinations to the ecliptic, and therefore always appear relatively close to it on the sky. Because Earth's orbit, and hence the ecliptic, moves very little, it is a relatively fixed reference {{with respect to the}} stars.|$|E

5|$|Japanese lacquerwork {{reached its}} apogee in the 17th century Edo period when lacquer {{was used for}} {{decorative}} <b>objects</b> <b>as</b> well as everyday items such as combs, tables, bottle, headrests, small boxes or writing cases. The most famous artist of this time was the lacquerer painter Ogata Kōrin. He {{was the first to}} use mother of pearl and pewter in larger quantities for decorating lacquerware.|$|E
5|$|Morris’s {{aesthetic}} and social values became a leading {{force in the}} Arts and Crafts Movement. The Kelmscott Press influenced much of the fine press movement in England and the United States during {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries. It brought the need for books that were aesthetic <b>objects</b> <b>as</b> well as words to the attention of the reading and publishing worlds.|$|E
5|$|SDOs are {{typically}} characterized by orbits with medium and high eccentricities with a semi-major axis greater than 50AU, but their perihelia bring them within influence of Neptune. Having a perihelion of roughly 30AU {{is one of}} the defining characteristics of scattered <b>objects,</b> <b>as</b> it allows Neptune to exert its gravitational influence.|$|E

5|$|The {{eccentricity}} of {{an orbit}} describes how elongated a planet's orbit is. Planets with low eccentricities have more circular orbits, whereas planets with high eccentricities have more elliptical orbits. The planets in the Solar System have very low eccentricities, and thus nearly circular orbits. Comets and Kuiper belt <b>objects</b> (<b>as</b> {{well as several}} extrasolar planets) have very high eccentricities, and thus exceedingly elliptical orbits.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{account of}} the incident indicated that police, using a megaphone, had ordered protesters to evacuate the area and that some had done so, whereas others remained {{in defiance of the}} law. It added that police only intervened after exhausting all opportunities for dialogue and that lethal shots were fired only at armed protesters who attacked police officers. Security forces reported finding pistols, bullets, large quantities of knives, daggers, swords and other sharp <b>objects,</b> <b>as</b> well as Hezbollah flags at the site.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving employs {{non-linear}} storytelling, {{forcing the}} player {{to piece together}} the narrative. During gameplay, objectives and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects. The player has little control over the game mechanics and is only able to move freely and pick up <b>objects</b> <b>as</b> needed to progress. Several optional actions, such as drinking alcohol, are available at several stages of the game.|$|E

40|$|In {{philosophy}} of mind, we often {{talk about a}} person having a mental representation of aspects of reality. In {{philosophy of}} perception, we discuss {{how it is possible}} for an external reality to have a causal role in creating representations. Many cognitive psychologists who study human and animal perception see the <b>object</b> <b>as</b> the primary unit of perception. My project is to give an account of what the conditions are for the representation of an object. I begin by discussing representation in fairly general terms and then discuss several ways of thinking about the content of representations. Next I give an account of the general conditions for representation. Then, I discuss some areas of research from cognitive science which focus on the <b>object</b> <b>as</b> a primary unit of perception. I argue that in order to represent an <b>object</b> <b>as</b> an <b>object</b> (<b>as</b> opposed to an <b>object</b> <b>as</b> a particular kind of object), one need not {{be able to have a}} representation of an object in terms propositions or concepts...|$|R
5|$|A {{major change}} from The Two Towers is the {{interactive}} {{nature of the}} game environments. The player can operate machinery, for example bridges and catapults, to complete objectives, and use environmental <b>objects</b> <b>as</b> weapons, such as spears and cauldrons, to kill enemies. The levels are also {{twice the size of}} the largest level from The Two Towers and many are less linear. Unlike The Two Towers, The Return of the King features a co-op mode, allowing two players to play through the game together. The North American PlayStation 2 version also has an online multiplayer mode, with USB headset support, although this was removed from the European version of the game.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a new {{emphasis}} on observing, classifying, and cataloging nature, 16th century natural philosophers in Europe began to establish extensive collections of fossil <b>objects</b> (<b>as</b> well as collections of plant and animal specimens), which were often stored in specially built cabinets to help organize them. Conrad Gesner published a 1565 work on fossils that contained one of the first detailed descriptions of such a cabinet and collection. The collection belonged to a member of the extensive network of correspondents that Gesner drew on for his works. Such informal correspondence networks among natural philosophers and collectors became increasingly important {{during the course of the}} 16th century and were direct forerunners of the scientific societies that would begin to form in the 17th century. These cabinet collections and correspondence networks played an important role in the development of natural philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Data {{from the}} ZDR was {{passed to the}} All-Target Processor (ATP), which ran initial {{processing}} on as many as 625 objects in a cloud. As many as 50 of these could be picked out for further processing in the Discrimination and Control Computer (DCC), which ran more tests on those tracks and assigned each one a probability of being the warhead or decoy. The DCC was able to run 100 different tests. For exoatmospheric signals the tests included measure of radar return pulse-to-pulse to look for tumbling <b>objects,</b> <b>as</b> well as variations in signals strength due to changes in frequency. Within the atmosphere, the primary method was examining the velocities of the objects to determine their mass.|$|E

5|$|Further, birds {{recall and}} avoid {{objects that are}} both {{conspicuous}} and foul-tasting longer than objects that are equally foul-tasting but cryptically coloured. This suggests that Wallace's original view, that warning colouration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus coloured, was correct. However, some birds (inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks) also innately avoid conspicuously coloured <b>objects,</b> <b>as</b> demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps, with dull green controls. This implies that warning coloration works {{at least in part}} by stimulating the evolution of predators to encode the meaning of the warning signal, rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal's meaning.|$|E
5|$|Improved {{telescope}} {{technology in}} the late 19th and 20th centuries allowed astronomers to resolve (that is, see as distinct objects) large-scale surface features on Io. In the 1890s, Edward E. Barnard {{was the first to}} observe variations in Io's brightness between its equatorial and polar regions, correctly determining that this was due to differences in color and albedo between the two regions and not due to Io being egg-shaped, as proposed at the time by fellow astronomer William Pickering, or two separate <b>objects,</b> <b>as</b> initially proposed by Barnard. Later telescopic observations confirmed Io's distinct reddish-brown polar regions and yellow-white equatorial band.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, astronomers {{began to}} find {{objects in the}} same region of space as Pluto (now known as the Kuiper belt), and some even farther away. Many of these shared several of Pluto's key orbital characteristics, and Pluto started being seen as the largest member of {{a new class of}} objects, plutinos. This led some astronomers to stop {{referring}} to Pluto as a planet. Several terms, including subplanet and planetoid, started to be used for the bodies now known as dwarf planets. By 2005, three trans-Neptunian objects comparable in size to Pluto (Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris) had been reported. It became clear that either they would also have to be classified as planets, or Pluto would have to be reclassified. Astronomers were also confident that more <b>objects</b> <b>as</b> large as Pluto would be discovered, and the number of planets would start growing quickly if Pluto were to remain a planet.|$|E
