50|$|In {{computer}} programming, the neologisms <b>outdent</b> and unindent {{are used}} to describe the reversal of the indentation process, realigning text with the page margin (or with previous, lesser, levels of indentation).|$|E
50|$|The optimal values {{used for}} the <b>outdents</b> is font dependent. A {{typeface}} that has capital A, V, W, and Y with vertical sides, needs no <b>outdents</b> for these letters, but the capital T and punctuation will still benefit from using Optical Margin Alignment.|$|R
50|$|In ancient manuscripts, another {{means to}} divide {{sentences}} into paragraphs {{was a line}} break (newline) followed by an initial {{at the beginning of}} the next paragraph. An initial is an oversized capital letter, sometimes <b>outdented</b> beyond the margin of the text. This style can be seen, for example, in the original Old English manuscript of Beowulf. <b>Outdenting</b> is still used in English typography, though not commonly.Modern English typography usually indicates a new paragraph by indenting the first line. This style can be seen in the (handwritten) United States Constitution from 1787. For additional ornamentation, a hedera leaf or other symbol can be added to the inter-paragraph whitespace, or put in the indentation space.|$|R
50|$|Larssen {{sheet piling}} {{is a kind}} of sheet piling {{retaining}} wall. Segments with indented profiles (troughs) interlock to form a wall with alternating indents and <b>outdents.</b> The troughs increase resistance to bending. The segments are typically made of steel or another metal.|$|R
50|$|It is {{designed}} to be used for body text, not for artistic text, table text, or headlines. It also works well for block quotes, which benefit from “hung punctuation.” The “Smart Quotes” are <b>outdented</b> 100% into the margin or paragraph indent, so that subsequent lines of text align with the first character in the quotation.|$|R
50|$|Optical margin {{alignment}} <b>outdents</b> letters like A, V, W, Y, and punctuation {{into the}} margins to align the text border optically. Some users remark {{that it makes}} the text margin look crooked, but this is because text frames or margin guides are visible. If text frames are not visible, e.g. in print preview, or when printed, {{the edge of a}} block of text looks more even if optical margin alignment is enabled.|$|R
40|$|A special fibre-optic {{interferometer}} {{is proposed}} for 3 D profilometry. Sinusoidal fringes {{are produced by}} the interference of two spherical wavefronts emitted from the output fibres of a directional coupler. The fringe pattern is projected on an object surface and the deformed grating image is captured by a CCD camera. Subsequently, the captured image is analysed, {{and the relationship between}} the fringe phase and the height distribution of the illuminated surface is derived. The proposed method is simple and accurate. It is suitable for automatic measurements. Detailed theoretical and experimental results are presented. Tests show that the system can detect indents and <b>outdents</b> with a maximum depth of less than 10 um...|$|R
