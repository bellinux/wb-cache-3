5|$|Less than 35minutes {{into the}} flight, the hijackers stormed the cockpit. They forced the {{passengers}}, crew, and pilots {{to the rear}} of the aircraft. Hani Hanjour, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> who was trained as a pilot, assumed control of the flight. Unknown to the hijackers, passengers aboard made telephone calls to friends and family and relayed information on the hijacking.|$|E
5|$|By midday, the U.S. National Security Agency and German {{intelligence}} agencies had intercepted communications pointing to Osama bin Laden. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> {{were known to}} have travelled with a bin Laden associate to Malaysia in 2000 and hijacker Mohammed Atta had previously gone to Afghanistan. He and others {{were part of a}} terrorist cell in Hamburg. One {{of the members of the}} Hamburg cell was discovered to have been in communication with Khalid Sheik Mohammed who was identified as a member of al-Qaeda.|$|E
5|$|In {{spring of}} 2001, the {{secondary}} hijackers began {{arriving in the}} United States. In July 2001, Atta met with bin al-Shibh in Spain, where they coordinated details of the plot, including final target selection. Bin al-Shibh also passed along bin Laden's wish for the attacks {{to be carried out}} as soon as possible. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> received passports from corrupt Saudi officials who were family members, or used fraudulent passports to gain entry.|$|E
5|$|Note: This list {{does not}} include <b>the</b> nationalities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five <b>hijackers.</b>|$|R
25|$|After the September 11 attacks, Hanjour's {{family in}} Saudi Arabia vehemently {{stated that they}} could not, and would not, believe he had been {{involved}} as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijacker</b> pilots, and also stated that he had phoned them just eight hours prior to the hijackings and his voice did not sound strange or unusual at all.|$|R
50|$|Al-Ghamdi is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th <b>hijacker</b> {{suspects}} in <b>the</b> September 11 attacks.|$|R
5|$|Saudi {{officials}} later {{stated that}} the names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> were in fact correct, and that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi. In response to 9/11 conspiracy theories surrounding its original news story suggesting hijackers were still alive, the BBC stated in 2006 that later reports on the hijackers superseded the original story. The BBC also explained that confusion arose with the Arabic names that were common.|$|E
5|$|According {{to flight}} attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong, who {{contacted}} American Airlines during the hijacking, the hijackers had stabbed flight attendants Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui and slashed {{the throat of}} passenger Daniel Lewin. Lewin, an American-Israeli Internet entrepreneur who understood Arabic, had served as {{an officer in the}} elite Sayeret Matkal special operations unit of the Israel Defense Forces. Lewin was seated in 9B, and Suqami was directly behind him in 10B. The 9/11 Commission suggested that Suqami may have stabbed and killed Lewin after he attempted to stop the hijacking. Lewin {{is believed to be the}} first fatality in the 9/11 attacks. During a four-minute call to the American Airlines operations center, Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, lack of access to the cockpit, and passenger injuries. She provided the seat locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijackers,</b> which later helped investigators to determine their identities.|$|E
25|$|German police {{expelled}} {{a member}} of the party from Germany for alleged ties to one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> involved in the 11 September 2001 attacks. However, German police said the raids and searches in offices and homes revealed little.|$|E
25|$|The 135 {{surviving}} {{passengers and}} 17 crew members evacuated the aircraft. The only reported injury other than <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijacker</b> was that <b>of</b> a US Air Force lieutenant colonel, a passenger on the flight, who broke his leg exiting via the inflated evacuation chute. The plane took off hours later for Hong Kong {{to have its}} evacuation gear repaired.|$|R
5|$|Note: This list {{does not}} include <b>the</b> nationalities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four <b>hijackers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plane.|$|R
2500|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>hijacker</b> {{was found}} to have acted alone, Italian police took {{statements}} from passengers and searched the aircraft and baggage for a possible accomplice, and due to this process, passengers stayed in Italy during the night. [...] On October 4, a Turkish Airlines Boeing 737, was sent from Turkey to bring the passengers back to Istanbul. The plane departed from Brindisi Airport at 4:15 (UTC) and landed in Istanbul at 5:40 (UTC) with 105 passengers, with <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijacker</b> who had been arrested in Brindisi, and a passenger who wanted to remain in Italy.|$|R
25|$|One of Burns's more notable {{political}} blunders was blaming Canada for lax immigration policies. He {{asserted that}} one or more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> in the September 11 attacks entered the U.S. from Canada, a statement later proved untrue by the Canadian ambassador.|$|E
25|$|Learning of {{the murder}} of a U.S. citizen, fearing the escape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijackers,</b> and desirous for a victory over terrorism, the Reagan {{administration}} ordered the EgyptAir passenger jet to be forced to land so the perpetrators could be brought to justice.|$|E
25|$|Early media {{accounts}} {{said that}} Waleed had earned his pilot's certificate at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in 1997. However, {{after a short}} investigation, Embry-Riddle was discovered to have not had any involvement in the flight training of the terrorists. A former student shared the same name as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijackers,</b> but the student, who is still alive, had no connections to al-Qaeda.|$|E
50|$|At 8:00 am, {{the morning}} after the hijacking, IDF forces began blowing up <b>the</b> houses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{families}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four <b>hijackers.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{landing in}} Newfoundland, the tarmac is {{surrounded}} by U.S. FBI agents. After the passengers disembark, Kyle apologizes to Captain Rich for disrupting the flight but is certain Julia will be found. Angered, Captain Rich demands she drop the charade, stating that the $50 million has been wired. Kyle realizes that Carson is the perpetrator and, assuming <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijacker,</b> demands Carson remain aboard and the crew leave. Carson realizes he cannot refuse without giving himself away.|$|R
2500|$|Passengers {{said that}} <b>the</b> <b>hijacker</b> used no violence. Sabri Abazi, an Albanian member of parliament, {{who was a}} {{passenger}} on the flight, spoke to ANSA news agency by mobile phone on board. Abazi {{said that there was}} one <b>hijacker</b> in <b>the</b> cockpit and another in the cabin, and added that he saw no weapons. Passenger Ergün Erköseoğlu said [...] "I didn't see any suspicious behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijacker.</b> Airplane took off and after 20 minutes later, captain announced that due to technical malfunction we would land in Italy instead of Istanbul". Aviation authorities said that after all the passengers had left the plane, police questioned <b>the</b> <b>hijacker.</b> Abazi said that he saw only one hijacker but had been told by a flight attendant that there were two hijackers on board. Istanbul Governor Muammer Güler reported that <b>the</b> <b>hijacker</b> Ekinci lied to the airliner's pilots that he had at least one accomplice.|$|R
25|$|Osamu Maruoka, {{who also}} led the {{hijacking}} of Japan Air Lines Flight 404 in 1973, escaped and remained a fugitive until 1987 {{when he was}} arrested in Tokyo after entering Japan on a forged passport. Given a life sentence, he died in prison on 29 May 2011. Another <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijackers,</b> Jun Nishikawa, eventually returned to Japan, was arrested, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{handling}} of the incident {{was regarded as a}} success by the Swedish cabinet members. With the Munich massacre having taken place ten days earlier, there was a relief that the hijacking had ended without casualties. However, the Swedish authorities received harsh criticism from the Government of Yugoslavia for having met the demands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijackers.</b> Flight 130 remains the only aircraft to be successfully hijacked in Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Flight 130 was a {{domestic}} scheduled service from Torslanda Airport in Gothenburg to Stockholm Arlanda Airport. On board were {{a crew of}} 4 and 86 passengers. A few minutes after the aircraft departed at 16:30, two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> {{made their way to}} the cockpit. They pointed their guns at a flight attendant and demanded that the aircraft divert to Bulltofta Airport in Malmö. The pilots followed the orders. The pilot released the hijacking alert at 16:51 and the aircraft landed at Bulltofta at 17:10.|$|E
2500|$|Burgniard {{recalled}} that <b>the</b> <b>hijackers,</b> mostly Lotfi, {{did not like}} seeing a lack of adherence to their Islamic beliefs; according to Burgniard, <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> objected {{to men and women}} sitting together and sharing the same toilets and women having uncovered heads. Once they took control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft, <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> forced women with uncovered heads, including the cabin crew members, to cover their heads. Women who did not have veils used aircraft blankets to cover their heads. An elderly Algerian man told the TF1 network that <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> [...] "had a kind of art in their terror. Twenty minutes of relaxation and twenty minutes of torture. You never knew what was next." ...|$|R
5|$|During <b>the</b> {{first leg}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flight, at about 15:00, Keč, wearing a winter coat, {{got up from}} his seat and walked to <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft. A flight {{attendant}} stopped him. After talking for a short while, and another flight attendant came by, he was let into the cockpit. No information about the hijacking {{was given to the}} passengers until arrival at Bodø. Bodø Airport was evacuated and the aircraft parked at Bodø Main Air Station, the military section. After landing, by order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijacker,</b> <b>the</b> passengers were informed that all women, children under 18 and people over 60 were to leave the aircraft. After this had happened, there were 77 passengers and four crew members left. The aircraft departed Bodø at about 16:00 and headed for Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which was closed for all other traffic.|$|R
5|$|It {{states that}} <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arab <b>hijackers</b> {{was created by}} the CIA, and that these Arabs may not even have been aware that the planes were going to crash. Seven <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alleged <b>hijackers</b> are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites observations in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theory that <b>the</b> collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World Trade Center might have been due to explosives. Von Bülow does not believe that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.|$|R
25|$|An Imam, Ghamdi {{was from}} the al Bahah Province of Saudi Arabia, a {{province}} in the south west of Saudi Arabia. It is the capital of Al Bahah Province nestled between the resorts of Mecca and Abha, Al Bahah {{is one of the}} Kingdom’s prime tourist attractions. Ghamdi shared the same tribal affiliation with fellow hijackers Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, and Ahmed al-Haznawi. This group is noted as being some of the more religiously observant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijackers,</b> and they are thought to have met each other some time in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Several 9/11 hijackers, {{including}} al-Haznawi, {{lived in}} Boca Raton, Florida, near American Media Inc. workplace {{of the first}} victim of the anthrax attacks. They also attended flight school there. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> rented apartments from {{a real estate agent}} who was the wife of an editor of The Sun, a publication of American Media. Further, a pharmacist in Delray Beach, Florida, stated he had told the F.B.I. that two of the 9/11 hijackers, Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi, entered the pharmacy seeking medicine to treat irritations on Atta's hands.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} was largely met with disbelief and {{laughter from the}} passengers {{and some of the}} flight attendants, as they thought it was an exercise. Passengers described two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> as calm and with a good comprehension of Swedish, while one was clearly nervous and did not understand Swedish. The hijackers calmly answered questions regarding the action and stated that they intended to have the ambassador's murderer released. They then started making references to the Munich massacre ten days earlier and hinted that a similar situation could arise in the aircraft. Passengers described the hijackers as generally friendly.|$|E
25|$|Original {{plans for}} the 9/11 attacks called for bin al-Shibh to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijacker</b> pilots, along with three other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hamburg cell, {{including}} Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah. From Hamburg, bin al-Shibh applied to take flight training in the United States. At that time, he also applied to Aviation Language Services, which provides language training for student pilots. Bin al-Shibh applied for an entry visa to the United States, four times, and was refused each time. He made visa applications in Germany on May 17, 2000, and again in June, on September 16, and October 25, 2000.|$|R
25|$|At 12 noon, French Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé {{organised}} {{a crisis}} team, and Charles Pasqua, Interior Minister of France, met his aides. French Prime Minister Édouard Balladur was recalled from his Christmas vacation in Chamonix, France, {{and other government}} officials were recalled from their vacations. Balladur recalled spending his entire afternoon on the telephone, trying to determine {{what was happening and}} feeling confusion. According to Balladur, the Algerian authorities wanted {{to crack down on the}} terrorists and that Balladur encountered difficulties discussing the events. At one point, <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> dropped <b>the</b> demand for <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party leaders. Two hours after the hijacking began, <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> asked <b>the</b> captain to depart for Paris so <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> could hold a press conference there. The captain could not take off as the aircraft boarding stairs were still attached to the A300 and the Algerian authorities blocked the runway with parked vehicles. When the captain, forced by <b>the</b> <b>hijackers,</b> asked for <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boarding stairs, the Algerian authorities, determined not to give in to any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijacker</b> demands, refused. <b>The</b> <b>hijackers</b> announced that they would detonate the aircraft unless the Algerian authorities gave in to the demands.|$|R
2500|$|A {{few minutes}} after <b>the</b> {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assault, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passengers had escaped. At that point, three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four <b>hijackers</b> were fatally shot. Delhemme recalled that the cockpit only had himself, the flight engineer, and <b>the</b> last <b>hijacker.</b> Delhemme said that <b>the</b> <b>hijacker</b> could have killed him and his colleagues out of spite, but instead did not. In an interview, Denis Favier explained that there likely was a mutual recognition and [...] "respect" [...] between <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> and <b>the</b> hostages. He believes the bonds between <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> and hostages helped save lives of passengers and crew in the conflict.|$|R
25|$|Known as al-Jaraah al-Ghamdi {{during the}} preparations, {{the only one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> to use a {{variation}} on his own name, Ghamdi quit school to fight in Chechnya against the Russians in 2000, and received a US Visa on September 3 of that year. In November, both he and Salem al-Hazmi flew to Beirut, though on separate flights and at different times. Ghamdi flew on the same flight as a senior Hezbollah operative, although the 9/11 Commission could find no evidence that either knew the other. His family claims to have last seen him in December.|$|E
25|$|Ghamdi {{was from}} the al Bahah {{province}} of Saudi Arabia, and shared the same tribal affiliation with fellow hijackers Ahmed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, and Ahmed al-Haznawi, although he {{was not related to}} either Ghamdi. He may have been in contact with the two Ghamdis and Haznawi as early as 1999. This group is noted as being some of the more religiously observant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijackers.</b> Ghamdi spent time in al Qasim province, Saudi Arabia where he transferred to college but soon dropped out and ceased contact with his family. While there he probably associated with the radical Saudi cleric named Sulayman al-Alwan as several other future hijackers had.|$|E
25|$|Hamza al-Ghamdi and Ahmed al-Ghamdi {{checked out}} of their hotel and called a taxi {{to take them to}} Logan International Airport. They arrived at the United Airlines counter in Terminal C at 06:20 Eastern Time and Ahmed al-Ghamdi checked in two bags. Both hijackers {{indicated}} they wanted to purchase tickets, though they already had paper tickets. They had trouble answering the standard security questions, so the counter agent repeated the questions very slowly until the men gave the correct answers. Hijacker pilot Marwan al-Shehhi checked in a single bag at 06:45, and the other remaining hijackers, Fayez Banihammad and Mohand al-Shehri, checked in at 06:53. Banihammad checked two bags. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> were selected for extra scrutiny by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS).|$|E
5|$|Also, in 2006, Moussaoui, who some {{originally}} suspected {{might have}} been <b>the</b> assigned 20th <b>hijacker,</b> was convicted for <b>the</b> lesser role <b>of</b> conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism and air piracy. He is {{serving a life sentence}} without parole in the United States. Mounir el-Motassadeq, an associate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hamburg-based <b>hijackers,</b> is serving 15 years in Germany for his role in helping <b>the</b> <b>hijackers</b> prepare for <b>the</b> attacks.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1974 film <b>The</b> Taking <b>of</b> Pelham One Two Three, Lt. Garber says <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subway <b>hijackers,</b> [...] "Someone {{down there}} {{knows how to}} drive a train. You don't pick that up {{watching}} Sesame Street".|$|R
25|$|On September 11, 2001, Hazmi boarded American Airlines Flight 77.
