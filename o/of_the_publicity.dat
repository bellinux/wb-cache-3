5|$|Although Casablanca was an A-list {{film with}} {{established}} stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production {{expected it to}} be anything out of the ordinary. It was just one of hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood every year. Casablanca was rushed into release to take advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> the {{correspondence}} created, {{a freedom of}} information request was lodged concerning Project A119. It was only then that A Study of Lunar Research Flightsâ€“ Volume I was made public, over forty years after its inception. A search for the other volumes of documentation revealed that other reports were destroyed in the 1980s by the Illinois Institute of Technology.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, the American palaeontologists Walter Granger and William K. Gregory {{proposed}} that Forster-Cooper's Baluchitherium osborni was likely a junior synonym (an invalid {{name for the}} same taxon) of Paraceratherium bugtiense, because these specimens were collected at the same locality and were possibly {{part of the same}} morphologically variable species. William Diller Matthew and Forster-Cooper himself had expressed similar doubts few years earlier. Although it had already been declared a junior synonym, the genus name Baluchitherium remained popular in various media because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> surrounding Osborn's B. grangeri.|$|E

5|$|The filmmakers {{retained}} {{the names of}} most of the case's real-life protagonists, but the names of several supporting characters were altered. For example, the character of Candace was named Lisa Lambert in real life. The casting process for Boys Don't Cry lasted almost four years. Drew Barrymore was an early candidate to star in the film. Peirce scouted the LGBT community, looking mainly for masculine, lesbian women for the role of Brandon Teena. Peirce said the LGBT community was very interested in the project because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> surrounding the murder. High-profile actors avoided Peirce's auditions at the request of their agents because of the stigma associated with the role.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{dismissal}} {{from the}} Comintern, Pepper {{went to work}} in the Soviet government. At the time of his 1937 arrest, Pepper was serving as the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> department of the People's Commissariat of the Food Industry.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Breckinridge was {{surprised}} to find himself portrayed as a character in a major motion picture, played by Bill Murray in Tim Burton's 1994 biopic Ed Wood. His advanced years and failing health, however, prevented him from participating in any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> surrounding the film.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{inaccurate}} <b>publicity,</b> {{some news}} publications {{were led to}} speculate whether the M113 APC was obsolete and unsafe for use in peacekeeping missions.|$|R

25|$|During the occupation, President Richard Nixon {{rescinded}} the Indian termination policy, {{designed by}} earlier administrations to end federal recognition of tribes and their {{special relationship with}} the US government. He established a new policy of self-determination, in part as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> and awareness created by the occupation. The occupation ended on June 11, 1971.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007 Ablett {{hit back}} at media claims {{that his son}} Nathan had walked away from his {{football}} career because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> surrounding {{the release of a}} new book about his father. Although normally reluctant to make public comments, Ablett felt that the media intrusion into his family life had gone too far.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heavy <b>publicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case, the Sifrits' {{trials were}} {{moved out of}} Worcester County, Maryland. Benjamin's trial was held in Rockville, Maryland, and Erika's was held in Frederick.|$|R
50|$|However, in <b>the</b> wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bad <b>publicity</b> and lawsuits, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> users on Kazaa Lite {{has dropped}} dramatically. They {{have gone from}} several {{millions}} of users {{at a given time}} to mere thousands.|$|R

25|$|In September 1966, Weissmuller joined former screen Tarzans James Pierce and Jock Mahoney {{to appear}} with Ron Ely as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> for the {{upcoming}} premiere of the Tarzan TV series. In the late 60s and early 70s, Weissmuller was involved with a tourist attraction called Tropical/Florida Wonderland, a.k.a. Tarzan's Jungleland, on US1 in Titusville, Florida.|$|E
25|$|Some state {{officials}} and Arkansas residents {{objected to the}} creation of the theme park because they thought that it would encourage negative hillbilly stereotypes. Lou Oberste <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Publicity</b> and Parks Commission expressed reservations, and Commission Director Bob Evans agreed that Arkansas had difficulty shedding a similar image created by comedic actor Bob Burns.|$|E
25|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> for {{the rally}} was {{distributed}} through online media and blogs. Initially, the organisers {{planned to have}} a gathering point at Dataran Merdeka square. However, it was later revealed {{that this was a}} red herring to distract the police. The locations of the four gathering points were only released the day before the protests by word of mouth, mobile phones and emails.|$|E
25|$|In mid-May 2005, Lacoste {{announced}} {{that as a}} result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international <b>publicity</b> over <b>the</b> revelations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prince's son, Prince Albert was suing the Daily Mail, Bunte, and Paris Match for delving too deeply into his private life.|$|R
50|$|He {{arrived in}} Wagga Wagga and {{introduced}} {{himself to the}} editor as <b>the</b> great grandson <b>of</b> a local property owner. The paper ran a story <b>of</b> him and <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> enabled him to sell his book.|$|R
2500|$|While many {{additional}} charges {{could have been}} brought, authorities concluded that a fair hearing would be impossible in view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enormous <b>publicity</b> surrounding <b>the</b> original trial. [...] Furthermore, the 15 life sentences already handed down rendered further litigation unnecessary.|$|R
25|$|In {{part because}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> {{surrounding}} this case, the law under which Wilson was convicted was changed after his conviction; the act {{would now be}} treated as a misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of one year in prison, and no sex offender registration. While Wilson's attorneys argued that such a change in the law should reverse his conviction, the Legislature specifically prohibited the bill from being applied retroactively.|$|E
25|$|Sugihara {{died the}} {{following}} year {{at a hospital in}} Kamakura, on 31 July 1986. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> given him in Israel and other nations, he remained virtually unknown in his home country. Only when a large Jewish delegation from around the world, including the Israeli ambassador to Japan, showed up at his funeral, did his neighbors find out what he had done. He may have lost his diplomatic career but he received much posthumous acclaim.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1916, Moore-Jones was repatriated to New Zealand and {{discharged}} from the NZEF due to being medically unfit for active duty. He returned to his family in Auckland and continued creating paintings of the Gallipoli Campaign in between portraiture commissions. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> of his showings in England, there was considerable interest in his Gallipoli work and in November 1916, he gave {{the first of what}} proved to be several exhibitions, accompanied by a lecture, of his paintings.|$|E
50|$|Following Ruby's March 1964 {{conviction}} for murder with malice, Ruby's lawyers, led by Sam Houston Clinton, appealed, arguing {{that he could}} not have received a fair trial in <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Dallas because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excessive <b>publicity</b> surrounding <b>the</b> case.|$|R

25|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{widespread}} <b>publicity</b> given to <b>the</b> citizenship controversy, 60% of respondents in an Ohio State University survey {{carried out in}} November 2008 had heard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issue. However, only 10% believed the claims that Obama was not a citizen.|$|R
25|$|Chichen Itza, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the second-most visited of Mexico's {{archaeological site}}s. The archaeological site draws many {{visitors}} {{from the popular}} tourist resort of CancÃºn, who make a day trip on tour buses. In 2007, Chichen Itza's El Castillo was {{named one of the}} New Seven Wonders of the World after a worldwide vote. Despite the fact that the vote was sponsored by a commercial enterprise, and that its methodology was criticized, the vote was embraced by government and tourism officials in Mexico who project that as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> the number of tourists expected to visit Chichen will double by 2012.|$|E
25|$|Sixty {{hours of}} audio- and {{videotape}} {{were removed from}} the laboratory during a raid in May 1984 by the Animal Liberation Front, who handed it over to PETA. It was subsequently edited down to 26 minutes with a voice-over commentary by Newkirk, before being distributed to the media and Congress. Charles McCarthy, director of the Office for Protection from Research Risks (OPRR) wrote that the film had overstated the deficiencies in the clinic, but that the OPRR had found serious violations of the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity,</b> the lab was closed, the chief veterinarian fired, and the university placed on probation.|$|E
25|$|The trial {{had several}} {{important}} legal ramifications. It established {{the doctrine of}} double effect, whereby a doctor giving treatment {{with the aim of}} relieving pain may, as an unintentional result, shorten life. Secondly, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> surrounding Adams's committal hearing, the law was changed to allow defendants to ask for such hearings to be held in private. Finally, though a defendant had never been required to give evidence in his own defence, the judge underlined in his summing-up that no prejudice should be attached by the jury to Adams not doing so. The case, and the inability to convict Adams of murder, is also known for widely suspected political interference from Sir Roland Gwynne, ex-Attorney-General Sir Hartley Shawcross, and various members of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's government.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> <b>publicity</b> {{surrounding}} this case, Elisa Baker's attorney, Scott Reilly requested a change <b>of</b> venue for <b>the</b> trial, {{which was supposed}} to occur in Catawba County. On August 1, 2011, a change <b>of</b> venue for <b>the</b> trial was agreed upon by Superior Court Judge Timothy Kincaid. Judge Kincaid said <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial would be decided on September 12, 2011.|$|R
5|$|When {{the meat}} was shriveling, flaking, and falling off, one {{anonymous}} donor gave the gallery $260 for replacement meat. (This number was of some debate, with $350 worth of meat listed in one vegetarian magazine.) Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> negative <b>publicity</b> <b>the</b> work had received, gallery staff {{pretended to be}} caterers when finding a butcher in the Ottawa area to provide replacement meat.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> sudden bout <b>of</b> fame {{was not an}} {{immediate}} blessing for de la Roche, as <b>the</b> stress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attendant <b>publicity</b> caused her to experience another breakdown in early 1928.
