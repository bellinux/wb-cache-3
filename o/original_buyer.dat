25|$|The {{land was}} sold at auction in Sydney and {{attracted}} speculators, {{many of whom}} would never see the land they purchased. Only one <b>original</b> <b>buyer,</b> James Simpson, settled on his land. Simpson subdivided his land and marked out two streets, Carmarthon Street (later Albert Street) and Landillo Street (later Victoria Street). Because the land was too marshy he left the area in 1859 {{with much of the}} land unsold.|$|E
25|$|In the Dominican Republic, {{there are}} three {{distribution}} companies. The government owns two of them, EdeNorte and EdeSur, through the CDEEE (50%) and the Fondo Patrimonial de las Empresas (FONPER). It also maintains a 50% ownership of the third one, EdeEste, (the additional 50% {{is owned by the}} Trust Company of the West (TCW) which is operated by AES Corporation, its <b>original</b> <b>buyer.</b> The three companies serve a similar share of the market.|$|E

50|$|The 45 company-owned {{homes were}} sold off in 1961 for prices up to $900. The {{residents}} named their own reeve and council {{to oversee the}} less than 200 population, which continued until its amalgamation. The last reeve of Deloro was Doug Lynch, {{who was one of}} the <b>original</b> <b>buyers</b> of the land and still lives there today.|$|R
25|$|In 1841 two friends, Thomas Wilkinson and Edward Stone Parker, bought {{land from}} one of the <b>original</b> <b>buyers.</b> Stone soon left but Wilkinson stayed on and {{subdivided}} his land for sale or rent. He marked two roads which would eventually become extensions of the roads marked out by Simpson. Wilkinson named the streets Victoria Street (after Queen Victoria) and Albert Street (after her husband Prince Albert).|$|R
25|$|The seller {{takes the}} risk that the buyer may default on the contract, depriving the seller of the {{expected}} revenue stream. More important, a seller normally limits its risk by buying offsetting protection from another party— that is, it hedges its exposure. If the <b>original</b> <b>buyer</b> drops out, the seller squares its position by either unwinding the hedge transaction or by selling a new CDS to a third party. Depending on market conditions, that may be at a lower price than the original CDS and may therefore involve a loss to the seller.|$|E
25|$|The city began {{auctioning}} {{its enormous}} portfolio of Harlem properties {{to the public}} in 1985. This was intended to improve the community by placing property in the hands of people who would live in them and maintain them. In many cases, the city would even pay to completely renovate a property before selling it (by lottery) below market value. The program was soon beset by scandal—buyers were acquiring houses from the city, then making deals with churches or other charities in which they would inflate the appraised values of the properties and the church or charity would take out federally guaranteed 203(k) mortgage and buy it. The <b>original</b> <b>buyer</b> would realize a profit and the church or charity would default on the mortgage (presumably getting some kind of kickback from the developer). Abandoned shells were left to further deteriorate, and {{about a third of the}} properties sold by the city were tenements which still had tenants, who were left in particularly miserable conditions. These properties, and new restrictions on Harlem mortgages, bedeviled the area's residential real estate market for years.|$|E
2500|$|Speculators on futures price {{fluctuations}} {{who do not}} intend to make or take ultimate delivery must take care to [...] "zero their positions" [...] prior to the contract's expiry. After expiry, each contract will be settled, either by physical delivery (typically for commodity underlyings) or by a cash settlement (typically for financial underlyings). The contracts ultimately are not between the <b>original</b> <b>buyer</b> and the original seller, but between the holders at expiry and the exchange. Because a contract may pass through many hands after it is created by its initial purchase and sale, or even be liquidated, settling parties do not know with whom they have ultimately traded.|$|E
5000|$|After he calms down, Tracey confesses {{that he is}} {{smuggling}} illegal internal organs. He {{was supposed}} to deliver the implanted organs on Ariel, but he got a higher bid. Unfortunately for him, the <b>original</b> <b>buyers</b> killed the new customer and are now after their stolen [...] "merchandise". Another shot from Womack reminds them of their immediate peril. After a brief pursuit, the Alliance ship finally catches up with them.|$|R
50|$|It was {{an attempt}} to improve the Aero A.100 by {{enlarging}} it and fitting it with a more powerful engine. However, even with 33% more power, performance was actually inferior, and the Czechoslovak Air Force was not interested in the type. Production did result, however, when 50 were ordered by Spanish Republican forces for use in the Spanish Civil War. Some of these aircraft were captured by Nationalists while en route and used against their <b>original</b> <b>buyers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The EMD Model 40 was a two-axle {{diesel-electric}} locomotive built by Electro-Motive Corporation, and its corporate successor, General Motors' Electro-Motive Division (EMD) between August 1940 and April 1943.

2500|$|A CGC 9.0-graded comic, {{with white}} pages, was {{auctioned}} {{for sale on}} eBay in August 2014. The seller Darren Adams, a comic book store owner in Federal Way, Washington, had purchased the issue from the estate {{of a man who}} had originally bought the issue from a newsstand on its release in 1938. The <b>original</b> <b>buyer</b> lived in high altitudes in West Virginia and stored the comic in a stack with others, which provided the optimal [...] "cool, dry and dark" [...] conditions that lent well to a comic's age, according to Adams. The comic changed hands twice prior to the auction; first sold as part of an estate sale when the original purchaser died forty years after its publication, and then to a third person who held the comic for about thirty years. Some years prior to the auction, Adams was contacted by this third person, and seeing the pristine condition of the comic, purchased it for a [...] "seven figure sum". He held onto the comic for a few years before deciding to sell it, keeping the existence of it otherwise a secret, even rejecting a $3 million offer to buy the comic outright. On his decision to sell, he opted to use eBay instead of other comic auction houses like Heritage House, believing the auction site would reach a wider audience and was a better fit for the pop culture nature of the piece. After discussions with the site, Adams and eBay also arranged to donate 1% of the sale to the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, reflecting on Christopher Reeve's role as Superman in motion pictures. The auction ended on August 24, 2014 and sold for over $3.2 million.|$|E
50|$|Glastonbury Festival, {{which sold}} out 137,500 tickets within {{less than two}} hours in 2007, {{introduced}} a system in the same year whereby tickets included photographic ID of the <b>original</b> <b>buyer,</b> to enforce non-exchangeability.|$|E
50|$|Judge Richard Posner has {{suggested}} that the availability of cover allows for efficient breach - that is, that it encourages the most efficient allocation of resources by allowing a seller to breach a contract to sell goods to one buyer when another, more lucrative opportunity comes along. The seller may thus be able to realize a sufficiently increased profit to make more money even after repaying the difference to the <b>original</b> <b>buyer.</b> Therefore, no value is lost in the transaction because the <b>original</b> <b>buyer</b> is in the same position he would have been in but for the breach, and the seller is in a better position.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, Maverick Helicopters {{became one}} of the <b>original</b> <b>buyers</b> of the Eurocopter EC130. In February 2005, Maverick {{acquired}} AirStar Helicopter. Later, in October 2008, Maverick Aviation Group established a fixed wing division, operating under the name Maverick Airlines. Based out of Henderson Executive Airport, the airline division offers tours of the Grand Canyon aboard Beechcraft 1900 and Cessna 208 Caravan series aircraft. Also in 2008, Maverick established Mustang Helicopters, which provides helicopter tour services from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon. On September 3, 2009, Maverick Helicopters surpassed 100,000 flight hours utilizing EC130 Helicopters.|$|R
40|$|A consumer's {{demand for}} a durable good is governed not only by his {{individual}} preferences but also by preferences of other market participants. This interdependence of preferences arises from the inevitable resale of durable goods. If most people prefer goods with certain features, <b>original</b> <b>buyers</b> conform and choose goods with these features {{even if they do}} not like them. Using a matching model, we show there is always conformity in equilibrium. The incentive to conform is strongest for long-lived durables and for people who trade frequently. If average preferences are sufficiently strong, there is always too little conformity in equilibrium. Copyright (c) 2008, RAND. ...|$|R
50|$|The Pacman Conjecture {{requires}} that the monopolist to have perfect information about consumer reservation prices and an infinite time horizon. The buyers must not only follow the get-it-while-you-can strategy, but also must faithfully believe that the monopolist is following a perfect Pacman strategy (as otherwise they would be tempted to match patience with the monopolist in hopes of getting a better deal later). The monopolist will exercise full market power over the buyers in that pool, but {{will not be able}} to extract similar surpluses from buyers who come in from outside (for example, the children of the <b>original</b> <b>buyers)</b> without deviating from the pure Pacman strategy.|$|R
50|$|If {{the seller}} now {{receives}} another (better) offer {{to purchase the}} same property, he/she can also accept this offer, as a back-up offer. The seller can then activate the escape clause by notifying the <b>original</b> <b>buyer</b> about the back-up offer.|$|E

50|$|In early 2010, Chicago art {{collector}} Jeffrey Goldstein {{acquired a}} portion of the Maier collection from Prow, one of the <b>original</b> <b>buyers.</b> Since Goldstein's <b>original</b> purchase, his collection has grown to include 17,500 negatives, 2,000 prints, 30 homemade movies, and numerous slides. In December 2014, Goldstein sold his collection of B&W negatives to Stephen Bulger Gallery, Toronto. Maloof, who runs the Maloof Collection, now owns around 90% of Maier's total output, including 100,000 to 150,000 negatives, more than 3,000 vintage prints, hundreds of rolls of film, home movies, audio tape interviews, and ephemera including cameras and paperwork, which he claims represents roughly 90 percent of her known work.|$|R

50|$|One {{can have}} a {{controlling}} interest {{in a piece of}} property even after selling it. In R v Marshall, a group of defendants resold used tickets for the London Underground. The Court of Appeal dismissed their appeal in part because the tickets said they were the property of London Underground, a condition of sale agreed to by the <b>original</b> <b>buyer</b> of the ticket.|$|E
50|$|Frequently, {{this occurs}} {{due to a}} change in circumstances, such that the seller no longer wishes to move, or are unable to. It has also been linked to a {{slowdown}} in housing market activity, which leads to an under-supply of property, giving the vendor less choice of properties to move to. The <b>original</b> <b>buyer</b> is left 'hanging'; hence the word gazanging, intended to echo the commonplace term gazumping.|$|E
5000|$|The Double House {{is a house}} {{located in}} Utrecht, Netherlands. It was {{designed}} by Bjarne Mastenbroek and Winy Maas of MVRDV in 1997. [...] The Koek Family bought {{a large piece of}} land that overlooked a beautiful park, but soon found out that they could not afford to build a house to satisfy such a great piece of land. They realized that with the joined income of two families, the house could reach its true potential, so the Koek family joined with the Wesseling family. Bjarne Mastenbroek was given the task of fitting the two families into one structure, and divide views close to equally and the <b>original</b> <b>buyers</b> would get 2/3 of the space and the new buyers would get 1/3 of the space.

5000|$|When the Asian {{financial}} crisis hit in 1997, Bangkok's {{real estate market}} collapsed, and the finance companies that had funded the project went bankrupt and were subsequently liquidated. Construction projects across the city came to a halt, and Bangkok was left with over 300 unfinished high-rise projects. Most of these buildings (State Tower among them) have since been completed as the economy recovered, but Sathorn Unique remains among Bangkok's dozen-plus unfinished [...] "ghost towers", despite multiple negotiations and refinancing efforts led by Rangsan's son Pansit Torsuwan, who had joined Rangsan's firm in 2004. This was largely due to Rangsan's insistence that the project only be sold off at a price {{that would allow the}} building's <b>original</b> <b>buyers</b> to be repaid in full, instead of declaring bankruptcy and dissolving the company.|$|R

Paul and Maureen work to earn money to buy a Chincoteague pony mare named the Phantom, who has escaped the roundup men on Pony Penning Day for the past two years. Paul and Maureen save enough to buy Phantom, and Paul is able to capture her on the roundup because she is slowed down by her new foal, Misty. However, a man from the mainland buys the pair of ponies for his son before Paul and Maureen can give their money to the fire chief. Paul and Maureen are distressed, but they end up being able to buy Phantom and Misty because the <b>original</b> <b>buyer's</b> son won a colt in the yearly raffle and then decided he didn't need three ponies.|$|R
