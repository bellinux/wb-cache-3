40|$|We {{investigated}} how {{modifications in}} winter and spring temperature conditions may affect the survival of a spring-hatching Lepidoptera, the <b>oak</b> <b>processionary</b> moth Thaumetopoea processionea. Supercooling and chilling injury experiments indicate that eggs are especially cold hardy {{at the start of}} the winter period, although this ability is reduced later in the season. In the spring, young larvae are sufficiently cold hardy to ensure no direct mortality as a result of late frosts. A comparison of phenological models shows that neonate larvae may await the unfolding of new oak leaves for relatively long periods (e. g. 1 - 30 days). Under both low (4 °C after 5 days at 16 °C) and high temperature experimental scenarios (constant 16 °C), the majority of neonate larvae can survive starvation for more than 2 weeks. Larvae may also suffer from food depletion once their development has been initiated (e. g. during cold springs) if the threshold temperature for feeding is not reached for several consecutive days, or in the case of late frosts affecting foliage availability. When temperature is reduced to 4 °C, developing larvae become inactive and do not feed anymore; their starvation survival capability is reduced to approximately 2 weeks (cold spring hypothesis). At 16 °C, developing larvae that are deprived of food can only survive for 10 days (late frost hypothesis). We conclude that, in the <b>oak</b> <b>processionary</b> moth, neonate larvae are relatively well adapted to early hatching relative to budburst, ensuring them the highest foliage quality for development. In some years, however, phenological asynchrony or cold spring conditions may affect the persistence of populations at the limits of the species' range. © 2012 The Authors.

40|$|The {{biological}} activity of synthetic (Z, Z) - 11, 13 -hexadecadienyl acetate, the major pheromone component found in female gland extracts of the <b>oak</b> <b>processionary</b> moth Thaumetopoea processionea, was evaluated in field trials. Traps baited with 10 mg {{of the chemical}} efficiently attracted {{a large number of}} males provided they were placed in the upper crown region of the oaks. Devices positioned 10 - 15 m high in the trees attracted significantly more males than those traps installed at 2 or 6 - 8 m above the ground. Pherocon traps were slightly more efficient than Delta traps, and lower or higher amounts of the attractant in the baits did not significantly influence the number of moths caught. The importance of the stereomeric purity of the lure and the easy isomerization of the (Z, Z) -acetate to other isomers, particularly to the E, E isomer, should be considered for the development of efficient formulations in the field. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The sex {{pheromone}} of the <b>oak</b> <b>processionary</b> moth Thaumetopoea processionea {{has been}} characterized from female gland extracts as a mixture of (Z,Z) - 11, 13 -hexadecadienyl acetate (1), (E,Z) - 11, 13 -hexadecadienyl acetate (3) and (Z,Z) - 1 1, 13 -hexadecadienol (2) in 88 : 7 : 5 ratio. The amount of the major compound 1 was 20 - 30 ng/gland. No trace of (ZZ) - 11, 13 -hexadecadienal {{was found in the}} extract, and therefore, T. processionea appears to be the only "summer" processionary moth lacking this compound as a pheromone compound. The alcohol 2 had also been previously found but is electrophysiologically inactive, and in wind tunnel assays it lowers the number of contacts with the source when mixed with the major compound 1. The major component 1 elicited males to display the complete behavioral sequence, but the amount of chemical needed was unexpectedly high in comparison to the activity displayed by virgin females and gland extracts. (E,E) - 11, 13 -hexadecadienyl acetate (5) inhibits the attractant activity of the major component 1 when mixed with 1 in 1 : 10 and 1 : 1 ratios. The main constituent 1 is active in the field, but its tendency to isomerize into the corresponding E,E isomer (5) must be considered if effective formulations are to be prepared. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Outbreaks of new {{invasive}} tree {{pests and}} diseases have increased over recent years, {{some of which}} present a significant risk to tree health, plant biosecurity and ecosystem functions. These outbreaks often involve complex and sometimes contradictory interactions between attempts by governments to manage them, media coverage and the diverse risk perceptions of stakeholders and publics. In this paper we draw on insights from actor-network-theory to guide our methodological approach to understanding expert and public risk concerns around three tree pest and disease outbreaks in the UK: ash dieback, <b>oak</b> <b>processionary</b> moth and Phytophthora ramorum. We argue that the 'risk' of tree pests and diseases {{does not exist in}} an objective sense that can be measured, but is constantly being produced (and reproduced) through the associations between people and nonhumans in actor-networks. Thus, tree pest and disease outbreaks can be conceptualized as part of assemblages of actors (publics, policy makers, biological organisms etc.), enactments (policy, regulation, performance etc.) and materialities (places). We draw on work currently being undertaken as part of the UK's Tree Health and Plant Biosecurity Initiative Phase 2 project UNPICK (Understanding public risk in relation to tree health) which includes exploring the personal and professional encounters that people have with pests and diseases in particular locales. We focus on the intersections and translations that occur through those encounters to understand how problems like tree diseases are constituted, risks understood and management approaches assembled...|$|E
40|$|Context: Habitat {{fragmentation}} {{is increasing}} {{as a result}} of anthropogenic activities, especially in urban areas. Dispersal through fragmented habitats is key for species to spread, persist in metapopulations and shift range in response to climate change. However, high habitat connectivity may also hasten the spread of invasive species. Objective: To develop a model of spread in fragmented landscapes and apply it to the spread of an invasive insect in urban woodland. Methods: We applied a patch-based model, based on electric network theory, to model the current and predicted future spread of <b>oak</b> <b>processionary</b> moth (OPM: Thaumetopoea processionea) from its source in west London. We compared the pattern of ‘effective distance’ from the source (i. e. the patch ‘voltage’ in the model) with the observed spread of the moth from 2006 to 2012. Results: We showed that ‘effective distance’ fitted current spread of OPM. Patches varied considerably in their ‘current’ and ‘power’ (metrics from the model), which is an indication of their importance in the future spread of OPM. Conclusions: Patches identified as ‘important’ are potential ‘pinch points’ and regions of high ‘flow’, where resources for detection and management will be most cost-effectively deployed. However, data on OPM dispersal and the distribution of oak trees limited the strength of our conclusions, so should be priorities for further data collection. This application of electric network theory can be used to inform landscape-scale conservation initiatives both to reduce the spread of invasives and to facilitate large-scale species’ range shifts in response to climate change. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Oak</b> <b>Processionary</b> Moth (OPM: Thaumetopoea processionea) is long {{established}} in mainland Europe, {{where it is}} known to cause defoliation of oaks which can significantly weaken affected trees, leaving them vulnerable to other stressors. OPM also {{poses a threat to}} public health through skin and respiratory irritation caused by the poisonous hairs on the caterpillars. Official confirmation that OPM had been found in the UK {{for the first time in}} London in 2006 marked the beginning of a long and difficult campaign to eradicate this pest from a largely urban setting. Following its continued spread, however, the outbreak was eventually judged impossible to eradicate. In 2010 a policy of containment was adopted to minimise the population, spread and impacts as much as possible. Despite this, OPM continues to pose a threat to tree and human health in London. This paper examines how OPM was managed in London and asks why eradication proved so difficult. It explores the governance and management challenges faced by those involved in the attempted eradication campaign and assesses the extent to which the specifically urban setting of the outbreak intensified these difficulties. This paper draws on documentary sources and a series of 20 semi-structured interviews conducted by the authors with experts and stakeholders involved in managing the London OPM outbreaks between 2006 and 2012. Three key challenges were identified; assigning statutory responsibility for urban trees; co-ordinating the stakeholder and landowner response in a complex urban setting; and assessing and managing combined risks to trees and people...|$|E
40|$|The Social Amplification of Risk Framework (SARF) {{is often}} used as a {{conceptual}} tool for studying diverse risk perceptions associated with environmental hazards. While widely applied, it has been criticised for implying {{that it is possible}} to define a benchmark ‘real’ risk that is determined by experts and around which public risk perceptions can subsequently become amplified. It has been argued that this objectification of risk is particularly problematic when there are high levels of scientific uncertainty and a lack of expert consensus about the nature of a risk and its impacts. In order to explore this further, this paper examines how ‘experts’ - defined in this case as scientists, policy makers, outbreak managers and key stakeholders – construct and assemble their understanding of the risks associated with two invasive tree pest and disease outbreaks in the UK, ash dieback and <b>oak</b> <b>processionary</b> moth. Through semi-structured interviews with experts in each of the case study outbreaks, the paper aims to better understand the nature of information sources drawn on to construct perceptions of tree health risks, especially when uncertainty is prevalent. A key conclusion is that risk assessment is a socially-mediated, relational and incremental process with experts drawing on a range of official, anecdotal and experiential sources of information, as well as reference to past events in order to assemble the risk case. Aligned with this, experts make attributions about public concern, especially when the evidence base is incomplete and there is a need to justify policy and management actions and safeguard reputation...|$|E
40|$|The <b>oak</b> <b>processionary</b> moth Thaumetopoea processionea (Notodontidae) is {{presently}} distributed {{in almost all}} European countries and in part of the Middle East. In the North, its range limit passes through the Netherlands and Germany, and {{the southern part of}} Poland and Ukraine. In the South, the species is present in all the countries located on the northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, in Anatolia, and in the mountains surrounding the Dead Sea Transform. Using information from museum and personal collections, the available literature and other relevant datasets, we show that the species was already largely distributed throughout Europe before 1920. The available data do not provide any evidence of any long-term latitudinal shift of the species betwen 1750 and 2010. In the northernmost part of its range, the population dynamics of the species is characterized by important fluctuations. We studied their pattern in Belgium, the Netherlands and part of Germany, after the apparent regional disappearance of the species {{during the first half of}} the 20 th Century. The data suggest a continuous extent of the apparent distribution of the insect between 1970 and 2009, at a rate of approximately 7. 5 km per year. To explain the present distribution of the species, we discuss possible improvements of environmental conditions that could have triggered local population increases and favoured dispersal to adjacent areas. In addition, human activity, including the commercial movements of infested nursery trees, was recently suspected to be another source of spread over geographical barriers. © 2011 The Authors.

40|$|Invasive alien species, {{including}} {{pests and}} diseases {{of plants and}} animals, are {{a major cause of}} biodiversity change and may impact upon human well-being and the economy. If new, potentially invasive, taxa arrive then it is most cost-effective to respond as early in their establishment as possible. Information to support this can be gained from volunteers, i. e. via citizen science. However, it is vital to develop ways of quantifying volunteer recorder effort to assess its contribution to the detection of rare events, such as the arrival of invasive alien species. We considered the potential to detect adult <b>oak</b> <b>processionary</b> moths (Thaumetopoea processionea) by amateur naturalists recording moths at light traps. We calculated detection rates from the Netherlands, where T. processionea is widely established and poses a risk to tree health and human health, and applied these to the spatial pattern of moth recording effort in the UK. The probability of recording T. processionea in the Netherlands varied across provinces from 0. 05 – 2. 4 % per species of macro-moth recorded on a list of species (so equalling 1 – 52 % for a list of 30 species). Applying these rates to the pattern of moth recording in the UK: T. processionea could be detected (detection > 0 %), if it were present, in 69 % and 4. 7 % of 10 km and 1 km squares, respectively. However, in most squares detection probability is low (10 %). Our study provides a means to objectively assess the use of citizen science as a monitoring tool in the detection of rare events, e. g. the arrival of invasive alien species, occurrence of rare species and natural colonisation...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the late}} 1990 s, the <b>oak</b> <b>processionary</b> moth, Thaumetopoea processionea (L.), has been {{occurring}} at high population densities in eastern Austria. Particularly, infestations {{in areas of}} human settlement have created increasing interest in this insect due to health problems caused by the urticating hairs of the larvae. New methods for biological control are desirable. Like essentially all forest Lepidoptera, T. processionea is host for entomopathogenic microsporidia. These obligatory parasitic protists have been evaluated as biocontrol agents against an other oak pest, Lymantria dispar (Weiser & Novotny, 1987; Jeffords & al., 1988). Life history traits of T. processionea make this insect an even more promising target {{for the use of}} microsporidia. The larvae are highly gregarious and stay together in nests made of larval silk for resting periods and molting. Microsporidia utilize several pathways for horizontal transmission that would be aided by these features: spores can be released after host death from cadavers as well as from living larvae via silk or feces. Additionally, many microsporidia are vertically transmitted (summarized in Maddox & al., 1998). In this project, T. processionea larvae from various regions in eastern Austria were screened for the natural occurrence of microsporidia. One isolate, Endoreticulatus sp., was further studied and mass produced in a laboratory host, L. dispar, that is easy to rear and does not pose a health hazard for people working with the insects. An inoculative release was attempted on isolated trees infested with T. processionea. In einem zweijährigen Screening untersuchten wir das Auftreten von Mikrosporidien bei Thaumetopoea processionea an verschiedenen Standorten in Ostösterreich. In neun von 18 Populationen wurden Mikrosporidiosen nachgewiesen, die Prävalenzen lagen zwischen 1, 9 % und 15, 4 %. Basierend auf lichtmikroskopischen Befunden waren die gefundenen Pathogene den Gattungen Endoreticulatus, Nosema, Cystosporogenes und Vairimorpha zuzuordnen. Endoreticulatus sp. vermochte im Labor Raupen von Lymantria dispar zu infizieren. Das erlaubte die einfache Produktion von Inokulum sowie Untersuchungen mit einem ungefährlichen Wirtsinsekt. Laborversuche mit L. dispar zeigten einen langsamen Krankheitsverlauf, der aber in signifikant erhöhter Mortalität resultierte (nur 26 % der oral inokulierten Tiere entwickelten sich zu Imagines), sowie eine effiziente horizontale Übertragung. Eine inokulative Freilassung wurde versucht: dazu wurden Endoreticulatus-Sporen in wässriger Suspension auf Blätter isoliert stehender, von T. processionea befallenen Eichen ausgebracht. Die Inokulation war erfolgreich, allerdings auf niedrigem Niveau – die maximale Infektionsrate lag bei 9, 5 %...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Plant Health was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on a pest risk analysis for Thaumetopoea processionea L. prepared by the UK. The Panel was also asked to consider in its opinion the plant health risk of T. processionea to the whole EU territory. The <b>oak</b> <b>processionary</b> moth, Thaumetopoea processionea, is established in Europe and feeds primarily on deciduous oak (Quercus) species. The insect has one generation per year and overwinters as eggs laid on branches of oak trees. After emergence, the larvae feed gregariously and from the 5 th instar form a communal silken nest on the tree from which they typically migrate in procession to feed. Feeding may result in partial or complete tree defoliation. From the third instar, the larvae produce urticating hairs which may cause allergic reactions in humans and animals. The Panel examined in detail the UK document {{to determine whether the}} evidence presented in the document supports the conclusions reached for the assessment area of the UK, including Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands. To consider the risks posed to the whole area of the European Community, the Panel analysed additional information obtained from {{a review of the literature}} and from consultation with experts in the EU. The Panel conducted a preliminary climatic analysis to explore the establishment in the whole EU area, based on temperature accumulation. Based on the above, the Panel reaches the following conclusions: 1. With regard to the evaluation of the UK document:•the Panel agrees that the probability for entry on the plants for planting pathway is moderate to high. It further agrees that the probability of entry of T. processionea on the oak roundwood pathway is low;•the Panel agrees that the probability of establishment of T. processionea in the southern area of the UK is high given the presence of breeding populations in London and Jersey, the widespread distribution of oak trees and the favourable climatic conditions in the southern part of the assessment area;•in the UK document evidence is not presented to support the statement that the impact of the <b>oak</b> <b>processionary</b> moth on oak trees is major. Pest management measures applied in areas where the pest is established relate primarily to human health effects and thus are not considered to be a reliable indicator of the magnitude of plant health impact of T. processionea;•the Panel concludes from an evaluation of the risk assessment provided for the assessment area of the UK and review of additional information, that T. processionea may enter, establish and spread in the UK and has the potential to cause negative effects on the health of Quercus spp. although there is a high level of uncertainty relating to the magnitude of the effects on wood yield and quality which are directly attributed to T. processionea;•for the plants for planting pathway, visual inspection, pest surveillance and the establishment of pest free areas or places of production are proposed as risk management options in the UK document. The Panel agrees that uncertainties relating to adult dispersal and the absence of tested surveillance methods may influence the effectiveness and practical implementation of the management options proposed. Further analysis on natural dispersal by flight would assist in evaluation of entry pathways and risk management measures, including those taken in the area of the UK where the pest is present and under official control;•the Panel agrees that the management options proposed for the roundwood pathway can reduce the risk of introduction i. e. removal of bark, restriction of time of year of felling and export of roundwood. There are uncertainties regarding the effectiveness of visual inspection for the presence of nests and the practicality of bark removal for oaks. 2. With regard to the risk assessment conducted for the whole EU territory:•T. processionea occurs in many Member States of the EU territory, but the Panel found no reports to suggest that the pest is established in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta or Sweden;•the presence of the pest in many areas of the EU territory provides opportunity for natural dispersal of T. processionea into adjacent areas where it is not currently established. Natural dispersal of adults may be restricted by geographic barriers (e. g. sea, mountains);•the results from the exploratory analysis conducted by the Panel indicate that spring and summer temperatures are suitable for larval and pupal development in parts of all EU member states where the pest is currently absent. Overwintering survival is not considered to be a key factor in defining the northern limits to the distribution. Limited availability of host plants (Quercus spp.) and low summer temperatures are likely to restrict the potential area of establishment to southern areas of the most northern EU member states;•reports of the plant health impact of T. processionea range from low to high. Due to the high level of variation in the level of plant health impact in the pest’s current area of distribution, more detailed analysis is required to assess the consequences of further spread in areas where it is not currently established in the EU;•the Panel considers that the degree of uncertainty is high. The main uncertainties relate to:■differences in the magnitude of the pest effects reported from different areas of the EU where the pest is established,■the plant health impact directly attributed to T. processionea alone and in combination with other stress factors contributing to tree mortality,■factors affecting the health status and susceptibility of Quercus spp. to defoliation by T. processionea,■the current distribution of T. processionea in the EU territory and lack of biological data needed to estimate the potential expansion of the range of T. processionea,■natural dispersal capabilities of T. processionea females and effectiveness of surveillance methods. Phytosanitary measures are unlikely to prevent natural dispersal of the pest. Phytosanitary measures aimed at plants for planting could, however, reduce the probability of introduction of the pest into areas of the EU territory where the pest is currently absent, or present but under official control. Therefore, the Panel concludes that T. processionea may be considered as a harmful organism and hence is potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Council Directive 2000 / 29 /E...|$|E
40|$|Changes in ecology, {{climate and}} human {{behaviour}} over recent decades have favoured {{the development and}} increased prevalence of urban pests, including nuisance insects. The potential for nuisance insect species to increase in prevalence in the UK {{as a result of}} climate change is addressed in this report through two key objectives: 1 : To complete a desk top study to determine the current level of knowledge in relation to new and existing species of insect with the potential to cause statutory nuisance in the UK as a result of current and predicted climate change 2 : To investigate the potential for new and existing species of insect to cause statutory nuisance to occur in the UK as a result of current and predicted climate change In the first section of this report we consider the first objective and present an inventory of nuisance insects and discuss the availability of information on these species to Environmental Health Officers (EHOs). We conclude from this section that defining an insect as a statutory nuisance should be on a case-by-case basis; an insect will be a statutory nuisance in some scenarios but not others (particularly in relation to the source and abundance of the insects). In addition, we focus on two subsidiary objectives: 3. To devise a programme or technique for monitoring trends in the insects of most concern 4 To devise a list of strategies that Environmental Health Officers can apply locally and disseminate to residents. We comment on the wealth of literature and information on nuisance insect species but note the lack of a central information source for EHOs and other interested parties. We suggest that a central repository would be a valuable tool for EHO‟s particularly if it included fact sheets (providing relevant biological information for EHO‟s) and distribution maps. We advocate the use of the National Biodiversity Network (NBN) Gateway as a resource for providing distribution data but discuss the current limitations in terms of available data. We have appended example fact sheets for a number of species. In the second section of this report we consider nuisance insects more broadly than encompassed in the statutory nuisance definition, and provide examples of species that have 6 already been recorded in Britain (native and non-native including residents and occasional immigrants) or are potential invaders (non-native new arrivals). The methods used to review the literature on nuisance insects species and the impacts of climate change on their distribution, in a systematic way, are described. We highlight the nuisance insect species that are unlikely to be affected by climate warming Blattella germanica (german cockroach), Cimex lectularius (bed bug), Monomorium pharaonis (Pharaoh‟s ant), Anobium punctatum (woodworm), Ctenocephalides felis (cat fleas), Lyctus brunneus (powderpost beetle), Hylotrupes bajulus (house longhorn), Tineola bisselliella (common clothes moth), Dolichovespula media (media wasp) and Vespa crabro (European hornet). The ten species most likely to increase with climate warming are Tinearia alternata (moth fly), Lasius neglectus (invasive garden ant), Thaumetopoea processionea (<b>oak</b> <b>processionary</b> moth), Linepithema humile (Argentine ant), Reticulitermes grassei (Mediterranean termite), Culex pipiens molestus (urban mosquito), Culex pipiens pipiens (mosquito), Aedes vexans (mosquito – wetland), Ochlerotatus cantans (mosquito – woodland) and Musca domestica (house fly). The ten species most likely to increase with changes in precipitation are the same as for increasing temperature with the exception of Musca domestica and inclusion of Phlebotomus mascittii (sand fly). We provide two detailed case studies illustrating potential modelling approaches: biting midges and mosquitoes. In addition, we highlight the potential for further studies which would enable detailed quantitative analysis, such as demonstrated in the case studies, to be undertaken across taxa...|$|E
