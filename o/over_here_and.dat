500|$|The 11Group Operations Room was {{extensively}} {{surveyed in}} order for a replica to be built at Pinewood Studios for the 1969 film Battle of Britain. Scenes for the 1996 television miniseries <b>Over</b> <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> an episode of Richard Holmes' War Walks were filmed in the Operations Room itself. The reinforced Uniter building was built on the site in the 1970s to house communications equipment. Although no longer used for this purpose, the building contains two fuel storage tanks. The main entrance to the station was moved in 1972 from beside the station cinema to its present location roughly [...] south.|$|E
500|$|In a May 8, 2008 {{report on}} the recent actions of Anonymous against Scientology, CNN {{reporter}} Kareen Wynter commented: [...] "Legal experts say the church may be facing its biggest challenge yet – trying to protect its image, in a loosely policed medium seen by millions of people. In a July 2008 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Alan Moore {{had this to say}} about the use of the Guy Fawkes motif, adopted from his comic V for Vendetta: [...] "I was also quite heartened the other day when watching the news to see that there were demonstrations outside the Scientology headquarters <b>over</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> that they suddenly flashed to a clip showing all these demonstrators wearing V for Vendetta [...] masks. That pleased me. That gave me a warm little glow." ...|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{stepped outside}} and quietly remarked, [...] "We spend $75 {{billion a year}} on armaments and $3 {{billion a year on}} dogs. We have to do more for these {{children}} that didn't ask to be born into this." [...] Local newspaper editor Cliff Langford, who strongly disliked Kennedy, shouted back that the two senators were being brainwashed. Clark retorted, [...] "Don't worry. We've been brainwashed from the other side." [...] Langford added, [...] "I don't know of anybody starving down here." [...] Kennedy responded, [...] "Step <b>over</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> I'll introduce you to some." [...] Clark reassured the reporters that he and Kennedy were not observing conditions in the Delta to [...] "find fault," [...] but rather [...] "just {{to see if we can}} do anything about it." ...|$|E

500|$|Following a mid-year {{tour of the}} United States, the American Federation of Musicians refused {{permits for}} the group to appear in concerts there {{for the next four}} years, {{effectively}} cutting off the Kinks from the main market for rock music {{at the height of the}} British Invasion. [...] Although neither the Kinks nor the union gave a specific reason for the ban, at the time it was widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour. It has been reported that an incident when the band were taping Dick Clark's TV show Where The Action Is in 1965 led to the ban. Ray Davies recalls in his autobiography, [...] "Some guy who said he worked for the TV company walked up and accused us of being late. Then he started making anti-British comments. Things like 'Just because the Beatles did it, every mop-topped, spotty-faced limey juvenile thinks he can come <b>over</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> make a career for himself." [...] following which a punch was thrown and the AFM banned them.|$|E
500|$|Egan {{joked that}} {{although}} [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] was [...] "fun" [...] to perform, she felt much more [...] "white" [...] than usual recording alongside the five singers {{cast as the}} Muses, who provide the song's back up vocals. Familiar with singers Cheryl Freeman, Lillias White, Vaneese Y. Thomas, LaChanze and Roz Ryan's Broadway work, Egan felt intimated by their powerful voices and riffing abilities. Egan recalled, [...] "Alan would say, 'Okay Lillias (White), just do a riff over there and LaChanze, you do a little something <b>over</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> Susan, just at the end, get from this note to this note and just do a riff.' I raise my hand and I'm like, 'Umm, can you plunk {{it out on the}} piano?' He looks at me like, 'Are you kidding?'" [...] While it took Egan half an hour to solidify only one of her riffs, the other singers recorded multiple takes of theirs within that same time; Egan was greatly humbled by the experience. On the film's soundtrack, only Egan and Freeman are credited as vocalists on the track. Menken also produced the song. Danny Troob arranged the song while Michael Kosarin conducted the orchestration.|$|E
500|$|Many critics praised Eklund and his character, {{with one}} calling Milo [...] "spindly, intense, and nicely chilling". In a January 2011 article, The Futon Critic rated [...] "The Plateau" [...] the twenty-first best {{television}} episode of 2010 {{out of a}} list of fifty. The A.V. Club ranked Fringe the 15th best show of 2010, in particular citing [...] "The Plateau" [...] as a justification. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "The Plateau" [...] the thirteenth best episode of the series, explaining [...] "The first half of Fringes celebrated third season alternated between episodes set in the <b>over</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> over there worlds. In a tough call, we say {{the best of the}} over there stand-alones was this brainy thriller about a dude with a low I.Q. who got an intelligence boost via nootopic drugs, and found himself becoming smarter and smarter, and more and more humanly detached, and causing chaos and death by concocting intricate chain reaction events." [...] In a similar list, Den of Geek named it the eighth best episode of the series, explaining that [...] "The Plateau" [...] stood out as [...] "the best of a good crop of episodes" [...] among the parallel universe storylines because of its villain and its use of Lincoln Lee, Charlie, and Olivia in action." ...|$|E

2500|$|On May 2, 2010, Mullah Adahdad was {{attacked}} with a grenade and fatally shot, by Gibbs, Morlock, and Spc. Adam Winfield. Three days after Adahdad was murdered, {{members of a}} Stryker platoon returned to his village. Tribal elders had complained to Army officers that the cleric had been unarmed and that the shooting was a setup. [...] "This guy was shot because he took an aggressive action against coalition forces," [...] Lt. Stefan Moye, the platoon leader, explained to village residents in Qualaday. [...] "We didn’t just [...] come <b>over</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> just shoot him randomly. And we don’t do that." [...] This conversation was recorded by embedded photojournalist Max Becherer.|$|E
2500|$|Solicitor H.G. Bailey {{reminded}} {{the jury that}} the law presumed Patterson innocent, even if what Gilley and Price had described was [...] "as sordid as ever a human tongue has uttered." [...] Finally he defended the women, [...] "Instead of painting their faces ... they were brave {{enough to go to}} Chattanooga and look for honest work." [...] Bailey attacked the defense case.They say this is a frame-up! They have been yelling frame-up ever since this case started! Who framed them? Did Ory Dobbins frame them? Did brother Hill frame them? We did a lot of awful things over there is Scottsboro, didn't we? My, my, my.

2500|$|Before I {{came to this}} country, and in all {{the time}} I have been here, it has never {{occurred}} to me to think of New York as being beautiful. [...] Therefore all this talk of beautifying New York seems strange to me. If we were discussing Bismarck I might ask five hundred questions about him before I should think of asking whether he was beautiful. ... So it is with New York. We expect of her power and magnificence, but not beauty. If a European came <b>over</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> found that New York was beautiful {{in the same way as}} the European cities he knew he would be very much disappointed. I do not see how you can make New York beautiful in that way with the laws and the democratic spirit that you have here [...] The kind of beauty that makes Paris charming can only exist when private rights and personal liberty are or have been trampled on. [...] Only when the mob rules, or where kings rule, so that there is at one time absolutely no respect for the property of the rich and at another time for the rights of the poor can the beauties of Paris be realized.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2011, {{seventeen}} plaintiffs {{filed a lawsuit against}} Rutherford County, alleging that it had violated Tennessee's open-meetings law. Their attorney said that the approval of the mosque violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights, on the grounds that [...] "mosque members were compelled by their religion to subdue non-Muslims." [...] This was rejected by Chancellor Corlew, leaving the question of whether there had been sufficient public notice for the planning commission's meeting of May 24, 2010 as the only remaining issue to be decided. The plaintiffs' attorney repeatedly tried to expand the case, for instance, comparing the mosque unfavorably to a neighboring Baptist church: [...] "Are you aware of any information linking Grace Baptist Church to organizations that call for the killing of Americans?" [...] Because the Islamic Center was not named as a defendant, its members were unable to defend themselves in court against such accusations. If the case went against them, they would be forced to seek fresh approval in a climate that had become intensely hostile towards them. Saleh Sbenaty, a Syrian-born spokesman for the ICM, called the attacks [...] "draining" [...] and said that he had [...] "left my country over 30 years ago to get my freedom <b>over</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> now that's being threatened. My First Amendment rights are under fire." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 11 July 2017, Eddie Hearn {{traveled}} to the United States {{to apply for a}} Nevada boxing license for promoting and to also scout potential locations in Las Vegas speaking to MGM. He had a tour of the T-Mobile Arena. Although Nigeria, Dubai and China were discussed, Hearn warmed up to the idea of the fight taking place in Las Vegas. Hearn told Sky Sports, [...] "We met with Richard Sturm and the team at MGM in Las Vegas yesterday and had a full tour of the T-Mobile Arena which is very impressive. There is a huge appetite from both sides to hold the rematch there and we will be talking further over the next week or so to see if that can become a reality." [...] Showtime's Stephen Espinoza said a deal could be reached quickly, as he was also eager to get Joshua, who has a contract with Showtime, to fight in USA, [...] "It's no secret we've been salivating about getting him <b>over</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> certainly that would be a phenomenal fight. It would be the biggest heavyweight Vegas fight in probably a couple of decades, so we would love to host it." [...] On 25 July, Hearn pencilled in 11 November 2017 for the rematch to take place at the T-Mobile Arena. It was reported the fight could be pay-per-view in USA.|$|E
