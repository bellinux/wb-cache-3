5|$|The {{instruments}} used {{in musical}} entertainment are either solely the human voice (2, 6) or solely instrumental (1, 3) {{or some combination}} of the two (4, 5, 7, 8). Whether the performance is given by vocalists or instrumentalists, the performers may be soloists or part of a small or large group, in turn entertaining an audience that might be individual (10), passing by (3), small (1, 2) or large (6, 7, 8, 9). Singing is generally accompanied by instruments although some forms, notably a cappella and <b>overtone</b> singing, are unaccompanied. Modern concerts often use various special effects and other theatrics to accompany performances of singing and dancing (7).|$|E
5|$|In Cuvier's {{landmark}} 1796 {{paper on}} living and fossil elephants, {{he referred to}} a single catastrophe that destroyed life {{to be replaced by}} the current forms. As a result of his studies of extinct mammals, he realized that animals such as Palaeotherium had lived before the time of the mammoths, which led him to write in terms of multiple geological catastrophes that had wiped out a series of successive faunas. By 1830, a scientific consensus had formed around his ideas as a result of paleobotany and the dinosaur and marine reptile discoveries in Britain. In Great Britain, where natural theology was very influential in the early 19th century, a group of geologists that included Buckland, and Robert Jameson insisted on explicitly linking the most recent of Cuvier's catastrophes to the biblical flood. Catastrophism had a religious <b>overtone</b> in Britain that was absent elsewhere.|$|E

5000|$|These {{frequencies}} {{can either}} be [...] "harmonic", meaning they are whole number multiples of the signal's original frequencies, or [...] "inharmonic", meaning dissonant odd-order <b>overtones.</b> Harmonic distortion produces harmonically related <b>overtones</b> while intermodulation distortion produces inharmonic <b>overtones.</b> [...] "Soft clipping" [...] gradually flattens the peaks of a signal and de-emphasizes higher odd harmonics. [...] "Hard clipping" [...] flattens peaks abruptly, resulting in harsh-sounding, high amplitude odd harmonics.|$|R
40|$|Using the Frobenius method, we find high <b>overtones</b> of Dirac {{perturbations}} of the Schwarzschild {{black hole}} quasinormal spectrum. It is shown that at high <b>overtones</b> the quasinormal behavior {{is quite different}} from that for fields of integer spin. In particular, for Dirac perturbations the spacing for imaginary part of ω_n approach an equidistant regime Im ω_n+ 1 -Im ω_n =i/ 8 M, where M is the mass of the black hole. At higher <b>overtones</b> the real part of ω goes to zero. In addition, at lower <b>overtones,</b> we have found "specific modes" which have the imaginary part equal to i/ 8 M for any multipole number. These modes are apparently "algebraically special" modes. The values for lower <b>overtones</b> found by Frobenius technique are in excellent agreement with those obtained through the WKB formula...|$|R

25|$|Jill Purce (born 1947) is a British voice teacher, Family Constellations therapist, and author. Purce {{developed}} in the 1970s {{a new way of}} working with the voice, introducing the teaching worldwide of group <b>overtone</b> chanting, producing a single note whilst amplifying the vocal harmonics. She is a former fellow of King's College London, Biophysics Department. She produced over 30 books as General Editor of the Thames and Hudson Art and Imagination series. Between 1971 and 1974 she worked in Germany with the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen. Since the early 1970s she has taught internationally diverse forms of contemplative chant, and especially <b>overtone</b> chanting. For over fifteen years she has been leading Family Constellations combined with chant.|$|E

5000|$|String {{instruments}} {{can also}} produce multiphonic tones when strings are divided in two pieces or {{the sound is}} somehow distorted. The Sitar has sympathetic strings which help {{to bring out the}} <b>overtones</b> while one is playing. The <b>overtones</b> are also highly important in the tanpura, the drone instrument in traditional North and South Indian music, in which loose strings tuned at octaves and fifths are plucked and designed to buzz to create sympathetic resonance and highlight the cascading sound of the <b>overtones.</b> Western string instruments, such as the violin, may be played close to the bridge (a technique called [...] "sul ponticello" [...] or [...] "am steg") which causes the note to split into <b>overtones</b> while attaining a distinctive glassy, metallic sound. Various techniques of bow pressure may also be used to bring out the <b>overtones,</b> as well as using string nodes to produce natural harmonics. The most well-known technique on a guitar is playing flageolet tones or using distortion effects. The Ancient Chinese instrument the Guqin contains a scale based on the knotted positions of <b>overtones.</b> Also the Vietnamese Đàn bầu functions on flageolet tones. Other multiphonic extended techniques used are prepared piano, prepared guitar and 3rd bridge.|$|R

25|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} important or fundamental IR bands arise from the excitations of normal modes, the simplest distortions of the molecule, from the ground state with vibrational quantum number v = 0 to the first excited state with vibrational quantum number v = 1. In some cases, <b>overtone</b> bands are observed. An <b>overtone</b> band arises from the absorption of a photon leading to a direct transition from the ground state to the second excited vibrational state (v = 2). Such a band appears at approximately twice {{the energy of the}} fundamental band for the same normal mode. Some excitations, so-called combination modes, involve simultaneous excitation of more than one normal mode. The phenomenon of Fermi resonance can arise when two modes are similar in energy; Fermi resonance results in an unexpected shift in energy and intensity of the bands etc.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, Purce {{was invited}} to work with nuns and monks {{in a number of}} {{enclosed}} Christian Monastic Communities who sing Gregorian chant, particularly Burnham Abbey and Fairacres, Oxford, to teach <b>overtone</b> chanting and other methods to explore ways to re-invigorate and rediscover the contemplative aspects of chant in Christian traditions.|$|E
25|$|Overtones {{that are}} perfect integer {{multiples}} {{of the fundamental}} are called harmonics. When an <b>overtone</b> is near to being harmonic, but not exact, it is sometimes called a harmonic partial, although they are often referred to simply as harmonics. Sometimes overtones are created that are not anywhere near a harmonic, and are just called partials or inharmonic overtones.|$|E
25|$|The {{diatonic}} scale appears in writing throughout history, consisting of seven tones in each octave. In just intonation the {{diatonic scale}} may be easily constructed using the three simplest intervals within the octave, the perfect fifth (3/2), perfect fourth (4/3), {{and the major}} third (5/4). As forms of the fifth and third are naturally present in the <b>overtone</b> series of harmonic resonators, {{this is a very}} simple process.|$|E
50|$|However, {{for high}} <b>overtones</b> with short {{wavelengths}} that approach {{the diameter of}} the string, the string behaves more like a thick metal bar: its mechanical resistance to bending becomes an additional force to the tension, which 'raises the pitch' of the <b>overtones.</b> Only when the bending force is much smaller than the tension of the string, are its wave-speed (and the <b>overtones</b> pitched as harmonics) unchanged. The frequency-raised <b>overtones</b> (above the harmonics), called 'partials' can produce an unpleasant effect called inharmonicity. Basic strategies to reduce inharmonicity include decreasing the thickness of the string or increasing its length, choosing a flexible material with a low bending force, and increasing the tension force so that it stays much bigger than the bending force.|$|R
5000|$|However, some <b>overtones</b> in some {{instruments}} {{may not be}} of a close integer multiplication of {{the fundamental}} frequency, thus causing a small dissonance. [...] "High quality" [...] instruments are usually built {{in such a manner}} that their individual notes do not create disharmonious <b>overtones.</b> In fact, the flared end of a brass instrument is not to make the instrument sound louder, but to correct for tube length “end effects” that would otherwise make the <b>overtones</b> significantly different from integer harmonics. This is illustrated by the following: ...|$|R
