2500|$|The {{processes}} of life {{result in a}} mixture of chemicals that are not in chemical equilibrium but there are also abiotic disequilibrium processes that need to be considered. The most robust atmospheric biosignature is often considered to be molecular oxygen (...) and its photochemical byproduct ozone (...) [...] The photolysis of water (...) by UV rays followed by hydrodynamic escape of hydrogen can lead to a build-up of oxygen in planets close to their star undergoing runaway greenhouse effect. For planets in the habitable zone, it was thought that water photolysis would be strongly limited by cold-trapping of water vapour in the lower atmosphere. However, the extent of H2O cold-trapping depends strongly on the amount of non-condensible gases in the atmosphere such as nitrogen N2 and argon. In the absence of such gases, the likelihood of build-up of oxygen also depends in complex ways on the planet's accretion history, internal chemistry, atmospheric dynamics, and <b>orbital</b> <b>state.</b> Therefore, oxygen, on its own, cannot be considered a robust biosignature. The ratio of nitrogen and argon to oxygen could be detected by studying thermal phase curves or by transit transmission spectroscopy measurement of the spectral Rayleigh scattering slope in a clear-sky (i.e. aerosol-free) atmosphere.|$|E

The spin-orbital superexchange interaction between $d^ 1 (t_{ 2 g}) $ ions in cubic crystal suffers from a pathological degeneracy of <b>orbital</b> <b>states</b> at classical level.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{study the}} relaxation of electron <b>orbital</b> <b>states</b> {{of a double}} quantum dot system due to two-phonon processes. In particular, we calculate how the relaxation rates depend on the separation distance between the quantum dots, the strength of quantum dot confinement, and the lattice temperature. Enhancement of the rates by specific inter-dot distances and lattice temperatures, and the relative strength of different scattering channels are discussed. Our results show that although at low temperatures (T ∼ 1 K) two-phonon processes are almost four orders of magnitude weaker compared to one-phonon processes in relaxing electron <b>orbital</b> <b>states,</b> at room temperature they {{are as important as}} one-phonon processes.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the interplay between {{localized}} and dispersive <b>orbital</b> <b>states</b> {{in a system of}} ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, we investigate the possibility to coherently couple the lowest two Bloch bands by means of resonant periodic forcing. Considering bosons in one dimension, it is shown that a strongly interacting Floquet system can be realized, where at every lattice site two (and only two) near-degenerate <b>orbital</b> <b>states</b> are relevant. By smoothly tuning both states into resonance we find that the system can undergo an orbital-driven Mott-insulator-to-superfluid transition. As an intriguing consequence of the kinetic frustration in the system, this transition can be either continuous or first-order, depending on parameters such as lattice depth and filling.

50|$|The {{state of}} an {{orbiting}} body {{at any given}} time is defined by the orbiting body's position and velocity with respect to the central body, which can be represented by the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates (position of the orbiting body represented by x, y, and z) and the similar Cartesian components of the orbiting body's velocity. This set of six variables, together with time, are called the <b>orbital</b> <b>state</b> vectors. Given the masses of the two bodies they determine the full orbit. The two most general cases with these 6 degrees of freedom are the elliptic and the hyperbolic orbit. Special cases with fewer degrees of freedom are the circular and parabolic orbit.|$|E
50|$|Possible {{mechanisms}} for superconductivity in the cuprates {{are still the}} subject of considerable debate and further research. Certain aspects common to all materials have been identified. Similarities between the antiferromagnetic low-temperature state of the undoped materials and the superconducting state that emerges upon doping, primarily the dx2-y2 <b>orbital</b> <b>state</b> of the Cu2+ ions, suggest that electron-electron interactions are more significant than electron-phonon interactions in cuprates - making the superconductivity unconventional. Recent work on the Fermi surface has shown that nesting occurs at four points in the antiferromagnetic Brillouin zone where spin waves exist and that the superconducting energy gap is larger at these points. The weak isotope effects observed for most cuprates contrast with conventional superconductors that are well described by BCS theory.|$|E
50|$|Because the centaurs are not {{protected}} by orbital resonances, their orbits are unstable within a timescale of 106 - 107 years. For example, 55576 Amycus {{is in an}} unstable orbit near the 3:4 resonance of Uranus. Dynamical studies of their orbits indicate that being a centaur is probably an intermediate <b>orbital</b> <b>state</b> of objects transitioning from the Kuiper belt to the Jupiter family of short-period comets. Objects may be perturbed from the Kuiper belt, whereupon they become Neptune-crossing and interact gravitationally with that planet (see theories of origin). They then become classed as centaurs, but their orbits are chaotic, evolving relatively rapidly as the centaur makes repeated close approaches {{to one or more}} of the outer planets. Some centaurs will evolve into Jupiter-crossing orbits whereupon their perihelia may become reduced into the inner Solar System and they may be reclassified as active comets in the Jupiter family if they display cometary activity. Centaurs will thus ultimately collide with the Sun or a planet or else they may be ejected into interstellar space after a close approach to one of the planets, particularly Jupiter.|$|E
