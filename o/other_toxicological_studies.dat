40|$|Normal human {{epidermal}} keratinocyes (NHEK) show multiple dose-related biochemical {{changes at}} 3 hours after in vitro {{exposure to a}} vesicant compound, 2 -chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES). CEES in ethanol was diluted to 0. 8, 8. 0 and 80 mM concentrations in cell culture medium over confluent NHEK on gel-coated membranes of Millipore Millicells " or in NHEK suspensions. A site-specific fluorescent dye was incubated with each NHEK layer for 1 hr prior to comparisons of normal and challenged NHEK within a CytofluorR 2300 spectrofluorometer. Reduced fluorescence from loss of all dye probes indicated severe membrane damage with 80 mM CEES in medium. Intracellular increases in Ca-, evidence of altered mitochondrial activity, and decreases in pH, glutathione levels and lysosomal integrity, were observed with 0. 8 and 8. 0 mM CEES in the culture medium. Control studies performed with TestskinR and another human epidermal model suggest that dermal substitutes and transportation stresses can influence results with the dye probe/Cytofluor 2300 method. However, the feasibility of using the described methods to observe vesicant biochemical effects, screen antivesicants and perform <b>other</b> <b>toxicological</b> <b>studies</b> with NHEK models {{is supported by the}} results of the preliminary studies...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{a novel approach}} that may {{shed light on the}} genomic DNA methylation of organisms with non-resolved genomes. The LUminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA) is permissive for genomic DNA methylation studies of any genome as it relies on the use of methyl-sensitive and -insensitive restriction enzymes followed by polymerase extension via Pyrosequencing technology. Here, LUMA was used to characterize genomic DNA methylation in the lower brain stem region from 47 polar bears subsistence hunted in central East Greenland between 1999 and 2001. In these samples, average genomic DNA methylation was 57. 9 %[*]±[*] 6. 69 (SD; range was 42. 0 to 72. 4 %). When genomic DNA methylation was related to brain mercury (Hg) exposure levels, an inverse association was seen between these two variables for the entire study population (P for trend[*]=[*] 0. 17). After dichotomizing animals by gender and controlling for age, a negative trend was seen amongst male animals (P for trend[*]=[*] 0. 07) but no associations were found in female bears. Such sexually dimorphic responses have been found in <b>other</b> <b>toxicological</b> <b>studies.</b> Our results show that genomic DNA methylation can be quantitatively studied in a highly reproducible manner in tissue samples from a wild organism with a non-resolved genome. As such, LUMA holds great promise as a novel method to explore consequential questions across the ecological sciences that may require an epigenetic understanding...|$|E
40|$|Xenoestrogens are compounds, foreign {{from the}} body, that can enter cells and {{interact}} with the estrogen receptors (ER) to produce an estrogenic response. Many additives used in plastics are compounds with estrogenic activity. Some of these additives are known to slowly leach from the plastics. When using plastic containers as lunchboxes for reheating or food storage, these additives can leach from the plastics and {{end up in the}} food. In this project, food simulates were cooked in six different thermoplastic containers, made of polypropylene, in an oven at 100 °C for 15 minutes. Three of the thermoplastic containers were lunchboxes marketed to be able to withstand cooking in a microwave. The other three were provisional lunchboxes made from various food storing containers originally made for refrigeration purposes. The estrogenic activity in the different samples was measured using an ER-CALUX in vitro assay. The results were measured in 17 β-estradiol equivalent (Bio-EEQ) values in pg/ml. The purpose of this project was to investigate whether or not these plastic containers leach xenoestrogens that can be measured with an ER-CALUX assay, and compare the results with the results from other existing toxicological studies, and also {{to see if there is}} a difference in Bio-EEQ levels between the plastic containers made for microwave usage and those made for refrigerated purposes. The results from this project indicate that most of these plastic containers do leach estrogenic compounds that can be detected in the ER-CALUX, even the ones made for microwave usage. Fortunately, compared to <b>other</b> <b>toxicological</b> <b>studies,</b> the Bio-EEQ levels in these food samples cooked in plastic containers are low. However the potential adverse effects in prenatally exposed children cannot be ignored as other studies have shown that very low levels of xenoestrogens are enough to potentially cause a disturbance in the reproductive development and fertility...|$|E
40|$|Medicinal {{plants are}} an {{essential}} part of indigenous pharmaceutical systems. We studied the medicinal plants used by the Popoluca of the Sierra Santa Marta (Eastern Mexico). This study is part of a series on the ethnopharmacology of various Macro-Mayan groups. During 16 months of ethnobotanical fieldwork, 614 taxa used medicinally and 4488 individual use-reports were documented. The data are analysed using the concept of the "healers' consensus" in order to identify culturally important medicinal plants. The medicinal uses of the plants were grouped into 13 illness categories. The responses for each species were summarized for each of the categories and were ordered by frequency of mention. The most frequently recorded medicinal plants of the Popoluca are Hamelia patens, used to stop bleeding from wounds, and Byrsonima crassifolia, used against diarrhoea. The high-ranked medicinal species were assessed pharmacognostically using published phytochemical and pharmacological data. Popoluca medicinal uses were fairly consistent with published data on active ingredients for those plants for which such data exist. However, data is still lacking for many <b>other</b> species. <b>Toxicological</b> <b>studies</b> are particularly scarse.

40|$|Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) {{are common}} {{congenital}} abnormalities {{which have been}} reported to be associated with maternal fever and various environmental factors. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effect of prenatal exposure to cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors on heart defects. A retrospective statistical analysis was performed using data collected in our laboratory during various teratological studies carried out on albino CRL:(WI) WUBR Wistar strain rats from 1997 to 2004. The observations were compared with concurrent and historic control data, as well as findings from <b>other</b> developmental <b>toxicological</b> <b>studies</b> with selective and nonselective COX- 2 inhibitors. Despite the lack of significant differences in the frequency of VSDs between drug-exposed and control groups, statistical analysis by the two-sided Mantel-Haenszel test and historical control data showed a higher incidence of heart defects in offspring exposed to nonselective COX inhibitors (30. 06 / 10, 000). Unlike other specific inhibitors, aspirin (46. 26 / 10, 000) and ibuprofen (106. 95 / 10, 000) significantly increased the incidence of the VSD when compared with various control groups (5. 38 - 19. 72 / 10, 000). No significant differences in length or weight were detected between fetuses exposed to COX inhibitors and born with VSD and non-malformed offsprings. However, a statistically significant increase of fetal body length and decrease of body mass index were found in fetuses exposed to COX inhibitors when compared with untreated control. We conclude that prenatal exposure to COX inhibitors, especially aspirin and ibuprofen, increased the incidence of VSDs in rat offspring but was not related to fetal growth retardation...|$|R

40|$|The {{comet assay}} {{is widely used}} {{nowadays}} as its main applications include genotoxicity testing, human biomonitoring, DNA repair studies, environmental biomonitoring and clinical studies. It appeals to researchers because of its simplicity, sensitivity, and versatility. Both the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have included the in vivo comet assay in their step-wise approach for genotoxicity testing. Furthermore, last year the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) finally adopted the guideline {{to carry out the}} in vivo mammalian alkaline comet assay in fresh tissue. Although the OECD Guideline takes into account the possibility of freezing tissues or cell nuclei for later analysis, the laboratory should demonstrate competency in freezing methodologies and confirm low ranges of % tail DNA in target tissues of vehicle treated animals, and that positive responses can still be detected. Freezing procedures for tissues have been described in the literature using different methods, but there is currently no agreement on how to best freeze and thaw tissues. The possibility of freezing the samples may be very helpful when handling too many samples, to integrate the comet assay with <b>other</b> <b>toxicological</b> <b>studies,</b> or to combine its endpoint with other genotoxicity endpoints. Therefore our aim was to test different methods for freezing liver samples, {{in order to be able}} to store the samples for later alkaline comet assay analysis. Liver pieces were obtained directly at necropsy and 4 different procedures were followed to freeze them: 1. - flash freezing in liquid nitrogen and storage at - 80 °C; 2. - flash frozing in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen and storage at - 80 °C; 3. - immersion in RNA later® solution at 4 °C overnight and storage at - 80 °C; 4. - immersion in Merchant buffer at 4 °C overnight and storage at - 80 °C. Besides, we also tried cutting the tissue and homogenizing it using a metal sieve, and storing the resulting cell suspension at - 80 °C both with and without using Mr. Frosty™, before and after filtering through a 100 μM nylon filter and centrifuging it. To process the frozen samples, they were taken out of the freezer and immediately put on ice; the tissue was then washed in a beaker with ice-cold Merchant buffer, transferred to another beaker with ice-cold Merchant buffer, cut into pieces with scissors and filtered through a metal sieve. The cell suspension was then filtered through a 100 μM nylon filter and centrifuged. Besides, we also tested the thawing protocol described by Jackson et al. (2013), with the samples which had been flash frozen by inmmersion in liquid nitrogen. None of the different methods used was capable of giving good results, except immersing the liver samples in liquid nitrogen, followed by Jackson’s et al. (2013) thawing protocol, suggesting that the thawing process may be as critical as the freezing process. To sum up, these results highlight the importance of deepening the possibility to perform the comet assay with frozen tissue...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{gradients}} of {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides {{were examined in}} the young-of-the-year (YOY) bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) {{in the vicinity of}} a PCB Superfund Site in New Bedford Harbor, Massachusetts, and in the adjacent waters. PCB concentrations in bluefish varied between different locations, and also among fish from a given location. A generally decreasing gradient in PCB concentrations was evident as the bluefish were collected away from the Superfund Site. The average sum of PCB concentrations were highest for bluefish collected in the Upper Harbor between Interstate- 195 Bridge and Coggeshall Street Bridge (Upper Harbor), followed by bluefish in Lower Harbor from north of Popes Island Bridge (Lower Harbor), and bluefish from Outer Harbor south of Hurricane Barrier (Outer Harbor). The levels of PCBs in bluefish from Clarks Cove and PCBs in bluefish from Buzzards Bay were similar and lowest among all bluefish specimens analyzed in the present study. Pesticide concentrations were about one order of magnitude or lower than the PCB concentrations, and the gradient of pesticide concentrations generally followed the gradient of PCB concentrations. Some of the commonly detected pesticides in the order of decreasing concentrations included DDTs and metabolites, heptachlor epoxide, endosulfan sulfate, and α-chlordane. Distribution of PCBs and organochlorine pesticides were examined in the tissues of YOY bluefish from Clarks Cove. PCBs and lipids in the brain samples of YOY bluefish were generally numerically greater than PCBs in the liver samples, but these differences were not statistically significant. PCBs and lipids in hypaxial muscle samples were numerically greater than PCBs in epaxial muscle samples, although these two groups of tissues were not statistically different. Despite the higher susceptibility of lighter PCB homologs to geophysical and biogeochemical weathering processes, the relative dominance of lighter homologs in the Upper Harbor and Lower Harbor samples suggested ongoing or recent sources of these lighter PCBs, particularly Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1016 in this area. The presence of heavier homologs in the Upper Harbor and Lower Harbor bluefish samples could be attributed to Aroclor 1252 and Aroclor 1254 that were being used in relatively smaller quantities in the manufacture of electrical components in addition to Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1016. The concentration of heavier PCB homologs appears to increase in YOY bluefish the further away from the PCB Superfund Site in the Acushnet Estuary the samples were collected. Principal component analyses of PCB 153 normalized concentrations of the individual PCB congeners resulted in two general groupings; a relatively tight group comprised of YOY bluefish from Upper Harbor, Lower Harbor, and Outer Harbor, and a rather loose and more dispersed group comprised of Buzzards Bay bluefish and the tissue samples of bluefish from Clarks Cove. Principal component analyses of major pesticides suggested close groupings of bluefish from Clarks Cove and bluefish from Buzzards Bay. Pesticides in bluefish from Upper Harbor, Lower Harbor, and Outer Harbor formed a loose group, with some bluefish from these locations populating close to Clarks Cove and Buzzards Bay bluefish. Although PCBs have been implicated in various behavioral and health effects in the experimental and field studies, the deleterious effects of chronic exposure to high concentrations of PCBs and the potential for recruitment of New Bedford Harbor YOY bluefish population to the adult stock remains obscure. Adaptive or evolutionary resistance to contaminants have been documented in resident species in some highly contaminated estuaries, however similar responses have not been investigated in the migratory species like bluefish. The {{results of the present study}} provide a reference baseline for YOY bluefish for ‘‘before-and-after’’ comparative studies and <b>other</b> <b>toxicological</b> <b>studies</b> for the New Bedford Harbor Superfund Site that is currently being remediated...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. Heavy metals like copper are toxicants {{commonly}} found in mining, industrial, agricultural and waste effluents in South Africa¡¯s riverine systems. In high concentrations these metals could {{have a negative effect}} not only on river systems, but also on fish populations. It is therefore important to determine the effect of these heavy metals on the fish at an early stage, before the fish show any sign of being exposed to the pollutants and before any bodily functions are affected. It is known that polluted water, especially heavy metal pollution like copper, can cause physiological and biochemical alterations in fish. Histopathology is a mechanism, which can provide an indication of fish health by determining early injury to cells and can therefore be considered an important tool to determine the effect of pollutants like copper on fish tissue. At present very {{little is known about the}} effect of toxicants on the histology of fish tissue of freshwater fishes in South Africa. This is important in gonads, where many variables not only in different fish species, but also in the number of developing germ cells in the testes exist. The large number of fish species and the variation in their anatomy and reproductive patterns make knowledge of the anatomy of all fish species difficult. In order to perform a histopathological analysis, it is important to be familiar with the normal histology of the fish organs that are being investigated. It was therefore necessary to describe the histology of selected organs in South Africa¡¯s freshwater fish species. The Mozambique tilapia, O. mossambicus was chosen as test organism and copper was selected as toxicant. The normal morphology and histology of the testes of O. mossambicus were described in order to serve as a baseline study and to provide histological parameters for further toxicological work on the gonadal histopathology of fish. Fish were exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of copper (CuCl 2) for a short-term (96 hours) in experimental flow-through systems under controlled laboratory conditions (23 ¡¾ 1 ¨¬C). An external investigation of each of the 30 control and 40 copper exposed fish was performed. Standard length, body mass and gonadal mass were recorded and the maturity of each fish was obtained histologically. A light and electron microscopic examination was performed in order to describe the histology and histopathological changes. The histopathological changes were obtained by comparing the histology and ultrastructure of the testis of the control group with the information obtained for the testes that were exposed to copper. Fish obtained from the control group that were run simultaneously with every exposure group were used to describe the normal histology of the testes of O. mossambicus. The aim was to describe the normal morphology and histology of the testes of O. mossambicus so that the information obtained during this investigation could serve as a baseline study when dealing with toxicity studies. The different germ cells of the spermatogenesis process were also described with a view to assess not only the reproductive pattern, but also to provide histological parameters which might form a basis for any toxicological work on the gonadal histopathology of fish. Identification of reproductive biomarkers requires an understanding of all the principal cellular components of the testes and their normal range of variation. The cellular components that were described are the Sertoli and Leydig cells as well as the primary and secondary spermatogonia, primary and secondary spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa. The information on the GSI, gonad reproductive stages as well as the histological examination provided the baseline which was needed for comparison of the testes of fish that were exposed to copper. The cellular and sub-cellular responses at light and electron microscopic level were examined to determine early cell changes and damage in the testes which were caused by different sublethal exposures of copper. There were no differences in the gross structure of the testes of the control group and the group that were exposed to copper. The testes of the fish that were exposed to 0. 16, 0. 40 and 2. 0 mg Cu/§¤ all revealed disorganisation of the lobules, disintegration of the spermatogonia as well as disintegration of the interstitial tissue. The exposure of fish to sublethal concentrations of copper induced histopathological changes in the testes of all three groups of fish that were exposed to copper. The results also showed that the intensity of the histopathological changes increased with an increase in the concentration of copper. As a biomarker of exposure to toxicants, histopathology represents a useful tool to asses the degree of pollution. The results from this investigation showed a decrease in the GSI after being exposed to copper, when compared with the control groups, which were not exposed to copper. The information on the effect of copper on the GSI, gonad reproductive stages as well as the histological examination also provides information on gonadal health and maturational stage. This information however provides structural, rather than functional information regarding gonadal health. The results showed that the GSI and gonadal staging should be used together with the gonadal histopathology in order to provide a baseline for comparison when dealing with <b>other</b> <b>toxicological</b> <b>studies.</b> The information obtained during this investigation showed that fish histology and histopathology could be used as a biomarker to provide information on the effect of heavy metals on fish health. It is however suggested that the information obtained during this investigation should be extended to field investigation in order to be validated as a reliable histopathological biomarker. Prof. J.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Chemical EngineeringLarry E. EricksonPolycarbonate {{products}} {{have been used}} extensively world wide for decades because they are lightweight, shatter-resistant and considered to be safe. Polycarbonate is a thermoplastic {{that is used to}} make compact discs, phones, lenses, and food contact products such as water bottles, baby bottles and food storage containers. For more than half century, there has been interest in polycarbonate (PC) products and the monomer bisphenol-A (BPA) because BPA can leach from food polycarbonate containers. The environmental fate for both chemicals in air, water and soil is of interest, also. To understand the fate of polycarbonate, its main degradation pathways, main degradation mechanisms and main products are reviewed. These pathways are thermal degradation, photo-degradation and hydrolysis under different conditions. Furthermore, key topics like PC degradation kinetics and PC chemical resistance are part of this comprehensive discussion. The biodegradation of BPA has been thoroughly studied. About twelve lab methods for environmental fate are summarized and reviewed to understand the “big picture” for BPA degradation. This includes screening tests, which assess the ready and inherent degradability, to simulation tests for surface waters, soils and wastewater treatment systems. The testing of all methods is examined under conditions close to the real environment fate. Furthermore, the fate distribution for BPA based on the Equilibrium Criterion Model (EQC) model is reviewed. Extensive research on polycarbonate and BPA has been conducted in the last fifty years. During this time, both chemicals have been studied and tested by industry and government agencies.
