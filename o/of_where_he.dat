5|$|After Laser Wizard, Bufo, Forest Wizard, and—unwittingly—Ice King help a {{being named}} Bella Noche pass over into Wizard City, it reveals {{itself to be}} a {{creature}} of pure anti-magic.

Simon, initially unaware <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is, steals a magic carpet from Ash (voiced by Steve Agee), flies to the Ice Kingdom, and enters a hidden sanctum wherein elements of his previous life—such as books, artifacts, and his clothing—have been preserved. He phones Marceline, telling her to rush over and bring her stuffed teddy bear Hambo.|$|E
5|$|During a {{match with}} Mr. Kennedy on the October 1, 2007 episode of Raw, Cena {{suffered}} a legitimate torn pectoral muscle while executing a hip toss. Though finishing the match and {{taking part in}} the scripted attack by Orton after the match, surgery the following day found that his pectoralis major muscle was torn completely from the bone, estimating at the time to require seven months to a year of rehabilitation. As a result, Cena was stripped of the title by Mr. McMahon on the next night's episode of ECW, ending what was the longest WWE Championship reign in over 19 years. Cena's surgery was performed by orthopedic surgeon James Andrews at St. Vincent's Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. Two weeks later in a video update on WWE.com, Dr. Andrews and Cena's physical trainer both said that he was several weeks ahead <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was expected to be in his rehabilitation at that time.

25|$|When the {{proclamation}} for the apprehension of Avery {{and his crew}} reached Trott, {{he was forced to}} either put a warrant out for Avery's arrest or, failing to do so, effectively disclose his association with the pirate. Preferring the former choice {{for the sake of his}} reputation, he alerted the authorities as to pirates' whereabouts, but was able to tip off Avery and his crew before the authorities arrived. Avery's 113-person crew then fashioned their hasty escape, vanishing from the island with only twenty-four men ever captured, six of whom were executed. Avery himself was never seen again. His last words to his men were a litany of conflicting stories <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> planned to go, likely intended to throw pursuers off his trail.|$|E

25|$|The biographies vary {{in their}} {{description}} <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> went, who he met and debated and many other details of his life. Most mention Shankara studying the Vedas, Upanishads and Brahmasutra with Govindapada, and Shankara authoring several key works in his youth, while he was studying with his teacher. It is with his teacher Govinda, that Shankara studied Gaudapadiya Karika, as Govinda was himself taught by Gaudapada. Most also mention a meeting with scholars of the Mimamsa school of Hinduism namely Kumarila and Prabhakara, as well as Mandana and various Buddhists, in Shastrarth (an Indian tradition of public philosophical debates attended by large number of people, sometimes with royalty). Thereafter, the biographies about Shankara vary significantly.

25|$|At the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, Hill was {{positioned}} near the Confederate right along a ridge; {{because of some}} swampy ground along his front, there was a 600-yard gap in Hill's front line, and the nearest brigade behind it was nearly a quarter mile away; the dense vegetation prevented the brigade commander from seeing any Union troops advancing on his position. During the battle, Maj. Gen. George Meade's division routed two of Hill's brigades {{and part of a}} third. Hill required the assistance from Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early's division to repulse the Union attack. Hill's division suffered over 2,000 casualties during the battle, which was nearly two-thirds of the casualties in Jackson's corps; two of his brigade commanders were wounded, one (Maxcy Gregg) mortally. After the battle one of his brigade commanders, Brig. Gen. James J. Archer, criticized him about the gap left in the division's front line, saying that Hill had been warned about it before the battle but had done nothing to correct it. Hill was also absent from his division, and there is no record <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was during the battle; this led to a rumor spread through the lines that he had been captured during the initial Union assault.|$|E

25|$|The {{controversy}} between Daniel and {{his parents}} began when they forbade Daniel from buying and playing the Xbox 360 game Halo 3. Petric’s sister, Heidi Petric, testified in court that Daniel never played the game until he contracted a staphylococcus infection from a jet ski injury and was housebound. Petric {{was introduced to the}} Halo franchise while at the house of his friends, the Cianciolas, leading him to wanting a copy himself. His father, Mark Petric, was a minister at the New Life Assembly of God in Wellington. Both parents objected to the idea of their son playing a violent game with adult ratings and did not find it suitable for him. In Too Young To Kill, Mark claims that he told Daniel if he were to buy any violent video games whatsoever then he would destroy them, which did not sit well with Daniel. Mark testified that Daniel would regularly sneak out of the house at night without either parent’s knowledge and purchase the violent video games that his parents didn't approve <b>of,</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> also did this method with purchasing Halo 3 not long after it released. While housebound, Daniel would sometimes play the game for up to 18 hours at a time without taking a break. Susan eventually caught him playing the game and informed Mark, which lead him to confiscating the game from Daniel for going against his parents' wishes. Mark locked the game in a safe cabinet that also concealed his 9mm Taurus PT-92 handgun. Daniel believed his father would play the game by himself.|$|E
25|$|At the Auto Club Speedway in California, Harvick {{blew his}} engine and it {{forced him to}} not finish the race, which {{resulted}} in his first DNF in 82 starts. Harvick won the first 2009 Nationwide Series race at Bristol, his 1st win in his own car. In addition, he won the Camping World Truck Series race at Martinsville Speedway. During the season, Gil Martin became the new crew chief for Harvick as Childress decided to switch all team members of the No. 07 and No. 29 except the drivers and spotters, thus giving Casey Mears Harvick's crew chief Todd Berrier. In the first five races following the switch, Harvick finished {{with an average of}} 25.4, finishing 34th, 11th, 41st, 17th, and 24th respectively. A short time later, reports surfaced stating that Harvick had asked a release of his contract {{at the end of the}} 2009 season to secure a ride at Stewart Haas Racing for the 2010 season. Harvick did not comment publicly on the subject <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> would be driving in 2010. The first race after the story broke, Kevin finished 6th at the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. His best race came at the Pep Boys Auto 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, where Harvick had the best car in a long run and led for most of the race, but was denied victory after a late race caution from which later eventual race winner Kasey Kahne took advantage of when he went past Harvick on the restart; he finished 2nd.|$|E
