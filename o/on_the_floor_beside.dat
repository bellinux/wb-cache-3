5|$|In {{the centre}} of the {{foreground}} is a figure modelled on Caius Gabriel Cibber's Raving Madness, which at the time was one of two monumental sculptures above the entrance to Bethlem Hospital ("Bedlam"), and a well-known London landmark and symbol of insanity. The chained figure is contorted in agony struggling to escape his bonds, while a daemon pulls {{on one end of the}} chain. Beside this lunatic is an unconscious or dead gambler, his winnings spread <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> him.|$|E
25|$|On October 4, 1970, {{producer}} Paul Rothchild {{became concerned}} when Joplin {{failed to show}} up at Sunset Sound Recorders for a recording session. Full Tilt Boogie's road manager John Cooke drove to the Landmark Motor Hotel in Hollywood where Joplin was staying. He saw Joplin's psychedelically painted Porsche 356 C Cabriolet in the parking lot. Upon entering Joplin's room (#105), he found her dead <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> her bed. The official cause of death was a heroin overdose, possibly compounded by alcohol. Cooke believes Joplin had been given heroin that was much more potent than normal, as several of her dealer's other customers also overdosed that week.|$|E

60|$|I was up {{the next}} morning an hour before daybreak, and {{finished}} my guard, kneeling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dormitory <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> centre stand, for the benefit of such expiring glimmer as the night-lamp afforded in its last watch.|$|R
60|$|He {{came out}} of the gloom and {{approached}} the girl with every outward sign of eagerness. He knelt <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dusty <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> her, his arms stole round her meagre shoulders, and his harsh voice was subdued to tones of gentleness.|$|R
60|$|And the outlaw, {{filled with}} gladness and pride, threw himself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> her.|$|E
60|$|Uncle Mose took a {{chair and}} laid his hat {{carefully}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> it.|$|E

5000|$|In the Tuileries, Élisabeth {{was housed}} in the Pavillon de Flore. [...] Initially <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> queen, she {{switched}} with the Princesse de Lamballe to <b>the</b> second <b>floor</b> in <b>the</b> Pavillon de Flore [...] after some fish market women had climbed in to her apartment through the windows.|$|R

50|$|Talbot tells Vyland and Royale he {{is willing}} to die <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ocean <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> his family. He asks who ordered the {{destruction}} of the plane.

6000|$|GLORIA. Oh, don't apologize. I {{was very}} high and mighty myself; but I've come down since: oh, yes: I've been brought down. (She sits <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> his chair.) ...|$|E

40|$|Forest fire may {{be caused}} by a variety of agents, e. g., {{man-made}} fire, lightning. One of these, as recently confirmed by Jones et al (1990, 1991) quantitatively using the oxidation kinetics of forest litter or leaves, is self-ignition of the layers of litter or leaves deposited <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forest <b>floor.</b> <b>Besides</b> oxidation, <b>the</b> heat which promotes the self-ignition of biologica...|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} in that {{shivering}} circle of light the two men saw the king kneeling up in the cart and Peter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> barn <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> him. <b>The</b> old fox looked at them sideways--snared, a white-faced evil thing. And then, as with a faltering suicidal heroism, he leant forward over the bomb before him, they fired together and shot him through the head.|$|R
50|$|When completed, Clarke's two-storeyed stone {{building}} contained {{residential accommodation}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>floor</b> {{and at least}} two shops <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>floor.</b> <b>Besides</b> accommodating Clarke's Medical Hall, from May 1875 Barnes & Lavers, grocers, also moved into part of the building.

60|$|Mr. Downing {{uttered a}} grunt of satisfaction, and bent {{once more to}} his task. Boots flew about the room. Mr. Downing knelt <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> the basket, and dug like a terrier at a rat-hole.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor old Sammy," [...] he said, {{kneeling}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> the victim, and scratching {{him under}} the ear. [...] "What a beastly shame! It'll take hours to wash all that off him, and he'll hate it." ...|$|E
5000|$|It {{was like}} they had just stopped in time. All these bodies were lying around. Heads were slumped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table ... the old man walking out the door was lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> donuts <b>beside</b> him. <b>The</b> two kids were dead by their bikes; the infant was dead {{in the arms of}} the people ... there were two burned hamburgers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grill.

60|$|In all his adventurous career Chauvelin {{had never}} felt so calm. His heart beat quite evenly, his senses were {{undisturbed}} by the slightest tingling of his nerves. The stealthy sounds {{in the next room}} brought the movements of the aristo perfectly clear before his mental vision. The latter was carrying a small dark lanthorn. As soon as he entered he flashed its light about the room. Then he deposited <b>the</b> lanthorn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> close <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> hearth, and started to feel up the chimney for the hidden receptacle.|$|R
50|$|Voodoo was {{designed}} by its owners Jason and Sharon Black and has a capacity of 1500. The club was constructed by Deluxe from Portadown, Northern Ireland. The club has three VIP rooms.

6000|$|... "Finding it hard work, are you?" [...] I asked, {{crouching}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> him, and {{the dear}} little fellow, with that bright smile of his, shrugging his shoulders {{as if it}} was a matter of indifference, said cheerily: ...|$|E
6000|$|And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully! Smoothed by long fingers, Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers, Stretched <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> here <b>beside</b> you and me. Should I, after tea {{and cakes}} and ices, Have the {{strength}} to force the moment to its crisis? But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed, Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter, I am no prophet--and here's no great matter; I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker, And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker, And in short, I was afraid.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{a cheerful}} apartment, hung with prints, with {{somewhat}} of a school-room aspect, and in much disorder. Books and music lay confused with blue and lilac cottons, patterns, scissors, and papers covered with mysterious dots; there were odd-looking glass bottles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mantel-shelf with odder looking things in them, and saucers holding what Violet, at home, would have called messes; <b>the</b> straw-bonnet lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> and <b>beside</b> it <b>the</b> Scotch terrier, who curled up his lips, showed his white teeth, and greeted the invaders with a growl, which became a bark as Arthur snapped his fingers at him. 'Ha! Skylark, that is bad manners. Where's your mistress? Theodora!' ...|$|R

6000|$|Placing {{his gun and}} snow-shoes in a corner, after solemnly {{responding}} [...] "watchee, watchee," [...] to Macnab's [...] "what cheer," [...] the red-man seated himself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> the stove, with silent {{disregard of}} the chair that his host politely offered.|$|E
6000|$|All {{this was}} {{astonishing}} enough. But what puzzled Mrs. Griggs completely {{was the fact}} that a woman's dress was hanging over a chair before the mirror--a pale blue, silken affair. And <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> it were two little blue satin slippers! ...|$|E
60|$|She {{strained}} {{her ears}} {{to catch a}} sound. For a while she heard nothing. Then came a voice that she knew well; and, abandoning concealment, she came out into the room, and found Jimmy kneeling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> the rifled jewel box.|$|E

5000|$|Musical {{improvisation}} {{during a}} {{one on one}} session {{has also been shown}} to be highly effective with increasing joint attention. Some noted improvisation techniques are using a welcome song that includes the child's name, which allows the child to get used to their surroundings; an adult-led song followed by a child led song and then conclude with a goodbye song. [...] During such sessions the child would most likely sit across from <b>the</b> therapist <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> or <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> therapist <b>on</b> <b>the</b> piano bench. Composing original music that incorporates the child’s day-to-day life with actions and words is also a part of improvisation. The shared music making experience allows for spontaneous interpersonal responses from the child and may motivate the child to increase positive social behaviour and initiate further interaction with the therapist.|$|R
