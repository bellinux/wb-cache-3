40|$|White {{blood cells}} (WBCs) and their subtypes are {{important}} constituents {{of the human}} immune system as their concentration, quantified by a WBC count test, indicates the state of body’s immune response against infections. These cell count tests are important prognostic and diagnostic indicators {{for a number of}} human immunological diseases, most prominent of them being AIDS. Flow cytometry (FC) is the gold standard for counting WBCs. Although high throughput and accurate, FC based instruments are bulky, expensive and require skillful and trained personnel for their operation and maintenance. This necessitates the development of inexpensive, portable point-of-care (POC) systems for capturing and enumerating WBCs and their subtypes. We envision a portable, point-of-care WBC counting system which can capture thousands of WBCs and simultaneously image and count them. Towards this end, we have developed: -	A microfluidic biochip for trapping and counting WBCs. The biochip has a novel 3 D cell trapping architecture and enables simultaneous capture and counting of thousands of WBCs. A WBC trapping efficiency of ~ 90 % is achieved using the biochip. -	Microlens arrays with a large field of view (FOV) imaging capability that have an <b>optical</b> performance (<b>numerical</b> <b>aperture,</b> resolution) equivalent to a conventional microscope objective. 	We envision that the cell trapping biochip and the microlens arrays proposed in this thesis can be integrated to perform simultaneous on-chip capture and imaging/counting of WBCs. The integrated microsystem can also be used as a generic platform for sorting and enumeration of different kinds of cells for disease diagnosis and research applications...|$|R
50|$|Like {{objective}} lenses, condensers vary {{in their}} <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture</b> (NA). It is NA that determines optical resolution, {{in combination with the}} NA of the objective. Different condensers {{vary in their}} maximum and minimum <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture,</b> and the <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture</b> of a single condenser varies depending on the diameter setting of the condenser aperture. In order for the maximum <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture</b> (and therefore resolution) of an objective lens to be realized, the <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture</b> of the condenser must be matched to the <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture</b> of the used objective.

40|$|A {{numerical}} model {{was developed to}} simulate the effects of tissue <b>optical</b> properties, objective <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture</b> (N. A.), and instrument performance on two-photon-excited fluorescence imaging of turbid samples. Model data are compared with measurements of fluorescent microspheres in a tissuelike scattering phantom. Our {{results show that the}} measured two-photon-excited signal decays exponentially with increasing focal depth. The overall decay constant is a function of absorption and scattering parameters at both excitation and emission wavelengths. The generation of two-photon fluorescence is shown to be independent of the scattering anisotropy, g, except for g > 0. 95. The N. A. for which the maximum signal is collected varies with depth, although this effect is not seen until the focal plane is greater than two scattering mean free paths into the sample. Overall, measurements and model results indicate that resolution in two-photon microscopy is dependent solely on the ability to deliver sufficient ballistic photon density to the focal volume. As a result we show that lateral resolution in two-photon microscopy is largely unaffected by tissue optical properties in the range typically encountered in soft tissues, although the maximum imaging depth is strongly dependent on absorption and scattering coefficients, scattering anisotropy, and objective N.

40|$|Abstract:- To use plastic {{optical fibers}} {{it is useful}} to know their <b>numerical</b> <b>apertures.</b> These fibers have a large core diameter, which is very {{different}} from those of glass fibers. For their connection a strict adjustment to the properties of the optical systems is needed, injecting the light inside and collecting it outside so as not to increase the losses resulting of their strong absorption. If it is sufficient to inject the light at the input with an aperture lower than the theoretical aperture without core stopping, it is very useful to know the out <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture</b> which is varying with the injection aperture and the length of the fiber, because the different modes may be not coupled and are not similarly absorbed.
