5|$|Although Wordsworth {{places a}} similar {{emphasis}} <b>on</b> <b>living</b> {{in harmony with}} nature in his poetry, Coleridge's view {{is different from that}} of Wordsworth's in that he believed that nature represents a physical presence of God's word; this is combined with a Neoplatonic understanding of God that emphasises the need to understand the divine in order to embrace it.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} {{about the impact of}} spaceflight <b>on</b> <b>living</b> creatures at the time of Laika's mission, and the {{technology}} to de-orbit had not yet been developed, so Laika's survival was never expected. Some scientists believed humans would be unable to survive the launch or the conditions of outer space, so engineers viewed flights by animals as a necessary precursor to human missions. The experiment aimed to prove that a living passenger could survive being launched into orbit and endure a Micro-g environment, paving the way for human spaceflight and providing scientists with some of the first data on how living organisms react to spaceflight environments.|$|E
5|$|Megaloceros or Irish Elk is {{a species}} from the Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs in Eurasia. Hawkins built a family unit of male, female and fawn; the adult male bore antlers made from actual fossil antlers, long since replaced. Moved {{from the third}} island, they had fallen into {{disrepair}} {{as they were in}} a place easily accessible by vandals. With their original but fragile antlers, the Irish Elks were the most accurate of the models; since they are of recent geological age (dying out 11,000 years ago), Hawkins was able to model them <b>on</b> <b>living</b> deer.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the relationship between satisfaction with implant-supported fixed rehabilitations (ISFPR), their impacts <b>on</b> daily <b>living,</b> and personality profiles. Materials and Methods: Fifty patients (15 men and 35 women; mean age 44. 3 ± 9 years), with fitted ISFPR, and 50 partially dentate controls matched with age and gender participated in this study. A Dental Impact on Daily Living questionnaire was used to assess dental satisfaction and impacts of ISFPR <b>on</b> daily <b>living.</b> NEO Five Factor inventory was used to assess participants' personality profiles. Pearson correlation, analysis of variance, and linear regression tests were used for statistical analysis of the data. Results: Patients with ISFPR were more satisfied with their dentition than controls (p<. 05). Patients and controls demonstrated different relationships between personality, impacts <b>on</b> daily <b>living,</b> and satisfaction. Neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness had significant relationships with satisfaction and impacts <b>on</b> daily <b>living</b> in both groups (p<. 05). Openness and agreeableness had significant relationships with satisfaction and impacts <b>on</b> daily <b>living</b> in patients' group (p<. 05). Conclusion: ISFPR had positive impacts <b>on</b> participants' daily <b>living</b> and dental satisfaction. Personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and consciousness) impact <b>on</b> daily <b>living</b> and satisfaction with ISFPR, and might predict satisfaction with ISFPR and their impacts <b>on</b> daily <b>living...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Fifth Earl {{also built}} the Grade II* listed Gardener's House {{at the back}} of the park, in a similar Palladian style. The head {{gardener}} of Althorp resided at the villa in the 18th century. Princess Diana had been intent <b>on</b> <b>living</b> in the house following her separation from Prince Charles, but due to security concerns it was considered unfeasible. Of particular note is its Victorian three-quarter life-sized marble sculpture, The Shipwrecked Mariner, depicting a sailor reaching desperately from a raft. Charles Spencer has since moved it from the main portico of Gardener's House to the main house.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of Saadanius provides new evidence for competing hypotheses about the facial {{appearance of the}} ancestral crown catarrhines, or common ancestor. One reconstruction is based <b>on</b> <b>living</b> catarrhine traits and predicts a short face and a rounded braincase, {{similar to that of}} a gibbon. Another reconstruction, based on the morphology of early Miocene apes and the basal cercopithecoid Victoriapithecus, predicts that the last common ancestor had a projecting snout and tall face, like that of living baboons and the oldest fossil apes and Old World monkeys. The conservative features of Saadanius, {{similar to those of the}} older stem catarrhines, support the latter hypothesis, according to Zalmout et al. However, one palaeontologist, Eric Delson, has cautioned that geological pressure may have distorted the shape of the skull.|$|E
5|$|The sponge {{benefits}} {{from the fact that}} living on the scallop prevents it from being buried in sediment. In the wild it has been found that the scallops and their encrusting sponges both grow to a larger size in areas of high turbidity. A laboratory study showed that, in conditions where the sediment was frequently stirred up, sponges on empty scallop shells all died while those <b>on</b> <b>living</b> shells flourished. However, another study showed that growth rates in scallops heavily encrusted by sponges were significantly lower than in unencumbered ones.|$|E

Angelika is drowned by her father, becoming the 12th victim. The Brothers reach the tower while the Queen breathes an ice wind that puts out the forest fire. Delatombe notices that the Grimms have escaped and goes after them with Cavaldi. When Cavaldi refuses to kill the Grimms, Delatombe shoots him but is later impaled by Will.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most common}} {{radiation}} sources, polonium-210 emits very little gamma radiation, but {{large amounts of}} alpha particles which do not penetrate even {{a sheet of paper}} or the epidermis of human skin, and is therefore invisible to normal radiation detectors. This explained why tests conducted by doctors and Scotland Yard at the hospital with Geiger counters were negative. Both gamma rays and alpha particles are classified as ionizing radiation which can cause radiation damage. An alpha-emitting substance can cause significant damage only if ingested or inhaled, acting <b>on</b> <b>living</b> cells like a short-range weapon. Hours before his death, Litvinenko was tested for alpha-emitters using special equipment.|$|E
5|$|As {{temperatures}} {{continue to}} rise, the last animal {{life will be}} driven back toward the poles, and possibly underground. They would become primarily active during the polar night, aestivating during the polar day due to the intense heat. Much of the surface would become a barren desert and life would primarily {{be found in the}} oceans. However, due to a decrease of the amount or organic matter coming to the oceans from the land as well as oxygen in the water, life would disappear there too following a similar path to that on Earth's surface. This process would start with the loss of freshwater species and conclude with invertebrates, particularly those that do not depend <b>on</b> <b>living</b> plants such as termites or those near hydrothermal vents such as worms of the genus Riftia. As a result of these processes, multi-cellular lifeforms may be extinct in about 800 million years, and eukaryotes in 1.3 billion years, leaving only the prokaryotes.|$|E

5|$|Auricularia auricula-judae grows {{upon the}} wood of {{deciduous}} trees and shrubs, favouring elder. In up to 90% of cases, the mushroom is found on elder, but it is often incorrectly assumed to grow exclusively on elder. It has also been recorded on Acer pseudoplatanus (known in the United Kingdom as sycamore), beech, ash, spindle, and in one particular case, the sycamore draining board of an old sink in Hatton Garden. Recently, A. auricula-judae has been recorded from semi-evergreen to evergreen and wet evergreen shola forests in the Western Ghats, India. This species occurs scattered and in clusters on dead or dying branches of trees, on main trunk, decaying logs, etc. This species occurs during the monsoon period in large imbricate clusters and under high humid conditions produces exceptionally large sized basidiomes. A. auricula-judae growing in wet evergreen and shola forests shows remarkable variation in size, shape and colour. In Australia, it is found in Eucalyptus woodland and rainforests; in the rainforests, it can grow in very large colonies on fallen logs. It favours older branches, where it feeds as a saprophyte (on dead wood) or a weak parasite (<b>on</b> <b>living</b> wood), and it causes white rot.|$|E
5|$|In 1796 Georges Cuvier {{presented}} a paper <b>on</b> <b>living</b> and fossil elephants comparing skeletal remains of Indian and African elephants to fossils of mammoths and {{of an animal}} he would later name mastodon utilizing comparative anatomy. He established {{for the first time}} that Indian and African elephants were different species, and that mammoths differed from both and must be extinct. He further concluded that the mastodon was another extinct species that also differed from Indian or African elephants, more so than mammoths. Cuvier made another powerful demonstration of the power of comparative anatomy in paleontology when he {{presented a}} second paper in 1796 on a large fossil skeleton from Paraguay, which he named Megatherium and identified as a giant sloth by comparing its skull to those of two living species of tree sloth. Cuvier’s ground-breaking work in paleontology and comparative anatomy led to the widespread acceptance of extinction. It also led Cuvier to advocate the geological theory of catastrophism to explain the succession of organisms revealed by the fossil record. He also pointed out that since mammoths and wooly rhinoceros were not the same species as the elephants and rhinoceros currently living in the tropics, their fossils could not be used as evidence for a cooling earth.|$|E
5|$|In Cuvier's {{landmark}} 1796 paper <b>on</b> <b>living</b> and fossil elephants, {{he referred}} to a single catastrophe that destroyed life {{to be replaced by}} the current forms. As a result of his studies of extinct mammals, he realized that animals such as Palaeotherium had lived before the time of the mammoths, which led him to write in terms of multiple geological catastrophes that had wiped out a series of successive faunas. By 1830, a scientific consensus had formed around his ideas as a result of paleobotany and the dinosaur and marine reptile discoveries in Britain. In Great Britain, where natural theology was very influential in the early 19th century, a group of geologists that included Buckland, and Robert Jameson insisted on explicitly linking the most recent of Cuvier's catastrophes to the biblical flood. Catastrophism had a religious overtone in Britain that was absent elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Most millipedes are detritivores {{and feed}} on decomposing vegetation, feces, or organic matter mixed with soil. They often play {{important}} roles in the breakdown and decomposition of plant litter: estimates of consumption rates for individual species range from 1 to 11 percent of all leaf litter, depending on species and region, and collectively millipedes may consume nearly all the leaf litter in a region. The leaf litter is fragmented in the millipede gut and excreted as pellets of leaf fragments, algae, fungi, and bacteria, which facilitates decomposition by the microorganisms. Where earthworm populations are low in tropical forests, millipedes {{play an important role}} in facilitating microbial decomposition of the leaf litter. Some millipedes are herbivorous, feeding <b>on</b> <b>living</b> plants, and some species can become serious pests of crops. Millipedes in the order Polyxenida graze algae from bark, and Platydesmida feed on fungi. A few species are omnivorous or occasionally carnivorous, feeding on insects, centipedes, earthworms, or snails. Some species have piercing mouth parts that allow them to suck up plant juices.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} century BC, Alcmaeon of Croton in Magna Grecia, first {{considered}} the brain to be {{the seat of the}} mind. Also in {{the fifth century}} BC in Athens, Hippocrates believed the brain to be the seat of intelligence. Aristotle, in his biology initially believed the heart to be the seat of intelligence, and saw the brain as a cooling mechanism for the blood. He reasoned that humans are more rational than the beasts because, among other reasons, they have a larger brain to cool their hot-bloodedness. Aristotle did describe the meninges and distinguished between the cerebrum and cerebellum. Herophilus of Chalcedon in the fourth and third centuries BC distinguished the cerebrum and the cerebellum, and provided the first clear description of the ventricles; and with Erasistratus of Ceos experimented <b>on</b> <b>living</b> brains. Their works are now mostly lost, and we know about their achievements due mostly to secondary sources. Some of their discoveries had to be re-discovered a millennium after their deaths. Anatomist physician Galen in the second century AD, {{during the time of the}} Roman Empire, dissected the brains of sheep, monkeys, dogs, and pigs. He concluded that, as the cerebellum was denser than the brain, it must control the muscles, while as the cerebrum was soft, it must be where the senses were processed. Galen further theorized that the brain functioned by movement of animal spirits through the ventricles.|$|E
