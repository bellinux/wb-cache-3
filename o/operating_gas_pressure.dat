40|$|An intense H^- beam of {{a single}} beamlet is {{extracted}} from a large multicusp plasma source operated with cesium seeding. The H^- beams are accelerated up to 100 keV by a single-stage or a two-stage electrode system. Spatial profiles of the beams are measured calorimetrically and a minimum beam divergence angle of 5 mrad is achieved at a H^- current density of 30 mA/cm^ 2 with a beam energy of 100 keV. A ratio of an acceleration current to a H^- current increases abruptly when a H^- current saturates in the space charge limited region. This enhancement is mainly due to secondary electrons caused by the intersection of H^- beams with an extraction grid. When an <b>operating</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> decreases, {{the ratio of the}} acceleration current to the H^- current decreases. This is related to a stripping loss of H^- ions in the electrodes. A beam divergence angle becomes minimum when a ratio of V_acc to V_ext is set at a optimum value of I. 6 in the single-stage acceleration. This ratio is almost the same as that in the double-stage acceleration, where the optimum ratio of E_accl/E_ext is I. 5. In the optimum E_accl/E_ext ratio the divergence angle is not affected by V_acc 2. The divergence angle can be reduced by changing V_acc 2 even if the ratio of E_accl/E_ext is not optimized.

5000|$|X-rays are {{generated}} when high energy electrons are {{stopped by a}} hard target. In the earliest tubes, the electrons were generated by the collision of positive ions with the cathode. To produce the ions, a low <b>pressure</b> <b>gas</b> had to be maintained inside the tube. Unfortunately, as this type of tube is used, the low <b>pressure</b> <b>gas</b> is gradually depleted causing the tube current and therefor the x-ray output to fall. The operator could compensate for this by increasing the voltage on the tube, but this would produce “harder” or more penetrating x-rays. In many cases this degraded the image quality. One early solution was to introduce {{a small amount of}} gas back into the tube. Unfortunately this procedure was difficult to control and it only provided a temporary solution. Saÿen’s design solved this problem by a clever strategy that ensured a constant <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> in the tube. As the gas in {{the main part of the}} Saÿen tube (see photo) is depleted, the electrical resistance in the tube would increase causing the current to take a lower resistance path: a spark through the air gap to the wire leading to the smaller bulb. That current would heat the material in the small bulb and cause it to release gas back into the main tube. Once the <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> rose in the main tube, its electrical resistance would drop back into normal <b>operating</b> range. The <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> in the tube could be adjusted by controlling the size of the air gap: a larger gap meant that the tube would operate at a higher voltage with harder (higher energy, more penetrating) x-rays. Saÿen used potash (potassium hydroxide, KOH) in the side bulb but other chemicals that would outgas when heated were also used. [...] James W.

The variable parameters investigated were scanning velocity, <b>operating</b> current, <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> and stand off distance. After single pass scanning treatment, four types of surfaces were observed. They were fully-melted, partially-melted, non-melted and inconstant-affected where each type of surface indicated different type of roughness. This work has showed that scanning speed and operating current was significantly influence the type of surface and roughness values. Analysis on nonmelted surface after treatment gives maximum depth of hardened layer of about 186. 7 um as well as hardness values of about 1100 HV 50. It was also observed that the depth of harden layer and hardness value was significantly decreases with increase in scanning speed or with decreasing operating current. Microstructure analysis on hardened layer also revealed the formation of martensite structure. Single pass scanning treatment produced approximately 2 mm width of hardened surface. Larger area of hardened surface could be produced by multiple pass scanning treatment. However the treatment produced uneven hardness due to reheating effect on prior hardened layer. The results from this work indicate that plasma arc is viable tool for surface hardening...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} study on the {{modelling}} of stationary DC and microwave glow discharges in the mixture nitrogen-oxygen, for pressures around one Torr and ionization degrees between 10 "-" 7 and 10 "-" 4. The model is based on the self-consistent solutions to the electron Boltzmann equation coupled to the rate balance equations for the most important neutral species and to the continuity equations for the charged particles. The results are obtained {{as a function of the}} usual discharge <b>operating</b> parameters (<b>gas</b> <b>pressure,</b> discharge current or electron density, mixture composition and tube radius) and of the gas temperature. The maintenance electric field is self-consistently determined. The complex interplay kinetics is analysed in detail, it is shown that the distribution of vibrationally excited nitrogen molecules plays a central role in the whole problem, and the effects of the poor knowledge of some collisional and surface data on the results are discussed. The model is used to investigate in detail the mechanisms for ionization, dissociation and atomic re association in a #NU#_ 2 discharge. Finally, some special items are considered, such as the inclusion of the effects of negative ions O"- on the characteristics for the plasma maintenance or of the surface processes responsible for the recombination of oxygen atoms on the tube wallsAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
