40|$|Hydrodynamic journal {{bearings}} are critical power transmission components that are carrying increasingly high loads {{because of the}} increasing power density in various machines. Therefore, knowing the true operating conditions of hydrodynamic {{journal bearings}} is essential to machine design. <b>Oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is one of the}} key operating parameters describing the operating conditions in hydrodynamic journal bearings. Measuring the <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> in bearings has been a demanding task and therefore the subject has been studied mainly by mathematical means. The aim of this study was to determine the <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> in real hydrodynamic journal bearings under realistic operating conditions. The study focused on engine bearings. Test rig experiments, simulations and calculations were carried out to determine the <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> and to understand its relationship with other operating parameters. The main test apparatus was a versatile bearing test rig with a hydraulic loading system. The operating ranges of the bearings were determined by a novel method and the friction loss was determined by a heat flow analysis. The <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> was measured by optical pressure sensors integrated in the bearings. The Author was a member of the research team that developed these sensors. The realistic <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> was measured under hydrodynamic lubrication in realistic operating conditions. Significant differences between the measured and simulated <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> distributions were found.

If the eccentricity at the centre of the bearing, the angle of the shaft centre relative to the bearing centre and the attitude angle of the shaft can be determined, then it is possible to quantitatively determine the maximum <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> taking the elastic deformation of the bearing into account by the method described in this paper...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the concept of}} the Elasto-Hydrodynamic Lubrication?EHL?of thrust slide-bearings in scroll compressors, resulting in the superior lubrication characteristics of these bearings. The thrust plate undergoes elastic deformation due to axial loading, resulting in the formation of a uniform fluid wedge between the orbiting and fixed thrust plates. This wedge region has very high induced <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure,</b> which explains the remarkably good lubrication characteristics of the thrust slide-bearing. Furthermore, the high <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> induces further local elastic deformation of the thrust plate, forming an EHL oil pocket with the thrust plate and a further increase in the <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> between the sliding surfaces due to this oil envelopment. The formation of the EHL pocket was confirmed using FEM analysis and lubrication tests on the elastic deformation of the thrust plate. Subsequently, the additional increase in <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure,</b> due to the EHL pocket effect, was examined in computer simulations applying the average Reynolds equation for the boundary of elastic deformation of the thrust plate.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a nunerical technique for the computational analysis of ruptured liquid films in both steadily and dynamically loaded bearings. The approach is based on the principle of oil flow continuity. A cavitation algorithm, proposed by H. G. Elrod, was implemented for studies of hydrodynamic lubrication in infinitely long cylinder/plane bearings (i. e. non-conformal contacts) under combined sliding, rolling and normal motion. Difficulties involved in the implementation of this algorithm were investigated in great depth. A new 'improved' method of solution, which is well-suited to the computational analyses of steadily and dynamically loaded bearings, was developed. The improved technique involves the solution of the hydrodynamic lubrication problem for <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressures</b> or degrees of lubricant filling in the full film and cavitated regions of a bearing. Detailed studies of cylinder/plane under conditions of both instantaneous and sinusoidal normal motion were performed. The improved solution was shown to facilitate the implicit implementation of the Jakobsson-Floberg- 011 son boundary conditions (i. e. the inclusion of 'oil film history' phencinena) in dynamically loaded bearing analyses. Detailed comparisons between the <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> history and classical solutions, and published experimental studies were made. Computer programs based on the classical Reynolds equation and the improved method of solution were developed for the analysis of circuTiferentially grooved, finite journal bearings operating under steady-state and dynamic loading conditions. The improved method of solution produced more realistic predictions of performance characteristics, particularly <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> extent, <b>oil</b> flow and bearing power loss. Comprehensive comparisons with published theoretical and experimental studies were made. Encouraging agrenent was obtained between the oil flow continuity analyses and experiments.

40|$|The {{opening delay}} of a {{discharge}} reed valve for compressors {{caused by the}} stiction force of the oil film between the reed and the valve seat is investigated. The coupling simulation algorithm including models of cavitation in the oil film is developed. In order to check the validity, the numerical simulation is performed under several conditions of a model experiment. The coupling model consists of the reed deformation, the gas flow, and the oil film flow with cavitation. The two-dimensional reed deformation is expressed by expanding natural modes that are obtained by the finite element method using shell elements. The gas flow is expressed by the thermodynamic model under the assumption of the internal reversible process. The two-dimensional <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution is obtained by solving numerically the Reynolds’ equation through the finite volume method. On the model of cavitation in the oil film, {{in addition to the}} case in which cavitation is not taken into account, two cavitation models are tested; the static cavitation model (Reynolds’ condition) in which the minimum oil pressure is set to absolute zero, and the dynamic cavitation model in which the <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> can fall to the absolute negative (tensile in the liquid) due to the direct simulation of the bubble expansion. Comparisons on the opening delay time between simulation results and the experimental result show that the static cavitation model gives the earlier delay time than that in the experiment, and the dynamic cavitation model which simulates the absolute negative pressure in the oil film reproduces accurately the experimental delay time. The simulation through the dynamic cavitation model also reproduces well behaviors of cavitation and blow-by flow (oil film rupture) in the oil film captured by the high-speed camera in the experiment. The relation among the pressure, the thickness, and the cavitation area of the oil film that are obtained in the simulation shows the mechanism of the oil film rupture (valve opening), i. e., the cavitation bubbles promote the increase of the oil film thickness during the stiction and the increased oil film thickness causes the recovery of the <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure,</b> and the subsequent blow-by flow (oil film rupture) ...|$|E

40|$|Previous studies [Refs. 1, 2] {{revealed}} {{the formation of}} a uniform oil wedge at the periphery of the thrust plate, caused by the elastic deformation of the orbiting thrust plate due to the pressure difference across the orbiting thrust plate, is a significant factor in the high lubrication performance in thrust slide-bearings. In addition to the uniform wedge formation, the high <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> also induces a local elastic deformation of the fixed thrust plate normal to its surface. The normal thrust plate deformation and the oil wedge effectively form an elasto-hydrodynamic-lubrication (EHL) pocket, even more effectively increasing the <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> between the sliding surfaces, due to the envelopment of the oil, as confirmed in our companion paper [3], and an earlier, less-detailed contribution [4].

Bearing varnish results in a large decrease of minimum clearance and an increase in the <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> temperature and <b>pressure.</b> Loading capacity of bearing is also decreased. It is harmful to the bearing. With the varnish, the minimum <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> thickness decreases. This leads to an increase of bearing stiffness and damping coefficients.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the project is to characterise piston ring lubrication in reciprocating test rigs and engines in terms of film thickness {{as a function of}} oil properties, reciprocating speed and load. A purpose-built test rig, which consists of a moving liner and a fixed piston ring, is used to measure the oil film thickness employing the capacitance and laser induced fluorescence (LIF) techniques. The intensity of the fluorescent light measured as voltage is interpreted as film thickness through calibration. Ring profile fitting is being used as the standard calibration method, but also a dynamic technique has been proposed whereby a groove of known depth on a piston ring specimen is used to provide in-situ dynamic calibration, circumventing the uncertainties of oil film temperature and properties variation during the cycle. A micrometer based static calibration method is compared directly to the dynamic one. The power output of the fibres should be taken into account as well as background noise and resident voltage on the fluorescence detector. Extensive oil parametric studies have been conducted and oil film thickness, LIF, friction and <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements are presented and compared for different speed, load, temperature, lubricant type and piston-ring geometry. The goal of enhancing the repeatability of the parametric study was achieved through the different positioning of the capacitance transducer and through the increased rigidity of the simulation rig. Useful results were drawn and the effect of properties such as viscosity, viscosity index, HTHS, piston - ring curvature and ring "effective width" on film thickness, film pressure and friction could be determined. Viscosity remains an important factor. Oil flow visualisation using a CCD camera allowed observation of cavitation throughout the stroke through a glass liner. At mid-stroke the presence of string cavities was evident, whereas near the dead centres the initiation of cavitation was observed in the form of fern-shaped cavities at the diverging wedge of the piston ring specimen at all times. The cavities take the shape of ferns, grown ferns, fissures, strings and bubbles. The existence of the cavities, previously identified indirectly with the LIF technique, was further supported by measurements using a new aluminium liner which incorporates a miniature pressure transducer used for the first time for <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements and an optical fibre. The <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements provided further support to the interpretation of cavitation at different parts of the stroke. The transition between different cavitating conditions (from P vapour to P atm) previously identified in the minimum oil film thickness measurement signal was further supported by the addition of the glass liner and the pressure transducer. Eventually, an insight was obtained into the onset and development of cavitation in the piston assembly via the simulation test rig, which will encourage further efforts in modelling cavitation under a much wider range of operating conditions than those examined here. Engine testing under motoring conditions was conducted in a modified single cylinder engine with parts of the liner cut and fitted with quartz windows for visualisation experiments. Comparable cavity forms to the test rig were identified and an approach towards their formation is presented. It became clear that the numerous factors affecting the lubrication between the piston-rings and cylinder liner in the engine are giving a different picture compared to the single-ring test rig where the structures are more uniform and the transition fi-om one cavitation type to another is much clearer. The unavailability of the <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements for the engine, though, does not support as strongly the findings from imaging. The top compression ring operates under starved lubrication conditions. Oil droplets were captured by the camera emerging from the ring side clearances that contribute to oil transport. Higher magnification imaging gave further evidence and was compared with previous engine research on oil transport. The engine study was limited by the unclear images obtained from the CCD camera and the window size which on one hand has the required size for the fixture firing tests and on another is quite small to provide adequate information about the residence time of the cavities that were identified. Another limiting factor of the study regarding the simulation test rig is that it can only provide data for the case of atmospheric conditions. Imperial Users onll...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{reported}} in this thesis {{was to develop a}} method, suitable for general design work, to determine the stability of a simple rotor mounted in hydrodynamic bearings, The rotor model used was a simple spring mass system, but the bearing model allowed a comprehensive range of bearing cross-sectional shapes and grooves to be assessed. The <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> equations were solved by the successive over-relaxation finite difference technique. The problem was approached by considering the energy balance of the bearing-rotor system. The hydrodynamic <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>film</b> in the bearing performs work on the journal and this is largely responsible for the decay or growth of the rotor motion. The behaviour of a simple rotor was investigated to determine if its influence on the bearing could be represented by a simple force locus as this would allow the <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> work to be calculated without marching out the rotor locus. In general, the force exerted by the rotor on the journal is too complex to allow a direct assessment of the stability of a system by this technique. The flexibility and ease of operation of the directly loaded bearing computer program make it useful for comparisons of bearing design features and load conditions. An investigation was carried out into the effect of the bearing parameters on the <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> work when the journal is loaded with a circular force locus. An attempt was made to reduce the computation necessary to march out the journal and rotor loci. The approach taken was to improve the utilisation of the information obtained from the <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> equations. Although significant reductions in the computation were achieved, they were insufficient to justify the additional program complexity...|$|R
40|$|How {{to improve}} the {{rotation}} speed of heavy/large CNC vertical lathe, the machining efficiency, and machining precision {{is one of the}} key issues which need to be solved urgently. Hydrostatic thrust bearing is the key part to the heavy/large CNC vertical lathe; its performance directly affects the machining quality and operation efficiency. This paper analyses the latest research results from the perspective of the mechanical properties of hydrostatic thrust bearing, <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> lubrication, static <b>pressure</b> bearing thermal deformation, and the high efficiency refrigeration and evaluates the future scientific research direction in this area. Analysis shows that with the development of hydrostatic thrust bearing to the high speed, high precision, high efficiency, high stability, high multifunction, and high power, the study of hydrostatic thrust bearing will focus on the optimal design of the oil chamber to produce the least amount of heat, how to control the thermal deformation of hydrostatic thrust bearing, and the high efficiency refrigeration to ensure the machining accuracy of CNC equipment...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 19 - 30 Capacities at today?s modern {{ethylene}} and refinery {{plants have}} steadily increased, {{giving rise to}} a growing demand for larger compressors and more powerful drivers all of which require larger rotating parts. In keeping with this trend, it is critically important to optimize the design of rotors, impellers and journal bearings for improved rotor dynamics and high performance fluid dynamics. Rotor stability itself can be greatly influenced by maintaining schroter bearing spans through careful impeller design and the proper selection of journal bearings, such as load-on-pad (LOP) or load-between-pad (LBP) types, and determining the correct number of pads. In order to achieve a robust compressor design, case studies can be important tools in understanding the actual behavior and dynamic characteristics of large journal bearings. In this paper, the authors will present {{the results of a}} unique test to measure and compare the <b>oil</b> <b>film</b> profile, <b>pressure</b> and temperature along the bearing pad surface as well as the pad movement vibration for several types of journal bearings under rotating conditions. The dynamic data are compared with 3 D finite element analysis/computational fluid dynamics (FEA/CFD) results for each type of journal bearing including rotor response comparison with experiment and analysis. The design and performance of improved impellers to create high shaft rigidity and shorter bearing spans are also discussed. Finally,the authors will present their findings on optimum designs for large journal bearings and make recommendations on how to model journal bearings by separating each pad in the vibration system...|$|R
