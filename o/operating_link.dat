50|$|Public {{transportation}} in Lynnwood {{is provided by}} Community Transit, which serves most of Snohomish County, and Sound Transit, the regional system serving the entire metropolitan area. Most bus service in Lynnwood is concentrated at hubs, including the Lynnwood Transit Center, Ash Way Park and Ride, and Edmonds Community College. Community Transit operates local routes, including Swift bus rapid transit on State Route 99, and peak-only commuter service to Downtown Seattle and the University of Washington. Sound Transit operates all-day express service from Lynnwood Transit Center and Ash Way Park and Ride to Downtown Seattle and Downtown Bellevue. In 2023, Sound Transit will begin <b>operating</b> <b>Link</b> light rail service to Lynnwood Transit Center, connecting it to Downtown Seattle and the Bellevue-Redmond area. Light rail service is planned to be extended north to Downtown Everett, via Ash Way and Paine Field, in 2036.|$|E

In other words, all combinations of four randomly spaced bit-flips within a packet boundary must be detected and result in an invalidated packet. Several strategies were combined to achieve the 4-bit hamming distance for 64b/66b packets: 1) strong type fields were chosen with 4-bit hamming distance, 2) the scrambler polynomial was chosen to be compatible with the CRC-32 used for packet protection and 3) protocol violations adjacent to the packet boundaries are required to invalidate the packet. The combination of CRC-32 and the chosen scrambler polynomial were evaluated by exhaustively enumerating all 4-bit error patterns for all possible packet sizes with an optimized C program.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Next-generation {{cellular}} standards may leverage {{the large}} bandwidth available at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies to provide gigabit-per-second data rates in outdoor wireless systems. A main challenge in realizing mmWave cellular is achieving sufficient <b>operating</b> <b>link</b> margin, which is enabled via directional beamforming with large antenna arrays. Due {{to the high}} cost and power consumption of high-bandwidth mixed-signal devices, mmWave beamforming will likely include a combination of analog and digital processing. In this paper, we develop an iterative hybrid beamforming algorithm for the single user mmWave channel. The proposed algorithm accounts for the limitations of analog beamforming circuitry and assumes only partial channel knowledge at both the base and mobile stations. The precoding strategy exploits the sparse nature of the mmWave channel and uses a variant of matching pursuit to provide simple solutions to the hybrid beamforming problem. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed algorithm can approach the rates achieved by unconstrained digital beamforming solutions. I...|$|E

The event Web site at: [URL] emerging theme in next-generation access research includes seamless wireline-wireless convergence addressed by Radio-over-Fiber (RoF) technologies. Optical cabling solutions offer th e possibility for semi-transparent transport through the access network microwave to mm-wave radio carriers commonly employed for creating high-capacity picocell wireless networks, attending present demands from the wireless technologies, with portable/mobile devices converging with photonics. Advanced RoF techniques can efficiently generate and transport such carriers, and deliver them to simplified antenna stations or radio access points (RAPs). Thus, they can convey high data rates in comprehensive modulation formats on multiple-GHz carriers in MMF networks. Selective mode-launching schemes combined {{with the use of}} narrow linewidth optical sources are experimentally demonstrated to enable broadband RF, microwave and mm-wave transmission in short- and middle-reach distances over silica-based multimode optical fibers (MMFs); and are rev iewed in this pap er. However, arbitrary operating conditions, such as the temperature dependence in the fiber link, impose a great challenge for the extension of the RoMMF technology. Temperature impairment ch aracterization is analyzed over the broadband transmission bands that are present, under certain <b>operating</b> <b>link</b> conditions, in the frequency response performance of MMF to support multiple GHz carrier delivering schemes, thus contributing to fault link prevention.
