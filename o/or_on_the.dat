However, he felt that he was due a better contract, and decided to 'call the bluff' of the club by handing in a transfer request. Recovering from injury and abuse from some supporters for his transfer request, he put what many United fans call the best performance of his career at Anfield on 4 April 1988, when he came off a substitute with his team 3–1 down to help United to salvage a point.|$|E
5|$|Blackcaps {{and other}} small birds are {{illegally}} trapped and hunted in large numbers in Mediterranean countries, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Malta, Libya, Egypt and Cyprus, where they are considered as a delicacy. Despite hunting and natural hazards, the European population of the blackcap has been rising for several decades as the range extends northwards, for example to Scotland and Denmark. There are occasional nesting records from outside the main range, such as in northern Israel and the Faroes, and wandering birds may appear further afield in Iceland <b>or</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> islands of Arctic Russia. In the Baltic, {{the spread of the}} blackcap appears to have been helped by the availability of territories formerly occupied by the declining barred warbler.|$|E
5|$|Breeding is {{normally}} from late May to August, {{but may be}} significantly earlier in northwest Africa or western Pakistan.

Fights may take place in flight <b>or</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. The male's display flight involves a similar wing and tail position with frequent wing clapping as he follows the female in a rising spiral. If she lands, he continues to display with bobbing and fluttering until the female spreads her wings and tail for copulation. Mating occasionally takes place on a raised perch instead of the ground. In good habitat, there may be 20pairs per square kilometre (50per square mile).|$|E
