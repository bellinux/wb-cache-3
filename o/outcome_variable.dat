500|$|The psychologists Paul H. Van Wyk and Chrisann S. Geist {{wrote that}} Bell et al. {{question}} a scientific consensus, established by researchers {{such as the}} psychologists Heino Meyer-Bahlburg and John Money, that biological factors have at most only a predisposing influence {{on the development of}} sexual orientation. Using their subject pool, which consisted of people interviewed between 1938 and 1963, Van Wyk and Geist produced results similar to those of Bell et al. However, there were some significant differences, which Van Wyk and Geist suggested could have been partly a result of the different methodology employed. In their view, the most important difference was that their <b>outcome</b> <b>variable</b> was based only on [...] "overt behavior" [...] whereas that of Bell et al. [...] "is an average of subjective preference and overt behavior." [...] They noted that Bell et al. [...] "excluded from their model variables that did not apply to everyone in their sample", which made it impossible to judge the effects of [...] "idiosyncratic and unique sexual and nonsexual experiences".|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impacts of alcohol-induced stress and social support on {{individual}} {{health and well-being of}} alcoholics. Specifically, this dissertation study aimed to test: (a) the direct effect of alcohol-induced stress on three <b>outcome</b> <b>variables</b> that are relevant to an individual's health and well-being, (b) the direct effect of social support on three <b>outcome</b> <b>variables,</b> and (c) the interaction effect between alcohol-induced stress and social support on three <b>outcome</b> <b>variables.</b> This study also attempted to explore the roles of separate sources of social support in relation to three <b>outcome</b> <b>variables.</b> The results showed that stress due to alcohol abuse had direct effects on three <b>outcome</b> <b>variables,</b> indicating that high levels of perceived stress due to alcohol abuse contributed to lower life satisfaction, higher depressive symptoms, and higher physical health problems in alcoholics. It was also found that social support had a direct effect on individuals' health and well-being for two of the three outcomes studied. However, this study found no significant buffering effect of social support in the relationships between stress due to alcohol abuse and its negative outcomes...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores and {{researches}} the <b>outcome</b> <b>variables</b> of loneliness, depression, {{well-being and}} anxiety {{in terms of}} immigration. It investigates the impact and relationships of demographics, personality and coping on these <b>outcome</b> <b>variables.</b> The research sample consisted of South African immigrants {{who had lived in}} New Zealand for six years or less. The research collected quantitative data through a questionnaire. Participants were acquired through the South African New Zealand Trust (SANZ) and by word of mouth, using a snowballing technique. The questionnaire was distributed by post to willing participants. The questionnaire consisted of six scales: the revised UCLA Loneliness scale, the General Health Questionnaire, the Beck's Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the NEO-FFI and a coping scale consisting of items from the Cybernetic Coping Scale and the Cope Scales. In addition to the scales it included questions concerning demographics. Overall, these immigrants experienced normal levels of loneliness, anxiety, depression and well-being. Significant differences in the <b>outcome</b> <b>variables</b> were found for gender, marital status, employment status, pertinent job skills/qualifications, being a member of SANZ, involvement in community activities and distribution of friends. Significant differences were also found for demographics in terms of personality and coping. The predictive ability of personality and coping towards the <b>outcome</b> <b>variables</b> was evaluated. Neuroticism was found to be a significant predictor of the <b>outcome</b> <b>variables,</b> whereas the other personality traits and coping were not significant predictors of the <b>outcome</b> <b>variables...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were {{to examine the effects of}} socialization processes and antecedent variables on children's evaluative criteria for clothing purchases and to examine antecedent variables on the socialization process. A total of 500 parents of children from the first through sixth grade were systematically selected from the Directory of Catalina Foothills School District and mailed a questionnaire. Using principal components factor analysis on parental socialization variables and on evaluative criteria items, nine factors were developed. Based on stepwise multiple regression analysis for each hypothesis, it was concluded that antecedent variables have direct influence on socialization process variables which, in turn, impacts the <b>outcome</b> <b>variables.</b> Antecedent variables, however, tended to have limited direct influence on <b>outcome</b> <b>variables</b> but have an indirect effect on <b>outcome</b> <b>variables</b> only through socialization variables...|$|R

We designed a multimethod assessment strategy, to test the relative contribution of changes in physical capacity and pain-related anxiety to treatment <b>outcome</b> <b>variables.</b> Low back pain patients (n= 59) were treated with an intensive programme of physical exercise and CBT. Comparisons from pre- to post-treatment showed significant improvement in pain severity. interference, affective distress, activity level, and depression. Improvements in pain-related anxiety were associated with improvements in all <b>outcome</b> <b>variables</b> except interference. Of three physical capacity composite scores, improvement in only one (lumbar extension and flexion capacity) was associated with improvements in all <b>outcome</b> <b>variables</b> except interference. Further analyses demonstrated that the relationship between changes in pain-related anxiety and treatment outcome were independent of changes in physical capacity performance. Changes during treatment in pain-related anxiety may be more important than changes during treatment in physical capacity when predicting the effect of treatment on behavioural outcome measures. These results are discussed in the context of how to improve assessment of the chronic pain patient and improve the effectiveness of multidisciplinary CBT...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{cohort study}} with {{prospective}} data collection {{was conducted to}} determine which risk factors and <b>outcome</b> <b>variables</b> are statistically significant clinical predictors of mortality from infective endocarditis. A study was performed from an eleven-year, hospitalization cohort (N= 11, 230) in which {{the data were collected}} prospectively. The study examined 21 potential risk factors and 14 <b>outcome</b> <b>variables.</b> The risk factors were categorized into these various groups: patient factors, cardiac factors, co-morbidities, operative factors, infectious factors, and complications. The <b>outcome</b> <b>variables</b> were categorized into operative factors, infectious factors, and complications. Inclusion criteria included patients with endocarditis (N= 87). Longer operative time, operative complications, and postoperative complications. Overall mortality was 11. 5 percent (N= 10). Endocarditis patients who died were significantly older (p= 0. 023) and had a longer pump time (p= 0. 017) than those who survived. Endocarditis patients who died were more likely to experience an unstable hemodynamic status (p= 0. 012). There was a significant difference between survival and non-survival of patients with endocarditis on nine <b>outcome</b> <b>variables.</b> They were more likely to require a re-operation for bleeding (p= 0. 034). Renal complications (p= 0. 016), neurological complications (p= 0. 004), pulmonary complications (p= 0. 001), intra-operative complications (p= 0. 035), and IAPB (p< 0. 001) were all more likely to occur in endocarditis patients who died. There are risk factors that serve as predictors of mortality from infectious endocarditis. These include age greater than 65 years, longer pump time, and unstable hemodynamic status. <b>Outcome</b> <b>variables</b> that reflected significant mortality included operative complications and post-operative complications.
