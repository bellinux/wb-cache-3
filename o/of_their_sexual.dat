5|$|David Kinsley, {{an expert}} on Hindu goddesses and former Professor of Religion at McMaster University, agrees with the Buddhist origin theory, but sees other influences, too. Ancient Hindu goddesses, who are {{depicted}} nude and headless or faceless, may have also influenced the development of Chhinnamasta. These goddesses are mainly depicted headless {{to focus on the}} display <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> organs, thus signifying sexual vigour, but they do not explain the self-decapitation theme.|$|E

5|$|Torchwood is a British {{science fiction}} drama {{television}} programme, {{part of the}} long-running Doctor Who franchise, which began airing in 2006 on BBC Three. The series explores several themes in its narrative, in particular LGBT themes. Various characters are portrayed as sexually fluid; through those characters, the series examines homosexual and bisexual relationships. Although the nature <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> flexibility is not explicitly discussed, the characters offer varying perspectives on orientation, with The Sun describing all of the characters on Torchwood as bisexual.|$|E
5|$|Berry was {{appointed}} Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, serving from 1997 to 2001. At the Interior Department, Berry improved credit union and continuing education options, oversaw {{the expansion of}} department programs to improve employees' work-life balance, and held town hall meetings with Interior employees and used their suggestions to upgrade a cafeteria and health center. These changes were partly funded through partnerships with federal employees, unions and other agencies to reduce costs for the department. Berry worked to create a complaint procedure for employees who experience discrimination because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation, to expand relocation benefits and counseling services to domestic partners of employees, to establish a liaison to gay and lesbian workers, and to eliminate discriminatory provisions of the National Park Service's law enforcement standards. He helped establish an office supply store for Interior employees, which he staffed with disabled workers. Berry oversaw {{one of the largest}} budgetary increases in the department's history.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, gay men and lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to see themselves as part of the same community with gay men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, gay men and lesbians united to work together on the campaign.|$|E

50|$|The sister {{effect is}} an {{exception}} to male overperception bias. Haselton and Buss (2000) found that sexual overperception bias would not occur when the target the men had to perceive sexual intent from was their sister. They found that the men's perception <b>of</b> <b>their</b> sister's <b>sexual</b> intent was lower than <b>their</b> perception <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> intent from other females. Haselton and Buss (2000) believed that this perception of female sexual interest was most accurate as it fell between women's perception of women (high interest) and women's perception <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own <b>sexual</b> interest (low interest). This could be a product of incest-avoidance mechanisms.|$|R

50|$|For women, {{there is}} often a {{complaint}} about the lack <b>of</b> <b>their</b> spouses' <b>sexual</b> spontaneity. Decreased sexual activity among these women may be the result <b>of</b> <b>their</b> perceived failure to maintain ideal physical attractiveness or because <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> partners' health issues have hindered sexual intercourse. Some women express that <b>their</b> most satisfying <b>sexual</b> experiences entail being connected to someone, rather than solely basing satisfaction on orgasm.

25|$|In {{the last}} decades, a growing {{interest}} towards sexuality {{and a greater}} quest to acknowledge a “right to sexuality” has occurred both in society and individuals.

25|$|According to the Belarusian Ministry of Defense and the Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military of the University of California, Santa Barbara, Belarus bans gays {{from serving}} in the military.

25|$|Studies {{conducted}} in rats {{have indicated that}} <b>their</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> arousal is sensitive to reductions in testosterone.

Therefore, these mammals may provide a model for studying clinical populations among humans suffering from sexual arousal deficits such as hypoactive sexual desire disorder.|$|R

25|$|In {{response}} to the statements relating to prosecutions of persons because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation, {{the head of the}} delegation said that homosexuality is a purely private matter, with a long history in Senegal, and is not in itself a cause for prosecution. The prosecutions referred to occurred only when the homosexual relations took place in public and were of an obtrusive nature, therefore placing them in conflict with morality and religion. Concerning decriminalization, it is necessary to take account of the culture, and avoid exacerbating the rejection of homosexuals and endangering their lives.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study on}} men and women's {{patterns}} of sexual arousal confirmed {{that men and}} women have different patterns of arousal, independent <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> orientations. The study found that women's genitals become aroused to both human and nonhuman stimuli from movies showing humans of both genders having sex (heterosexual and homosexual) and from videos showing non-human primates (bonobos) having sex. Men did not show any sexual arousal to non-human visual stimuli, their arousal patterns being in line with their specific sexual interest (women for heterosexual men and men for homosexual men).|$|E
50|$|Corrective rape is a {{hate crime}} in which one or more people are raped because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{perceived}} <b>sexual</b> orientation or gender identity.
