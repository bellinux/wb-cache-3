Fuel and oxidant are distributed to each cell of a stack through so-called manifolds during its operation. In designing a stack, if the manifold sizes are too small, the fuel and oxidant would be maldistributed among the cells. On the contrary, {{the volume of the}} stack would be too large if the manifolds are oversized. In this study, we present a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model with a geometrically simplified flow-field to optimize the size of the manifolds of a stack. The flow-field of the stack was simplified as a straight channel filled with porous media {{to reduce the number of}} computational meshes required for CFD simulations. Using the CFD model, we determined the size of the <b>oxidant</b> <b>manifold</b> of a 30 kW-class PEM fuel cell stack that comprises 99 cells. The stack with the optimal manifold size showed a quite uniform distribution of the cell voltages across the entire cells...|$|E
40|$|Standard anode {{supported}} micro tubular-solid {{oxide fuel}} cell (MT-SOFC) stacks {{may provide the}} oxidant, {{in relation to the}} fuel, in three different manifold regimes. Firstly, “co-flow” involves oxidant outside the MT-SOFC flowing co-linearly in relation to the fuel inside. Secondly, “counter flow” involves oxidant outside the MT-SOFC flowing counter-linearly in relation to the fuel inside the MT-SOFC. Finally, “cross-flow” involves the oxidant outside the MT-SOFC flowing perpendicular to the fuel flow inside the MT-SOFC. In order to examine the effect of manifold technique on MT-SOFC performance, a combination of numerical simulation and experimental measurements was performed. Furthermore, the cathode current tap location, in relation to the fuel flow, was also studied. It was found that the <b>oxidant</b> <b>manifold</b> and the location of the cathode current collection point on the MT-SOFC tested and modeled had negligible effect on the MT-SOFC’s electrical and thermal performance. In this study, a single MT-SOFC was studied in order to establish the measurement technique and numerical simulation implementation as a prerequisite before further test involving a 7 cell MT-SOFC stack...|$|E
40|$|Monolithic solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (MSOFCS) {{represent}} a potential breakthrough in fuel cell technology, provided that reliable fabrication methods can be developed. Fabrication difficulties arise in several {{steps of the}} processing: First is the fabrication of uniform thin (305 {mu}m) single-layer and trilayer green tapes (the trilayer tapes of anode/electrolyte/cathode and anode/interconnect/cathode must have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to sinter uniformly {{and to have the}} necessary electrochemical properties); Second is the development of fuel and oxidant channels in which residual stresses are likely to develop in the tapes; Third is the fabrication of a "complete" cell for which the bond quality between layers {{and the quality of the}} trilayers must be established; and Last, attachment of fuel and <b>oxidant</b> <b>manifolds</b> and verification of seal integrity. The purpose of this report is to assess nondestructive characterization methods that could be developed for application to laboratory, prototype, and full-scale MSOFCs...|$|R
