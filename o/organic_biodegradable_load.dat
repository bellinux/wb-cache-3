40|$|The {{influence}} of organic nutrient load on biomass accumulation (biofouling) and pressure drop development in membrane filtration systems was investigated. Nutrient load {{is the product}} of nutrient concentration and linear flow velocity. Biofouling - excessive growth of microbial biomass in membrane systems - hampers membrane performance. The {{influence of}} <b>biodegradable</b> <b>organic</b> nutrient <b>load</b> on biofouling was investigated at varying (i) crossflow velocity, (ii) nutrient concentration, (iii) shear, and (iv) feed spacer thickness. Experimental studies were performed with membrane fouling simulators (MFSs) containing a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane and a 31 mil thick feed spacer, commonly applied in practice in RO and nanofiltration (NF) spiral-wound membrane modules. Numerical modeling studies were done with identical feed spacer geometry differing in thickness (28, 31 and 34 mil). Additionally, experiments were done applying a forward osmosis (FO) membrane with varying spacer thickness (28, 31 and 34 mil), addressing the permeate flux decline and biofilm development. Assessed were the development of feed channel pressure drop (MFS studies), permeate flux (FO studies) and accumulated biomass amount measured by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and total organic carbon (TOC). Our studies showed that the organic nutrient load determined the accumulated amount of biomass. The same amount of accumulated biomass was found at constant nutrient load irrespective of linear flow velocity, shear, and/or feed spacer thickness. The impact of the same amount of accumulated biomass on feed channel pressure drop and permeate flux was influenced by membrane process design and operational conditions. Reducing the nutrient load by pretreatment slowed-down the biofilm formation. The impact of accumulated biomass on membrane performance was reduced by applying a lower crossflow velocity and/or a thicker and/or a modified geometry feed spacer.

30|$|Composting <b>organic</b> <b>biodegradable</b> waste takes a {{significant}} amount out of the waste stream going to incineration and landfill. This implies less landfill gas and leachate production. The bigger-scale composting plants in developing Asian countries often use open windrow composting. This aerobic composting approach typically takes about 4 to 6 weeks to reach the stabilized end-product stage. The composting process in this study incorporates emissions both from the energy demand for plant operation and infrastructure. The assumed water content is 50 % by weight [15]. The assumed replaced mineral fertilizer is potassium nitrate (KNO 3), as N. This mineral fertilizer has N content of 14 %, while that of the municipal waste compost fertilizer ranges from 10 % to 22 % [19, 20]. The release of N from mineral fertilizer is, however, quite significant {{in the first year}} (up to 80 %) and low in the following years, while municipal waste compost fertilizer releases N gradually throughout the years (about 10 % per year) [5].

Changes in the polyol composition made through variation of the hydrophilic initiator molecular weight show direct control of the final transition temperatures. Incorporating POSS into the hard segments allows for excellent elasticity above Tg, as evidenced with dynamic mechanical analysis, not seen in most other biodegradable materials. This elasticity is attributed to physical cross-links formed in the hard block through POSS crystallization, as revealed with wide-angle X-ray diffraction. Increasing the POSS incorporation level in the TPU hard block was observed to increase crystallinity and also the rigidity of the material. The highest incorporation, using a statistical average of three POSS units per hard block, demonstrated one-way shape memory with excellent shape fixing capabilities. In vitro degradation of this sample was also investigated during a two month period.

Concern over the instance of non-biodegradable plastics being lost in fragile water systems has prompted the creation of <b>organic,</b> <b>biodegradable</b> lures that retain the flexible, rubbery texture and action of traditional polymer soft plastic lures by tackle manufacturer Berkley. These new baits are based on different polymers, namely polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), instead of the more usual polyvinyl chloride (PVC). There is much controversy in the angling community regarding {{the true nature of}} this new form of organic soft plastic, which has led to the use of such lures being prohibited in some lure-only angling competitions. However, since PVOH is still a synthetic polymer, which at the grades used in the Berkley lures only dissolve in water temperatures above 60°C, claims of biodegradability of this sort of lure are questionable. Companies like Hogy Lures are have also developed soy based, large style, soft plastic lures designed to target trophy class fish.|$|R

40|$|A new {{analytical}} approach utilizing a biofilm reactor (BFR) for rapid online determination of {{biochemical oxygen demand}} (BOD) was proposed and experimentally validated.

The resultant BFR displays a remarkable rate of biodegradation towards {{a wide spectrum of}} organic substrates, capable of degrading over 20 % of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>organic</b> substrates within 100 s. More importantly, the BFR exhibits a superior indiscriminative biodegradation feature, enabling a precise prediction of BOD values of total <b>biodegradable</b> <b>organics</b> based on experimentally determined BOD values from partial degradation processes without a need for on-going calibration. The proposed approach was systematically validated using a range of individual organic substrates, their mixtures, synthetic samples and wastewaters. Highly significant linear correlations between the BFR and the standard BOD 5 methods were obtained from diversified synthetic samples (r = 0. 988, p = 0. 000, n = 45) and wastewaters (r = 0. 983, p = 0. 000, n = 40).

The carbohydrate content was mainly responsible for reversible fouling of the UF membrane compared to protein or dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content. All pre-treatment could effectively reduce these contents and led to improve the UF filterability. Both BAF and SF markedly led to improvement in flux than coagulation processes, and alum gave greater flux than M. oleifera. This was attributed to the effective removal and/or breakdown of high molecular weight (MW) organics by biofilters. BAF led to greater improvement in flux than SF, due to greater breakdown of high MW organics, and this was also confirmed by the attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. Coagulation processes were ineffective in removing biofouling potential components, whereas both biofilters were very effective as shown by the reduction of low MW <b>organics,</b> <b>biodegradable</b> dissolved <b>organic</b> carbon and assimilable organic carbon contents.

As coagulant the <b>organic,</b> <b>biodegradable</b> polymer chitosan has been promoted. Results in this study show that elevated pH, as may be common during cyanobacterial blooms, as well as high alkalinity may hamper the coagulation of chitosan and thus impair its ability to effectively remove positively buoyant cyanobacteria {{from the water}} column.
