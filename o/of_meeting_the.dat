5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} and risk <b>of</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> Huaorani on the ground, the missionaries chose to drop gifts to the Huaorani by fixed-wing aircraft. Their drop technique, developed by Nate Saint, involved flying around the drop location in tight circles while lowering the gift from the plane on a rope. This kept the bundle in roughly {{the same position as}} it approached the ground. On October 6, 1955, Saint made the first drop, releasing a small kettle containing buttons and rock salt. The gift-giving continued during the following weeks, with the missionaries dropping machetes, ribbons, clothing, pots, and various trinkets.|$|E
5|$|In October 1916, the Flanders Flotilla {{was finally}} {{reinforced}} by the German Admiralty with two full torpedo boat flotillas. The transfer of the 3rd and 9th Torpedo Boat Flotillas to Flanders had immediate consequences to {{the balance of power}} in the Dover Strait. Whereas before, the Flanders Flotilla had been equipped with only three large torpedo boats and several of the smaller inferior A-class torpedo boats, they now possessed 23large torpedo boats capable <b>of</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> British Dover Patrol in combat. Due to the lack of large torpedo boats, the Flanders Flotilla had not sortied against the Dover Patrol in several months and as a result British defences were quite lax in the area.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} months, Johnson flew as a night fighter pilot. Using day fighters {{to act as}} night fighters without radar was largely {{unsuccessful}} in intercepting German bombers during The Blitz; Johnson's only action occurred on 22 February 1941 when he damaged a Messerschmitt Bf 110 in Spitfire R6611, QJ-F. A week later, Johnson's squadron was moved to RAF Tangmere on the Channel coast. Johnson was eager to see combat after just 10.40 operational hours and welcomed the prospect <b>of</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> enemy from Tangmere. If the Germans did not resume their assault the Wing {{was to take the}} fight to them.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Rana Bahadur Shah's youth {{had been}} spent in pampered luxury. In 1794 Rana Bahadur came of age, {{and his first}} act was to re-constitute the government, with his uncle, Bahadur Shah, removed from all {{official}} position. In mid 1795, he became infatuated with a Maithili Brahman widow, Kantavati Jha, and married her on the oath of making their illegitimate half-caste son (as per the Hindu law of that time) the heir apparent, by excluding the legitimate heir from his previous marriage. By 1797, {{his relationship with his}} uncle, who was living a retired life, and who wanted to seek refuge in China on the pretext <b>of</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> new emperor, had deteriorated {{to the extent that he}} ordered his imprisonment on 19 February 1797 and his subsequent murder on 23 June 1797. Such acts earned Rana Bahadur notoriety both among courtiers and common people, especially among Brahmins.|$|E
5|$|Normandy {{continued}} to disintegrate into chaos. In 1105, Henry sent his friend Robert Fitzhamon and {{a force of}} knights into the Duchy, apparently to provoke a confrontation with Duke Robert. Fitzhamon was captured, and Henry used this {{as an excuse to}} invade, promising to restore peace and order. Henry had the support of most of the neighbouring counts around Normandy's borders, and King Philip of France was persuaded to remain neutral. Henry occupied western Normandy, and advanced east on Bayeux, where Fitzhamon was held. The city refused to surrender, and Henry besieged it, burning it to the ground. Terrified <b>of</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> same fate, the town of Caen switched sides and surrendered, allowing Henry to advance on Falaise, which he took with some casualties. Henry's campaign stalled, and the King instead began peace discussions with Robert. The negotiations were inconclusive and the fighting dragged on until Christmas, when Henry returned to England.|$|E
