5|$|Hastings {{felt that}} their best chances lay in {{interviewing}} Christopher Addison about his contact with Booth; as Addison was a government minister he could be relied <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the truth. The case of Gruban v Booth opened on 7 May 1917 at the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in front of Mr Justice Coleridge. Patrick Hastings and Hubert Wallington represented Gruban, while Booth was represented by Rigby Swift KC and Douglas Hogg. The trial attracted such public interest that {{on the final day}} the barristers found it physically difficult to get through the crowds surrounding the Law Courts.|$|E
5|$|Another {{noticeable}} {{difference in}} the storyline takes place when Zhou travels with his teenage disciples to visit his friend the Abbot. Instead of Yue wandering behind the temple to battle the magical snake, he stays with Zhou and the Abbot, while the other disciples go off to explore. Zhou watches as the Abbot tests Yue's strength by asking him to move an ornate three-hundred pound copper stove dating from the Han Dynasty. The abbot then lifts a stone floor tile and presents the boy with a large book on military strategy. He goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Yue how he was once a great soldier who fought in campaigns against the Liao and Western Xia empires, but became a monk after the Song agreed to become a vassal of each state. He later {{made a name for}} himself by teaching military skills to youths from the surrounding area. Since he has no heir of his own, the Abbot presents Yue with his own personal spear and instructs him in the proper use of the weapon. Zhou kindly protests the gift at first, but allows Yue to keep it out of friendship.|$|E

5|$|Kelly {{admits to}} some problems, while making excuses for her boyfriend, {{such as his}} busy {{schedule}} and her own moodiness. Beyoncé, however, rolls her eyes at the thin excuses, and assures Kelly that she and Michelle love her and she does not need not to suffer alone. At this, Kelly begins to cry and laugh at the same time. Michelle goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her of the day she confronted her boyfriend {{when she saw him}} browsing through jewelry with another woman. During the last minute of the video, Kelly can seen be seen looking cold and angry as her boyfriend comes home. He arrives apologetic, but she perks up, dangling a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. He smiles and begins to follow her upstairs. In the following scene, he is naked except for a pair of boxers (in some versions, his rear-end is blurred out) and handcuffed to the balcony. With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry. The girls are finally seen walking down the city street, holding hands, as an image of the album cover of Destiny Fulfilled passes by on a city bus.|$|E

Liam says to Charlie that he, Liam, is Drive Shaft, and that nobody knows who the bass player (Charlie) is. He goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Charlie that without the band, Charlie is nothing, which spurs Charlie to use heroin for the first time. Years later, Charlie visits Liam's house in Australia and wants Liam to rejoin Drive Shaft for a {{comeback}} tour. Liam declines, but the band can't do the tour without him. He criticizes Charlie for still using drugs, and Charlie blames Liam for getting him started with drugs. Liam asks Charlie {{to stay with him}} for a few weeks, saying that Sydney has some good rehab programs and that he can get Charlie help. Charlie angrily leaves, saying he has a plane to catch.|$|E

25|$|Énée then rushes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> of the devouring of {{the priest}} Laocoön by a sea serpent, after he had warned the Trojans to burn the horse. Énée {{interpret}}s this {{as a sign of}} the goddess Athene's anger at the sacrilege. Against Cassandre's futile protests, Priam orders the horse to be brought within the city of Troy and placed next to the temple of Pallas Athene. There is a sound of what seems to be the clashing of arms from within the horse, but the Trojans, in their delusion, interpret it as a happy omen. Cassandre has watched the procession in despair, and as the act ends, resigns herself to death beneath the walls of Troy.|$|E

25|$|This elegiac poem {{proposes a}} cure for the love Ovid teaches in the Ars Amatoria, and is {{primarily}} addressed to men. The poem criticizes suicide {{as a means for}} escaping love and, invoking Apollo, goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> lovers not to procrastinate and be lazy in dealing with love. Lovers are taught to avoid their partners, not perform magic, see their lover unprepared, take other lovers, and never be jealous. Old letters should be burned and the lover's family avoided. The poem throughout presents Ovid as a doctor and utilizes medical imagery. Some have interpreted this poem as the close of Ovid's didactic cycle of love poetry and the end of his erotic elegiac project.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{original}} Call of Juarez, {{there have been}} three further games in the series, all developed by Techland and published by Ubisoft. The first, , was released in 2009 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows. Set roughly twenty years prior to the events of {{the original}} game, Bound in Blood focuses on the exploits of the McCall brothers. Opening {{towards the end of the}} American Civil War in 1864, the game begins with Ray and Thomas fighting for the Confederate States Army against the Union Army during the Atlanta Campaign. After abandoning their post to try to save their family home, they become outlaws, accompanied by their brother William. The game goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the story of how the brothers first encounter Juan Mendoza and Marisa, finding the Gold of Juarez, and ultimately causing William's death. The game ends two years after it begins, with Ray becoming a priest and marrying Thomas and Marisa, who is pregnant with Mendoza's son. It received mainly positive reviews.|$|E

40|$|What {{characteristics}} distinguish liars from truth-tellers? Recent {{research has}} explored "when" and "why" people lie. Yet {{little is known}} about "who" lies. Previous studies have led to mixed results about the effect of gender on deception, and they have largely neglected the role of other characteristics, such as age and level of education. <b>To</b> shed light <b>on</b> these questions, here I report a meta-analysis of 6, 508 distinct observations, collected in 50 Deception Game treatments, by 6 research groups. I find that: (i) males are more likely than females <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> black lies; (ii) males are more likely than females <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> altruistic white lies; (iii) males are (marginally) more likely than females <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Pareto white lies; (iv) age has no effect <b>on</b> the decision <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> black lies; (v) age has no effect <b>on</b> the decision <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> altruistic white lies; (vi) age has no effect <b>on</b> the decision <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Pareto white lies; (vii) educated subjects are more likely than non-educated subjects <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> black lies; (viii) the level of education has no effect <b>on</b> the decision <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> altruistic white lies; (ix) educated subjects are more likely than non-educated subjects <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Pareto white lies.

25|$|Apart of {{the court}} order, NBC News also {{reported}} one former Penn State assistant coach witnessed an incident in the late 1970s, and three other coaches —who {{have gone on to}} work in pro level and other colleges— allegedly saw inappropriate conduct between Sandusky and boys in the early and mid-1990s. Risk management expert Raymond Williams identified both the three incidents with some of the assistant coaches on the Penn State staff at the time, and three others that were reported to university officials; and whether key university officials should have had knowledge about child sex-assault allegations involving Sandusky in each of the six different cases dating to 1976. Mike McQueary claimed former fellow Penn State assistant coaches Greg Schiano and Tom Bradley also knew about Sandusky’s transgressions in a key testimony in a deposition among the documents related to the insurance coverage case, in which he claims that when he told Bradley about what he had seen, Bradley was not shocked, and that Bradley went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him a story about a time Schiano had witnessed Sandusky abusing a child some time during the ‘90s. Both of the former Penn State assistants have denied McQueary's testimony.|$|E
25|$|Horthy's {{attitude}} to Hitler was ambivalent. On one hand, Hungary was a revisionist state {{that refused to}} accept the frontiers imposed by the Treaty of Trianon. Furthermore, the three states with which Hungary had territorial disputes, namely Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania, were all allies of France, so a German-Hungarian alliance seemed logical. On the other hand, Admiral Horthy was a good navalist who believed that sea power was {{the most important factor in}} war. He felt that Britain, as the world's greatest sea power, would inevitably defeat Germany should another war begin. During a meeting with Hitler in 1935, Horthy was well pleased that Hitler informed him that he wanted Germany and Hungary to partition Czechoslovakia, but Horthy went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Hitler that he must careful not to do anything that might cause an Anglo–German war, because British sea power would sooner or later cause the defeat of the Reich. Horthy was always torn between his belief that an alliance with Germany was the only means that could enable him to revise Trianon and his belief that war against the international order could only end in defeat.|$|E
25|$|In {{collecting}} his testimony, Kennedy realised {{that women}} were being treated as badly as children and widened his scope to include them as well. Kennedy visited the area of Little Lever and interviewed several women and children working in the pits. The women lived in Outwood and were employed by Thomas Fletcher. Fletcher owned both Ladyshore and Outwood Collieries and the women moved from one pit to another {{depending on how much}} coal was being produced. Their testimonies showed that children as young as 5 or 6 were working in the pits. Married and mothers, Betty Wardle and Mary Hardman gave damning testimony to conditions underground. Wardle told Kennedy she started work at the age of 6 whilst Hardman said she started at the age of 7. Wardle later described how she was employed to 'draw with belt and chain'; that is pull the tubs along the underground rails by means of a leather waist belt to the back of which was attached a chain to the tub, used where the tunnels were too small for the use of ponies, (ponies were not used at Outwood, so this must refer to Ladyshore). She then went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Kennedy that she was forced to work whilst pregnant and that she had one child of her four in the mine, the work had brought on labour and the newborn was carried out of the mine in her skirt.|$|E
