Me and Juliet premiered in 1953 and was not considered a success, although it ran for much of a year <b>on</b> <b>Broadway</b> <b>and</b> returned a small profit to its backers.|$|E

5|$|South Pacific is {{a musical}} {{composed}} by Richard Rodgers, with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and book by Hammerstein and Joshua Logan. The work premiered in 1949 <b>on</b> <b>Broadway</b> <b>and</b> {{was an immediate}} hit, running for 1,925 performances. The plot of the musical is based on James A. Michener's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1947 book Tales of the South Pacific and combines elements of several of those stories. Rodgers and Hammerstein believed they could write a musical based on Michener's work that would be financially successful and, at the same time, would send a strong progressive message on racism.|$|E
5|$|When NY43 {{was first}} {{assigned}} in the 1920s, it began {{near the village}} of Schoharie and ended in downtown Albany. Initially, the portion of modern NY43 east of Averill Park was designated as part of New York State Route7 in 1924. It was renumbered to New York State Route45 by 1926 and became part of an extended NY43 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY43 was originally routed <b>on</b> <b>Broadway</b> <b>and</b> Washington Avenue in Rensselaer; however, it was rerouted to use 3rd Avenue and US4 instead in the late 1960s.|$|E
5|$|After their {{extraordinary}} early successes, {{beginning with}} Oklahoma! in 1943, Rodgers and Hammerstein had written two musicals in the 1950s {{that did not}} do well and sought a new hit to revive their fortunes. Lee's novel focuses on a father, Wang Chi-yang, a wealthy refugee from China, who clings to traditional values in San Francisco's Chinatown. Rodgers and Hammerstein shifted {{the focus of the}} musical to his son, Wang Ta, who is torn between his Chinese roots and assimilation into American culture. The team hired Gene Kelly to make his debut as a stage director with the musical and scoured the country for a suitable Asian – or at least, plausibly Asian-looking – cast. The musical, much more light-hearted than Lee's novel, was profitable <b>on</b> <b>Broadway</b> <b>and</b> was followed by a national tour.|$|E

Savage agency sent Calleia to Denver, where he made his stage debut singing in the chorus of the musical comedy, Have a Heart. The following season he had a bit part in Pietro (1920), an Otis Skinner vehicle that played six weeks <b>on</b> <b>Broadway</b> <b>and</b> 40 weeks on tour.

5|$|Holtzmann {{initially}} wanted Cole Porter {{to write}} the score, but he declined. She was going to approach Noël Coward next, but happened to meet Dorothy Hammerstein (Oscar's wife) in Manhattan. Holtzmann told Dorothy Hammerstein that she wanted Rodgers and Hammerstein to create a show for Lawrence, {{and asked her to}} see that her husband read a book that Holtzmann would send over. In fact, both Dorothy Rodgers and Dorothy Hammerstein had read the novel in 1944 and had urged their husbands to consider it as a possible subject for a musical. Dorothy Hammerstein had known Gertrude Lawrence since 1925, when they had both appeared in André Charlot's London Revue of 1924 <b>on</b> <b>Broadway</b> <b>and</b> on tour in North America.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1981, the Tony Award-winning musical Dreamgirls {{opened at}} the Imperial Theatre <b>on</b> <b>Broadway</b> <b>and</b> ran for 1,522 performances. The musical, loosely based {{on the history of}} the Supremes, follows the story of the Dreams, an all-female singing trio from Chicago who become music superstars. Several of the {{characters}} in the play are analogues of real-life Supremes/Motown counterparts, with the story focusing upon the Florence Ballard doppelgänger Effie White. While influenced by the Supremes' and Motown's music, the songs in the play are a broader mix of R/soul and Broadway music. Mary Wilson loved the musical, but Diana Ross was reportedly angered by it and refused to see it.|$|E

5|$|Whale {{was born}} into a large family in Dudley, in the Black Country area of the English West Midlands. He {{discovered}} his artistic talent early on and studied art. With the outbreak of World War I he enlisted in the British Army and became an officer. He was captured by the Germans and during his time as a prisoner of war he realized he was interested in drama. Following his release {{at the end of the}} war he became an actor, set designer and director. His success directing the 1928 play Journey's End led to his move to the US, first to direct the play <b>on</b> <b>Broadway</b> <b>and</b> then to Hollywood, California, to direct films. He lived in Hollywood for the rest of his life, most of that time with his longtime companion, producer David Lewis. Apart from Journey's End (1930), which was released by Tiffany Films, and Hell's Angels (1930), released by United Artists, he directed a dozen films for Universal Pictures between 1931 and 1937, developing a style characterized by the influence of German Expressionism and a highly mobile camera.|$|E
