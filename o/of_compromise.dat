5|$|By {{agreement}} among the Allied nations, in March 1942 the Pacific theatre was divided into two separate commands, {{each with its own}} commander-in-chief. The South West Pacific Area, which included Australia, Indonesia, and the Philippines came under General Douglas MacArthur as supreme commander. Most of the remainder, known as the Pacific Ocean Areas, came under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. There was no overall commander, and no authority capable of resolving competing claims for resources, setting priorities, or shifting resources from one command to the other. Such decisions had to be made on the basis <b>of</b> <b>compromise,</b> cooperation and consensus.|$|E

In time, Edward was anointed by Archbishops Dunstan and Oswald at Kingston upon Thames, most likely in 975.

5|$|Among the Calvinists, {{who also}} {{included}} {{the lower classes}} and their leaders, ministers of common background, disagreements soon developed, based on different views {{in the areas of}} religious and social doctrines. The official split took place in 1562, when two separate churches were officially established: the mainstream Calvinist and the smaller, more reformist, Polish Brethren or Arians. The adherents of the radical wing of the Polish Brethren promoted, often by way of personal example, the ideas of social justice. Many Arians (such as Piotr of Goniądz and Jan Niemojewski) were pacifists opposed to private property, serfdom, state authority and military service; through communal living some had implemented the ideas of shared usage of the land and other property. A major Polish Brethren congregation and center of activities was established in 1569 in Raków near Kielce, and lasted until 1638, when Counter-Reformation had it closed. The notable Sandomierz Agreement of 1570, an act <b>of</b> <b>compromise</b> and cooperation among several Polish Protestant denominations, excluded the Arians, whose more moderate, larger faction {{toward the end of the}} century gained the upper hand within the movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{war effort}} {{was the source}} of {{continued}} disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner <b>of</b> <b>compromise</b> alienated factions {{on both sides of the}} aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.|$|E

5|$|After {{assuming}} the throne, Ivan Vladislav immediately sent a delegation to Basil II, which arrived {{five days after}} the fall of Maglen. In his letter, Ivan Vladislav notified Basil that he had personally murdered Gavril Radomir and had seized all the power in the country and promised Basil deep humility and obedience, an act of submission which some in the nobility supported. After Ivan Vladislav firmly secured his hold on the throne, however, he openly declared to be against any kind <b>of</b> <b>compromise</b> with the Byzantines and quickly began to follow the determined policy of his predecessors against the ongoing Byzantine conquest. Basil II soon understood that Ivan Vladislav's letter was a ruse and plotted a retaliatory action, bribing the kavkhan Theodore, who was in Byzantine captivity, to murder the Bulgarian ruler. Theodore in turn paid a trusted man in Ivan Vladislav's employ to commit the murder, but in the event the assassin actually killed Theodore himself. In the meantime Basil II continued his march, forcing the Bulgarian emperor to retreat to the Albanian mountains, and advanced {{into the heart of the}} Bulgarian state. The Byzantines took the capital Ohrid and burned the imperial palaces; news, however, arrived that Ivan Vladislav had laid siege to Dyrrhachium and that to the south the Bulgarian general Ibatzes had defeated the Byzantine rear army near Bitola. With his supply routes cut, Basil II had to retreat back to Thessalonica leaving a small garrison in Ohrid, which was swiftly retaken by the Bulgarians. Back in his base at Mosynopolis, Basil divided the Byzantine army to harass the areas of Strumitsa and Sofia. In January 1016 the Byzantine emperor returned to Constantinople.|$|E

25|$|Up to 200 {{missiles}} were launched against Iran between 1987 and 1988, killing some 2,000 people. Teheran, Qom and Isfahan became the usual targets. Their poor accuracy, while mostly ineffective {{to conduct a}} major strategic campaign, made of them basically weapons of terror, forcing thousands of refugees out of the main Iranian cities. This exchange of ballistic missiles was indeed known as 'the war of the cities'. The full-scale campaign lasted from 29 February 1988 until April 20, when a truce was agreed by both sides. Iraq, which {{had been looking for}} some kind <b>of</b> <b>compromise</b> gesture from Iran, is largely viewed as the 'winner' by some authors.|$|E

40|$|Node {{compromise}} poses severe {{security threats}} in sensor networks. Unfortunately, existing security designs can address only a small, fixed threshold <b>of</b> <b>compromised</b> nodes; the security protection completely breaks {{down when the}} threshold is exceeded. This paper studies how to achieve resiliency against an increasing number <b>of</b> <b>compromised</b> nodes. To this end, we propose a novel location-based approach where the secret keys are bound to geographic locations, and each node stores a few keys based on its own location. The location-binding property constrains the purposes for which individual keys can be used, and decouples the keys bound to different locations, thus limiting the damages caused by a group <b>of</b> <b>compromised</b> nodes. We illustrate this approach through the problem of report fabrication attacks, where compromised nodes forge non-existent events. We evaluate our approach through extensive analysis, implementation, and simulations, and demonstrate its graceful performance degradation when more and more nodes are compromised. ...|$|R

However, the U.S. refused to do likewise. This was, at least in part, due to fears of compromise; sharing even between the US Navy and Army was restricted. The eventual flow of intercepted and decrypted information was tightly and capriciously controlled. At times, even President Roosevelt did not receive all information from code-breaking activities. There were fears <b>of</b> <b>compromise</b> as a result of poor security after a memo dealing with Magic was found in the desk of Brigadier General Edwin M.

25|$|A {{largely unknown}} Kerry Packer arrived in London in late May 1977. He {{appeared}} on David Frost's The Frost Programme to debate his concept with commentators Jim Laker and Robin Marlar. Marlar's aggressive, indignant interrogation of Packer came unstuck when Packer {{proved to be}} articulate, witty and confident that his vision was {{the way of the}} future. The show significantly raised Packer's profile and converted some to his way of thinking. The main goal of his trip was to meet the game's authorities and reach some type <b>of</b> <b>compromise.</b> He made a canny move by securing Richie Benaud as a consultant. Benaud's standing in the game and his journalistic background helped steer Packer through the politics of the game.|$|E
25|$|Facing the {{potential}} for military action, the Foreign Office sought some sort <b>of</b> <b>compromise.</b> Lord Carrington proposed to his counterpart, Nicanor Costa Méndez, to indulge the workers presence at Leith, given the proper documentation, which could include the stamping of temporary permissions instead of passports, a concession crucial to the Argentine position. The Argentine intention, however, was that the arrival of any of its citizens to South Georgia should follow the procedures agreed on the communications treaty of 1971. Governor Rex Hunt strongly rejected this extension of the agreement, valid only for the Falklands jurisdiction, and raised his concerns to the British government. Costa Mendez left things in a limbo; both countries were then {{on the brink of}} conflict.|$|E
