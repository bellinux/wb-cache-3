5|$|Much of Clock Towers {{plot and}} artistic style are {{inspired}} by the works of Italian horror film director Dario Argento, most notably Phenomena (1985). Director Hifumi Kono loved horror films like this and wanted the game to feel like one. Many of the game's character graphics were digitized from photos <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>people.</b> Jennifer's movements were constructed from a woman in Human's planning division acting out the scenes. Her design was inspired by Jennifer Connelly's character in Phenomena.|$|E
5|$|To make enemies memorable {{on their}} own; Radical Entertainment scripted conversations between the enemy {{characters}} {{that can be}} overheard as the player approaches. Several voice actors provide the audio for the small enemies, including Tom Kenny from Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants. Adding to the game's numerous pop-culture references, the voices and mannerisms {{of some of the}} characters are based upon those <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>people,</b> including Mike Tyson, Mr. T, Jerry Lewis, and Peter Lorre.|$|E
5|$|Greg Glienna did {{not come}} up with the surname Focker; Greg's {{character}} in the original film did not have a last name. The name was written into the script after Jim Carrey {{came up with the idea}} for the Focker surname during a creative session held before he abandoned the project. Once Meet the Parents was submitted for rating evaluation, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) questioned the surname Focker as possibly an expletive and, due to the repetitiveness of the surname throughout the film, the film was in danger of being rated R according to the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system. The filmmakers were asked if they had made up the name or if they can prove that such a name exists. The studio submitted to the MPAA a list <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>people</b> with the surname Focker which ensured that the film retained a PG-13 rating.|$|E

5|$|Kono {{described}} Clock Tower as {{an experimental}} project {{with a small}} budget and staff. His peers believed that a game where the protagonist runs away from the enemy would not work, but he continued on despite these concerns. Due to lack of staffing resources, developer Human Entertainment could not include mouse support and also needed to shrink the map down significantly. Although the graphics are two-dimensional, the mansion is designed within a 3D space. The character graphics in Clock Tower were created by digitizing photographs <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>people,</b> a popular technique of the time. The actress for Jennifer was a woman in Human's planning division. Many of the motions in the game came from her acting, such as hanging from a roof and stumbling in the hallway.|$|E
5|$|To create 2,000 Hun {{soldiers}} {{during the}} Huns' attack sequence, the production team developed crowd simulation software called Attila. This software allows thousands of unique characters to move autonomously. A {{variant of the}} program called Dynasty {{was used in the}} final battle sequence to create a crowd of 3,000 in the Forbidden City. Pixar's photorealistic open API RenderMan was used to render the crowd. Another software developed for this movie was Faux Plane, which was used to add depth to flat two-dimensional painting. Although developed late in production progress, Faux Plane was used in five shots, including the dramatic sequence which features the Great Wall of China, and the final battle sequence when Mulan runs to the Forbidden City. During the scene in which the Chinese are bowing to Mulan, the crowd is a panoramic film <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>people</b> bowing. It was edited into the animated foreground of the scene.|$|E

The show's second season in 1981 focused more on unusual stunts, and was {{cancelled}} in September.|$|E

A recurring adult-oriented cast of Muppets (in a setting known as The Land of Gorch) were featured throughout {{the first season}} of Saturday Night Live. Guest stars {{on some of these}} programs have occasionally had Muppet versions of themselves. It was a regular practice for the first few episodes of The Muppet Show, and ZZ Top, among others, have appeared as Muppet versions of themselves on Sesame Street. Muppet versions <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>people</b> have also appeared in other shows, such as in 30 Rock.|$|E
25|$|It is the allegory The Pilgrim's Progress, written during Bunyan's twelve-year {{imprisonment}} {{although not}} published until 1678 {{six years after}} his release, that made Bunyan's name as an author with its immediate success. It remains the book for which Bunyan is best remembered. The images Bunyan uses in The Pilgrim's Progress are reflections of images from his own world; the strait gate is {{a version of the}} wicket gate at Elstow Abbey church, the Slough of Despond is a reflection of Squitch Fen, a wet and mossy area near his cottage in Harrowden, the Delectable Mountains are an image of the Chiltern Hills surrounding Bedfordshire. Even his characters, like the Evangelist as influenced by John Gifford, are reflections <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
25|$|Greek {{designers}} {{began the}} practice of putting a profile portrait on the obverse of coins. This was initially a symbolic portrait of the patron god or goddess of the city issuing the coin: Athena for Athens, Apollo at Corinth, Demeter at Thebes and so on. Later, heads of heroes of Greek mythology were used, such as Heracles on the coins of Alexander the Great. The first human portraits on coins were those of Persian satraps in Asia Minor. Greek cities in Italy such as Syracuse began to put the heads <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>people</b> on coins in the 4th century BC, as did the Hellenistic successors of Alexander the Great in Egypt, Syria and elsewhere. On the reverse of their coins the Greek cities often put {{a symbol of the}} city: an owl for Athens, a dolphin for Syracuse and so on. The placing of inscriptions on coins also began in Greek times. All these customs were later continued by the Romans.|$|E

25|$|According to this argument, {{the fact}} the Electoral College is made up <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>people</b> instead of mere numbers allows for human {{judgment}} and flexibility to make a decision, if it happens that a candidate dies or becomes legally disabled {{around the time of}} the election. Advocates of the current system argue that human electors would be in a better position to choose a suitable replacement than the general voting public. According to this view, electors could act decisively during the critical time interval between when ballot choices become fixed in state ballots until mid-December when the electors formally cast their ballots. In the election of 1872, losing Liberal Republican candidate Horace Greeley died during this time interval, which resulted in disarray for the Democratic Party, who also supported Greeley, but the Greeley electors were able to split their votes for different alternate candidates. A situation in which the winning candidate died has never happened. In the election of 1912, Vice President Sherman died shortly before the election when it was too late for states to remove his name from their ballots; accordingly, Sherman was listed posthumously, but the eight electoral votes that Sherman would have received were cast instead for Nicholas Murray Butler.|$|E

500|$|The myth of Osiris {{was deeply}} {{influential}} in ancient Egyptian religion and was popular among ordinary people. One {{reason for this}} popularity is the myth's primary religious meaning, which implies that any dead person can reach a pleasant afterlife. Another {{reason is that the}} characters and their emotions are more reminiscent of the lives <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>people</b> than those in most Egyptian myths, making the story more appealing to the general populace. In particular, the myth conveys a [...] "strong sense of family loyalty and devotion", as the Egyptologist J. Gwyn Griffiths put it, in the relationships between Osiris, Isis, and Horus.|$|E

500|$|Anderson's {{third and}} {{favourite}} novel {{was her only}} work of historical fiction, The Commandant, published in 1975. Based {{on the story of}} the murder of the infamously brutal penal Commandant, Captain Patrick Logan, which Anderson had initially heard recounted in her childhood, the story is given a [...] "new, partly feminist perspective in that it is centred on the experience of Logan's young sister-in-law." [...] Seventeen-year-old Frances O'Beirne, Letty Logan's sister, travels from Ireland to Moreton Bay Penal Settlement in 1830 to visit her sister. Although Frances is an invented character, most of the other characters are, in fact, based on accounts <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>people</b> from Anderson's extensive primary research. She created Frances to give voice to her own narrative commentary. Anderson once playfully likened the Moreton Bay social climate to Elizabeth Gaskell's Cranford; Susan Sheridan notes that the likeness is particularly true of the discord between the elegant gentility of the middle-class, and the cruelty of the penal colony.|$|E

[...] Miriam Borthwick said [...] "It is a riveting portrayal <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>people's</b> lives lived in terrible circumstances." [...] The Guardian, while generally praising the work was conscious and somewhat wary of the literary reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>real</b> events, concluding that it was [...] "a studiously researched fantasy about the past that stages an almost self-annihilating debate about reconstruction." ...|$|R

500|$|A feature called [...] "Perfect Head", which {{appeared}} in previews of the game but {{was not included in}} the final product, was intended to take customisation of multiplayer profiles further. This feature allowed the player to place a photograph of their choice onto their in-game character's face, via a Game Boy Camera combined with the Nintendo 64 Transfer Pak. The images taken could be manipulated with a simple image editing program to adjust their brightness and position. They could then be saved to either the Nintendo 64 cartridge or a Controller Pak and then loaded onto a player's character in multiplayer, thus creating a virtual representation of the player. Although Rare officially said the feature was dropped due to [...] "technical difficulties", the actual reason was revealed to be [...] "sensitive issues" [...] surrounding the ability to attack images <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>people.</b> Rare's decision came after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.|$|E
500|$|The film's style, {{like that}} of most of Méliès's other films, is {{deliberately}} theatrical. The stage set is highly stylized, recalling {{the traditions of the}} 19th-century stage, and is filmed by a stationary camera, placed to evoke the perspective of an audience member sitting in a theatre. This stylistic choice was one of Méliès's first and biggest innovations. Although he had initially followed the popular trend of the time by making mainly actuality films (short [...] "slice of life" [...] documentary films capturing actual scenes and events for the camera), in his first few years of filming Méliès gradually moved into the far less common genre of fictional narrative films, which he called his scènes composées or [...] "artificially arranged scenes." [...] The new genre was extensively influenced by Méliès's experience in theatre and magic, especially his familiarity with the popular French féerie stage tradition, known for their fantasy plots and spectacular visuals, including lavish scenery and mechanically worked stage effects. In an advertisement he proudly described the difference between his innovative films and the actualities still being made by his contemporaries: [...] "these fantastic and artistic films reproduce stage scenes and create a new genre entirely different from the ordinary cinematographic views <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>people</b> and real streets." ...|$|E
