5000|$|Vaughan Williams {{studied with}} Ravel {{for three weeks}} in Paris in 1908. Though he worked chiefly on orchestration, this was to provide quite a {{contrast}} to the Germanic tradition handed down through Stanford and Parry at the RCM, and perhaps began to give Vaughan Williams a greater sense for colour and a freedom to move chords as block units. His partiality towards mediant relationships, a unifying harmonic motive of A Sea Symphony, may have been somewhat liberated by these studies, and this harmonic relationship is now considered symptomatic of his style in general. A Sea Symphony also makes use of both pentatonic and whole tone scales, now often considered idiomatic features of French music of the period. Almost certainly, this music was in Vaughan Williams’ mind as he finished work on A Sea Symphony in 1908-1909, but Ravel paid him the great compliment of calling him “the only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>students</b> who does not write my music.” ...|$|E

On 9 August 1884, four days after the French bombardment of the Keelung forts, the Canadian missionary George MacKay was invited aboard La Galissonnière in Keelung harbour and met Lespès. MacKay, who was accompanied by a Taiwanese student, was struck by the French admiral's humanity:Four days after the bombardment, in company with an Englishman, I went around the coast in a steamship, and was allowed to go on shore to examine the smoking fortifications. Soldiers were lying on their faces, with bodies shattered. Evidently they had been fleeing when exploded shells ended their lives. These shells were sent with such terrific force as to cut off branches of a tree that were half a foot in diameter. A magazine that had exploded hurled masses of concrete to an incredible distance. The Englishman and myself, with <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>students,</b> were invited on board the flagship La Galissonair and taken through every part of the vessel. When we went down below our attention was directed to three holes, nearly a foot in diameter, just above the surface of the water, made by shells from the Chinese fort. The vice-admiral spoke in the highest terms of the gunners who aimed so truly. Though {{he was a man of}} war, this officer was also a man of sympathy; for when my student looked afraid as the soldiers under drill and their officers dashed to and fro with swords dangling at their sides, he said, 'Poor fellow! Tell him not to be afraid. We have no pleasure in killing people.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Although the Fund {{sponsors}} {{a select}} number of students, it remains active with {{all students in}} these schools, setting up American high school students as pen pals with students at these schools and forming trips to the Dandelion School to teach English. The organization strives to maximize the number of Dandelion students who take annual high school entrance exams and works to ensure that these students will pass. Founder Ted Mooncai wrote of the trip on the organization's website:It {{has long been a}} goal of ours to bring American students on a cultural learning exchange. 2008, it was finally realized.Twelve students from New England took the two-week trip consisting of two parts, touring and teaching. During the first week, we experienced the culture and saw the historic sights in Beijing, Xian, and Luoyang--three different capitals of China's past and present. After visiting the tourist attractions, our group taught English at The Dandelion School and while doing so saw a part of China most travelers rarely experience.Our time at Dandelion was the focus of the trip, with the underlying mission to teach, and be taught. I was confident that despite going to teach, our group would learn a lot about life from their students, and from trip reflections it is very clear that they did. Brendan Wang (Andover High School '11) said, [...] "The experience there is something I will never forget. The kids there are so motivated to learn that if you don’t give it your all you feel as if you’d let them down. Staying in their dormitories really gave me a taste {{of what it was like}} to live their lives. To them the school dormitory was heaven on earth, and to a lot of us it was just about the worst place we’ve ever stayed in."It's easy enough to say that over 20% of the Chinese population is living below the poverty line, but it's something entirely more moving to see, feel, and understand what that poverty means. Through our week at Dandelion, the group got to live next to the worst of conditions and is more globally aware and appreciative as a result. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>students,</b> Jim, let us visit his home to give us a better understanding. From a distance it looked like little more than a pile of bricks covered by branches and tin shingling.Poverty is one of those things you cannot be taught, but must experience to understand.As a pioneering group, I feel the trip was a great success. We had an amazing time experiencing China's culture and successfully prepared 160 Dandelion students for the upcoming school year. It was sad having to leave, and many of our students cried because of how close we had all gotten. Hopefully we will all be able to go back someday soon.|$|E

I am interested in analysing some of the features of The Island’s 15 incarnation then and now, from three different angles: as it is inscribed in the project book, as I remember teaching it and as I observed it recently in a London classroom. I draw on theories of literacy and of the teaching of writing in particular in trying to account for some of the differences but beyond that, I argue that it is essential to link such theories to wider political debates about 20 culture and to reflect back from this to the purposes of the English curriculum and culture of the English classroom.

40|$|All of {{the work}} {{conducted}} {{under the auspices of}} DE-FC 02 - 01 ER 25473 was characterized by exceptionally close collaboration with researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). This included having <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> graduate <b>students</b> - Sarah Williams - spend the summer working with Dr. Ann Almgren a staff scientist in the Center for Computational Sciences and Engineering (CCSE) which {{is a part of the}} National Energy Research Supercomputer Center (NERSC) at LBNL. As a result of this visit Sarah decided to work on a problem suggested by Dr. John Bell the head of CCSE for her PhD thesis, which she finished in June 2007. Writing a PhD thesis while working at <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the University of California (UC) managed DOE laboratories is a long established tradition at the University of California and I have always encouraged <b>my</b> <b>students</b> to consider doing this. For example, in 2000 <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> graduate <b>students</b> - Matthew Williams - finished his PhD thesis while working with Dr. Douglas Kothe at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Matt is now a staff scientist in the Diagnostic Applications Group in the Applied Physics Division at LANL. Another <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> graduate <b>students</b> - Christopher Algieri - who was partially supported with funds from DE-FC 02 - 01 ER 25473 wrote am MS Thesis that analyzed and extended work published by Dr. Phil Colella and his colleagues in 1998. Dr. Colella is the head of the Applied Numerical Algorithms Group (ANAG) in the National Energy Research Supercomputer Center at LBNL and is the lead PI for the APDEC ISIC which was comprised of several National Laboratory research groups and at least five University PI's at five different universities. Chris Algieri is now employed as a staff member in Dr. Bill Collins' research group at LBNL developing computational models for climate change research. Bill Collins was recently hired at LBNL to start and be the Head of the Climate Science Department in the Earth Sciences Division at LBNL. Prior to this he had been a Deputy Section Head at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado. My understanding is that Chris Algieri is the first person that Bill hired after coming to LBNL. The plan is that Chris Algieri will finish his PhD thesis while employed as a staff scientist in Bill's group. Both Sarah and Chris were supported in part with funds from DE-FC 02 - 01 ER 25473. In Sarah's case she received support both while at U. C. Davis (UCD) taking classes and writing an MS thesis and during some of the time she was living in Berkeley, working at LBNL and finishing her PhD thesis. In Chris' case he was at U. C. Davis during the entire time he received support from DE-FC 02 - 01 ER 25473. More specific details of their work are included in the report below. Finally my own research conducted under the auspices of DE-FC 02 - 01 ER 25473 either involved direct collaboration with researchers at LBNL - Phil Colella and Peter Schwartz who is a member of Phil's Applied Numerical Algorithms Group - or was on problems that are closely related to research that has been and continues to be conducted by researchers at LBNL. Specific details of this work can be found below. Finally, I would like to note that the work conducted by <b>my</b> <b>students</b> and me under the auspices of this contract is closely related to work that I have performed with funding from my DOE MICS contract DE-FC 02 - 03 ER 25579 'Development of High-Order Accurate Interface Tracking Algorithms and Improved Constitutive Models for Problems in Continuum Mechanics with Applications to Jetting' and with my CoPI on that grant Professor Greg Miller of the Department of Applied Science at UCD.

When it was played back in the studio, I said I needed to go to the bathroom. There, crying, I just knew I'd just recorded a big, big hit record. You can just tell. It was an amazing time in my life.|$|R

Within a few weeks, {{he came up with}} very nice plots of scattering patterns as well as colorful spatial profiles of scattered fields. As the 3 -D objects were of complicated shapes and my brain is still wired to analytical treatments of scatter-ing, I asked him to repeat his calculations for a sphere made of an isotropic material. After looking at the diagrams he supplied, I decided that something had gone wrong. I then asked him {{to solve the problem of}} scattering by an isotropic sphere analytically, and compare his results with those yielded by the commercial software. For good measure, he was also urged to validate his results against a couple of reference works. 1, 2 His analytical results agreed completely with the reference works, but not with the data from the commercial software. He took another month before the latter came in reasonable agreement with analytical results. The commercial software <b>my</b> <b>student</b> used offers numerous options to the user at the input stage. The options must be correctly chosen in order to get acceptable outputs. As problems gain in complexity, the correct choices may not be the obvious ones. One must therefore confirm not only against results published previously using the same software but also against well-know...|$|R
