40|$|Commonly, an <b>Optical</b> <b>Sorter</b> has a sorting and {{processing}} equipment for particles. Recently, the <b>Optical</b> <b>Sorter</b> is demanded in variousfields {{in order to}} improve food safety or product quality. Therefore, it is desired that the <b>Optical</b> <b>Sorter</b> has high performance to handle widely various material. To solve the issue of the <b>Optical</b> <b>Sorter,</b> a supply mechanism has to be improved to apply to widely various materials, and an efficient sorting mechanism has to be designed {{in order to improve}} the yield in the sorting {{and processing}} line and to increase the production. In this study, the results of a numerical simulation are discussed to develop the <b>Optical</b> <b>Sorter</b> for optimal planning, effective designing, and cost reduction. I have implemented a Distinct Element Method (DEM) simulation code to clarify the behavior of material flow in the supply section of the <b>Optical</b> <b>Sorter.</b> Moreover, I have implemented a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation code to clarify the behavior of the air flow ejected from an ejector nozzle in the sorting section of the <b>Optical</b> <b>Sorter.</b> I have simulated the characteristic events of each section in order to verify the validity of the numerical simulations. Additionally, in this study, due to the productivity development of the <b>Optical</b> <b>Sorter,</b> we propose a product design approach from the viewpoints of social trends, user needs, and user benefits, instead of a conventional approach of engineering design from the viewpoints of only the scientific based result using CAD and CAE. Therefore, I also propose a method of applying the game theory to the multi-purposed trade-off design problem taking into account the economic viewpoint in the productivity development. The game theory can evaluate individual and collective rationality and select an appropriate solution from Pareto-optima of the multi-purposed design problem. In this study, for the purpose of productivity and economic-efficiency improvement of the <b>Optical</b> <b>Sorter,</b> the ejector of the <b>optical</b> <b>sorter</b> is optimally designed. It is required thatthe air pressure is so high using less amount of the air that foreign particles are removed without mistakingly discharging a good particle. Although these requirements are trade-off each other, the air-pressure portion and nozzle height of the ejector is rationally decided using the game theory. 光選別機は粒状物の精選加工装置である。近年、光選別機の需要は、粒状食品の安全や粒状製品の品質を向上させるために、多方面で高まっている。そこで、光選別機のさらなる高性能化、多品種原料対応化が求められている。具体的に、光選別機が克服すべき課題としては、多品種原料に対応できるように原料の供給機構を改善することと、粒状物の精選加工において歩留を上げ、生産高を増やすために効率的な分別機構を設計することである。本研究では、光選別機の開発において最適計画、効果的設計、ランニングコスト低減の観点から、数値シミュレーションを適用することを検討した。まず、光選別機の原料の供給機構における原料の流れを仮想的に再現するため、個別要素法（Distinct Element Method, DEM）に基づいたシミュレーション・コードを作成した。また、光選別機の分別機構であるイジェクターノズルからの噴射エアーを仮想的に再現するため、Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics（SPH）法に基づいたシミュレーション・コードを作成した。これらの数値シミュレーションの妥当性の検証として、それぞれの機構における特徴的な事象を仮想的に再現した。さらに、本研究では、光選別機の製品開発の観点から、CADやCAEの科学的に検討された結果のみに基づいて製品を設計する工学的設計のアプローチだけではなく、経済社会における社会動向、ユーザーニーズ、ユーザー利益などに基づいて製品を設計する生産性・経済性製品設計のアプローチを提案している。そして、製品開発において経済的な視点を加味した多目的最適化設計の取り組みとして、ゲーム理論を適用することを検討した。ゲーム理論は、一般的な多目的設計問題で生じる、複数の目的関数を個別に評価する難しさを個人合理性、共同合理性を満たして評価できることや、複数のパレート最適解の中から一つの最適解を選択する難しさを解決できる手法である。そして、本研究では、光選別機の生産性・経済性向上を目的に、イジェクターのエアー流路機構の最適化を図った。イジェクターの性能として、エアー流量を抑えながらも、噴射エアー圧力を高めることと、エアー抜けを良くして、不良粒だけを除去し、良品の誤除去を防ぐことが求められる。これらの目的は競合関係（トレード・オフの関係）にあるが、ゲーム理論を用いて、イジェクターの圧縮部の経路長とノズルの高さを合理的に決定した...|$|E

The present study shows the successful revamping of the Sant Adria` del Beso´s plant pre-treatment line, where a prototypal <b>optical</b> <b>sorter,</b> a wet-crusher, and a hydrocyclone-decanter substituted the previous pulper and decanter system.

The high methane yield of the digester, between 480 and 580 CHmtVS, together with an energy efficiency index of 2. 2 kWh/kWh, demonstrated the viability of this novel configuration with respect to conventional ones.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of color sorting on reducing aflatoxin levels in shelled apricot kernels was assessed. Naturally-contaminated kernels were submitted to an electronic <b>optical</b> <b>sorter</b> or blanched, peeled, and manually sorted to visually identify and sort discolored kernels (dark and spotted) from healthy ones. The samples {{obtained from the}} two sorting approaches were ground, homogenized, and analysed by HPLC-FLD for their aflatoxin content. A mass balance approach {{was used to measure}} the distribution of aflatoxins in the collected fractions. Aflatoxin B 1 and B 2 were identified and quantitated in all collected fractions at levels ranging from 1. 7 to 22, 451. 5 µg/kg of AFB 1 + AFB 2, whereas AFG 1 and AFG 2 were not detected. Excellent results were obtained by manual sorting of peeled kernels since the removal of discolored kernels (2. 6 %– 19. 9 % of total peeled kernels) removed 97. 3 %– 99. 5 % of total aflatoxins. The combination of peeling and visual/manual separation of discolored kernels is a feasible strategy to remove 97 %– 99 % of aflatoxins accumulated in naturally-contaminated samples. Electronic <b>optical</b> <b>sorter</b> gave highly variable results since the amount of AFB 1 + AFB 2 measured in rejected fractions (15 %– 18 % of total kernels) ranged from 13 % to 59 % of total aflatoxins. An improved immunoaffinity-based HPLC-FLD method having low limits of detection for the four aflatoxins (0. 01 – 0. 05 µg/kg) was developed and used to monitor the occurrence of aflatoxins in 47 commercial products containing apricot kernels and/or almonds commercialized in Italy. Low aflatoxin levels were found in 38 % of the tested samples and ranged from 0. 06 to 1. 50 μg/kg for AFB 1 and from 0. 06 to 1. 79 μg/kg for total aflatoxins...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. White corn {{grown in}} {{southern}} Texas was collected for characterization {{and evaluation of}} the feasibility of sorting kernels containing mycotoxins. Kernels were grouped into one of six symptom categories depending {{on the degree of}} visible discoloration and bright green‐yellow fluorescence (BGYF) or bright orange fluorescence (BOF). Kernels visibly discolored (25 % of their surface) and having BGYF contained over 57 % of the aflatoxin. However, kernels approximately 50 % discolored without BGYF contained over 35 % of the aflatoxin. Over 33 % of the fumonisin was found in kernels that were visibly discolored and had BOF. The remaining fumonisin was in asymptomatic kernels at low levels. Sorting tests for removing mycotoxin‐contaminated kernels were performed using a dual wavelength high‐speed commercial sorter. In one pass through the sorter, aflatoxin was reduced by an average of 46 %, and fumonisin was reduced by 57 % while removing 4 % to 9 % of the corn. Re‐sorting accepted kernels a second time resulted in an 88 % reduction in aflatoxin while removing approximately 13 % of the corn. Approximately half of the aflatoxin missed by the <b>optical</b> <b>sorter</b> was found in larger kernels showing BGYF but no other symptoms, with the remaining aflatoxin in smaller kernels where the germ was damaged by insect feeding...|$|E

It is known that the distribution of particles fed to the sorter will affect both of these. When different particles are in close proximity, they can be ‘‘agglomerated’’ or seen as a single particle during identification and also have an increased probability of being unintentionally co-ejected. Both factors will {{have a negative effect on}} separation efficiency. The aim of this work was to model the air ejection manifold of a sensor-based automated sorter and to investigate the relationship between particle proximity and unintentional co-ejections. The airflow from a single air ejection valve of a sorter was modelled using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software and calibrated against a Tomra Sorting Solutions <b>optical</b> <b>sorter.</b> It was found that the air ejection manifold could be accurately represented in CFD code. Particles were modelled using the discrete element method (DEM) software and the effect of particle position, relative to an air ejection valve, on accurate ejection was examined using an integrated CFD–DEM model. The results of these models matched reasonably well with physical measurements. The models created can be used as a basis for the prediction of sorter efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Risk {{analysis}} is {{an approach that}} guides efforts to reduce foodborne disease risk through the distinct activities of risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication. In three projects, I improve two categories of risk analysis tools for two distinct food safety risks in two distinct geographic regions: risk assessment of the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes in the United States and risk management of the mycotoxins aflatoxin and fumonisin in Kenya. First, I use quantitative microbial risk assessment to show increasing high temperature, short time (HTST) pasteurization temperatures {{to respond to a}} bioterror threat would increase the risk of listeriosis from consuming pasteurized fluid milk. I incorporate experimental findings that increased HTST pasteurization temperatures (from 72 °C to 82 °C) increase outgrowth of L. monocytogenes following post-pasteurization contamination of fluid milk. Conservative estimates show annual listeriosis deaths would increase from 18 to 670, a 38 -fold increase, if all U. S. fluid milk were pasteurized at the higher temperature. Second, I apply whole genome sequence technology to identify which repeatedly observed strains of L. monocytogenes are more likely persistent within individual delicatessens or are repeatedly reintroduced from outside sources. Phylogenetic analyses of whole genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distinguish populations of L. monocytogenes that are identical by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Isolates of persistent strains most often differ by less than 10 individual SNPs and diverge from a most recent common ancestor within the plausible lifetime of the delis. Third, I adapt a multi-spectral <b>optical</b> <b>sorter</b> to remove individual maize kernels that are contaminated with aflatoxin above 10 ppb or fumonisin above 1, 000 ppb from maize samples collected from open air markets in Eastern Kenya. Sorting kernels by linear discriminant analysis achieved an 83. 3 % and 83. 7 % mean reduction in aflatoxin and fumonisin, respectively, while removing 0 to 25 % of a maize sample. The technology has the potential to empower Kenyan maize consumers to manage mycotoxin exposure while subjecting them to minimal food losses. My dissertation reports improved quantitative tools and techniques to assess and manage microbial food safety risks. Improved risk analysis tools will allow for more efficient, efficacious interventions to improve food safety. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|E

The precise optical sorting of many bulk solids is still difficult due to the great technical effort necessary for transport and flow control. In this study, particle separation with an automated <b>optical</b> belt <b>sorter</b> is modeled numerically. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to model the sorter and calculate the particle movement as well as particle – particle and particle – wall interactions. The particle ejection stage with air valves is described {{with the help of}} a MATLAB script utilizing particle movement information obtained with the DEM. Two models for predicting the particle movement between the detection and separation phase are implemented and compared. In the first model, it is assumed that the particles are moving with belt velocity and without any cross movements and a conventional line scan camera is used for particle detection. In the second model, a more sophisticated approach is employed where the particle motion is predicted with an area scan camera combined with a tracking algorithm. In addition, the influence of different operating parameters like particle shape or conveyor belt length on the separation quality of the system is investigated. Results show that numerical simulations can offer detailed insight into the operation performance of <b>optical</b> <b>sorters</b> and help to optimize operating parameters.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common molds that infects the seeds of small cereals worldwide, such as wheat, is Fusarium Head Blight (FHB). The mycotoxin, {{deoxynivalenol}} (also known as DON or vomitoxin) is often produced by this mold, which, upon ingestion, causes health problems to not only livestock (especially non-ruminants), but to humans as well.

Intrinsic differences (size, refractive index) between native (unlabeled) cell populations are utilized for cell sorting. The large difference in size between erythrocytes and lymphocytes results in their successful separation in this beam pattern. The intrinsic differences in size and refractive index of other cells in the study (HL 60 human promyelocytic leukaemic cells, murine bone marrow, and murine stem/progenitor cells) are not large enough to induce passive optical separation.
