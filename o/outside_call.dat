She {{hesitated for a}} moment before the looking-glass, as though {{straightening}} her hat--in reality to give the listener outside time to get back once more into hiding. Then she walked with fast beating heart and steady footsteps towards the door. She opened it boldly. The little hall was empty; the door of the room opposite, which had been closed when she had entered, was ajar now, but there were no signs of any living person. She opened the door leading into the corridor and safety. For the first time she noticed that the key was in the inside. She withdrew it, passed out, closed the door, and stood in safety in the corridor. Thoughts chased one another through her mind. She had only to lock the door on the <b>outside,</b> <b>call</b> for help, and the person who had waited with her for Norris Vine's return was caught in a trap. Would there be any advantage in it? Would she be able to clear herself? ...|$|E
50|$|Not all manual {{telephone}} exchanges were non-dialable points. Some were equipped with apparatus which displayed the called number to an operator when an <b>outside</b> <b>call</b> arrived from an automated dial exchange; this panel call indicator or coded-call indicator working {{would have made}} them dialable points from other exchanges, {{despite the absence of}} local dial.|$|E
50|$|This joint-relationship with a {{call center}} who {{represents}} the Dealership has inspired a new term in the Auto Industry called the Hybrid BDC.

5000|$|... {{an attempt}} to call a Palestinian mobile {{telephone}} (Israel, country code +972) by randomly trying 9- (a common code for an outside line from an office PBX), 011- (the overseas call prefix in the North American Numbering Plan) and 7- (on the off-chance a PBX is using it instead of 9- for an outside line). Security tools such as firewalls or fail2ban must therefore be deployed to prevent unauthorised <b>outside</b> <b>call</b> attempts; many VoIP providers also disable overseas calls to all but countries specifically requested as enabled by the subscriber.|$|E
5000|$|Pure is a dystopian novel {{written by}} Julianna Baggott and {{published}} in 2012. The first part of a trilogy, it {{tells the story of}} Pressia and her people, living in a post-apocalyptic world destroyed by nuclear bombs, and Partridge and his people who live inside The Dome, a giant bunker that spared people from the destruction. The people on the <b>outside</b> <b>call</b> the dome-dwellers [...] "pures", untouched by radiation. The people inside the Dome call the outsiders [...] "wretches", considering them less than human. The novel follows Pressia's and Partridge's stories separately, until they unexpectedly meet.|$|E

50|$|Voicemail has {{two main}} modes of operation: {{telephone}} answering and voice messaging. Telephone answering mode answers <b>outside</b> <b>calls</b> {{and takes a}} message from any outside caller (either because the extension was busy or rang no-answer).

Both of these modes are described below.|$|R

Suddenly he saw the handle of his door turned softly--once, and then again. He watched it with fascinated, almost horrified eyes. The door was shaken slightly. A voice from <b>outside</b> <b>called</b> him.|$|R

When it came, 14,000 UFC members remained <b>outside,</b> <b>calling</b> themselves the United Free Church (Continuing). The phrase 'continuing' was used for five years to avoid confusion between the remaining United Free Church and the pre-union Church. It was dropped from the title in 1934. An agreement between the parties avoided the property disputes of the 1900 union.|$|R

The 4 most central logs ("meios" [...] and [...] "mimburas") are united using hard wooden pegs, made of stronger wood than the logs. The [...] "bordos" [...] are then bound to the [...] "mimburas" [...] using more wooden pegs, so they can be more elevated.|$|R

50|$|Catholicism then {{dominated}} Dutch religion {{until the}} early 16th century, when the Protestant Reformation began to form. Early Protestantism {{in the form of}} Lutheranism did not gain much support among the Dutch, but Calvinism, introduced two decades later, did. It began its spread in the Westhoek and the County of Flanders, where secret sermons were held in the <b>outside,</b> <b>called</b> hagenpreken ("hedgerow orations") in Dutch. Gradually discontent among the Dutch grew, and erupted in 1566 with the so-called Beeldenstorm, a surge of iconoclasm, which quickly spread among all Dutch regions and finally resulted in what would become the Dutch revolt.|$|R

A metal tube wrapped fiberglass epoxy composite <b>outside</b> (<b>called</b> “composite tube ” for short) was impacted in its axial direction in the simulation. The key problems about building the model were discussed later. Comparing the simulation and experiment results, we proved the validity of the model. Furthermore, we applied the material type of the composite tube to vehicle longeron, and carried on the simulation of automobile frontal collisions in LS-DYNA. The simulation results showed using the new type composite material could reduce the longeron weight to original 33. 76 % without lowering the safety...|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, Mustafa Skaf (his father) {{was accused}} of {{offering}} a bribe to a prison officer. Mr Skaf allegedly phoned the maximum security facility at 1.30 pm on Wednesday, 22 September 2002, and was put through to a duty officer.

When the officer told him that <b>outside</b> <b>calls</b> had to be booked in advance and approved for set times, Mr Skaf offered to pay $100 to be put through to his son. The officer dismissed the offer and ended the conversation. He immediately called the number from the calling number display and Mustafa Skaf answered.|$|R
