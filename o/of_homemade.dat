25|$|After the English Malt Tax of 1725, most of Scotland's {{distillation}} {{was either}} shut down or forced underground.

500|$|Martin {{writes that}} {{experimental}} pop developed {{at roughly the}} same time as experimental jazz, and that it emerged as [...] "a new kind of avant-garde" [...] made possible by the historical and material circumstances of its time. In the pop and rock music of the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects. Some of the best known examples are Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and Joe Meek's use <b>of</b> <b>homemade</b> electronic sound effects for acts like the Tornados. According to author Mark Brend, Meek's I Hear a New World (1960) predates better-known experimental pop by several years, whereas musicologist Leigh Landy names the American composer Frank Zappa {{as one of the first}} experimental pop musicians.|$|E
500|$|Slay Tracks {{received}} generally positive reviews. Much of {{the initial}} critical reception to Slay Tracks was from zines to whom Kannberg had sent the EP. A review in the San Francisco-based zine Maximum RocknRoll said [...] "Most of the tunes work {{by virtue of their}} eclecticism, freshness, and originality—this is a good one." [...] The zine Conflict called the EP [...] "absolutely perfect." [...] Slay Tracks also received attention from mainstream publications. Robert Christgau of the Village Voice rated Slay Tracks an A-, and selected it as his fourth favorite EP of 1990. Spins review said: [...] "a long stream of noise water is omitted by Pavement. ... What a party!" [...] A reviewer for Option praised the band's lo-fi characteristics and attitude, calling the EP [...] "loose and intentionally lo-fi," [...] and saying [...] "let's hope this Pavement stays cracked." [...] College Music Journals review was also favorable, noting [...] "You're Killing Me" [...] and [...] "She Believes" [...] as highlights, and calling the EP a [...] "deep, intoxicating breath <b>of</b> <b>homemade</b> music from people with tongues in their cheeks and hearts on their sleeves ... the twin engine feedback and fuzz hits dead center with naive [...] melodic balance, and whether that is in spite of or because of the sloppy, one-take feel is inconsequential." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the popular}} {{music of the}} early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and {{engineers}} to freely experiment with musical form, arrangements, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects. Some {{of the best known}} examples are Phil Spector's Wall of Sound production formula and Joe Meek's use <b>of</b> <b>homemade</b> electronics for acts like the Tornados. XTC's Andy Partridge interprets the music of psychedelic groups as a [...] "grown-up" [...] version of children's novelty records, believing that many acts were trying to emulate those records that they grew up with; [...] "They use exactly the same techniques—sped-up bits, slowed-down bits, too much echo, too much reverb, that bit goes backwards. ... There was no transition to be made. You go from things like 'Flying Purple People Eater' to 'I Am the Walrus'. They go hand-in-hand." [...] Music critic Richie Unterberger says that attempts to [...] "pin down" [...] the first psychedelic record are therefore [...] "nearly as elusive as trying to name the first rock & roll record". Some of the [...] "far-fetched claims" [...] include the instrumental [...] "Telstar" [...] (produced by Meek for the Tornados in 1962) and the Dave Clark Five's [...] "massively reverb-laden" [...] "Any Way You Want It" [...] (1964). The first mention of LSD on a rock record was the Gamblers' 1960 surf instrumental [...] "LSD 25". A 1962 single by The Ventures, [...] "The 2000 Pound Bee", issued forth the buzz of a distorted, [...] "fuzztone" [...] guitar, and the quest into [...] "the possibilities of heavy, transistorised distortion" [...] and other effects, like improved reverb and echo began in earnest on London's fertile rock 'n' roll scene. By 1964 fuzztone could be heard on singles by P.J. Proby, and the Beatles had employed feedback in [...] "I Feel Fine", their 6th consecutive No. 1 hit in the UK.|$|E
