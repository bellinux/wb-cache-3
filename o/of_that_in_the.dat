5|$|Frozen premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California, on November 19, 2013, {{and went}} into general {{theatrical}} release on November 27. It was met with strongly positive reviews from critics and audiences; some film critics consider Frozen {{to be the best}} Disney animated feature film since the studio's renaissance era. The film also achieved significant commercial success, earning nearly $1.3 billion in worldwide box office revenue, $400 million <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States and Canada and $247 million in Japan. It ranks as the highest-grossing animated film of all time, the third-highest-grossing original film of all time, the ninth-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing film of 2013, and the third-highest-grossing film in Japan. It was also the highest-earning film with a female director in terms of domestic earnings, until surpassed by Warner Bros.' Wonder Woman. With over 18 million home media sales in 2014, it became the best-selling film {{of the year in the}} United States. By January 2015, Frozen had become the all-time best-selling Blu-ray Disc in the United States.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, {{science fiction}} (sf) {{magazines}} {{had been published}} successfully in North America for over twenty years, but little progress {{had been made in}} establishing British equivalents. The bulk of British sf was published as paperback books, rather than magazines; a situation opposite <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US. Several short-lived magazines had come and gone, {{both before and after the}} war. John Spencer launched four very poor quality juvenile magazines in 1950, which continued into the mid-1950s, while one magazine, New Worlds, had survived since 1946. Since 1939, Atlas, a British publisher, had been producing a reprint edition of Astounding Science Fiction, one of the most well-regarded American sf magazines. During the war the contents had often been cut severely, and the schedule had not been regular, but it was reputed to sell 40,000 copies a month. This was enough to attract the attention of Hamilton & Co., a British publisher looking for new markets.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{the film}} earned $974.8 {{million at the}} {{worldwide}} box office, $317.6 million <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US and $657.2 million elsewhere, which made it the second highest-grossing film in history at the time, {{as well as the}} year's highest-grossing film. , it is the unadjusted twenty-sixth highest-grossing film of all-time and the second highest-grossing Harry Potter film to date after Deathly Hallows - Part 2, which grossed more than $1 billion worldwide. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 55.9 million tickets in the US.|$|E
5|$|The {{steam turbine}} {{section of a}} power plant, the turbine hall, {{generally}} costs about $1/W, and the electrical equipment to feed that power to the grid is about another $1/W. To reach the projected total CAPEX quoted in LIFE documents, this implies that the entire nuclear island has to cost around $4/W for LIFE.2, and just over $2/W for LIFE.3. Modern nuclear plants, benefiting from decades of commercial experience and continuous design work, cost just under $8/W, with approximately half <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nuclear island. LLNL's estimates require LIFE.3 {{to be built in}} 2040 for about half the cost of a fission plant today.|$|E

25|$|All in all, the Government of India spent Rs. 8 1/30million in {{relieving}} 700 {{million units}} (1 unit = relief for 1 person for 1 day) in British India and, in addition, another Rs. 7.2million in relieving 72 million {{units in the}} princely states of Mysore and Hyderabad. Revenue (tax) payments {{to the amount of}} Rs. 6million were either not enforced or postponed until the following year, and charitable donations from Great Britain and the colonies totaled Rs. 8.4million. However, this cost was minuscule per capita; for example, the expenditure incurred in the Bombay Presidency was less than one-fifth <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bihar famine of 187374, which affected a smaller area and did not last as long.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Minnesota, {{prompted}} by the Wisconsin decision {{and the growth of}} painted turtle capture in the 1990s, commissioned quantitative study of the state's painted turtles. After a two-year study, Gamble and Simon found a clear pattern of harvested lakes having half the painted turtle density of off-limits lakes. They also modeled the painted turtles' replacement rate and suggested that unrestricted harvest put the populations in danger of dropping strongly. In 2002, Minnesota forbid new harvesters and limited trap numbers, although harvest did continue by old harvesters. From 2002 to 2005, the most recent recorded, the yearly Minnesota painted turtles harvests were half the average size <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Shaushtatar, king of Mitanni, sacked the Assyrian {{capital of}} Assur {{some time in}} the 15th century during the reign of Nur-ili, and took the silver and golden doors of the royal palace to Washshukanni. This is known from a later Hittite document, the Suppililiuma-Shattiwaza treaty. After the sack of Assur, Assyria may have paid tribute to Mitanni up to the time of Eriba-Adad I (13901366 BC). There is no trace <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Assyrian king lists; {{therefore}} it is probable that Ashur was ruled by a native Assyrian dynasty owing sporadic allegiance to the house of Shaushtatar. While a sometime vassal of Mitanni, the temple of Sin and Shamash was built in Ashur.|$|E
25|$|The volcanoes {{comprising}} the Garibaldi chain are {{adjacent to the}} highly populated southwest portion of British Columbia. Unlike the central Cascade Arc, renewed volcanic activity in the Garibaldi Belt at a single feeder to create stratovolcanoes is not typical. Instead, volcanic activity results {{in the formation of}} volcanic fields. Of the entire Cascade Arc, the Garibaldi chain has the lowest rate of volcanic activity. In the past two million years, the volume of erupted material in the Garibaldi Belt has been less than 10% <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. states of California and Oregon and about 20% of that within the U.S. state of Washington. As a result, the risk of eruptions throughout this part of the Cascade Arc is minor. Individual volcanoes and volcanic fields remain quiet {{for a long period of}} time and certain vents may never erupt again. However, considerable volcanic activity has taken place in the geologically recent past, most notably the explosive eruption that occurred at Mount Meager 2,350years ago.|$|E

25|$|Between 11 March {{and the end}} of June 2011, a {{total of}} ¥684.4 million (US$6 million) was stolen from ATMs and {{convenience}} stores in Fukushima, Miyagi, and Iwate prefectures.

The number of thefts from homes and stores during the same period in those three prefectures stood at 1,233, about 1.5 times the number from the same period in 2010. Of them, 194 were in the nuclear evacuation zone, 19 times the number from 2010. The rumors which had spread immediately after the quake of rampant rapes by armed gangs proved to be false, as reports of sexual assaults actually fell 35.7 percent to 81 cases. Only one sexual assault was reported occurring in one of the evacuee centers. Throughout Japan, there were 51 reported cases of scams or frauds related to the disaster, with losses amounting to around ¥12.6 million (US$112 thousand).|$|E
