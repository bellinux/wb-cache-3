5|$|Abercrombie {{also had}} the option to avoid a pitched battle, instead {{beginning}} siege operations against the French position. His force was large enough {{that he could have}} fully invested the French position and fended <b>off</b> <b>any</b> arriving reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Essex also rose in {{rebellion}} in June {{and the town}} of Colchester was taken by the Royalists. Sir Thomas Fairfax placed it under siege, and Mersea Fort was taken by Parliamentary forces and used to cut <b>off</b> <b>any</b> assistance reaching the town by river. Meanwhile, Parliament defeated the Kentish insurgency at the Battle of Maidstone at the start of June and then sent a force under the command of Colonel Rich to deal with the castles of the Downs.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth and {{his growing}} force then {{continued}} north via Bridgwater, {{where he took}} up residence at Bridgwater Castle (21 June), Glastonbury (22 June) and Shepton Mallet (23 June) in worsening weather. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy captured Monmouth's ships, cutting <b>off</b> <b>any</b> hope of an escape back to the continent. The Royalist forces of Churchill, who was now in Chard, and of Feversham, in Bristol, also received reinforcements who had marched from London.|$|E

5|$|While his {{men were}} {{clearing}} up the remaining German positions, Ingram scouted ahead in search of machine gun nests in the village. He soon located one positioned in a house, which had been firing through the cellar ventilator. Managing to enter the house, he shot the gunner through the ventilator. He fired several more shots into the cellar before rushing {{to the head of}} the cellar stairs. By thus cutting <b>off</b> <b>any</b> means of escape, a further thirty Germans were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Maratha gunners who had feigned death when the British {{advanced}} over their position re-manned their guns {{and began to}} pour cannon fire into {{the rear of the}} 74th and Madras infantry. Wellesley ordered his four sepoy battalions to re-form and ward <b>off</b> <b>any</b> threat from the Maratha infantry and cavalry while the 78th were sent back to retake the Maratha gun line. Wellesley, meanwhile, galloped back to 7th Madras Native Cavalry, which had been held back in reserve to the east, and led a cavalry charge from the opposite direction. The gunners again stood their ground but were eventually driven from their guns and this time it was ensured that all those who remained were dead.|$|E
5|$|Although Lochry {{knew that}} he was in hostile territory, he landed his little {{flotilla}} after two days of nonstop travel because he needed to feed his men and horses. After landing, the Americans cooked fresh buffalo meat for breakfast and cut grass for their horses, apparently not taking proper security precautions. Concealed in the nearby woods, Brant repositioned his men and then opened fire, taking the Americans completely by surprise. Some Americans fought until their ammunition ran out, although others apparently did not have their weapons ready when the attack began. Some of the Americans attempted to escape by boat, but Brant had anticipated this and had positioned men in canoes to cut <b>off</b> <b>any</b> retreat. Seeing that he was hopelessly trapped, Lochry called for his men to surrender.|$|E

5|$|As the American {{troops were}} {{attempting}} to destroy Shōji's force, Vandegrift ordered Carlson's raiders to march overland from Aola Bay toward Koli Point to cut <b>off</b> <b>any</b> of Shōji's forces that escaped the encirclement attempt. On 5 November, two transport ships headed for Espiritu Santo to pick up three companies from Carlson's battalion while Carlson prepared his two companies already on Guadalcanal to march overland towards Koli Point. Carlson arranged for rear echelon personnel at Aola to resupply his patrol with rations every four days at a prearranged point on the coast. A patrol with native carriers would meet the boat and manpack the supplies inland to Carlson's patrol base.|$|E
5|$|Further Japanese attacks {{near the}} Matanikau on 26 October by Oka's 124th Infantry Regiment were also repulsed with heavy losses for the Japanese. Thus, at 08:00 on 26 October, Hyakutake called <b>off</b> <b>any</b> further attacks and ordered his forces to retreat. About half of Maruyama's {{survivors}} {{were ordered to}} retreat back to the area west of the Matanikau River while the rest, the 230th Infantry Regiment under Colonel Toshinari Shoji, was told to head for Koli Point, east of the Lunga perimeter. The 4th Infantry Regiment retreated back to positions west of the Matanikau and around the Point Cruz area while the 124th Infantry Regiment took up positions {{on the slopes of}} Mount Austen in the upper Matanikau Valley.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack was}} {{to be part of}} a coordinated pincer {{movement}} against the airfields. Ju 88s from II./KG 76 were to dive-bomb buildings and hangars from high-altitude first. Five minutes later, 27 Do 17s from I. and II./KG 76 would level-bomb from high altitude to crater the runways and landing grounds while knocking out its defences. 9 Staffel KG 76, the specialist low-level strike unit, would go in and finish <b>off</b> <b>any</b> buildings still standing. It was a bold and imaginative plan. If it worked, it would wreck Kenley from end-to-end. The high-flying bombers would have full fighter escort but the low-flying bombers would have to use stealth to avoid interception to and from the target area. The operation began at 09:00 but was postponed because of heavy haze reducing visibility up to 4,000 feet.|$|E

5|$|At 02:30 on 26 March, the {{regiment}} {{set out from}} Dier El Belah towards Gaza. The division was to circle the town, cutting <b>off</b> <b>any</b> escape route east and provide a blocking force to stop Turkish reinforcements, while the 53rd (Welsh) Division and a brigade of the 54th (East Anglian) Division carried out a frontal assault. Positioned at the Humra mound in the east with the 4th and 11th Squadrons, {{the regiment}} was assigned to watch for Turkish reinforcement coming from Huj. The main attack was not progressing well, so the brigade, {{along with the rest}} of the division, was ordered to attack Gaza. Still watching out for Turkish reinforcements, the regiment was held in reserve. The brigade had made good progress and was inside the town when it was ordered to withdraw. Less the 4th Squadron, which was the division's rearguard, the regiment had returned to Dier El Belah by early the next day.|$|E
5|$|For the {{following}} 19 months, the club played games away from Valley Parade. Cherry {{and the players}} became a close-knit team, attending funerals of the victims and other engagements {{in the months that}} followed, and the club's 13th place finish in Division Two in 1985–86 was hailed a major achievement. During Bradford's time away from Valley Parade, McCall also turned his back on Leeds United, the team he had supported as a child, after their fans set fire to a chip van at Odsal Stadium. McCall became club captain in November 1986, aged just 21, after Peter Jackson moved to Newcastle United. Under Cherry's replacement, Terry Dolan, the club held <b>off</b> <b>any</b> relegation threats to finish tenth in 1986–87. Like Jackson, McCall and Hendrie were both keen to move to a Division One club, but they agreed in 1987 to stay for one final season.|$|E
5|$|In 1525 Dudley married Guildford's {{daughter}} Jane, who {{was four}} years his junior and his former classmate. The Dudleys belonged to the new evangelical circles of the early 1530s, and their 13 children were educated in Renaissance humanism and science. Sir Edward Guildford died in 1534 without a written will. His only son having predeceased him, Guildford's nephew, John Guildford, asserted that his uncle had intended him to inherit. Dudley and his wife contested this claim. The parties went to court and Dudley, who had secured Thomas Cromwell's patronage, won the case. In 1532 he lent his cousin, John Sutton, 3rd Baron Dudley, over ₤7,000 on {{the security of the}} baronial estate. Lord Dudley was unable to pay <b>off</b> <b>any</b> of his creditors, so when the mortgage was foreclosed in the late 1530s Sir John Dudley came into possession of Dudley Castle.|$|E

5|$|In April 1951 Justice Simpson {{advised the}} Minister for Civil Aviation that new {{evidence}} had become available. The Minister gave permission for the Inquiry to be re-opened. The Inquiry re-opened in Melbourne on 4 June 1951. The Department of Civil Aviation had recently completed {{tests on the}} DC-4 fuel system. The tests showed that when an engine boost pump was operating, a vortex in the engine fuel tank prevented water from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump was turned <b>off,</b> <b>any</b> water would soon {{find its way into}} the engine. The Department of Civil Aviation believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off. However, Justice Simpson stated that the re-opened Inquiry served only to confirm his view that the Amana's loss of power was not due to water in the fuel.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the invasion, the Athenians began rebuilding their city under the guidance of Themistocles. They wished to restore the fortifications of Athens, but the Spartans objected on the grounds that no place north of the Isthmus should be left that the Persians could use as a fortress. Themistocles urged the citizens to build the fortifications as quickly as possible, then went to Sparta as an ambassador to answer the charges levelled by the Spartans. There, he assured them that no building work was on-going, and urged them to send emissaries to Athens to see for themselves. By the time the ambassadors arrived, the Athenians had finished building, and then detained the Spartan ambassadors when they complained about the presence of the fortifications. By delaying in this manner, Themistocles gave the Athenians enough time to fortify the city, and thus ward <b>off</b> <b>any</b> Spartan attack aimed at preventing the re-fortification of Athens. Furthermore, the Spartans were obliged to repatriate Themistocles in order to free their own ambassadors. However, this episode may be seen as the beginning of the Spartan mistrust of Themistocles, which would return to haunt him.|$|E
5|$|Launched on 1 September 1939, the {{invasion}} began successfully. In Army Group South's {{area of responsibility}} under Rundstedt, the 8th, 10th and 14th Armies pursued the retreating Poles. The initial plan was for the 8th Army, the northernmost of the three, to advance towards Łódź. The 10th Army, with its motorised divisions, was to move quickly towards the Vistula, and the 14th Army was to advance and attempt to encircle the Polish troops in the Kraków area. These actions led to the encirclement and defeat of Polish forces in the Radom area on 8–14 September by six German corps. Meanwhile, the German Eighth Army was under attack from the north, so elements of the Fourth, Eighth and Tenth Armies were quickly redeployed with air support in an improvised attempt to cut <b>off</b> <b>any</b> Polish break-out back towards Warsaw. The flexibility and agility of the German forces led to the defeat of nine Polish infantry divisions and other units in the resulting Battle of the Bzura (8–19 September), the largest engagement of the war thus far. The conquest of Poland was quickly over, with the last Polish military units surrendering on 6 October.|$|E

5|$|Pyrrhus was {{receptive}} to Cleonymus' appeals to install {{him on the}} Spartan throne and agreed to assist him. To achieve this, the Epiriote King assembled an army numbering of 27,000 men. It consisted 25,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and was supplemented by 24 war elephants. The size of Pyrrhus' expedition indicates that he viewed aiding Cleonymus {{as an opportunity to}} extend his hegemony into the Peloponnese and securing Sparta as an ally. An alternate theory is that Pyrrhus undertook his invasion of the Peloponnese as a means of cutting <b>off</b> <b>any</b> support that Antigonus was still receiving from the southern Greek poleis. After mustering his force, Pyrrhus marched south through central Greece and through to the Peloponnese. N. G. L. Hammond speculates that Pyrrhus' army marched down to Pleuron on the Aetolian side of the Gulf of Corinth and crossed from there into the Peloponnese. This suggests that the invasion was facilitated by the Aetolian League, a power confederate in Central Greece, which was hostile to Antigonus.|$|E
5|$|Squads {{from the}} larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a {{position}} at the pit number three coal shed; another, at the pump house. A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown. They warned the Chinese they had one hour {{to pack up and}} leave town. After only 30 minutes, the first gunshots were fired by the squad at the pump house, followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot and fell to the ground. As the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went. The smaller group of white miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut <b>off</b> <b>any</b> Chinese escape.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Lone Pine (also {{known as}} the Battle of Kanlı Sırt) was fought between Australian and Ottoman Empire forces during the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War, between 6 and 10 August 1915. The battle {{was part of a}} diversionary attack to draw Ottoman {{attention}} away from the main assaults against Sari Bair, Chunuk Bair and Hill 971, which became {{known as the}} August Offensive. The Australians, initially at brigade strength, managed to capture the main Ottoman trench line from the battalion that was defending the position in the first few hours of the fighting; however, the fighting continued for the next three days as the Ottomans brought up reinforcements and launched numerous counterattacks in an attempt to recapture the ground they had lost. As the counterattacks intensified the Australians brought up two fresh battalions. Finally, on 9 August the Ottomans called <b>off</b> <b>any</b> further attempts and by 10 August offensive action ceased, leaving the Australians in control of the position. Nevertheless, despite the Australian victory, the wider August Offensive of which the attack had been a part failed and a situation of stalemate developed around Lone Pine which lasted {{until the end of the}} campaign in December 1915 when Allied troops were evacuated from the peninsula.|$|E
