By 1997, {{the federal government had}} already cut tariffs to 22.5percent, from 57.5percent ten years earlier; by 2000, a plan was formulated to reduce the tariffs to 15percent. Holden was critical, saying that Australia's population was not large enough, and that the changes could tarnish the local industry.|$|E

Higher molecular weight HES {{can be used as}} blood exchange in surgery which resulted in better haemodynamic function but affected in kidney function. Methods: The researcher used retrospective observational analytic with cross sectional study. Data are secondary data which is divided into two groups and each group consist of 23 patients. First group were given HES 40 kD and second group were given HES 200 kD. Total urine <b>output</b> <b>volume</b> was summed in the entire surgery. Data were analyzed by using SPSS 11. 5 for windows. Result: In this study, {{there was no difference in}} urine <b>output</b> <b>volume</b> between HES 40 kD and 200 kD. There was no significant difference between two groups (p = 209; p < 0, 05).

5000|$|Stride {{controls}} how depth columns {{around the}} spatial dimensions (width and height) are allocated. When the stride is 1 then we move the filters one pixel at a time. This leads to heavily overlapping receptive fields between the columns, {{and also to}} large <b>output</b> <b>volumes.</b> When the stride is 2 (or rarely 3 or more) then the filters jump 2 pixels at a time as they slide around. The receptive fields overlap less and the resulting output volume has smaller spatial dimensions.|$|E

50|$|We {{note that}} the {{productivity}} model reports a 1.4% productivity growth from the same production data. The difference (1.4% versus 1.5%) {{is caused by the}} different production volume used in the models. In the productivity model the input volume is used as a production volume measure giving the growth rate 1.063. In this case productivity is defined as follows: <b>output</b> <b>volume</b> per one unit of input volume. In the growth accounting model the <b>output</b> <b>volume</b> is used as a production volume measure giving the growth rate 1.078. In this case productivity is defined as follows: input consumption per one unit of <b>output</b> <b>volume.</b> The case can be verified easily with the aid of productivity model using output as a production volume.|$|R
50|$|After rills begin forming, {{they are}} {{subjected}} to variety of other erosional forces which may increase their size and <b>output</b> <b>volume.</b> Up to 37% of erosion in a rill-ridden area may derive from mass movement, or collapse, of rill sidewalls. As water flows through a rill, it will undercut into the walls, triggering collapse. Also, as water seeps into the soil of the walls, they weaken, amplifying the chance of wall collapse. The erosion created by these forces increases {{the size of the}} rill while also swelling its <b>output</b> <b>volume.</b>|$|R

50|$|Lystek {{developed}} a biosolids treatment that improves {{the operation of}} wastewater treatment plants by producing more biogas, while reducing <b>output</b> <b>volumes,</b> odors and greenhouse gas emissions. Lystek's technology uses thermal hydrolysis involving high speed shearing, alkali addition and low temperature steam to produce biofertilizer. The product can be sold as a commercial biofertilizer called LysteGro or recycled to anaerobic digesters and biological nutrient removal (BNR) systems for optimization of the wastewater treatment plant operation. The Lystek process condition disintegrates microbial cell wall/membranes and hydrolyzes complex macromolecules into simpler compounds. Recycling up to 25% of the product to the digester increases biogas yields by greater than 30 % and enhances biodegradation, reducing output of biosolids by at least 20%.|$|E

50|$|Model {{verification}} {{is achieved}} by obtaining output data from the model and comparing them to what is expected from the input data. For example, in traffic simulation, traffic volume can be verified to ensure that actual volume throughput in the model is reasonably close to traffic volumes input into the model. Ten percent is a typical threshold used in traffic simulation to determine if <b>output</b> <b>volumes</b> are reasonably close to input volumes. Simulation models handle model inputs in different ways so traffic that enters the network, for example, {{may or may not}} reach its desired destination. Additionally, traffic that wants to enter the network may not be able to, if congestion exists. This is why model verification is {{a very important part of}} the modeling process.|$|E

5000|$|Peugeot’s 402 was a rival to the Dauphine, {{but also}} {{suggested}} {{a solution of}} sorts. At the 32nd Paris Motor Show in October 1938 Berliet presented a completely rebodied Dauphine, displaying the curved panels that were becoming mainstream for the volume auto-makers, reflecting the switch to pressed steel car bodies. [...] Only four of the rebodied cars were on the Berliet show stand, {{and they were not}} at this stage included in the manufacturer's price lists. [...] Prices were announced on 28 November 1938, although production commenced, at a rather gentle rate, only during the first part of 1939. [...] Berliet's passenger car <b>output</b> <b>volumes</b> did not begin to justify the capital cost for steel presses and dies used to stamp out panels for all-steel car bodies, and for 1939 the manufacturer gave up producing car bodies. [...] The final Berliet Dauphines emerged hiding a Berliet chassis and mechanical elements under the body of a Peugeot 402, albeit with the Peugeot grille replaced by a modern grille designed by Berliet. [...] Although in retrospect the solution appears as a bizarre route to oblivion, Berliet was not the only low volume automaker of midmarket cars to adopt this solution to the cost squeeze associated with the arrival of all-steel car bodies. In the Paris area La Licorne had already launched a range of cars using the body of a Citroën Traction, and across the Rhine bodies produced by Ambi Budd in Berlin for Adler also ended up being sold in relatively small volumes to German competitor auto-makers. Berliet’s own Peugeot bodied Dauphine, launched in March 1939 at the Lyon Trade Fair, arrived {{just in time for the}} outbreak of war. Barely 200 were produced, and many of these were simply painted khaki and sold to the French army.|$|E

The convex hull (minimal uplift) pricing method results in power prices minimizing the total uplift payments to generators, which compensate their potential profits lost by accepting centralized dispatch solution, treating as foregone all opportunities to supply any other output volume allowed by generator internal constraints.

It then considers the domestic legislative and international governance framework within which GM products are commercialised, highlighting the current conflict between the precautionary EU and the 'substantially equivalent' US approaches to risk assessment. We argue that these fundamentally different approaches are likely to seriously impede attempts to derive global standards for the commercialisation of GM crops and foodstuffs...|$|E

50|$|A Pro-Logic decoder {{also uses}} Steering Logic, which drives amplifiers, to raise or lower the <b>output</b> <b>volume</b> of each channel {{based on the}} current {{dominant}} sound direction. For example, while a mono signal is played, the strong correlation to the center channel triggers the <b>output</b> <b>volume</b> of the left, right and surround channels to be lowered. This increases the channel separation achievable, to around 30 decibels between channels. By careful tuning of {{the response of the}} amplifiers, the total amount of signal energy remains constant and is unaffected by the operation of the channel steering. Additionally the response time of the system to changes in sound direction is important as too fast a response results in a twitchy feel, while too slow a response leaves sounds coming from an inappropriate direction.|$|R
