5|$|England has {{a strong}} {{sporting}} heritage, and during the 19th century codified many sports that are now played around the world. Sports originating in England include association football, cricket, rugby union, rugby league, tennis, boxing, badminton, squash, rounders, hockey, snooker, billiards, darts, table tennis, bowls, netball, thoroughbred horseracing, greyhound racing and fox hunting.

40|$|Two accelerometers {{are used}} to measure the motion <b>of</b> the <b>golf</b> club. The accelerometers are mounted in the shaft <b>of</b> the <b>golf</b> club. Each {{measures}} the acceleration along the axis of the shaft <b>of</b> the <b>golf</b> club. Interpreting the measurement with the context of the double pendulum model <b>of</b> the <b>golf</b> swing, it is useful to resolve the resulting signals into differential and common mode components. The differential mode {{is a measure of the}} rotational kinetic energy <b>of</b> the <b>golf</b> club, and this can be used to understand the tempo, rhythm, and timing <b>of</b> the <b>golf</b> swing. The common mode measurement is related to the motion of the hands. It is shown that both components can be used to recover the motion of the swing within the context of the double pendulum model <b>of</b> the <b>golf</b> swing. Comment: 23 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

5|$|With {{the modern}} game <b>of</b> <b>golf</b> {{originating}} in 15th century Scotland, {{the country is}} promoted as the home <b>of</b> <b>golf.</b> To many golfers the Old Course in the Fife town of St. Andrews, an ancient links course dating to before 1574, is considered a site of pilgrimage. In 1764, the standard 18-hole golf course was created at St Andrews when members modified the course from 22 to 18 holes. The world's oldest golf tournament, and golf's first major, is The Open Championship, which was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club, in Ayrshire, Scotland, with Scottish golfers winning the earliest majors. There are many other famous golf courses in Scotland, including Carnoustie, Gleneagles, Muirfield, and Royal Troon. Other distinctive features of the national sporting culture include the Highland games, curling and shinty. In boxing, Scotland has had 13 world champions, including Ken Buchanan, Benny Lynch and Jim Watt.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 12, she {{switched}} to golf, sharing her first set <b>of</b> <b>golf</b> clubs with her sister—Annika got the odd numbered clubs and Charlotta the even—and earned her first handicap of 54. She was so shy as a junior she used to deliberately three-putt {{at the end of}} a tournament to avoid giving the victory speech. The coaches noticed and at the next tournament both the winner and the runner-up had to give a speech. Sörenstam decided that if she were going to have to face the crowd anyway she might as well win and the deliberate misses stopped.|$|E

5|$|Fleming endowed Bond {{with many}} of his own traits, {{including}} sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries. Bond's tastes are also often taken from Fleming's own as was his behaviour, with Bond's love <b>of</b> <b>golf</b> and gambling mirroring Fleming's own. Fleming used his experiences of his espionage career and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.|$|E
5|$|Habitat destruction, such as forest {{clearing}} {{for commercial}} logging, agriculture space, and residential areas, {{is the most}} detrimental activity {{on the distribution of}} these rabbits. Since they prefer a habitat of both mature and young forests, they do not thrive in only mature forests untouched by destruction, yet they do not thrive in newly growing forests alone, either. There are plans to remove current habitat for these rabbits for the construction <b>of</b> <b>golf</b> courses and resorts, which is allowed because it will not directly be killing the rabbit, just changing the environment where it dwells, which is legal even under the protection of the special natural monument status.|$|E
5|$|In Allegan County, I-196/US31 {{passes a}} pair <b>of</b> <b>golf</b> courses and {{continues}} northward through farm fields.

The two roads trade places again when I-196/US31 turns northeasterly {{on the south side}} of the twin cities of Saugatuck and Douglas. The freeway crosses over a section of Kalamazoo Lake, a wider section of the Kalamazoo River that flows between the two towns. A-2 crosses back to the eastern side of the freeway north of Saugatuck, and I-196/US31 continues north-northeasterly toward Holland.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} Fleming's other Bond stories, {{he used the}} names of people he knew, or knew of, {{throughout}} his story, including the book's eponymous villain, who was named after British architect Ernő Goldfinger. Upon learning {{of the use of}} his name, Goldfinger threatened to sue over the use of the name, before the matter was settled out of court. Fleming had based the actual character on American gold tycoon Charles W. Engelhard, Jr. Fleming also used a number of his own experiences within the book, and the round <b>of</b> <b>golf</b> played with Goldfinger was based upon a tournament in 1957 at the Berkshire Golf Club in which Fleming partnered the Open winner Peter Thomson.|$|E
