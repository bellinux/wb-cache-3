40|$|In {{the complex}} world of {{corporate}} and host-country influences, social interaction between multinational and local actors, including employees, trade unions {{and the local}} society, is the underlying social mechanism through which employment practices are constructed. This focus is a conceptual amendment to the comparative institutionalist perspective on multinationals, integrating actors' values, interests, behaviour, and social interaction within the broader framework of the comparative institutional approach. This book provides an inquiry into the process through which multinational companies establish and reinforce their position in host-country labour markets. A particular {{focus is on the}} construction of employment practices in multinationals' subsidiaries across Western European and post-socialist Central and Eastern European host countries; and the assessment of their diversity across the subsidiaries of the same company. Presenting original empirical evidence gathered in five countries, it is a direct response to recent literature's call for systematic comparative analyses of processes and outcomes of politics inside multinational firms and the relationship between management and employees in a cross-national perspective.

40|$|The {{rights of}} {{refugees}} and {{basic human rights}} are inextricably linked. Today's human rights abuse is tomorrow's refugee movements. Quite often, refugees' rights are curtailed by the same states that declare them in accordance with international and domestic instruments, only because they are non-nationals. While the foundation of refugee rights is the principle that all {{men and women have}} the right to belong to a society in which they are protected by the state, the respect to the principle of non-refoulement {{is at the core of}} being a refugee. Even though the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) proclaims rights to all, including refugees, states use international principles of sovereignty to shut their doors in front of asylum seekers. Furthermore, it is not easy to utilise international mechanisms of protection to instigate complaints against a potential host state, based on its arbitrary act to shut its doors. This is because one needs to seek remedies before authorities of the same country where she or he has been denied. In addition, international law has few precedents on the matter even assuming it was treated as an exception to the former rule. This situation puts refoulement victims in a dilemma. [...] . Since the first time when the wave of asylum seekers from Rwanda hit Tanzania in 1959, the flow of refugees continues. Tanzania has hosted refugees not only from its neighbouring countries, but also as far as from South Africa, Zimbabwe and Somalia. With an estimated number of 602, 00 refugees population in 2004, Tanzania was among the top five refugee-hosting countries in the world. Tanzania ratified the international and regional refugee instrumetns, as well as other human rights instruments that may enhance the protection of refugees. Subsequently, Tanzania enacted appropriate legislation in order to make the refugee instruments enforceable within the national legal framework. The principle of non-refoulement is enshriend in all legal instruments of which Tanzania has an international, regional and national obligation to respect. However, in recent years a trend of sporadic incidents in which the principle of non-refoulement was not respected, has been observed. For instance, in October 2004, 68 Burundian asylum seekers were forced to return to Burundi following the orders of the local authorities. One of the most recent incidents occurred in January 2005 when the government returned two families of nine persons, despite assurances made to UNHCR that they would be granted refugee status. This research looks at the obligation of the Government of Tanzania to protect rights of asylum seekers and refugees. This is in line with the principle of non-refoulement as enshrined under international and regional instruments of which Tanzania ratified. It further explores the role of international communities in responsibility sharing (often referred to in the humanitarian community as 'burden sharing') as a way to ensure that all states respect the principle of non-refoulement. [...] . The first part of this research is the introduction, that is, the background to the problem, problem statement, scope of the research, hypotheses, objective of the research, literature review, research methodology, and <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>chapters.</b> The second chapter looks at the right to non-refoulement under international, regional and national legal instruments. Chapter three deals with respect of the principle of non-refoulement in the refugee operation of Tanzania. Chapter four examines the relationship between the principle of non-refoulement and responsibility sharing with a view to reflect on the role of the international community in promoting refugee rights. The last chapter is the conclusion of the research and recommendations. " [...] Introduction.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of Durban-Westville, 2002. This thesis {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} Outcomes-Based Education (OBE) policy {{in public schools}} in the Empangeni Region. Although South Africa is now a free and democratic country with a new system of education, some inequalities still exist among public schools which make it very difficult for them to implement OBE policy in the same way. It is therefore necessary to evaluate how educators view OBE policy. This research aimed at finding out (a) the policy measures that apply to OBE as a policy, (b) the extent to which normative factors apply in the implementation of education policy, (c) factors that hinder or promote effective implementation of OBE policy in public schools and (d) the model that can be recommended for the effective implementation of OBE policy. For purposes of orientation of the study it had to be located within its background which motivated it. The field of education in South Africa has always experienced problems especially with its policies. Some of these problems motivated the researcher to undertake this study and because of their significance they had to be stated in this research. The statement of the problem provided a foundation within which the aims of the study were explained. The significance of any research cannot be overemphasized. However, this one becomes even more significant because it comes up at a crucial period in South African education. This is a period when policies that were implemented in the country after 1994 should be evaluated. It is true that not all problems that relate to education policy can be solved at once. This therefore necessitated that delimitation of the study be clearly stated. There is virtually no study without its limitations, especially if {{it has to be done}} in public schools. These limitations were stated. For the purposes of clarity the terms that were constantly used in the study were defined and explained. The demarcation of the study provided a clear picture of the <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>chapters.</b> The study had to be contextualized within the existing theoretical and conceptual perspectives that apply to public policy, policy-making process and OBE policy. Theory had to be drawn from different sources to find out whether OBE policy does adhere to the expectations of public policy in general. The policy-making process is one area that plays a very important role in the success of the implementation process. This necessitated that OBE policy be evaluated in terms of whether it followed necessary policy processes before and during its implementation. It also became necessary to present critical viewpoints on OBE policy as understood by its critics. This criticism culminated in the Revised National Curriculum Statement which was also discussed in great details in this study. This study had to outline the research methods and techniques used. The nature of the study necessitated the use of only questionnaires and interview schedule to elicit information from educators. It is true that there is no single research instrument without its limitations. It is for this reason that information obtained through the questionnaire had to be validated through the interview schedule. The researcher presented, analyzed and discussed research findings at the same time. The nature of the study enabled the use of tables and frequency distribution to present data. Because there was a lot of information to analyze, it sufficed to use descriptive statistical analysis. Discussion of data entailed interpretation and integration of data based on its presentation and analysis. In drawing conclusions the researcher realized that the present South African education system still has problems. To obviate these problems recommendations were made to the government, the education department in KZN and schools. This research culminated into a model of implementation which is the researcher's own creation intended to help all stakeholders have a clear direction in the implementation of OBE policy. The researcher did not only experience challenges inherent in the research process but also professional development. This learning experience is discussed as reflections on learning...|$|E

Co-creating drama can best be described as the coming together of teacher and students in a creative enterprise. The experience centres on the notion of the teacher as a co-artist, whereby they enliven qualities of creativity such as a “willingness to play, experiment, be a partner with learners, and to take risks” (Craft 1997, p 89). Co-creating is distinguished by the autonomous behaviour of the students and the artistic act of creating something of value to the group. It resonates distinctly within the theoretical frame of constructivism, as well as with more current inquiries of collaborative and creative drama practices. Classroom drama in an Irish context remains largely under-researched. It is argued that the knowledge base for teacher education should come from the teachers’ experiences in the classroom, but there has yet to be an in-depth study of teachers’ lived experiences of drama education in Ireland. In order to address this, a phenomenological inquiry was conducted into the experiences of teachers cocreating drama, with a view to gaining an in-depth understanding of the experience as perceived by them. Through a series of interventions and interviews, the teachers’ experiences and reflections were explored in order to portray the essence of the phenomenon. The analysis of the interviews has led to a multi-faceted understanding of co-creating drama. Three main themes emerged. The teachers discuss the practical implications of navigating the co-creating experience, the importance of teacher commitment, and the outcomes of co-creating drama. N...|$|E
40|$|Tezin basılısı İstanbul Şehir Üniversitesi Kütüphanesi'ndedir. The {{variety of}} {{theoretical}} approaches {{that have emerged}} as results of extensive empirical research within the new sociology of knowledge during {{the last fifty years}} may offer useful perspectives for explaining the dizzying historical processes of the late Ottoman period in a way to cope with the substantialist, teleological, and dichotomist perspectives that have long dominated late Ottoman historiography. Located within the new sociology of knowledge, this thesis seeks to provide a historical sociological explanation of the disciplinary transformation of Ottoman legal education from 1826 to 1926, primarily based on the available historical scholarship. Utilizing Abbott’s theory of linked ecologies/interactional fields and a Bourdieusian analysis of modern state formation, this thesis offers first a structural analysis of the formations of the Ottoman higher educational ecology to the nineteenth century as the historical background of later transformations. It then analyses the historical conditions of possibility for the disciplinary transformation of the Ottoman legal education from 1826 to 1926. The thesis has two main arguments. The first is that the disciplinary transformation of Ottoman legal education took place as a result of several processes of competition, which constituted aspects of the overarching process of modern state formation, between diverse bureaucratic, higher educational, judicial, and disciplinary collective actors within an interactional field at the intersection of bureaucratic, higher educational, and judicial ecologies. The second argument is that the increasing amount of symbolic power emergent collective actors (such as the Maarif Nezareti or Mekteb-i Hukuk) accumulated to the detriment of rooted collective actors (such as the Meşihat or madrasa system) within the aforementioned interactional field during the processes of modern state formation allowed the discipline of law to gradually dominate curricular space of legal education at the expense of fiqh, thus transforming Ottoman legal education from a fiqh-centered to a law-centered disciplinary structure.

This thesis {{examines}} al-ʻIqd al-Manzum fi Dhikr Afazil al-Rum, {{one of the}} continuations of Ahmed Taşköprizade’s (d. 1561) renowned biographical dictionary al-Shaqaʾiq al-Nuʿmaniyya fi ʿUlama al-Dawla al-ʿUthmaniyya, {{in order}} to understand the mind of its author Ali b. Bali (d. 1584). This study presents an authorial context for al-ʻIqd al-Manzum by constructing Ali b. Bali’s biography. Then, it provides a textual context by examining al-ʻIqd al-Manzum as a biographical dictionary in relation with the general trend of biography writing in the sixteenth-century Ottoman world. Ali was well aware that he had two groups of readers, first, the Ottoman scholars in the core lands of the empire (in the lands of Rum), and second, the scholars outside of the core lands, who were speaking Arabic as their mother tongue. Ali tried to show his command of Arabic before his peers as well as to prove the scholarly competence of Rumi scholars before other groups of scholars within the empire. Last two chapters focus on two themes, respectively Ali’s perception of decline in the Ottoman scholarly life and his ideas about Sufism. Ali’s bitter experience in scholarly career path had an influence on his perspective of his age and contemporaries. Taking refuge in Sufism, Ali emphasized the conformity of Sufism with sharia and created a powerful image of his own sheikh Cerrahzade as one of the prominent sheikhs of the Bayrami order.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a number of}} recently developed cluster-flipping algorithms for the efficient simulation of classical spin models near their critical temperature. These include the algorithms of Wolff, Swendsen and Wang, and Niedermeyer, {{as well as the}} limited cluster algorithm, the multigrid methods of Kandel and co-workers, and the invaded cluster algorithm. We describe the application of these algorithms to Ising, Potts, and continuous spin models. Monte Carlo simulations of classical spin systems such as the Ising model can usually be performed simply and very efficiently using local update algorithms such as the Metropolis or heat-bath algorithms. However, in the vicinity of a continuous phase transition, these algorithms display dramatic critical slowing down, making them extremely poor tools for the study of critical phenomena. In the last ten years or so, a number of new Monte Carlo algorithms making use of non-local update moves have been developed to address this problem. In this chapter we examine a number of these algorithms in some detail, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. The <b>outline</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chapter</b> is as follows. I...|$|R

One of these strategies, creating entire alternative courses, will then be dealt with in more detail, as this was the main strategy that I pursued with some of my colleagues. There are three possible ways in which entire new courses can be created, and these three sub-strategies will be considered in turn, since all three were pursued. Finally, my more recent experience in adapting a first-year textbook will be discussed in the last section, before the conclusion. I have no particular expertise in pedagogy, and so my comments will be limited to elements of autobiography, some history of recent economic thought, the description of some of the courses that I have taught over the years, and a little analytical content...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of the main topics concerning the restandardization process of Italian. We will first discuss some general issues related to the Italian sociolinguistic situation, paying special attention to the status of Italo-Romance dialects and their relationship with Italian, the demotization process entailed by the twentieth century massive spread of the standard language, and the connection between neo-standard Italian and regional standards. The focus will then turn to neo-standard Italian: in particular, we will deal with some morphosyntactic features which were excluded from the standard literary norm (codified and established in the sixteenth century) but have survived over time in non-standard varieties. These features finally penetrated the standard usage, progressively giving rise to what is called neo-standard Italian. After a concise review of previous studies on neo-standard Italian, we will situate this variety within the current debate on the development of “new standards” in various European languages. In this respect, special consideration will be given to the notions of “destandardization”, “informalization” and “dehomogenization”.
