5|$|Wine was {{commonly}} {{drunk and}} was also regarded as the most prestigious and healthy choice. According to Galen's dietetics it was considered hot and dry but these qualities were moderated when wine was watered down. Unlike water or beer, which were considered cold and moist, consumption of wine in moderation (especially red wine) was, among other things, believed to aid digestion, generate good blood and brighten the mood. The quality of wine differed considerably according to vintage, the type of grape and more importantly, the number of grape pressings. The first pressing was made into the finest and most expensive wines which were reserved for the upper classes. The second and third pressings were subsequently of lower quality and alcohol content. Common folk usually {{had to settle for}} a cheap white or rosé from a second or even third pressing, meaning that it could be consumed in quite generous amounts without leading to heavy intoxication. For the poorest (<b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> pious), watered-down vinegar (similar to Ancient Roman posca) would often be the only available choice.|$|E

His intention was to build an industrial community to house his workers adjacent to the Colt Armory. By 1856, it was a city within a city, where workers of many nationalities and religions worked and lived alongside one another. Coltsville was among the first of America's 19th century company towns, and it was easily the most advanced of its time—though not the largest, the most prominent, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> tightly controlled.

25|$|A Brahman {{who becomes}} a priest (pedanda) is {{entitled}} to a larger residence, called griya. Similarly, royal families are entitled a puri ("palace"). Both griya and puri consist of multiple courtyards instead of single courtyard. These multiple courtyards, similarly surrounded by pavilions, create its own subdivision within the extensive house compound. Each subdivision follows the same importance, and so the subdivision located in the kaja-kangin direction is always the most auspicious where {{the most important of}} the family shrines are usually located. In a royal palace, each courtyard compound corresponds to a specific use relating to royal duties. Despite the complexity of a griya or a puri, spatial orientation and hierarchical organization principle remains the same: the kaja-kangin is always the most auspicious corner. Principally, the consistent spatial orientation and hierarchy of Balinese traditional houses, whether it is the most lavish <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> humblest, are harmoniously linked with each other.|$|E
25|$|There are forty nine {{important}} mostly secular festivals {{through the}} year, {{with the most}} important being the Feria de la Nieve, Feria de la Alegría y el Olivo, and the Flor más Bellas del Ejido. The “Flor más Bella del Ejido” (Most Beautiful Flower of the Ejido or Field) pageant is a borough-wide event dedicated to fjthe beauty of Mexican indigenous women. The origins of this event are traced back over 220 years with symbolism {{that is based on}} the pre-Hispanic notion of a “flower-woman” representative of Mother Earth and fertility. This flower-woman is based on the goddess Xochiquetzal, the goddess of flowers and love, robbed from her husband Tlaloc by Tezcatlipoca. After the Conquest, this “flower-woman” symbol survived and would appear at certain Catholic festivals such as the Viernes de Dolores, or the Friday before Palm Sunday. An official pageant dedicated to this was established in 1786. Originally, its purpose was religious but it eventually became secularized. For this reason, the event was moved to a week before the Viernes de Dolores and then called the Viernes de las Amapolas. The event existed in this form for 170 years, with dancing, food, pulque, charros and pageants featuring china poblanas. In 1902, the tradition diminished as the last of the canals connecting the area with the Jamaica market closed. In 1921, the El Universal newspaper held a beauty pageant for the 100th anniversary {{of the end of the}} Mexican War of Independence, calling it “La India Bonita” dedicated to indigenous women. The first winner was María Bibiana Uribe. In 1936, another pageant was created for mestizo women called “la Flor Más Bella del Ejido” <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>Most</b> Beautiful Flower of the Ejido, which occurred each year on the Viernes de Dolores in the Santa Anita area. This event was moved to San Andres Mixquic in the 1950s, but the lack of crowds had it move again in 1955 to Xochimilco, where it remains.|$|E
25|$|Doug Wright {{was seen}} as England's trump card {{when he arrived in}} Australia, but he was either the unluckiest <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> over-rated spinner to tour Australia. Don Bradman said he was the best leg-spinner to tour Australia since Sydney Barnes 35 years before, and Keith Miller thought he was the best leg-spinner he knew after Bill O'Reilly. After Tich Freeman retired Wright became Kent's main spinner, taking 2,056 wickets (23.98) and a record seven first class hat-tricks. His long rollicking run up and brisk pace gave away many no-balls and too often he served up full tosses and long hops, but he turned the ball {{fiercely}} and his googly had even the best batsmen groping. His ability to run through a side made him the terror of the County circuit, but he rarely achieved this in Tests. In the Fifth Test at Sydney his 7/105 dismissed Australia for 253 and in 1947 his 10/175 in the Second Test gave England a 10 wicket victory over South Africa. His great asset was that he always looked as if he was about to take a wicket, but in Australia in 1946–47 and again in 1950–51 he proved too expensive and like Bedser was overbowled. Their second leg-spinner was Peter Smith, who was preferred to Eric Hollies because of his batting, but he injured a finger on the journey to Australia and had an appendix removed once there. Even so, he was effective in tour matches - his 9/121 against NSW is the best bowling return by an Englishman in Australia - but was understandably below par in his only Test. James Langridge was a veteran Slow Left Arm bowler who started his trade in 1924, and had taken 92 wickets (22.11) in 1946, but he was 41 years old on his first tour of Australia and just when he appeared to be finding his form he strained a muscle and could not play. Jack Ikin was a part-time leg-spinner whose bowling was thought to be of all round status early in his career (helped by the very poor wickets at Old Trafford), but Hammond used him rarely and he proved to be expensive in the Tests.|$|E

500|$|When the M3 {{anti-tank}} gun {{proved to be}} a less than optimum anti-tank weapon, the Army began development of tank destroyers – self-propelled tracked vehicles with a gun capable of engaging a tank, but which were faster and more maneuverable because they had thinner armor than a tank. [...] When it appeared that the Infantry and Cavalry branch chiefs might subsume proposed tank destroyer units into their own task organizations, Marshall attempted to continue progress on tank destroyer development without generating active dissent by approving creation of the Tank Destroyer Center at Camp Hood.

In this system, every mou of farmland was divided into 3,840 grids which each had a small pit that was dug [...] deep and [...] wide and had good quality manure mixed into the soil. Twenty seeds were sowed into each pit, which allegedly produced 0.6 L (20 oz) of harvested grain per pit, or roughly 2,000 L (67,630 oz) per mou. This system did not require oxen-driven plows <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> fertile land, since it could be employed even on sloping terrains where supplying water was difficult for other methods of farming. Although this farming method was favored by the poor, it did require intensive labor, thus only large families could maintain such a system.|$|E

500|$|The Payne Study and Experiment Fund {{was created}} in 1927 by Frances Payne Bolton to support {{a study of the}} {{influence}} of fiction on children. The Payne Fund Studies, a series of eight books published from 1933 to 1935 which detailed five (5) years of research aimed specifically at the cinema's effects on children, were also gaining publicity at this time, and became a great concern to Hays. Hays had said certain pictures might alter [...] "... that sacred thing, the mind of a child … that clean, virgin thing, that unmarked state" [...] and have [...] "the same responsibility, the same care about the thing put on it that the best clergyman <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> inspired teacher would have." [...] Despite its initial reception, the main findings of the study were largely innocuous. It found that cinema's effect on individuals varied with age and social position, and that pictures reinforced audiences' existing beliefs. The Motion Picture Research Council (MPRC, led by honorary vice president Sara Delano Roosevelt (mother of President Franklin D. Roosevelt), and executive director the Rev. William H. Short) which funded the study, was not pleased. An [...] "alarmist summary" [...] of the study's results written by Henry James Forman appeared in McCall's, a leading women's magazine of the time, and Forman's book, Our Movie Made Children, which became a best-seller, publicized the Payne Fund's results, emphasizing its more negative aspects.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to the song, {{much like}} the album, was highly positive. Jeff Vice of Deseret News noted [...] " [...] dynamic first single that pays homage to Bob Marley, may start a new musical trend with its brilliant Rasta-funk." [...] Patrick MacDonald of The Seattle Times commented that [...] " [...] includes {{one of the best}} songs the Peppers have done—'Give It Away', the first single. The hook is irresistible and the message, about 'material excess,' is delivered simply and straightforwardly." [...] Steve Huey of Allmusic felt the song was enhanced by Kiedis' lyrics, which were [...] "a free-associative mixture of positive vibes, tributes to musical heroes, and free love, and their literal meaning was often as difficult to understand as Kiedis' nasal, staccato enunciation. But that distinctive vocal style helped make the most comprehensible lines even catchier and more memorable, greatly enhancing the song's appeal." [...] He continued by praising the track's music, [...] "John Frusciante's guitar should not be underappreciated either; his noisy, scratchy funk-rock work add depth and texture to the powerhouse rhythm section of Flea and Chad Smith." [...] Jay Clarke of the Richmond Times-Dispatch felt [...] "Give It Away" [...] was [...] "a journey into the funky world of Kiedis and Flea. This song invigorates better than the heaviest metal <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> hard-core rap."
