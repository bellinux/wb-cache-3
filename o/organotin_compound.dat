40|$|Abstract—Ascidians (Phylum Chordata) are sessile, filter feeding marine animals. We have {{developed}} a large-scale oligo DNA microarray of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, and have obtained the expression patterns for 10, 415 genes of C. intestinalis expressed during its life cycle. These were categorized into 49 clusters, which were then grouped into 5 super-clusters. Using these DNA arrays, we identified genes that were up- or down-regulated in ascidians following exposure to <b>organotin</b> <b>compounds,</b> which are recognized marine contaminants. <b>Organotin</b> <b>compounds</b> induced up- or down-regulation of many ascidian genes, most of which belonged to a specific gene cluster or super-cluster, such as the “juvenile-specific gene cluster ” or “embryonic and adult gene super-cluster “ in our classification system. This result suggested that <b>organotin</b> <b>compounds</b> might affect embryogenesis and metamorphosis in ascidians.

40|$|<b>Organotin</b> <b>compounds</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} in numerous industrial applications {{and in particular}} are commonly used as thermal stabilizers for ployvinylchloride plastic (PVC) as catalysts for production of rigid polyurethane foam and as biocides. Recently, {{questions have been raised}} regarding the potential adverse environmental impact of <b>organotin</b> <b>compounds,</b> particularly the tributyltin oxide (TBTO) and the tributyltin chloride (TBTC), as residues leached from ships and boats treated with antifouling paints containing these two compounds. It has been observed that <b>organotin</b> <b>compounds</b> tend to acumulate in marine organisms causing definite toxic effects.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{literature}} {{related to the}} bioavailability of tin, inorganic tin <b>compounds,</b> and <b>organotin</b> <b>compounds.</b> On the one hand, the toxicity of metallic tin and inorganic tin compounds is low. In aqueous systems, the potential bioavailability of tin seems {{to depend on the}} concentration of the truly dissolved ion species.

Triorganotin compounds are particularly toxic explaining their wide use as biocides (e. g., in antifouling paints or pesticides). Persistence of <b>organotin</b> <b>compounds</b> is governed by moderate to fast aerobic biotic degradation processes, slow anaerobic biotic degradation, slow abiotic degradation by photolysis, and fast, but reversible, adsorption/desorption processes. <b>Organotin</b> <b>compounds</b> are ubiquitously distributed in aquatic organisms.
