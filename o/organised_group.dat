5|$|To be {{more useful}} to the struggle, Jasper and Bert travel to Ireland and the Soviet Union to offer their {{services}} to the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the KGB, but are turned down. A more <b>organised</b> <b>group</b> of revolutionaries moves in next door and start using Alice's house as a conduit for arms, to which Alice objects. Mysterious strangers visit the squat and question their decision making.|$|E
5|$|A random {{assemblage}} of fish merely using some localised resource {{such as food}} or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending {{on the degree of}} organisation. A shoal is a loosely <b>organised</b> <b>group</b> where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to {{the other members of the}} group. Schools of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.|$|E
50|$|Fringe festivals {{typically}} {{have a common}} <b>organising</b> <b>group</b> that handles ticketing, scheduling and some overall promotion (such as a program including all performers). Each production pays a set fee to this group, which usually includes their stage {{time as well as}} the organizational elements. The <b>organising</b> <b>group</b> and/or the venues often rely on a large pool of volunteers.|$|R
50|$|Internals {{disagreements}} {{within the}} <b>organising</b> <b>group</b> and pull-outs from high-profile sponsors affected the race between 2009 and 2011. A new <b>organising</b> <b>group</b> was {{established for the}} 2012 race and Hamburger Sparkasse ("Haspa", a regional bank) became the title sponsor. This coincided with a resurgence in the elite level race, as both men's and women's course records were broken.|$|R

25|$|As of 24 December 2010, six of {{the nine}} accused have pleaded guilty. One of them, Andrei Lunev, a Russian citizen, is {{believed}} to have made a plea bargain with the Russian prosecution service. He was tried with no contest and was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment on 7 May 2010. According to the Criminal Code of Russia such an offence is punishable by 5 to 10 years imprisonment, but the maximum term is increased to 15 years if an act of piracy is performed by an <b>organised</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{official}} end-of-life, the Myth series {{continued to have}} an active online fanbase, particularly Soulblighter. The first <b>organised</b> <b>group</b> of programmers, artists and coders from the game's community were known as MythDevelopers, who asked for, and were granted access to the source code so as to continue its development. With the blessing of Take-Two, Bungie released their entire archive of Myth-related materials to MythDevelopers, including the source code, artwork, all creative files (such as maps, 3D models, scripts, etc.), and documentation; over 80GB of material. MythDevelopers were also granted access to the source code for The Wolf Age. Bungie also open sourced their Myth metaserver source code in 2002.|$|E
25|$|The MDC's first {{opportunity}} to test opposition to the Mugabe government came in February 2000, when a referendum was held on a draft constitution proposed by the government. Among its elements, the new constitution would have permitted President Mugabe to seek two additional terms in office, granted government officials immunity from prosecution, and authorised government seizure of white-owned land. The referendum was handily defeated. Shortly thereafter, the government, through a loosely <b>organised</b> <b>group</b> of war veterans,some of the so-called war veterans judging from their age were not war veterans as they {{were too young to}} have fought in the chimurenga, sanctioned an aggressive land redistribution program often characterised by forced expulsion of white farmers and violence against both farmers and farm employees.|$|E

25|$|By this time, de Vere {{had made}} many enemies amongst the nobles who resented the high favour in which de Vere {{was held by}} the King. In point of fact, it was his close {{relationship}} to King Richard which was the catalyst {{for the formation of}} the Lords Appellant which was an <b>organised</b> <b>group</b> of noblemen who seized political control of the kingdom from King Richard. In the same year of his marriage to Agnes, de Vere led royal forces against the Lords Appellant but the former were defeated at Radcot Bridge on 20 December 1387, and de Vere, after escaping by leaping into the river on horseback and galloping away on the other side, made his way to London. He was forced into exile by Parliament in 1388 and went to live in Louvain, Brabant. Robert de Vere was subsequently declared a traitor, and his honours and properties were forfeited.|$|E
25|$|Individual Huguenots {{settled at}} the Cape of Good Hope from {{as early as}} 1671 {{with the arrival of}} François Villion (Viljoen). The first Huguenot to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope was however Maria de la Quellerie, wife of {{commander}} Jan van Riebeeck (and daughter of a Walloon church minister), who arrived on 6 April 1652 to establish a settlement at what is today Cape Town. The couple left for the Batavia ten years later. On 31 December 1687 the first <b>organised</b> <b>group</b> of Huguenots set sail from the Netherlands to the Dutch East India Company post at the Cape of Good Hope. The largest portion of the Huguenots to settle in the Cape arrived between 1688 and 1689 in seven ships as part of the organised migration, but quite a few arrived as late as 1700; thereafter, the numbers declined and only small groups arrived at a time.|$|E
500|$|Hare {{coursing}} {{was banned}} by the Hunting Act 2004. However, as of 2015 it continues, illegally. Allegedly, typical <b>organised</b> <b>group</b> coursing involves two to 12 people walking in a line approximately 10 metres apart and then slipping their dogs to chase flushed hares. [...] The dogs may be filmed so that the coursing can be played later, if & when betting occurs. [...] It is suggested that hare coursing occurs {{on a large scale}} in Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk, although the [...] "gangs" [...] may travel large distances to course hares.|$|E

500|$|John Alan Coey (12 November 1950 – 19 July 1975) was an American {{soldier who}} served in the Rhodesian Army as one of [...] "the Crippled Eagles", a loosely <b>organised</b> <b>group</b> of US expatriates {{fighting}} for the unrecognised government of Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe) during that country's Bush War. A devout Christian and fervent anti-communist—the African-American historian [...] Gerald Horne described him as a white supremacist of the political ultra-right—he was the first American fatality of the war. He moved to Rhodesia to join its army in 1972, the day after graduating from college in his home town of Columbus, Ohio, and served until he was killed in action in 1975. He kept a journal throughout his service that was posthumously published as A Martyr Speaks.|$|E
500|$|Three of the Blacks' {{leaders had}} already been {{captured}} during {{the passage of the}} Act, although one later escaped, and a series of raids captured a total of 32 Blacks who were tried after the Act's passage in Reading. Four were sentenced to death for the killing of the gamekeeper's son, with the executions occurring on 15 June 1723. Trials for the others continued into 1724, and 7 more were captured and tried on 7 December. This marked the effective end of the Blacks as an <b>organised</b> <b>group.</b> At the time, it was thought that the Blacks were Jacobites, with Sir Robert Walpole encouraging these ideas to advance his own interests; the rationale for the Act has been described as [...] "at least {{as much to do with}} the hysteria induced by Walpole...as with any need for new powers to fight deer-stealing".|$|E
500|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939 {{saw some of the}} Fraternity's members enlist in the armed forces, putting a stop to many of the group's activities. From October 1939 through to October 1942, Fortune <b>organised</b> <b>group</b> meditations every Sunday with the intent of focusing Fraternity members towards the cause of peace. In February 1940, she undertook a visualisation in which she imagined angelic forces patrolling Britain's coast, believing that in doing so she was helping to make these forces a reality. She urged Fraternity members to repeat a mantra every time the German Luftwaffe began bombing Britain, through which she hoped to call upon [...] "Invisible Helpers" [...] from the [...] "Inner Planes" [...] to aid the people affected. The Fraternity's London headquarters were damaged during the Blitz, although roofing repairs were made and the group were able to move back into the building after a week. In August 1940, the group had to suspend publication of Inner Light as a result of paper shortages in Britain.|$|E
30|$|And thirdly, echoing a point also {{stressed}} in Tobin’s list, in consulting, {{economists are}} responsible {{that all the}} economic effects of possible measures {{are taken into account}} and not only the most evident ones. Political analyses very often focus on especially influential and well <b>organised</b> <b>groups.</b> However, it is imperative that the impacts on poorly organised (e.g. consumers) or not <b>organised</b> <b>groups</b> (e.g. next generation) are made transparent by economic analyses. Ideally, economists represent {{the economy as a whole}} within politics.|$|R
5000|$|Kris Hopkins, Conservative MP for Keighley, {{condemned}} what {{he called}} the [...] "sick model of <b>organised</b> <b>groups</b> of Asian men grooming young white girls" [...] and claimed that more women were still suffering abuse in the same way. In a statement issued by his office, he said the convictions were vindication of controversial comments he had made in parliament in 2012, when he said that <b>organised</b> <b>groups</b> of Asian men were raping white girls. He claimed to have been criticized for these claims.|$|R
