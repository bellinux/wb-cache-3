25|$|Geographical {{distribution}} of human variation {{is complex and}} constantly shifts through time which reflects complicated human evolutionary history. Most human biological variation is clinally distributed and blends gradually from one area to the next. Groups <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world have different frequencies of polymorphic genes. Furthermore, different traits are non-concordant and each have different clinal distribution. Adaptability varies both {{from person to person}} and from population to population. The most efficient adaptive responses are found in geographical populations where the environmental stimuli are the strongest (e.g. Tibetans are highly adapted to high altitudes). The clinal geographic genetic variation is further complicated by the migration and mixing between human populations which has been occurring since prehistoric times.|$|E
25|$|Advances in {{technology}} in the 1980s made the computer more affordable and more capable {{than they were in}} previous decades, which facilitated the rise of computer such as the Xbox gaming.

In the 1990s, computer games became widely popular with the release of such game as The Sims and Command & Conquer and the still increasing power of desktop computers. Today, computer simulation games such as World of Warcraft are played by millions <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E

25|$|The union between Moldavia and Wallachia in 1859 {{brought a}} growing {{consolidation}} of Romanian life and culture. Universities were opened in Iaşi and in Bucharest {{and the number}} of new cultural establishments grew significantly. The new prince from 1866 and then King of Romania, Carol I was a devoted king, and he and his wife Elisabeth were among the main patrons of arts. Of great impact in Romanian literature was the literary circle Junimea, founded by a group <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> literary critic Titu Maiorescu in 1863. It published its cultural journal Convorbiri Literare where, among others, Mihai Eminescu, Romania's greatest poet, Ion Creangă, a storyteller of genius, and Ion Luca Caragiale, novelist and the Romania's greatest playwright published most of their works. During the same period, Nicolae Grigorescu and Ştefan Luchian founded modern Romanian painting; composer Ciprian Porumbescu was also from this time.|$|E
25|$|Yerevan, {{the capital}} of Armenia, {{experienced}} substantial growth during the postwar period when it was {{the capital of}} the Armenian SSR. Due to the city's very uneven landscape only an underground system could meet all of the criteria to efficiently move large numbers <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> city. The first plans for a rapid transit system began to be formed in the late 1960s, under the auspice of Anton Kochinyan, then the 1st secretary of the Communist Party of Armenia. Initially this was centred on a rapid tram system, rather than a full underground metro system. During this time, the Soviet City Engineering Planning Department clearly stated that a Metro system would only be awarded to cities with more than a population of one million, which Yerevan lacked at the start of construction (1972). Nevertheless, all of the tunnels in which the tram lines were to be installed were built to a design that would have allowed a potential conversion into a full underground metro system.|$|E
