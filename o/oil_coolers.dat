The E-1 had its original powerplant, the DB 600 replaced with the Jumo 210 Ga engines. The more powerful Jumo 211 A-1 engines desired by the Ministry of Aviation were not yet ready for installation. Another trial aircraft, He 111 V10 (D-ALEQ) was to be fitted with two <b>oil</b> <b>coolers</b> necessary for the Jumo 211 A-1 installation.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September 1996, NSB's {{administration}} {{recommended that}} the purchase be terminated. However, this was put on hold by the board. Instead, a renegotiated contract was signed, whereby Siemens was obliged to deliver the locomotives, as specified, by mid-1997. If not, the two parties agreed that the contract would be terminated. By late 1996, five locomotives had been delivered, and these were returned to Kiel for upgrades. The first returned to Norway on 30 November 1996, after the ventilator motors had been upgraded, new <b>oil</b> <b>coolers</b> installed and other minor upgrades had been performed. From January 1997, they were put into regular use with freight trains on the Nordland Line. In mid-1997, number 664 was damaged in a fire caused by an incorrectly mounted exhaust system.

50|$|The 801 used a {{relatively}} complex system, {{integral to the}} BMW-designed, matching forward cowling system, to cool the lubricating oil. A ring-shaped oil cooler core was built into the BMW-provided forward cowl, just behind the fan. The outer portion of the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler's</b> core was {{in contact with the}} main cowling's sheetmetal, to possibly act as a heat sink. Comprising the BMW-designed forward cowl, in front of the oil cooler was a ring of metal with a C-shaped cross-section, with the outer lip lying just outside the rim of the cowl, and the inner side {{on the inside of the}} oil cooler core. Together, the metal ring and cowling formed an S-shaped airflow path, with the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler's</b> core contained between them. Airflow past the gap between the cowl and outer lip of the metal ring produced a vacuum effect that pulled air from the front of the engine outward and forward within the cowl's frontmost inner area just behind the fan, flowing forward across the oil cooler core in a separate airflow path from the rearwards-direction flow that cooled the engine's cylinders, just to provide cooling for the 801's oil. The rate of cooling airflow over the core could be controlled by moving the metal ring slightly forward or aft in order to open or close the gap.|$|R
50|$|The {{reasons for}} this complex system were threefold. One was to {{eliminate}} any extra aerodynamic drag that a protruding oil cooler would produce, in this case eliminating the extra drag factor by enclosing it within the engine's forward cowling. The second was to warm the air before it flowed to the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler's</b> circular-shaped core to aid warming the oil during starting. Finally, by placing the oil cooler behind the fan, cooling was provided even while the aircraft was parked. The downside to this design was that the oil cooler was in an extremely vulnerable location, and the metal ring was increasingly armoured as the war progressed.|$|R
2500|$|The {{eventual}} {{choice of}} the BMW 801 14-cylinder radial over the more troublesome BMW 139 also brought with it a BMW-designed cowling [...] "system" [...] which integrated the radiator used to cool the motor oil. An annular, ring-shaped oil cooler core was built into the BMW-provided forward cowl, just behind the fan. The outer portion of the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler's</b> core was {{in contact with the}} main cowling's sheet metal. Comprising the BMW-designed forward cowl, in front of the oil cooler was a ring of metal with a C-shaped cross-section, with the outer lip lying just outside the rim of the cowl, and the inner side {{on the inside of the}} oil cooler core. Together, the metal ring and cowling formed an S-shaped duct with the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler's</b> core contained between them. Airflow past the gap between the cowl and outer lip of the metal ring produced a vacuum effect that pulled air from the front of the engine forward across the oil cooler core to provide cooling for the 801's motor oil. The rate of cooling airflow over the core could be controlled by moving the metal ring in order to open or close the gap. The reasons for this complex system were threefold. One was to reduce any extra aerodynamic drag of the oil radiator, in this case largely eliminating it by placing it within the same cowling as the engine. The second was to warm the air before it flowed to the radiator to aid warming the oil during starting. Finally, by placing the radiator behind the fan, cooling was provided even while the aircraft was parked. The disadvantage to this design was that the radiator was in an extremely vulnerable location, and the metal ring was increasingly armoured as the war progressed.|$|R

25|$|Essentially {{similar to}} the P-47B, the initial P-47C {{featured}} strengthened all-metal control surfaces, an upgraded GE turbosupercharger regulator, and a short vertical radio mast. After the initial manufacture of a block of 57 P-47Cs, production moved to the P-47C-1, which had an 8in (20cm) fuselage extension forward of the cockpit at the firewall to correct center of gravity problems, ease engine maintenance and allow installation of a new engine mount. There {{were a number of}} other changes, such as revised exhausts for the <b>oil</b> <b>coolers,</b> and fixes to brakes, undercarriage and electrical systems, as well as a redesigned rudder and elevator balance. The 55 P-47C-1s were followed by 128 P-47C-2s which introduced a centerline hardpoint with under-fuselage shackles for either a 500lb (227kg) bomb or a 200U.S. gal (758l, 167Imp gal) fuel tank that conformed to the underside of the fuselage. The main production P-47C sub-variant was the P-47C-5 which introduced a new whip antenna. With the use of pressurized drop tanks, the P-47C was able to extend its range on missions beginning 30 July 1943.|$|E

25|$|The Corsair's {{aerodynamics}} were {{an advance}} over those of contemporary naval fighters. The F4U {{was the first}} U.S. Navy aircraft to feature landing gear that retracted into a fully enclosed wheel well. The landing gear oleo struts — each with their own strut door enclosing them when retracted — rotated through 90° during retraction, with the wheel atop {{the lower end of}} the strut when retracted; a pair of rectangular doors enclosed each wheel well, leaving a streamlined wing. This swiveling, aft-retracting landing gear design was common to the Curtiss P-40 (and its predecessor, the Curtiss P-36), as adopted for the F4U Corsair's main gear and its erstwhile Pacific War counterpart, the Grumman F6F Hellcat. The <b>oil</b> <b>coolers</b> were mounted in the heavily anhedraled center-section of the wings, alongside the supercharger air intakes, and used openings in the leading edges of the wings, rather than protruding scoops. The large fuselage panels were made of aluminum and were attached to the frames with the newly developed technique of spot welding, thus mostly eliminating the use of rivets. While employing this new technology, the Corsair was also the last American-produced fighter aircraft to feature fabric as the skinning for the top and bottom of each outer wing, aft of the main spar and armament bays, and for the ailerons, elevators and rudder. The elevators were also constructed from plywood. The Corsair, even with its streamlining and high speed abilities, could fly slowly enough for carrier landings with full flap deployment of 60°.|$|E
500|$|The wing {{leading edges}} were swept {{back to a}} point inline with the engine nacelles, while the {{trailing}} edges were angled forward slightly. The wing contained two 700L (190US gal) fuel tanks between the inner wing main spars, while {{at the head of}} the main spar the <b>oil</b> <b>coolers</b> were fitted. Between the outer spars, a second pair of reserve fuel tanks were located, carrying an individual capacity of 910L (240US gal) of fuel. The outer trailing edges were formed by the ailerons and flaps, which were met by smooth wing tips which curved forward into the leading edge. The outer leading edge sections were installed in the shape of a curved [...] "strip nosed" [...] rib, which was positioned ahead of the main spar. Most of the interior ribs were not solid, with the exception of the ribs located between the rear main spar and the flaps and ailerons. These were of solid construction, though even they had lightening holes.|$|E
500|$|A low-wing, twin-engined, twin-tailed monoplane, the DIS was {{of mixed}} construction. The front section was built from duralumin, the middle section was a wooden {{monocoque}} and the rear section was steel tubes {{covered with a}} duralumin skin. The twin tails were wooden and had an electrically operated variable-incidence horizontal stabilizer. The elevators had duralumin frames, but were covered by fabric. The two-spar wing was made in three pieces. The center section was metal, but the outer panels were wooden with fabric-covered ailerons and veneer-covered Schrenk flaps. The wing had leading edge slats along two-thirds of its length. The main undercarriage retracted rearwards into {{the rear of the}} engine nacelles and the tailwheel retracted into the rear fuselage. The Mikulin AM-37 inline engines were slung underneath the wings with the engine <b>oil</b> <b>coolers</b> mounted in the outer wing panels. The air intakes for the engine superchargers were located in the wing leading edge. The pilot was provided with a glass panel {{on the underside of the}} nose to improve his downward visibility, and he was protected by armor up to [...] thick at the front, rear, sides and underside of his seat. The fuel capacity was [...] in two protected tanks behind the pilot, and another four in the wings.|$|E
5000|$|The TRD Sport package {{comes in}} two levels. The first level has a color-matched grille, color-matched front/rear bumpers, color-matched door handles, color-matched mirrors, Bilstein shocks/struts, TRD interior, hood with scoop, A/C {{inverter}} in the bed, bed rails with cleats, stainless steel exhaust tip and 17" [...] wheels. The second level includes the above and also adds a towing package (<b>oil</b> and transmission <b>coolers),</b> and heavy-duty high output alternator. [...] The 2005 to 2008 model years {{came with a}} mechanical true limited slip locking differential. The 2009 model year onwards has an open differential with a brake assisted [...] "automatic limited slip" [...] rear differential, similar to a VSC system.|$|R
2500|$|When ordered {{with the}} factory towing package, the 1994-1996 Roadmaster was rated to tow up to 5000 pounds. [...] For the station wagon, {{this could be}} raised to 7000 pounds {{with the use of}} a weight-distributing hitch, dual sway controls, setting rear tire {{pressure}} to 35 PSI, and disabling the Electronic Level Control. [...] The towing package added 2.93 rear-axle gears and a limited slip differential, heavy duty cooling system including <b>oil</b> and transmission <b>coolers,</b> and a factory installed self leveling rear suspension consisting of air shocks, a height sensor between the rear axle and body and an on-board air compressor. Most visibly, a pair of electric fans offset to the left under the hood was replaced by [...] the combination of one conventional fan driven mechanically from the engine alongside one electric fan.|$|R

Cammi, L. Luzzi, A. A. Porta, M. E. Ricotti, Prog. Nucl. Energ. 48 (2006) 578], in order to describe the interactions among the different subsystems: i. e., the accelerator-core coupling, the lead bismuth eutectic (LBE) primary system, the secondary system with diathermic <b>oil</b> and air <b>coolers</b> batteries, which reject the thermal power to the environment. Hereinafter, a model {{predictive control}}ler is proposed, with the objective to minimize the difference between the average temperature of the diathermic oil and its reference value, while also minimizing the variations of the control input, which is the air coolers mass flow rate. The dynamic response of the LBE–XADS has been evaluated with reference to a reduction of 20 % in the reactor power from nominal load conditions: this transient is very demanding for the overall plant, nevertheless the obtained results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed controller...|$|R

40|$|Majority of air {{compressor}} plants installed worldwide operate permanently under unsteady conditions, however, {{there is still}} a lack of published papers which describe the plant dynamics and offer quantification parameters of the phenomenon. An experimental and analytical study of a screw compressor operation under unsteady conditions has been carried out. For this purpose a one dimensional model of the processes within a screw compressor based on the differential equations of conservation of mass and energy was extended to include other plant components, taking into account tanks and connecting piping. The analytical model was then further developed to demonstrate the whole plant transient operation when a screw compressor is connected with other plant elements in a complete complex {{air compressor}} plant which consists of the positive displacement compressor, then the low pressure and high pressure tanks and communications between them and auxiliary equipment, like control valves, storage tanks and heat exchangers, like <b>oil</b> and air <b>coolers.</b> Results of such a model are verified with the experimental data and presented in diagrams which confirm good agreement between experiment and simulation.

2500|$|The Bristol 138, the record-breaking {{machine is}} a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane designed to fly at extremely high altitudes for the era. Aviation publication Flight observed {{of the aircraft}} that: [...] "except for its size, reminds one very much of the little Bristol Brownie.... the machine is the largest single-seater aeroplane ever built". The pilot was seated in a relatively spacious cockpit, which was heated by air directed from the <b>oil</b> <b>coolers</b> set within the wings, which could be actively controlled. Instrumentation included fore-and-aft levels, oil pressure gauges, airspeed indicator and fuel gauge, engine speed indicator and pyrometer. Purpose-built recording altimeters, developed by the RAE, were housed within the wings, while a separate altimeter was installed within the cockpit for the pilot.|$|E
2500|$|AU-1:U.S. Marines attack variant {{with extra}} armor {{to protect the}} pilot and fuel tank, and the <b>oil</b> <b>coolers</b> {{relocated}} inboard to reduce vulnerability to ground fire. The supercharger was simplified as the design was intended for low-altitude operation. [...] Extra racks were also fitted. [...] Fully loaded for combat the AU-1 weighed 20% more than a fully loaded F4U-4, and was capable of carrying 8,200lb of bombs. The AU-1 had a maximum speed of 238 miles per hour at 9,500ft, when loaded with 4,600lb of bombs and a 150-gallon drop-tank. [...] When loaded with eight rockets and two 150-gallon drop-tanks, maximum speed was 298mph at 19,700ft. [...] When not carrying external loads, maximum speed was 389mph at 14,000ft. [...] First produced in 1952 and used in Korea, and retired in 1957. [...] Re-designated from F4U-6.|$|E
2500|$|The P-38J was {{introduced}} in August 1943. The turbo-supercharger intercooler system on previous variants had been housed in the leading edges of the wings and had proven vulnerable to combat damage and could burst if the wrong series of controls were mistakenly activated. In the P-38J model, the streamlined engine nacelles of previous Lightnings were changed to fit the intercooler radiator between the <b>oil</b> <b>coolers,</b> forming a [...] "chin" [...] that visually distinguished the J model from its predecessors. While the P-38J used the same V-1710-89/91 engines as the H model, the new core-type intercooler more efficiently lowered intake manifold temperatures and permitted {{a substantial increase in}} rated power. The leading edge of the outer wing was fitted with [...] fuel tanks, filling the space formerly occupied by intercooler tunnels, but these were omitted on early P-38J blocks due to limited availability.|$|E
2500|$|The VB {{became the}} main {{production}} {{version of the}} Mark Vs. Along with the new Merlin 45 series the B wing was fitted as standard. As production progressed changes were incorporated, some of which became standard on all later Spitfires. Production started with several Mk IBs which were converted to Mk VBs by Supermarine. Starting in early 1941 the round section exhaust stacks were changed to a [...] "fishtail" [...] type, marginally increasing exhaust thrust. Some late production VBs and VCs were fitted with six shorter exhaust stacks per side, {{similar to those of}} Spitfire IXs and Seafire IIIs; this was originally stipulated as applying specifically to VB(trop)s. After some initial problems with the original Mk I size <b>oil</b> <b>coolers,</b> a bigger oil cooler was fitted under the port wing; this could be recognised by a deeper housing with a circular entry. From mid-1941 alloy covered ailerons became a universal fitting.|$|E
2500|$|Power {{came from}} a Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp two-row 18-cylinder radial engine {{producing}} 2,000hp (1,500kW)—the same engine that would power the prototype Vought XF4U-1 fighter to just over 400mph (644 kph) in October 1940—with the Double Wasp on the XP-47B turning a four-bladed Curtiss Electric constant-speed propeller of 146in (3.7m) in diameter. The loss of the AP-4 prototype to an engine fire ended Kartveli's experiments with tight-fitting cowlings, so the engine {{was placed in a}} broad cowling that opened at the front in a [...] "horse collar"-shaped ellipse. The cowling admitted cooling air for the engine, left and right <b>oil</b> <b>coolers,</b> and the turbosupercharger intercooler system. The engine exhaust gases were routed into a pair of wastegate-equipped pipes that ran along each side of the cockpit to drive the turbosupercharger turbine {{at the bottom of the}} fuselage about halfway between cockpit and tail. At full power, the pipes glowed red at their forward ends and the turbine spun at 21,300rpm. The complicated turbosupercharger system with its ductwork gave the XP-47B a deep fuselage, and the wings had to be mounted in a relatively high position. This was problematic since long-legged main landing gear struts were needed to provide ground clearance for the enormous propeller. To reduce the size and weight of the main landing gear struts and so that wing-mounted machine guns could be fitted, each main gear strut was fitted with a mechanism by which it telescoped out 9in (23cm) when extended.|$|E
2500|$|The Airacobra {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{production}} fighters to be conceived as a [...] "weapons system"; in this case the aircraft (known originally as the Bell Model 4) was designed to provide a platform for the 37mm T9 cannon. This weapon, which was designed in 1934 by the American Armament Corporation, a division of Oldsmobile, fired a 1.3lb (610g) projectile capable of piercing [...]8in (2cm) of armor at 500yd (450m) with armor-piercing rounds. The 200lb, 90-inch-long weapon had to be rigidly mounted and fire parallel to and close to the centerline of the new fighter. It would be impossible to mount the weapon in the fuselage, firing through the cylinder banks of the Vee-configured engine and the propeller hub as could be done with smaller 20mm cannon. Weight, balance and visibility problems meant that the cockpit could not be placed farther back in the fuselage, behind the engine and cannon. The solution adopted was to mount the cannon in the forward fuselage and the engine in the center fuselage, directly behind the pilot's seat. The tractor propeller was driven via a [...] drive shaft made in two sections, incorporating a self-aligning bearing to accommodate fuselage deflection during violent maneuvers. This shaft ran through a tunnel in the cockpit floor and was connected to a gearbox in the nose of the fuselage which, in turn, drove the three- or (later) four-bladed propeller via a short central shaft. The gearbox was provided with its own lubrication system, separate from the engine; in later versions of the Airacobra the gearbox was provided with some armor protection. The glycol-cooled radiator was fitted in the wing center section, immediately beneath the engine; this was flanked on either side by a single drum shaped oil cooler. Air for the radiator and <b>oil</b> <b>coolers</b> was drawn in through intakes in both wing-root leading edges and was directed via four ducts to the radiator faces. The air was then exhausted through three controllable hinged flaps near the trailing edge of the center section. Air for the carburetor was drawn in via a raised oval intake immediately aft of the rear canopy.|$|E
