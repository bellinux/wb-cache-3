Methods: Ninety patients with severe acute biliary pancreatitis {{were treated with}} CQCQD, and they {{were divided into two}} groups: early-treated group (54 patients treated with CQCQD within 3 days after the onset of severe acute biliary pancreatitis) and late-treated group (36 patients treated with CQCQD between 3 and 7 days after the onset of severe acute biliary pancreatitis). The complication incidence rate, <b>operation</b> <b>rate,</b> mortality rate and hospitalization period were examined. Results: The incidence rates of encephalopathy, infection and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were lower in the early-treated group than those in the late-treated group (P＜ 0. 05). The hospitalization periods of the early- and late-treated groups were (24. 9 ± 18. 4) days and (51. 6 ± 45. 9) days respectively (P＜ 0. 05). The general mortality rate was 14. 4 %. The mortality rate of the early-treated group (7. 4 %) was significantly lower as compared with that of the late-treated group (25. 0 %) (P＜ 0. 05). The <b>operation</b> <b>rate</b> of the early-treated group (11. 1 %) was also significantly lower as compared with that of the late-treated group (27. 8 %) (P＜ 0. 05).

Here we present two efficient, new antenna-coherent solutions: The Chirpolator and The Chimageator. We describe the equations governing both techniques and propose a number of novel optimizations. We compare the implementation costs of our techniques with classical methods using three criteria: the <b>operations</b> <b>rates</b> (1) before and (2) after the integrate-and-dump stage, and (3) the data rate directly after the integrate-and-dump stage. When compared with classical methods, our techniques excel in the regime of sparse arrays, where they both require substantially lower data rates, and The Chirpolator requires a much lower post-integrator <b>operations</b> <b>rate.</b> In general, our techniques require more pre-integrator operations than the classical ones. We argue that the data and <b>operations</b> <b>rates</b> required by our techniques are better matched to future supercomputer architectures, where the arithmetic capability is outstripping the bandwidth capability. Our techniques are, therefore, viable candidates for deploying on future interferometers such as the Square Kilometer Array. Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJS. 14 figures, 2 table...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} an SAR problem {{based on}} actual requirements {{set forth by}} NASA for a spaceborne application. The requirements for high resolution and high quality necessitate a data sampling rate of 7. 5 MHz.

40|$|BackgroundTo {{study the}} {{epidemiology}} of childhood intussusception and {{risk factors of}} recurrence and operation based on a nationwide data. MethodsChildren with hospitalization due to intussusception (ICD 9 : 560. 0) between 1998 and 2007 were identified from a national health insurance database. The incidence was calculated by age, sex, calendar year and month of admission. Recurrence and <b>operation</b> <b>rates,</b> duration and costs of hospitalization were analyzed. ResultsA total of 8217 intussusception-related hospitalizations were identified in 7541 children. The incidence of intussusception peaked between 3 and 36 months of age. Male -to-female incidence rate ratio increased from 1. 31 {{in the first year}} to 2. 52 in the ninth year of life. The overall recurrence and <b>operation</b> <b>rates</b> were 7. 9 % and 24. 9 %, respectively. In children less than 1 year old, the recurrence rate was 10. 1 %, which decreased to 5. 3 % in children over 3 years old. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that children receiving operation had a significantly lower risk of recurrence with an odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) of 0. 31 (0. 24 - 0. 41) after controlling for age and sex. There are significantly more cases occurring during the warmer months between May and October compared to the cooler months between November and April.

40|$|Background A {{national}} {{target for}} {{coronary artery bypass}} graft (CABG) operations of 300 per million population was established by the Department of Health in 1987. Regional Health Authorities were required in 1993 - 1994 to achieve this target. The 1990 - 1991 Regional all-ages CABG rate was 239 per million population. The North Western Region planned to devolve the purchasing of certain services, including cardiac surgery, to districts in April 1993. Three districts had provider units within their boundaries. No means existed for estimating the appropriate <b>operation</b> <b>rate,</b> according to need, for district populations. A method was therefore devised for calculating guideline targets. Methods Based {{on the assumption that the}} ischaemic heart disease standardized mortality ratio (IHD SMR) is a valid proxy of the need for CABG operations and using a linear regression model, the existing district IHD SMRs and IHD hospitalization rates were used to derive guideline targets for districts, taking account of the need to raise the average <b>operation</b> <b>rate</b> for the Region to 300 per million population. Further targets using alternative Poisson regression model and weighting formulae were also derived. Results The derived operation targets based on the linear regression model were lower than the existing <b>operation</b> <b>rate</b> in the three provider districts and in the biggest provider's two neighbours. In all other districts, except one, targets were higher than the existing number of operations. The two further analyses produced essentially similar results. Conclusions In the North Western Region wide variations in CABG operation rates existed. Access to CABG surgery in the North Western Region appears to depend on proximity to the provider districts. Operation rates should reflect need. This paper presents a method for deriving targets which take account of need...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{report the}} {{incidence}} of elective total hip replacement and postoperative mortality, emergency readmission rates, and the demographic factors associated with these rates in a large defined population. DESIGN [...] Analysis of linked, routine abstracts of hospital inpatient records and death certificates. SETTING [...] 10 hospitals in six districts in Oxford Regional Health Authority covered by the Oxford record linkage study. SUBJECTS [...] Records for 11, 607 total hip replacements performed electively in 1976 - 85. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Incidence of operation, postoperative mortality, relative mortality ratios, and incidence of emergency readmission. RESULTS [...] NHS <b>operation</b> <b>rates</b> increased over time from 43 to 58 operations/ 100, 000 population. Variation in <b>operation</b> <b>rates</b> between districts reduced over time. <b>Operation</b> <b>rates</b> were on average 25 % higher in women than men. There were 93 deaths (11 / 1000 operations) within 90 days of the operation and 208 emergency readmissions (28 / 1000 operations) within 28 days of discharge. Postoperative mortality and emergency readmission rates increased with age. No significant trend with time was found. Mortality in the 90 days after the operation was 2. 5 -fold higher (1. 9 to 3. 0) than {{in the rest of}} the first postoperative year. This represented an estimated excess of 6. 5 (4. 2 to 8. 8) early postoperative deaths/ 1000 operations. Most deaths were ascribed to cardiovascular events. Thromboembolic disease was the commonest reason for emergency readmission. CONCLUSIONS [...] The pronounced increase in operations in districts with initially low rates suggests a trend towards greater equity in the local provision of NHS hip arthroplasty. The early postoperative clusters of deaths attributed to cardiovascular disease and of readmissions for thromboembolic disease suggest that there is scope for investigating ways of reducing {{the incidence of}} major adverse postoperative events...|$|R

40|$|Backgrounds and Aim: One of the {{remuneration}} methods {{in the hospital}} system in Iran is per case, based on a classification system termed Global system (GS). The GS, supported by Irans Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME), was established in 1999 and is now used for cost reimbursement in the second- and third-levels of health care services. In this system, patients are classified into 60 categories, based on the most frequent surgical operations. However, it now appears, {{that there are many}} questions about this system. This study aims to compare the global <b>operations</b> reimbursement <b>rates</b> with actual costs in the Cancer Institute, Tehran, in 2003 and 2004. nMaterials and Methods: This survey was a retrospective, analytical-descriptive one aiming at comparing the global <b>operations</b> reimbursement <b>rates</b> with actual costs in 646 global operations carried out in the Cancer Institute in 2003 and 2004. The global-operations and actual-costs data were gathered from Hospital Information Systems (HIS) and High Council of Insurance annual regulations, respectively, and analyzed using SPSS 11. 5 software and the Wilcoxon non-parametric test. Results: The differences between the cost reimbursement <b>rates</b> of global <b>operations</b> and their actual costs were lower in 2004 as compared to those in 2003. Also, the actual costs of operations were higher than the global <b>operations</b> reimbursement <b>rates</b> in both years and the difference was significant statistically in either year (P< 0 / 001). Conclusion: Some of the MOHME and Cancer Institutes authorities and experts believe that the decrease in differences between the cost reimbursement <b>rates</b> of global <b>operations</b> and their actual costs in 2003 compred to 2004 is due to increased awareness of physicians and the accounting and discharge units personnel of the global operations and related regulations, as well as increasing global <b>operations</b> reimbursement <b>rates.</b> Also, they believe that the differences between the global <b>operations</b> reimbursement <b>rates</b> and their actual costs in either year could be attributed to not considering the actual inflation rate, hospital types, patients co-morbidities, etc. in calculating the global <b>operations</b> reimbursement <b>rates.</b> It is suggested to make more realistic calculations, taking into account such variables as the actual inflation rate, hospital types, patient co-morbidities, etc...|$|R
