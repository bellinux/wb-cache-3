25|$|In {{regards to}} the mere-exposure effect and {{decision}} making, Zajonc states {{that there has been}} no empirical proof that cognition precedes any form of decision making. While this is a common assumption, Zajonc argues that the opposite is more likely: decisions are made with little to no cognitive process. He equates deciding upon something with liking it, meaning that more <b>often</b> <b>we</b> cognize reasons to rationalize a decision instead of deciding upon it. Therefore, we make judgments first, and then seek to justify those judgments by rationalization.|$|E
25|$|Fairly {{straightforward}} statistics provide {{estimates of}} whether associations between genes on lists {{are greater than}} what one would expect by chance. These statistics are interesting, even if they represent a substantial oversimplification of {{what is really going}} on. Here is an example. Suppose there are 10,000 genes in an experiment, only 50 (0.5%) of which play a known role in making cholesterol. The experiment identifies 200 regulated genes. Of those, 40 (20%) turn out to be on a list of cholesterol genes as well. Based on the overall prevalence of the cholesterol genes (0.5%) one expects an average of 1 cholesterol gene for every 200 regulated genes, that is, 0.005 times 200. This expectation is an average, so one expects to see more than one some of the time. The question becomes how <b>often</b> <b>we</b> would see 40 instead of 1 due to pure chance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Often</b> <b>we</b> {{encompass}} {{the record of}} an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor {{has said that the}} defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate our defense we wish to remember this first point, we shall in our first background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. If we do not know him, we shall yet take some one to be our invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at once. And we shall place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left hand tablets, and on the fourth finger a ram's testicles (Latin testiculi suggests testes or witnesses). In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses.|$|E

25|$|Rather than {{identify}} differentially expressed genes using a {{fold change}} cutoff, {{one can use}} a variety of statistical tests or omnibus tests such as ANOVA, all of which consider both fold change and variability to create a p-value, an estimate of how <b>often</b> <b>we</b> would observe the data by chance alone. Applying p-values to microarrays is complicated by the large number of multiple comparisons (genes) involved. For example, a p-value of 0.05 is typically thought to indicate significance, since it estimates a 5% probability of observing the data by chance. But with 10,000 genes on a microarray, 500 genes would be identified as significant at p < 0.05 even if there were no difference between the experimental groups. One obvious solution is to consider significant only those genes meeting a much more stringent p value criterion, e.g., one could perform a Bonferroni correction on the p-values, or use a false discovery rate calculation to adjust p-values in proportion to the number of parallel tests involved. Unfortunately, these approaches may reduce the number of significant genes to zero, even when genes are in fact differentially expressed. Current statistics such as Rank products aim {{to strike a balance between}} false discovery of genes due to chance variation and non-discovery of differentially expressed genes. Commonly cited methods include the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and a wide variety of methods are available from Bioconductor and a variety of analysis packages from bioinformatics companies.|$|E

The reviewer added [...] " [...] <b>often</b> <b>we</b> are bombarded with wannabes [...] with weak vocals and insipid songs, [...] {{shows us that}} there is life after pop idol and with 'a little bit' of cred." [...] Music Week also gave a positive review, noting the song was [...] "catchy". However, Ian Hyland, writing for the Sunday Mirror was critical of the song, giving it a grade of 6 out of 10. He remarked that Ribbons [...] "fails" [...] at doing [...] "sexy R'n'B". Similarly, Julie MacCaskill of the Daily Record dismissed it as [...] "a lacklustre affair with the wannabe star ditching her Mariah sound- a-like singing in favour of becoming a Kylie clone". The single debuted at number nineteen on the UK Singles Chart, the week dated January 25, 2003. The position became its peak position. The following week, the song dropped to number thirty-seven and the week after exited the top forty.|$|E
500|$|Jean {{has stated}} that he [...] "does not know enough" [...] to say whether he approves of the {{legislation}} of medicinal marijuana, but none of The Simpsons writers use the drug. [...] "It's {{one of the most}} sober writing staffs I've ever encountered", staff writer Max Pross said in the episode's DVD commentary. When asked about what stance the episode holds regarding the legislation of medicinal marijuana, Jean said that series' staff wanted to explore both sides of the issue, rather than making an absolute statement. He added that the episode is rather a critique of legislations that are immediately criminalized after they are legitimized. [...] "The stance is that it seems ridiculous to legalize something and then criminalize it, which I have seen happen in various states", Jean said. He continued, [...] "It's just weird to take away a right or to grant people a liberty and then abandon it. I would say that's the strongest statement [...] makes." [...] The episode also criticizes the use of genetically modified foods. At the beginning of the episode, Marge announces that the family's dinner includes genetically modified vegetables, to which Lisa replies [...] "American corporations should stop playing god with nature." [...] She then notices that her potato starts eating her carrot. Even though the episode portrays genetic modifications in a negative light, none of The Simpsons writers were actually against the technique. After the scene was written, Reiss asked all the writers if they were against genetic modifications of food, and none of them were. [...] "Very <b>often</b> <b>we</b> take these stands on the show that we do not believe in at all", Reiss explained in the DVD commentary for the episode. The scene was originally three times longer, and was conceived during a rewrite session with the staff writers.|$|E
500|$|According to the Hindustan Times, Kaminey [...] "is {{the first}} attempt to deal with reality in a mature, matter of fact manner." [...] Unlike other Hindi films, in which the female lead is Sita, the protagonist is Rama and the {{antagonist}} is Ravana, the characters in Kaminey are nuanced humans in [...] "layered and complex" [...] situations. Namrata Joshi from Outlook wrote that Kaminey reflects Bhardwaj's [...] "enduring fascination for underdogs, characters {{on the margins of}} society and the morally compromised". Bhardwaj told Rediff.com that the film deals with [...] "themes that affect our lives directly", and [...] "is a reminder that we all have a dark side, and <b>often</b> <b>we</b> are not fully aware of that side". Rakesh Bedi from The Economic Times wrote, [...] "Bhardwaj presents the two warring brothers with speech defects. In today's world of logorrhea, communication is fraught with many dangers: misunderstandings, paranoias, recriminations, conflicts. Everyone speaks but no one understands. Bhardwaj gave the twins verbal impediments to show that the world has now been so hardwired to convoluted and calamitous communication that it needs silence or a speech defect to hash things out." [...] He continued, [...] "ith some glitches, Bhardwaj has almost re-birthed the Hindi film". The film also explores sex and sexuality, which according to Bedi were explored in a [...] "radically different and refreshing" [...] way, and the director [...] "daringly takes it a step further". When Sweety becomes pregnant, the couple [...] "decide to carry the pregnancy to term after a bit of hesitation. So she literally pushes her man into marriage. (Had Bhardwaj abjured marriage, {{it would have been a}} complete break but the nuptials were essential to the drama of the film.)" [...] The Daily Beast said that [...] "for aficionados of the Hindi-language genre, Kaminey is a revolutionary manifesto. It takes classic Bollywood tropes—estranged brothers, a case of mistaken identity, high drama approaching slapstick comedy—and presents them with Hollywood-style realism instead of Bollywood's wink-nudge mix of melodrama and posturing.|$|E
