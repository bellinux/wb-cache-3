5|$|A bodyline {{delivery}} was <b>one</b> <b>where</b> the cricket {{ball was}} bowled {{at the body}} of the batsman, in the hope that when he defended himself with his bat, a resulting deflection could be caught by one of several fielders standing close by. This was considered by critics to be intimidatory and physically threatening, {{to the point of being}} unfair in a game that was supposed to uphold gentlemanly traditions.|$|E
5|$|All were NAACP-sponsored cases. The Davis case, {{the only}} {{case of the}} five {{originating}} from a student protest, began when 16-year-old Barbara Rose Johns organized and led a 450-student walkout of Moton High School. The Gebhart case was the only <b>one</b> <b>where</b> a trial court, affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court, found that discrimination was unlawful; in all the other cases the plaintiffs had lost as the original courts had found discrimination to be lawful.|$|E

5|$|Back at the Eppes house, Charlie and Don {{discuss what}} went wrong. Alan is {{confident}} that the math is correct. Don tells Charlie that if Charlie ran his model on Don, the model will not show Don at his apartment. Instead, it would zone in on his office, where {{he spends most of}} his time. Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify his model to identify two hot zones, <b>one</b> <b>where</b> the suspect possibly resides and <b>one</b> <b>where</b> he possibly works. Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone, Don, Terry, and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim. After Don kills the suspect in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the suspect lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier. This revelation proves that Charlie's models are correct.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 7 {{discusses}} the fifth limb of yoga, Pratyahara, which {{it says is}} of five forms. This stage is <b>one</b> <b>where</b> {{the focus of the}} mind shifts from external stimuli received by sensory organs to various levels of internal awareness. The theory of Marma (joints) is presented, and 18 vital points inside one's body are listed that can be used as focal points to help initial stages of the meditative exercises.|$|E
5|$|Fielding {{started work}} on his fourth play, The Temple Beau, in April 1729, but did not finish {{until the end of}} the year. Rejected by his first theatre, the play had to be {{performed}} at another <b>one,</b> <b>where</b> it had 13 shows its first year and few revivals thereafter. The play is about Wilding, a young law student who gives up his studies to seek pleasure, and his attempts to marry a woman for her money. Fielding focuses on hypocrisy and gender equality in marriage with characters' interaction with Wilding.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{study the}} {{performance}} of a single-layer perceptron in realising a binary mapping of Gaussian input patterns. By introducing non-trivial correlations among the patterns, they generate a family of mappings including easier <b>ones</b> <b>where</b> similar inputs are mapped into the same output, and more difficult <b>ones</b> <b>where</b> similar inputs are mapped into different classes. The difficulty of the problem is gauged by the storage capacity of the network, which is higher for the easier problems...|$|R

5|$|He {{received}} the presbyterate {{in the first}} months of 1786, and was appointed for the Concepción parish, the same <b>one</b> <b>where</b> he was baptized. He also worked at the aforementioned House of Spiritual Works of Buenos Aires. He got the curacy of Magdalena on 12 September 1790, but resigned a year later because of health problems. He returned in 1793, and resigned definitively on 21 February 1794. After this, he moved to Maldonado. There are few historical records of his activities in those curacies.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo, {{which publishes}} the Pokémon video games, asked for changes {{to be made}} to the English {{adaptation}} of the episode. Some graphic sequences involving punching were taken out, including <b>one</b> <b>where</b> Misty slaps Ash on the cheek. The script was translated by Paul Taylor. Veronica Taylor, who provided the English voice of Ash in this episode, said she enjoyed the script and recording Ash's lines.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{mentions}} of fishers in literature occurred in The Audubon Book of True Nature Stories. Robert Snyder relates a tale of his encounter with fishers in the woods of the Adirondack Mountains of New York. He recounts three sightings, including <b>one</b> <b>where</b> he witnessed a fisher attacking a porcupine.|$|E

5|$|The Restaurant {{was later}} {{seen as the}} start of a {{movement}} in London wherein high-end restaurants were moved into hotels. This was followed in 1999 by Koffman moving La Tante Claire from its Royal Hospital Road location into The Berkeley hotel. The Restaurant's location in a hotel was thought at the time to have changed the mantra of not eating in a hotel-based restaurant to <b>one</b> <b>where</b> it was more openly acceptable.|$|E
5|$|The Somerset {{section is}} largely dry and is {{gradually}} {{disappearing into the}} landscape, {{as a result of}} roads improvements and ploughing, but a footpath has been established along much of its route, and archaeological excavations of the lift at Nynehead, the only <b>one</b> <b>where</b> there are still substantial remains, were carried out between 1998 and 2003 by the Somerset Industrial Archaeological Society.|$|E
5|$|The dollars were {{produced}} every year between 1878 and 1904 {{at a total}} of 4 different mints. Each mint, {{with the exception of}} Philadelphia, has its own mint mark.

5|$|The {{episode was}} a coup for Channel 4, who erected crush {{barriers}} outside their building {{to hold back}} fans when the cast arrived for a press conference (though no fans actually turned up). The broadcaster also commissioned a behind-the-scenes program from Princess Productions. Hosted by British television personality Johnny Vaughan, The <b>One</b> <b>Where</b> Johnny Makes Friends features comedic tongue-in-cheek interviews with all six main cast (Vaughan contacted Kudrow by payphone, claiming that he couldn't make international calls from his dressing room) and was broadcast on Channel 4 on May 6, 1998.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his tour}} of duty Nash had been wary of {{preferential}} treatment towards him due to his fame and opposed any attempts to promote him, which he believed he did not deserve. However, a jeep crash resulted in further injury to Nash's knees and ultimately led to a medical discharge from the Army on 18 February 1944. Following his return to Australia, Nash sold War Bonds and appeared at war-related charity functions, including <b>one</b> <b>where</b> he raised an additional £100 by singing to the large crowd.|$|E
5|$|After the mutineers sought {{asylum in}} Constanța, Romania, {{and after the}} Russians {{recovered}} the ship, its name was changed to Panteleimon. It accidentally sank a Russian submarine in 1909 and was badly damaged when it ran aground in 1911. During World War I, Panteleimon participated in the Battle of Cape Sarych in late 1914. It covered several bombardments of the Bosphorus fortifications in early 1915, including <b>one</b> <b>where</b> it was attacked by the Turkish battlecruiser Yavuz Sultan Selim – Panteleimon and the other Russian pre-dreadnoughts present drove it off before it could inflict any serious damage. The ship was relegated to secondary roles after Russia's first dreadnought battleship entered service in late 1915. It was by then obsolete and was reduced to reserve in 1918 in Sevastopol.|$|E
30|$|Reported studies verifying {{the effects}} of offset {{placement}} include <b>ones</b> <b>where</b> implant bodies were embedded in rectangular experimental models [11 – 14], <b>ones</b> <b>where</b> rectangular bone models were constructed with FEA models [15, 16], and <b>ones</b> <b>where</b> FEA models were constructed from CT data on human mandibles [17, 18]. The artificial mandible models {{used in the present}} study were type II in the Lekholm and Zarb classification [24] and created using clinically valid estimates of bone quality, bone structure, and bone morphology. If {{the effects of}} implant placement alone are being verified, then models that are simple in form can be used. However, artificial mandibles were {{used in the present study}} in order to take into account the constraints on offset amounts due to anatomical morphology, the differences in stress distribution in the surrounding bone due to bone morphology, and other aspects of clinical practice.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} episodes, profanity and soft-erotica (scantily-clad women) were more freely used than in later <b>ones,</b> <b>where</b> said content was {{somewhat}} watered down to suit younger viewers.|$|R
