Usually, the scheduled perturbations of the flow can be programmed for a future horizon. In this manner, the control action can also be programmed. This work, it shows a feedforward control algorithm that plans the gate trajectories when the demand at <b>offtakes</b> are programmed in a prediction horizon. The Hydraulic Influence Matrix (HIM) or matrix of sensibility of the hydrodynamic conditions in the canals to changes in the parameters of the gate trajectories is a tool that is shown very effective in the control of canals in open loop. The work defines the concept, it presents the form of to calculate and to compile the HIM starting from the complete equations of Saint-Venant in their characteristic form. Later on, it shows up an algorithm in that HIM is used: a feedforward controller algorithm so-called GoRoSo.

40|$|Information {{regarding}} the hunting activities of local residents {{is essential for}} solving sustainability problems in afro-tropical forests. We studied bushmeat hunting in two Community Hunting Zones (CHZs 13 and 14) located in the northern periphery of Boumba-Bek National Park in southeastern Cameroon. We monitored 899. 14 hunter-days in nine neighboring villages, {{over a period of}} 12 months. Animals were hunted in national parks and in logging and agroforestry zones. We recorded 587 carcasses of 38 species, for a total fresh biomass of 3. 46 tons. Ungulates and primates were the most heavily huntedhowever, the latter were primarily represented in CHZ 13, the zone with the most intensive hunting pressure. Reptiles and birds were fairly represented among <b>offtakes</b> (4. 36 %). Harvests varied considerably by species and CHZ. The blue duiker (41 %) and the putty-nosed monkey (15 %) were the most frequently captured. In contrast with the latter, the blue duiker was harvested at similar rates in all the villages, indicating its importance for local people. Hunters consumed 26. 7 % of their total catch with their families and sold 67. 8 %. The bushmeat trade, defined in terms of the proportion of animals sold, was positively correlated with the number of households. In both CHZs hunting was largely unsustainable for blue duikers. However, in CHZ 14 <b>offtakes</b> of red duikers were probably under sustainable harvest limit. Our analysis have implications for the development of adaptive wildlife management plans that could enhance sustainability in the region. Overhunting will not be solved, unless the bushmeat trade is tackled effectively...|$|R

The investigation into the two farming practices is being conducted on farmers' fields in 4 different locations, e. g., Daulatpur, Dhamrai Gabtali, and Shibganj in Bangladesh. This 3 -year investigation began in May 1997 and initially a soil survey was conducted with samples from the plough layer taken from all 4 locations.

40|$|We {{suggest an}} ethno-biological {{approach}} {{to analyze the}} cultural and social drivers of hunting activities and assess sustainability in villages near Makokou, northeast Gabon, {{based on interviews with}} hunters, participatory mapping of hunting territories, and daily records of <b>offtakes</b> for 1 yr. Hunting in villages of northeast Gabon is practiced for both local consumption and cash income to cover basic family expenses. There appears to be no clear tendency to abandon subsistence hunting for commercial hunting as in other regions of Africa. Cultural and socioeconomic factors explain the temporal and spatial variation in hunting activities. Hunting increases in the dry season during circumcision ceremonies, when it is practiced mainly at > 10 km from villages, and decreases during the rainy season because most hunters are occupied by other economic activities. Degraded forest such as secondary regrowth supplies 20 % of the animals killed and the greatest diversity of species at short distances from villages. Mature forest supplies the species with the greatest commercial value, e. g., red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), and is the preferred source of meat for traditional ceremonies. In the last 15 yr, hunting patterns have changed rapidly, mainly because of the spread of gun hunting, which had serious implications for the nature of <b>offtakes.</b> Our results suggest that there is potential to allow hunting for resistant species such as blue duiker (Cephalophus monticola) and African brush-tailed porcupine (Atherurus africanus). Other species such as red river hog and small diurnal monkeys require more attention. Specific management systems could be discussed in participatory hunting management plans to identify possible solutions to maintain the population levels of the more critical species...|$|R
40|$|Demand-based {{irrigation}} systems are operated according to {{crop water requirements}}. As crop water requirements remain variable throughout the growing season, the discharges in the canal also vary to meet demands. The irrigation system under study is a demand-based semi-automatic irrigation system, where flows in the main canal are automatically controlled and secondary canals manually operated. The main canal headworks have been equipped with the SCADA system with proportional integral (PI) discharge controllers and the canal itself has been provided with self-regulating AVIS/AVIO downstream control gates for flow regulation in the canal. The secondary canals have manually operated sliding gates, which are opened or closed as per crop water requirements of the command area following a crop-based irrigations operation (CBIO) schedule under which they remain closed for one week after one or several weeks open, depending upon water needs. The flow in the main canal is then automatically adjusted according {{to the number of}} open or closed secondary <b>offtakes.</b> These operations result in fluctuating flows in the main canal and if not properly planned can cause serious implications for canal safety and its hydrodynamic performance. The PI discharge controllers regulate discharge releases to the canal in order to satisfy demands. The proper selection of PI coefficients ensures system safety and efficient water delivery. The operation of the secondary canals also {{plays a key role in}} defining the performance of the automatic operations. The planned opening and closure of a cluster of <b>offtakes</b> ensures safety of the self-regulating structures and stability of the flows in the main canal. In this paper various options have been tested using hydrodynamic modelling and we found some optimal values of PI coefficients and defined some rules for secondary canal operations to enhance the operational performance and sustainability of downstream-controlled irrigation canals...|$|R
40|$|In the Sahel of West Africa, the productivities of rangelands, croplands and {{livestock}} are inextricably linked. Cattle, {{sheep and goats}} graze rangelands and crop residues, and their manure/urine is used to fertilize crops. Rangelands provide important feeds during the manuring period, resulting in a net nutrient transfer from rangelands to croplands. This paper examines the sustainability of nutrient transfers in integrated rangeland/cropland systems of the Sahel by examining the impact of grazing on rangeland vegetation structure and floristic composition, the impact of livestock on nutrient balances of rangelands and croplands, {{and the role of}} livestock in offsetting nutrient deficits through manuring. Rangeland nutrient balances are in equilibrium (inputs = <b>offtakes)</b> whereas croplands lack the internal capacity to replenish nutrient <b>offtakes</b> in grain (as food) and crop residues (as feed). Although soil nutrient mining is of general concern for the Sahel, local management practices of some farmers (e. g. corralling animals over-night on fields between cropping seasons, use of fertilizers) offset cropland nutrient deficits. The number of additional livestock, and their feed requirements needed to supply sufficient manure to offset cropland nutrient deficits, depend on rangeland and cropland productivity, livestock production goals, and management strategies of farmers. Livestock must be managed so they do not deplete the nutrient supply of rangelands in order to increase the manure supply for improving cropland productivity. Sustained rangeland productivity in the Sahel will depend largely on producing alternative feeds derived mostly from croplands. Land use and tenure policies that inhibit livestock mobility and, therefore, farmers' access to the manure of pastoralists herds, will greatly undermine the resilience of Sahelian rangelands, and increase the need for other external nutrient inputs such as fertilizers to prevent declines in soil fertility and crop yields...|$|R

40|$|Using data {{collected}} from two villages in Central Gabon, from August 2003 to March 2005, this thesis explores the place of hunting {{in the context of}} village livelihoods. Spatial information on trapping <b>offtakes</b> from 76 hunters over one year, combined with hunter interviews, provides a detailed analysis of village landscape use by hunters, and the biological and social factors influencing hunting behaviour. Whilst hunting is the main livelihood option for village men, hunters were predominantly from richer or middle-income households. However, household wealth is perceived to be more strongly related to ownership of plantations (managed by female members of the household) than to hunting. Although bushmeat was an important source of protein for families, a significant proportion of hunting incomes may not have benefited the household, as they were spent on luxury items. Investigation of commodity chain characteristics from forest to market highlights problems with the use of market data as an indicator of hunting sustainability; only 19 of the species in the original catch were represented in the animals destined for market, and three species accounted for 90 % of the individual animals sold. Analysis of individual trap success showed catch rates for these larger-bodied, commercial species were highest in traps furthest from the village, in good quality forest, with low hunting pressure. Hunting strategies and hunter distribution within the landscape were strongly related to hunter age, with hunters of middle age hunting further into the forest, investing more effort, and as a result gaining higher <b>offtakes.</b> The use of the landscape was influenced partly by catch rates, but also by changes in the fabric of the village community as old clan-based structures broke down.

40|$|The main {{rivers of}} Bangladesh are boon and bane for the country. They supply water and fertile sediments {{allowing}} multiple crops per year, hundreds of waterways for navigation, rich fish stock and habitat diversity. But especially the dynamic, unpredictable Brahmaputra influenced rivers erode fertile floodplain land with long established settlements, flood embankments, roads, {{and all other}} communal infrastructure. The high sediment load and resulting continuous shifting of river courses impedes navigation and the inflows into the important distributary <b>offtakes.</b> Stabilization of these largest and most unpredictable rivers on the planet presents a huge challenge. Bangladesh has systematically developed the technology and experience to stabilize longer reaches of riverbanks and has commenced towards a holistic approach to stabilizing the Brahmaputra System from the Assam border to the Bay of Bengal. Current developments are concentrated in the Flood and Riverbank Erosion Risk Management Investment Program, from which we present three recent key developments. First, we demonstrate phased gradual stabilization of the 60 km reach just upstream of the confluence with the Ganges following an adaptive approach, responding to massive riverbank erosion but also seizing the opportunities offered by the rivers during particular years towards systematic stabilization and land reclamation. Second, we show how an array of morphological prediction methods and mathematical models, developed over the past 25 years, {{is used for the}} planning and the design of interventions for stabilization. Third, we demonstrate our experiences with an innovative construction method for long guiding revetments, consisting of sand-filled geo-textile bags under water. Additionally, we discuss the feasibility, costs, benefits, environmental impacts and social impacts of river stabilization also with special attention to the pivoting role of stable distributary <b>offtakes</b> {{in the context of a}} wider river management plan.
