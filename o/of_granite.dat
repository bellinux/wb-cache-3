5|$|A mass <b>of</b> <b>granite</b> {{now in the}} Panamint Mountains intruded {{this complex}} 1400 mya. Pegmatic dikes and other widely spaced plutons <b>of</b> <b>granite</b> {{are also in the}} complex (a pluton is a large blob of magma deep {{underground}} and dikes are projections of that). Outcrops can be seen along the front of the Black Mountains in Death Valley and in the Talc and Ibex Hills. When the granite was being intruded, the west coast of North America ran through Eastern California and through an embayment that spread toward the Las Vegas Valley. This embayment, called the Amargosa aulacogen, had highlands north and south of it and {{was the result of a}} failed rift. Many thousands of feet of sediment filled the slowly subsiding basin.|$|E
5|$|Flint {{and brown}} or yellow brick is used extensively, both for {{buildings}} within the conservation area and in associated {{structures such as}} boundary walls and pavements. Some kerbs are <b>of</b> <b>granite,</b> limestone and flint, while some high-quality Yorkstone paving slabs survive, along with some red-brick pavements.|$|E
5|$|Ion {{absorption}} clays or Lognan clays are the weathering products <b>of</b> <b>granite</b> {{and contain}} only 1% of REEs. The final ore concentrate can contain {{as much as}} 8% yttrium. Ion absorption clays are mostly in southern China. Yttrium {{is also found in}} samarskite and fergusonite.|$|E

5|$|Coalhouse Fort is {{exceptionally}} well-preserved; {{it provides}} {{one of the}} finest surviving examples of a mid-Victorian armoured casemate fort. It has twelve casemates arranged in a semi-circle facing south and east towards the river, with an annexed open battery facing south-west. The casemates are faced with massive slabs <b>of</b> <b>granite</b> and have iron gun ports to protect the gunners from splinters dislodged by incoming fire.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} oldest exposed rocks in the area due to {{extensive}} metamorphism (alteration of rock by heat and pressure). Radiometric dating gives an age of 1,700million years for the metamorphism during the Proterozoic. About 1,400million years ago a mass <b>of</b> <b>granite</b> now in the Panamint Range intruded this complex. Uplift later exposed these rocks to nearly 500million years of erosion.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{nondestructive}} evaluation of distinct types <b>of</b> <b>granites</b> considering in-situ and laboratory conditions. The main aims of the paper consists of: (a) obtaining a better insight {{on the possibility of}} using simple nondestructive techniques such as ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and Schmidt hammer rebound hardness to predict mechanical properties; (b) assessment of roughness of surface of granites,weathering and size in the nondestructive indexes; (c) comparison between indirect and direct UPV. From an experimental campaign based on nondestructive techniques it was observed that natural roughness of surfaces influences the hardness <b>of</b> <b>granites,</b> particularly in weathered <b>granites.</b> Lower influence <b>of</b> the roughness was observed in the ultrasonic pulse velocity, especially in case <b>of</b> fresh <b>granites...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Chetco River {{flows through}} the ancient Klamath Mountain terrane, which is between 400 and 100million years old, the oldest rocks in Oregon. The Klamath {{microcontinent}} was originally located beneath the ocean near southern California before separating {{hundreds of millions of}} years ago. Plate tectonics pushed the microcontinent north, and bits <b>of</b> <b>granite,</b> sea floor sediment, subduction zones, and coral reefs gradually accreted into small islands. Between 212 and 170million years ago, a massive volcanic arc erupted on the Klamath microcontinent, binding the islands together in a single block. The Klamath microcontinent went through a period of intense tectonic activity known as the Siskiyou orogeny roughly 170 to 165million years ago. The process was strong enough to force sedimentary rocks deep into the Earth's crust, melting them into large plutons <b>of</b> <b>granite,</b> which rose slowly to the surface. Shortly after, a large portion of sea floor was thrust over the older Klamath terranes; much of it is still visible atop Vulcan and Chetco peaks. This region is known as the Josephine Ophiolite, and contains a rare type of rock called peridotite, originating from the Earth's mantle.|$|E
5|$|The island {{consists}} of varied geological provinces. In the far west, around County Galway and County Donegal, is a medium to high grade metamorphic and igneous complex of Caledonide affinity, {{similar to the}} Scottish Highlands. Across southeast Ulster and extending southwest to Longford and south to Navan is a province of Ordovician and Silurian rocks, with similarities to the Southern Uplands province of Scotland. Further south, along the County Wexford coastline, is an area <b>of</b> <b>granite</b> intrusives into more Ordovician and Silurian rocks, like that found in Wales.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} {{primarily}} composed <b>of</b> <b>granite</b> of 59.8 ± 0.4 – 58.4 ± 0.4 million years (from the Palaeocene epoch), with slate {{at the southern}} end; the plateau soil is mainly loam, with some peat. Among the igneous dykes cutting the granite are a small number composed of a unique orthophyre. This was given the name Lundyite in 1914, although the term– never precisely defined– has since fallen into disuse.|$|E

30|$|It is {{revealed}} that the age <b>of</b> the <b>granite</b> in the east is Jurassic because the mean direction <b>of</b> the east <b>granite</b> (D/I = 347.0 °/ 47.7 °, k = 40.2, α 95 = 3.6 °) {{is similar to the}} Jurassic direction of Korea Peninsula. The age <b>of</b> the <b>granite</b> in the west, however, is left undetermined whether it is Cretaceous or Jurassic because of the weak intensity and instability of the remanence <b>of</b> the <b>granite</b> during demagnetization treatments.|$|R
5|$|Access to {{the temple}} was located in the {{south-east}} corner of the enclosure wall. The entrance led to an open courtyard that stretched from east to west. The ritual cleaning and preparation of the offerings took place here. Because of the extensive degradation suffered by the temple, reconstruction attempts are somewhat speculative. From the ruins, archaeologists propose that the temple comprised an open colonnade, possibly made <b>of</b> <b>granite,</b> a sacrificial chapel adjoining the pyramid side, three statue niches and a few magazine chambers. No traces of a cult pyramid were found onsite. In {{the halls of the}} temple were depictions of animal processions and offerings carriers moving towards the Shrine of the Queen.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Shogunate's {{efforts to}} protect Japan from Western colonial forces, the defence of Hyogo Port was {{upgraded}} {{with the construction of}} the Wadamisaki Battery, one of six land batteries built around Osaka Bay under the design of Count Katsu Kaishū. It was completed in 1864 after 18 months of construction at a cost of 25,000 ryō. The outer enceinte was built <b>of</b> <b>granite</b> from the Shiwaku Islands and the inner two-storey structure was made of keyaki (Japanese elm) wood harvested from the Nunobiki and Tekkai Mountains in Kobe. In 1921 the battery was the first place in Hyogo Prefecture to be designated as a historic site by the prefectural government.|$|E
5|$|As the {{landscape}} rises, trees become {{smaller and more}} sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite. These include lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, and mountain hemlock that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses <b>of</b> <b>granite</b> as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as pika, yellow-bellied marmot, white-tailed jackrabbit, Clark's nutcracker, and black rosy finch are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.|$|E
50|$|Tectonically, greisen granites are {{generally}} associated with generation of S-type suites <b>of</b> <b>granites</b> in thick arc and back-arc fold belts where subducted sedimentary and felsic rock is melted.|$|R
30|$|Radioactive heat {{production}} data <b>of</b> <b>granites</b> <b>of</b> Gugi show high values {{on an average}} of 42.6  mW/m 2, which are similar to many other potentially viable areas around the world.

5|$|During the Hellenistic period, the {{sanctuary}} was {{extended from the}} base of the podium across the valley. To the east base of the podium stands a large chapel, , dating to the 4thcentury BC. The chapel was adorned with a paved pool and a large stone throne carved of a single block <b>of</b> <b>granite</b> in the Egyptian style; it is flanked by two sphinx figures and surrounded by two lion sculptures. The throne, attributed to the Sidonian goddess Astarte, rests against the chapel wall, which is embellished by relief sculptures of hunting scenes. The once important Astarte basin lost its function during the 2nd century AD and was filled with earth and statue fragments. The west base contains another 4th century BC chapel—centered on a bull protome topped capital—that remains preserved at the National Museum of Beirut.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, it was {{determined}} a new tower needed to be built and the new structure was completed in 1868. The new lighthouse was a keeper's quarters with an attached lantern on the roof. The structure is of the same design as lighthouses at Sheffield Island in Norwalk; Morgan Point in Noank; Old Field Point Light and Plum Island in New York; and Block Island North in Rhode Island. The dwelling is made <b>of</b> <b>granite</b> and the lantern made of cast iron. The original Fresnel lens was installed in the new tower. In 1890, a fog whistle was installed {{and it would be}} replaced by a siren in 1905. The siren caused much distress to nearby residents and had to be modified.|$|E
