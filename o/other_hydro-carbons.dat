40|$|Hand-held breath alcohol analyzers {{are widely}} used by police in traffic stops of drivers {{suspected}} of driving while intoxicated (DWI). E 85 is a motor fuel consisting of 85 % ethanol and 15 % gasoline or <b>other</b> <b>hydro-carbons,</b> and is available at nearly 2, 600 stations in the USA. We sought to determine whether handling E 85 fuel could produce measur-able breath alcohol results using a hand-held analyzer and {{to see if this}} would be a plausible explanation for a positive breath alcohol test. Five healthy adult subjects dispensed or transferred 8 US gallons of E 85 fuel in each of four scenarios. We measured breath alcohol con-centration in g/ 210 L of exhaled breath using the BACTrack S 50 at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15 and 20 min after each fuel-handling scenario. Most of the subjects had no detectable breath alcohol after handling E 85 motor fuel. Transient elevations (0. 02 – 0. 04 g/ 210 L) in breath alcohol meas-urement occurred up to 6 min after handling E 85 in a minority of sub-jects. We conclude that it is unlikely that handling E 85 motor fuel would result in erroneous prosecution for DWI...|$|E
40|$|Molecules vibrationally {{excited to}} near their {{dissociation}} threshold can undergo both bond dissociation and vib-rational relaxation, processes which {{play an important}} role in reaction dynamics. 1 - 5 Recent studies show that when the excited molecule is a large organic molecule, the average amount of energy transfer per collision is not very large. 4 - 9 The average energy transfer per collision between the highly vibrationally excited benzene and a noble gas atom is known to be about 30 cm− 1, which is much smaller than benzene derivatives such as hexafluorobenzene or <b>other</b> <b>hydro-carbons</b> such as toluene and azulene. 3, 10 - 13 For example, in the case of toluene + Ar, the amount of energy transfer is about − 200 cm− 1. 12 An important characteristic of vib-rational relaxation in a large molecule is intramolecular energy flow, which plays a key role in bond dissociation. Among such large molecules, toluene is a particularly attractive molecule for studying collision-induced intramole-cular energy flow and bond dissociation because of the presence of both methyl and ring C-H bonds, presenting an intriguing competition among them. In elucidating this com-petition, it is particularly important to understand the direc-tion of intramolecular energy flow in the interaction zone, i. e., from the ring C-H to the methyl C-H or the reverse. The purpose of this paper is to study the collision-induced dynamics of highly vibrationally excited toluene interacting with HBr using quasiclassical trajectory calculations. Using the results obtained in the calculations, we discuss the re-laxation of the excited CH vibration, and the time evolution of collision-induced intramolecular energy flow from the highly excited CH vibration. Finally, we elucidate the nature and mechanism of competition between methyl C-H mode and ring C-H mode in transferring energy to or from the incident molecule...|$|E
40|$|Trojans and Centaurs are primitive, {{peculiar}} objects orbiting in {{the middle}} solar system. Both groups characteristically have low albedos and red colors. Physical observations of Trojans reveal featureless reddish spectra, implying surfaces probably rich in complex organic solid materi-als. The interiors {{are expected to be}} rich in H 2 O ice and other volatile material. Centaurs have surfaces showing dramatically different spectral reflectances, from neutral to very red. Some spectra are featureless, while others show signatures of water ice, methanol, or <b>other</b> light <b>hydro-carbons.</b> Trojans were formed near Jupiter’s orbit, while Centaurs were formed far beyond Jupiter’s orbit, but both were formed at low temperatures at which water exists as solid ice. 1...|$|R
40|$|Thiophene is a tar {{component}} and {{is often}} present at sites contaminated by benzene {{that is one of}} the most widespread contaminants in soil and groundwater. Earlier research shows that thiophene is resistant to biological degradation, but it can be degraded cometabolically with benzene or <b>other</b> aromatic <b>hydro-carbons</b> as a primary substrate. This study summarises the available knowledge about the thiophene degradation (observed and predicted). This work considered the probable biodegradation of thiophene from petroleum spills under environment. The obtained results from the prediction of the biodegradation for the petroleum thiophene by the OECD (Q) SAR Application Toolbox system are restricted. Metabolites of the heterocyclic compound as thiophene based on observed microbial metabolism were not demonstrated, but six metabolites in the microbial metabolism simulator were predicted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fluorine-doped {{tin oxide}} (FTO) films on PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) {{substrate}} were {{prepared by the}} electron cyclotron resonance-metal organic chemical vapor deposition (ECR-MOCVD) under an Ar-O 2 -H 2 atmosphere. The used tin and fluorine precursor are TMT (tetramethyltin) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6), respectively. The hydrogen content {{plays an important role}} to control the optical and electrical characteristics of the films. The HF etching effect was clearly observed with increase of H 2 /TMT mole ratio, on the <b>other</b> hand the <b>hydro-carbon</b> deposition increased with decrease of H 2 /TMT mole ratio. Therefore the optimum H 2 content can be determined by the counter balance effect between HF etching and hydro-carbon deposition. The obtained optimum SnO 2 : F thin films exhibited over 90 % of optical transmittance at wavelength range from 380 to 780 nm and c. a. 6 × 10 - 3 ohm ·cm of electrical resistivity at 1. 25 H 2 /TMT mole ratio...|$|R
40|$|Previous work show- that heptane and {{isooctane}} {{not only}} cliffered greatly {{in respect to}} their susceptibilities to vapor-phase oxidation but {{that the nature of}} the oxidation products was also clifferent. These facts were interpreted {{on the basis of the}} temperature reqtired for OXL dative attack and on the thermal stability of the alkyl and pero ~ rtii-. cals obtained. This work has been extended to <b>other</b> aliphatic <b>hydro-carbons</b> in the present investigateion. d Experiments with 2, 2,~-trimethy~exane, which cliffers from isooctane in having one more methylene group, show that this compound occupies an intermediary positim between isooctane and n-heptane in susceptibility to oxidation. The addition of a methylene group reduces the resistivity of a hydrocarbon to oxidation. ‘The 2, 2 -dimethylbutane, which contafis two secondary C-H bonds, is more easily oxidized than its isomer, 2,S-dtiethylbutsae, which contains two tertiary C-H bonds. This appsrent anomaly may be due to the fact that tertiary C-H bonds in 2, 3 -dimethylbutme are sterically shielded from oxygen attack by the adjacent methyl groups. ~ the temperature range from 35 U 0 to 450 ° C 3 -heptene gave oxida-tion products similar to those from n-heptane but showed greater resist-ance to oxidative attack. At temperatures of ~ “ to 5500 C!, isobutene appeared slightly more susceptible to oxidation than isobutane. Possible emanations for these observations are suggested. When a reaction ttie with l/&inch inside diameter was used, iso-octane gave oxidaticm prducts similar to those previously reported with the l/ 16 -inch tube. However, for a given contact time the etient of reaction and the danger of explosion were much greater in the larger diameter tube. These results i,~ustrate the importance of a high surface-to-volmne ratio in controlling vapor-phase oxidation processes...|$|R
