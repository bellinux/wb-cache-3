5|$|The {{government}} {{tried to}} enforce a controversial media law that would see Clarín lose licenses and be forced to sell most of its assets. The law was initially sanctioned as a competition law for the media, but critics pointed {{out that it is}} only being used to further the campaign against Clarín. The government had little interest in enforcing measures of the law that were not related to Clarín. Clarín launched a constitutional challenge against some articles of the law with the judiciary. The government released an anti-Clarín advertisement claiming it refused to <b>obey</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and may be subverting democracy. The conflict led to disputes with the judiciary. Minister Julio Alak said that extending an injunction that allowed Clarín to keep its assets during the trial would be an insurrection, and it was rumored that judges who did not rule as the government wished might face impeachment. The court extended the inunction.|$|E

25|$|A counter {{argument}} to opponents of compulsory voting {{is that in}} these systems the individual still has the practical ability to abstain at the polls by voting informally if they so choose, due to the secrecy of the ballot. A spoilt vote does not count towards any political party and effectively {{is the same as}} choosing not to vote under a non-compulsory voting system. However, Singer argues that even the appearance of voluntary participation is sufficient to create an obligation to <b>obey</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
25|$|The LCMS {{believes}} that the Holy Scriptures contain two crucial teachings—the Law and the Gospel. The Law is all those demands in the Bible which must be obeyed {{in order to gain}} salvation. However, because all people are sinners, it is impossible for people to completely <b>obey</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law.</b> Therefore, the Law implies an inevitable consequence of God's wrath, judgment, and damnation. The Gospel, on the other hand, is the promise of free salvation from God to sinners. The Law condemns; the Gospel saves. Both the Law and the Gospel are gifts from God; both are necessary. The function of the law is to show people their sinful nature and drive them to the Gospel, in which the forgiveness of sin is promised {{for the sake of the}} death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|Peter Singer, in Democracy and Disobedience, {{argues that}} {{compulsory}} voting could negate {{the obligation of}} a voter to support {{the outcome of the}} election, since voluntary participation in elections is deemed {{to be one of the}} sources of the obligation to <b>obey</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> in a democracy. In 1996 Albert Langer was jailed for three weeks on contempt charges in relation to a constitutional challenge on a legal way not to vote for either of the major parties. Chong, Davidson and Fry, writing in the journal of the right wing think tank the CIS, argue that Australian compulsory voting is disreputable, paternalistic, disadvantages smaller political parties, and allows major parties to target marginal seats and make some savings in pork-barrelling because of this targeting. Chong et al. also argue that denial is a significant aspect of the debate about compulsory voting.|$|E

25|$|According to Mendhenhall, {{pressures}} from outside invaders led the loosely bound Israelite tribes to converge into monarchical unity for stability and solidarity. He {{also argues that}} during this consolidation, the new state also had to unify the religious traditions {{that belonged to the}} different groups to prevent dissent from those who might believe that the formation of a state would replace direct governance from God. Therefore, Mendenhall continues, these loosely bound tribes merged under the Mosaic covenant to legitimize their unity. They believed that to <b>obey</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> was to obey God. They also believed that the king was put into power as a result of God's benefaction, and that this accession was the fulfillment of God's promise of dynasty to David. Mendenhall also notes that a conflict arose between those who believed in the Davidic covenant, and those who believed that God would not support all actions of the state. As a result, both sides became relatively aloof, and the Davidic covenant and the Mosaic covenant were almost entirely forgotten.|$|E
25|$|The {{warships}} Niterói and Piranga {{led by the}} British Captain John Taylor {{were sent}} to Recife to compel the Liberals to <b>obey</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> without success. The Liberals vehemently refused to bring back Paes Barreto and boasted: “We shall die! Let Pernambuco be destroyed! There will be war!”. Frei Caneca, José da Natividade Saldanha and João Soares Lisboa (that had recently returned from Buenos Aires) were the intellectuals behind the rebellion and desired to preserve {{the interests of the}} gentry that they represented. Although Recife (or to be more precise, the Liberals) had clearly rebelled, Pedro I tried to prevent a conflict that he considered unnecessary and appointed a new president the province, José Carlos Mayrink da Silva Ferrão. Mayrink was natural of the province of Minas Gerais, but was related to the Liberals and it could act as a neutral entity to conciliate the two local factions. However, the Liberals did not accept Mayrink, which made him return to Rio de Janeiro. The rumors of a great Portuguese naval attack (Brazil was still in war for its independence) compelled John Taylor to leave Recife.|$|E
500|$|Raz {{expressed}} a similar view. Expanding {{on the concept}} in a 1977 article, he said that, in its broadest sense, {{the rule of law}} means that people should <b>obey</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and be ruled by it. On the other hand, a narrower construction {{of the rule of law}} means that the government shall be ruled by and subjected to the law. The doctrine of the rule of law also requires that [...] "the making of particular laws should be guided by open and relatively stable general rules".|$|E

In 1900 Eddy advised adherents to <b>obey</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> [...] "and then appeal to the gospel to save... from any bad results." [...] In October 1902, after seven-year-old Esther Quimby, the daughter of Christian Scientists, died of diphtheria in White Plains, New York (she had received no medical care and had not been quarantined), the authorities pursued manslaughter charges. The controversy prompted Eddy to declare that [...] "until public thought becomes better acquainted with Christian Science, the Christian Scientists shall decline to doctor infectious or contagious diseases," [...] and from that time the church required Christian Scientists to report contagious diseases to health boards.|$|E

South Park and Contemporary Culture, and Taking South Park Seriously have also analyzed Cartman's perspectives {{within the framework of}} popular philosophical, theological, political, and social concepts. Parker and Stone downplay the show's alignment with any particular political affiliation, and deny having a political agenda when creating an episode. In response to the focus on elements of satire in South Park, Parker has said that the main goal of the show is to portray Cartman and his friends as [...] "kids just being kids" [...] as a means of accurately showcasing [...] "what it's like to be in [...] in America".|$|E

500|$|The members worked {{together}} and shared all property. If {{a member of}} the society needed money for some purpose, they were free to take it from a community supply. Women of the society worked in the house sewing, setting type for newsletters, and general housework, while the men worked the farm. One of the founding principles of the society was that of the [...] "free gift". It dictated that, if anyone wanted something that they had to give—printed materials in particular—they had only to ask and it would be given to them without charge. After reading or seeing the society in practice, those people were free to contribute if they wished, but it was stressed that this was a [...] "free gift" [...] and not payment. In order to rise from their lower, selfish nature into an unselfish, spiritual nature, the society taught, everyone should <b>obey</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of their being and subdue passions and impulses that control them by nature. The society believed in business and societal laws, but they felt that man would rise above those laws when they gained full control of their lower nature. They maintained, however, that they should still be obedient to those laws.|$|E
500|$|Taft {{began the}} {{campaign}} on the wrong foot, fueling the arguments of those {{who said he was}} not his own man by traveling to Roosevelt's home at Sagamore Hill for advice on his acceptance speech, saying that he needed [...] "the President's judgment and criticism". Taft supported most of Roosevelt's policies. He argued that labor had a right to organize, but not boycott, and that corporations and the wealthy must also <b>obey</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> Bryan wanted the railroads to be owned by the government, but Taft preferred that they remain in the private sector, with their maximum rates set by the Interstate Commerce Commission, subject to judicial review. Taft attributed blame for the recent recession, the Panic of 1907, to stock speculation and other abuses, and felt some reform of the currency (the U.S. was on the gold standard) was needed to allow flexibility in the government's response to poor economic times, that specific legislation on trusts was needed to supplement the Sherman Antitrust Act, and that the constitution should be amended to allow for an income tax, thus overruling decisions of the Supreme Court striking such a tax down. Roosevelt's expansive use of executive power had been controversial; Taft proposed to continue his policies, but place them on more solid legal underpinnings through the passage of legislation.|$|E
