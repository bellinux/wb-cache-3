What do these people know, what do they realize, of the pressure and beat of raw life that lies behind--what do even I, who have seen this prisoner, know?

Increased security requirements are a product of the paradigm shift in security for Mega-Event locations. This study examined the Indianapolis Motor Speedway during Mega-Event status events, with specific focus on the 2013, Indianapolis 500 automobile race. The objective was to study the phenomenon of pedestrian flow as it related to entry gate procedures and resulting impacts. This data was then used to compile modeling scenarios employing AnyLogic computer software that allowed for free-agent, variable play to replicate the conditions of the security processing. Through manipulation of agent variables the researcher was able to determine the optimal pedestrian throughput under maximum load conditions.

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{growth of}} the number of cyber attacks along with the massive increase of mobile devices creates a highly heterogeneous landscape in terms of security challenges. We argue that in <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>security</b> researchers to cope with both the massive amount and the complexity of attacks, a more pro-active approach has to be taken into account. In ad-dition, distributed attacks that are carried out by intercon-nected attackers require a collaborative defense. Diverging from traditional security defenses, honeypots are systems whose value lies on in being attacked and compromised. In this paper, we extend the idea of HosTaGe, i. e., a low inter-action honeypot for mobile devices. Our system is specif-ically designed in a user-centric manner and runs out-of-the-box in the Android operating system. We present the design rational and discuss the different attack surfaces that HosTaGe is able to handle.

40|$|Events {{such as the}} Aum Shinrikyo's sarin gas {{attack on}} the Tokyo subway in March 1994 have placed {{terrorism}} {{at the top of}} the post‐Cold War security agenda and have caused policy makers to sense qualitative change and new dangers in the terrorist threat to industrialised societies. By examining the case of the Aum Shinrikyo and comparing it in detail with Japanese terrorism during the Cold War period, this article demonstrates that terrorism has indeed undergone qualitative change in the 1990 s due to terrorism's enhanced non‐specificity, expansion in destructive potential, greater erosion of the barriers between internal and external security, and ability to corrode the legitimacy of existing security institutions. The article then goes on to argue that Aum's characteristics as a terrorist phenomenon reflect the nature of the post‐Cold War security agenda as a whole, and that the policy lesson of the Tokyo subway attack is that, in the 1990 s, in <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>security</b> institutions to detect new security challenges early enough and to deal with them they need to discard Cold War mindsets and to sustain the process of internal reform...|$|E

40|$|Privacy {{and data}} protec-tion are among theprime {{problems}} of theinformation society. Many {{of us are}} con-cerned {{by the fact that}} elec-tronic data about us can be used for purposes beyond our control. Privacy therefore has a close relationship with security. If data about us is not secure then this can threaten privacy. This line of argument suggests that priva-cy requires security. A some-what contradictory argument would be that, in <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>security</b> to be guaranteed, we need to limit privacy. If all information about everyone were known, then security threats would be much easier to address and sanction. In this scenario, privacy and security seem to be mutually exclusive. This confusing and contradictory starting point {{for a discussion of the}} relationship between privacy and security is exacerbated by a number of aspects. It is not really clear what consti-tutes privacy, nor do we have a generally agreed-upon def-inition of security. There is also no agreement on how these two con-cepts are to be protected (by ethics, the law, markets, or other mecha-nisms) or who should assume responsibility for them (the state, the individual, organizations, etc.) [62].

40|$|In {{an age of}} {{zero-day}} exploits {{and increased}} on-line attacks on computing infrastructure, operational security practitioners are becoming increasingly aware {{of the value of}} the information captured in log events. Analysis of these events is critical during incident response, forensic investigations related to network breaches, hacking attacks and data leaks. Such analysis has led to the discipline of Security Event Analysis, also known as Log Analysis. There are several challenges when dealing with events, foremost being the increased volumes at which events are often generated and stored. Furthermore, events are often captured as unstructured data, with very little consistency in the formats or contents of the events. In this environment, security analysts and implementers of Log Management (LM) or Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems face the daunting task of identifying, classifying and disambiguating massive volumes of events in <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>security</b> analysis and automation to proceed. Latent Semantic Mapping (LSM) is a proven paradigm shown to be an effective method of, among other things, enabling word clustering, document clustering, topic clustering and semantic inference. This research is an investigation into the practical application of LSM in the discipline of Security Event Analysis, showing the value of using LSM to assist practitioners in identifying types of events, classifying events as belonging to certain sources or technologies and disambiguating different events from each other. The culmination of this research presents adaptations to traditional natural language processing techniques that resulted in improved efficacy of LSM when dealing with Security Event Analysis. This research provides strong evidence supporting the wider adoption and use of LSM, as well as further investigation into Security Event Analysis assisted by LSM and other natural language or computer-learning processing techniques.

In <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>security</b> practitioners to know how to protect themselves against new attacks, it is important for them to know how the hackers work and think. Therefore, we have described the hacker environment, tried to map how many they are, how they find information, and how they share information. Vulnerabilities and denial of service are considered to be the main parts of the report, with a model to each case. To get an overview over vulnerabilities and factors that influence vulnerabilities, a system dynamics model is discussed. The model shows variables like vulnerable hosts, patching, hackers with or without scripts, sophisticated and nonsophisticated hackers, attacks, and attack frequency. This is an overall description of a single vulnerability problem, but the problem with multiple vulnerabilities is also briefly discussed. Some of the biggest threats when it comes to information security today are denial of service (DoS) attacks and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. DoS and DDos attacks are possible to be the most potent and difficult to tackle, and they can do enormous damages. These types of attacks are described, and we use and discuss a model over a specific denial of service case. The case is about a turf war between the two German hackers “Mixter” and “Randomizer”, and the model includes variables that are specific to the case, and variables that are more general about hackers and the Internet world.
