5|$|At {{the time}} the penalty was taken, the Welsh dugout was {{surrounded}} by press and photographers, as the home team were still leading 1–0. With the scores levelled, the pack switched {{their attention to the}} Scottish bench, which led to Stein remonstrating with at least one photographer to move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> his view of the game. Both Professor Stewart Hillis, the Scotland team doctor (who was also Stein's consultant), and Welsh manager Mike England stated that there appeared to be nothing wrong at this point.|$|E
5|$|After Hōshō was commissioned, {{experienced}} aircrews requested changes, and {{the ship}} was modified by the Yokosuka Navy Arsenal from 6 June to 20 August 1924. The island, tripod mast, and aircraft crane were removed since they partially obstructed the flight deck and obscured pilot visibility. The forward part of the flight deck was made horizontal, and the 8cm AA guns were moved forward, close {{to the position of}} the former island and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> landing operations. After the island was removed, the carrier's flight operations were controlled from a platform extending {{from the side of the}} flight deck, a design that would be repeated in subsequent Japanese aircraft carriers. The ship was then assigned to the 1st Fleet until 15 November 1924.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{approaches}} {{to reduce the}} effect of bird strikes. The vehicles can be designed to be more bird resistant, the birds can be moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle, or the vehicle can be moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the birds.|$|E

25|$|If {{the batter}} is {{hit by a}} pitch, the batter gets walked automatically. However, if the batter does not make {{an attempt to get}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the pitched ball, the home-plate umpire may {{continue}} the at-bat.|$|E

25|$|It {{is up to}} {{the umpires}} to keep <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> both the ball and the players. In particular, if the ball is hit and the players attempt a run, then the umpire behind the stumps will {{generally}} retreat to the side, in case the fielding side attempts a run out at that end.|$|E
25|$|Joyce {{suffered}} a unique dismissal in a 2009 Championship game against Warwickshire. He swept a ball from Ant Botha straight into short-leg fielder Jonathan Trott's pocket. Trott {{had turned his}} back and leapt <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the ball; he was stunned to find the ball lodged in his right pocket. He became Sussex captain on 31 July 2012, succeeding Michael Yardy.|$|E
25|$|The {{parallel}} {{chains of}} stretched rubber {{are susceptible to}} crystallization. This takes some time because turns of twisted chains have to move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the growing crystallites. Crystallization has occurred, for example, when, after days, an inflated toy balloon is found withered at a relatively large remaining volume. Where it is touched, it shrinks because {{the temperature of the}} hand is enough to melt the crystals.|$|E

25|$|At Brisbane, on a wicket {{that was}} the worst that I have ever seen, the Yorkshireman was superb. The head-high bouncer was safely ignored. The chest-high {{deliveries}} of both the pace men and the spinners were played safely to the ground, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the many grasping hands in the leg-trap, and Hutton's display was a perfect lesson in the art of batsmanship...that will long remain in my memory, being by far the best innings I have ever seen played.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, {{the most}} {{extensive}} restoration took place to the dome during {{the era of the}} Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1915 (1333/1334AH). To facilitate crowd control, the building housing the Zamzam was moved away from its original location, to get it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the Tawaf, when millions of pilgrims would circumambulate the Kaaba. The water of the well is now pumped to {{the eastern part of the}} mosque, where it was made available in separate locations for men and women.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} muntjac deer living principally on Norton Common, but also {{increasingly}} {{elsewhere in the}} town (Jackman's Estate, for example where they often leave evidence of their presence on the allotments, much to the annoyance of allotment holders!). About {{the size of a}} large dog, they also find their way to domestic gardens and have been seen occasionally in the town centre. They can be something of a traffic hazard, especially on winter evenings, as they do not readily move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> cars.|$|E

25|$|The {{walls of}} the set were on rollers and could silently be {{moved out of the}} way {{to make way for the}} camera and then {{replaced}} when they were to come back into shot. Prop men constantly had to move the furniture and other props <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the large Technicolor camera, and then ensure they were replaced in the correct location. A team of soundmen and camera operators kept the camera and microphones in constant motion, as the actors kept to a carefully choreographed set of cues.|$|E
25|$|Most bridges {{are fixed}} bridges, meaning {{they have no}} moving parts and stay in one place until they fail or are demolished. Temporary bridges, such as Bailey bridges, are {{designed}} to be assembled, and taken apart, transported to a different site, and re-used. They are important in military engineering, and are also used to carry traffic while an old bridge is being rebuilt. Movable bridges are designed to move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> boats or other kinds of traffic, which would otherwise be too tall to fit. These are generally electrically powered.|$|E
25|$|The last {{function}} of the IU was to command the very small maneuver necessary to keep the S-IVB/IU <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the spacecraft. On some missions the S-IVB/IU went into high Earth or Solar orbit, while on others it was crashed into the Moon; seismometers were left on the Moon during Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16, and the S-IVB/IUs of Apollo 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 were directed to crash. These impacts provided impulses that were recorded by the seismometer network to yield information about the geological structure of the Moon.|$|E

25|$|Drivers often flash {{headlights}} {{to indicate}} the intention to overtake or pass another driver, or to signal a driver who has just overtaken {{that he or she}} is far enough ahead to change back into the lane of the overtaken vehicle. Flashing is also commonly used to request or insist that a leading driver speed up or change lanes to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> a faster following driver. Headlight flashing may also be a part of aggressive driving, and can be used in an attempt to intimidate others into speeding or otherwise driving unsafely.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the Portuguese Armed Forces saw {{themselves}} {{confronted with the}} paradox generated by the dictatorial regime of the Estado Novo {{that had been in}} power since 1926: on the one hand, the policy of Portuguese neutrality in World War II placed the Portuguese Armed Forces <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> a possible East-West conflict; on the other hand, the regime felt the increased responsibility of keeping Portugal's vast overseas territories under control and protecting the citizenry there. Portugal joined NATO as a founding member in 1949, and was integrated within the various fledgling military commands of NATO.|$|E
25|$|The {{individuals}} in each colony {{can usually be}} separated into three groups: on the nest, next to the nest, or absent from the nest. Those {{who are on the}} nest usually consist of the dominant reproductive female, queens, and those caring for the brood or taking care of the nest. If more than one reproducing female is present in a nest, the less dominant one either stays on a smaller comb or remains next to the nest <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the dominant individual. Non-reproductive individuals can reside in all three groups, but they usually remain either next to the nest or absent from the nest foraging for food. If they are on the nest, the dominants often force these subordinates onto smaller combs.|$|E
50|$|Abramoff, Ralph Reed, and Grover Norquist persuaded Moritz to drop <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race by {{promising}} her <b>the</b> appointed position <b>of</b> executive director.
