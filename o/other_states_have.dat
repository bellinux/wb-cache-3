Amendments ratified by the voters reduced the voting age to eighteen to conform with the Twenty-sixth Amendment, removed residency requirements for voting, and conformed voter registration to the Motor Voter Act. A legislative session now may be called after a Governor's veto. Virginia joined thirty-two other states in 1996 by amending its Constitution to provide for rights of victims of crime.

25|$|Speed {{limits in}} Texas, Utah, and Rhode Island are prima facie.

For example, speed limits in California up to 55mph, or 65mph on highways, are prima facie, and those at or above those speeds are absolute.|$|E
25|$|Some {{states have}} a surplus of nurses while other states face a shortage. This is due to {{factors such as the}} number of new {{graduates}} and the total demand for nurses in each area. Some states face a severe shortage (such as the northwestern states, as well as Texas and Oklahoma), while <b>other</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> a surplus of registered nurses.|$|E

25|$|In most democracies, {{eligible}} voters {{can vote}} in elections of representatives. Voting on issues by referendum {{may also be}} available. For example, in Switzerland this is permitted {{at all levels of}} government. In the United States, some states such as California and Washington have exercised their shared sovereignty to offer citizens the opportunity to write, propose, and vote on referendums and initiatives; <b>other</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> not. The United States federal government does not offer any initiatives at all.|$|E
25|$|Legislation and {{re-engineering}} of interconnected crossings {{across the}} state of Illinois combined with greater awareness elsewhere resulted in efforts to help to prevent similar crashes from recurring. Informational decals were also added to Illinois school buses advising drivers {{of the length of}} each bus, since the substitute school bus driver was apparently unaware of the exact length of the bus she was driving. <b>Other</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> also embraced that and related aspects and incorporated them into their school bus driver training curriculum.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the promise}} of {{competitive}} markets to lower consumer prices, for the most part, has yet to materialize. Data from the United States, for example, indicates that while Pennsylvania and Connecticut have fairly stable residential prices since restructuring, most <b>other</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> witnessed price increases after the year 2000. While this may be good news in terms of conservation and demand-side management (C) objectives, it has made competitive markets unpopular among consumers and politically troublesome. For example, as consumer prices rose during Ontario's experiment with deregulation, Premier Ernie Eves, under surmounting political pressure, intervened into the market by freezing retail prices in November 2002.|$|E

25|$|Other {{commentators}} including world statesmen such as Manmohan Singh and Guido Mantega {{suggested a}} currency war was indeed underway {{and that the}} leading participants are China and the US, though since 2009 many <b>other</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> been taking measures to either devalue or at least check the appreciation of their currencies. The US does not acknowledge that it is practicing competitive devaluation and its official policy is to let the dollar float freely. While the US has taken no direct action to devalue its currency, there is close to universal consensus among analysts that its quantitative easing programmes exert downwards pressure on the dollar.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason why}} the {{citizens}} of New York will pay so large {{a part of the}} tax is New York City is the chief financial and commercial centre of a great country with vast resources and industrial activity. For many years Americans engaged in developing the wealth of all parts of the country have been going to New York to secure capital and market their securities and to buy their supplies. Thousands of men who have amassed fortunes in all sorts of enterprises in <b>other</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> gone to New York to live because they like the life of the city or because their distant enterprises require representation at the financial centre. The incomes of New York are in a great measure derived from the country at large. A continual stream of wealth sets toward the great city from the mines and manufactories and railroads outside of New York.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} no Naval or Marine Corps {{components}} of the National Guard of the United States, there is a Naval Militia authorized under federal law.. Like the soldiers and airmen in the National Guard of the United States, members of the Naval Militia are authorized federal appointments or enlistments {{at the discretion of}} the Secretary of the Navy.. To receive federal funding and equipment, a state naval militia must be composed of at least 95% Naval Reservists or Marine Corps Reservists. As such, some states maintain such units. Some states also maintain naval components of their State Defense Force. Recently, Alaska, California, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, Texas and Ohio have had or currently maintain naval militias. <b>Other</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> laws authorizing them but do not currently have them organized. To receive federal funding, {{as is the case in}} the National Guard, a state must meet specific requirements such as having a set percentage of its members in the federal reserves..|$|E
