40|$|The {{inorganic}} {{antireflection coating}} (AR 3 -chromium oxide) commonly used on photomask blanks {{was designed to}} minimize flare in h-line (405 nm) lithography steppers. The reflection of light (flare) off this coating (air-photomask) increases with shorter exposure wavelengths. High levels of flare occur in 248 nm and 193 nm IC steppers due to reflections off of the photomask surface. The reflections (standing waves) in photomask resists also increase during exposure using lower wavelengths of light. Lithography simulations and photomask manufacturing trials have led to resist processes that can generate sub- 0. 30 micron resist features on photomasks with I-line <b>optical</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>generators</b> (ALTA 3500). Lower developer concentration, higher exposure doses and the minimization of standing waves by incorporating a post-exposure bake and / or organic antireflection coatings (ARC) maximizes resolution. High resolution photoresists show standing waves on photomasks fabricated with <b>optical</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>generators.</b> Low contrast resist processes show only small standing waves or in certain cases resist “footing. ” The use of organic antireflection coatings can minimize standing waves and allow the use of high contrast resist processes. ARCs reduce the swing ratio, which improves linewidth uniformity. ARCs also improve the adhesion of the resist to the photomask surface. Simulations reveal that the optimal ARC coating thickness is around 46 nm for typical I-line systems and around 50 nm for 257 nm non-chemically amplified photomask resists. Preliminary I-line photomask manufacturing trials have been done with bottom antireflection coatings at the DPI Reticle Technology Center. The first process trials reveal tha...|$|R

40|$|Optical {{processors}} have {{potentially a}} major advantage over electronic processors {{because of their}} tremendous bandwidth. Massive parallelism is another inherent advantage of optical processors. However, it is traditionally demonstrated with free space components and seldom used for integrated optical signal processing. In this thesis, we consider spatial domain signal processing in guided wave structures, which brings {{a new dimension to}} the existing serial signal processing architecture and takes advantage of the parallelism in optics. A novel class of devices using holograms in multimode channel waveguides is developed in this work. Linear optical signal processing using multimode waveguide holograms (MWHs) is analyzed. We focus on discrete unitary transformations {{to take advantage of the}} discrete nature of modes in multimode waveguides. We prove that arbitrary unitary transformations can be performed using holograms in multimode waveguides. A model using the wide-angle beam propagation method (WA-BPM) is developed to simulate the devices and shows good agreement with the theory. The design principle of MWH devices is introduced. Based on the design principle, BPM models are used to design several devices including a mode-order converter, a Hadamard transformer, and an <b>optical</b> <b>pattern</b> generator/correlator. <b>Optical</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>generators</b> are fabricated to verify the theory and the model. Also, the bandwidth and fabrication tolerance of MWH devices are also analyzed. Also, we examine the nonlinear optical switches which allow the integration of MWHs into modern optical communication networks. A simple optical setup using an imaged 2 -D phase grating is developed for characterization of the complex third-order nonlinearity chi (3) to identify suitable nonlinear materials for integrated optical switches. This technique provides a reliable way to characterize chi (3) as new materials are constantly being developed. Finally, we demonstrate the concept of optical switching using XPM in segmented semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA) based on the proven technology of semiconductor waveguides. Segmented SOA switches allow the counter-propagation of control and signal pulses in the switch and avoid the problem of parasitic oscillations encountered in high gain SOA switches. A prototype device is experimentally characterized to demonstrate the concept, and a model is developed to obtain optimal parameters for future devices...|$|R

40|$|The central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> for {{swimming}} Xenopus embryo is organized as two half-centres linked by reciprocal inhibition. Microelectrode recordings suggest that Xenopus neurons are poorly excitable, necessitating {{a key role}} for postinhibitory rebound {{in the operation of}} the central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator.</b> However the Xenopus central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> seems unusual in that the component neurons apparently have no intrinsic or conditional rhythmogenic properties. We have re-examined the firing properties of Xenopus embryo spinal neurons by making patch-clamp recordings in situ from intact spinal cord. Recordings made from 99 neurons were divided into three groups. Central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> neurons overwhelmingly (44 / 51) fired trains of action potentials in response to current injection. Just over half of the sensory interneurons (13 / 22) also fired trains of action potentials. Neurons that received no synaptic inputs during swimming mostly fired just one or two action potentials (22 / 26). Thirty-four neurons were identified morphologically. Commissural (8 / 12) and descending (6 / 6) interneurons, key components of the spinal central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator,</b> fired repetitive trains of action potentials during current injection. Neurons that were not part of the central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> did not demonstrate this preponderance for repetitive firing. Analysis of the interspike intervals during current injection revealed that the majority of central <b>pattern</b> <b>generators,</b> descending and commissural interneurons, could readily fire at frequencies up to twice that of swimming. We suggest that Xenopus neurons can be considered as conditional oscillators: in the presence of unpatterned excitation they exhibit an ability to fire rhythmically. This property makes the Xenopus embryonic central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> more similar to other model central <b>pattern</b> <b>generators</b> than has hitherto been appreciated...|$|R

The main purpose of a digital <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> is to stimulate the inputs of a digital electronic device.
