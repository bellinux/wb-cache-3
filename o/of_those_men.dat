5|$|From Campobello, Eddy sailed up the Saint John River to Maugerville, where 27 {{men were}} recruited, {{and then up}} to the Maliseet {{settlement}} at Aukpaque (just upriver from present-day Fredericton). There he learned the bad news that Pierre Tomah, the main Maliseet chief, {{was not interested in}} taking up the hatchet. Eddy was able to convince Ambroise St. Aubin, one of Tomah's competitors, and 15 men to join the expedition in exchange for an agreement with the Maugerville community to support the families <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men.</b> In another disappointment, none of the local Acadians joined, contrary to assertions St. Aubin had made to Eddy during a previous visit to the area.|$|E
5|$|Elliott {{embarked}} for Australia on the RMS Orontes on 15 May 1919, {{sharing a}} cabin {{with an old}} friend, Brigadier General Gordon Bennett. They arrived back in Melbourne on 28 June, and his AIF appointment was terminated the following day. He contested the federal election {{as a candidate for}} the Nationalist Party of Australia on 13 December 1919. He achieved the greatest popular vote of any Victorian candidate for the Senate. Moreover, he repeated this success at the 1925 election. Although not naturally suited to life in the federal parliament, he made significant contributions, and was outspoken in his efforts to assist returned servicemen, particularly those with whom he had served. This outspokenness often took the form of arguing in the Senate in relation to the new legislation being brought before it, when such legislation involved the defence forces. At other times, he would personally champion the cause <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> who had been in his battalion.|$|E

25|$|Having mobilized some 33,000 Estonians as the Soviets were {{evacuating}} in {{the summer}} of 1941, no more than half <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> were used for military service; the rest perished in Gulag concentration camps and labour battalions, mainly in the early months of the war.|$|E
25|$|With {{the loss}} <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men,</b> the {{garrison}} at Houston's Station was seriously beleaguered.

With the garrison joining his force, Sevier marched to the Little Tennessee and burned Chilhowee.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, {{there was}} a U.S. Navy base {{on the north side}} of Morro Rock where sailors were trained to operate LCVPs. The {{breakwater}} on the southwest side of the Rock was built in 1944-45 to protect the LCVPs entering and leaving the harbor. Soldiers from Camp San Luis Obispo would come to Morro Bay and practice loading into the LCVPs. Many <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> were at Normandy on D-Day.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} medal, the {{next-of-kin}} <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> {{and women who}} lost their lives as a result of enemy action, were presented with a memorial plaque and memorial scroll, both inscribed with the deceased's full name, and a condolence slip signed by King George V. More than a million plaques were produced to commemorate the sacrifice of military and mercantile marine men and women who fell between 4 August 1914 and 30 April 1920.|$|E

25|$|So far, {{attempts}} to firmly link the legendary Ragnar {{with one or}} several <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> have failed {{because of the difficulty}} in reconciling the various accounts and their chronology. Nonetheless, the core tradition of a Viking hero named Ragnar (or similar) who wreaked havoc in mid-ninth-century Europe and who fathered many famous sons is remarkably persistent, and some aspects of it are covered by relatively reliable sources, such as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.|$|E
25|$|Orchard named {{at least}} five WFM men as his accomplices in the crimes to which he confessed. Three <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> stood trial in five court cases, four trials in Idaho and one in Colorado.

25|$|The vestry {{was added}} in 1880, with the screens {{and a new}} altar, {{as well as new}} {{decoration}} to the ceilings of the chancel and sanctuary, being completed in 1890 to designs by J D Sedding. In 1921, a rood was added atop the chancel screen in memory <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> of the parish who had lost their lives in the First World War.

25|$|Three centuries pass, {{during which}} the first Men appear in Beleriand. These are the Edain, {{descendants}} <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>Men</b> who have rebelled against the rule of Morgoth's servants and journeyed westward. Most of the Elves welcome them, and they are given fiefs throughout Beleriand. The House of Bëor rules over the land of Ladros, the Folk of Haleth retreat to the forest of Brethil, and the lordship of Dor-lómin is granted to the House of Hador. Later, other Men enter Beleriand, the Easterlings, {{many of whom are}} in secret league with Morgoth.|$|E
25|$|During this {{transition}} period and beyond, various groups of former Kuroda bushi held sporadic meetings and training sessions {{in memory of}} the now bygone era. The old bushi present at these sessions included Uchida Ryogoro, Shiraishi Hanjiro and many of the former Dangyo (instructors) of the Kuroda clan. Due to newfound cooperation between the surviving SMR-lineages there were several joint-licenses of the Haruyoshi and Jigyo-branches of SMR issued in the late 19th century. Shiraishi Hanjiro was one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> who received a full Menkyo Kaiden license. By the end of the Meiji era, (1912), only Shiraishi was still active as a fully qualified exponent and dedicated teacher of the last two remaining Kuroda Jō lineages.|$|E
25|$|When {{morning was}} come {{they set up}} an eagle at the eastern gate, and {{erecting}} an altar of victory they celebrated appropriate rites with all due solemnity, according to their ancestral superstition: to the one whom they venerate as their god of Victory they give the name of Mars, and the bodily characteristics of Hercules, imitating his physical proportion by means of wooden columns, and {{in the hierarchy of}} their gods he is the Sun, or as the Greeks call him, Apollo. From this fact the opinion <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> appears somewhat probable who hold that the Saxons were descended from the Greeks, because the Greeks call Mars Hirmin or Hermes, a word which we use even to this day, either for blame or praise, without knowing its meaning.|$|E

25|$|With {{help from}} the local Jewish community, which was forced to support the camp inmates, her team sent {{supplies}} of food, medicines, clothes and also money, first to Lobor-Grad and later to another camp at Gornja Rijeka, both situated north of Zagreb. Her team also helped {{the members of the}} Croatian Red Cross at the main railway station in Zagreb, providing travel supplies for workers in trains that stopped there on their way to forced labor in Germany - some <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men,</b> women and children returned to Zagreb after they were stopped in Maribor and Linz and were not allowed to travel further due to their illness - they were taken care by the Red Cross and the Action. During that work, in March 1942, Budisavljević met the head nurse, Dragica Habazin, who became a close collaborator in the following months and years in helping the inmates from various camps that were relocated to Zagreb and other places.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact Estonia was illegally annexed by the Soviet Union on 6 August 1940 and renamed the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1941, some 34,000 Estonians were drafted into the Red Army, of whom less than 30% survived the war. No more than half <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> were used for military service. The rest perished in Gulag concentration camps and labour battalions, mainly {{in the early months}} of the war. After {{it became clear that the}} German invasion of Estonia would be successful, political prisoners who could not be evacuated were executed by the NKVD, so that they would not be able to make contact with the Nazi government. More than 300,000 citizens of Estonia, almost a third of the population at the time, were affected by deportations, arrests, execution and other acts of repression. As a result of the Soviet takeover, Estonia permanently lost at least 200,000 people or 20% of its population to repression, exodus and war.|$|E
25|$|The 224th {{commanded}} by Lieutenant-Colonel D.H. Thompson {{was divided into}} groups for the landings. The commanding officer and sixty-five men who were to establish the Main Dressing Station (MDS) travelled in the same aircraft as brigade headquarters, while Nos 1, 2 and 3 Sections were attached to the 1st Canadian, 8th and 9th parachute battalions. Arriving in Normandy from around 01:00, many of the unit landed {{too far to the}} east in the flooded marshes beside the River Dives. One <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> was the commanding officer who then spent three weeks trying to rejoin the unit from behind German lines before being captured. The members of the 224th who landed on the correct drop zone proceeded to set up their Main Dressing Station in a farm at Le Mesnil. By noon, around two thirds of the 22nd were still missing, but the MDS had managed to treat fifty-five wounded and conduct ten surgical operations.|$|E
