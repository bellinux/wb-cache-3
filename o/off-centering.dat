50|$|In {{order for}} the {{coexistence}} of magnetism and ferroelectricity (multiferroic), one possible mechanism is lone-pair driven where the A-site drives the displacement and partially filled “d” shell on the B-site contributes to the magnetism. Examples include BiFeO3, BiMnO3, PbVO3. In the above materials, the A-site cation (Bi3+, Pb2+) has a stereochemically active 6s2 lone-pair which causes the Bi 6p (empty) orbital to come closer in energy to the O 2p orbitals. This leads to hybridization between the Bi 6p and O 2p orbitals and drives the <b>off-centering</b> of the cation towards the neighboring anion resulting in ferroelectricity. In BiFeO3, for example, <b>off-centering</b> of ions gives rise to an electric polarization, while at a lower temperature additional magnetic ordering breaks time-reversal symmetry.|$|E
50|$|The {{relative}} ion size {{requirements for}} {{stability of the}} cubic structure are quite stringent, so slight buckling and distortion can produce several lower-symmetry distorted versions, in which the coordination numbers of A cations, B cations or both are reduced. Tilting of the BO6 octahedra reduces the coordination of an undersized A cation from 12 to as low as 8. Conversely, <b>off-centering</b> of an undersized B cation within its octahedron allows it to attain a stable bonding pattern. The resulting electric dipole {{is responsible for the}} property of ferroelectricity and shown by perovskites such as BaTiO3 that distort in this fashion.|$|E
50|$|In {{improper}} geometric ferroelectrics {{a structural}} phase transition at high temperatures causes {{the appearance of}} ferroelectricity. A prototypical compound is the family of hexagonal rare earth manganites (h-RMnO3 with R=Ho-Lu, Y), showing a structural phase transition at around 1300 K providing the necessary symmetry lowering by tilting of the MnO5 bipyramids. This allows for an electrostatically driven corrugation of the R-ion layers. The value of the induced polarization of several µC/cm² is {{comparable to that of}} usual displacive ferroelectrics.The multiferroic phase is entered only at cryogenic temperatures when antiferromagnetic order due to spin frustration arises. Thus only weak, indirect coupling between two disparate order parameters can occur.The exact microscopic mechanism of the ferroelectric ordering in hexagonal RMnO3 is still questionable in the scientific community, i.e. it is still matter of debate whether only the corrugation of R-ions is the origin of the electric polarization or whether an <b>off-centering</b> of Mn ions also contributes to the polarization.|$|E

However, the extent of excitation is much less than before. At a far <b>off-center</b> dopant location, the dot-impurity overlap gets highly quenched so that the γ oscillation has little impact {{in comparison to the}} near <b>off-center</b> location. Even in the low η regime, where one usually expects the γ oscillation to be significant, we confront a nominal influence of the same, owing to such a depleted dot-impurity overlap. Thus, although we envisage the maximization because of the same reason as given earlier, its intensity is significantly reduced.|$|R

METHODS: For this purpose, anthropomorphic phantoms representing adult male, female and overweight male were scanned on 192 -slice CT scanner at eleven different vertical positions (maximal <b>off-centering</b> ± 5 cm). Monte Carlo simulations were performed for each of the investigated setup, using tube current values extracted from the raw data, in order to obtain 3 D dose distributions. Organ doses were calculated as a function of vertical <b>off-centering</b> and compared with the reference values, calculated for the phantoms positioned in the gantry isocenter. Image noise was also calculated as a function of phantoms vertical position using few circular regions of interest. Pearson statistical analysis was used to determine the correlation coefficient between image noise and organ dose values with vertical <b>off-centering.</b> RESULTS: Results of our study showed a significant difference in tube currents applied by the CT scanner when the phantom was scanned in off-centered vertical positions compared to those obtained when the phantom was positioned in the gantry isocenter (p< 0. 005). For all investigated phantom configurations the vertical <b>off-centering</b> below 20 mm in both directions resulted in relative organ dose differences below 7...|$|E
40|$|Using first-principles density {{functional}} theory we {{predict a}} ferroelectric ground state [...] driven by <b>off-centering</b> {{of the magnetic}} Mn^ 4 + ion [...] in perovskite-structure BaMnO_ 3. Our finding is surprising, since the competition between energy-lowering covalent bond formation, and energy-raising Coulombic repulsions usually only favors <b>off-centering</b> on the perovskite B-site for non-magnetic d^ 0 ions. We explain this tendency for ferroelectric <b>off-centering</b> by analyzing the changes in electronic structure between the centrosymmetric and polar states, and by calculating the Born effective charges; we find anomalously large values for Mn and O consistent with our calculated polarization of 12. 8 μC/cm^ 2.

One cell within each array was then injected with the biotinylated tracer Neurobiotin to determine which of the cells were coupled via gap junctions. Cross-correlation analyses indicated that neighboring <b>off-center</b> �-GCs maintain short-latency (� 2. 5 msec) synchronous spiking, whereas the spontaneous spike activities of on-center �-GC neighbors are not correlated. Without exception, those <b>off-center</b> �-GCs showing synchronous spiking {{were found to be}} tracer coupled to both amacrine cells and neighboring <b>off-center</b> �-GCs.

Using micropatterned substrates to impose reproducible cell–cell interactions, we show that {{in the absence of}} other polarizing cues, cell–cell contacts are the main regulator of nucleus and centrosome positioning, and intracellular polarized organization. In a variety of cell types, including astrocytes, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells, calcium-dependent cadherin-mediated cell–cell interactions induce nucleus and centrosome <b>off-centering</b> toward cell–cell contacts, and promote orientation of the nucleus–centrosome axis toward free cell edges. Nucleus and centrosome <b>off-centering</b> is controlled by N-cadherin through the regulation of cell interactions with the extracellular matrix, whereas the orientation of the nucleus–centrosome axis is determined by the geometry of N-cadherin–mediated contacts.

Ca <b>off-centering</b> was found to {{play a critical role}} in stabilizing the ferroelectric phase and tuning the polarization states in both systems. It was demonstrated that the atomic displacement due to Ca <b>off-centering</b> in the bulky Ba-site in the perovskite structure provides an effective approach to compensate the reduction of ferroelectricity due to the chemical pressure, which allows to keep the Curie point nearly constant in the (Ba 1 -xCax) TiO 3 system and increase the Curie point in the (Ba 1 -xCax) (Ti 0. 9 Zr 0. 1) O 3 system. It was commonly observed that the Ca <b>off-centering</b> effects lead to the shift of the R-O and O-T phase transitions toward lower temperatures and the ferroelectric stability of the T-phase, resulting in the occurrence of quantum phase transitions with interesting physics phenomena at low temperatures in the (Ba 1 -xCax) TiO 3 system and the great enhancement of electromechanical coupling effects around room temperature in the (Ba 1 -xCax) (Ti 0. 9 Zr 0. 1) O 3 system over a wide composition range of the Ca-concentration.
