2500|$|The {{binomial}} name of {{the species}} {{as a whole is}} <b>Ovis</b> <b>ammon,</b> described by Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758, and all members of the species are commonly called [...] "argali". The Marco Polo subspecies <b>Ovis</b> <b>ammon</b> polii was first described scientifically by zoologist Edward Blyth in 1841. [...] These sheep are also commonly called [...] "Marco Polo's Argali" [...] or the [...] "Pamir Argali.".|$|R

50|$|The fauna {{recorded}} in the village consist of ibex (Capra (genus), duck, red-striped fox, snow leopard (Panthera uncia syn. Uncia uncia), markhor (Capra falconeri) (wild goat), Marco Polo sheep (<b>Ovis</b> <b>ammon</b> polii), and yak (Bos grunniens and Bos mutus).|$|R
50|$|The fauna is {{very rich}} and {{consists}} of Persian leopards (Panthera pardus ciscaucasica), Indian wolves (Canis lupus pallipes), wild boars (Sus scrofa), maral deer (Cervus elaphus maral), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), urial (<b>Ovis</b> <b>ammon</b> arkali), wild goats (Capra aegagrus) and goitered gazelles (Gazella subgutturosa).|$|R
50|$|All are parasites of cloven-hoofed mammals - Family Bovidae, {{including}} domestic sheep, domestic cattle, the Mongolian gazelle (Procapra gutturosa), the chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), {{the alpine}} ibex (Capra ibex), the yak (Bos grunniens), plus doubtful records on the argali (<b>Ovis</b> <b>ammon),</b> the bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) and the Dall sheep (Ovis dalli).|$|R
50|$|Severtzov {{wrote the}} Vertical and Horizontal Distribution of Turkestan Wildlife (1873), which {{included}} the first description {{of a number of}} animals. Among them is a subspecies of argali (wild sheep) later named after him: <b>Ovis</b> <b>ammon</b> severtzovi. He also described many new species and subspecies of birds. The Spotted Great Rosefinch Carpodacus severtzovi is among those named after him.|$|R
50|$|The primary host of M. ovinus is the {{domestic}} sheep. Also, records on argali (<b>Ovis</b> <b>ammon),</b> bighorn sheep (<b>Ovis</b> canadensis), and Dall sheep (Ovis dalli) are doubted.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} production performances upon slaughter in the hybrids obtained by crossbreeding of the mouflon (<b>Ovis</b> <b>ammon</b> musimon Pal.) and domestic sheep. The morphological and histomorphometric study was carried out on fragments deltoid muscles (Musculus deltoideus) sampled from seven MM x FT hybrids and seven MT x FM hybrids, respectively. To do so, muscle fragments were fixed in a 10 % formalin solution and histological preparations were stained through the Mallory trichromic method. Histomorphometric analysis reveals that the MM x FT hybrids have thicker muscular fibbers and smaller amounts of inter-fibrillar connective tissue than the MT x FM hybrids (p 0. 05). Results of our study show that using mouflon (<b>Ovis</b> <b>ammon</b> musimon Pal.) and local Tigaie sheep in the development of new genotypes could be a good solution for both the conservation of these threatened species and production of high quality mutton...|$|R

40|$|Complete {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) control regions (CR) were sequenced and analysed {{in order}} to investigate wild sheep taxonomy and the origin of domestic sheep (Ovis aries). The dataset for phylogenetic analyses includes 63 unique CR sequences from wild sheep of the mouflon (O. musimon, O. orientalis), urial (O. vignei), argali (O. ammon) and bighorn (O. canadensis) groups, and from domestic sheep of Asia, Europe and New Zealand. Domestic sheep occurred in two clearly separated branches with mouflon (O. musimon) mixed {{into one of the}} domestic sheep clusters. Genetic distances and molecular datings based on O. canadensis CR and mtDNA protein-coding sequences provide strong evidence for domestications from two mouflon subspecies. Other wild sheep sequences are in two additional well-separated branches. <b>Ovis</b> <b>ammon</b> collium and O. ammon nigrimontana are joined with a specimen from the transkaspian Ust-Urt plateau currently named O. vignei arkal. <b>Ovis</b> <b>ammon</b> ammon, O. ammon darwini and O. vignei bochariensis represent a separate clade and the earliest divergence from the mouflon group. Therefore, O. musimon, O. vignei bochariensis and Ust-Urt sheep are not members of a 'moufloniform' or O. orientalis species, but belong to different clades. Furthermore, Ust-Urt sheep could be a hybrid population or an O. ammon subspecies closely related to O. ammon nigrimontana. Stefan Hiendleder, Bernhard Kaupe, Rudolf Wassmuth, Axel Jank...|$|R

Mongolian wild ass (Equus hemionus hemionus), goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa), Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes) are the common ungulate and carnivorous species here. A recent survey showed there were 3128 to 4711 wild asses and 11366 to 16235 goitered gazelles living in Kalamaili. Argali sheep (<b>Ovis</b> <b>ammon)</b> and Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) are also reported but very rare.|$|R
2500|$|The Marco Polo sheep (<b>Ovis</b> <b>ammon</b> polii) is a {{subspecies}} of argali sheep, {{named after}} Marco Polo. Their habitat is the mountainous regions of Central Asia.

[...] However, a {{comparison of}} the mitochondrial DNA control region (CR) found that two subspecies of urial, Ovis vignei (or orientalis) arkal and O. v./o. bochariensis, grouped with two different clades of argali (<b>Ovis</b> <b>ammon).</b>|$|R

50|$|Erysimum {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species {{including}} the Garden Carpet (Xanthorhoe fluctuata). In addition, some species of weevils, like Ceutorhynchus chlorophanus, live inside the fruits feeding on the developing seeds. Many species of beetles, bugs and grasshoppers eat on the leaves and stalks. Some mammalian herbivores, for example Mule Deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in North America, Argali (<b>Ovis</b> <b>ammon)</b> in Mongolia, Red Deer (Cervus elaphus) in Central Europe, or Spanish Ibex (Capra pyrenaica) in the Iberian Peninsula, feed on wallflower flowering and fruiting stalks.|$|R

Predators include snow leopards (Panthera uncia or Uncia uncia), Tibetan wolves (Canis lupus chanco), Turkestan lynx (Lynx lynx isabellinus) and Tibetan blue bears (Ursus arctos pruinosus). At the bottom end of the food chain are large numbers of pika (Ochotona spp.).|$|R
