5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. Mercedes conducted race simulations {{to see how the}} cars would behave with a heavy fuel load. Rosberg was fastest in the first practice session with a lap time of one minute and 35.461 seconds, ahead of teammate Hamilton in second. Alonso was third-fastest, ahead of Bottas and Kimi Räikkönen. Magnussen, Ricciardo, Button and Daniil Kvyat rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Verstappen's run ended early when he pulled <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the track at the S curves with smoke billowing from his engine because of a broken exhaust valve, and Merhi spun at turn 13 (causing Bottas to swerve to avoid him).|$|E
5|$|Further down, Ralf Schumacher took Zonta for {{eleventh}} {{place and}} Diniz passed teammate Salo for 14th position. Barrichello caught de la Rosa by lap twelve and passed {{him to take}} fourth and started to come under pressure from Frentzen. Herbert pulled <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the track with gearbox problems on lap 13. Barrichello passed Trulli for third position at the second corner two laps later. Barrichello became the first driver to make a pit stop by coming in on lap 17. Frentzen made his pit stop one lap later and re-joined in sixth place. By lap 20, Häkkinen had a lead of 1.4 seconds over Coulthard, who in turn was almost 22 seconds ahead of Trulli. de la Rosa was a further 2.1 seconds behind Trulli, and was being caught by Barrichello in fifth who set a new fastest lap, a 1:44.300. Villeneuve overtook Irvine to claim eighth place on lap 22.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Alonso set the fastest lap {{of the day}} with a time of 1:39.283; Red Bull drivers Vettel and Webber finished with the second and third-fastest times. Rosberg was fourth, ahead of Hamilton and Kubica. Massa, Adrian Sutil, Button and Barrichello followed in the top-ten. Massa caused the session to be disrupted after spinning in the fourth corner and narrowly avoided making contact with the barrier. The session was red-flagged to allow Massa's car to be removed from the centre of the track to be taken to the pit lane. Timo Glock's lost the use of his car's fifth gear and pulled <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the track at turn twelve which prematurely ended his running. Vitaly Petrov spun at the exit of turn 14 and reversed his car to rejoin the circuit, avoiding the need for a red-flag. Vettel was the fastest driver in the final practice session with a lap of 1:38.052; Webber was third-fastest. Kubica separated the two Red Bull drivers in second, with Sutil fourth. Alonso was fifth-fastest, and Barrichello was sixth. Vitantonio Liuzzi, Massa, Button and Hamilton rounded out the top ten.|$|E

The lead guard will pressure {{the ball in the}} backcourt, and also can shade <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> and form a 2-man trap with a defensive player in the 3-set when an offensive guard tries <b>to</b> bring up <b>the</b> ball down the sideline.|$|R

5|$|On lap17, Massa and Hamilton {{were given}} drive-through penalties, Massa for colliding with Hamilton and Hamilton for forcing Räikkönen {{off the track}} into turn one. Hamilton took his penalty immediately. Massa made a pit stop for fuel and tyres on the next lap, before coming into the pit lane again on lap 20 to serve his penalty, which dropped him to 14th place, one place ahead of Hamilton. Meanwhile, Kubica and Räikkönen made pit stops on lap17 for tyres and fuel. On the same lap, Kovalainen pulled <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the track with engine {{problems}} and retired from the race. Alonso made a pit stop on lap18, emerging ahead of Kubica to take the provisional lead, with cars in front still to pit. Trulli, Vettel and Bourdais made pit stops over the following six laps. Fisichella retired from the race with gearbox problems on lap21. Piquet took his first pit stop on lap28, emerging ahead of Bourdais as Alonso opened the gap on Kubica to 7.8seconds. Massa overtook Button to take 12th position one lap later.|$|E
5|$|On the 77th lap, Power and {{teammate}} Castroneves (on the Primary tires) encountered slower cars, and {{the latter}} {{took advantage of the}} situation which allowed him to overtake Power for the lead. Castroneves began to pull away from Power. Ten laps later, de Silvestro's car ran out of fuel and pulled <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the track onto the infield grass to retire from the race which prompted the fourth (and final) caution. Racing resumed when the pace car drove into the pit lane at the start of lap 92. Power went onto the outside lane at the entrance of the first turn, and Castroneves drove left as a blocking manoeuvre. Castroneves accelerated out of the corner's exit which caused Power to run wide. Dixon took advantage of the situation and passed Power around the outside to take over second place. The move was immediately reviewed by the IndyCar chief steward and competition president Brian Barnhart, which led to Castroneves being shown a black-flag one minute later as he was deemed as having blocked Power. Castroneves was informed that he was issued with a drive-through penalty. He opted to remain on the track for the final two laps and crossed the start-finish line first on the road.|$|E
5|$|While Räikkönen {{closed on}} Verstappen at the front, Fernando Alonso's home race ended on lap 47, pulling <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the track at turn three. Räikkönen {{managed to get}} into the one-second window to {{activate}} the drag reduction system (DRS), as Vettel was eight seconds behind him with Ricciardo closing on him in fourth place. By lap 57, Ricciardo was close enough to use DRS as well, but unable to pass. Three laps later, Ricciardo made an attempt at overtaking into turn one, but braking too late left him running wide, allowing Vettel back through. As the front runners lapped backmarkers, Kvyat, after scoring the first fastest lap for himself and Toro Rosso, overtook Gutiérrez for tenth place. Two laps from finish, Ricciardo suffered a puncture and was forced to pit, but retained fourth place ahead of Bottas. On the last lap, Renault drivers Kevin Magnussen and Jolyon Palmer collided, but both made it to the finish. As Verstappen crossed the finish line, he became the youngest ever and first Dutch race winner in Formula One.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{this and}} because the waist is often synonymous with the stomach, one can become {{confused}} as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exact location of the waist. Another confusing factor is that the waistline differs on different people. <b>To</b> locate <b>the</b> natural waistline, one need simply stand upright and then tilt <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> keeping <b>the</b> legs and hips straight.

5|$|Another {{round of}} green flag pit stops {{commenced}} after {{three hours and}} eight minutes with Tréluyer being {{the first of the}} leaders to stop with both Toyota cars following two minutes later. The safety car was deployed when Nakajima's right-front tyre failed on the Wellington straight following contact with a LMGTE car and debris from his Toyota was littered on the track. Nakajima pulled <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the circuit at Brooklands corner and stopped. Marshals were required to remove the debris from the track. The safety car drove into the pit lane 12 minutes later and racing resumed with Tréluyer remaining in first and Lieb second. Nakajima's car was transported back into his garage for repairs. Dumas turned into Franchitti's Ford and half-spun into the grass at Club corner, losing more than ten seconds to Tréluyer. Dumas was forced wide into the Woodcote corner run-off area by Rao and Rees overtook Franchitti for fifth in LMGTE Pro. After serving an earlier three-minute stop-and-go penalty for changing the car's engine Calado was running in third place in LMGTE Pro while Buemi drove the No. 5 Toyota back onto the circuit after his car was repaired. Tréluyer made a pit stop for fuel and tyres with Fässler taking over the No. 7 car. Fässler was followed by Lieb making a pit stop from the lead and handed driving duties to Jani. Fässler thus retook the lead with a nine-second advantage.|$|E
5|$|Montoya {{made his}} pit stop on lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant he pulled {{to the side of the}} main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant he pulled to the side of the circuit. Panis made his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the 32nd lap.|$|E
5|$|When {{the race}} {{restarted}} on lap twelve, Michael Schumacher led, while Häkkinen and Villeneuve were running second and third. Behind them were Ralf Schumacher, Fisichella, Wurz, Gene, Heidfeld, Zonta, Mazzacane, Diniz, Salo and Alesi. Michael Schumacher began to immediately {{pull away from}} Häkkinen as he set consecutive fastest laps. Further down the field, Wurz overtook Diniz and Mazzacane for tenth position. By the start of lap 13, Michael Schumacher led Häkkinen by 2.1 seconds. Further back, Zonta passed Heidfeld to take ninth. On lap 14, Zonta moved up into seventh position after passing Gené and Wurz. Villeneuve became the third retirement of the race when he pulled <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the track with gearbox problems on the same lap. Meanwhile, Verstappen overtook Fisichella to take fourth position. Heidfeld retired after his engine failed and spun off at Variante della Roggia chicane on lap 15. One lap later, Ralf Schumacher lost two positions after being passed by Verstappen and Zonta. Salo passed Mazzacane to claim ninth position on lap 17. At {{the start of the}} 19th lap, Zonta tried to pass Verstappen heading into the Variante Goodyear chicane, but Verstappen moved onto an early defensive line to prevent Zonta from moving ahead. Zonta attempted to overtake Verstappen into the Variante della Rogia chicane to take third place four laps later, but was unable to complete it as he ran wide. He managed to get ahead after exiting the chicane on the same lap.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning on Wednesday, January 23, 1991, at {{approximately}} 1:20a.m., Lunsford spotted a suspicious vehicle travelling along U.S. Highway 59, a white 1981 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme with Maine license plates. Lunsford pulled the vehicle <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the road and turned on his dashboard camera to record the traffic stop. He then got out of his cruiser and approached the vehicle. Inside the vehicle were three men, Baldemar Sambrano Villarreal, his younger half brother, Reynaldo Sambrano Villarreal, and their accomplice, Jesus Cortez Zambrano. Lunsford questioned the driver, Reynaldo Villarreal, and asked whether he had any ID on him, to which Villarreal replied no. He claimed that he had a driver's license but did not have it on him. He also said that he was helping his brother, Baldemar, drive the car. Unbeknownst to Lunsford, the three men had loaded the car with 31 pounds of marijuana, and were driving from Houston, Texas, to Chicago, Illinois, where they planned to sell it all. At 1:27a.m., Lunsford asked to look in the trunk of the vehicle and the men reluctantly agreed. Lunsford and Reynaldo opened the trunk and Lunsford could immediately smell the scent of marijuana.|$|E

25|$|Massa at {{this point}} was twelve seconds in arrears and Hamilton was granted {{permission}} by Bonnington to attack earlier than planned. Rosberg's front brake temperatures went beyond their optimum operating window and {{in his attempt to}} conserve his rear tyre life by moving his brake bias towards the front of his car, he compromised his brakes as a result. Hamilton used DRS and as Rosberg applied his brakes, he drove straight into the Rettifilo chicane's run-off area, slalomed his way through the obstacles, enabling Hamilton to gain the lead. Alonso's energy recovery system failed which triggered a complete electrical shutdown half a minute later and pulled <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the track, and into Rettifilo's run-off area to retire {{for the first time in}} the season. Button feigned an overtaking attempt at Pérez driving into the Rettifilo chicane but was unable to get ahead and both drivers narrowly avoided contact. Bottas made an passing attempt on Magnussen entering the same turn but Magnussen drove defensively, forcing Bottas to cut the chicane on lap 32. On the 33rd lap, Ricciardo overtook Räikkönen for ninth by going around the inside of the latter entering the Rettifilo chicane and braked later than he did.|$|E
25|$|Räikkönen was {{the first}} driver to make a pit stop on lap 20 and rejoined in tenth place. The McLaren and Ferrari teams were {{employing}} different strategies – the McLaren team were planning a two-stop strategy whereas the Ferrari team were planning to make pit stop. Häkkinen made his pit stop from the lead on the following lap and came out behind Montoya. Heideld also had a pit stop on the same lap, coming out in tenth position. Montoya took over {{the lead of the}} race for four laps before taking his pit stop on lap 25 having been placed under pressure by Häkkinen who moved back into first place. Montoya re-emerged in fourth position, behind the duel between Barrichello and Ralf Schumacher for position. With a clear road ahead of him, Häkkinen increased his lead to ten seconds over Michael Schumacher by lap 27 as he set two consecutive fastest laps. Further back, Montoya was being held up by team-mate Ralf Schumacher and Barrichello. Seven laps later, the Williams team showed Ralf Schumacher a switch sign on his pit board, asking him to let Montoya through. Ralf Schumacher did not let Montoya past as he felt he was driving quickly to be able to overtake Barrichello but was unable to pass the Brazilian driver. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on the 35th lap, allowing Montoya to battle Barrichello for third place. His pit stop took longer than usual as his mechanics had difficulties removing the refuelling nozzle from his car. Ralf Schumacher pulled <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the circuit two laps later when his engine cut out, forcing him to retire.|$|E
500|$|At the restart, Michael Schumacher and Trulli again {{held their}} {{positions}}, whilst Ralf Schumacher {{made the best}} start in the field moving from 9th to 6th place {{by the end of}} the first lap.

At the conclusion of the first lap, the order was Michael Schumacher, Trulli, Coulthard, Frentzen, Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Alesi, Barrichello, Fisichella, Herbert, Irvine, Salo, Verstappen, Diniz, Villeneuve, Zonta, Mazzacane, Wurz, Button, Gené and Heidfeld. Michael Schumacher began to immediately pull clear from Trulli as he began setting consecutive fastest laps. Häkkinen started to challenge Frentzen for second position on lap two. By the eleventh lap, Michael Schumacher had built up his lead to Trulli over eleven seconds as Wurz performed the race's first overtake when he passed Mazzacane for 17th position. Button pulled <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the track with engine problems and retired on lap 16.
