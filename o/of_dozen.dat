The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed). Those four vary in tensile strength {{as a function of}} oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of volcanic plumes at Pele and Loki in 1979 provided conclusive evidence that Io was geologically active. Generally, plumes form when volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide are ejected skyward from Io's volcanoes at speeds reaching , creating umbrella-shaped clouds {{of gas and}} dust. Additional materials that might {{be found in the}} volcanic plumes include sodium, potassium, and chlorine. Although striking in appearance, volcanic plumes are relatively uncommon. Of the 150 or so active volcanoes observed on Io, plumes have only been observed at a couple <b>of</b> <b>dozen</b> of them. The limited area of Io's lava flows suggests that much of the resurfacing needed to erase Io's cratering record must come from plume deposits.|$|E

25|$|In 1916, the Original American Kazoo Company in Eden, New York started {{manufacturing}} kazoos for {{the masses}} in a two-room shop and factory, utilizing a couple <b>of</b> <b>dozen</b> jack presses for cutting, bending and crimping metal sheets. These machines were used for many decades. By 1994, the company produced 1.5 million kazoos per year and was the only manufacturer of metal kazoos in North America.

25|$|After CR43, NY166 begins winding northward through Middlefield, {{passing a}} large pond {{on the east}} side of the highway. The route soon intersects with CR52, where it bends to the {{northeast}} once again, passing Forest <b>of</b> <b>Dozen</b> Dads County Park before entering the hamlet of Five Points. Five Points consists of a few farms, but NY166 continues northeastward out of the hamlet through Middlefield, passing several farms and residences. The route and the shrinking Susquehanna bend northward, where NY166 enters the town of Roseboom, where it intersects with the western terminus of NY165. After NY165, NY166 passes the Roseboom Cemetery and leaves the hamlet northward. A short distance later, CR33, which intersected back near Milford, terminates now in Cherry Valley. After this intersection, residences become more dense, as NY166 enters the village of Cherry Village, where it intersects with CR54 (Genesee Street). At that intersection, NY166 turns east onto Genesee Street. The route turns northward onto Main Street at an intersection with CR50 (Lancaster Street) before leaving the village after CR54 forks off once again on Main Street.|$|E

500|$|The same year, {{the comedian}} lent {{his name and}} writing talents to Dan Leno's Comic Journal. The paper was {{primarily}} aimed at young adults and featured a mythologised version of Leno– the first comic paper to take its name from, and base a central character on, a living person. [...] Published by C. Arthur Pearson, Issue No. 1 appeared on 26 February 1898, and the paper sold 350,000 copies a year. Leno wrote most of the paper's comic stories and jokes, and Tom Browne contributed many of the illustrations. The comedian retained editorial control of the paper, deciding which items to omit. The Journal was known for its slogans, including [...] "One Touch of Leno Makes the Whole World Grin" [...] and [...] "Won't wash clothes but will mangle melancholy". [...] The cover always showed a caricature of Leno and his editorial staff at work and play. Inside, the features included [...] "Daniel's Diary", [...] "Moans from the Martyr", two yarns, a couple <b>of</b> <b>dozen</b> cartoons and [...] "Leno's Latest– Fresh Jokes and Wheezes Made on the Premises". After a run of nearly two years the novelty wore off, and Leno lost interest. The paper shut down on 2 December 1899.|$|E

Any star that passes the zenith (overhead) {{is on the}} celestial equator, {{the basis of the}} equatorial coordinate system. Each star has a specific declination, and when they rise or set, they give a bearing for navigation. Stars are learned by compass point, making a star compass (star compasses list ~150 stars, in some systems). A simplified compass might list only a couple <b>of</b> <b>dozen</b> stars. For example, in the Caroline Islands Mau Piailug taught natural navigation using a star compass diagrammed here.

2500|$|A {{number of}} British meetings, {{probably}} {{more than a couple}} <b>of</b> <b>dozen</b> since 1994, have celebrated same-sex relationships through an official meeting for commitment – a public act of worship something very like the traditional Quaker wedding, but without legal significance. British Quakers also supported the 2005 introduction of the legal status of 'civil partnerships' in the UK, and were taken to [...] their 2009 support of same-sex marriage with the idea that [...] "marriage is the Lord’s work and we are but witnesses". In March 2014, same-sex marriages will be formally and legally recognised but the agreements for changes from Civil Partnerships to Marriages are currently on-going as of January 2014. Many Quakers are in support of these changes to British legislation.|$|E

2500|$|An average Jew {{who survived}} in {{occupied}} Poland depended on many acts of assistance and tolerance, wrote Paulsson. [...] "Nearly every Jew that was rescued, was rescued by the cooperative efforts <b>of</b> <b>dozen</b> or more people," [...] as confirmed {{also by the}} Polish-Jewish historian Szymon Datner. Paulsson notes that during the six years of wartime and occupation, the average Jew sheltered by the Poles had three or four sets of false documents and faced recognition as a Jew multiple times. Datner explains also that hiding a Jew lasted often for several years thus increasing the risk involved for each Christian family exponentially. Polish-Jewish writer and Holocaust survivor Hanna Krall has identified 45 Poles who helped to shelter her from the Nazis and Władysław Szpilman, the Polish musician of Jewish origin whose wartime experiences were chronicled in his memoir The Pianist and the film of the same title identified 30 Poles who helped him to survive the Holocaust.|$|E
2500|$|Cricket 28 {{first-class}} cricket matches {{were played}} between 1893 and 1931, including two Tests and 13 Sheffield Shield matches. The first ever Queensland Sheffield Shield {{game was played}} at the ground, with Queensland losing to longtime arch-rivals New South Wales. The Test against England in 1928/29 was the first Test played in Brisbane and was the debut of Don Bradman who scored 18 and 1. The 3rd Test of the series against the West Indian cricket team in 1930/31 was the last first-class fixture at the ground. Brisbane's Exhibition Ground had a short lifespan, staging only two Tests and a couple <b>of</b> <b>dozen</b> first-class matches before being completely replaced by the Gabba. The venue was home to local agricultural shows and when Brisbane was finally granted a Test in 1928–29, it {{was held at the}} Exhibition Ground as it was a natural amphitheatre and could accommodate more people. However, revenue from that match and the Test which followed in 1930–31, was disappointing, largely because of the numbers who got in for free by using their agricultural society badges and the Queensland Cricket Association moved down the road to the Gabba. The venue is no longer used for cricket and instead hosts an average of 300 events each year, including the annual Royal Queensland Show (Ekka) which attracts around 400,000 people.|$|E
2500|$|The Austrians were {{actually}} retreating towards Znaim in Bohemia. The Austrian army had suffered greatly during the Battle of Wagram {{and had to}} leave behind their wounded, but did make off with thousands of French prisoners, a couple <b>of</b> <b>dozen</b> guns and a few eagles. Making good use of night marches, Archduke Charles had {{the bulk of his}} forces assembled at Korneuburg on 7 July. Charles and his senior commanders had considered various plans to continue the campaign, but in the end, Charles was not positioning his army for a continuation of the campaign. The Austrian commander's view well before the Battle of Wagram had been that Austria's best option was to make peace and, in order to achieve that, the Empire needed to have a large, battle-worthy army, which they could use as leverage during the peace talks. Between 9 and 12 August, the French from Eugène's [...] "Army of Italy" [...] clashed with Archduke John's forces in a series of skirmishes and pushed them back into Hungary, while Masséna caught up with and fought the Austrian rearguard in a several actions, most notable of which was the one at Hollabrunn. By now, Napoleon had largely understood Charles's intentions and manoeuvred against them. Marmont and his small XI Corps was the first to engage the Austrian army at the Battle of Znaim and was momentarily largely outnumbered. His 10,000 men faced some 60,000 massed enemy troops, but, in the typical style of Napoleonic warfare, Marmont decided to attack in order to pin down the enemy. He could reasonably expect to be reinforced soon and at 22:00, Napoleon arrived with reinforcements. The battle raged on the next day, with some bloody fighting going on around Znaim. The Austrians took heavy casualties, some 6,200 men, during the battle and, as time passed, the French force was set to be augmented to some 84,000 men, following the imminent arrival of Davout and Oudinot. Recognising the futility of another battle, Charles decided to ask for an armistice. He did so on his own responsibility, as he did not have permission to do so from Emperor Francis I. Ignoring the advice of his senior commanders – Maréchal Berthier was vocal in advising the continuation of hostilities and destruction of the Austrian Empire – Napoleon accepted. The Armistice of Znaim marked the end of the active phase of the 1809 war between France and Austria.|$|E
