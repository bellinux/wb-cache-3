500|$|Due to Manson's growing {{confidence}} and technical skill, the band decided that her vocals {{did not require}} much treatment; [...] "Shirley was singing so much better, and she was coming up with melodies that were longer and had more range to them...there wasn't any point in doing a lot with it. <b>On</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> 'Nobody Loves You' she sings really low on the verse, almost {{at the bottom of}} her range, and then and the end she's singing three and a half octaves higher, almost in falsetto, as the song turns into a big wall of sound", Vig remarked. Manson's original guide vocals were used in the final mixes of several songs; the vocal on [...] "So Like a Rose" [...] was recorded on the first take. On some songs, however, Manson's vocal was subject to Pro Tools plug-ins and post effects. [...] "Til the Day Die" [...] featured a digital [...] "scratch"-effect, created by printing her vocal to DAT and using whatever edited passes sounded good. On [...] "Can't Cry These Tears", the four vocal parts were triple-tracked using different mikes, while a guitar riff was matched to her voice for a section of [...] "Breaking Up the Girl". On [...] "Cherry Lips", her entire vocal was sped up and heavily EQ'd. On slower songs such as [...] "Drive You Home", Garbage were not overly concerned with phrasing and pitch, giving it [...] "a rawer quality". Manson improved on her guitar skills and played more guitar in the studio and live on stage for the eventual tour.|$|E

He [...] {{sits and}} listens and I read books, because I know {{perfectly}} well that, don't take offense, that 90 percent of what I hear on television is supposition, when we're talking about the news. And he's not, not as understanding of my pettiness about that. But why should we hear about body bags and deaths, and how many, what day it's gonna happen, and how many this or that or what do you suppose? Or, I mean, it's not relevant. So, why should I waste my beautiful mind <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that, and watch him suffer.|$|E

60|$|In {{alluding}} to Eunice, she had blundered, strangely enough, <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> the truth. But {{when she spoke}} of herself, the headlong malignity of her suspicions--making every allowance for the anger that had hurried her into them--seemed to call for some little protest against a false assertion.

After a bit I began to grow anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy's system must have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the reverse}} is the case. The gods behave fairly well in Book XXIV. of the Iliad, which, we are to believe, is the latest, or nearly the latest, portion. They are all wroth with the abominable {{behaviour}} of Achilles to dead Hector (XXIV. 134). They console and protect Priam. As for the Odyssey, Mr. Monro finds that in this late Epic the gods are just what Mr. Leaf proclaims them {{to have been in}} his old original kernel. [...] "There is now an Olympian concert that carries <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a moral government of the world. It is very different in the Iliad...."

6000|$|I have {{a letter}} from Baron Von Goethe,[472] which I must have read to me; for though I know German, I have forgot their written hand. I make it a rule seldom to read, and never to answer, foreign letters from {{literary}} folks. It leads to nothing but the battle-dore and shuttle-cock intercourse of compliments, as light as cork and feathers. But Goethe is different, and a wonderful fellow, the Ariosto at once, and almost the Voltaire of Germany. Who could have told me thirty years ago I should correspond, and be <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> an equal footing, with the author of Goetz? Ay, and who could have told me fifty things else that have befallen me?[473] ...|$|E
60|$|She {{had made}} an effort to put <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> {{mourning}} for her son; and nothing could be more touching than this struggle between pious affection and utter poverty--a black ribbon or so, a faded black handkerchief, and one or two more such humble attempts to express by outward signs that grief which passes show. When I looked round upon the storied monuments, the stately hatchments, the cold marble pomp with which grandeur mourned magnificently over departed pride, and turned to this poor widow, bowed down by age and sorrow at the altar of her God, and offering up the prayers and praises of a pious though a broken heart, I felt that this living monument of real grief was worth them all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at present," [...] Nigel said. [...] "We {{are expecting}} the {{reinforcements}} up {{in a few}} days. As you see we have fortified the camp too strongly for Tilly to venture to attack us here. Only yesterday he drew up his army and offered us battle; but the odds were too great, and the king will not fight till his reinforcements arrive. Some of the hotter spirits were sorry {{that he would not}} accept Tilly's invitation, and I own that I rather gnashed my teeth myself; but I knew that the king was right in not risking the whole cause rashly when a few days will put us in a position to meet the Imperialists <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> equal terms. Is there any news, colonel?" [...] he asked, turning to Munro.|$|E

60|$|Down the hill, and {{a little}} way on level ground--houses <b>on</b> one side, <b>something</b> <b>like</b> hedge or {{shrubbery}} on the other--a stop--a gate opened--a hollow sound beneath the carriage, as though crossing a wooden bridge--trees--bright windows--an open door--and light streaming from it.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] said Fulkerson, [...] "you don't {{catch on}} to the {{business}} end of this thing, my friends. You're proceeding <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> the old exploded idea that the demand creates the supply, when everybody knows, if he's watched the course of modern events, that it's just as apt to be the other way. I contend that we've got a real substantial success to celebrate now; but even if we hadn't, the celebration would do more than anything else to create the success, if we got it properly before the public. People will say: Those fellows are not fools; they wouldn't go and rejoice over their magazine unless they had got a big thing in it. And the state of feeling we should produce in the public mind would make a boom of perfectly unprecedented grandeur for E. O. W. Heigh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} to playing Ripton {{on its own}} ground was the crowd. Another {{was the fact that}} one generally got beaten. But your sportsman can put up with defeat. What he does not like is a crowd that regards him as a subtle blend of incompetent idiot and malicious scoundrel, and says so very loud and clear. It was not, of course, the school that did this. They spent their time blushing for the shouters. It was the patriotic inhabitants of Ripton town who made the school wish that they could be saved from their friends. The football ground at Ripton was {{at the edge of the}} school fields, separated from the road by narrow iron railings; and along these railings the choicest spirits of the town would line up, and smoke and yell, and spit and yell again. As Wordsworth wrote, [...] "There are two voices". They were <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> the following lines.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not until}} they were <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> level ground that they could quicken {{the pace of the}} animals. They were not long before they overtook the porters with the litters, and then, as they could do nothing there, they rode on ahead to see that {{everything}} was in readiness for their reception. With the exception of Captain Armstrong none of the party were able to leave their beds next day, but on the following morning Mr. Hawtrey and Mr. Fortescue were both up in time to say good-bye to Lord Halliburn and his friends, who were starting for Martigny. With the girls it was a longer matter. Clara Fortescue was delirious on the morning after their return, and an English doctor staying in the hotel at once pronounced it to be an attack of rheumatic fever; the other two had symptoms of the same malady, but these passed off, and on the fourth day both were able to get up, and on the following day were on sofas in the sitting-room.|$|E

50|$|Also {{so called}} Cave of San Blas, {{it was the}} first Christian temple of Canary Islands, in this place the {{original}} inhabitants of the Canary Islands produced worship to the Virgin of Candelaria.

In this cave a fire was kept <b>on</b> permanently, <b>something</b> <b>like</b> the temple of the Vestal Virgins of ancient Rome.|$|R
60|$|There is in them a {{perfectly}} sincere hope and enthusiasm; {{but it is}} not for us, but for what they might learn from us, if they could rule us as they can rabbits. They cannot tell us anything about heredity, because they do not know anything about it. But they do quite honestly believe that they would know something about it, when they had married and mismarried us for a few hundred years. They cannot tell us who is fit to wield such authority, for they know that nobody is; but they do quite honestly believe that when that authority has been abused for a very long time, somebody somehow will be evolved who is fit for the job. I am no Puritan, and no one who knows my opinions will consider it a mere criminal charge if I say that they are simply gambling. The reckless gambler has no money in his pockets; he has only the ideas in his head. These gamblers have no ideas in their heads; they have only the money in their pockets. But they think that if they could use the money to buy a big society to experiment <b>on,</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> an idea might come to them at last. That is Eugenics.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{odds and}} ends of time," [...] Ezra Jennings went on, [...] "I {{reproduced}} my shorthand notes, in the ordinary form of writing--leaving large spaces between the broken phrases, and even the single words, as they had fallen disconnectedly from Mr. Candy's lips. I then treated the result thus obtained, <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> the principle which one adopts in putting together a child's 'puzzle.' It is all confusion to begin with; {{but it may be}} all brought into order and shape, if you can only find the right way. Acting on this plan, I filled in each blank space on the paper, with what the words or phrases on either side of it suggested to me as the speaker's meaning; altering over and over again, until my additions followed naturally on the spoken words which came before them, and fitted naturally into the spoken words which came after them. The result was, that I not only occupied in this way many vacant and anxious hours, but that I arrived at something which was (as it seemed to me) a confirmation of the theory that I held. In plainer words, after putting the broken sentences together I found the superior faculty of thinking going on, more or less connectedly, in my patient's mind, while the inferior faculty of expression {{was in a state of}} almost complete incapacity and confusion." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{first day}} of {{adventure}} they slept at a hacienda, surrounded with fields where numerous llamas were pasturing. The next began the real mountain work; the rock looked like a wall before them, and the white summits were sharply defined against the blue sky. The sharper air made Rosita shiver; but the English travellers congratulated themselves <b>on</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a breeze, consoling them for the glow with which the sunbeams beat upon the rocks. The palms and huge ferns had given place to pines, and these were growing more scanty. Once or twice they met a brown Indian, robed in a coloured blanket, with a huge straw hat, from beneath which he gazed with curious, though gentle eyes, upon the cavalcade. By-and-by, looking like a string of ants descending a perpendicular wall, Mary beheld a row of black specks slowly moving. She was told that these were the mules bringing down the metal in panniers--the only means of communication, until, as the lieutenant promised, a perpendicular railroad should be invented. The electricity of the atmosphere made jokes easily pass current. The mountain was 'only' one of the spurs of the Andes, a mere infant among the giants; but, had it been set down in Europe, Mont Blanc must have hid his diminished head; and the view was better than {{on some of the}} more enormous neighbours, which were both further inland, and of such height, that to gaze from them was 'like looking from an air-balloon into vacancy.' Whereas here Mary had but to turn her head, as her mule steadily crept round the causeway--a legacy of the Incas--to behold the expanse of the Pacific, a sheet of glittering light in the sunshine, the horizon line raised so high, that the first moment it gave her a sense of there being something wrong with her eye, before the feeling of infinity rushed upon her.|$|E

"What rang {{through this}} scene {{was always the}} sense that these two people had given up <b>on</b> having <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this for {{themselves}} again until they abruptly found it staring them in the face.
