40|$|The rise of {{the mobile}} {{internet}} has rapidly changed the landscape for fielding web surveys. The devices that respondents use to take a web survey vary greatly in size and user interface. This diversity in the interaction between survey and respondent makes it challenging to design a web survey {{for the general public}} and raises various questions for survey researchers. Which strategy should one choose when designing web surveys for the multi-device internet? Should the layout be adapted for the various devices and if so, what effect will this have on survey outcomes and data quality? What is the most user friendly way to present survey questions on mobile devices? This thesis addresses these and other questions on the instrumental (visual) design of web surveys for the multi-device internet.

50|$|The Amritt 2008 R&D Globalization Study {{is based}} on {{responses}} from 204 <b>online</b> <b>respondents</b> from the U.S. and was conducted in April and May 2008. In this survey on R&D globalization, Amritt found that 33% of American companies plan to deploy only 11 to 100 R&D personnel in emerging economies, such as the BRIC countries. Also, a significant number, 16%, said {{that they may have}} over 1,000 people working in R&D in emerging economies. Half of the companies performing R&D in emerging economies do so to serve those local markets, while 42% said that financial pressures played a part. About a quarter of the respondents, 26%, had trouble finding enough talent in their home regions and 17% sought to accelerate time to market by using additional resources in emerging countries. Anecdotal evidence from the survey suggests that time-to-market is likely to become a more significant driver of R&D globalization in the near future.|$|E
5000|$|The {{order not}} to close the schools was granted by the court because the City had not {{complied}} with the recently-amended state law on Mayoral control of the public schools, requiring [...] "meaningful community involvement" [...] {{in the decision to}} close a school.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} why citizens {{perceive a}} tax system as fair or unfair. We review the literature about tax fairness and tax preferences. From this literature, we extract {{the most common}} explanations for tax fairness perception. Most important are the topics of vertical and horizontal fairness, complexity and the discussion between the benefit and the ability-to-pay-principle. Within these topics, we deal also with very current topics like the controversy between capital and labor taxation or the affluence tax. To answer the questions how the tax fairness is perceived in Germany and what criteria are most useful to explain these attitudes, we conduct two surveys. One is a convenience sample, by the help of SoSciPanel a German <b>online</b> <b>respondent</b> pool, {{and the other is}} a student survey. Also, the role of self-interest in these aspects is addressed. Especially we want to shed light on the role of income expectations by the difference between the full population survey and the student survey, since the latter group is more homogenous in actual income. ...|$|R

Two-hundred ninety-nine respondents returned the survey, 21 returning by paper and 278 by electronic form. Response rate to the survey was 90. 3 %. Results showed that, overall, respondents self-rated their overall computer IT skills to be either “average ” or “above average. ” In general, demographics for early and late <b>online</b> <b>respondents</b> tended to be comparable, although late <b>online</b> <b>respondents</b> tended to skew more female than early <b>online</b> <b>respondents.</b> In addition, more early <b>online</b> <b>respondents</b> rated their IT computer skills as average or above average than did late <b>online</b> <b>respondents.</b> In addition to the finding that {{a large majority of}} respondents rated their IT computers skills as at least average or above, results of this study provided some support for the use of Web-based survey techniques in terms of achieving an effective response rate and, to a lesser extent, comparability of early and late respondents. Recommendations stemming from this research include supporting further refinement of Web based survey techniques, including developing a model for comparing relevant variables, such as prior experience with Web surveys, computer and Web competencies, level, type and speed of computer access and overall motivation to use computers, as a means to verify and insure validity of online survey results...|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of interventions to improve pedestrian safety, whether involving engineering, education, or enforcement, {{is limited by}} the behavior of the public in response to the interventions. It is not difficult to imagine that the behavioral response of an individual to engineering and educational road safety interventions may be at least partially explained by demographic characteristics. It is also plausible that membership and interactions in a social group influences an individual’s behavior and attitudes about road safety and response to such interventions. This paper describes preliminary findings from a project that is employing a mixed survey framework of in-person gatherings and <b>online</b> <b>respondent</b> driven sampling surveys to explore how demographics, pedestrian safety education and social group membership and interaction explain an individual’s behavior and attitudes related to crossing a signalized intersection as a pedestrian in different physical and travel settings. This paper describes the findings from small size in-person samples. Multinomial logit modeling will be applied to predict stated pedestrian behavior. The results will shed light on pedestrian attitudes about traffic signal design and operation as well as identify how to most effectively improve pedestrian safety through education and social group interaction...|$|R

40|$|In Scotland we {{have carried}} out surveys of beekeepers since 2006, mainly by post. Since 2008 {{we have used}} {{geographically}} stratified random sampling of the membership records of the Scottish Beekeepers’ Association, excluding those who opted out of surveys, to select the invited participants. In 2013 our survey was conducted online, as far as possible, using the LimeSurvey software ([URL]) for the first time. This was repeated in 2014. In 2013, 300 participants were selected from 1094 possible participants, of whom 218 (73 %) had email contact details. Postal questionnaires {{were used for the}} others, those whose email failed or where there were technical problems: 94 questionnaires were posted and 3 sent electronically for postal return. Analysis of the 2012 - 2013 loss data gave 108 beekeeper respondents with valid loss data, of whom 56. 5 % experienced winter losses. The overall loss rate was 31. 6 % (158 colonies lost out of 500 colonies wintered). There were differing winter loss rates of 19. 3 % for the postal respondents and a much higher 36. 6 % for the <b>online</b> <b>respondents.</b> This difference is highly significant (Fisher's exact test gives a p-value of 0. 0001297). Eleven (50 %) of the 22 postal respondents and 50 (58. 1 %) of the 86 <b>online</b> <b>respondents</b> with valid loss data experienced losses, though this difference was not significant. The profile of the beekeepers differed between the two groups: the postal respondents were typically much more experienced beekeepers than the <b>online</b> <b>respondents.</b> It is therefore important for us to include the postal element for beekeepers not contactable by email, even though the response rate for the online survey was higher (65 % online; 36 % postal; 55 % overall). In the 2014 survey, 350 participants were chosen randomly from 1224 possible participants, 273 (78 %) had email contact details, and 95 questionnaires were posted, allowing for 17 failing emails and one person with difficulty accessing the survey. Preliminary results, based on 118 valid responses collected so far in LimeSurvey from beekeepers, are that 41 (34. 7 %) experienced losses over winter 2013 - 14, and that the loss rate was 13. 2 % (74 colonies lost from 560 wintered colonies). The final loss rates including postal responses may be expected to be lower. The 2012 - 13 winter loss rate of 31. 6 % was the highest since our surveys began, the next highest being 30. 9 % over winter 2009 - 10. It seems likely that the much lower loss rate this last winter can largely be attributed to the different weather conditions...|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{order to}} improve {{long-term}} outcomes for individuals with substance use problems, one approach is to adopt a system planning model that considers both addiction severity and life complexities. The tiered approach has been developed and tested to describe systems-level need based on levels of risk and problem severity. Methods: An existing tiered model was modified to accommodate Australian data, incorporating substance use severity and life complexity. The hypothesis was that tiers would reflect differences in well-being amongst help seekers such that an increase in tier {{would be associated with}} a reduction in well-being, suggesting the need for more intensive (and integrated) interventions. The model was tested using 2 data sets of screening data, collected from face-to-face alcohol and other drug (AOD) service (n = 430) and online help (n = 309) seekers, drawn from a larger sample of 2, 766 screens. The screen included demographic information and substance use, mental health, and quality of life measures. Results: There was a significant relationship between well-being and tier ranking, suggesting that the model adequately captured elements of severity and complexity that impact on well-being. There were notable differences between the help-seeking populations with a higher proportion of <b>online</b> <b>respondents</b> allocated to lower tiers and more face-to-face respondents allocated to higher tiers. However, there was an overlap in these populations, with more than half of <b>online</b> <b>respondents</b> classified as higher tiers and one fifth of face-to-face respondents classified as lower tiers. This suggests that the model can be used both to assess unmet need in out-of-treatment groups and demand in the absence of dependence in a subpopulation of the face-to-face treatment population. Conclusions: The tiered model provides a method to understand levels of AOD treatment need and, as part of needs-based planning, may be used to optimize treatment responses and resourcing...|$|E
