5|$|Five {{people have}} been {{depicted}} on U.S. currency during their lifetime. Abraham Lincoln was portrayed on the 1861 $10 Demand Note; Salmon Chase, Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury, approved his own portrait for the 1862 $1 Legal Tender Note; Winfield Scott was depicted <b>on</b> <b>Interest</b> Bearing Notes during the early 1860s; and Francis Spinner and Spencer Clark both approved {{the use of their}} own image on fractional currency. In 1873, driven in large part by the actions of Spinner and Clark, Congress prohibited the use of portraits of living people on any U.S. bond, security, note, or fractional or postal currency.|$|E
5|$|In recent decades, South Dakota {{has been}} {{transformed}} from a state dominated by agriculture to one with a more diversified economy. The tourism industry has grown considerably since {{the completion of the}} interstate system in the 1960s, with the Black Hills becoming more important as a destination. The financial service industry began to grow in the state as well, with Citibank moving its credit card operations from New York to Sioux Falls in 1981, a move that has been followed by several other financial companies. South Dakota was the first state to eliminate caps <b>on</b> <b>interest</b> rates.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the issue of {{competing}} great power interests in Central Asia, known for specialists in international relations as the New Great Game. The focus is in first hand <b>on</b> <b>interests</b> of the “Big Four” global powers and secondly, <b>on</b> the <b>interests</b> of a series of regional powers which can bring decisive contributions to the New Great Game. The analysis has two directions: one concentrated on strategic analysis, and the second focused <b>on</b> economic <b>interests...</b>|$|R

Both parties should discuss their interests and keep an open mind {{to the other side of}} the argument.|$|R

However, with all four members being from European countries, this may have had a potentially negative effect <b>on</b> <b>interest</b> in North America. It has also been argued that the dominance of the Big Four has made the game predictable or even boring.|$|E

5|$|At this point, Cochrane has {{completed}} {{the first two}} steps introducing his interest-based rights approach; the third is outlining the approach itself as the appropriate means of understanding obligations to animals in political communities. Utilitarianism, as advocated by Peter Singer, is rejected because of its failure to take individuals seriously enough; Cochrane desires an account which takes well-being seriously but is not purely aggregative. This, he suggests, is one based <b>on</b> <b>interest</b> rights. After explicating {{the details of his}} interest-based rights approach, Cochrane defends it against the charge that it would result in an unworkably large number of rights, and that rights approaches are too rationalistic.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Padayappa {{discovers that}} a hill on his {{property}} is solid granite, which allows him to start a granite business, from which he becomes rich. He uses the money {{to help the poor}} in his village, and provide them jobs. As his business flourishes, his family is able to once again settle down. Padayappa assumes his father's position as the village chieftain, and his sister gets married to one of the engineers who work in his company. When Neelambari learns about Padayappa's love for Vasundhara, she becomes jealous of her, and her parents beg Padayappa's widowed mother to allow Neelambari to marry Padayappa. However, to everyone's surprise, Padayappa's mother embarrasses Padayappa's maternal uncle in front of the entire village when she agrees to a marriage proposal made by Vasundhara's mother, her brother's servant. Unable to bear the humiliation, Padayappa's maternal uncle commits suicide. When Neelambari tries to kill Vasundhara by letting a bull loose on her, Padayappa saves her, after which the two marry. After the wedding, Neelambari locks herself in a room in Suryaprakash's house, thinking only about Padayappa for 18 years. In between, Padayappa finds his father's foster brother in trouble and was pulled out by a financier, from whom he had borrowed money <b>on</b> <b>interest</b> keeping the family house, and helps his father's foster brother, who is suffering financially. As a result, Padayappa's father's foster brother becomes indebted to him and seeks Padayappa's pardon for his misdeeds; Padayappa forgives him.|$|E

This target is changed periodically to achieve and maintain an inflation rate within a target range.

25|$|In the United States, the tax <b>on</b> <b>interest</b> {{income on}} life {{insurance}} policies and annuities is generally deferred.

This depends upon the insuring company, the type of policy and other variables (mortality, market return, etc.). Moreover, other income tax saving vehicles (e.g., IRAs, 401(k) plans, Roth IRAs) may be better alternatives for value accumulation.|$|E
