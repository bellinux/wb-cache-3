An early 20th century adherent of the Arya Samaji Hindu movement wrote in Rangila Rasul that Aisha was {{about the same age as}} Muhammad's granddaughter, and a better way for Muhammad to make Abu Bakr (Aisha's father) a relative would have been to adopt Aisha as his own daughter and marry her off. It is described in Bukhari that Aisha, while living with Muhammad, used to play with dolls along with her girlfriends. According to Katherine Zoepf, this description emphasising Aisha's childishness despite being married to a man then in his early fifties [...] "can make for upsetting reading." [...] Jeremy Stangroom and Ophelia Benson argue that Aisha [...] "was much too young to have offered anything like her informed consent , even if it had been sought". They also argue, [...] "there are difficulties in dismissing any of Muhammad's actions as simply being the product of his time given the status accorded to his life among Muslims." [...] They note that his life is considered exemplary for Muslims and one to which all Muslim men should aspire, quoting Kecia Ali: [...] "accepting the rightness of his act raises the question: <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>basis</b> can one reject the marriage of young girls today?"

Taney's May 26, 1861 order directed General George Cadwalader, commander of Fort McHenry, (1) to produce (but not release) Merryman for a hearing before Taney to be held the very next day, on May 27, 1861, and (2) to explain <b>on</b> <b>what</b> legal <b>basis</b> the Army had seized Merryman. General George Cadwalader did not produce Merryman. Instead, Cadwalader delivered a response which was read to the court. Cadwalader's response explained that he was acting under orders from President Lincoln, who had delegated authority to the military to suspend habeas corpus. Because Cadwalader failed to produce Merryman, Taney cited Cadwalader for contempt, and ordered the U.S. Marshal to serve an attachment order on Cadwalader. The U.S. Marshal was unable to serve the attachment order, as he was denied entrance to Fort McHenry. Thus, the contempt citation was never adjudicated. Furthermore, Taney declared Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus unconstitutional (see Ex parte Merryman).|$|R
