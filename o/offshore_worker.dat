40|$|The {{offshore}} {{oil and gas}} industry operates a diverse range of shift work schedules, with uncertainty as to which are the most appropriate in terms of health and safety. Night-shift work causes desynchronisation of the work and sleep periods with the circadian rhythm (body clock). Such desynchrony leads to reduced alertness, fatigue, disturbances to sleep and to the normal metabolic response to meals consumed at night, and consequently may be detrimental to health and safety. Previously it has been demonstrated that {{offshore oil}} installation workers can adapt their circadian rhythm to a night shift schedule, by advancing or delaying the rhythm timing, depending on the schedule and conditions. Light is the major factor controlling the timing of the circadian system. Increased light at night improves alertness and performance and may possibly improve metabolic responses to meals during night shift conditions. It is of interest to the offshore industry to identify which commonly operated offshore shift schedules allow circadian adaptation and whether this confers any benefit with regard to fatigue, performance and metabolism. This project was undertaken by the University of Surrey for the Health and Safety Executive with the following aims• • To measure changes in circadian phase during different offshore shift schedules • To investigate the amount and timing of light exposure in <b>offshore</b> <b>worker...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} two decades the growth of the {{offshore}} oil and gas industry of Western Australia has resulted in an increased number of families experiencing the intermittent absence of a partner/parent. The gendered nature of the offshore oil and gas industry means workers tend to be male and the partner left at home tends to be female. This was the case for the participants in this study. For two/three weeks the family experience the absence of the male 'breadwinner', creating a gap within the family as the women and children experiences the loss of the partner/parent. Two/three weeks later the male worker returns home for his rest period and he reengages in his roles and the family is reunited. When the worker is absent the partner at home takes on the worker's gendered roles, tasks and responsibilities; upon his return she surrenders (sometimes willingly) his gendered roles, tasks and responsibilities. Solheim (1988) state families of offshore oil and gas workers experience three social realities; his life at work, her 'single' life when he is at work, and their couple life when the worker arrives home. The families can develop a range of methods to adjust to the flux that occurs within families due to the work schedule (Forsyth and Gramling 1989). The repeated cyclical patterns of parting and reunion, weaving and balancing their three lives, and renegotiation of family work contribute to the stressors and strains the partners of offshore workers experience. This study investigated how the offshore lifestyle impacts the at home partner of offshore workers and in addition, how at home partners use their social networks as means to help adapt to the offshore work schedule, and makes two major findings. Firstly, the at home partners of offshore workers participate in exchanging, at various levels, social support with family, friends and neighbours, although the most important form of support which helps the at home partner adapt to the offshore lifestyle is the support they receive from the <b>offshore</b> <b>worker.</b> Secondly, adapting to the offshore lifestyle is highly influenced by a process consisting of four reactions. The reactions are: the beginning; normalising his presence; normalising his absence; and balancing two lives. The identification of the four reactions can provide a greater understanding of how the offshore oil and gas industry impacts on the daily lives of partners of offshore workers as it helps make visible the day-to-day lives of partners of offshore oil and gas workers...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Health {{management}} tools need to {{be developed}} to foster healthy ageing at work and sustain employability of ageing work-forces. The objectives of this study were to 1) perform a needs assessment to identify the needs of <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> in the Dutch Continental Shelf with regard to healthy ageing at work and 2) to define suitable program objectives for a future healthy ageing at work program in the offshore working population. METHODS: A mixed methods design was used applying an intervention mapping procedure. Qualitative data were gathered in N[*]=[*] 19 semi-structured interviews and six focus-group sessions (N[*]=[*] 49). Qualitative data were used to develop a questionnaire, which was administered among N[*]=[*] 450 <b>offshore</b> <b>workers.</b> Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate age-related differences relating to health status and work-related factors. RESULTS: The importance of good working environments, food, as well as sleep/fatigue management was identified by the qualitative data analysis. A total of 260 <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> completed the questionnaire. Significant differences in work ability were found between <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> aged 55 years (mean 8. 63 vs. 8. 22; p[*]=[*] 0. 028). <b>Offshore</b> <b>workers</b> had a high BMI (M[*]=[*] 27. 06, SD[*]=[*] 3. 67), with 46 % classified as overweight (BMI 25 - 30) and 21 % classified as obese (BMI > 30). A significant difference in BMI was found between <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> aged < 45 and ≥ 55 years (mean 26. 3 vs. 28. 6; p < 0. 001). In total, 73 % of <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> reported prolonged fatigue. A significant difference in fatigue scores was found between <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> aged < 45 and ≥ 55 years (mean 36. 0 vs. 37. 6; p[*]=[*] 0. 024). Further, a "dip" was reported by 41 % of <b>offshore</b> <b>workers.</b> Dips were mainly experienced at day 10 or 11 (60 %), with 45 % experiencing the dip both as physical and mental fatigue, whereas 39 % experienced the dip as only mental fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Both qualitative and quantitative analyses identified work, food and sleep/fatigue management as most important program objectives for a healthy ageing at work and sustainable employability program offshore. Future studies should investigate possible causes of dip occurrences and high fatigue scores to identify suitable interventions...|$|R

What kinds of jobs suffer, or benefit, most from the competition created by <b>offshore</b> and immigrant <b>workers?</b> In contrast to the existing literature that has mostly looked at the effects of offshoring and immigration separately, we argue that one can gain useful insights by jointly investigating the interactions among native, immigrant and <b>offshore</b> <b>workers.</b> We develop our argument in three steps. First, we present some new facts on 58 U. S. manufacturing industries from 2000 to 2007. Second, we build on Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) to design a model of task assignment among heterogeneous native, immigrant and <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> that fits those facts. Third, we use the model to draw systematic predictions {{about the effects of}} immigration and <b>offshoring</b> on native <b>workers</b> and we test these predictions on the data. We find that, within the manufacturing sector, immigrants do not compete much with natives, as these two groups of workers are relatively specialized in tasks at opposite ends of the skill intensity spectrum. <b>Offshore</b> <b>workers,</b> on the other hand, seem to be specialized in tasks of intermediate skill intensity. We also find that offshoring has no effect on native employment in the aggregate, while the effect of immigration on native employment is positive.

Formerly {{considered}} rare in sub-Saharan Africa, evidence has shown that urbanization and the adoption of more affluent and sedentary lifestyle in subpopulations of this region, may result in increased prevalence. One such subpopulation is workers in the Nigerian petroleum industry and this study examines their risk factors for coronary heart disease. In addition the study compares the risk profile of onshore and <b>offshore</b> <b>workers.</b> Method: This is a descriptive cross sectional study undertaken to determine the level of risk factors {{for the development of}} cardiovascular disease in two groups of male workers of the petroleum industry in Nigeria; the onshore and the <b>offshore</b> <b>workers.</b> Four hundred workers were randomnly selected and invited to participate, with a desired sample size of 234. The data was collected by using an electronic questionnaire to explore life style factors like exercise, diet, and smoking that predispose to this disease. Anthropometric indices included body mass index, waist circumference and waist to hip ratio. Biochemical tests included lipid profile and fasting blood glucose. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure was also recorded. The prevalence of known hypertension and diabetes as well as the metabolic syndrome were determined. The questionnaire data was analysed and compared with the chi-square test using the software, Epi-info 2008 Windows Version 3. 5. 1 and the means of the continuous variables were determined and compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: 121 onshore and 110 <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> participated. Overall the cardiovascular risk profile of onshore versus <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> in the oil industry was worse. Onshore workers had increased waist circumference,; though {{there was no significant difference}} in the Waist-Hip Ratio, increased rates of metabolic syndrome, diabetes and hypertension and were less physically active. Dietary differences were less marked, but more beef and chicken were consumed by onshore while more fish was consumed by <b>offshore</b> <b>workers.</b> Conversely the <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> had a higher BMI and lower levels of protective HDL. Overall, in this population, the BMI and the umber of diabetics were higher and the HDL lower than the country figures. Conclusion The obesity profile of the two groups was comparable to that of the Western nations and could become worse. This also reflects the fact that within Nigeria there are sub-populations with cardio-metabolic profiles that depart significantly from the national average.

40|$|My {{thesis is}} an ethnographic {{study of how}} <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> of Newfoundland and Labrador, {{as well as their}} families, express and reflect upon {{traditional}} Newfoundland constructs of fatherhood and masculinity through narrative and ritual. With a schedule that often involves a constant shift between home and away, <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> in the province take part in high-risk professions in order to provide for their families back home. These professions, and their associated lifestyles, involve the incorporation of routine strategies that allows family culture to maintain itself. At the same time, these professions largely carry on a tradition of hegemonically masculine practices, albeit in a newer context. Drawing on a blend of literary and ethnographic research based on the Avalon Peninsula, I utilize examples of current Newfoundland culture to describe how nostalgic memoirs of outport Newfoundland create models of hegemonically masculine fatherhood in the province. I go on to explain how those models manifest themselves in the experiences of current <b>offshore</b> <b>workers,</b> and how they affect their spouses and children. Furthermore, through examining how young adults with offshore-working parents describe their experiences of their fathers, it is possible to see how the effects of local hegemonic masculinities are manifested through narratives about fathers who worked away from home...|$|R

It ends by making recommendations for effective health, safety, and environmental (HSE) management. Review of the literature showed that contusion (bruise), cuts, and laceration are the commonest occupational injuries that workers on the oil rig suffer and that the injuries mostly affect the hand and finger, leg, and eyes of the <b>offshore</b> <b>workers.</b> These injuries were found to be caused mostly by direct stroke, jamming and overstrain. Similarly, accidental poisoning, musculoskeletal disorders, respiratory disorders and diseases of the digestive system were also documented as the commonest occupational diseases among <b>offshore</b> <b>workers.</b> The literature also shows that working offshore is associated with poorer psychological wellbeing or health; this is to say that <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> tend to experience higher levels of stress, burnout, anxiety, depression, low job satisfaction (particularly with the environmental conditions associated with their work), and sleep disorders. Finally, the literature review indicated that land-use problems, air pollution, acid rain, climate change, habitat disruption, environmental degradation, oil spills and leakages are some of environmental impacts of upstream oil production.

40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} is a vital contributor to the global economy and a key source of employment within oil-producing countries. Oil production is largely dependent on a skilled population who are adept in coping with the demands of an offshore environment. Due to the high risk nature of work offshore, it is a requisite that personnel engage in health promoting behaviours. The research aimed to identify aspects of <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> self care which required behaviour change and the behavioural determinants which were associated with engagement in self care. A mixed methods design was utilised to generate novel data and original findings. Phase 1 used a quantitative cross-sectional online survey to assess offshore workers’ (n= 352, 53. 6 % response rate) health, quality of life, mental wellbeing and self care status. The findings highlighted key areas of concern, as indicated by negative scoring across measures, relating to: overweight/obesity; medication adherence; absenteeism (with regard to travelling offshore); medical evacuation; lack of adherence to 5 -a-day fruit and vegetable guidelines; physical activity; smoking; hazardous alcohol use, and insomnia. Phase 2 used qualitative theory-based telephone interviews to explore self care behaviours from the perspective of <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> (n= 16). <b>Offshore</b> <b>workers</b> who had completed a survey and indicated they would like to receive further information on the interviews were invited to participate. Both the interview schedule and data analysis were informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Healthy eating and physical activity were the behaviours most frequently discussed by <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> and identified as areas requiring behaviour change. TDF domains representing both behaviours included: beliefs about capabilities; beliefs about consequences; intentions; goals; memory, attention and decision processes; environmental context and resources; social influences; emotion, and behavioural regulation. Phase 3 used qualitative theory-based telephone interviews to explore offshore workers’ (n= 13) self care behaviours from the perspective of remote healthcare practitioners. Both the interview schedule and data analysis were informed by TDF. Healthy eating and harmful/hazardous alcohol use were the behaviours most frequently discussed by remote healthcare practitioners and identified as areas requiring behaviour change. TDF domains representing both behaviours included: knowledge; environmental context and resources; social influences; emotion, and behavioural regulation. The findings, when triangulated suggest that <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> may benefit from the implementation of a self care intervention which targets healthy eating, physical activity and alcohol consumption. It is advised that the intervention target multiple self care behaviours and that development is underpinned by behaviour change theory to ensure effectiveness.

40|$|Objectives - In 1984, male UK <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> {{had greater}} {{overweight}} and obesity prevalence and fat content {{than the general}} population. Since then, body weight has increased by 19 %, but, without accompanying anthropometric measures, their size increase, current obesity, and fatness prevalence remain unknown. This study therefore aimed to acquire contemporary anthropometric data, profile changes since the original survey, and assess current obesity prevalence in the male offshore workforce. Methods - A total of 588 men, recruited via quota sampling to match the workforce weight profile, underwent stature, weight, and 3 D photonic scanning measurements from which anatomical girths were extracted, enabling computation of body mass index (BMI), total fat, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Results - On average, UK male <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> are now 8. 1 y older, 3. 1 cm taller, 13. 9 kg heavier, and have greater girths than in 1984, which are > 97 % attributable to increased weight, and < 3 % to age difference. Mean BMI increased significantly from 24. 9 to 28. 1 kg/m 2 and of the contemporary sample, 18 % have healthy weight, 52 % are overweight, and 30 % obese, representing an increase in overweight and obesity prevalence by 6 % and 24 %, respectively. Waist cutoffs identify 39 % of the contemporary sample as healthy, 27 % at increased health risk, and 34 % at high risk. Conclusions - UK <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> today have higher BMI than Scottish men, although some muscular individuals may be misclassified by BMI.

40|$|Background: UK male <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> {{typically}} {{increased in}} weight by 19 % since 1985, {{and are also}} heavier than the background UK male population. Aim: To conduct an anthropometric survey on UK <b>offshore</b> <b>workers,</b> employing the latest portable 3 D scanning technology, to quantify size and shape change associated with weight increase and identify differing physique groups among the sample. Method: 588 male <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> within seven pre-determined weight categories were scanned, using the Artec L portable 3 D scanner, in three different postures; whilst wearing form-fitting clothing and while wearing a survival suit. 404 of the 588 participants also undertook a helicopter window escape task. Results: The sample population had average weight of 90. 5 kg, and matched the weight distribution of the workforce {{population as a whole}} (chi squared= 11. 7; 11 df, P> 0. 05). Five extracted girths (neck, chest, waist, hip and wrist) were found be 13. 5 % greater than in 1985, with the highest average measurement 17. 3 % greater at the waist. The 99 th percentile of extracted measures had increased more than twice that of the 1 st percentile (18. 3 % v 8. 9 % increase respectively). The reliability of extracted measures was high with average TEM of 1. 15 %. 11 distinct physique clusters were identified, across four morphological somatotypes, displaying a tendency towards endomorphic and mesomorphic phenotypes and a predisposition towards obesity (average BMI= 28. 3 kg/m 2). 51 % of the sample successfully passed through the smallest industry standard escape exit, with the best morphological prediction of window egress giving a predictive accuracy of 73. 5 %. Conclusion: The dramatic increase in size and shape within the offshore workforce over the last 30 years represents an ‘expanding universe’ of physique and weight variability. The challenge this presents to designers is considerable in ensuring the on-going ergonomic fit of the industry’s working environment for the offshore population. Oil and Gas UK...|$|R

The Cancer Registry of Norway has, {{in collaboration with the}} Norwegian oil industry association, started a project investigating cancer risk and cause-specific mortality among workers in the Norwegian offshore oil industry. The project started in 1996 by identifying the 61, 300 present and former workers on the platforms on the Norwegian continental shelf. The main contributors to the crew lists were oil companies, contracting companies, labour unions, safety training schools, and the national archives of Norway. In 1998 a selfadministered questionnaire was distributed by mail to the 57, 000 workers alive and living in Norway. The questionnaire included questions on offshore job history, other occupations, leisure activities, and life-style factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption and nutrition. The study design of the project is a prospective cohort study, where cancer incidence and mortality among the exposed (the <b>offshore</b> <b>workers)</b> will be compared with the non-exposed (the general population). Factors known to cause cancer and other diseases in other industries are probably present in the offshore work environment. The <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> may also be exposed to harmful agents more or less specific for the work on the platforms, such as crude oil, gas, and drilling mud. Intense work periods and long leave periods, a diet rich in fat and calories, cheap tobacco, a ban on alcohol consumption on the platform, and worry about helicopter flights and platform safety are also factors that may influence the workers' health. The overall response rate was 62 %. The collected material will constitute a basis for research in the coming decades. With regular intervals the cohort will be linked to the cancer database in the Cancer Registry and the Cause of Death Registry at Statistics Norway. Because they are a highly selected group, the <b>offshore</b> <b>workers</b> as a whole will probably be as healthy as the general population, yet excesses in cancer incidence and certain causes of death among the most exposed workers (i. e., maintenance workers, drilling personnel, welders, painters and cleaners) are expected.  </p...|$|R
