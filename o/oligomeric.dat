5|$|Surfactant protein A (SP-A) is {{a protein}} of 248 amino acids usually found in large <b>oligomeric</b> {{structure}}s. The mature SP-A1 monomer is a 35kDa protein that differs from SP-A2 in four amino acids at the coding region. The structure of SP-A1 monomers {{consists of four}} domains: an N-terminal, a collagen-like domain, a neck region, and a carbohydrate recognition domain. The C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) allows binding to various types of microorganisms and molecules.|$|E
5|$|The {{hydroxides}} {{themselves are}} the most basic hydroxides known, reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give <b>oligomeric</b> alkoxides. They easily react with carbon dioxide to form carbonates or bicarbonates, or with hydrogen sulfide to form sulfides or bisulfides, and {{may be used to}} separate thiols from petroleum. They react with amphoteric oxides: for example, the oxides of aluminium, zinc, tin, and lead react with the alkali metal hydroxides to give aluminates, zincates, stannates, and plumbates. Silicon dioxide is acidic, and thus the alkali metal hydroxides can also attack silicate glass.|$|E
25|$|Some {{proteins}} that are disordered or helical as monomers, such as amyloid β (see amyloid plaque) can form β-sheet-rich <b>oligomeric</b> structures associated with pathological states. The amyloid β protein's <b>oligomeric</b> form is implicated {{as a cause}} of Alzheimer's. Its structure has yet to be determined in full, but recent data suggest that it may resemble an unusual two-strand β-helix.|$|E
25|$|Domain {{swapping}} is {{a mechanism}} for forming <b>oligomeric</b> assemblies. In domain swapping, a secondary or tertiary element of a monomeric protein is replaced by the same element of another protein. Domain swapping can range from secondary structure elements to whole structural domains. It also represents a model of evolution for functional adaptation by oligomerisation, e.g. <b>oligomeric</b> enzymes that have their active site at subunit interfaces.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{extracellular}} amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), inflammation in {{the form}} of reactive astrocytes and microglia, and neuronal loss are all consistent pathological features of AD, a mechanistic link between these factors is yet to be clarified. Although the majority of past research has focused on fibrillar Aβ, soluble <b>oligomeric</b> Aβ species are now considered to be of major pathological importance in AD. Up-regulation of GSH may be protective against the oxidative and neurotoxic effects of <b>oligomeric</b> Aβ.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oligomeric</b> procyanidins {{have been}} {{proposed}} to offer protection to human vascular cells, with other research indicating that red wine polyphenols reduce absorption of malondialdehyde which is implicated in elevating levels of low-density lipoprotein in the onset of arteriosclerosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{stereoselective}} {{formation of}} enolates has been rationalized with the Ireland model, although its validity is somewhat questionable. In most cases, {{it is not}} known which, if any, intermediates are monomeric or <b>oligomeric</b> in nature; nonetheless, the Ireland model remains a useful tool for understanding enolates.|$|E
25|$|Applications of OLEDs {{in solid}} state {{lighting}} require {{the achievement of}} high brightness with good CIE coordinates (for white emission). The use of macromolecular species like polyhedral <b>oligomeric</b> silsesquioxanes (POSS) {{in conjunction with the}} use of phosphorescent species such as Ir for printed OLEDs have exhibited brightnesses as high as 10,000cd/m2.|$|E
25|$|Many {{proteins}} have a quaternary structure, {{which consists}} of several polypeptide chains that associate into an <b>oligomeric</b> molecule. Each polypeptide chain in such a protein is called a subunit. Hemoglobin, for example, consists of two α and two β subunits. Each of the four chains has an all-α globin fold with a heme pocket.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to SDS, proteins may optionally be briefly heated to near boiling {{in the presence}} of a reducing agent, such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or 2-mercaptoethanol (beta-mercaptoethanol/BME), which further denatures the proteins by reducing disulfide linkages, thus overcoming some forms of tertiary protein folding, and breaking up quaternary protein structure (<b>oligomeric</b> subunits). This is known as reducing SDS-PAGE.|$|E
25|$|In {{molecular}} biology, trimeric autotransporter adhesins (TAAs), are proteins {{found on}} the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Bacteria use TAAs in order to infect their host cells via a process called cell adhesion. TAAs also go by another name, <b>oligomeric</b> coiled-coil adhesins, which is shortened to OCAs. In essence, they are virulence factors, factors that make the bacteria harmful and infective to the host organism.|$|E
25|$|For nucleic acids, urea is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used denaturant. For proteins, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is an anionic detergent applied to protein samples to coat proteins in order to impart two negative charges (from every SDS molecule) to every two amino acids of the denatured protein. 2-Mercaptoethanol may also be used to disrupt the disulfide bonds found between the protein complexes, which helps further denature the protein. In most proteins, the binding of SDS to the polypeptide chain imparts an even distribution of charge per unit mass, thereby resulting in a fractionation by approximate size during electrophoresis. Proteins that have a greater hydrophobic content – for instance, many membrane proteins, and those that interact with surfactants in their native environment – are intrinsically harder to treat accurately using this method, due to the greater variability in the ratio of bound SDS. Procedurally, using both Native and SDS-PAGE together can be used to purify and to separate the various subunits of the protein. Native-PAGE keeps the <b>oligomeric</b> form intact and will show a band on the gel that is representative of the level of activity. SDS-PAGE will denature and separate the <b>oligomeric</b> form into its monomers, showing bands that are representative of their molecular weights. These bands can be used to assess the purity of and identify the protein.|$|E
25|$|Guidelines {{outlining}} {{requirements for}} inclusion of soluble biomarkers in osteoarthritis clinical trials {{were published in}} 2015, but as yet, there are no validated biomarkers for osteoarthritis. A 2015 systematic review of biomarkers for osteoarthritis looking for molecules {{that could be used}} for risk assessments found 37 different biochemical markers of bone and cartilage turnover in 25 publications. The strongest evidence was for urinary C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type II (uCTX-II) as a prognostic marker for knee osteoarthritis progression and serum cartilage <b>oligomeric</b> protein (COMP) levels as a prognostic marker for incidence of both knee and hip osteoarthritis. A review of biomarkers in hip osteoarthritis also found associations with uCTXII.|$|E
25|$|The {{cholera toxin}} (CTX or CT) is an <b>oligomeric</b> complex {{made up of}} six protein subunits: a single copy of the A subunit (part A), and five copies of the B subunit (part B), {{connected}} by a disulfide bond. The five B subunits form a five-membered ring that binds to GM1 gangliosides {{on the surface of}} the intestinal epithelium cells. The A1 portion of the A subunit is an enzyme that ADP-ribosylates G proteins, while the A2 chain fits into the central pore of the B subunit ring. Upon binding, the complex is taken into the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the disulfide bond is reduced, and the A1 subunit is freed to bind with a human partner protein called ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6). Binding exposes its active site, allowing it to permanently ribosylate the Gs alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. This results in constitutive cAMP production, which in turn leads to the secretion of water, sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate into the lumen of the small intestine and rapid dehydration. The gene encoding the cholera toxin was introduced into V. cholerae by horizontal gene transfer. Virulent strains of V. cholerae carry a variant of a temperate bacteriophage called CTXφ.|$|E

500|$|Covalent bonding {{first comes}} to {{prominence}} in the tetrafluorides: those of zirconium, hafnium and several actinides are ionic with high melting points, while those of titanium, vanadium, and niobium are polymeric, melting or decomposing at no more than 350°C (660°F). Pentafluorides continue this trend with their linear polymers and <b>oligomeric</b> complexes. Thirteen metal hexafluorides are known, all octahedral, and are mostly volatile solids but for liquid [...] and , and gaseous [...] Rhenium heptafluoride, the only characterized metal heptafluoride, is a low-melting molecular solid with pentagonal bipyramidal molecular geometry. Metal fluorides with more fluorine atoms are particularly reactive.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>oligomeric</b> {{forms of}} IgA in the {{external}} (mucosal) secretions also contain a polypeptide {{of a much larger}} molecular mass (70 kD) called the secretory component that is produced by epithelial cells. [...] This molecule originates from the poly-Ig receptor (130 kD) that is responsible for the uptake and transcellular transport of <b>oligomeric</b> (but not monomeric) IgA across the epithelial cells and into secretions such as tears, saliva, sweat and gut fluid.|$|E
2500|$|Distillation of {{the mixture}} gives {{a mixture of}} <b>oligomeric</b> polyisocyanates, known as {{polymeric}} MDI, and a mixture of MDI isomers which has a low 2,4' isomer content. [...] Further purification entails fractionation of the MDI isomer mixture.|$|E

2500|$|Biochemical and {{preliminary}} {{clinical studies}} have demonstrated potential biological properties of grape seed <b>oligomeric</b> procyanidins. For example, laboratory tests indicated a potential anticancer effect from grape seed extract. According to the American Cancer Society, [...] "there is very little reliable scientific evidence available {{at this time that}} drinking red wine, eating grapes, or following the grape diet can prevent or treat cancer in people".|$|E
2500|$|The {{association}} of a protein with a lipid bilayer may involve significant changes within tertiary {{structure of a}} protein. These may include the folding of regions of protein structure that were previously unfolded [...] or a re-arrangement in the folding or a refolding of the membrane-associated part of the proteins [...] It also may involve the formation or dissociation of protein quaternary structures or <b>oligomeric</b> complexes, and specific binding of ions, ligands, or regulatory lipids.|$|E
2500|$|Caspases [...] {{play the}} {{central role in the}} {{transduction}} of ER apoptotic signals. Caspases are proteins that are highly conserved, cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases. There are two types of caspases: initiator caspases, caspase 2,8,9,10,11,12, and effector caspases, caspase 3,6,7. The activation of initiator caspases requires binding to specific <b>oligomeric</b> activator protein. Effector caspases are then activated by these active initiator caspases through proteolytic cleavage. The active effector caspases then proteolytically degrade a host of intracellular proteins to carry out the cell death program.|$|E
2500|$|Copper halides {{react with}} organolithium {{reagents}} to give organocopper compounds. The area was pioneered by Henry Gilman, who reported methylcopper in 1936. Thus, phenylcopper is prepared by reaction of phenyllithium with copper(I) bromide in diethyl ether. [...] Grignard reagents {{can be used}} in place of organolithium compounds. [...] Gilman also investigated the dialkylcuprates. These are obtained by combining two equivalent of RLi with Cu(I) salts. Alternatively, these cuprates are prepared from <b>oligomeric</b> neutral organocopper compounds by treatment with one equivalent of organolithium reagent.|$|E
2500|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} shown that a genetic {{component}} may be an important risk factor in OA. [...] Insulin-like growth factor I genes (IGF-1), Transforming growth factorβ, cartilage <b>oligomeric</b> matrix protein, bone morphogenetic protein, and other anabolic gene candidates are among the candidate genes for OA. [...] Genetic changes in OA can lead to defects of a structural protein such as collagen, or changes in the metabolism of bone and cartilage. OA is rarely considered as a simple disorder following Mendelian inheritance being predominantly a multifactorial disease.|$|E
2500|$|Methyllithium is the {{simplest}} organolithium reagent with the empirical formula CH3Li. This s-block organometallic compound adopts an <b>oligomeric</b> structure both in solution {{and in the}} solid state. This highly reactive compound, invariably used as a solution in ethers, is a reagent in organic synthesis as well as organometallic chemistry. [...] Operations involving methyllithium require anhydrous conditions, because the compound is highly reactive toward water. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are also incompatible with MeLi. Methyllithium is usually not prepared, but purchased as a solution in various ethers.|$|E
2500|$|The Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) {{model for}} concerted {{allosteric}} transitions went {{a step further}} by exploring cooperativity based on thermodynamics and three-dimensional conformations. It was originally formulated for <b>oligomeric</b> proteins with symmetrically arranged, identical subunits, {{each of which has}} one ligand binding site. According to this framework, two (or more) interconvertible conformational states of an allosteric protein coexist in a thermal equilibrium. The states [...] - often termed tense (T) and relaxed (R) - differ in affinity for the ligand molecule. The ratio between the two states is regulated by the binding of ligand molecules that stabilizes the higher-affinity state. Importantly, all subunits of a molecule change states at the same time, a phenomenon known as [...] "concerted transition". The MWC model is illustrated in Figure 3.|$|E
2500|$|Systemic {{acquired}} resistance (SAR) {{is another}} example of resistance that is better understood in plants because of research done in A. thaliana. [...] Benzothiadiazol (BTH), a salicylic acid (SA) analog, has been used historically as an antifungal compound in crop plants. [...] BTH, as well as SA, has been shown to induce SAR in plants. [...] The initiation of the SAR pathway was first demonstrated in A. thaliana in which increased SA levels are recognized by nonexpresser of PR genes 1 (NPR1) [...] due to redox change in the cytosol, resulting in the reduction of NPR1. [...] NPR1, which usually exists in a multiplex (<b>oligomeric)</b> state, becomes monomeric (a single unit) upon reduction. [...] When NPR1 becomes monomeric, it translocates to the nucleus, were it interacts with many TGA transcription factors, and is able to induce pathogen-related genes such as PR1. Another example of SAR would be the research done with transgenic tobacco plants, which express bacterial salicylate hydroxylase, nahG gene, requires the accumulation of SA for its expression ...|$|E
2500|$|In resting cells, axin {{molecules}} oligomerize {{with each}} other through their C-terminal DIX domains, which have two binding interfaces. Thus they can build linear oligomers or even polymers inside the cytoplasm of cells. DIX domains are unique: the only other protein known to have a DIX domain is Dishevelled. (The single Dsh protein of Drosophila corresponds to three paralogous genes, Dvl1, Dvl2 and Dvl3 in mammals.) Dsh associates with the cytoplasmic regions of Frizzled receptors with its PDZ and DEP domains. When a Wnt molecule binds to Frizzled, it induces a poorly known cascade of events, that result in the exposure of dishevelled's DIX domain {{and the creation of}} a perfect binding site for axin. Axin is then titrated away from its <b>oligomeric</b> assemblies – the β-catenin destruction complex – by Dsh. Once bound to the receptor complex, axin will be rendered incompetent for β-catenin binding and GSK3 activity. Importantly, the cytoplasmic segments of the Frizzled-associated LRP5 and LRP6 proteins contain GSK3 pseudo-substrate sequences (Pro-Pro-Pro-Ser-Pro-x-Ser), appropriately [...] "primed" [...] (pre-phosphorylated) by CKI, as if it were a true substrate of GSK3. These false target sites greatly inhibit GSK3 activity in a competitive manner. [...] This way receptor-bound axin will abolish mediating the phosphorylation of β-catenin. Since beta-catenin is no longer marked for destruction, but continues to be produced, its concentration will increase. Once β-catenin levels rise high enough to saturate all binding sites in the cytoplasm, it will also translocate into the nucleus. Upon engaging the transcription factors LEF1, TCF1, TCF2 or TCF3, β-catenin forces them to disengage their previous partners: Groucho proteins. Unlike Groucho, that recruit transcriptional repressors (e.g. histone-lysine methyltransferases), beta-catenin will bind transcriptional activators, switching on target genes.|$|E

Side chains have noteworthy influence on a polymer's properties, mainly its crystallinity and density.
