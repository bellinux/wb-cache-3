2500|$|If a {{horse is}} kept in a pasture, the amount of land needed for basic {{maintenance}} varies with climate, an animal needs more land for grazing in a dry climate than in a moist one. [...] An average of between one and [...] of land per horse will provide adequate forage {{in much of the}} world, though hay or <b>other</b> <b>feed</b> may have to be supplemented in winter or during periods of drought. To lower the risk of laminitis, horses also may need to be removed from lush, rapidly changing grass for short periods in the spring and fall (autumn), when the grass is particularly high in non-structural carbohydrates such as fructans. [...] Horses turned out to pasture full time still need to be checked frequently for evidence of injury, parasites, sickness or weight loss.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made on}} the juveniles of a commercially important and cultivable species of second largest freshwater prawn Macrobrachium malcolmsonii for its responses to unilateral eyestalk ablation, different diets and some biochemical aspects. Protein content of the adult Artemia fed animals was {{higher than that of}} artificial feeds 1 and 2, oyster and earthworm fed eyestalk ablated prawns. In intact control animals, protein content was differ significantly when the animals were fed with different feeds except the artificial feed 1 and oyster. Eyestalk ablation had no significant effect on the body carbohydrate content of M. malcolmsonii fed with different feeds. The lipid content of the eyestalk ablated and intact control animals fed with adult Artemia showed significantly higher values when compared to <b>other</b> <b>feeds.</b> The content of free amino acids in eyestalk ablated animal fed with adult Artemia and earthworm was significantly higher from those fed with <b>other</b> <b>feeds.</b> Intact control animals offered with adult Artemia showed significantly higher contents of free amino acids as compared to those fed with <b>other</b> <b>feeds.</b> The eyestalk ablation had no effect on water content. The ash content of the eyestalk ablated animals fed with oyster and earthworm was significantly higher than those fed with <b>other</b> <b>feeds.</b> The intact control animals showed higher ash content when fed with earthworm, oyster and artificial feed 2 than those fed with <b>other</b> <b>feeds.</b> The energy content of the eyestalk ablated and intact control animals fed with adult Artemia was significantly higher than those fed with <b>other</b> <b>feeds...</b>|$|R

40|$|The in situ ruminal {{dry matter}} (DM) and crude protein (CP) {{degradation}} and in vitro DM and CP disappearance of corn grain, soybean meal, wheat bran and alfalfa were compared. For in situ technique duplicate dacron bags were incubated for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 h in two wethers fitted with ruminal cannulas. The in vitro degradability of DM and CP calculated at 0, 2, 12, 36 and 48 h incubation time for test feeds. The model of Ã˜rskov and McDonald as y = a + b (1 -e-ct) {{was used for}} determination of degradation characteristics for both of methods. Wheat bran had higher soluble DM (a) (30. 3 %), corn grain had higher insoluble potentially degradable DM (b) (59. 9 %) and soybean meal had higher degradation rate (9. 67 % h - 1 ) than <b>other</b> <b>feeds,</b> inverses corn grain (14 %), alfalfa (40. 1 %) and alfalfa (3. 40 % h- 1 ) had lower soluble DM, insoluble potentially degradable DM and degradation rate than <b>other</b> <b>feeds,</b> respectively. Wheat bran had higher soluble CP (a) (33. 3 %), corn grain had higher insoluble potentially degradable CP (b) (54. 5 %) and soybean meal had higher degradation rate (9. 78 % h- 1 ) than <b>other</b> <b>feeds,</b> inverses soybean meal (5. 7 %), alfalfa (43. 9 %) and alfalfa (3. 75 % h- 1 ) had lower soluble CP, insoluble potentially degradable CP and degradation rate than <b>other</b> <b>feeds,</b> respectively. There were differences (pin situ dry matter and crude protein degradation and in vitro dry matter and crude protein disappearance. The key protein parameters in the proposed Metabolizable protein system, quick digestible protein, slowly digestible protein and digestible undegradable protein are derived from measurements of the rates of degradation of feed proteins suspended in a dacron bag in the rumen. The Metabolizable protein of soybean meal (381 g kg- 1 ) was numerically rather than the <b>other</b> <b>feeds</b> and for corn grain (86 g kg- 1 ) was numerically less than the <b>other</b> <b>feeds...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Livestock production, {{including}} feed {{production and}} grazing, uses about 30% of the earth’s ice-free terrestrial surface: about 26% for grazing and about 4% for <b>other</b> <b>feed</b> production. [...] The intensity {{and duration of}} grazing use vary greatly [...] and these, together with terrain, vegetation and climate, influence the nature and importance of grazing’s environmental impact, which can range from severe to negligible, {{and in some cases}} (as noted below) beneficial. Excessive use of vegetation by grazing can be especially conducive to land degradation in dry areas.|$|E
50|$|A walking foot {{replaces the}} {{stationary}} presser foot with one that moves along with whatever <b>other</b> <b>feed</b> mechanisms the machine already has. As the walking foot moves, it shifts the workpiece along with it. It is most useful for sewing heavy materials where needle feed is mechanically inadequate, for spongy or cushioned materials where lifting the foot {{out of contact}} with the material helps in the feeding action, and for sewing many layers together where a drop feed will cause the lower layers to shift out of position with the upper layers.|$|E

Between 1910 and 1913 the carriage house, log cabin, blacksmith shop, and observation tower were added to the site by the Lillies to accommodate their growing businesses. In 1926, to meet the need for larger livestock accommodations, the Lillies built an impressive three story barn. The barn housed Pawnee Bill's herd of Scottish Shorthorn cattle. Its basement level sheltered the ranch horses while the second floor provided housing for the cattle. The top was used as storage for alfalfa and <b>other</b> <b>feed</b> crops harvested from the ranch property.|$|E
5000|$|While some after market {{magazines}} may {{not work}} well with the pistol, a simple adjustment of the magazine lips can often solve the problem. <b>Other</b> <b>feed</b> issues are often solved by polishing the feed ramp, switching to another brand of ammunition, or simply honoring the industry standard [...] "break in period" [...] to give both the firearm and magazines a chance to properly break in and mate moving parts. The suggested break in period for Hi-Point pistols is between 100 and 200 rounds.

50|$|Dr. Beauchemin’s {{research}} in the area of rumen function has led to guidelines that minimize ruminal acidosis in dairy cows and feedlot cattle, while maintaining high levels of animal production. She studied the dietary factors that contribute to subacute ruminal acidosis, as well as the role of physically effective fiber in stimulating rumen function and digestion.The results from these studies have contributed to dietary fiber recommendations for cattle. Dr. Beauchemin is also internationally recognized for her work in the area of improving the utilization of forages by ruminants through the use of feed enzyme technology and <b>other</b> <b>feed</b> additives. The focus of her work has been to identify the mechanisms of action whereby enzymesimprove feed digestion, such that feed enzymes that ensure positive and consistent results can be developed for the cattle industry.|$|E
