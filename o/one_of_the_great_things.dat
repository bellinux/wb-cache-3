[...] "There was no question. I saw Frank and I knew it. He's the guy. He's a wonderful actor, and he's going to kill it in this role." [...] Bernthal admitted that he had no prior knowledge of The Walking Dead. He reminisced that he reacted so [...] "organically" [...] to the script that he [...] "didn't want to be colored by anything else. When I did read the comic, I was shocked. Look, I'm not going to sit here and regret. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>things</b> about doing TV versus film is to be surprised yourself, to not let where you're going color where you are." [...] The pilot episode's script was amongst several other scripts for proposed television pilots that Bernthal skimmed through; He felt that this script overshadowed the others. [...] " [...] pilot season, and I read everything that was out there. I still remember the day that I got this script. I told my agent that I'd be thrilled to be an extra in this, it's so good. It just blew the rest of them right out of the water." ...|$|E

6000|$|Just a word {{to thank}} you--so inadequately--for everything. Your letter of the 1st {{infinitely}} appeals to me, and the 3d vol. of the amazing Vladimir (amazing for acharnement over her subject) has rejoiced my heart the more that I had quite given up expecting it. The two first vols. had long ago deeply held me--but I had at last had to suppose them but a colossal fragment. Fortunately the whole thing proves less fragmentary than colossal, and our dear old George ressort more and more prodigious the nearer one gets to her. The passages you marked contribute indeed most to this ineffable effect--and the long letter to sweet Solange is surely one of the rarest fruits of the human intelligence, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>things</b> of literature. And what a value it all gets from our memory of that wondrous day when we explored the very scene where they pigged so thrillingly together. What a crew, what moeurs, what habits, what conditions and relations every way--and what an altogether mighty and marvellous George!--not diminished by all the greasiness and smelliness in which she made herself (and so many other persons!) at home. Poor gentlemanly, crucified Chop!--not naturally at home in grease--but having been originally pulled in--and floundering there at last to extinction! Ce qui d√©passe, however--and it makes the last word about dear old G. really--is her overwhelming glibness, as exemplified, e.g., in her long letter to Gryzmala (or whatever his name,) the one to the first page or two of which your pencil-marks refer me, and in which she [...] "posts" [...] him, as they say at Stockbridge, as to all her amours. To have such a flow of remark on that subject, and everything connected with it, at her command helps somehow to make one feel that Providence laid up for the French such a store of remark, in advance and, as it were, should the worst befall, that their conduct and moeurs, coming after, had positively to justify and do honour to the whole collection of formulae, phrases and, as I say, glibnesses--so that as there were at any rate such things there for them to inevitably say, why not simply {{do all the things}} that would give them a rapport and a sense? The things we, poor disinherited race, do, we have to do so dimly and sceptically, without the sense of any such beautiful cadres awaiting us--and therefore poorly and going but half--or a tenth--of the way. It makes a difference when you have to invent your suggestions and glosses all after the fact: you do it so miserably compared with Providence--especially Providence aided by the French language: which by the way convinces me that Providence thinks and really expresses itself only in French, the language of gallantry. It will be a joy when we can next converse on these and cognate themes--I know of no such link of true interchange as a community of interest in dear old George.|$|E

50|$|The scheme {{consists}} of two buildings, the Bonnington and Stonebyres station. Both of these stations have a similar layout, they are single story buildings constructed with reinforced concrete. They both have large round-topped arched windows, and smaller rectangular windows, with a large flat-topped roof. Water is abstracted at intakes above from Bonnington Linn and Corra Linn. This process is done by an automatic tilting weir that regulates the flow and maintains the head of water. It has three pivoting counterbalanced gates. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>things</b> about being next to the falls, {{is that there is}} year-round operation of the stations. This means that the stations do not need a reservoir to keep the water in because the water from the falls is enough to sustain it. There is almost constant operation, due to the water levels at the Clydes Falls. In 1970, both the Bonnington Power Station and the Stonebyres Power Station, started using induction generators instead of synchronous generators.|$|E
