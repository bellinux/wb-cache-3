5|$|Taller, heavier {{buildings}} such as skyscrapers {{also required}} stronger foundations than smaller buildings. Earlier buildings had typically rested their foundations on rubble, {{which was in}} turn laid down on the soft top layer of the ground called the <b>overburden.</b> As buildings became taller and heavier, the <b>overburden</b> could not support their weight, and foundations increasingly needed to rest directly on the bedrock below. In both New York and Chicago this required digging down a considerable distance through soft soil and often below the water table, risking the hole filling up with water before the foundations were complete. The deeper the foundations needed to be, the greater the challenge. Special water-tight boxes called caissons were invented {{to deal with this}} problem in England in 1830 and adopted in the U.S. during the 1850s and 1860s.|$|E
5|$|Elcor was {{a mining}} location, {{built by the}} mining company to house the workers for its mines. People were allowed to own their homes, but the land on which the houses stood belonged to the mining company. After the Corsica mine closed in 1954, Pickands Mather and Company ordered the {{residents}} to vacate the property {{so that it could}} reclaim the land; by 1956, Elcor was completely abandoned. The desolate property changed hands often through acquisitions, mergers and bankruptcies. In 1993 the Inland Steel Company began stripping the <b>overburden</b> from Elcor's former location for what is now the Minorca mine.|$|E
40|$|Putian Municipal People's GovernmentIn {{consideration}} {{of the need to}} maintain planting-breeding balance, this article examines the capacity of the soil in Putian City, Fujian Province to absorb livestock and poultry excreta, and computes the environmental carrying capacity for livestock and poultry farming (ECCLPF) in each district of the city in terms of the fertility characteristics of the soil in the city, as well as its mix of crops cultivated and farming methods. On the basis of the computations, this work proceeds to classify the alarm grades of the city's environmental carrying capacity for livestock and poultry framing, and assess the environmental impact of the livestock and poultry farming industry. The results of our study indicate that, the city's ECCLPF ranges from 8. 27 to 23. 23 heads per ha when computed on the basis of nitrogen, and from 5. 79 to 24. 53 heads per ha when computed on the basis of phosphorus. A comparison between our research findings and the existing farming scale in Putian reveals that, in certain parts of the city, ECCLPF is <b>overburdened</b> to varying degrees. Specifically, Cheng) dang District is severely <b>overburdened,</b> Hanjiang District and Meizhou Island have a level of <b>overburdening</b> between virtual <b>overburdening</b> and significant <b>overburdening,</b> Licheng District is virtually <b>overburdened,</b> and Xiuyu, Xianyou, and Bei'an Districts have not exceeded their environmental carrying capacity and therefore have varying levels of potential for growth...|$|R

5|$|In fall 1903, {{the flood}} of miners leaving the Tanana Valley ended when major gold strikes were made north of Fairbanks. The gold was deeper than in the Klondike, and it had taken time to dig to it. At Cleary Creek, miner Jesse Noble {{discovered}} what became the richest vein of gold in Alaska. Gold extraction was slow, because almost no heavy machinery was available to remove the <b>overburden</b> above the layers of gold. The gold discoveries of 1903 reversed the trend of people away from the Tanana Valley. By Christmas 1903, there were between 1,500 and 1,800 miners in the valley. Another food shortage arose {{during the winter of}} 1903, alleviated only by the food Barnette had brought in after his trip to the Lower 48.|$|E
25|$|Strip mining exposes coal by {{removing}} earth above each coal seam. This earth {{is referred to}} as <b>overburden</b> and is removed in long strips. The <b>overburden</b> from the first strip is deposited in an area outside the planned mining area and referred to as out-of-pit dumping. <b>Overburden</b> from subsequent strips are deposited in the void left from mining the coal and <b>overburden</b> from the previous strip. This {{is referred to as}} in-pit dumping.|$|E
25|$|When coal seams {{are near}} the surface, it may be {{economical}} to extract the coal using open cut (also referred to as open cast, open pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Open cast coal mining recovers {{a greater proportion of}} the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which operate by removing the <b>overburden,</b> power shovels, large trucks in which transport <b>overburden</b> and coal, bucket wheel excavators, and conveyors. In this mining method, explosives are first used in order to break through the surface or <b>overburden,</b> of the mining area. The <b>overburden</b> is then removed by draglines or by shovel and truck. Once the coal seam is exposed, it is drilled, fractured and thoroughly mined in strips. The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or directly to where it will be used.|$|E

25|$|In {{a similar}} fashion to streamworking, much use was made of water {{for the removal of}} the <b>overburden</b> and gangue. When digging large gullies the <b>overburden,</b> which {{consisted}} at least partly of decomposed granite ("growan"), was loosened with picks, and then water was used to wash away the unwanted material instead of manhandling it. Means of collecting, diverting and storing water were always associated with openworks. In some cases when only poor sources of water were available complex systems of reservoirs were built.|$|E
25|$|Equipment {{to be used}} {{depends on}} {{geological}} conditions. For example, to remove <b>overburden</b> that is loose or unconsolidated, a bucket wheel excavator {{might be the most}} productive. The life of some area mines may be more than 50 years.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{mining and}} deep {{underground}} mining {{are the two}} basic methods of mining. The choice of mining method depends primarily on depth, density, <b>overburden</b> and thickness of the coal seam; seams relatively close to the surface, at depths less than approximately , are usually surface mined.|$|E

25|$|The {{removal of}} {{vegetative}} cover and activities {{associated with the}} construction of haul roads, stockpiling of topsoil, displacement of <b>overburden</b> and hauling of soil and coal increase the quantity of dust around mining operations.

25|$|Removal of {{soil and}} rock <b>overburden</b> {{covering}} the coal resource may cause burial and loss of topsoil, exposes parent material, and creates large infertile wastelands. Soil disturbance and associated compaction result in conditions conducive to erosion. Soil removal from the area to be surface-mined alters or destroys many natural soil characteristics, and reduces its biodiversity and productivity for agriculture. Soil structure may be disturbed by pulverization or aggregate breakdown.|$|E

This would <b>overburden</b> the state, inconvenience police and witnesses, cause delays in the trial system, and possibly lead to inconsistent verdicts, he continued.|$|E
25|$|The {{limitations}} of contour strip mining are {{both economic and}} technical. When the operation reaches a predetermined stripping ratio (tons of overburden/tons of coal), it is not profitable to continue. Depending on the equipment available, {{it may not be}} technically feasible to exceed a certain height of highwall. At this point, it is possible to produce more coal with the augering method in which spiral drills bore tunnels into a highwall laterally from the bench to extract coal without removing the <b>overburden.</b>|$|E

Coke from coal is grey, hard, and porous and has a heating value of 24.8 million Btu/ton (29.6 MJ/kg). Some cokemaking processes produce valuable byproducts, including coal tar, ammonia, light oils, and coal gas.|$|E
