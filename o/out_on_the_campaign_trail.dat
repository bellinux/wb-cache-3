[...] In response, Trump withheld $1.5 million in alimony he owed Maples, claiming she was in violation of the confidentiality agreement in the couple's divorce decree. [...] After a Manhattan judge refused to hear the matter, a brief conference was held, wherein the judge's law secretary advised Trump to pay the alimony and advised Maples that further incidents would be cause for the judge to reconsider hearing the matter. [...] Trump's attorneys were satisfied that the meeting would cause Maples to rethink making any public statements on her marriage to Trump.|$|E

50|$|In Jan 544, Lý Bôn proclaimed himself {{emperor and}} named the country Vạn Xuân, ending the Second Chinese {{domination}} of Vietnam. In winter 544, Xiao Ying died, and initially, Chen started escorting Xiao Ying's casket back to Jiankang for burial. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> way, {{while he was}} still at Dayu Mountain (大庾嶺, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> borders of modern Jiangxi and Guangdong), he was ordered to rendezvous with the new governor of Giao Châu Province, Yang Piao (楊瞟), and another nephew of Emperor Wu's, Xiao Bo (蕭勃), to attack Lý Bôn. Xiao Bao did not want to set <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> and therefore try to persuade Yang not to advance. Chen persuaded Yang otherwise, and in spring 545, Yang, with Chen as his lieutenant, attacked Lý Bôn, defeating him and forcing him flee into the mountains and conduct guerilla warfare instead. In 548, Lý Bôn's subordinates killed Lý Bôn, and when Lý Bôn's brother Lý Thiên Bảo succeeded him and attacked Ai Province (愛州, centering modern Thanh Hóa Province, Vietnam), Chen defeated Lý Thiên Bảo. Emperor Wu made Chen the governor of Gaoyao Commandery (高要, roughly modern Zhaoqing, Guangdong) as well as the commander of the forces of the surrounding commanderies.|$|R

50|$|Reverting to the 19th century custom that presidents seeking {{re-election}} did not campaign, Taft {{retreated to}} the golf links. He spoke publicly only once, when making his nomination acceptance speech on August 1. He had difficulty in financing the campaign, as many industrialists had concluded he could not win, and would support Wilson to block Roosevelt. The president issued a confident statement in September after the Republicans narrowly won Vermont's state elections in a three-way fight, but had no illusions he would win his race. He had hoped to send his cabinet officers <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>trail,</b> but found them reluctant to go. Senator Root agreed to give a single speech for him. Any remaining sense of optimism within the campaign evaporated when Vice President Sherman became seriously ill in October, and died six days before the election. It wasn't until January (two months after the election) that the Republican National Committee named Columbia University president Nicholas Murray Butler to replace Sherman and to receive his electoral votes.|$|E
25|$|The Premiership was a reclusive office {{prior to}} 1832.

He never went <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stump to <b>campaign,</b> even during elections; he rarely spoke directly to ordinary voters about policies and issues.|$|R
50|$|Later in 685, Empress Dowager Wu {{commissioned}} Wei to lead an army {{to defend}} against an Eastern Tujue attack—a campaign that lasted until spring 686. In summer 686, she made him Wenchang You Xiang (文昌右相) -- one of {{the heads of the}} executive bureau of government (文昌臺, Wenchang Tai). It was said that Wei felt that his promotions were undeserved and was not feeling comfortable about them, and therefore repeatedly offered to resign, but Empress Dowager Wu repeatedly declined. He also requested that some of his titles be removed and that his father Wei Ting, who had died late in Emperor Taizong's reign in exile, be posthumously honored, and therefore she posthumously honored Wei Ting as the prefect of Run Prefecture (潤州, roughly modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu). In 689, Wei Daijia requested that he be put back into command of an army, and so Empress Dowager Wu commissioned him to attack Tufan, commanding 36 generals; she also created him the Duke of Fuyang. He set <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> and encountered Tufan forces at Yinshijia River (寅識迦河, flowing through Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang). He enjoyed some initial success, but was eventually defeated by Tufan forces. Further, it was cold and the food supplies were low, causing many deaths due to cold and hunger; this forced him to withdraw to Gaochang. Empress Dowager Wu was incensed, and she executed Wei's deputy Yan Wengu (閻溫古) for having hesitated during <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> while exiling Wei to Xiu Prefecture (繡州, roughly modern Guigang, Guangxi). He died in exile soon thereafter.|$|R
50|$|Abdul, seking {{to work in}} government, goes to Adoli Awal the Teboke Member of Parliament, for help.

Abdul is released and contests for the parliamentary seat. The clashes that break <b>out</b> <b>on</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> rallies leave some people hurt and others dead. The book seeks to find the candidate who will become Teboke’s next MP.|$|R
5000|$|Macmillan faced {{criticism}} when it placed adverts in Facebook and <b>on</b> Google associating <b>the</b> viral {{fund raising}} activity, the Ice Bucket Challenge with itself. It had {{been suggested that}} the aim of <b>the</b> Macmillan marketing <b>campaign</b> was to divert web traffic and subsequently awareness and donations away from smaller charities with whom the challenge had been mostly associated, namely those relating to Motor Neuron Disease and ALS. Amanda Neylon, the head of digital at Macmillan, said the charity got behind the Ice Bucket Challenge, which asks participants to pour a bucket of iced water on their heads, because it was criticised for being too slow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> uptake for the #nomakeupselfie social media <b>campaign.</b> <b>On</b> missing <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> #nomakeupselfie <b>campaign,</b> Neylon said: [...] "We were too slow - {{it was a big}} motivator to be much better the next time an opportunity came along." ...|$|R
25|$|Grant's army set <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Overland <b>Campaign</b> with <b>the</b> goal {{of drawing}} Lee into {{a defense of}} Richmond, where they would attempt to pin down and destroy the Confederate army. The Union army first {{attempted}} to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles, notably at the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor. These battles resulted in heavy losses on both sides, and forced Lee's Confederates to fall back repeatedly. An attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the Bermuda Hundred river bend. Each battle resulted in setbacks for the Union that mirrored what they had suffered under prior generals, though unlike those prior generals, Grant fought on rather than retreat. Grant was tenacious and kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. While Lee was preparing for an attack on Richmond, Grant unexpectedly turned south to cross the James River and began the protracted Siege of Petersburg, where the two armies engaged in trench warfare for over nine months.|$|R
50|$|The {{agreement}} was sealed with a dinner between Charles and Sigismund <b>on</b> Linköping Castle. <b>The</b> King, who was under pressure, fearing {{for his life}} without his army and having realised {{that he had lost}} the political battle, fled during the coming days to Poland in late 1598.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the preliminary results of two recent excavations {{held at the}} Early Neolithic site of Portonovo - Fosso Fontanaccia <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Conero promontory in the Marche. Here 16 domed ovens were found cut into the hillslope, {{one of which was}} intact. Two of the ovens contain three burials, while the remains of a cremated female were found in an open area, carefully collected in a container of organic material which was not preserved. Oven batteries dug into the ground are known in many sites of Central Europe, from France to Slovakia, from the Early Neolithic onwards. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, in Italy the documentation for domed ovens is restricted to a few, poorly preserved specimens. This article focuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main features of the structures and burials, while pottery and lithics are currently under study. Micromorphological, archaeozoological and palaeobotanical analyses are in progress. The appendices contain the anthropological study of human remains, the bone collagen stable isotope analysis, the preliminary results of the anthracological study and analysis of the temperatures reached in the ovens. Sampling for an archeomagnetical analysis of the three structures discovered in 2012 and not yet excavated will be carried <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next <b>campaign...</b>|$|R
40|$|Since the {{construction}} of the first Petawatt laser <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Nova laser facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory we are witnessing the emergence of similar Petawatt-class laser systems at laboratories all around the world. This new generation of lasers, able to deliver several hundred joules of energy in a sub-picosecond pulse, has enabled a host of new discoveries to be made and continues to provide a valuable tool to explore new regimes in relativistic laser-plasma physics [...] encompassing high energy X-rays and -rays, relativistic electrons, intense ion beams, and superstrong magnetic fields. The coupling in the near-future of multi-kiloJoule Petawatt-class lasers with large-scale fusion lasers. including the NIF and Omega EP (US), LIL (France), and FIREX (Japan) [...] will further expand opportunities in fast ignition, high energy X-ray radiography, and high energy density physics research. The 500 J Petawatt laser at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory is currently the highest energy short-pulse laser in the world. In this paper we describe a recent experimental <b>campaign</b> carried <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> facility. <b>The</b> <b>campaign,</b> performed by a large collaborative team from eight different laboratories, was designed to study a variety of relativistic laser-interaction phenomena including laser absorption, fast electron transport, proton heating, and high-brightness x-ray generation. The wide scope of the experiment necessitated the deployment of a very large set of diagnostics [...] in total twenty-five separate instruments. In order to obtain the most comprehensive set of measurements all twenty-five diagnostics were fielded simultaneously on every shot...|$|R
25|$|The {{morning of}} 25 September 1598 the armies clashed {{in a major}} {{engagement}} at the Battle of Stångebro. Charles offered talks again but attacked in a mist while Sigismund's men were withdrawing to their camp, which resulted in only the mercenaries fighting since his Swedes refused to fight. Duke Charles won a decisive victory that forced Sigismund to agree to harsh terms. Charles demanded that the King send home his entire army but that he himself was to stay and await a Parliament. Also, a number of Swedes who had sided with Sigismund, including his Council supporters, were captured. These were later executed in the Linköping Bloodbath of 1600. The peace agreement was sealed with a dinner between Charles and Sigismund at Linköping Castle. The King, who was under pressure, fearing for his life without his army and having realised {{that he had lost}} the political battle, fled during the coming days to Poland in late 1598.
