5|$|An angry Shekhar {{comes back}} home to play a {{favourite}} tune from the past on his piano. The flashback shows a young Shekhar playing Rabindranath Tagore’s tune on his piano while young Lalita and Koel are around. Lalita, with her parents having {{died in a car}} accident, lives with Gurcharan’s family. Koel is her cousin whereas Charu is her neighbour. As this scene flashes across Shekhar’s mind, he sings a song full <b>of</b> <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> loss. As time flies, they grow up to become close friends. The rebellious and musically inclined Shekhar spends his days playing the music of Rabindranath Tagore or Elvis Presley and composing his own songs with Lalita rather than becoming part of his shrewd father's business. Part of this rebellion involves resistance to meeting Gayatri Tantiya, the beautiful but devious daughter of a wealthy industrialist, whom his father would like Shekhar to marry. Meanwhile, Girish, a steel tycoon from London, makes a dramatic entry into Charu’s house. Girish seems smitten by Lalita while Koel is by Girish. Shekhar is visibly jealous of Lolita’s close friendship with Girish.|$|E
5|$|In the meanwhile, her father's {{fishing boat}} is {{taken away by}} creditors. He sinks into a state <b>of</b> <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> begins to drink away their savings. On one occasion, Vanaja’s {{superior}} intellect pits her against Shekhar in a public incident which ultimately humiliates {{him in front of}} his mother. Matters escalate, and one day Vanaja is raped by Shekhar. She eventually loses her job when she becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a boy, much against Rama Devi’s wishes who would have liked her to abort the foetus. Vanaja hopes that the physical evidence of the child will be proof of the rape and that somehow Shekhar will be brought to justice. However, Shekhar has no desire to marry Vanaja because she is from a lower caste. In the end Rama Devi and Shekhar gain possession of the child, who will grow up to be an upper caste boy.|$|E
5|$|Fei {{sets out}} to destroy Deus and free the Wave Existence and Elly. In Merkaba, the party defeats Deus, but they realize that the energy {{released}} from the Wave Existence's shift will destroy the planet. Elly, inside Deus, tries to move {{it away from the}} planet and Fei, in his Xenogears, follows to save her, but both disappear in the rift. Krelian confronts them, telling Fei he only sought to end the pain and suffering that comes with human existence by reverting everything back to when it all began, when all was one, to ascend to the realm of God. Fei rejects Krelian's ideology with his love for Elly, but Krelian challenges Fei, telling him to prove this love that could make him independent of God, and calls forth Urobolus, a gigantic serpent-like incarnation of Miang. Xenogears appears and Fei uses it to defeat Urobolus. Krelian releases Elly and reveals to Fei that he had planned to become one with God along with Elly. During her time with Krelian, Elly had seen inside his heart and realized it was full <b>of</b> <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> despair for all the atrocities he had committed. Despite everything, Elly says that Krelian truly loved people more than anyone else. Because no one will forgive his sins, he declines Fei's offer to return and ascends to a higher plain of existence along with the Wave Existence, telling Fei and Elly that he envies them. Fei and Elly then return to their planet along with Xenogears and reunite {{with the rest of the}} party.|$|E

25|$|More recent {{research}} {{found that in}} a sample of mothers who had released their children for adoption four to 12 years prior, every participant had frequent thoughts of their lost child. For most, thoughts were both negative and positive in that they produced both feelings <b>of</b> <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> joy. Those who experienced the greatest portion of positive thoughts were those who had open, rather than closed or time-limited mediated adoptions.|$|E
25|$|When Margery {{was seven}} years old, her father died suddenly, a life-changing event which, {{in one way or}} another, would affect all of her future {{creative}} activity. The undertone <b>of</b> <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> the themes of death and loss that flow through her children's books have been criticised by some reviewers, but Williams always maintained that hearts acquire greater humanity through pain and adversity. She wrote that life is a process of constant change—there are departures for some and arrivals for others—and the process allows us to grow and persevere.|$|E

25|$|In 211, Cao Cao {{embarked}} on a campaign to attack a coalition of northwestern warlords led by Ma Chao and Han Sui, leading to the Battle of Tong Pass and the subsequent battles. Cao Cao's wife Lady Bian followed her husband and stayed at Meng Ford (孟津; present-day Mengjin County, Henan), while Cao Pi remained in Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei). Lady Bian fell ill during that time. Lady Zhen became worried when she heard about it and she cried day and night. She constantly sent messengers to inquire her mother-in-law's condition, but refused to believe them when they reported that Lady Bian was getting better, and she became filled with greater anxiety. Lady Bian later {{wrote a letter to}} her, telling her that she had fully recovered, and only then did Lady Zhen's worries disappear. About a year later, when Lady Bian returned to Ye, Lady Zhen rushed to see her mother-in-law and displayed mixed expressions <b>of</b> <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> joy. Those who were present were all deeply moved by the scene before them. Lady Bian assured Lady Zhen that her illness was not serious and praised her for her filial piety.|$|E
500|$|Although it is {{much less}} popular than Dvořák's other symphonic poems, A Hero's Song has been {{described}} as [...] "an uninhibited outpouring of joyous energy" [...] and [...] "musically as rich as its siblings written one year earlier", while its lacrimosa section is [...] "full <b>of</b> <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> longing." [...] Its character {{has been described as}} [...] "a variation on Beethoven's style," [...] Mahler's slight influence has been noted in the funeral march, and the ending has been compared to the patriotic music of Edward Elgar.|$|E
500|$|The game's world {{design and}} {{atmosphere}} received great critical reviews. Many critics {{agreed that the}} game had successfully built up tension through the game's conversations between characters and the resource management mechanics, which enables players to feel threatened {{by the state of}} the world. The world was thought to be more [...] "alive" [...] than its predecessor, and critics praised the development team for creating distinct locations, and turning typical gritty colors featured in many games into something refreshing and stunning. The depiction of the world and 4A's vision of an apocalypse was applauded for delivering a sense <b>of</b> <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> desperation. The game's attention to detail was widely praised, and the surface area, in particular, was applauded. Critics thought that these sequences offered visual variety, and some [...] "genuine terror" [...] moments. Jim Sterling from Destructoid singled out the game's multiple flashback scenes, which he described as [...] "harrowing".|$|E

500|$|Debussy {{was known}} for his meticulousness in the {{arrangement}} of his preludes. [...] Pianist and musical writer Paul Roberts asserts that this prelude, along with the two that immediately precede it, forms [...] "the central arch" [...] of Book I's structure, since the three pieces provide the most [...] "dramatic contrast" [...] out of all the preludes in the first book. [...] The sixth prelude, Des pas sur la neige (Footprints in the Snow), evokes a feeling <b>of</b> <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> isolation, while Ce qu'a vu le vent d'ouest (What the West wind saw)—the seventh—exudes a violent and tumultuous nature. [...] In stark contrast to these two, La fille brings about a sense of gentle [...] "lyricism" [...] and [...] "warmth", which is uncharacteristic of Debussy's music of this kind. [...] By placing these three preludes in this particular order, Debussy ensured that arguably the most technically challenging prelude of the collection (Vent d'ouest) was situated in-between the two that are the simplest to play out of the twenty-four.|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} divided into 21 chapters, with each chapter {{switching}} between the points-of-view of the supervillain Dr. Impossible and the superhero Fatale. The narrative is written in the first person, like a memoir, describing the inner monologues of the two protagonists. The dual narrative foils and [...] "blur the distinction" [...] between the superheroes and the supervillain. The language was described as having a [...] "sincere tone of glory" [...] and [...] "boyish indulgence" [...] with [...] "an undercurrent <b>of</b> <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> a surprisingly human universality". While the story uses standard comic book story elements, like superheroes fighting supervillains, the book is written entirely in prose. The story combines a satire of superhero archetypes and comic book clichés, {{such as the use}} of many superlatives, with realist elements that portray the sometimes mundane lives and everyday challenges of its characters, like coping with cybernetic body parts that weigh far more than a natural body and that react before the brain registers what is happening. Common social situations and psychological issues, like loneliness and trying to connect with a group, are also portrayed. Reviewers identified numerous themes, such as power, greed, fame, ego, loneliness, belonging, and identity.|$|E
500|$|Other {{tracks were}} noted for their retro stylization. [...] "Rather Die Young" [...] is {{a throwback to}} 1960s doo-wop and Philadelphia soul, with a slow tempo and modern drums. [...] "Party" [...] {{achieves}} a vintage aesthetic through minimalistic production, replete with heavy synthesizers and a 1980s smooth-funk groove. The song is unique for its conversation-like structure, in which Beyoncé and guest-vocalist André 3000 sing verses that allude to socialization at parties. Elements of Prince's style was found on [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] and [...] "I Care". [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] is an uptempo funk song, with lyrics that advise the listener to live life to the fullest while cautioning them {{about the consequences of}} excess. The chorus of [...] "I Care" [...] was compared to [...] "Purple Rain", with themes <b>of</b> <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> resentment, the song uses soft background vocals and dense percussion. [...] "Love on Top" [...] was noted for its energetic key changes with a joyful tone, evoking the work of Michael and Janet Jackson. Its retro sound is marked by a melding of horns as well as sweet backing harmonies that are most prominent on its bridge and chorus.|$|E
25|$|Du Bellay's {{greatest}} poems {{were written}} during his long stay in Rome; his {{discovery of the}} ruined city, dismay at {{the corruption of the}} Papal court and loneliness gave rise to a sonnet cycle <b>of</b> remarkable <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> severity (partially inspired by Ovid's Tristia).|$|R

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{wrote that}} {{watching}} it left him [...] "reeling with turmoil and confusion, with feelings <b>of</b> <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> despair," [...] {{and called it}} a [...] "thoroughly painful and depressing experience - but, it must be said, {{one that has been}} powerfully written, directed and acted." [...] He awarded the film three and a half out of a possible four stars. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that this [...] "slick, riveting, viscerally scary film about what in other hands would be a decidedly unsalable subject, namely death," [...] is [...] "both quaint and devastating." [...] However, Desson Thomson of The Washington Post felt disappointed with the film that is [...] "ultimately flat on its surrealistic face, the victim of too many fake-art sequences." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Jacob's Ladder is so 'dark' it sucks Robbins right down with it. By the time Jacob is being strapped to a bed and wheeled down a hospital corridor strewn with bloody limbs, it's hard to care whether the Orwellian image is a hallucination or not. You just want out." [...] Kim Newman called the film [...] "effectively the blunt remake" [...] of Carnival of Souls.|$|E
