40|$|Excerpt] The strikes narrated in {{this paper}} have {{illustrated}} {{different ways in which}} individuals 2 ̆ 7 recognition of ethnic identity could interact with their recognition of gender and class identities. In each strike workers 2 ̆ 7 identities developed along with the serial narrative of the particular strike situation. The use of Sartre 2 ̆ 7 s concept of the series helps us think about the many possible variations of class, ethnicity, and gender. Though Sartre planned to use his concept of series as a way to examine peoples 2 ̆ 7 class identities, my employment of the concept broadens it to include other categories of identification as well. Using the concept this broadly highlights the importance of three key issues: historical narrative, historical materialism, and the agency of individuals and groups within both of those. In each of the strikes retold here, individuals act out of identities formed by both specific material circumstances and specific events. By thinking of these identities as representative of memberships in different series we keep alive the possibilities of change inherent in individuals 2 ̆ 7 lives. Each individual has at her disposal an array of experiences from which she can and must construct her own responses to the events in which she finds herself. Thinking of these experiences as the formative materials of membership in different series aids the historian in thinking about class, gender, ethnicity, race, and other categories less as one-time choices of identity made by individuals and more as part of an array of choices <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>individuals</b> act...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Audiovisual Storytelling and Ideological Horizons: Audiences, Cultural Contexts and Extra-textual Meaning Making In {{a society}} {{characterized}} by mediatization people are to an increasing degree dependent on mediated narratives {{as a primary}} means by which we make sense of our experience through time and our place in society (Hoover 2006, Lynch 2007, Hjarvard 2008, Hjarvard & Lövheim 2012). American media scholar Stewart Hoover points to symbols and scripts available in the media environment, what he call the “symbolic inventory” <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>individuals</b> make religious or spiritual meaning (Hoover 2006 : 55). Vernacular meaning-making embedded in everyday life among viewers’ dealing with fiction narratives in films and tv-series highlight {{a need for a}} more nuanced understanding of complex audiovisual storytelling. Moving images provide individuals with stories by which reality is maintained and by which humans construct ordered micro-universes for themselves using film as a resource for moral assessment and ideological judgments about life (Plantinga 2009, Johnston 2010, Axelson 2015). Important in this theoretical context are perspectives on viewers’ moral frameworks (Zillman 2005, Andersson & Andersson 2005, Frampton 2006, Avila 2007). This paper presentation will focus on ideological contested meaning making where audiences of different cultural background engage emotionally with filmic narratives, possibly eliciting ideological and spiritual meaning-making related to viewers’ personal world views. Through the example of the Homeland tv-series I want to discuss how spectators’ cultural, religious, political and ideological identities could be understood playing a role in the interpretative process of decoding content. Is it possible to trace patterns of different receptions of the multilayered and ambiguous story depicted in Homeland by religiously engaged Christians and Moslems as well as non-believers, in America, Europe and Middle East? How is the fiction narrative dealt with by spectators in the audience in different cultural contexts and how is it interpreted through the process of extra-text evaluation and real world 2 understanding in a global era preoccupied with war on terror? The presentation will also discuss methodological considerations about how to reach out to audiences anchored in different cultural context. Multimodalitet Interkulturalitet Menin...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} the concept of self, specifically I seek {{to answer the question}} of what constitutes the self. To deal conceptually and theoretically with the concept of self is to consider what the nature of self is, how the self develops, and under what conditions. I explore the dialectical relationship between self and society at three levels, the complexity of social structure and its influence upon the formation of the self, the relationship between the self and the 2 ̆ 2 generalized other, 2 ̆ 2 and the relationship between the 2 ̆ 2 I 2 ̆ 2 and the 2 ̆ 2 me. 2 ̆ 2 ^ The goal of the dissertation is a synthesis of theories of self which includes both a micro and a macro perspective. The model of self is based on Markus and Katayama 2 ̆ 7 s (1994) Enculturation Model, modified extensively to include macro components. The model has four levels, moving from the social structure to the individual: collective reality, socio-psychological processes, local worlds, and habitual psychological tendencies. Part one and part two review symbolic interactionist theorists and structural Marxist theorists, respectively. Part three elaborates the model of self by plugging into the four levels each theorist, where appropriate. ^ Marx 2 ̆ 7 s base/superstructure conceptualization of social structure, Althusser 2 ̆ 7 s materialist dialectic, and Mead 2 ̆ 7 s conceptualization of mind are used to deal with collective reality. Althusser 2 ̆ 7 s concept of 2 ̆ 2 interpellation 2 ̆ 2 is used to link the core ideologies associated with collective reality to socio-psychological practices occurring in the institutions of social structure. Stryker 2 ̆ 7 s identity theory is used to connect social structure to the interaction networks in the local world, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>individuals</b> construct and identity and self. Lastly, all the theorists are brought together and their theories synthesized in the section dealing with habitual psychological tendencies. ...|$|E

Boas's empirical field research, however, led him to argue against this comparison. For example, his 1903 essay, [...] "Decorative Designs of Alaskan Needlecases: A History of Conventional Designs, Based on Materials in a U.S.Museum", provides another example of how Boas made broad theoretical claims based on {{a detailed analysis of}} empirical data. After establishing formal similarities among the needlecases, Boas shows how certain formal features provide a vocabulary <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>individual</b> artisans could create variations in design. Thus, his emphasis on culture as a context for meaningful action made him sensitive to individual variation within a society (William Henry Holmes suggested a similar point in an 1886 paper, [...] "Origin and development of form and ornament in ceramic art", although unlike Boas he did not develop the ethnographic and theoretical implications).|$|R

The computed bond lengths depend on the rate of rupture, and show some scatter due to the nonequilibrium nature of the experiment. On average, the bond length increases from ∼ 1. 7 nm to 2. 3 nm as the rates go down. Conformational analyses elucidate the detailed mechanism of lipid-membrane bond rupture.

40|$|One of {{the reasons}} for using {{variability}} in the software product line (SPL) approach (see Apel et al., 2006; Figueiredo et al., 2008; Kastner et al., 2007; Mezini & Ostermann, 2004) is to delay a design decision (Svahnberg et al., 2005). Instead of deciding on what system to develop in advance, with the SPL approach a set of components and a reference architecture are specified and implemented (during domain engineering, see Czarnecki & Eisenecker, 2000) <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>individual</b> systems are composed at a later stage (during application engineering, see Czarnecki & Eisenecker, 2000). By postponing the design decisions in such a manner, it is possible to better fit the resultant system in its intended environment, for instance, to allow selection of the system interaction mode to be made after the customers have purchased particular hardware, such as a PDA vs. a laptop. Such variability is expressed through variation points which are locations in a software-based system where choices are available for defining a specific instance of a system (Svahnberg et al., 2005). Until recently it had sufficed to postpone committing to a specific system instance till before the system runtime. However, in the recent years the use and expectations of software systems in human society has undergone significant changes. Today's software systems need to be always available, highly interactive, and able to continuously adapt according to the varying environment conditions, user characteristics and characteristics of other systems that interact with them. Such systems, called adaptive systems, are expected to be long-lived and able to undertake adaptations with little or no human intervention (Cheng et al., 2009). Therefore, the variability now needs to be present also at system runtime, which leads to {{the emergence of a new}} type of system: adaptive systems with dynamic variability...|$|R

40|$|Observations {{indicate}} that massive stars form in regions {{of very high}} surface density, ~ 1 g cm^ 2. Clusters containing massive stars and globular clusters have a comparable column density. The gas pressure in clouds of such a column density is P/k~ 10 ^ 8 - 10 ^ 9 K cm^ 3, far greater than that in the diffuse interstellar medium or the average in giant molecular clouds. Observations show that massive star-forming regions are supersonically turbulent, and we show that the molecular cores <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>individual</b> massive stars form are as well. The protostellar accretion rate in such a core is approximately equal to the instantaneous stellar mass divided by the free-fall time of gas accreting onto the star (Stahler, Shu, & Taam 1980). The star-formation time in this Turbulent Core model for massive star formation is several mean free-fall timescales of the core, but is about {{equal to that of}} the region in which the core is embedded. The typical time for a massive star to form is about 10 ^ 5 yr and the accretion rate is high enough to overcome radiation pressure due to the luminosity of the star. For the typical case we consider, in <b>which</b> the cores <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> the stars form have a density structure varying as r^{- 1. 5 }, the protostellar accretion rate grows linearly with time. We calculate the evolution of the radius of a protostar and determine the accretion luminosity. At the high accretion rates typical of regions of massive star formation, protostars join the main sequence at about 20 solar masses. We apply these results to predict the properties of protostars thought to be powering several observed hot molecular cores, including the Orion hot core and W 3 (H 2 O).

Milieus have their own interests that lead them not just to interact with, but oftentimes to criticise and sometimes even confront their violent offshoots.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I will propose a new {{approach}} to certain semantic puzzles due to Frege, Kripke and others, and the question of propositional attitudes, via the notion of belief revision. The principal logical tool used for setting up the solution is the notion an individual theory. I shall suppose that each individual has his or her own theory consisting of the sentences the individual accepts. It is this theory, which together with the individual’s preferences leads to a choice of some actions over others; it is this theory <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> the <b>individual</b> communicates; and it is this theory which is revised when a communication, {{in the form of a}} sentence uttered by another, is heard or otherwise received. The theory may also be revised as a result of an experience with the “world ” as might happen when someone without an umbrella gets wet and adds “It is raining ” to his theory. There is also a community theory Tc <b>which</b> consists <b>of</b> sentences <b>which</b> we all accept and which, in the varous puzzles, has a different notion of possibility from that of the individual’s theory. Thus there is conflict between these two theories not only about what is true or what is known, but even about what is possible. It turns <b>out</b> that most <b>of</b> the puzzles considered in the literature are puzzles about reconciling these two theories. A crucial aspect of this way of looking at the puzzles is that the central role of truth conditions as the determinants of meaning is rejected and more flexible, purely syntactic tools are used. It will be argued that the truth theoretic view of meaning is not an adquate tool for semantics, and abandoning it makes the problems much more amenable. This need not imply abandoning truth, but merely dethroning it from its central role as a foundation for semantics...|$|R

Shape of the New takes up a vast territory of texts, institutions, speeches, events, and much more. Writing in the New York Times Book Review, Fareed Zakaria stated They have to cover an immense range of material, from economics to evolution to Islamic fundamentalism. But they do so comprehensively, intelligently and with nuance and judiciousness. I was struck again and again by the extraordinary breadth, erudition and lucidity of this book. Briefly put, the book examines four major domains of thought via fundamental thinkers: Adam Smith in economic freedom; Darwin in biology; Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton in democratic government; and Karl Marx in human equality. The treatment includes tracing the history of how these expanded in influence through the 19th and 20th century, examining their diverse impacts up to the present time. The authors' key point is that ideas like democratic freedom and economic liberty are no less alive and fought over today than 200 years ago, and this will not stop. Needless to say, this is no less true for Darwin and for Marx. As Zakaria notes, [...] "For almost a century, hundreds of millions studied Marx's work as gospel. Powerful nations like the Soviet Union and Maoist China organized themselves around his theories. In most other societies, politics were defined and organized in opposition to his views." ...|$|R
40|$|Poster {{presented}} at the Fifth International Symposium on Genetics in Aquaculture, June 19 â€“ 25, 1994, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Adult Oreochromis niloticus were mass spawned in concrete tanks. The one-month old progenies (F 1) were exposed for two months to a mixture of 0. 01 mg L âˆ’ 1 Hg, 0. 1 mg L âˆ’ 1 Cd and 1. 0 mg L âˆ’ 1 Zn. The survivors were grown to sexual maturity in a natural environment (lake). The fish were spawned and the progenies (F 2) of the exposed F 1 (EF 1) were exposed to another mixture of the three metals: 3. 0 mg L âˆ’ 1 Zn, 0. 30 mg L âˆ’ 1 Cd and 0. 01 mg L âˆ’ 1 Hg, both in a static and static-renewal system. Another group of F 2 from unexposed F 1 (UF 1) received the same treatment. Results showed that in both exposure systems, survival of the F 2 of EF 1 was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than those from UF 1. The medial lethal time (LT 50) of the F 2 's were estimated from the time-response curve following regression analysis: 5. 16 days (F 2 of UF 1) and 9. 03 days (F 2 of EF 1) in the static exposure experiment; 3. 34 days (F 2 of UF 1) and 5. 52 days (F 2 of EF 1) in the static-renewal run. Exposure of the parental stock resulted in the culling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>which</b> were more susceptible to the heavy metals. The more resistant members of the population (survivors) which {{have the ability to}} adapt to the toxicants were able to pass on the resistance to their offspring. The results are supported by other studies in the field which demonstrate high resistance in populations of organisms living in contaminated sites...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough it's {{known that}} {{communication}} started with human existence, its becoming a scientific discipline coincide with early 20 th century. Because mass media became common {{in these years}} and made its presence felt especially via press during World War One. The need of researching the effect of mass media has a great share in communication to become a discipline. The years between 1920 - 1940, {{as well as its}} problematical sides, are known as “strong effect” period. Even such similes like “hypodermic needle” or “magic bullet” were used for this period. Nevertheless, after understanding that the effect is not strong as predicted with a research performed during 1940 presidential election in USA, “limited effect” period started in communication science history. The next process belonged to a period which shaped around the idea that audience is active and central. “Adoption of innovation model”, discussed in this study, is one of the theories that showed up in this period. Communication scientist Everett Rogers firstly presented this model in his book named “Diffusion of Innovations”, published in 1962. The theory is predicated on the fact that “mass media has a significant effect on diffusion of innovations through society, however this effect is not so strong and it's important to figure <b>out</b> <b>which</b> <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> impact, presence of social conditions and mass media has the biggest effect”. Besides, by means of the development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), it's also a fact that we are transforming into networked information societies. Within this scope, the aim of this study is researching impacts to readiness levels of countries in the areas of social and economic issues, individual and business usage and digital content of decision making factors presented in the context of Diffusion of Innovations Theory and trying to comment the gained statistical results...|$|R
