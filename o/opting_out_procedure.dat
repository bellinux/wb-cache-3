40|$|When {{firms can}} {{identify}} their past customers, they may use information about purchase histories {{in order to}} price discriminate. We present a model with a monopolist and a continuum of heterogeneous consumers, where consumers can <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> from being identified, possibly at a cost. We find that when consumers can costlessly <b>opt</b> <b>out,</b> they all individually choose privacy, which results in the highest profit for the monopolist. In fact, all consumers are better off when <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> is costly. When valuations are uniformly distributed, social surplus is non-monotonic {{in the cost of}} <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> and is highest when <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> is prohibitively costly. We introduce the notion of a privacy gatekeeper - a third party that is able to act as a privacy conduit and set the cost of <b>opting</b> <b>out.</b> We prove that the privacy gatekeeper only charges the firm in equilibrium, making privacy costless to consumers...|$|R

40|$|This paper compares {{two general}} methods of {{privatization}} social security: forced {{participation in the}} new privatized system vs. letting people choose between the new system or staying in social security (i. e., <b>opting</b> <b>out).</b> Simulations are performed using a large scale perfect-foresight OLG simulation model that incorporates both intra-generational and inter-generational heterogeneity. The decision of any agent to <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> is endogenous and depends on the <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> decisions of all other agents vis-…-vis factor prices. Various tax bases are considered in financing the transition path, {{as well as the}} perceived tax-benefit linkage due to the informational problems inherent in many social security systems. We consider two cases: full and no perception Both methods of privatizing social security lead to large long- run gains for all lifetime income classes despite the intra-generational progressivity of social security, but differ in their short run effects due to adverse selection associated with <b>opting</b> <b>out.</b> Adverse selection is a key reason why many economists oppose <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> and why many plans to privatize social security systems mandate participation. This paper, however, shows this wisdom to be wide of the mark. <b>Opting</b> <b>out</b> is better at protecting the welfare of the initial elderly, even though forced participation protects their real value of social security benefits because <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> continues to collect payroll tax revenue from those who stay with social security. <b>Opting</b> <b>out</b> can mean quicker transition paths by reducing social security wealth faster than forced participation, because many will forfeit their accrued claims as the price of <b>opting</b> <b>out.</b> Yet <b>opting</b> <b>out,</b> along with a decrease in the payroll tax rate is better at shifting the burden to future workers who benefit from privatization. ...|$|R

Hand-collected data show that 80 % of cross-listed firms <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> {{of at least one}} exchange governance rule. Relative to firms that comply, firms that <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> have a smaller share of independent directors. Cross-listed firms <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> more when coming from countries with weak corporate governance rules, but if firms based in such countries are growing and have a need for external finance, {{they are more likely to}} comply. <b>Opting</b> <b>out</b> also substantially affects the value of cash holdings. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract One new {{development}} in the ongoing creationism/ evolution controversy has been the proposal to institute opt-out policies that would allow creationist parents to exempt their children from any instruction involving evolution. By way of an explanation {{of some of the}} philosophical issues at play in the debate over evolution and the nature of science, this article shows the educational folly of such policies. If evolution is taught properly, it should not be possible to <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> of it without <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> of biology. Moreover, if Intelligent Design creationist criticisms of evolution and scientific naturalism were taken as the basis for <b>opting</b> <b>out,</b> then the effect would be even more radical and would require <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> of science entirely...|$|R

We use representative survey data from the Spanish Institute of Sociological Research for the Basque Country. To adjust our empirical specification to the prevalent hypothesis we employ a recursive seemingly unrelated probit approach. Our results suggest evidence for a simultaneous and endogenous influence of national identity on political preferences for the <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> of the Basque Country from Spain.

40|$|In {{evolutionary}} {{game theory}} interactions between individuals are often assumed obligatory. However, in many real-life situations, individuals can decide to <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> of an interaction {{depending on the}} information they have about the opponent. We consider a simple evolutionary game theoretic model to study such a scenario, where at each encounter between two individuals the type of the opponent (cooperator/defector) is known with some probability, and where each individual either accepts or <b>opts</b> <b>out</b> of the interaction. If the type of the opponent is unknown, a trustful individual accepts the interaction, whereas a suspicious individual <b>opts</b> <b>out</b> of the interaction. If {{either of the two}} individuals <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> both individuals remain without an interaction. We show that in the prisoners dilemma optional interactions along with suspicious behaviour facilitates the emergence of trustful cooperation...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we analyse the employers' {{decision}} to <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> {{of the public}} disability insurance (DI) system. For the empirical analysis we use an extensive panel of Dutch employers for the period 2000 - 2002. We find that cross-subsidies employers pay or receive under the current public insurance system of experience rating contribute to the <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> decision. Since cross-subsidies are risk related, this is an indication {{for the presence of}} adverse selection: high risk (cross-subsidised) firms tend to remain publicly insured, while low risk (cross subsidising) firms tend to <b>opt</b> <b>out.</b> This finding is supported by the fact that risk related characteristics such as the sector of industry and the composition of the work force by age and gender contribute to the explanation of the opting-out decision. Adverse selection could be diminished by setting public premiums {{in such a way that}} they are more actuarial fair in the long run. As a result, the risk profile of firms <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> will become more similar to that of firms not <b>opting</b> <b>out.</b> ...|$|R

Domains included basic information about the programme, types of objections and personal details required for identification purposes. Results One hundred <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> forms were analysed. Fifty-four forms mentioned that this programme was run by NHS England. Eighty-one forms provided 2 types of objections to data sharing and 15 provided only one objection. Only 26 forms mentioned that direct care would not be affected and 32 that patients maintain their right to opt back in anytime. All {{but one of the}} <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> forms we reviewed requested the name of the person wishing to <b>opt</b> <b>out.</b> Ninety-four required a date of birth and 33 an NHS number. Eighty-two required an address, 42 a telephone number and 7 an email address. Conclusion Numbers of patients (not) <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> should be treated with caution because the variability of information provided and the varied options for dissent may have caused confusion among patients. To ensure that dissent is in accordance with individual preferences and moral values, we recommend that well-designed information material and standardised <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> forms be developed for such data sharing initiatives...|$|R
