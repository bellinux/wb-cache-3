5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the native {{language}} of {{a significant part of the}} country's population is Russian, the language occupies a modest role in Israel's education system. Hebrew University started teaching Russian in 1962. In public schools, the first Russian-language classes were opened in the 1970s in large cities. The number of students enrolled in these programs dropped in the 1980s as immigration from the Soviet Union slowed down. In the 1990s, a Russian-language program carried out by local governments called Na'leh 16 included some 1,500 students.

The runaway accretion lasts between 10,000 and 100,000years and ends when the largest bodies exceed approximately 1,000km in diameter. Slowing of the accretion is caused by gravitational perturbations by large bodies on the remaining planetesimals. In addition, the influence of larger bodies stops further growth of smaller bodies.|$|E

5|$|If it was {{necessary}} to seize control of a castle an army could either launch an assault or lay siege. It was more efficient to starve the garrison out than to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites. Without relief from an external source, the defenders would eventually submit. Sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also applied to the fortified towns of the day.

5|$|Most {{vertebrate}} {{species have}} a cerebellum {{and one or}} more cerebellum-like structures, brain areas that resemble the cerebellum in terms of cytoarchitecture and neurochemistry. The only cerebellum-like structure found in mammals is the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), {{one of the two}} primary sensory nuclei that receive input directly from the auditory nerve. The DCN is a layered structure, with the bottom layer containing granule cells {{similar to those of the}} cerebellum, giving rise to parallel fibers that rise to the superficial layer and travel across it horizontally. The superficial layer contains a set of GABAergic neurons called cartwheel cells that resemble Purkinje cells anatomically and chemically—they receive parallel fiber input, but do not have any inputs that resemble climbing fibers. The output neurons of the DCN are pyramidal cells. They are glutamatergic, but also resemble Purkinje cells in some respects—they have spiny, flattened superficial dendritic trees that receive parallel fiber input, but they also have basal dendrites that receive input from auditory nerve fibers, which travel across the DCN in a direction at right angles to the parallel fibers. The DCN is most highly developed in rodents and other small animals, and is considerably reduced in primates. Its function is not well understood; the most popular speculations relate it to spatial hearing in <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 18 March 1889, Bury was arraigned for {{the murder}} of his wife; he entered a plea of not guilty. The trial was seen before Lord Young in the High Court of Justiciary on 28 March. Bury's defence team {{comprised}} solicitor David Tweedie and advocate William Hay; the prosecution was led by advocate depute Dugald or Dill McKechnie. The hearing lasted 13 hours. The prosecution witnesses included Ellen's sister Margaret Corney, William's former employer James Martin, the Burys' London landlady Elizabeth Haynes, William's drinking partner David Walker, Lieutenant Lamb and Drs Templeman and Littlejohn. After a break for supper, Hay presented the defence case, which was heavily dependent on Dr Lennox's testimony that Ellen had strangled herself. At 10:05p.m., Lord Young finished his summation, and the jury of 15 men retired to consider their verdict. After 25 minutes, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty with a recommendation for mercy. Lord Young asked the jury why they recommended mercy, and one of them replied that the medical evidence was contradictory, referring to Lennox's testimony. Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty, and the jury may have been trying to avoid passing a death sentence. Young told the jury to retire and reconsider their verdict until they were decided by the evidence <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> At 10:40p.m., they returned with a unanimous verdict of guilty.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide proposals for a reform of the future EU Rural Development policy, in the context of the 2014 - 2020 programming period. To this end, it is necessary to take stock of the main progress achieved by this policy over the past years. Furthermore, this paper intends to discuss the role of the main variables which can influence the future debate on the reform of RD in Europe. This paper is organised in three main sections. The first section summarises the main changes in RD since Agenda 20004 until the latest revision under the Health Check. This analysis seeks to highlight progress and weaknesses emerging from the main reviews carried out in the last decade. The second section is focused on the main variables of the policy context which might in <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> in <b>another</b> shape the content of RDPs after 2013,namely: the reform of the 1 st pillar, the EUROPE 2020 strategy and the future of cohesion policy. These three elements are strictly interlinked with the budget reform. This section includes a final comment on the rationales for a common RD policy. The third section develops some proposals concerning the key issues for a more efficient and effective RD (new priorities,a different programming system, a delivery system more strongly based upon a territorial approach and fostering innovation). ...|$|R
30|$|The key {{question}} is: {{what does this}} add to the explanatory value if the tier order can be <b>one</b> <b>way</b> - <b>or</b> <b>another?</b> Does the concept win or lose? Although the pyramid can {{be perceived as a}} static snapshot of the tiers of responsibility, it is nonetheless intended to be viewed as a flexible tool embodying a dynamic tension which allows the framework to adapt to enable a focus both on the present and the future. Clearly, corporate responsibilities have evolved over time as companies themselves have changed in relation to the business environment. Half a century ago, there was greatly stability in the business environment whereas today companies find themselves in much more dynamic situations, and this means that they have had to become more mature in the way they deal with these. In respect of corporate responsibility issues, the public (society) are expecting more, and business itself gives more. Indeed, CSR imperatives are now so pervasive that companies now have CR officers dedicated to managing this aspect of their existence, and operating as professionals in managing the companies’ relationships with all their stakeholders. The International Pyramid of CSR, like the concept, has failed. Success or failure should be measured in terms of a company’s net impact on the environment, and {{if there is to be}} any reversal of many of the world’s most pressing problems, e.g., social, environmental, local legislative, ethical trends and so on, a different kind of CSR is needed. It is easy to agree that we ought to be doing something good, and that we should contribute to doing ‘the right thing’, and there is evidence that the business community globally has been rapidly adopting CSR practices in both the developed and developing regions. We can see that corporations have learned to adapt to changes in economy, technology and politics. But they have also adapted to social change as public expectation has, over years and decades, experienced the modern corporation; which has been adoptable. The public have seen what it is and known what they have to do, and have done it. Consequently, the International Pyramid developed in this research and reported here, is built in a fashion that reflects the fundamental roles played and expected by business, which are seen as being to invest in society/community projects such that business implicitly concerns itself with the future.|$|R
6000|$|We {{have now}} {{gone through the}} first stage of Mr. Hastings's {{confiscation}} of the estates of these unhappy people. When it came to be put in execution, Mr. Middleton finds the Nabob reluctant in the greatest degree to make this sacrifice of his family and of all his nobility. It touched him in every way in which shame and sympathy can affect a man. He falls at the feet of Mr. Middleton; he says, [...] "I signed the treaty of Chunar upon an assurance that it was never meant to be put in force." [...] Mr. Middleton nevertheless proceeds; he sends the family of the Nabob out of the country; but he entertains fears of a general revolt as the consequence of this tyrannical act, and refers the case back to Mr. Hastings, who insists upon its being executed in its utmost extent. The Nabob again remonstrates in the strongest manner; he begs, he prays, he dissembles, he delays. One day he pretends to be willing to submit, the next he hangs back, just as the violence of Mr. Hastings or his own natural feelings and principles of justice dragged him <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> dragged him <b>another.</b> Mr. Middleton, trembling, and under the awe of that dreadful responsibility under which your Lordships may remember Mr. Hastings had expressly laid him upon that occasion, ventures at once to usurp the Nabob's government. He usurped it openly and avowedly. He declared that he himself would issue his purwannahs as governor of the country, for the purpose of executing this abominable confiscation. He assumed, I say, to himself the government of the country, and Mr. Hastings had armed him with a strong military force for that purpose; he declared he would order those troops to march for his support; he at last got this reluctant, struggling Nabob to consent in the manner we have described.|$|R
5|$|Valene's {{bitterness}} {{over her}} mother's indifference, {{and the subsequent}} loss of Lucy is not resolved until 1979 when she and Gary move to Knots Landing. Much of this early backstory is told through flashbacks in episodes of Knots Landing, and is only briefly referenced in Dallas. While working in a diner in 1978, Valene decided to wait for Lucy outside her school and they {{got to know each}} other. They stayed in contact with each other in secret for several months afterward. In the fall of 1978, Lucy arranges a reunion for her parents. Gary and Valene move back to Southfork for a short time, but their reunion is again undermined by J.R., who arranged for Gary to take charge of a failing company, hoping that the pressure would drive Gary away. Gary realized that he would fall off the wagon unless he left Southfork, so he departed. J.R. then turned on Valene, trying to bribe her, before ordering her to leave. In December 1979, Valene and Gary are reunited once more in Dallas, and get married for the second time. Gary's parents, Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes), as well as Gary's brother, Bobby (Patrick Duffy), and sister-in-law Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal), attend the wedding. Shortly afterward, they move to California to live in a home that Miss Ellie had bought for them as a wedding gift. Valene also appears in the final episode of Dallas during J.R.'s dream, which showed how things would have turned out had J.R. never existed.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the civil liability front to the nowadays biotechnological innovations allows the rescue of the questioning concerning about the true function of the Rights in the society, mainly in result {{of the speed of}} information and the constants scientific inventions of the world contemporary. In this dialogue between the scientific innovations and the legal adequacy to the behaviors is inferred that the Law cannot be waiting to concrete cases prescribe the subject. In contrast, the Law must bring efficient mechanisms to secure the contractual and extracontractual relations between the involved parts, and also to the society, especially if we think about the protection {{of the life of the}} future generations. In <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> in <b>another</b> <b>way,</b> its main objective continues being the protection of the basic rights, mainly the right to the worthy life. Such task is not easy, therefore the problem found in the present subject is that neither science has answers when it is inquired about the probable consequences of the research that involves the genetic manipulation in the vegetal cells and human beings cells. Obstruct such research does not become opportune, for the reason that is the hope for the cure of illnesses and bigger quality of life. On the other hand, “to play God” is preoccupying task because the damages that it can cause in the humanity. The global legislation, in the great majority, has not presented positions favorable to the genetic manipulation of cells of embryos. The present research aims to analyze the gaps left for the Law and the situations that greater complains attention: the question of the genetic damage and its recovery, especially with the application of the objective theory of the civil liability. A análise da responsabilidade civil frente às inovações biotecnológicas hodiernas permite o resgate do questionamento acerca da verdadeira função do direito perante a sociedade, principalmente em decorrência da velocidade de informações e das constantes descobertas científicas do Mundo Contemporâneo. Nesse diálogo entre as inovações científicas e a adequação jurídica aos comportamentos delas advindos, depreende-se que o direito não pode mais ficar à espera de casos concretos para regulamentar o assunto. Ao contrário, deve o direito ter o condão de trazer mecanismos assecuratórios eficientes às relações contratuais e extracontratuais firmadas entre as partes envolvidas, e também da sociedade de forma geral, se pensarmos na proteção da vida das gerações futuras. De uma forma ou de outra, seu objetivo principal continua sendo a proteção dos direitos fundamentais, principalmente o direito à vida digna. Tal tarefa não é fácil, pois o problema encontrado no presente tema é que tampouco a ciência tem resposta quando é inquirida sobre as prováveis conseqüências das pesquisas que envolvem a manipulação genética células vegetais e humanas. Refrear tais pesquisas não se faz oportuno, ante à esperança da cura de doenças e de maior qualidade de vida. Por outro lado, “brincar de Deus” é tarefa preocupante, ante os danos que porventura possam causar à humanidade. A legislação global, na grande maioria, não tem apresentado posições favoráveis à manipulação genética de células de embriões. O presente trabalho vem de encontro com as lacunas deixadas pela Lei e as situações que reclama maior atenção: a questão do dano genético e sua reparação civil, principalmente com relação à aplicação, nesses casos, da Teoria Objetiva da responsabilidade civil...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, we aim {{to explore}} whether the world is eternal or created {{through the eyes of}} the Hellenes and {{especially}} Aristotle and the Muslim theologians led by Ibn Rochd. Such exploration would be a sort of comparative study between religion and philosophy, and we do mean by religion here the monotheistic tenets represented by the Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam and we do mean by philosophy, mainly the ancient wisdom presented by the Greek philosophers. No one would deny that the doctrine of the eternity of the world is a complex doctrine, as there is a sort of overlap between all the subjects discussed within it. In other words, these subjects are themselves doctrines inside the main doctrine, which is the eternity of the world. This overlap is obvious when we raise subjects like the architecture of the cosmos, the basic elements that the world is made up of, God's existence, God-world relationship, eternity of time and motion and the immortality of the soul. When we do look at all these topics, the first idea that jumps into our mind is the big convergence between all these topics, in the sense that the discussion of one of them entails the discussion of the other <b>one</b> in some <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> In the middle of all these discussions, it is vital to raise the pluralist and monistic theories, the plurality of the worlds theory, Ibn Sina's necessary existent theory, Ibn Rochd's principle of corruptibility and Socrates' doctrine of the individuality and the transmigration of souls. Likewise, we have to raise Plotinus' theory of emanation, Aristotle's doctrine of the coeternity of matter and God, the theory of substance and the theory of hylomorphism. After the exhibition of all these divergent stances and different views of the nature and the last fate of our astonishing universe, the result that we do come out with is that there is no opposition between philosophy and religion, as they are two different disciplines using different mental tools to achieve the same goals. Hence, the revealed materials can support the philosophical findings and vice versa. Revelation only interferes when philosophy fails to explain unseen phenomena or supernatural occurrences. That is why, the eternity of the world doctrine can never be well understood without the combination of what is religious and what is philosophical. The Holy Scriptures themselves do address the human mind and urge it to use reason and the weapon of observation and contemplation to achieve a better understanding of all incidents and events occurring around human beings. This compatibility between religion and philosophy in particular and all sciences in general was the magnum opus of Ibn Rochd who elaborated his doctrine of the agreement between religion and philosophy and passed it on to Western Scholasticism.
