5|$|The creators' {{first choice}} for the role <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> was comedian Janeane Garofalo. Cox had {{originally}} been offered the role of Rachel but declined in favor of playing the character's best friend Monica because she was drawn to her strong personality. Meanwhile, the role of Rachel went to actress Jennifer Aniston, Cox's co-star to whom the role <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> had originally been offered. Before Friends aired, Monica's characterization was greatly debated among writers {{in regards to the}} character sleeping with a man on their first date during the pilot. Kauffman in particular greatly defended Monica, arguing with NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer over whether or not this would make the character too promiscuous. Ultimately, the episode aired unchanged after the studio surveyed the audience, the results of which returned in favor of Monica's existing storyline. The character's struggles with childhood obesity, challenges with romantic relationships and complicated relationship with her mother would eventually become popular staples of the show.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{entered the}} top 100 ranking {{for the first}} time on 20 September 1999 and started at the 1999 Marseille Open {{defeating}} the reigning champion of the 1998 French Open, Spaniard Carlos Moya. His first final came at the Marseille Open in 2000, where he lost to fellow Swiss Marc Rosset. Federer won the 2001 Hopman Cup representing Switzerland, along with Martina Hingis. The duo defeated the American pair <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> Seles and Jan-Michael Gambill in the finals. Federer's first singles win was at the 2001 Milan Indoor tournament, where he defeated Julien Boutter in the final. Although he won his first title already in 1999 on the Challenger tour, winning the doubles event in Segovia, Spain with Dutchman Sander Groen, the final was played on Federer's 18th birthday. In 2001, Federer made his first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the French Open, losing to former world #2 and eventual finalist Alex Corretja. His run to the French quarterfinals launched him into the top 15 {{for the first time}} in his career.|$|E

5|$|The tenth season closes several long-running storylines. Charlie {{breaks up}} with Ross {{to get back}} {{together}} with her ex-boyfriend. Joey and Rachel try to contend with Ross' feelings about them being together and decide {{it would be best}} to remain friends. Phoebe and Mike get married mid-season outside the Central Perk coffee house. Monica and Chandler apply to adopt a child and are chosen by Erica (Anna Faris). In the series finale, Erica gives birth to twins, to the surprise <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> and Chandler— a boy, Jack (after Monica's father), and a girl, Erica (named after the birth mother). Monica and Chandler prepare to move to the suburbs, and Joey becomes upset with the changes in his life. Rachel gets fired from her job and accepts a new offer in Paris, but Ross, realizing he loves her, chases after her. Rachel realizes she loves him, too, and cancels her flight to Paris, agreeing to stay with him. The series ends with all the friends plus Monica and Chandler's new babies leaving the apartment, heading to Central Perk for a final cup of coffee. The finale dialogue used in this series is by Chandler, making a joke for the last time. The camera's last view is of all of the character's keys to the apartment on the counter table, finishing with a shot of the apartment door.|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} the storm, the Alligator Rivers Region Advisory Committee began {{planting}} seedlings in deforested areas. By August 2006, {{a review of the}} growth of the new plants found that 81% to 88% of the seeds had survived and begun growing. To fully restore the South Alligator valley, environmentalists requested A$7.4million (US$6.6million) in funds. In a study at Magela Creek a year after the storm, it was determined that between 8% and 19% of the tree canopy lost due to the storm had begun to recover. Additional studies at the Gulungul Creek and the Alligator Rivers region revealed that suspended sediment values in flowing water had temporarily increased in the wake <b>of</b> <b>Monica.</b> The above-average values persisted for roughly a year before the streams returned to pre-cyclone sediment levels. In a study of the Arnhem forests which were devastated by the cyclone, environmentalists reported that it would take over 100years for the forest to recover. The storm's winds snapped numerous trees, estimated to have been over 200 years old and more than 60cm (23.6in) in diameter. It is estimated that it would take several hundred years before trees of similar sizes would flourish in the region.|$|E

25|$|Depressed {{over her}} four {{unsuccessful}} television shows, Aniston approached Warren Littlefield at a Los Angeles gas station asking for reassurance about her career. The head of NBC entertainment encouraged Aniston to continue acting, {{and a few}} months later helped cast her for Friends, a sitcom that was set to debut on NBC's 1994–1995 fall lineup. The producers of the show originally wanted Aniston to audition for the role <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> Geller, but Courteney Cox was considered to be better suited to the role. Thus, Aniston was cast as Rachel Green. She was also offered a spot as a featured player on Saturday Night Live, but turned it down to do Friends. She played the character of Rachel from 1994 until the show ended in 2004.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a {{negative}} review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four.

In addition, Vitaris noted that the introduction <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> Reyes was not satisfactorily explained.|$|E
500|$|On 24 April, the mid-level ridge south <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> weakened, {{causing the}} storm to turn towards the south-west. Following this, the storm made {{landfall}} in the Northern Territory, roughly [...] west of Maningrida, as a Category5 cyclone with winds of 250km/h (155mph 10-minute sustained). Not long after making landfall, the storm weakened extremely quickly. Most convective activity {{associated with the}} storm dissipated within nine hours of moving onshore. This resulted in the storm's maximum winds decreasing by 155km/h (100mph) in a 12-hour span. After this rapid weakening, the storm turned sharply west moving over the town of Jabiru as a Category2 cyclone. Within six hours of passing this town, the Bureau of Meteorology downgraded Monica to a tropical low, no longer producing gale-force winds. The JTWC issued their final advisory on the storm at 1800UTC that day. The remnants <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> persisted for several more days, tracking near Darwin on 25 April before turning south-east and accelerating over the Northern Territory. The remnants eventually dissipated on 28 April over central Australia.|$|E
500|$|As {{creator and}} writer, Kauffman {{confirmed}} that Monica's extremely organized personality {{is based on}} her own, explaining, [...] "I have a lot <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> in me, in terms of everything having {{to be a certain}} way." [...] Writing about the development of Monica's personality in USA Today, Robert Bianco observed that the character gradually evolves from [...] "the caring, nurturing mother figure ... into a slightly off-the-beam benevolent monarch." [...] By the show's final season, Monica's personality has been [...] "exacerbated for comedy" [...] to the point of which she becomes borderline [...] "cartoonish." ...|$|E

500|$|Andrew Harrison of The New Republic {{believes}} that the writers deliberately broke up any main character who was approaching a borderline life-changing relationship because [...] "The ones the Friends were really meant to be with were, after all, the other Friends". Because Monica and Joey were initially conceived as the show's two most sexual characters, Crane and Kauffman had originally intended {{for them to be}} the show's main couple, before ultimately replacing them with Ross and Rachel. The idea <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> and Joey was abandoned once the role of Joey was cast; actor Matt LeBlanc approached his character using much more of a [...] "big brother vibe" [...] in terms of Joey's relationship with Cox's character as opposed to a romantic one, which the writers ultimately preferred. According to Allison Piwowarski of Bustle, Monica and Joey's relationship would have greatly altered the trajectory of the entire series, having life-changing effects on its characters. Summarizing the role <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> in the series, Martin Gitlin wrote in his book The Greatest Sitcoms of All Time that while her friends [...] "were ... just out {{to make the most of}} their social lives", Monica [...] "sought to keep the others in line" [...] while searching for [...] "Mr. Right", who surprisingly turns out to be close friend Chandler. Several years before Monica and Chandler became romantically involved, Cox once joked in an interview that if her character were to ever have sex with another main character, it would most likely be Chandler. Crane and Kauffman had never intended to pair off Monica and Chandler with each other, and only decided to expand upon the idea of a relationship between the two friends upon realizing that viewers had [...] "fallen in love" [...] with the notion <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> and Chandler as a couple. According to Robert Bianco of USA Today, [...] "Their affair came out of the blue and was supposed to quickly return there — but something in the relationship clicked with viewers." [...] The idea <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> and Chandler's romantic arc originally surfaced much earlier in the series from writers Scott Silveri and Shana Goldberg-Meehan, who first observed the characters' chemistry in the season two episode [...] "The One Where Ross Finds Out", in which an idle and unemployed Monica is temporarily acting as Chandler's personal trainer. However, Silveri's suggestion was initially vetoed by the other writers, who felt that it was simply too soon to introduce another main couple to Friends having just recently paired off Ross and Rachel. Following Ross and Rachel's break up in season three, the writers felt that the timing was just about right to officially introduce Monica and Chandler as a couple, deciding that Friends [...] "can't simply rest on this one [...] relationship", while believing that Monica and Chandler's would ultimately provide a fun opportunity for the writers to explore brand new storylines.|$|E
500|$|Jessica Morgan, however, from Television Without Pity, {{gave the}} episode a more mixed review. She criticized the {{character}} <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> Reyes {{and called her}} [...] "Moronica". She ultimately gave the episode a C+ grade. Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk called the entry [...] "borderline weird" [...] and used it as evidence that [...] "the ninth season [...] arguably the worst season of the series." [...] The A.V. Club's Zack Handlen was generally unenthused writing [...] "It’s not a bad episode, exactly, but there doesn’t {{seem to be a}} lot of point to it. ... it makes for a forgettable hour." ...|$|E
500|$|Bianco {{observed}} that [...] "On most shows, linking two main characters like Monica and Chandler {{would have been}} an act of desperation." [...] However, [...] "On Friends, it was a stroke of genius that made both characters more appealing while providing a needed diversion from the show's central task: Retaining a romantic equilibrium between Ross and Rachel." [...] Monica and Chandler's relationship is the antithesis of Ross and Rachel's because it remained [...] "healthy and strong until the series ended", while the other couple was relentlessly on-and-off. Encyclopedia of Television author Horace Newcomb believes that Monica's feelings for Chandler are responsible for curing the latter's fear of commitment. Similarly, Slate writer Ruth Graham {{observed that}} [...] "Chandler is painted as a self-loathing loser with women, until he finally snags Monica at the end of Season 4." [...] Meanwhile, Silveri believes that Friends ultimately ran as long as it did due in part to Monica and Chandler's romance, explaining, [...] "if the center of Friends had remained Ross and Rachel, you would've seen a much shorter shelf life for the show"; Monica and Chandler's arc is believed to have extended the series by approximately three years. Crane and Kauffman had always intended to give Monica and Chandler a child. [...] When it finally came time for them to write the finale, the idea of the couple adopting newborn twins was conceived at the last minute simply [...] "for fun". [...] The birth <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> and Chandler's twins serves as one of the finale's main plots. They were named Jack and Erica – after Monica's father and their birth mother, respectively. – The twins are born three minutes and forty-six seconds apart. Although the surprise addition <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> and Chandler's twins was generally well received, critics questioned the fact that the babies are brought home from the hospital the same day as their delivery ...|$|E

500|$|More than 100 actors {{auditioned for}} the role of Doggett, but only about ten were seriously considered. Lou Diamond Phillips, Hart Bochner, and Bruce Campbell were among the ten. The {{producers}} chose Robert Patrick. Carter believed that the series could continue for another ten years with new leads, and the opening credits were accordingly redesigned in both seasons eight and nine to emphasize the new actors (along with Pileggi, who was finally listed as a main character). Doggett's presence did not give the series the ratings boost the network executives were hoping for. The eighth-season episode [...] "This is Not Happening" [...] marked the first appearance <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> Reyes, played by Gish, who became a main character in season nine. Her character was developed and introduced due to Anderson's possible departure {{at the end of the}} eighth season. Although Anderson stayed until the end, Gish became a series regular.|$|E
500|$|Having {{worked with}} David Schwimmer in the past, the series creators wrote the {{character}} of Ross with him in mind, {{and he was the}} first actor cast. Cox wanted to play the role <b>of</b> <b>Monica,</b> but the producers had her in mind to play Rachel because of her [...] "cheery, upbeat energy", which was not how they envisioned Monica; after Cox's audition, though, Kauffman agreed with Cox, and she got the role. When Matt LeBlanc auditioned for Joey, he put a [...] "different spin" [...] on the character. The writers did not originally intend for Joey to be dim, but found it to be a major source of comedy. LeBlanc also gave the character heart, which the writers did not realize Joey had. Although Crane and Kauffman did not want LeBlanc for the role at the time, they were told by the network to cast him. Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry and Lisa Kudrow were cast based on their auditions.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} <b>of</b> <b>Monica</b> Reyes, played by Annabeth Gish, who would become a main character in season nine.

Although Anderson would remain on until the end, Gish later became a series regular. When creating the character, series creator Chris Carter wanted to give the character a personality who had much in common with both Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. At the same time, however, Carter wanted the character to be different from Scully's character in a way that Doggett was different from Mulder, saying, [...] "as much as Robert Patrick was unlike Mulder, we needed someone who was equally unlike Scully." [...] Gish later noted that, [...] "Chris really wanted Monica to be a sunny force, which is hard to play sometimes. But it's a natural instinct for me; I can find happiness in the midst of darkness." ...|$|E
