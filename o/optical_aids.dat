25|$|Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) {{wrote the}} Book of Optics (1021), {{in which he}} {{developed}} a theory of vision and light which built {{on the work of}} the Roman writer Ptolemy (but which rejected Ptolemy's theory that light was emitted by the eye, insisting instead that light rays entered the eye), and was the most significant advance in this field until Kepler. The Book of Optics was an important stepping stone {{in the history of the}} scientific method and history of optics. The Latin translation of the Book of Optics influenced the works of many later European scientists, including Roger Bacon and Johannes Kepler. The book also influenced other aspects of European culture. In religion, for example, John Wycliffe, the intellectual progenitor of the Protestant Reformation, referred to Alhazen in discussing the seven deadly sins in terms of the distortions in the seven types of mirrors analyzed in De aspectibus. In literature, Alhazen's Book of Optics is praised in Guillaume de Lorris' Roman de la Rose. In art, the Book of Optics laid the foundations for the linear perspective technique and may have influenced the use of <b>optical</b> <b>aids</b> in Renaissance art (see Hockney-Falco thesis). These same techniques were later employed in the maps made by European cartographers such as Paolo Toscanelli during the Age of Exploration.|$|E

50|$|Art {{historians and}} others have criticized Hockney's {{argument}} {{on the grounds that}} the use of <b>optical</b> <b>aids,</b> though well-established in individual cases, has little value for explaining the overall development of Western art, and that historical records and paintings and photographs of art studios (sans optical devices), as well as present-day realist artists, demonstrate that high levels of realism are possible without <b>optical</b> <b>aids.</b>|$|E

50|$|As {{described}} in Secret Knowledge, in January 1999 {{during a visit}} to the National Gallery, London, Hockney conceived of the idea that <b>optical</b> <b>aids</b> were the key factor in the development of artistic realism. He was struck by the accuracy of portraits by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, and became convinced that Ingres had used a camera lucida or similar device. From there, Hockney began looking for signs of the use of <b>optical</b> <b>aids</b> in earlier paintings, creating what he called the Great Wall in his studio by organizing images of great realistic art by time period. What he saw as a sudden rise of realism around 1420, combined with Charles Falco's suggestion that concave mirrors could have been used in that period to project images, was the germ of the Hockney-Falco thesis.|$|E
5000|$|The Double Cluster is {{circumpolar}} (continuously {{above the}} horizon) from most northern temperate latitudes. It is in {{proximity to the}} constellation Cassiopeia. The Double Cluster is approximately the radiant of the Perseid meteor shower, which peaks annually around August 12 or 13.

5|$|Pallas is {{farther from}} Earth {{and has a}} much lower albedo than Vesta, and hence is dimmer as seen from Earth.

During rare perihelic oppositions, Pallas can reach a magnitude of +6.4, right on the edge of naked-eye visibility. During late February 2014 Pallas shone with magnitude 6.96.|$|R

5000|$|The Hockney-Falco {{thesis is}} a {{controversial}} theory of art history, advanced by artist David Hockney and physicist Charles M. Falco, suggesting that advances in realism and accuracy {{in the history}} of Western art since the Renaissance were primarily the result of <b>optical</b> <b>aids</b> such as the camera obscura, camera lucida, and curved mirrors, rather than solely due the development of artistic technique and skill. In a 2001 book, Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters, Hockney analyzed the work of the Old Masters and argued that the level of accuracy represented in their work is impossible to create by [...] "eyeballing it". Since then, Hockney and Falco have produced a number of publications on positive evidence of the use of <b>optical</b> <b>aids,</b> and the historical plausibility of such methods.|$|E

50|$|Even {{though the}} nebula has a {{relatively}} bright integrated magnitude of 7, it is spread over so large {{an area that}} the surface brightness is quite low, so the nebula is notorious among astronomers as being difficult to see. However, an observer can see the nebula clearly in a telescope using an OIII filter (a filter isolating the wavelength of light from doubly ionized oxygen), as almost all light from this nebula is emitted at this wavelength. An 8 in telescope equipped with an OIII filter shows the delicate lacework apparent in photographs, and with an OIII filter almost any telescope could conceivably see this nebula. Some argue {{that it can be}} seen without any <b>optical</b> <b>aid</b> except an OIII filter held up to the eye.|$|R

The main function of this sighting tube is to provide an observer with a darkened environment in order to strengthen his eyesight and give him more focus for finding the narrow crescent near the western horizon about the beginning of a lunar month. We first briefly review the history of altitude-azimuthal observational instruments, and then present a translation of Bīrūnī’s account, visualize the instrument in question by a 3 D virtual reconstruction, and comment upon its structure and applicability...|$|R
