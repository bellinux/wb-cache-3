500|$|The {{three types}} of Penrose tiling, P1P3, are {{described}} individually below. They have many common features: in each case, the tiles are constructed from shapes related to the pentagon (and hence to the golden ratio), but the basic tile shapes need to be supplemented by matching rules in order to tile aperiodically; these rules may be described using labeled vertices or edges, or patterns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> faces [...] alternatively the edge profile can be modified (e.g. by indentations and protrusions) to obtain an aperiodic set of prototiles.|$|E

2500|$|The Class of 1962 {{provided}} the school with its primary tradition when it donated a {{rendition of the}} [...] "Clancy" [...] mascot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> floor of the school. From 1962 to the school's renovation in 2006, the tradition dictated that each year's senior class protect the image from being trod upon by any student. After the renovation, the tile image was moved to a special display.|$|E

2500|$|Along {{the ramp}} {{leading to the}} southeastern fare control, there is an unused and uncompleted Roosevelt Avenue {{terminal}} station for the IND Second System directly above the Manhattan-bound platform. This terminal has an island platform with a trackway on each side. There are no rails in the trackbeds, but tiles depicting the station name <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> walls are present. The signs hanging over the platform, however, are blank. East of the station lies a long, dark section of a 3-block-long tunnel with provisions for a crossover and a ramp down to the Manhattan-bound local track of the active mainline below. The unused tunnel has about [...] of trackway. Along these trackways, trains from the lower level tracks can be seen. The never-used upper level platform is around , only long enough for eight [...] cars rather than the IND maximum of 10. The platform itself has been converted to offices and storage.|$|E
2500|$|As word of Cappon's death {{spread around}} the Princeton campus, it became [...] "one of the saddest days {{in the lives of}} anyone {{connected}} with Princeton sports in those years," [...] a moment which some compared to the day two years later when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. [...] Future U.S. Senator Bill Bradley was a freshman basketball player at the time. [...] One of his teammates found Bradley sitting alone at the Princeton Student Center eating a pint of ice cream after learning of Cappon's death. [...] With a dazed look of grief, Bradley noted, [...] "The two people who brought me here are gone," [...] referring to Cappon and Princeton's director of admissions who had recently retired. [...] In his profile of Cappon, Selden Edwards noted that he'd [...] "never been able to get that image from my mind, of the two naked old men <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> floor, Silent Ed cradling Cappy Cappon in his arms. Something out of Michelangelo." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, {{an update}} to the Start menu {{known as the}} [...] "Start screen" [...] was introduced. It covers the entire screen and no longer {{features}} the right column. It shows much larger tiles for programs and, whenever possible, displays dynamic content supplied by the program directly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> itself (known as a [...] "live tile"), behaving similarly to a widget. For instance, the live tile for an email client may display the number of unread emails. The Start screen allows users to uninstall their programs by right-clicking on them and selecting [...] "Uninstall". Pinned apps can be placed in groups. The search box is initially hidden but can be viewed by clicking the search button on the charms bar and can also be brought up as it receives a keyboard input. True to its name, the Start screen is the first screen that a user sees upon login.|$|E

It is therefore possible to score points on two colors by placing a single tile.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{consider}} a tiling with equal rectangular tiles with an asymmetric pattern on them, all oriented the same, in rows, with for each row {{a shift of}} a fraction, not one half, of a tile, always the same, then we have only translational symmetry, wallpaper group p1 (the same applies without shift). With rotational symmetry of order two of the pattern <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> we have p2 (more symmetry of the pattern <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> does not change that, because of {{the arrangement of the}} tiles). The rectangle is a more convenient unit to {{consider a}}s fundamental domain (or set of two of them) than a parallelogram consisting of part of a tile and part of another one.|$|E
50|$|A {{penetrating}} sealant {{will maintain}} the natural {{look of the}} tile. You should periodically test the seal by putting {{a few drops of}} water <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> in various places. If the water is absorbed, then another coat of sealant should be applied.|$|E
