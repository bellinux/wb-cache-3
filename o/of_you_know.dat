500|$|Used in {{the opening}} sequence, [...] "Die Another Day" [...] was played 13minutes into the film, where Bond is shown imprisoned and being {{tortured}} {{for over a year}} in a prison camp in Korea. Being a departure from the normal title sequence of the previous Bond films, Madonna faced difficulty in making the song blend with the theme of Die Another Day. Nevertheless, she understood the idea behind the opening scenes and tweaked the song accordingly. Some of the lyrics like [...] "I'm gonna destroy my ego ... Sigmund Freud ... Analyze this" [...] were derived from Madonna's interpretation of the film's storyline. She told an interviewer from Genre magazine that the lyrics were about [...] "destroying your ego, and it's juxtaposing the metaphor <b>of,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> the fight against good and bad, and it's set inside the whole universe of Bond". [...] "Die Another Day" [...] was never adapted into the main score of the film. The song was later added to the track list of American Life and was also featured on her third greatest hits album, Celebration (2009).|$|E

2500|$|Ricky Bell sat out {{the game}} with a {{shoulder}} injury, and Darryl Carlton left the game early. Tampa Bay quarterbacks were sacked ten times (still a team record as of 2009), and threw three interceptions. Eddie Brown's 11 punt returns set an NFL single-game record, also still standing. John McKay reacted angrily to Washington tackle Bill Brundige's postgame remarks that McKay's USC offense wouldnâ€™t work in the NFL. McKay called Brundige an [...] "idiot" [...] and a [...] "dumb tackle", and pointed out that the Redskins scored their first touchdown from the same formation. He then told reporters, [...] "none <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> anything about football", and chided them for asking why the Buccaneers were having trouble moving the ball, when they knew that several starters were out with injuries. The Tampa Bay defense held Washington to ten points, despite the Redskinsâ€™ eight possessions in Buccaneer territory. Washington players described it as {{among the best in the}} league, and coach George Allen said it was [...] "of championship caliber". [...] The 18th consecutive loss tied the Buccaneers with the 1972â€“1973 Houston Oilers for the third longest NFL losing streak.|$|E

In 1994 Clinton publicly demanded that the Haitian government step aside and restore democratic rule. Clinton deployed a large military force to surround the country in September 1994. Just before the troops reached Haiti, Clinton sent a delegation led by Carter, Nunn and Powell to urge CÃ©dras to step down and leave the country. CÃ©dras agreed and surrendered the government, and he and his top lieutenants left the country in October. Just days later, American forces escorted the countryâ€™s elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, into the capital. Afterwards, Clinton lavished praise on Nunn's delegation for averting a military strike on the nation. [...] "As all <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> at my request, President Carter, Gen. Colin Powell, and Sen. Sam Nunn went to Haiti to facilitate the dictators' departure. I have been in constant contact with them for the last two days.
