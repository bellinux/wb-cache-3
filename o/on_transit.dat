5|$|The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 {{mandated}} that all new construction <b>on</b> <b>transit</b> stations including making the stations handicapped accessible. Because the 1885 depot {{is very close}} to the tracks, such upgrades at the old station location would have been difficult. New platforms, with mini-high platforms on their west ends for level boarding, were built just west of the former station. A footbridge with two elevators was built to allow passengers to reach the outbound platform without crossing the tracks, which carry slow-moving CSX freight service as well as MBTA and Amtrak trains. The new station was built in 2000 and opened in early 2001.|$|E

For bright stars, this resolving power could be used to image a star's surface during a transit event and see the shadow of the planet transiting. This could provide a direct measurement of the planet's angular radius and, via parallax, its actual radius. This is more accurate than radius estimates based <b>on</b> <b>transit</b> photometry, which are dependent on stellar radius estimates which depend on models of star characteristics. Imaging also provides more accurate determination of the inclination than photometry does.|$|E
