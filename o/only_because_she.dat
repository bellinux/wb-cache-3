5|$|Without a role or rank, Kulikovsky brooded in Denmark, {{becoming}} moody and listless. A spinal injury sustained {{during the}} war, {{for which he}} had to wear a corset, remained unhealed. In 1925, Kulikovsky accompanied his wife to a Berlin nursing home to meet Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Olga's niece, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. According to Harriet von Rathlef, who witnessed the meeting, while Olga and Anderson conversed, he sat in a corner and sulked. Although Olga felt sympathy for Anderson, if <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was ill, she eventually denounced her as an impostor. Possibly, she was pressured to do so by Kulikovsky and Dowager Empress Marie.|$|E
5|$|As Harry learns {{more about}} his great enemy, the love lives of the main {{characters}} start to become more active. Ron and Hermione grow closer together, but after learning from his sister Ginny that Hermione had previously kissed Viktor Krum, Ron shuns her. Harry's attempts to repair things between the two fail, resulting in Ron going out with Lavender Brown and making Hermione jealous. After Ron is nearly killed in an attempt on Dumbledore's life, he and Hermione reconcile. Ron and Lavender break up when Lavender sees {{the two of them}} walking out of the boys dormitories together. However, this was <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> hadn't noticed Harry walking ahead of them. Harry develops feelings for Ginny, but is reluctant to pursue her for most of the year because of his friendship with Ron. Following a wild Quidditch victory Harry and Ginny finally strike up a relationship, with Ron's reluctant consent.|$|E
5|$|Hoste also {{remained}} at sea, cruising in the battered Amphion beyond {{the range of}} the shore batteries on Lesina. Hoste was furious at the behaviour of Flore's officers and sent a note into Lesina demanding that they give up the ship as indicated by its earlier surrender. In surrendering and then escaping, the officers of Flore had breached an informal rule of naval conflict under which a ship that voluntarily struck its flag submitted to an opponent in order to prevent continued loss of life among its crew. Flore had been able to pass unmolested through the British squadron <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was recognised to have surrendered, and to abuse this custom in this way was considered, in the Royal Navy especially, to be a dishonourable act. The French at Lesina did not respond to Hoste's note, and the British squadron was eventually forced to return to Lissa to effect repairs.|$|E

5|$|Wollstonecraft {{returned}} to London in April 1795, seeking Imlay, but he rejected her; {{the next month}} she attempted to commit suicide, but he saved her life (it is unclear how). In a last attempt to win him back, she embarked upon a hazardous trip to Scandinavia from June to September 1795, with only her one-year-old daughter and a maid, in order to conduct some business for him. Wollstonecraft's journey was daunting not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was travelling to what some considered a nearly uncivilized region {{during a time of}} war, but also because she was travelling without a male escort. When she {{returned to}} England and realized that her relationship with Imlay was over, she attempted suicide a second time. She went out on a rainy night, walked around to soak her clothes, and then jumped into the River Thames, where a stranger rescued her.|$|E

In 2001, she pleaded guilty to possession of explosives {{with the intent to}} murder and was sentenced to two consecutive terms of ten years to life, although she had been told as part of a plea bargain that she would serve no more than eight years. She attempted to change her plea, claiming to the judge that she pleaded guilty <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> believed she could not receive a fair trial for bombing charges considering public sentiment after the 9-11 terrorist attacks. She maintained her innocence, insisting that she personally had {{had nothing to do with}} making, possessing or placement of the pipe bombs. The judge refused her request.|$|E

Robin rushes to the nurses' station. Patrick proposes in front of all of their friends and other loved ones. While everyone is looking at Robin, she becomes so overwhelmed and leaves, leaving Patrick devastated. Patrick follows her to the park, where she is crying. She does not want him to marry her <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> is pregnant with his child, and although he states he wants to marry her for her, she still says no.

500|$|Voice actress Maggie Roswell left The Simpsons {{in spring}} 1999 after a pay dispute with Fox.

It was then announced by Roswell that she had asked for a raise, not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was tired of the traveling, {{but because of the}} increasing cost of flight tickets. Roswell was paid $1,500 to $2,000 per episode during the three seasons before she left, and she asked Fox for a raise to $6,000 per episode. However, Fox only offered her a $150 raise, which did not even cover the travel costs, so she decided to quit. As a result of Roswell's departure, the Maude Flanders character was killed off in the episode [...] "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily". Voice actress Marcia Mitzman Gaven was hired to fill in for Roswell's other characters. Roswell returned to The Simpsons in 2002 in the season premiere of the fourteenth season. She reached a deal with Fox to record her lines from her Denver home and thus the dispute ended.|$|E

In addition, one woman {{has served as the}} Lieutenant Governor, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, under Gov. Parris Glendening from 1995 to 2003. Another woman, Kristen Cox, who was the Secretary of Disabilities, unsuccessfully ran for Lieutenant Governor as the running mate of the incumbent Governor Robert Ehrlich, when the Lieutenant Governor at that time, Michael Steele, left office to run for the U.S. Senate. Cox was a unique person to run for that office, not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> is a woman, but also because she is legally blind.|$|E

500|$|Maggie Roswell left The Simpsons {{in spring}} 1999 after a pay dispute with Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs The Simpsons.

I loved doing the show and they thought that I would come back. But now I'm busy doing other things." [...] She further added that [...] "I was part of the backbone of The Simpsons and I don't think the money I asked for was exorbitant. I wasn't asking for what other cast members make.

500|$|As {{in many of}} Argento's films, {{which tend}} to eroticize the murder of {{beautiful}} women, gender, sexuality and power are major issues foregrounded by the film. The fictional novel within the film is described as being [...] "about human perversion {{and its effects on}} society". Male and female sexual deviancy are a central theme, with the victims being sexually liberated women who the first killer – conservative TV presenter Cristiano Berti – refers to as [...] "filthy, slimy perverts". The first victim is a sexually promiscuous shoplifter, and his next two are the lesbian reporter and her bisexual lover. Berti murders the comparatively normal Maria <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> inadvertently discovers his twisted compulsion. His [...] "moral crusade" [...] is inspired by – and in his mind given credibility by – Neal's novel. Neal's own motivations for becoming a killer are revealed in [...] "Freudian flashbacks". As summarized by McDonagh, these flashbacks [...] "expose how the misogyny evident in his books actually stems from being sexually humiliated by a beautiful woman in his youth." [...] McDonagh also notes that Tenebrae expands on the themes of sexuality and transvestitism found in Argento's earlier films, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, The Cat o' Nine Tails, Four Flies on Grey Velvet (1972), and Deep Red (1975), but believes that Tenebraes [...] "overall sensuality sets it apart from Argento's other gialli." [...] She says that the film's sexual content and abundant nudity make it [...] "the first of Argento's films to have an overtly erotic aspect", and further notes that [...] "Tenebrae is fraught with free-floating anxiety that is specifically sexual in nature." [...] Gracey notes that in several scenes the victims gaze directly into the camera, which demonstrates Argento's [...] "preoccupation with voyeurism and spectacle".|$|E
