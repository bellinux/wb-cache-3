40|$|We {{applied a}} {{two-stage}} value chain model {{to investigate the}} effects of input application and <b>occasional</b> <b>transaction</b> costs on vegetable marketing chain efficiencies with a farm household-level data set. In the first stage, the production efficiencies with the combination of resource endowments, capital and managerial inputs, and production techniques were evaluated; then at the second stage, the marketing technical efficiencies were determined under the marketing value of the vegetables for three typical marketing chains in Nanjing area, P. R. China. The impacts of the transaction costs to the supply chain technical efficiency both at the production and marketing stages were examined by using Tobit model. Study showed that transaction costs significantly impacts on vegetable marketing chain efficiency in research area. Results also revealed that the impacts of transaction costs on marketing chain efficiency differ cross chains. This paper concluded with {{the reduction of the}} various types of transaction costs incurred in the vegetable marketing chains as managerial implementations for technical efficiency improvement and farmers' income increasing.

40|$|We {{consider}} a {{transaction processing system}} with multiple servers (e. g. computer systems) in which transactions may fail at the different servers independently (due to the heterogeneity), and only {{a subset of the}} total transactions are affected. Due to this nature, a system is faulty for some transaction classes and good for others. Because failed transactions have a lower processing time, algorithms such as JSQ (join shortest queue) will route a disproportionate number of transactions to the failure prone systems, causing an artificially high transaction failure rate. We call this the black hole phenomena. In this paper, we present two algorithms for transaction routing to detect and control the black hole problem. The first algorithm routes transactions to systems based on server queue lengths and perceived failure rate. It also ensures that error prone systems are not completely ignored; <b>occasional</b> <b>transactions</b> (called sacrificial lambs) probe systems to detect repair. Detailed si [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The {{historic}} port of Palos was a river port, {{protected from}} winds and from pirate attacks, both major hazards to the ports of the time. It was {{located on the}} lower portion of the Río Tinto known then as the Canal de Palos, about 4 km from its mouth at the Atlantic and its confluence with the Odiel. The port probably grew simultaneously with the town, first as an anchorage for small vessels engaged almost exclusively in fishing on the beaches and estuaries and <b>occasional</b> commercial <b>transactions</b> to supply the small population.|$|R

We {{study the}} {{consequences}} of leniency – reduced legal sanctions for wrongdoers who spontaneously self-report to law enforcers – on sequential, bilateral, illegal transactions, such as corruption, manager-auditor collusion, or drug deals. It is known that leniency helps deterring illegal relationships sustained by repeated interaction.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{consequences}} of 'leniency' - reduced legal sanctions for wrongdoers who spontaneously self-report to law enforcers - on corruption, drug dealing, {{and other forms of}} sequential, bilateral, illegal trade. We find that when not properly designed, leniency may be highly counterproductive. In reality leniency is typically "moderate," in the sense of only reducing, or at best cancelling the sanctions for the self-reporting party. Moderate leniency may greatly facilitate the enforcement of long-term illegal trade relations, and may even provide an effective enforcement mechanism for <b>occasional</b> (one-shot) illegal <b>transactions,</b> which would not be enforceable otherwise.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{incorporate}} achievements of the New Institutional and Transaction Costs Economics to analysis of efficiency of agrarian organizations in transitional economies. That modern framework for analysis of agrarian organizations is based on their role to govern transactions between individual agents. Since governing (coordination, organization) of transactions is associated with significant costs (for finding best prices and partners, for negotiation and contracting, for monitoring and enforcement of contract terms, for adjustment and re-negotiation according to changed conditions of exchange, for dispute resolutions etc.), the economic efficiency of agrarian organizations has to assess not only their capacity to minimize the production costs, but their potential to economize transacting costs as well. Initially, main kinds of transactions of the managers of agrarian transactions (farms entrepreneurs) are clarified as land, labor, service, inputs, and finance supply; marketing; and collective actions. After that, the alternative market, non-market, and mixed modes for organization of different types of agrarian transitions are identified. Next, various types of costs associated with each form of transacting are determined. And then, the comparative efficiency of different governance structures is estimated according to (minimum) transacting costs criteria. One direction for evaluation of comparative efficiency of governing structures is based on direct assessment of items of costs for transaction in different organizations. However, that manner is often restricted since: difficulties (or impossibility) to measure absolute level of transaction costs; opposite dynamics of different items of costs in various organizations; great use of complex (and interlinked) rather than pure modes in transitional agriculture; and not existence (missing) of alternative form for organization (the base for comparison). Another direction is through comparative structural (qualitative) analysis of alternative governing forms. Firstly, critical factors of transactions in particular institutional environment are identified. These factors affect transaction costs variation, and they are associated: with behavioral characteristic of agrarian agents (bounded rationality, tendency for opportunism, building of reputation, risk aversion, level of trusts); and with economic dimensions of individual transactions (frequency, uncertainty, assets specificity and appropriability). Secondly, assessment is made on effective potential of alternative organizational modes to: minimize bounded rationality of agrarian agents and uncertainty associated with transacting; to appropriate and protect private investments from possible opportunism; to recover long-term investments for organizational development through high recurrence of transactions between same agents; to exploit economy of size and scale on specific for relationship with a particular partner capital etc. Third, principal matrix of generic organizational modes is build for effective governance of transactions with different combination of critical dimensions: free market mode if effective to carry out transactions with high appropriability and low assets specificity; the special contract form is appropriate for transactions with high frequency, and increased uncertainty and assets specificity; the internal integration can manage effectively repeated transactions with high capital dependency and big uncertainty; the hybrid and public modes are the most effective forms for <b>occasional</b> <b>transactions</b> with low appropriability and high assets specificity. Finally, effective horizontal and vertical boundaries of every specific form within each generic modes could be determined through comparison of their potential to explore economy of size (scale) on specific or (and) specialized assets, and their comparative efficiency to minimize bounded rationality and to control opportunism of counterparts. agrarian governance, efficiency of agrarian organizations, new institutional and transaction costs economics...|$|R
