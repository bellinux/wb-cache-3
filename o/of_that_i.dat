Li and Wang then succeeded in the doubles game against Seok and Dang Ye Seo 11–9, 11–6, 6–11, 11–5. This {{marked the first time}} Singapore had won more than one medal at an Olympic Games.

500|$|According to Kahn, Spears pitched him her {{original}} concept, which included all the main elements {{used in the}} final version. Spears thought of the video as a sequel to [...] "Toxic", as seen in her documentary , whereas Kahn approached it as [...] "a 2008 answer" [...] to the previous clip. He added that, [...] "'Toxic' was a crystallization of her career at that time, [...] There are elements and moments <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt could [...] improved. [...] {{is a bit more}} fashion-forward". About how the concept of the video related to their previous work, Kahn commented that [...] "It's just a great girl fantasy. There are things she's really good at, like having a really natural knack for knowing what girls want. [...] It's a much more mature sound and much more mature lyrics, and she always has the greatest ideas. She's hyper-aware of pop culture".|$|E

[...] "When they were mixing it, we were sitting around and Bob Johnston came in and said, 'What {{do you want to}} call this?' And [...] just like said them out one at a time... Free association and silliness, I'm sure, played a big role." [...] Another Dylan chronicler, Oliver Trager, notes that besides spelling out the initials of Dylan's first name, the album title is also a riff on Brecht on Brecht, a stage production based on works by German playwright Bertolt Brecht that had influenced his early songwriting. Dylan himself has said of the title: [...] "Well, I don't even recall exactly how it came up, but I know it was all in good faith... I don't know who thought <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> certainly didn't." ...|$|E

I think this speaks volumes to where you are, what you going through, what you living and how you feel." [...] Consequently, Christina Aguilera was chosen as the featured guest on the song, which appeared on T.I.'s album No Mercy. Alex da Kid, producer of the song, said about the collaboration, [...] "I love it. I think it's amazing.

It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein {{at the corner of}} Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: [...] "He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat." [...] In her memoir, A Freewheelin' Time, Rotolo analyzed the significance of the cover art: ...|$|E

[...] Several months after this interview, the character was romantically linked to newcomer and former guest star, general surgical consultant Abra Durant, played by Adrian Edmondson. Edmondson departed from and returned to the show several times, with Kyla and Abra breaking up and reuniting on multiple occasions. Asked in February 2008 whether the two would ever get back together, Ayola responded: [...] "He treated Kyla like dirt, so I don’t know if she’ll forgive him, but I love working with Ade – he’s a gorgeous man." [...] The two ultimately left Holby together, moving to Ghana.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Falcon and the D'ohman" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. The {{plot of the}} episode has been criticized by some reviewers. Kyle Lemmon of Under the Radar gave the episode a three out of ten rating, concluding that [...] "this new episode is rarely grounded {{in any kind of}} reality. The best examples of The Simpsons center the situational humor in somewhat plausible scenarios within the town. I guess after so many years, they've completely run out of ideas." [...] Similarly, Television Blend's Jesse Carp wrote that the plot shows [...] "essentially what is wrong with the show and why I stopped watching. Because of the endless amount of material needed to keep a series running for twenty three years, they have to resort to outlandish plots and endless cameos to stay interesting. The best episodes,... definitely have some absurd elements but they're all firmly grounded in a fairly real world of Springfield, USA and its colorful cast of characters. I'd like to see more <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> miss them." ...|$|E

A poll conducted by the journal Evenimentul Zilei nominated the track as the best song of 1993, and the nationwide station Radio Contact awarded Pascu its [...] "Composer of the Year" [...] title. Mixed Grill marked Pascu's brief experimentation with a fusion of rock and reggae. [...] Hits such as [...] "Gizzi" [...] and [...] "Mi-am luat colac" [...] ("I Got Me a Lifebuoy") led some to consider {{him one of the}} pioneers of Romanian reggae, years ahead of acts like El Negro and Pacha Man. The mix of genres became characteristic of Pascu's work in music: [...] "When I was writing records, I figured that, should someone, say, be playing my record at a party, they would have several kinds to choose from, and they would not grow bored. But it's not because <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> think that's how inspiration visits me, that this is how I write. I won't stick to any one musical genre." [...] In addition to the piano, guitar and drums, Pascu also began playing the harmonica.|$|E

McCormack recalls after performing in Godspell, his feelings towards becoming an actor solidified.
