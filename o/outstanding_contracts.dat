2500|$|In {{the credit}} default swap (CDS) market, the {{standard}} contracts typically used between parties to a swap define the action of placing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship to be equivalent to bankruptcy, because {{of the change in}} management control. In CDS parlance, this is termed a credit event, and that triggers the settling of <b>outstanding</b> <b>contracts</b> for the derivatives, which are used to hedge or speculate on the potential risk that a company will default on its bonds. The two GSEs have approximately US$1.5 trillion in bonds outstanding, and since the market in {{credit default swap}}s is not public, there is no central reporting mechanism to verify how many credit default swaps are linked to those bonds. One estimate floated is US$500 billion, and that the entire [...] CDS market has a notional value in the vicinity of US$62 trillion.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} to emphasize that Futures contracts, like debt contracts, are in zero net supply in the aggregate economy. One person's long contract is another person's short contract.

It's an approximate measure of the elasticity of uncertainty relative to the convergence of price.|$|E

50|$|The graph above {{shows the}} total {{notional}} value of derivatives relative to US Wealth measures. It {{is important to}} note for the casual observer that, in many cases, notional values of derivatives carry little meaning. Often the parties cannot easily agree on terms to close a derivative contract. The common solution has been to create an equal and opposite contract, often with a different party, in order to net payments (Derivatives market#Netting), thus eliminating all but the counterparty risk of the contract, but doubling the nominal value of <b>outstanding</b> <b>contracts.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{a company}} enters {{insolvency}} (either through bankruptcy or FDIC receivership), an automatic stay is triggered that generally prohibits creditors and counterparties from terminating, offsetting against collateral, or taking any other mitigating action {{with respect to}} their <b>outstanding</b> <b>contracts</b> with the insolvent company. However, under US law counterparties to QFCs are exempt from this stay and may usually begin to exercise their contractual rights after the close of business the next day. In case of receivership, the FDIC must decide within this time period whether to transfer the QFC to another institution, retain the QFC and allow the counterparty to terminate it, or repudiate the QFC and pay out the counterparty.|$|E

Cutty Sark was eventually launched on 22 November 1869, nearly five months late, by Captain Moodie’s wife.

Cox, who had worked with Kesha before, passed along the demos to a friend at BMI, who passed it to the manager of Lukasz Gottwald, known as Dr. Luke. At the age of eighteen, Kesha signed to Dr. Luke's label, Kemosabe Records, and his publishing company, Prescription Songs. Luke was busy with other projects at the time, and Kesha ultimately wound up signed to David Sonenberg's management company, DAS. While at DAS she worked with several top writers and producers, but rarely worked with or even spoke to Luke. DAS searched for a label deal for Kesha despite her still being in a signed contract with Luke. Kara DioGuardi, an artists and repertoire (A) representative for Warner, was also interested in signing Kesha but the deal never went through because of the <b>outstanding</b> <b>contract</b> with Luke. Shortly after, Kesha and DAS parted ways and Kesha wound up reunited with Luke.|$|R

5000|$|Amerigo Vespucci {{was educated}} by his uncle, Fra Giorgio Antonio Vespucci, a Dominican friar {{of the monastery}} of San Marco in Florence. While his elder {{brothers}} {{were sent to the}} University of Pisa to pursue scholarly careers, Amerigo Vespucci embraced a mercantile life, and was hired as a clerk by the Florentine commercial house of Medici, headed by Lorenzo de' Medici. Vespucci acquired the favor and protection of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici who became the head of the business after the elder Lorenzo's death in 1492. In March 1492, the Medici dispatched the thirty-eight-year-old Vespucci and Donato Niccolini as confidential agents to look into the Medici branch office in Cádiz (Spain), whose managers and dealings were under suspicion. [...] In April 1495, by the intrigues of Bishop Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca, the Crown of Castile broke their monopoly deal with Christopher Columbus and began handing out licenses to other navigators for the West Indies. Just around this time (1495-96), Vespucci was engaged as the executor of Giannotto Berardi, an Italian merchant who had recently died in Seville.
