40|$|Abstract. A {{number of}} newly Ln-N bond valence {{parameters}} were quantitatively estimated, which {{allowed us to}} obtain all Ln-N bond lengths with different coordination numbers in metal <b>organic</b> <b>complexes.</b> Twenty linear correlations among the mean bond valence parameters of Ln-O, Ln-N, Ln-S, Ln-Cl and Ln-C bonds of metal <b>organic</b> <b>complexes</b> have been well established and denoted {{by a set of}} linearity equations, which provides us a useful method to determine the bond valence parameters of other type Ln-atom bonds in coordination chemistry.

50|$|Büchner is {{not always}} clear in his theory of the {{relation}} between matter and force. At one time he refuses to explain it, but generally he assumes that all natural and spiritual forces are indwelling in matter. Just as a steam engine, he says in Kraft und Stoff (7th ed., p. 130), produces motion, so the intricate <b>organic</b> <b>complex</b> of force-bearing substance in an animal organism produces a total sum of certain effects, which, when bound together in a unity, are called by us mind, soul, thought. Here he postulates force and mind as emanating from original matter, a materialistic monism. But in other parts of his works he suggests that mind and matter are two different aspects of that which is the basis of all things, a monism which is not necessarily materialistic.|$|E
50|$|These acid soils have a B horizon {{containing}} accumulations of amorphous materials {{composed of}} humified organic matter associated with aluminum and iron. They develop most commonly in sandy materials {{in areas of}} cold, humid climate under forest or shrub vegetation. Water moving downward through the relatively porous material leaches out basic elements (e.g., calcium), and acidic conditions develop. Soluble organic substances formed by decomposition of the forest litter attack soil minerals in surface horizons, {{and much of the}} iron and aluminum released combines with this organic material. When the proportion of aluminum and iron to organic matter reaches a critical level, the <b>organic</b> <b>complex</b> becomes insoluble and is deposited in the B horizon. Dissolved aluminum and iron may also move downward in inorganic forms and be deposited as aluminum-silicon complexes and iron oxides. An Ae (light grey, strongly leached) horizon usually overlies the Podzolic B horizon.|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{environmental}} factors {{are known to}} modify the toxicity of heavy metals on algae. This study was undertaken to {{examine the impact of}} some inorganic and <b>organic</b> <b>complexes</b> on the toxicity of copper using the isolated algal species (Chlorella vulgaris). The data illustrate that the amount of available forms of copper (copper free ions) gradually decreased with increasing the concentrations of all tested inorganic and <b>organic</b> <b>complexes</b> (carbonates, EDTA, Glycine and calcium). The toxicity of a metal is controlled by the concentrations of the available form (s) and not by the total concentration of the metal. In other words, the availability and the toxicity depend on the concentrations of the different physico-chemical forms (speciation) of the metals in their natural environments...|$|R
50|$|Gibbsite is not {{stable in}} {{presence}} of quartz {{and it will}} be changed into kaolinite minerals, so gibbsite has formed after the deposition and we can call it neo-formation gibbsite. Now, the main question is about gibbsite formation in the middle of kaolin series. Due to the pH of leaching, a dissolution of Al2O3 or SiO2 can occur (podzol or laterite profile) The first theory tries to describe this with podzol profiles: it assumes the leaching of silica from minerals and accordingly the gibbsite formation from leached kaolin. We thus should find the hyper-aluminous materials, containing gibbsite in the lower series of kaolin. On the other hand, a second theory proposes the procedure of aluminium leaching in a very acid medium, in deposited organic materials (lignite) with clay. The organic materials can accelerate the solubilization and transportation of aluminium ions with intervention of <b>organic</b> <b>complex.</b> proposed the following scenarios for this dissolved aluminium.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} show how time {{may not be the}} only schema, Professor Walsh {{suggested}} that there is [...] "… the possibility of making sense of the categories in organic as opposed to mechanical terms." [...] He hypothesized that [...] "Elements in an <b>organic</b> <b>complex</b> would here take the place of elements in a temporal situation. Substance might be interpreted in terms of growth and form as opposed to what underlies mechanical change, and causality be thought of in terms of purpose and function." [...] However, Professor Walsh concluded that Kant's choice of time as schema was more precise than any alternative choices. In spite of the general difficulty in understanding Schematism, he asserted that [...] "… Kant's doctrine of schematism, if not altogether satisfactory at the theoretical level, will continue to stand on the strong empirical ground that the schemata offered do enable us to give real meaning to the categories and find for them a genuine use." ...|$|E
50|$|Unlike spectroscopic methods, X-ray {{crystallography}} always {{allows for}} unambiguous structure determination and provides precise bond angles and lengths totally unavailable through spectroscopy. It {{is often used}} in physical organic chemistry to provide an absolute molecular configuration and is an important tool in improving the synthesis of a pure enantiomeric substance. It is also {{the only way to}} identify the position and bonding of elements that lack an NMR active nucleus such as oxygen. Indeed, before x-ray structural determination methods were made available in the early 20th century all organic structures were entirely conjectural: tetrahedral carbon, for example, was only confirmed by the crystal structure of diamond, and the delocalized structure of benzene was confirmed by the crystal structure of hexamethylbenzene. While crystallography provides organic chemists with highly satisfying data, it is not an everyday technique in organic chemistry because a perfect single crystal of a target compound must be grown. Only complex molecules, for which NMR data cannot be unambiguously interpreted, require this technique. In the example below, the structure of the host-guest complex would have been quite difficult to solve without a single crystal structure: there are no protons on the fullerene, and with no covalent bonds between the two halves of the <b>organic</b> <b>complex</b> spectroscopy alone was unable to prove the hypothesized structure.|$|E
50|$|Using {{electrochemical}} techniques, it {{is possible}} to show that bioactive trace metals (zinc, cobalt, cadmium, iron and copper) are bound by organic ligands in surface seawater. These ligand complexes serve to lower the bioavailability of trace metals within the ocean. For example, copper, which may be toxic to open ocean phytoplankton and bacteria, can form <b>organic</b> <b>complexes.</b> The formation of these complexes reduces the concentrations of bioavailable inorganic complexes of copper that could be toxic to sea life at high concentrations. Unlike copper, zinc toxicity in marine phytoplankton is low and there is no advantage to increasing the organic binding of Zn2+. In high nutrient-low chlorophyll regions, iron is the limiting nutrient, with the dominant species being strong <b>organic</b> <b>complexes</b> of Fe(III).|$|R

This was done to help establish {{the stability of the}} An(VI) oxidation state depended on the pH nd relative strength of the various oxidation state-specific complexes. At low ionic strength and pH 6, NpO{sub 2 }{sup 2 +} was rapidly reduced to form NpO{sub 2 }{sup +} <b>organic</b> <b>complexes.</b> At longer times, Np(IV) <b>organic</b> <b>complexes</b> were observed in the presence of citrate. PuO{sub 2 }{sup 2 +} was predominantly reduced to Pu{sup 4 +}, resulting in the formation of <b>organic</b> <b>complexes</b> or polymeric/hydrolytic precipitates. The relative rates of reduction to the An(V) complex were EDTA > citrate > oxalate. Subsequent reduction to An(IV) complexes, however, occurred in the following order: citrate > EDTA > oxalate because of the stability of the An(VI) -EDTA complex. The presence of organic complexants led to the rapid {{reduction of}} NpO{sub 2 }{sup 2 +} and PuO{sub 2 }{sup 2 +} in G-Seep brine at pHs 5 and 7. At pHs 8 and 10 in ERDA- 6 brine, carbonate and hydrolytic complexes predominated and slowed down or prevented the reduction of An(VI) by the organics present...|$|R
