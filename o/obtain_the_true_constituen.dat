40|$|Part II of {{this paper}} elaborates on the unique {{capability}} of the proposed power flow analysis framework to <b>obtain</b> <b>the</b> <b>true</b> solution corresponding to the stable operating point of a network. It explains <b>the</b> significance of <b>obtaining</b> <b>the</b> <b>true</b> solution for an accurate assessment of the voltage collapse margin. This feature distinguishes the framework from all iterative and non-iterative heuristic approaches as demonstrated {{in the context of}} a 7 -bus network with Newton-Raphson, its variants and semidefinite and moment-based relaxations of power flow. Another important feature of this framework is that it <b>obtains</b> <b>the</b> <b>true</b> solution when it exists and declares its non-existence otherwise. This is demonstrated in the context of small networks and in comparison with heuristic approaches. This paper also explores how the proposed framework detects a limit-induced bifurcation where a network controller reaching its limit can initiate voltage collapse. Comment: 11 page...|$|R

In {{regression}} learning, it {{is often}} difficult to <b>obtain</b> <b>the</b> <b>true</b> values of <b>the</b> label variables, while multiple sources of noisy estimates of lower quality are readily available. To address this problem, we propose a new Bayesian approach that learns a regression model from data with noisy labels provided by multiple oracles. The proposed method provides closed form solution for model parameters and is applicable to both linear and nonlinear regression problems. In our experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets this new regression model was consistently more accurate than a model trained with averaged estimates from multiple oracles as labels. ...|$|R
