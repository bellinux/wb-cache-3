40|$|The hairdresser {{occupation}} {{is classified}} as probably carcinogenic to humans based on an excess risk for urinary bladder cancer, but it is unclear if current work as a hairdresser entails such a risk. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate if hairdressers have an ongoing exposure to selected carcinogenic aromatic amines. We recruited 295 hairdressers, 32 consumers of hair dyes and 60 controls. All participants were non-smoking females, 18 - 55 years of age. Exposure over the past 4 months was determined for eight aromatic amines measured as haemoglobin (Hb) adducts. Hb adduct concentrations for hairdressers and consumers were not significantly {{higher than those of}} the controls for any of the eight aromatic amines. However, within the hairdresser group, ortho (o) and meta (m) -toluidine adduct concentrations tended to increase with the number of performed treatments with light-colour oxidative hair dyes. Furthermore, Hb adduct concentrations of o-toluidine increased significantly with the number of performed treatments of hair waving and m-toluidine adducts with the number of performed treatments with other <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye.</b> Professional hair products, mainly oxidative hair dyes, were collected from hairdressing salons and analysed for o-toluidine content. o-Toluidine was found in most of the analysed oxidative hair dyes but with a wide range in concentrations, even for the same colours. For semi-permanent (non-oxidative) hair dyes, oxidizing agents, hair waving products, and bleaching products, the content of o-toluidine was low or below limit of quantitation. To explore the effect of exposure to o- and m-toluidine among hairdressers, we determined telomere length and methylation of genes related to bladder or lung cancer. Hairdressers had a modest shortening of telomere length compared to non-hairdressers. No overall associations between telomere length and any of the Hb adducts were found, and no clear patterns between exposure as a hairdresser and hypermethylation of the selected genes. In conclusion hairdressers seem to have an ongoing occupational exposure to o- and m-toluidine as indicated by the associations with performed treatments with light-colour <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye,</b> other <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> and hair waving. This is further supported by our finding of o-toluidine in most of the analysed oxidative hair dyes. However, no clear patterns were found between exposure as a hairdressers and hypermethylation of genes associated with bladder cancer and lung cancer. We observed a modest shortening of telomere length among the hairdressers, but the causality of the observation is uncertain since no overall exposure-response association was observed...|$|E

40|$|<b>Oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> are {{the most}} {{important}} hair dying products. Hairdressers are exposed to the allergens found in <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> during the process of applying <b>dyes</b> to the <b>hair,</b> when cutting freshly <b>dyed</b> <b>hair,</b> or as a consequence of prior contamination of the working environment. pphenylenediamine, toluene- 2, 5 -diamine and its sulphate {{are the most}} common ingredients in <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> that cause allergic contact dermatitis in hairdressers. Cross-reactivity of p-phenylenediamine with para-amino benzoic acid, sulphonamides, sulphonylurea, dapsone, azo dyes, benzocaine, procaine, and black henna temporary tattoos is possible. Allergic contact dermatitis is classified as delayed-type hypersensitivity, according to Coombs and Gell. Skin changes typically appear on the hands after previous sensitization to causative allergens. Combined with the patient’s overall medical and work history and clinical picture, epicutaneous testing is the basic diagnostic procedure for confirming the diagnosis and identifying the causative allergens. The simplest and most effective measure for preventing the occurrence of allergic contact dermatitis in hairdressers is prevention. Preventive measures should be applied as early as in the beginning stage of vocational guidance for this profession. It is important to include health education in the process of professional training and to implement general technical safety measures, in order to reduce sensitization to allergens in hairdressing. Here, special emphasis must be given to the correct use of protective gloves.

However, little is known about immune responses to PTD-containing <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> Objectives To study immune responses induced by PTD-containing <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> in mice. Methods Immune responses against two different permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> products containing 1 · 60 % (w/w) and 0 · 48 % (w/w) PTD within the colour gel, and various concentrations of pure PTD were studied. The local inflammatory response was measured by ear swelling and cell infiltration, and T- and B-cell infiltration and proliferation was determined in the draining lymph nodes. Results Concentration-dependent immune responses were seen to PTD both in the skin and draining lymph nodes. The <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> containing 1 · 60 % PTD induced strong local inflammation and caused T- and B-cell infiltration and proliferation as well as an increased number of regulatory T cells in the draining lymph nodes. In contrast, the <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> containing 0 · 48 % PTD induced skin inflammation but only minor responses in the draining lymph nodes. Conclusions Consumer-available PTD-containing permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> can be potent immune activators inducing both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses.

40|$|Background: Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} to <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> products {{is an important}} health care issue since the practice of hair dyeing is increasing worldwide and the sensitization rate to the mainly used ingredient, para-phenylenediamine (PPD), is relatively high. Immunologic cross-reactivity to chemicals structurally related to PPD is a common issue and complicates the development of alternative hair dye ingredients. Objective: To determine the rate of cross-reactivity to the newly developed PPD derivative F 000175918 by means of patch testing previously PPD-sensitized individuals, using an <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> simulation. Methods: Previously PPD-sensitized individuals (+, ++ or +++ reactions at diagnostic patch testing) {{with a history of}} allergic {{contact dermatitis}} after using hair dye products, were patch tested with PPD derivative F 000175918. The oxidative hair dyeing process was simulated using a regular hair dye solution containing the PPD derivative and mixing this in a 1 : 1 ratio with hydrogen peroxide. Application times were 30, 45 and 60 minutes. The patch-tested skin areas were assessed after 48 and 72 hours. After 7 days an assessment for eventual late reactions was performed. Results: Cross-reactivity to PPD derivative F 000175918 occurred in 11 out of 29 of subjects (38 %). Depending on the individual PPD sensitization status, extremely sensitized subjects (+++) reacted in 2 out of 3 cases (67 %), strongly sensitized subjects (++) in 6 out of 11 cases (55 %) and weakly sensitized subjects (+) in 3 out of 15 cases (20 %). No late reactions, indicative for active sensitization, occurred in the negative responders. Conclusion: Although PPD derivative F 000175918 is a hair dye ingredient with a lower sensitizing potential than the commonly used ones, it is still likely to give cross-reactions in previously PPD-sensitized individuals, especially in those with a high sensitization status (++ and +++). ...|$|E
30|$|With {{the first}} {{application}} of para-phenylenediamine (PPD) for {{the generation of}} an azo dye in the year 1863, a new area in the synthesis of organic dyes started up [1].

The PPD methyl analogue, para-toluenediamine (PTD), firstly synthesized in 1877, has a similar application profile but is produced in lesser amounts, e.g., as intermediate for the synthesis of the azo dyes Basic Red 2 and Acid Brown 103 [6]. In the last years, PTD has widely replaced PPD as a hair dye component, at least in Europe [7].|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, ten adult {{domestic}} rabbits {{were exposed to}} an <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> for 9 months at weekly intervals. The main blood chemical parameters {{as well as the}} total proteins were estimated at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 months post-exposure. The exposed rabbits manifested increased serum level of alkaline phosphatase, Aspartate Transaminase (AST), amylase, cholesterol, triglyceride, billirubin, creatinine and urea. Serum level of Alanine Transaminase (ALT), Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), glucose and potassium were decreased as compared with control levels. At all time intervals, the plasma proteins concentration in the exposed rabbits was comparatively decreased. It is concluded that the chemical ingredients of used hair dye are capable of inducing systemic effects in the exposed animals. It is most likely that these effects are achieved after penetration of the skin barrier. King Saud University, Saudi Arabia; Project No. (Zoo/ 24 - 25 / 05) ...|$|E

Forty-seven dye intermedi-ates commonly used in cosmetic formulations have thus been analyzed by RP-HPLC, and their chromato-graphic characteristics have been recorded. Since the matrix compounds could interfere with the quantitative analysis of the active compounds, eighteen matrix compounds commonly used in cosmetic formulations have been tested for their influence on dye intermediate determination. Since some of them do affect the chromatographic behavior of the dye intermediates, an isolation procedure, for separating matrix compo-nents from the dye-forming compounds, consisting of a liquid-liquid extraction by n-heptane, has been set up. In most cases, this procedure is effective for the extraction of the matrix products. Moreover, the dye intermediates are not extracted by n-heptane, and their chromatographic behavior is not altered by the extraction procedure.

40|$|The colour-fading of hair {{treated with}} {{oxidative}} dyes {{is attributed to}} the effects of ultraviolet light and other environmental factors, but mostly it occurs during shampooing. This effect is caused by the diffusion of chromaphores from within the cortex towards the cuticle surface. The colour fading of dyed hair during shampoo washing is determined by a range of factors, most significantly by the chemistry of the chromaphores, the porosity of the hair fibres, and the properties of the used surfactants. Optimising the cleansing efficacy of shampoos in relation to colour protection claims is of interest to formulators. This study investigates the effects of two co-surfactants and a range of conditioning additives, polycationic and silicone-based, on the colour fading of hair tresses treated with red <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> and put through repeated wash-and-dry cycles. The results indicate that the choice of co-surfactant alone, and in combination with the conditioning additives, can significantly influence the colour fading of red oxidative dye treated hair during shampooing. The amphoteric co-surfactant offered statistically significant improved colour retention, compared to the nonionic. Furthermore, the silicone based conditioning additive delivered enhanced colour retention in comparison with the selected cationic polymers...|$|E
40|$|In the {{organism}} of mammals, important detoxification pathways of arylamines are catalysed by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT 2). A recent case-control epidemiology study suggested that human NAT 2 slow acetylators exposed to oxidative hair dyes {{may be at}} greater risk to develop bladder cancer. We therefore profiled urinary [14 C]-metabolites and NAT 2 genotype in eight human subjects following treatment with a dark-shade <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> containing [14 C]-para-phenylenediamine (PPD). Genotyping identified three subjects as slow, and five subjects as intermediate NAT 2 acetylators. Within 24 h after treatment, the study subjects excreted a mean total of 0. 43 ± 0. 24 % of the applied [14 C] in the urine, where five different metabolites were found. The major urinary metabolites were concluded to be N-mono-acetylated and N,N′-diacetylated PPD. They were present in all urine samples and amounted to 80 - 95 % of the total urinary [14 C]. Another metabolite, possibly a glucuronic acid conjugate, was found in 6 / 8 urine samples at 5 - 13 % of the total urinary [14 C]. All metabolites appeared {{to be related to}} PPD, no evidence of the presence of high-molecular weight dye-intermediates or corresponding metabolites was found. The metabolite profile in the study subjects showed {{no significant differences between the}} NAT 2 intermediate and NAT 2 slow acetylator subgroups. Urine of NAT 2 slow acetylators contained N-mono-acetylated-PPD at 42. 2 ± 10. 2 % and N,N′-di- acetylated-PPD at 54. 1 ± 7. 6 % of total urinary radioactivity, while the corresponding values of intermediate acetylators were 46. 0 ± 8. 9 % and 45. 7 ± 9. 9 %, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that the human acetylation rate of PPD after topical application is independent of the NAT 2 genotype status, most likely due to metabolism by epidermal NAT 1 prior to systemic absorption. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The hair of eight male volunteers was cut to a standard length, dyed, washed, dried, clipped and collected. Hair, washing water, materials used in the study and a 24 -h scalp wash were collected for determination of radioactivity. Blood, urine and faeces were analysed up to 120 h after <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing.</b> An identical [14 C]-PPD-containing <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> formulation was applied in vitro for 0. 5 h to human and pig ear skin, and radioactivity was determined in skin compartments after 24 h. In humans, the recovery rate was 95. 7 ± 1. 5 % of the applied radioactivity. Washing water, cut hair, gloves, paper towels, caps or scalp wash contained a total of 95. 16 ± 1. 46 % of the applied [14 C]. Absorbed radioactivity amounted to 0. 50 ± 0. 24 % in the urine and 0. 04 ± 0. 04 % in the faeces, corresponding to a mean of 7. 0 ± 3. 4 mg [14 C]-PPD-equivalents absorbed. Within 24 h after application, most of the radioactivity was eliminated. The Cmax of [14 C]-PPD-equivalents in the plasma was 0. 087 μgeq/ml, the Tmax was approximately 2 h, and the mean the AUC 0 - 12 h was 0. 67 μgeqh/ml. In vitro tests in human or pig skin found total absorbed amounts of 2. 4 ± 1. 6 % (10. 6 ± 6. 7 μgeq/cm 2) or 3. 4 ± 1. 7 % (14. 6 ± 6. 9 μgeq/cm 2), respectively. Percentage-based in vitro results were considerably higher than corresponding in vivo data, whereas, in units of μg/cm 2, they corresponded to a total absorbed amount of 7. 40 or 10. 22 mgeq for human or pig skin, respectively.

3000|$|... para-Phenylendiamine (PPD) and its ring-methylated analogue, para-toluenediamine (PTD), are primary {{intermediates}} (precursors) for azo dye synthesis. Particularly, {{they are}} used in <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> formulations and in henna tattoo inks. In the hair coloration process, the final permanent color develops during complex chemical reactions {{in the presence of}} an oxidant, e.g., hydrogen peroxide, and a coupler, e.g., resorcinol (benzene- 1, 3 -diol). PPD is well known as the most important allergen associated with hair dye-related allergic contact dermatitis. PPD acts as a pre- or pro-hapten. It is (aut)oxidatively transformed into haptens, e.g., benzoquinone diimine, benzoquinone, or Bandrowski’s Base. In the presence of adequate amounts of couplers, some haptens, e.g., Bandrowski’s Base, are not formed, and others, e.g., benzoquinone diimine, are converted into non-sensitizing products, e.g., the desired dye. Under toxicological aspects, the illegal use of henna tattoo inks containing aryldiamines but no couplers is of high concern. Nevertheless, even during hair coloration at comparably high coupler concentration, the aryldiamines are not completely scavenged and transformed by the couplers. To understand and to assess the reactive and toxicological potential of PPD and PTD, a sound knowledge of their (aut)oxidation reactions and of the nature of formed intermediates and (by)products is crucial. Thus, this review pursues the aim to provide a synopsis of the current state of knowledge of (aut)oxidative reactions of PPD and PTD {{in the absence of a}} coupler. Monomeric and oligomeric reaction products of each compound are presented together with the reaction conditions and analytical techniques applied for their generation and identification. Analytical data of these transformation products, e.g., electrochemical potentials, UV/VIS absorbance maxima, and mass spectrometric data, are tabulated. The certainty of the substance identification is rated with respect to the performance of the applied analytical techniques, to the concordance of results achieved by different methods, and to the traceability of the analytical procedure. Reaction pathways are outlined for both compounds. An integrated reaction scheme is drawn for PPD. Finally, intrinsic difficulties of process and product elucidation are discussed, and some conclusions are drawn pointing to several knowledge gaps and to new analytical approaches, potentially helpful to fill them.|$|E
40|$|Background Chemical products, {{cosmetics}} {{and other products}} handled by consumers and workers frequently contain contact allergens (skin sensitizers). Contact allergens are low-molecular substances which may induce contact allergy (Type IV allergy) after contact with skin. 15 - 20 % of adults are allergic {{to one or more}} of the most common contact allergens, which can cause allergic contact dermatitis (eczema) on any part of the body, although the hands and face are the most common sites. Contact allergy is a lifelong condition, requiring avoidance of further skin exposure to the allergen, in order to minimize the risk of developing contact dermatitis. Aim The main aim of this thesis project was to contribute to a scientific basis for preventive measures to reduce contact allergy and dermatitis. Skin sensitizing hair dye substances and preservatives in products frequently used by consumers were of special concern. Methods In study I and II, we assessed the occurrence and use pattern of skin sensitizing hair dye substances in hair dye products available to consumers in one Northern European country and one Southern European country, based on ingredient labeling. In study III, we examined if typographical design and the order of the list of ingredients could improve the readability of product ingredient labels. This was done by comparing the readability of original product labels versus alternative formats we developed, using several quantitative and qualitative measures. Study IV was an experimental clinical study, repeated open application test (ROAT), in which we examined whether permissible concentrations of the preservative methylisothiazolinone (MI) in cosmetic rinse-off products had the potential to elicit allergic contact dermatitis. Main findings In study I and II we showed that many different potent skin sensitizing hair dye substances are commonly used in <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> products on the market and the products contain a “cocktail” of these sensitizers.

Because subjects sensitized to PPD {{are at risk of}} clinically severe reactions upon <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing,</b> {{there is a need for}} 'current' prevalence data on PPD sensitization. OBJECTIVES: To compare PPD patch test results from dermatitis patients tested between 2003 and 2007 in 10 European patch test centres and to analyse the causes and determine relevance of positive PPD patch test reactions. MATERIALS: Patch testing was performed using PPD (1 % free base in petrolatum from Trolab (Almirall Hermal GmbH, Reinbeck, Germany) or Chemotechnique (Malmö, Sweden), equivalent to 0. 090 mg/cm(2) in the TRUE test from MEKOS Laboratories AS). Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-squared test. RESULTS: The weighted average prevalence was 4. 6 % among 21 515 patients. PPD sensitization occurred more often in centres located in Central and Southern Europe than in Scandinavian centres (odds ratio = 2. 40; 95 % confidence interval = 2. 07 - 2. 78). The overall proportion of positive patch test reactions to PPD that were registered as being of either current or 'past' relevance was high (weighted average 53. 6 % and 20. 3 %, respectively). Consumer <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing</b> was the most prominent cause of PPD sensitization (weighted average 41. 8 %). Furthermore, occupational <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> exposure (10. 6 %) and cross-sensitization to textile dyes (12. 6 %) were frequently reported.

In this frame, we validated a candidate reference method that enables the identification and quantification of hair dye-forming compounds. This method consists of a separation by RP-HPLC coupled with a DAD after a liquid-liquid extraction procedure for separating matrix components from the dye-forming compounds. The validation of the method includes common criteria such as the repeatability of the analysis and the establishment of figures of merit, as well as statistical evaluations and quality assurance in order to follow the recommendations of the Eurachem guide for analytical measurements...|$|R

Eighteen professional hairdressers (3 /day) coloured hairdresser's training heads bearing natural human hair (hair length: approximately 30 cm) for 6 h/working day with a dark-shade <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> containing 2 % [14 C]-para-phenylenediamine (PPD). Three separate phases of hair dyeing were monitored: (A) dye preparation/hair dyeing, (B) rinsing/shampooing/conditioning and (C) cutting/drying/styling. Ambient air and personal monitoring samples (vapours and particles), nasal and hand rinses were collected during all study phases. Urine (pre-exposure, quantitative samples for the 0 - 12, 12 - 24, 24 - 48 h periods after start of exposure) and blood samples (blank, 4, 8 or 24 h) were collected from all exposed subjects. Radioactivity was determined in all biological samples and study materials, tools and washing liquids, and a [14 C]-mass balance was performed daily. No adverse events were noted during the study. Waste, equipment, gloves and coveralls contained 0. 41 ± 0. 16 %, dye mixing bowls 2. 88 ± 0. 54 %, hair wash 45. 47 ± 2. 95 %, hair + scalp 53. 46 ± 4. 06 % of the applied radioactivity, respectively. Plasma levels were below the limit of quantification (≤ 10 ng PPDeq/mL). Total urinary 0 - 48 h excretion of [14 C] levels ranged from a total of < 2 - 18 μg PPDeq and was similar in subjects exposed during the different phases of hair dyeing. Minimal air levels at or slightly above the limit of quantification were found in a few personal air monitoring samples during the phases of hair dyeing and hair cutting, but not during the rinsing phase. Air area monitoring samples or nasal rinses contained no measurable radioactivity. Hand residues ranged from 0. 006 to 0. 15 μg PPDeq/cm 2, and were found predominantly after the cutting/drying phase. The mean mass balance of [14 C] across the six study days was 102. 50 ± 2. 20 %. Overall, the mean, total systemic exposure of hairdressers to oxidative hair dyes during a working day including 6 hair dyeing processes {{was estimated to be}} < 0. 36 μg PPDeq/kg body weight/working day. Our results suggest that (a) current safety precautions for the handling of hair dyes offer sufficient protection against local and systemic exposure and (b) professional exposure to oxidative hair dyes does not pose a risk to human health. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|As aryldiamines, PPD, PTD, {{and their}} {{transformation}} products are of toxicological and environmental concern. They are assessed as toxic [8], mutagenic in vitro [9], and carcinogenic [9 – 11]. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has categorized various phenylenediamines as human carcinogens [12]. In the year 2012, the “Permanent Senate Commission for the Investigation of Health Hazards of Chemical Compounds in the Work Area” of the German Research Foundation (DFG) has assessed PPD as a carcinogenic occupational substance (category 3 B) [13]. A specific feature of phenylenediamines, especially of PPD, is their allergic potential [14, 15]. PPD {{is known as}} the most important allergen associated with hair dye-related allergic contact dermatitis [16, 17]. It is a pre- or pro-hapten and converted into several haptens by various (aut)oxidative reactions. With respect to occupational health and consumer health requirements, the usage of PPD and PTD in hair and tattoo dye formulations is subject to various regulations. The European Economic Community Cosmetics Directive has set limit values for the maximal concentration of phenylenediamines in hair dyes to 6  % (PPD) and 10  % (PTD), provided that the active dye formulation contains an excess of coupling compounds [18]. The toxicological potential of technical and commercial formulations of aryldiamines is not only coined by the pure compounds themselves but also by side products of their technical synthesis and by chemical (aut)oxidation products formed during post production handling, product formulation, storage, application, or environmental exposure [19]. In contact with air or oxidizing agents like peroxides, phenylenediamines are easily transformed into complex mixtures of monomeric, dimeric, oligomeric, and polymeric oxidation products. Furthermore, the amines might undergo photolytic or photooxidative degradation when exposed to sunlight [20, 21]. In properly composed <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> formulations, the aryldiamines are efficiently converted into the desired permanent dye by reaction with the coupler component avoiding the formation of toxic byproducts, e.g., Bandrowski’s Base [2, 22]. Nevertheless, even under those conditions, the aryldiamines are not completely scavenged and consumed by the couplers so that a certain reactivity potential might persist. Consequently, henna tattoo coloration formulations containing aryldiamines, e.g., PPD, without a coupler, are of high toxicological concern, since under those conditions, potentially mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds are formed by autoxidation processes of the diaminobenzenes. The current status of the PPD risk assessment is briefly summarized in [23]. Thus, a final evaluation of the toxic properties and environmental behavior of phenylenediamines requires an in-depth knowledge of their transformation products formed under the respective conditions.|$|E

Chapter 1 presents a short review of the most relevant syntheses of these compounds. Most commonly, they are synthesized by cycloaddition reactions. Chapter 2 presents a short review of the applications of the pyrrolo[1, 2 -b]pyrazines as biologically active compounds and as highly fluorescent materials used in LEDs. They can be used as both couplers and developers in <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing</b> compositions. It also has been shown that they could be synthesized efficiently through a 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition reaction between the corresponding pyridazine derivatives and the appropriate alkyne. Chapter 3 presents a short review of the application of the pyrazolo[1, 5 -a]pyridines as biologically active compounds. Some derivatives even reached the clinical trial phase and they are still under development. Amino substituted pyrazolo[1, 5 -a]pyridine derivatives {{have been found to be}} suitable for use as oxidation bases. It also has been shown that they can be synthesized by the similar 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition reaction as pyrrolo[1, 2 -b]pyridazinse. Syntheses involve the almost exclusive use of N-aminopyridinium salts and often require the generation of ylides.

Background: p-Phenylenediamine (PDA) or its related {{chemicals}} are used more extensively than <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> However, permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> such as PDA {{are known to}} have potent contact allergy reactions in humans, and severe allergic reactions are problematic. Methods: PDA-incorporated nanoparticles were prepared based on ion-complex formation between the cationic groups of PDA and the anionic groups of poly(&gamma;-glutamic acid) (PGA). To reinforce PDA/PGA ion complexes, glycol chitosan (GC) was added. PDA-incorporated nanoparticles were characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD). Results: Nanoparticles were formed by ion-complex formation between the amine groups of PDA and the carboxyl groups of PGA. PDA-incorporated nanoparticles are small in size (&lt; 100 nm), and morphological observations showed spherical shapes. FT-IR spectra results showed that the carboxylic acid peak of PGA decreased with increasing PDA content, indicating that the ion complexes were formed between the carboxyl groups of PGA and the amine groups of PDA. Furthermore, the intrinsic peak of the carboxyl groups of PGA was also decreased by the addition of GC. Intrinsic crystalline peaks of PDA were observed by XRD. This crystalline peak of PDA was completely nonexistent when nanoparticles were formed by ion complex between PDA, PGA, and GC, indicating that PDA was complexed with PGA and no free drug existed in the formulation. During the drug-release experiment, an initial burst release of PDA was observed, and then PDA was continuously released over 1 week. Cytotoxicity testing against HaCaT human skin keratinocyte cells showed PDA-incorporated nanoparticles had lower toxicity than PDA itself. Furthermore, PDA-incorporated nanoparticles showed reduced apoptosis and necrosis reaction at HaCaT cells. Conclusion: The authors suggest that these microparticles are ideal candidates for a vehicle for decreasing side effects of <b>hair</b> <b>dye.</b> Keywords: p-phenylenediamine, keratinocyte, PDA, PG...|$|R
40|$|Background: N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT 1) {{mediated}} Nacetylation {{in human}} skin and keratinocytes {{is an important}} detoxification pathway for aromatic amines including the strong sensitizer para-phenylenediamine (PPD), {{an important component of}} <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> Objectives: Human skin and keratinocytes have high Nacetylation capacities, however the localization of NAT 1 in the epidermis and the influence differentiation on NAT 1 is not clear. NAT 1 expression and cell proliferation were suggested to be associated in breast and prostate cells, which prompted us to analyze NAT 1 in skin and proliferating versus differentiated keratinocytes. Methods: HaCaT and primary keratinocytes (NHEK, five donors) were in vitro differentiated using calcium and differentiation was confirmed by increased Keratin 1, Keratin 10 and Transglutaminase 1 mRNA expression detected by real-time PCR. NAT 1 activities were detected in cell lysates and conversion of PPD to its acetylated derivatives was analyzed in cell culture supernatants by HPLC. NAT 1 expression in cryosections of human skin obtained from mamma reductions were detected using fluorescent staining with anti-NAT 1 primary antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. Results: In vitro differentiation of keratinocyte did not alter NAT 1 activities, which varied between 21. 1 ± 4 and 26. 2 ± 3 nmol/mg/min in HaCaT and 7 ± 0. 6 and 5. 9 ± 0. 6 nmol/mg/min in NHEK. Formation of acetylated PPD was demonstrated in supernatants of proliferating as well as differentiated keratinocytes. In keratinocytes an increased conversion of PPD to acetylated derivatives was seen. In healthy human skin staining against NAT 1 showed granular staining of the cytosol of the basal layers of keratinocytes. Conclusions: NAT 1 expression was demonstrated in human epidermis and overall N-acetylation capacity and consequently detoxification capacitieswas not reduced during in vitro keratinocyte differentiation. NAT 1 is expressed in a granular pattern in the cytoplasmic matrix of basal keratinocytes. It could be hypothesized that NAT 1 is present in cytosolic vesicles.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this Ph. D project was to study the role of transition metal ions in <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> colouring. Model systems corresponding to real-life hair colouring conditions were designed to examine copper(II) and iron(III) catalysed decomposition of alkaline hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical formation. In a chelant-free system, copper(II) ions were more active in decomposing alkaline hydrogen peroxide compared to iron(III) ions. For copper(II) ions, the initial rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical formation increased {{with an increase in}} initial concentration of copper(II) ions. Adding chelants to the reaction solution altered the catalytic activity of metal ions. EDTA and EDDS chelants with iron(III) generated more hydroxyl radical and decomposed higher amounts of hydrogen peroxide than the corresponding complexes of these chelants with copper(II) ions. Most studied chelants supressed catalytic activity of copper(II) ions except HEDP chelant which rapidly decomposed hydrogen peroxide. The results highlight that different metal-chelant systems have different level of catalytic activity in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Adding large excess of calcium ions to the reaction solution influenced the binding of copper(II) ions. Unlike other chelants, only EDDS showed selective binding of copper(II) ions in the presence of calcium and suppressed the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Similar results were obtained for copper treated hair fibres, where EDDS again showed strong preference and selectivity for copper(II). This suggests that EDDS is the best chelant to control free radical mediated protein <b>hair</b> damage during <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> colouring. The selectivity of EDDS chelant was explained using speciation plots. Catalytic activity of copper(II) ions was also examined in the presence of aromatic dye precursors. PPD/MAP combination suppressed decomposition of alkaline hydrogen peroxide which suggests that <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing</b> is likely to induce less protein damage to hair as compared to the bleaching systems. It is believed that some unknown intermediates are formed which chelate copper catalysts changing their chemical activity. Among the chelants examined in the current study, HEDP is an exception as its mixture with copper(II) ions led to rapid decomposition of alkaline hydrogen peroxide and showed a very unusual kinetic profile. A mechanistic study showed that the decomposition reaction proceeds via formation of an active catalyst that degrades the chelant and eventually seeds formation of catalytically-inactive basic copper phosphate/carbonate nanoparticles. The nanoparticles prevent any further catalytic reaction as freshly added Cu 2 + ions quickly adsorb on their surface and do not form active catalyst. In a separate study, human hair samples were analysed to quantify the amount of calcium carbonate present in the bubble shaped structures lying over the hair shaft. SEM Images were analysed to estimate the amount of material present while quantitative gas IR analysis showed that the amount of calcium carbonate increased with increasing bubble count level. Calcium carbonate found by IR analysis was less than the values estimated by image analysis which suggested that calcium carbonate may not be the only material present in the bubble and some other unknown material may also be present...|$|R
