An <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> is an instrument capable of manipulating microscopic particles using the inherent momen-tum of light. First introduced by Askin et al. [1], the single beam gradient <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> is capable of generating small forces (∼ 1 – 100 pN) in a noninvasive manner. As a result, the <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> is often used to manipulate biological specimen.

A method of using adaptive techniques for system identification and calibration is also presented. This research has the potential to use forces and torques to affect our understanding of the mechanics of single molecules and motor proteins.

25|$|When {{a cluster}} of microparticles are trapped within a {{monochromatic}} laser beam, {{the organization of the}} microparticles within the <b>optical</b> <b>trapping</b> is heavily dependent on the redistributing of the <b>optical</b> <b>trapping</b> forces amongst the microparticles. This redistribution of light forces amongst the cluster of microparticles provides a new force equilibrium on the cluster as a whole. As such we can say that the cluster of microparticles are somewhat bound together by light. One of the first experimental evidence of optical binding was reported by Michael M. Burns, Jean-Marc Fournier, and Jene A. Golovchenko, though it was originally predicted by T. Thirunamachandran. One of the many recent studies on optical binding has shown that for a system of chiral nanoparticles, the magnitude of the binding forces are dependent on the polarisation of the laser beam and the handedness of interacting particles themselves, with potential applications in areas such as enantiomeric separation and optical nanomanipulation.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the authors}} of this seminal 1986 paper, former United States Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, would go on to use optical tweezing in his work on cooling and {{trapping}} neutral atoms.

In an interview, Steven Chu described how Ashkin had first envisioned optical tweezing as a method for trapping atoms. Ashkin was able to trap larger particles (10 to 10,000 nanometers in diameter) but it fell to Chu to extend these techniques to the trapping of neutral atoms (0.1 nanometers in diameter) utilizing resonant laser light and a magnetic gradient trap (cf. Magneto-optical trap).|$|E
40|$|The trap length {{along the}} beam axis for an <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> formed with an upright, oil-immersion {{microscope}} was measured. The goals for this effort were twofold. It was deemed useful {{to understand the}} depth to which an <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> can reach for purposes of developing a tool {{to assist in the}} fabrication of miniature devices. Additionally, it was desired to know whether the measured trap length favored {{one or the other of}} two competing theories to model an <b>optical</b> <b>trap.</b> The approach was to trap a microsphere of known size and mass and raise it from its initial trap position. The microsphere was then dropped by blocking the laser beam for a pre-determined amount of time. Dropping the microsphere in a free-fall mode from various heights relative to the coverslip provides an estimate of how the trapping length changes with depth in water in a sample chamber on a microscope slide. While it was not possible to measure the trap length with sufficient precision to support any particular theory of <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> formation, it was possible to find regions where the presence of physical boundaries influenced <b>optical</b> <b>traps,</b> and determine that the trap length, for the apparatus studied, is between 6 and 7 m. These results allow more precise control using optical micromanipulation to assemble miniature devices by providing information about the distance over which an <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> is effective...|$|R
40|$|An <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> uses {{radiation}} pressure {{of light to}} manipulate microscopic objects. The interaction between {{the light and the}} microscopic objects result in the objects experiencing optical forces. These forces are on the same order of magnitude as biological forces (typically [range-units=single] 0. 1100) and this feature makes <b>optical</b> <b>traps</b> appropriate for single-molecule studies. Currently, there is a growing need to create an automated <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> that uses the entire operating range of the <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> to study the biological forces. Spatial nonlinearities in the optical force and parameter uncertainty complicate feedback control for <b>optical</b> <b>traps.</b> A consequence is that users are spending an enormous amount of time calibrating the instrument and designing a controller, and this diverts their time away from studying the biophysics. This research explores the use of nonlinear and adaptive feedback methods to create an automated <b>optical</b> <b>trap.</b> A model is defined to describe the coupling between the dynamics of the <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> and molecule, and the nominal force within the molecule is treated as a disturbance. The disturbance information is obtained by creating a disturbance model and combining its dynamics with the system dynamics. The system nonlinearities are addressed by using a nonlinear Kalman filter to estimate the system state, then the system state is used in a input-output feedback linearization and linear quadratic structure to satisfy performacne requirements. Statistical analyses are performed to assess the effectiveness the feedback methods have on the open-loop and closed-loop systems. Its performance is compared with that of linear integral control used in practice to quantify the performance improvement when considering the system nonlinearities in the control design. The system nonlinearities and parameter uncertainty are addressed by using adaptive and nonlinear feedback methods. An adaptive state observer provides a simultaneous estimate of the system state and parameters, then these estimated entities are used in an adaptive input-output feedback linearization and LQ structure. The result is the creation of an automated self-tuning <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> that minimizes the user interaction with the instrument calibration and control design, uses the entire operating range of the <b>optical</b> <b>trap,</b> and obtains an unbiased estimate of the molecule force. The closed-loop performance of these feedback methods are demonstrated by replicating the force-extension curve of a DNA molecule...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>optical</b> <b>traps</b> {{to measure}} or apply {{forces on the}} {{molecular}} level requires a precise knowledge of the trapping force field. Close to the trap center, this field is typically approximated as linear in the displacement of the trapped microsphere. However, applications demanding high forces at low laser intensities can probe the light-microsphere interaction beyond the linear regime. Here, we measured the full nonlinear force and displacement response of an <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> in two dimensions using a dual-beam <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> setup with back-focal-plane photodetection.
