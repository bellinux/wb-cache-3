5|$|The γ ring is narrow, {{optically}} {{dense and}} slightly eccentric. Its orbital inclination is almost zero. The {{width of the}} ring varies in the range 3.6–4.7km, although equivalent <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> is constant at 3.3km. The normal <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> of the γ ring is 0.7–0.9. During a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the γ ring disappeared, which means it is geometrically thin like the ε ring and devoid of dust. The width and normal <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> of the γ ring show significant azimuthal variations.

5|$|The η ring has zero orbital {{eccentricity}} and inclination. Like the δ ring, {{it consists of}} two components: a narrow optically dense component and a broad outward shoulder with low <b>optical</b> <b>depth.</b> The width of the narrow component is 1.9–2.7km and the equivalent depth is about 0.42km, which corresponds to the normal <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> of about 0.16–0.25. The broad component is about 40km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0.85km, indicating a low normal <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> of 2×10−2. It was resolved in Voyager 2 images. In forward-scattered light, the η ring looked bright, which indicated {{the presence of a}} considerable amount of dust in this ring, probably in the broad component. The broad component is much thicker (geometrically) than the narrow one. This conclusion is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007, when the η ring demonstrated increased brightness, becoming the second brightest feature in the ring system. This is consistent with the behavior of a geometrically thick but simultaneously optically thin ring. Like the majority of other rings, the η ring shows significant azimuthal variations in the normal <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> and width. The narrow component even vanishes in some places.|$|E
5|$|The λ {{ring was}} one of two rings {{discovered}} by Voyager 2 in 1986. It is a narrow, faint ring located just inside the ε ring, between it and the shepherd moon Cordelia. This moon clears a dark lane just inside the λ ring. When viewed in back-scattered light, the λ ring is extremely narrow—about 1–2km—and has the equivalent <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> 0.1–0.2km at the wavelength 2.2μm. The normal <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> is 0.1–0.2. The <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> of the λ ring shows strong wavelength dependence, which is atypical for the Uranian ring system. The equivalent depth is as high as 0.36km in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, which explains why λ ring was initially detected only in UV stellar occultations by Voyager 2. The detection during a stellar occultation at the wavelength 2.2μm was only announced in 1996.|$|E
40|$|An {{airborne}} Sun photometer {{was used}} to measure <b>optical</b> <b>depths</b> in clear atmospheres between the appearances of broken stratus clouds, and the <b>optical</b> <b>depths</b> in the vicinity of smokes.

5|$|The {{appearance}} of the λ ring changed dramatically when it was observed in forward-scattered light in 1986. In this geometry the ring became the brightest feature of the Uranian ring system, outshining the ε ring. This observation, together with the wavelength dependence of the <b>optical</b> <b>depth,</b> indicates that the λ ring contains significant amount of micrometer-sized dust. The normal <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> of this dust is 10−4–10−3. Observations in 2007 by the Keck telescope during the ring plane-crossing event confirmed this conclusion, because the λ ring {{became one of the}} brightest features in the Uranian ring system.|$|E
5|$|The δ ring is {{circular}} {{and slightly}} inclined. It shows significant unexplained azimuthal variations in normal <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> and width. One {{possible explanation is}} that the ring has an azimuthal wave-like structure, excited by a small moonlet just inside it. The sharp outer edge of the δ ring is in 23:22 resonance with Cordelia. The δ ring consists of two components: a narrow optically dense component and a broad inward shoulder with low <b>optical</b> <b>depth.</b> The width of the narrow component is 4.1–6.1km and the equivalent depth is about 2.2km, which corresponds to a normal <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> of about 0.3–0.6. The ring's broad component is about 10–12km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0.3km, indicating a low normal <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> of 3×10−2. This is known only from occultation data because Voyager 2's imaging experiment failed to resolve the δ ring. When observed in forward-scattering geometry by Voyager 2, the δ ring appeared relatively bright, which is compatible with the presence of dust in its broad component. The broad component is geometrically thicker than the narrow component. This is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007, when the δ ring remained visible, which is consistent with the behavior of a simultaneously geometrically thick and optically thin ring.|$|E
5|$|The ζ {{ring was}} {{observed}} {{again during the}} ring plane-crossing event in 2007 when it became the brightest feature of the ring system, outshining all other rings combined. The equivalent <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> of this ring is near 1km (0.6km for the inward extension), while the normal <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> is again less than 10−3. Rather different appearances of the 1986U2R and ζ rings {{may be caused by}} different viewing geometries: back-scattering geometry in 2003–2007 and side-scattering geometry in 1986. However, changes during the past 20 years in the distribution of dust, which is thought to predominate in the ring, cannot be ruled out.|$|E
40|$|A new {{procedure}} for calculating Rayleigh scattering cross sections and <b>optical</b> <b>depths</b> {{has been developed}} {{for use in the}} solar radiation transfer model of the LLNL Chemistry-Radiation-Transport Models. This procedure replaces the previous method for determining the <b>optical</b> <b>depths</b> in which the parameterization of Hansen and Travis (1974) was used to generate a table of <b>optical</b> <b>depths</b> for wavelengths ranging from 0. 135 {mu}m to 0. 729 {mu}m; the table was then placed directly in the shortwave package. Hansen and Travis calculate Rayleigh scattering <b>optical</b> <b>depths,</b> {tau}, using {tau} = 0. 08569 {lambda}{sup {minus} 4 } (1 + 0. 0113 {lambda}{sup {minus} 2 } + 0. 00013 {lambda}{sup {minus} 4 }) where {lambda} is wavelength in {mu}m and the standard surface pressure is 1013 mB. The new scheme uses instead the parameterization of Nicolet (1984) to find the Rayleigh scattering cross sections for an arbitrary set of wavelength bins, and from these cross sections, determines the <b>optical</b> <b>depths.</b> The Nicolet parameterization was recommended by the WMO (1986), and calculates Rayleigh scattering cross sections using O{sub RS} = 4. 02 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 28 }/{lambda}{sup {minus}}(4 + x) where x= 0. 389 {lambda} + 0. 09426 /{lambda}- 0. 3328 for {lambda} 0. 55 {mu}m...|$|R

At <b>optical</b> <b>depths</b> {{greater than or equal}} to 1, both smokes showed neutral wavelength dependence, similar to that of an optically thin stratus deck.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 1986U2R/ζ and λ rings, there are other extremely faint dust bands in the Uranian ring system. They are invisible during occultations because they have negligible <b>optical</b> <b>depth,</b> though they are bright in forward-scattered light. Voyager 2s images of forward-scattered light revealed the existence of bright dust bands between the λ and δ rings, between the η and β rings, and between the α ring and ring 4. Many of these bands were detected again in 2003–2004 by the Keck Telescope and during the 2007 ring-plane crossing event in backscattered light, but their precise locations and relative brightnesses were different from during the Voyager observations. The normal <b>optical</b> <b>depth</b> of the dust bands is about 10−5 or less. The dust particle size distribution is thought to obey a power law with the index p=2.5±0.5.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the dust bands is less problematic. The dust has a very short lifetime, 100–1000 years, and should be {{continuously}} replenished by collisions between larger ring particles, moonlets and meteoroids from outside the Uranian system. The belts of the parent moonlets and particles are themselves invisible due to their low <b>optical</b> <b>depth,</b> while the dust reveals itself in forward-scattered light. The narrow main rings and the moonlet belts that create dust bands are expected to differ in particle size distribution. The main rings have more centimeter to meter-sized bodies. Such a distribution increases the surface area of the material in the rings, leading to high optical density in back-scattered light. In contrast, the dust bands have relatively few large particles, which results in low <b>optical</b> <b>depth.</b>|$|E

Higher spectral <b>optical</b> <b>depths</b> were observed in the coastal regions and over southern latitudes compared to interior continental regions and northern latitudes. The <b>optical</b> <b>depths,</b> size index "?" and the near surface aerosol mass concentrations indicate a relative abundance of nucleation mode aerosols in the northern latitudes, {{in contrast to the}} dominance of the accumulation mode aerosols at the eastern coastal and southern latitudes. The airmass pathways derived from the back trajectory analysis indicate that the higher aerosol population in the accumulation mode, and consequently the higher <b>optical</b> <b>depths</b> in the southern locations, could be due to the transport of aerosol from the polluted north Indian regions via the oceanic region over the Bay of Bengal, where significant particle growth is expected, increasing the population of accumulation mode aerosols over these regions...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{atmospheric}} aerosols and regional haze from air pollution on the yields {{of rice and}} winter wheat grown in China is assessed. The assessment is based on estimates of aerosol <b>optical</b> <b>depths</b> over China, {{the effect of these}} <b>optical</b> <b>depths</b> on the solar irradiance reaching the earth’s surface, and the response of rice and winter wheat grown in Nanjing to the change in solar irradiance. Two sets of aerosol <b>optical</b> <b>depths</b> are presented: one based on a coupled, regional climate/air quality model simulation and the other inferred from solar radiation measurements made over a 12 -year period at meteorological stations in China. The model-estimated <b>optical</b> <b>depths</b> are significantly smaller than those derived from observations, perhaps because of errors in one or both sets of <b>optical</b> <b>depths</b> or because the data from the meteorological stations has been affected by local pollution. Radiative transfer calculations using the smaller, model-estimated aerosol <b>optical</b> <b>depths</b> indicate that the so-called “direct effect” of regional haze results in an ≈ 5 – 30 % reduction in the solar irradiance reaching some of China’s most productive agricultural regions. Crop-response model simulations suggest an ≈ 1 : 1 relationship between a percentage increase (decrease) in total surface solar irradiance and a percentage increase (decrease) in the yields of rice and wheat. Collectively, these calculations suggest that regional haze in China is currently depressing optimal yields of ≈ 70 % of the crops grown in China by at least 5 – 30 %. Reducing the severity of regional haze in China through air pollution control could potentially result in a significant increase in crop yields and help the nation meet its growing food demands in the coming decades...|$|R

40|$|Cloud <b>optical</b> <b>depths</b> {{have been}} {{measured}} using multifilter rotating shadowband radiometers (MFRSRs) at Barrow and Atqasuk, and liquid water paths have been measured at Barrow using a microwave radiometer (MWR) during the warm season (June-September) in 1999.

This period varied between 18 hours in June and 6 hours in September. Preliminary results indicate that, for measured cloud <b>optical</b> <b>depths</b> less than approximately 25, the ECMWF has a low bias in its predictions, consistent with a low bias in predicted liquid water path. Based on a more limited set of data, the <b>optical</b> <b>depths</b> at Atqasuk {{were found to be}} generally lower than those at Barrow, a trend at least qualitatively captured by the ECMWF model.

Uniquely, the Adams ring includes five distinct arcs, named Fraternité, Égalité 1 and 2, Liberté, and Courage. The arcs occupy a narrow range of orbital longitudes and are remarkably stable, having changed only slightly since their initial detection in 1980. How the arcs are stabilized is still under debate. However, their stability is probably related to the resonant interaction between the Adams ring and its inner shepherd moon, Galatea.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{location}} of the upper two cloud layers is somewhat controversial. Methane clouds were directly detected by Voyager 2 at 1.2–1.3bar by radio occultation.
