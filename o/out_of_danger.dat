5|$|Santa Cecilia, {{under the}} command of Captain Don Ramon de Chalas, had {{meanwhile}} sat in Puerto Cabello until Captain Edward Hamilton, aboard , cut her out of the harbour on 25 October 1799. Hamilton led a boarding party to retake Hermione and, after an exceptionally bloody action, sailed her <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger</b> under Spanish gunfire. The Spanish casualties included 119 dead; the British took 231 Spaniards prisoner, while another 15 jumped or fell overboard. Hamilton had 11 men injured, four seriously, but none killed. Hamilton himself was severely wounded.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Pulo Aura {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} of the Napoleonic Wars, fought on 14 February 1804, in which a large convoy of Honourable East India Company (HEIC) East Indiamen, well-armed merchant ships, intimidated, drove off and chased a powerful French naval squadron. Although the French force was much stronger than the British convoy, Commodore Nathaniel Dance's aggressive tactics persuaded Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois to retire after only a brief exchange of shot. Dance then chased the French warships until his convoy was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger,</b> whereupon he resumed his passage towards British India. Linois later claimed that the unescorted British merchant fleet was defended by eight ships of the line, a claim criticised by contemporary officers and later historians.|$|E
5|$|There are few native natural predators of emus still alive. Early in its species history it {{may have}} faced {{numerous}} terrestrial predators now extinct, including the giant lizard Megalania, the thylacine, and possibly other carnivorous marsupials, which may explain their seemingly well-developed ability to defend themselves from terrestrial predators. The main predator of emus today is the dingo, which was originally introduced by Aboriginals {{thousands of years ago}} from a stock of semi-domesticated wolves. Dingoes try to kill the emu by attacking the head. The emu typically tries to repel the dingo by jumping into the air and kicking or stamping the dingo on its way down. The emu jumps as the dingo barely has the capacity to jump high enough to threaten its neck, so a correctly timed leap to coincide with the dingo's lunge can keep its head and neck <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger.</b>|$|E

5|$|Brézé, {{unable to}} {{dispatch}} his fireships over the Spanish vessels, {{as he had}} done in his previous battles at Cádiz, Barcelona and Cartagena, lunged over Pimienta's galleon Santiago and riddled the ship with his artillery Santiago lost its main-mast and had to be succored by Linhares and Pablo de Contreras. Fearing the attack of the French fireships or the boarding of Brézé's galleys, Contreras covered the damaged galleon at the head of six vessels, while Linhares flag galley towed it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger.</b> The remaining ships engaged Brézé in an inconclusive action which lasted until both fleets separated at dusk. The Spanish lost the frigate Santa Catalina, burnt by its own crew to avoid capture when she was surrounded by the French la Mazarine and three other vessels. The foremost Spanish galleons Testa de Oro, León Rojo and Caballo marino received heavy damage, while a French fireship blew up. Two French galleons were also badly damaged. The human loss aboard the Spanish fleet is unknown. Forty men were killed or wounded aboard the French fleet One of them was Admiral Brézé, cut in half by a cannonball which hit the stern of his flagship Grand Saint Louis.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{coronation}} {{had originally}} been scheduled for 26 June 1902. However, two days before, on 24 June, {{he was diagnosed with}} appendicitis. Appendicitis was generally not treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate, but developments in anaesthesia and antisepsis in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible. Sir Frederick Treves, with the support of Lord Lister, performed a then-radical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected abscess through a small incision (through -inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall); this outcome showed thankfully that the cause was not cancer. The next day, Edward was sitting up in bed, smoking a cigar. Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger.</b> Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which Edward had arranged before the operation) and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream. Edward was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who died only four months later.|$|E
5|$|The British fleet was {{anchored}} off The Rock on 10December 1796 when a storm blew up. Culloden {{was obliged}} {{to get under way}} when her anchors failed to hold, narrowly missing Pearl Rock in the process, and at 21:00, Gibraltar was forced to cut her cable. As she was attempting to get clear of Cabrita Point at 22:00, her fore topmast snapped and her foresail, mainsail, main topmast staysail, and mizzen staysail tore. Having already lost her main topsail, she became difficult to handle and struck the sandbank several times before being blown across it. By midnight Gibraltar was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger</b> and able to ride out the storm, and the next day at noon she anchored in Tangier Bay. The damage incurred during the storm necessitated her being sent to Plymouth in January 1797. During the repairs, which took until April and cost £12,818, a large piece of rock was removed from her hull. Gibraltar returned to the Mediterranean in July 1797 under Captain William Hancock Kelly.|$|E

5|$|To {{the north}} of this engagement, the trapped Pompée and Hannibal were under heavy fire from the {{anchored}} Formidable {{and an array of}} Spanish batteries and gunboats, both ships taking severe damage without being able to effectively reply as their main broadsides now faced away from the enemy. On Hannibal the situation seemed hopeless: as casualties mounted, the main and mizen masts were shot away and the ship remained firmly and irretrievably grounded. Pompée was in a slightly better position: Sterling's rigging was in tatters, but his masts held and his ship was at least afloat, although totally becalmed. At one stage, Pompées colours were shot away, leading to French claims that the ship had surrendered, although they were quickly replaced. At 11:30, no longer able to contribute to the battle with rigging torn and more than 70 casualties, Saumarez ordered the remainder of the squadron to send their remaining boats to tow Pompée <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger,</b> the boats coming under heavy fire as they did so, with a number sunk.|$|E
5|$|Seeing this inauspicious development, Wrede {{sent his}} cavalry, {{no less than}} 7,000 men, to charge Drouot's grand battery. The steady French {{canister}} fire was devastating and many Coalition squadrons turned back to safety. Some of them did manage {{to get to the}} French guns and crossed the battery, with the Guard cavalry immediately countercharging and driving them off. With the gun line now <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger,</b> Nansouty, with the aid of Sebastiani's cuirassiers launched a pursuit of the repulsed enemy horse, encountering and breaking an Austrian cuirassier regiment, the Knesevich Dragoon regiment and two Bavarian chevaulegers regiments, all under the personal command of Field Marshal-Lieutenant Franz Splény de Miháldy. Then, with a manoeuvre resembling that of Kellermann at Marengo, Nansouty wheeled his men left and rushed onto the enemy infantry, breaking them. The Grenadiers-à-Cheval were {{in the thick of the}} fighting and, with an offensive comeback of the Bavarian cavalry, they were momentarily in a dangerous situation, but were duly rescued by the Gardes d'Honneur regiment. Nansouty then took his entire cavalry and broke the remaining enemy squares and cavalry, pushing some of these men into the Kinzig river. Meanwhile, Nansouty's action left Sebastiani free to silence the Bavarian grand battery, skilfully using Saint-Germain's cuirassier division and Exelmans's light division of his Corps. Nansouty received a light wound during this battle, but his role at Hanau is compared by a Russian author to that of Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz at the Battle of Zorndorf.|$|E
