25|$|In November 1994, CDNow {{launched}} its BuyWeb program. CDNow {{had the idea}} that music-oriented websites could review or list albums on their pages that their visitors might be interested in purchasing. These websites could also offer a link that would take visitors directly to CDNow to purchase the albums. The idea for remote purchasing originally arose from conversations with music label Geffen Records in the fall of 1994. The management at Geffen wanted to sell its artists' CD's directly from its website, but did not want to implement this capability itself. Geffen asked CDNow if it could design a program where CDNow would handle the <b>order</b> <b>fulfillment.</b> Geffen realized that CDNow could link directly from the artist on its website to Geffen's website, bypassing the CDNow home page and going directly to an artist's music page.|$|E
25|$|Target.com {{owns and}} oversees the company's {{e-commerce}} initiatives, {{such as the}} Target.com domain. Founded in early 2000 as target.direct, it was formed by separating the company's existing e-commerce operations from its retailing division and combining it with its Rivertown Trading direct marketing unit into a stand-alone subsidiary. In 2002, target.direct and Amazon.com's subsidiary Amazon Enterprise Solutions created a partnership in which Amazon.com would provide <b>order</b> <b>fulfillment</b> and guest services for Target.com in exchange for fixed and variable fees. After the company sold Marshall Field's and Mervyn's in 2004, target.direct became Target.com. The domain target.com attracted at least 288 million visitors annually by 2008, according to a Compete.com survey. In August 2009, Target announced that they would build and manage a new Target.com platform, independent of Amazon.com. This new platform was to launch in 2011, {{in advance of the}} holiday season. Prior to the announcement, Target and Amazon had extended their partnership until 2011. In January 2010, Target announced their vendor partners for the re-platforming project. These partners include Sapient, IBM, Oracle, Endeca, Autonomy, Sterling Commerce and Huge, among others. The re-platformed Target.com officially launched on August 23, 2011, effectively ending the partnership with Amazon.com.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, an {{analysis}} of the existing <b>order</b> based <b>fulfillment</b> process for one product line of a specialty chemicals manufacturer is made and the potential benefits from the implementation of a vendor managed inventory (VMI) system are quantified. A single facility is considered and our focus is on the possible reductions in transportation effort. Initially, a set of criteria are defined for classifying which storage tanks will be served under the VMI system and which under the existing order based process. Subsequently, a cluster first-route second approach is implemented, where customer locations are first separated into clusters based on geographical proximity and routes are then designed for each of the clusters. A mathematical model is constructed that aids in the design of delivery routes that minimize the total number of delivery trips. Finally, the total transportation effort that would be required for replenishing the VMI and non-VMI tanks is estimated and a comparison is made with the current system. Key performance indicators are compared between the existing <b>order</b> based <b>fulfillment</b> process and the potential VMI implementation. Limitations of the proposed approach are discussed and directions for future research are highlighted. by Dimitrios Andritsos and Anthony Craig. Thesis (M.

40|$|Nowadays, the {{cooperative}} {{intelligent transport systems}} {{are part of a}} largest system. Transportations are modal operations integrated in logistics and, logistics is the main process of the supply chain management. The supply chain strategic management as a simultaneous local and global value chain is a collaborative/cooperative organization of stakeholders, many times in co-opetition, to perform a service to the customers respecting the time, place, price and quality levels. The transportation, like other logistics operations must add value, which is achieved in this case through compression lead times and <b>order</b> <b>fulfillments.</b> The complex supplier's network and the distribution channels must be efficient and the integral visibility (monitoring and tracing) of supply chain is a significant source of competitive advantage. Nowadays, the competition is not discussed between companies but among supply chains. This paper aims to evidence the current and emerging manufacturing and logistics system challenges as a new field of opportunities for the automation and control systems research community. Furthermore, the paper forecasts the use of radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies integrated into an information and communication technologies (ICT) framework based on distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) supported by a multi-agent system (MAS), as the most value advantage of supply chain management (SCM) in a cooperative intelligent logistics systems.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{optimization}} of <b>order</b> due date <b>fulfillment</b> reliability in multi-echelon distribution network problems with uncertainties {{present in the}} production lead time, transportation lead time, and due date of orders. Reliability regarding <b>order</b> due date <b>fulfillment</b> is critical in customer service, and customer retention. However, this reliability can be seriously influenced by supply chain uncertainties, which may induce tardiness in various stages throughout the supply chain. Supply chain uncertainty is inevitable, since most input values are predicted from historical data, and unexpected events may happen. Hence, a multi-criterion genetic integrative optimization methodology is developed for solving this problem. The proposed algorithm integrates genetic algorithms with analytic hierarchy process to enable multi-criterion optimization, and probabilistic analysis to capture uncertainties. The optimization involves determination of demand allocations in the network, transportation modes between facilities, and production scheduling in manufacturing plants. A hypothetical three-echelon distribution network is studied, and the computation results demonstrated {{the reliability of the}} proposed algorithms. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
