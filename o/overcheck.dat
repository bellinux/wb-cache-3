50|$|Some horses pulling lighter vehicles, {{particularly}} at horse shows {{and other public}} exhibitions, may have an <b>overcheck</b> {{to assist them in}} holding a desired head position, and for safety reasons (to avoid the horse's head and neck going under the shaft in a stumble). In some cases a specially designed running martingale may also be added. A looser <b>overcheck</b> may also be used in a working harness to prevent the horse grazing. The <b>overcheck</b> hooks to a pedestal on the harness saddle.|$|E

50|$|The noseband is fitted {{into the}} bridle so {{has a certain}} amount of action, and is not on a {{separate}} headstall (also called sliphead) as is a cavesson. Harness bridles may feature a fancy browband, rosettes, and other ornamentation. An <b>overcheck</b> or sidecheck are sometimes used to control a horse’s head carriage and may be used in conjunction with an <b>overcheck</b> bit.|$|E
50|$|An <b>overcheck</b> has a {{practical}} purpose; if a horse lowers its head too far when in harness, particularly if moving quickly, it can catch the bridle on the shafts {{of the carriage}} or wagon, risking an accident. Properly adjusted and when used for a limited period of time, an <b>overcheck</b> does not significantly impede {{the motion of the}} horse or cause discomfort. If too tight, however, an <b>overcheck</b> rein can be uncomfortable because it puts strain on the neck muscles and ligaments. On a hard-working draft horse, it generally is not used at all, as it puts the animal off balance by preventing it from lowering its head when trying to pull significant weight. A horse pulling weight normally lowers and extends its neck in order to distribute the load. If an <b>overcheck</b> is inappropriately used, or used for too long a period, spinal strain resulting in neck or back injury can occur.|$|E

50|$|The modern <b>overcheck</b> {{is often}} a {{necessary}} piece of safety equipment for certain types of harness and is an aid to the driver in keeping a horse's head properly positioned.|$|E
50|$|Equipment with {{a similar}} purpose of {{stabilizing}} a bit or noseband include the forelock hanger (North America), bit lifter (Australia), and cheekers (Australia). The frentera {{is not to be}} confused {{with a similar}} appearing piece of tack, the <b>overcheck.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>overcheck</b> is {{also used}} today in some equestrian riding activities, and for certain types of horse training. In particular, it is used on certain saddle seat horses while on the longe line {{as part of a}} bitting rig that assists the horse in {{learning}} the proper high set head position for competition that also emphasizes high knee action. While not normally used by a rider in the saddle, it is common in some places to put an <b>overcheck</b> on ponies when being ridden by very young riders in order to prevent the pony from putting its head down and grazing while being ridden, an act of disobedience that a small child often lacks the physical strength to prevent.|$|E
50|$|An <b>overcheck</b> or {{bearing rein}} shares some {{function}} with side reins, draw reins, and the de Gogue, {{and has the}} opposite function to a chambon and martingale. It can {{be attached to the}} same bit as the reins, or to a second, separate bit.|$|E
50|$|A {{surcingle}} or roller is {{a padded}} band that straps around the horse's girth area, and has rings around {{on its side}} for side reins, or long reins or other training equipment, such as an <b>overcheck.</b> It may also be used on a young horse to get it used to girth pressure. It may be used with or without an English saddle underneath.|$|E
50|$|Variations of the pelham bit {{are often}} seen in driving in {{situations}} where a bit more control is required that can be obtained with a snaffle alone or {{with a combination of}} snaffle and <b>overcheck.</b> Shank designs and size are governed by the rules for various forms of competition and very considerably across disciplines from combined driving to draft horse showing.|$|E
5000|$|The use {{of only a}} {{surcingle}} {{and side}} reins, a common component in basic horse training across all equestrian disciplines, is not usually considered a [...] "bitting rig." [...] It {{is the use of}} additional reins such as the <b>overcheck,</b> or the use of leverage to place the horse's head in a set position that turns a classic surcingle into a bitting rig.|$|E
50|$|A bearing rein, {{known today}} as an <b>overcheck</b> or a checkrein, {{is a piece of}} horse tack that runs from a point on the horse's back, over the head, to a bit. It is used to prevent the horse from {{lowering}} its head beyond a fixed point. A variation called a side check passes beside the ears through loops {{at the top of the}} bridle cheekpieces.|$|E
50|$|The <b>overcheck</b> is {{generally}} not used to train dressage horses, because {{it can lead to}} the horse traveling with a hollow frame, the opposite of the rounded frame encouraged in dressage. A device that looks similar, the chambon, is sometimes used in training of dressage horses. However, the chambon encourages the horse to lower, not raise, its head. The Gogue is a related training tool.|$|E
5000|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, the <b>overcheck,</b> {{then called}} a [...] "bearing rein," [...] was {{commonly}} used on stylish carriage horses {{to keep their}} heads up, at times to an extreme degree, depending on the fashion of various periods. Today it is used primarily for horse show or exhibition use, particularly in the schooling and showing of fine harness horses and certain types of carriage horses.|$|E
50|$|Related {{types of}} checkrein {{often used in}} {{conjunction}} with an <b>overcheck</b> are side reins, a pair of reins which run simply from the bit to a surcingle or saddle, intended to keep the horse's head tucked in. Side reins are a very common training tool for working horses on the longe, also considered standard safety equipment in the sport of equestrian vaulting, but rarely if ever are used by a mounted rider.|$|E
5000|$|The racing harness, {{like the}} show harness, is a breastcollar harness. Horses are hitched {{to a very}} {{lightweight}} two-wheeled cart, called a sulky. Most race harnesses incorporate a running martingale and an <b>overcheck.</b> Sometimes harness racing horses are raced with an [...] "open" [...] bridle, {{one that does not}} have blinkers. Specialized equipment, called pacing hobbles, are added to the harness of race horses who pace in order to help them maintain their gait.|$|E
5000|$|In 1937, {{he scored}} his first success with a Linton tweed suit in sage green with a cerise <b>overcheck</b> called [...] "Panic".

By the late 1930s, Hardy was {{designing}} the entire Lachasse collection - succeeding Digby Morton.

He left Lachasse in 1939 and joined the House of Worth in 1941.|$|E
50|$|Many {{trainers}} first teach a {{young horse}} to accept girth pressure by strapping on a surcingle before a saddle and girth. The surcingle {{is commonly used}} for longeing, often as a base from which to attach training equipment such as side reins, <b>overcheck,</b> lauffer reins (sliding side reins), or chambons. A surcingle is also important in long lining or ground driving, as it provides rings for the long reins to run through. Double longeing, using two longe lines, {{requires the use of}} a surcingle to thread the longe lines through the rings.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Overcheck,</b> {{also called}} a bearing rein or [...] "check rein," [...] is a {{specialty}} rein {{that runs from}} a snaffle bit, past the crownpiece, along {{the crest of the}} neck, and attaches to the front of a harness on a driving horse. It prevents the horse from dropping its head too low. Overchecks are also sometimes used on riding horses, especially ponies, to keep them from grazing while being ridden by a small child who may lack the physical strength or skill to raise the animal's head up.|$|E
50|$|A chambon {{prevents}} the horse from raising its head beyond a fixed point. Raising the head causes {{the length of}} the chambon along the cheekpieces to shorten and thus puts reciprocal pressure on the horse's mouth and on the horse's poll. Horses generally dislike pressure behind the poll and learn to release the pressure by lowering their head, and when in motion, this encourages the horse to relax its back and bring its hindquarters further under its body, thus encouraging collection.The chambon has the opposite function to an <b>overcheck</b> or bearing rein, which is used to raise the horse's head.|$|E
5000|$|A basic bitting rig {{consists}} of a surcingle (also known as a roller) that {{has a number of}} rings on either side, placed at varying heights, usually with a crupper to prevent the surcingle from sliding forward. A bridle is also part of a bitting rig, with side reins and rings or small pulleys {{on either side of the}} browband to accommodate an <b>overcheck.</b> Some variations use pulleys and leverage on side reins to create a given [...] "headset." [...] Other designs add straps resembling breeching on the hindquarters to encourage engagement of the horse's rear end.|$|E
5000|$|The {{idea for}} the Polaris Military Tartan came from Captain Walter F Schlech while he was Commodore of SUBRON 14 in the early 1960s. The design of the tartan was done by Alexander MacIntyre of Strone. The tartan {{is the same as}} the Black Watch tartan with the {{addition}} of a yellow - black - sky blue - black - yellow <b>overcheck</b> of four threads each. The yellow and sky blue lines are said to represent the alternating blue and gold crews of the FBM submarines. [...] The tartan is worn by the members of the U.S. Naval Academy Pipes and Drums.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are other}} {{training}} devices that fall loosely in the martingale category, in that they use straps attached to the reins or bit which limit {{the movement of the}} horse's head or add leverage to the rider's hands in order to control the horse's head. Common devices of this nature include the <b>overcheck,</b> the chambon, de Gogue, grazing reins, draw reins and the [...] "bitting harness" [...] or [...] "bitting rig". However, most of this equipment is used for training purposes and is not legal in any competition. In some disciplines, use of leverage devices, even in training, is controversial.|$|E
50|$|It was Amies' mother’s {{contacts}} in the fashion world, and his flair for writing, that secured him his first job in fashion. It was his vivid description of a dress, written {{in a letter to}} a retired French seamstress, which brought Hardy {{to the attention of the}} owner of the Mayfair couture house Lachasse on Farm Street, Berkeley Square, as the wearer of the dress was the owner's wife. He became managing director at the age of 25, in 1934. In 1937, he scored his first success with a Linton tweed suit in sage green with a cerise <b>overcheck</b> called ‘Panic’. ‘Panic’ was to be his debut into the fashion bible Vogue and was photographed by Cecil Beaton. By the late 1930s, Hardy was designing the entire Lachasse collection. His second celebration creation was ‘Made in England’, a biscuit-coloured checked suit for the Hollywood ingénue Mildred Shay. He left Lachasse in 1939 and joined the House of Worth in 1941.|$|E
50|$|While a {{surcingle}} {{and side}} reins are considered classical training tools, {{the use of}} the full bitting rig is controversial in some circles. The basic debate is whether {{the use of the}} <b>overcheck</b> or any other rein setup other than the classic side rein is unnatural and develops incorrect musculature in the neck, back, and hindquarters. Like any tool, a bitting rig can be overused, leading to soreness and fatigue in the horse, and in some cases, improper use may teach a horse to lean on the bit and develop a hard mouth rather than relaxing and giving to it. Misuse can also lead to a horse that holds its head in a set position, but fails to properly engage the hindquarters and learn proper collection. Proponents argue that it safely teaches a horse a correct head position and gently accustoms a horse to what will be expected of it when carrying a rider.|$|E
5000|$|If a horse bucks, {{the best}} {{solution}} is to use one direct rein to pull the horse's head sideways and up, turning the horse in a small circle. If a rider pulls the horse's head up with both reins, the horse's neck is stronger and the rider {{is likely to be}} flipped over the horse's head. By turning the horse sideways, the rider has more leverage and a horse cannot easily buck while turning around. When the horse stops bucking, it must be asked to move forward; a horse also cannot buck very hard while moving forward. Usually a horse gives some warning that it is about to buck by dropping its head, slowing down or stopping, and excessively rounding up in the back (cowboys referred to this as [...] "getting a lump in the back"). To discourage bucking when the rider anticipates it, the rider should ask the horse to move forward or in a circle, raise their hands and the horse's head, and deliberately put the horse into a hollowed-out frame for a moment by sitting back a bit with their heels down, seat deep, and shoulders slightly back. This will help a rider stay in balance if the horse bucks, and the act of deliberately raising the head and hollowing out the horse's back reduces the power and severity of the buck. Certain training aids, such as a gag bit, certain types of martingale or, particularly on ponies, an <b>overcheck,</b> may also discourage bucking.|$|E
