25|$|Nobiin has two demonstrative pronouns: ìn 'this', {{denoting}} things nearby, and mán 'that', denoting things farther away. Both {{can function}} as the subject or the object in a sentence; {{in the latter case}} they take the <b>object</b> <b>marker</b> -gá yielding ìngà and mángá, respectively (for the <b>object</b> <b>marker,</b> see also below).

25|$|The basic {{word order}} in a Nobiin {{sentence}} is subject–object–verb. Objects {{are marked by}} an object suffix -gá, often assimilating to the final consonant of the word (e.g. kìtááb 'book', kìtááppá 'book-OBJECT' as seen below). In a sentence containing both an indirect and a direct object, the <b>object</b> <b>marker</b> is suffixed to both.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the encoding of animate/inanimate distinctions in the pronominal systems {{of a variety of}} Bantu languages. Various encoding strategies are found to suggest that there is a strong syntactic opposition between animate and inanimate <b>object</b> <b>markers</b> in Bantu languages. Restricted positions and obligatory presence are particularly important for <b>object</b> <b>markers</b> with animate referents. The nature of these strategies suggests a possible historical account of the origin of <b>object</b> <b>markers</b> in Bantu languages: <b>object</b> <b>markers</b> arose {{as a result of the}} pressure to mark, formally, object noun phrases with animate referents.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a {{detailed discussion of}} morphosyntactic variation in object marking in Bantu. Building on previous work (Marten et al., 2007), the paper investigates variation in object marking in 16 Bantu languages with respect to six parameters: the co-occurrence of <b>object</b> <b>markers</b> and lexical <b>objects,</b> the obligatoriness of <b>object</b> <b>markers</b> with specific classes of objects, the presence of locative <b>object</b> <b>markers,</b> multiple <b>object</b> <b>markers,</b> <b>object</b> marking in double object constructions, and object marking in relative clauses. The study shows that even within these fine-grained parameters, variation between different languages can be further distinguished. The paper provides a systematic overview {{of the kind of}} morphosyntactic variation found in Bantu, and provides an empirical framework for further descriptive and comparative studies. © 2012 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Mid-American Transportation Center. Bridges are a {{necessary}} part of any roadway system. Their construction requires a more sophisticated engineering design analysis and a higher construction cost than that for the roadways connecting them. Until relatively recently, bridge width on low volume roads was not a major concern and would often be reduced for economic reasons. Bridges and culverts that are narrower than the approach roadway cause considerable problems for a driver because they violate his/her expectations. In such cases, the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) states that Type 3 <b>object</b> <b>markers</b> shall be used on each approach. However, if narrow bridges are used by low, wide farm equipment (a harvester with 24 ft to 30 ft cutter bar), the <b>object</b> <b>markers</b> are frequently knocked-down. There is a need for signing and marking practices that allow rural, low volume bridges and culverts to be marked in accordance with the MUTCD and still allow farm equipment to pass over the bridge without destroying or damaging the <b>object</b> <b>markers.</b> Kansas State University conducted...|$|R

40|$|Conference PaperWe {{propose a}} method for the {{creation}} of <b>object</b> <b>markers</b> used in watershed segmentation of rock images. First, we use adaptive thresholding to segment the rock image since rock particles local background is often different from surrounding particle regions. <b>Object</b> <b>markers</b> are then extracted using the compactness of objects and adaptive morphological reconstruction. The choice of the feature compactness is motivated by the fact that crushed rocks tend to have rounded shapes. Experimental results after comparing the segmented images show that the performance of our algorithm is superior to most standard methods of watershed segmentation. We also show that the proposed algorithm was more robust in the estimation of fines in rock samples than the traditional methods. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
