As an {{important}} part of the CTCS- 3 train control system, the <b>on-board</b> <b>subsystem</b> is a safety critical system, and it plays {{an important}} role in assuring the safety of train. In this essay, we choose a hybrid testing method combined with the advantage of black- box and white-box testing method in the test of the Simulation of <b>on-board</b> <b>subsystem</b> of the CTCS- 3 train control system. The main idea is to divide the tested system into several functional parts, and then test them step by step. At last, we use an example to show the advantage of this testing method in reducing the number of test cases. 1 Current situation in the testing of train control system at home and abroad Train control system plays an important role in ensuring the operational safety of the train, At home and abroad researchers attach great importance to the testing of the train control system, and also a lot of research has been done. The simulation test makes it easier for the testers to work in the lab instead of the field, so that it reduce the human and material costs, and the test environment can be controlled and repeatable easily. Besides, the special environment of the site can also be simulated.

40|$|In modern railway Automatic Train Protection and Automatic Train Control systems, odometry is {{a safety}} {{relevant}} <b>on-board</b> <b>subsystem</b> which estimates the instantaneous speed and the travelled {{distance of the}} train; a high reliability of the odometry estimate is fundamental, since an error on the train position {{may lead to a}} potentially dangerous overestimation of the distance available for braking. To improve the odometry estimate accuracy, data fusion of different inputs coming from a redundant sensor layout may be used. Simplified two-dimensional models of railway vehicles have been usually used for Hardware in the Loop test rig testing of conventional odometry algorithms and of on-board safety relevant subsystems (like the Wheel Slide Protection braking system) in which the train speed is estimated from the measures of the wheel angular speed. Two-dimensional models are not suitable to develop solutions like the inertial type localisation algorithms (using 3 D accelerometers and 3 D gyroscopes) and the introduction of Global Positioning System (or similar) or the magnetometer. In order to test these algorithms correctly and increase odometry performances, a three-dimensional multibody model of a railway vehicle has been developed, using Matlab-Simulink™, including an efficient contact model which can simulate degraded adhesion conditions (the development and prototyping of odometry algorithms involve the simulation of realistic environmental conditions). In this paper, the authors show how a 3 D railway vehicle model, able to simulate the complex interactions arising between different on-board subsystems, can be useful to evaluate the odometry algorithm and safety relevant to <b>on-board</b> <b>subsystem</b> performances...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of passenger cars worldwide and the consequent increasing rate of global oil consump- tion have raised the pressure on fuel prices and have caused serious problems to the environment. Nowadays, the demand for reducing fuel consumption and pollutant emissions has {{paved the way for}} the development of more efficient power generation systems for the transportation sector. In the past decades, environmental advantages of the gas turbine, such as low concentration of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions, have led some car manufacturers to evaluate the potential of this type of engine as prime mover. The viability of an engine for road vehicle applications is highly dependent on its performance, mainly in terms of fuel consumption. This assessment is rather complex and involves high costs. Nevertheless, these costs can be mitigated by utilizing simulation tools that predict the performance of the vehicle and its <b>on-board</b> <b>subsystems</b> under a variety of driving conditions. This work focuses on the development of a methodology and tools for simulating the performance of gas turbines powering road vehicles, in a wide range of simulation conditions. Three different codes were used in order to carry out this study: focusing on simulating the thermodynamic cycle of three different gas turbine models; post-processing the gas turbine performance data generated; and simulating the performance of two different road vehicles at various driving conditions. Simulations were carried out using a quasistatic approach; the results generated were quite distinct for the different vehicles, driving patterns and engine configurations tested. The simulations indicate that vehicles powered by gas turbines have higher fuel consumption than the ones equipped with reciprocating engines, independently of the driving conditions simulated. Nevertheless, more innovative cycles incorporating advanced technologies could in the future change this picture. The developed platform permits not only the simulation of innovative and complex gas turbine configurations (with higher efficiency compared to the concepts already assessed) operating as prime movers in road vehicles, but also the modeling of hybrid powertrains, combining electric propulsion with this type of engine. Some car manufacturers argue that the use of a gas turbine operating as range extender in a series hybrid configuration is the most efficiency solution in the coming years. The methodology presented in this work sets the formulation for performing such an assessment and provides a first estimate for the fuel economy of different powertrain topologies...|$|R

The sensory layer in the smart logistics system is mainly composed of the data acquisition layer and the access layer. The data acquisition layer mainly uses the sensors, bar codes, and RFID tags in the Internet of Things technology to capture the information of items under the line to the mobile device or the personal computer (PC) through sensor technology, barcode recognition technology, and radio-frequency identification technology. Then, through the network upload function in the access layer, the network, such as a mobile network, a wireless network, or a wired network, is transmitted to the global IoT network. The design of the network layer is more professional, and most of them involve computer professional knowledge. This article is biased toward theorization, so it can only find relevant supporting materials from the literature and supplement of it with understanding. The network layer in the smart logistics system based on the Internet of Things technology is a bridge connecting customers and background data. Its main function is achieved through the network transmission platform and application platform, and the two platforms can be uniformly understood as an information integration platform. The network layer is the link that connects the major components of the logistics information system and is the basis for realizing information sharing and real-time communication. The basic communication network of logistics information system can be divided into three major components: logistics park network, urban logistics information network, and wireless communication network. The logistics park network serves the logistics management department of the park and the logistics enterprises of the park, connecting their respective management information systems and accessing the urban logistics information network to provide timely, smooth, and effective logistics information services for enterprises in the park. Urban logistics information network refers to the urban backbone network that connects the logistics park, logistics public information platform, logistics trading platform, industry management subsystem, and enterprise logistics information system, and realizes the organic integration of information resources of major subsystems.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The modern military aircraft {{can be defined as}} a System of Systems (SoS); several distinct systems operating simultaneously across boundary interfaces. As the <b>on-board</b> <b>subsystems</b> have become more complex and diverse, the development process has become more isolated. When considering thermal management of distributed heat loads, the aircraft has become a collection of individually optimised components and subsystems, rather than the implementation of a single system to perform a given task. Avionic thermal management is quickly becoming a limiting factor of aircraft performance, reliability and effectiveness. The challenge of avionic thermal management is growing with the increasing complexity and power density of avionic packages. The aircraft relies on a heat rejection growth capacity to accommodate the additional through-life avionic heat loads. Growth capacity is defined as an allowable thermal loading growth designed into the system by the underutilisation of spatial and cooling supply at aircraft introduction; however, this is a limited resource and aircraft subsystem cooling capability is reaching a critical point. The depleted growth capacity coupled with increased avionic power demands has led to component thermal failure. However, due to the poor resolution of existing data acquisition, experimental facilities or thermodynamic modeling, the exact inflight-operating conditions remain relatively unknown. The knowledge gap identified in this work is the lack of definitive methodology to generate high fidelity data of in-flight thermal conditions of fast-jet subsystems and provide evidence towards effective future thermal management technologies. It is shown that, through {{the development of a new}} methodology, the knowledge gap can be reduced and as an output of this approach the unknown system behaviour can be defined. A multidisciplinary approach to the replication, analysis and optimisation of a fast-jet TMS is detailed. The development of a new Ground Test Facility (GTF) allows previously unidentified system thermal behaviour to be evaluated at component, subsystem and system level. The development of new data to characterise current thermal performance of a fast jet TMS allows recommendations of several new technologies to be implemented through a component led integrative system optimisation. This approach is to consider the TMS as a single system to achieve a single goal of component thermal management. Three technologies are implemented to optimise avionic conditions through the minimisation of bleed air consumption, improve avionic reliability through increased avionic component isothermalisation and increase growth capacity through improved avionic heat exchanger fin utilisation. These component level technologies improved system level performance. A reduction in TMS bleed air consumption from 1225 kg to 510 kg was found to complete a typical flight profile. A peak predicted aircraft specific fuel consumption saving of 1. 23...|$|R

There are numerous information systems currently being fielded or developed (e. g., routing and navigation, collision avoidance).

The exploitation of these missions will require extensive navigation and guidance, and limited and expensive ground-based assets could be advantageously integrated or substituted by autonomous capabilities. The paper investigates two possible approaches to provide these capabilities {{by means of a}} navigation infrastructure. The first approach deals with exploiting at their limit the possibilities of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) that, while primarily directed to serve the Earth and the low altitude orbits, are also able to extend their serviced volume at higher altitudes. By means of advanced use of the GNSS signals and a special architecture of the <b>on-board</b> navigation <b>subsystem</b> {{it would be possible to}} guide autonomously a complete mission to the Moon.

This system should be far simpler than current GNSS, providing the service to the areas of interest without a continuity requirement.

Among the studied technologies, Counter Rotating Open Rotor (CROR) propeller technologies are appearing as a promising, though highly challenging, alternative solution to Ultra High Bypass Ratio (UHBR) engines. Amongst these challenges, {{the interaction of the}} wake of the CROR engine pylon with the counter rotating blades, positioned downstream of the pylon (pusher configuration), are responsible for both airframe noise and vibrations that penalize aircraft certification. ‘Erasing’ the pylon wake such as to recover a strictly uniform flow upstream of the rotating blades would suppress this major source of airframe noise and vibrations.

These factors {{are related to the}} design of interoperable railway networks in Europe, the introduction of new technologies and equipment, and the competition in the market of railway products. The safety of such new design and implementation solutions should still be proved in accordance with the CENELEC recommendations. In this paper SFDA, Safe message Freshness Detection Algorithm among trackside subsystems, is deeply described. SFDA is included in a new message passing safety protocol stack and it allows the detection of "old" messages and the meeting of real time and safety requirements of trackside railway systems. It is demonstrated that the SFDA can detect all the old messages. Moreover a preliminary analysis of its availability characteristics to check whether it is suitable for railways systems is performed through simulation.

40|$|Today’s Aerospace {{vehicles}} utilise numerous pyrotechnic {{devices to}} separate structural subsystems, deploy appendages and activate <b>on-board</b> operational <b>subsystems.</b> The firing of these pyrotechnical charges generates severe impulsive loads (so-called pyroshocks) {{that can cause}} failures in electronic components. There {{is a lack of}} computational techniques to predict the dynamic behaviour of complex structures when subjected to high frequency shock waves as well as a lack of damage and failure criteria for electronic equipment and so the projects must rely on testing to validate the design. Alcatel ETCA has developed a pyroshock test facility dedicated to the testing of electronic units. The facility utilises a resonant test fixture assembly that is excited by a detonating charge or a mechanical impact. The test fixture assembly can be a simple plate, a beam, a double plate assembly or a more complex structure. The test item attached to the fixture is subjected to the direct shock wave and to the resonant response of the test fixture, which simulates the desired pyroshock. The test set up is checked and tuned versus the test specification by using a dummy of the test item. When the desired pyroshock is achieved, the nominal tests are performed on the test item. Part I of this presentation describes the main characteristics of the test facility: test fixtures, excitation techniques, data acquisition, and data processing. Part II presents some test results and details the effects of variables upon the induced shock response spectra. The main variables are related to the design of the test fixture (type, size, material) and the characteristics of the excitation (amount of explosive, location of explosive, and so on) ...|$|R
40|$|With {{the advance}} on {{technology}} field, aerospace {{systems have been}} evolving during the years. Tendency on reducing size, mass and cost by increasing the efficiency on different elements has opened {{a wide range of}} possibilities. In this project is presented the design of the bus for a very small solar sail including the electric power <b>subsystem,</b> communication <b>subsystems,</b> <b>on-board</b> computer as well as the description of the mission. Few years ago, the elaboration of any spacecraft involved high economical costs leaving this possibility only to big companies, with the appearance from nanosatellites to fentosatellites, this possibility has been open to small companies or university research groups, allowing at the same time, scientific advance on space exploration. In this project is presented the design of the bus for a very small solar sail, which includes the electrical power subsystem, communication <b>subsystem</b> and the <b>on-board</b> computer. The main difficulty on this project resides on the mass requirements, limiting with a maximum weight of 50 grams for all those subsystems listed before...|$|R
