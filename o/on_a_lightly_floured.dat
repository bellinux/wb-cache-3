50|$|Many newer medium calibre APDS cores use a {{frangible}} {{high density}} alloy, the resulting projectiles are called Frangible Armour Piercing Discarding Sabot (FAPDS) for APDS types, or FRAP (Frangible Armour Piercing) for full-calibre projectiles. During penetration, a frangible projectile's core fragments into many high-velocity pieces. The effect of <b>a</b> frangible projectile <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> armoured target {{is much the}} same as a high explosive incendiary round, but with a cloud of dense, high-velocity fragments penetrating deeper into the target's interior. Upon striking heavy armour the effect of FAPDS is more akin to a standard APDS, albeit with higher fragmentation of the core, and hence lethality if the armour is perforated.|$|R
50|$|Since chain wear is {{strongly}} aggravated by dirt {{getting into the}} links, the lifetime of a chain depends mostly on how well it is cleaned (and lubricated) and {{does not depend on}} the mechanical load. Therefore, well-groomed chains of heavily used racing bicycles will often last longer than <b>a</b> chain <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> used city bike that's cleaned less. Depending on use and cleaning, a chain can last only 1000 km (e.g. in cross-country use, or all-weather use), 3000 to 5000 km for well-maintained derailleur chains, or more than 6000 km for perfectly groomed high-quality chains, single-gear, or hub-gear chains (preferably with a full cover chain guard).|$|R
40|$|Eleven {{bacterial}} and two yeast strains, four {{of which}} were previously identified as having activity <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> cross-linked carboxymethyl cellulose (CLD- 2) found in one type of superabsorbent tampon, were grown <b>on</b> <b>a</b> variety of substrates, most containing cellulosics. None produced detectable amounts of cellulases, but all elaborated beta-glucosidase. None of these 13 strains nor 3 commercially obtained beta-glucosidase preparations could hydrolyze CLD- 2, although a commercial cellulase and two other bacterial preparations known to produce cellulases could. Based on these results, it appears that previous work suggesting that the degradation of CLD- 2 by vaginal microbes and beta-glucosidase is implicated in the production by Staphylococcus aureus of toxin causing toxic shock syndrome must be reevaluated...|$|R

50|$|Some claim thatch cannot {{cope with}} regular {{snowfall}} but, {{as with all}} roofing materials, this depends {{on the strength of}} the underlying roof structure and the pitch of the surface. A law passed in 1640 in Massachusetts outlawed the use of thatched roofs in the colony for this reason. Thatch is lighter than most other roofing materials, typically around 7 lb per square foot, so the roof supporting it {{does not need to be}} so heavily constructed, but if snow accumulates <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> constructed thatched roof, it could collapse. A thatched roof is usually pitched between 45-55 degrees and under normal circumstances this is sufficient to shed snow and water. In areas of extreme snowfall, such as parts of Japan, the pitch is increased further.|$|R

40|$|Addressing {{the problem}} of timely packet {{transmission}} in a wireless soft real-time system such as one would find on the battlefield, we present five splitting protocols that take packet deadlines into account. Three are blocked access and two are free access algorithms. Mathematical models of the algorithms are developed, and compared with simulations. We show, as expected, that the blocked access algorithms usually offer higher success rates than the free access versions. Of the two best performing blocked access protocols, performance differences are slight <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> loaded channel.

Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) capacitors have been fabricated with an optimum annealing temperature of 800 degrees C for one hour in a preheated furnace. The dielectric degradation is annealing temperature dependent. A degradation of 1. 4 %, 1. 2 % and 1. 1 % has been observed for 400 degrees C, 600 degrees C and 1000 degrees C temperature annealed MOS respectively.

30|$|One of the {{key issues}} in the solar {{industry}} is lowering dopant concentration of emitter for high-efficiency crystalline solar cells. However, {{it is well known}} that a low surface concentration of dopants results in poor contact formation between the front Ag electrode and the n-layer of Si. In this paper, an evaporated Mg layer is used to reduce series resistance of c-Si solar cells. A layer of Mg metal is deposited <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> doped n-type Si emitter by evaporation. Ag electrode is screen printed to collect the generated electrons. Small work function difference between Mg and n-type silicon reduces the contact resistance. During a co-firing process, Mg is oxidized, and the oxidized layer serves as an antireflection layer. The measurement of an Ag/Mg/n-Si solar cell shows that Voc, Jsc, FF, and efficiency are 602 mV, 36.9 mA/cm 2, 80.1 %, and 17.75 %, respectively. It can be applied to the manufacturing of low-cost, simple, and high-efficiency solar cells.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{nanosized}} capsules based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> cross-linked polyamide containing azobenzene moieties in {{the main}} chain were synthesized by miniemulsion interfacial polymerization. The obtained nanocapsules were loaded either with toluene or with the fluorescent probe coumarin- 6 as a core. Diameters of the nanocapsules were in the 100 - 900 nm range, depending on the selected emulsion conditions. The morphology {{and shape of the}} samples were observed by TEM and SEM while the emulsion droplets and nanocapsules size was measured by DLS. Under continuous UV irradiation the polymer underwent E-Z photoisomerization allowing the release of the encapsulated material. Variation in diameter of the nanocapsules with the time of UV irradiation was detected through DLS analysis. 10 - 30 % growth was observed, depending on the sample. The kinetics of release of coumarin- 6 was followed by spectrofluorimetry in ethanol. In absence of irradiation, the fluorescence intensity appeared to be constant over time, while it increased when the sample was irradiated with 360 nm UV light...|$|R
40|$|The lateral drift {{capacity}} of vertical reinforced concrete elements (e. g. columns and walls) cannot be precisely modelled without considering the four predominant deformation mechanisms: strain penetration, flexure, shear, and sliding shear.

This paper summarises results {{from a series of}} miniature experimentations that was undertaken to study the localization of strains surrounding <b>a</b> preformed crack <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> reinforced concrete element. The development of strains on the reinforcement in the plastic hinge range region up to the limit of rupture was of particular interests.

40|$|Software {{distributed}} {{shared memory}} (DSM) platforms on networks of workstations tolerate large network latencies by employing {{one of several}} weak memory consistency models. Data-race tolerant applications, such as Genetic Algorithms (GAS), Probabilistic Inference, etc., offer an additional degree of freedom to tolerate network latency: they do not synchronize shared memory references, and behave correctly when supplied outdated shared data. However; these algorithms often have a high communication-to-computation ratio and can jlood the network with messages {{in the presence of}} large message delays. We study the performance of controlled asynchronous implementations of these algorithms via the use of our previously proposed blocking GlobalRead memory access primitive. GlobalRead implements non-strict cache coherence by guaranteeing to return to the reader a shared datum value from within a specified staleness range. Experiments <b>on</b> <b>an</b> IBM SP 2 multicomputer with an Ethernet show significant performance improvements for controlled asynchronous implementations. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> loaded Ethernet network, most of the GA benchmarks see 30 % to 40 % improvement over the best competitor for 2 to 16 processors, while two of the Probabilistic Inference benchmarks see more than 80 % improvement for 2 processors.

40|$|The type of {{excitation}} and {{averaging technique}} used during data acquisition can greatly influence {{the quality of}} the resulting MIMI-FRF measurements. The choice of excitation/average technique used is dependent on the properties of the structure being tested. This paper will present two case studies, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> damped and heavily damped circular plate, to illustrate that while one technique provides good results on one structure {{it may not be the}} best tech-nique to use <b>on</b> <b>a</b> different structure. This paper will also demon-strate that given the same total test time the resulting MIMO-FRF’s can range from poor to excellent in quality. This improvement in quality is directly reflected by the multiple coherence plot which goes form low coherence values at resonances, which shows that leakage exists, to nearly perfect coherence, which shows that leak-age was eliminated, for the poor to excellent cases, respectively. As a more realistic situation the same excitation/averaging tech-niques used above will also be performed <b>on</b> <b>an</b> untrimmed and fully trimmed automotive system.
