5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} and seventeenth centuries, {{the status of}} women amongst masons in Britain is likely to be similar to that codified in the minutes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lodge</b> at St. Mary's Chapel in Edinburgh. A burgess could pay for the Freedom to employ and {{instruct}} masons. The widow of a master mason could accept commissions from his old clients, provided that she employed a journeyman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lodge</b> to supervise the work.|$|E
5|$|During the {{ceremony}} of initiation, the candidate {{is expected to}} swear (usually on a volume of sacred text appropriate to his personal religious faith) to fulfil certain obligations as a Mason. In the course of three degrees, new masons will promise to keep the secrets of their degree from lower degrees and outsiders, and to support a fellow Mason in distress (as far as practicality and the law permit). There is instruction as to the duties of a Freemason, but on the whole, Freemasons are left to explore the craft in the manner they find most satisfying. Some will further explore the ritual and symbolism of the craft, others will focus their involvement on the social side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lodge,</b> while still others will concentrate on the charitable functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lodge.</b>|$|E

50|$|Before <b>the</b> {{unification}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grand <b>Lodges</b> to form <b>the</b> United Grand <b>Lodge</b> <b>of</b> England in 1813, Phoenix Lodge was {{a member}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Premier Grand <b>Lodge</b> (<b>the</b> Moderns) which pre-dated <b>the</b> Antient Grand <b>Lodge</b> (<b>the</b> Antients) by 34 years. In keeping with these traditional roots, <b>the</b> <b>Lodge</b> works Old Working <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Craft ritual, {{as opposed to the}} more modern Emulation Working, which has become common in Craft <b>lodges</b> throughout <b>the</b> English-speaking world. A unique feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lodge's</b> ritual is that the ceremonial contains singing and music accompaniment throughout.|$|R
5|$|John W. Davis, US Representative and {{nominee for}} President against Calvin Coolidge, visited the lodge in 1924. US Senator Chauncey Depew visited in 1924 and 1927. Composer and pianist Percy Grainger gave a recital at the ballroom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lodge</b> in 1925.|$|E
5|$|Mountfort was a Freemason and {{an early}} member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lodge</b> of Unanimity, the main {{building}} of which he designed in 1863. The Lodge of Unanimity was the first Masonic Lodge in the South Island.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{petitioned the}} American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials {{in the mid-1980s}} to {{truncate}} US10 to Bay City. The request was approved on October 11, 1985, and the signage was changed the next year. After the change, the Lodge Freeway was redesignated M-10. The non-freeway Northwestern Highway, until then designated M-4, was also renumbered as M-10. The southernmost portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lodge</b> Freeway was also initially redesignated as a portion of BS I-375 from I-75 south. By the next year however, {{the southern end of}} M-10 was moved to the corner of Jefferson and Randolph, placing all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lodge</b> Freeway as part of M-10.|$|E

5|$|The OA Universal Ribbon is worn {{suspended}} from the right uniform shirt pocket button. Vigil Honor recipients may add the Vigil Honor pin to the ribbon. Lodge affiliation is indicated by the wearing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lodge</b> emblem (commonly known as a lodge flap), an embroidered patch is worn on the right pocket flap of the uniform shirt. Each lodge flap has a unique design, generally reflecting the name, geography or history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lodge.</b> Special issues of flaps may be created to commemorate anniversaries and other events and are a popular item for those who engage in Scouting memorabilia collecting.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Masonic ritual {{consists}} of degree ceremonies. Candidates for Freemasonry are progressively initiated into Freemasonry, {{first in the}} degree of Entered Apprentice. Some time later, in a separate ceremony, they will be passed to the degree of Fellowcraft, and finally they will be raised to the degree of Master Mason. In all of these ceremonies, the candidate is entrusted with passwords, signs and grips (secret handshakes) peculiar to his new rank. Another ceremony is the annual installation of the Master and officers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lodge.</b> In some jurisdictions Installed Master is valued as a separate rank, with its own secrets to distinguish its members. In other jurisdictions, the grade is not recognised, and no inner ceremony conveys new secrets during the installation of a new Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lodge.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{officers}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lodge</b> {{are elected}} or appointed annually. Every Masonic Lodge has a Master, two Wardens, a secretary and a treasurer.

5|$|After {{moving to}} London, his editorship of the Freemason ignited an {{interest}} in the study of Masonic history, and led to the establishment of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, dedicated to masonic research. Woodford was the first Immediate Past Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lodge,</b> and as such convened the lodge for much of its first two years, during the frequent absences of Charles Warren, the master. Just before his death, towards the end of 1887, he passed on a set of coded papers which resulted in the establishment of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.|$|E
5|$|At its 1902 opening, the Briarcliff Lodge was {{a premier}} resort hotel. The Tudor Revival-style {{building}} {{was surrounded by}} dairy barns and greenhouses (built by Law), and hosted numerous distinguished guests, including Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. The hotel declined during the 1930s but the lodge remained in use, housing the Edgewood Park School (1936–1954) and The King's College (1955–1994). The original 1902 Briarcliff Lodge building {{burned to the ground}} on September 20, 2003, and contemporary portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lodge</b> and other campus buildings were later demolished.|$|E

50|$|However, {{there are}} jurisdictions {{in which the}} office is {{distinct}} from any other, in which cases <b>the</b> duties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> office revolve around <b>the</b> organisation <b>of</b> processions and ensuring the correct precedence and etiquette in formal proceedings, including <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> visitors to <b>the</b> <b>lodge.</b> This is distinct (in such jurisdictions) from <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Director <b>of</b> Ceremonies in supervising <b>the</b> ritual <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lodge's</b> degree ceremonies.|$|R
50|$|After the Second World War, a {{shortage}} of cash and materials and {{a general lack of}} interest in Bath's architecture meant that <b>the</b> fabric <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge was neglected. By the 1980s, three out <b>of</b> four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lodges</b> were derelict and unfit for human habitation. Concerned at <b>the</b> neglect <b>of</b> this unique structure by its owners, Bath and North East Somerset Council, a group of local individuals formed a charity (the Bath Historical Buildings Trust) to take a very long lease on three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lodges</b> and to restore them so that they could once again become homes for people. This work is almost complete.|$|R
5|$|San Martín, Alvear and Zapiola {{established}} a local branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lodge</b> of Rational Knights, along with morenists, the former {{supporters of the}} late Mariano Moreno. This lodge sought to promote liberal ideas; its secrecy hides {{whether it was a}} real Masonic lodge, or a lodge with political goals. It had no ties to the Premier Grand Lodge of England. San Martín married María de los Remedios de Escalada, a 14-year-old girl from one of the local wealthy families.|$|E
5|$|The {{last few}} {{years of his life}} were also {{occupied}} in collaboration with other Masonic researchers, such as Hughan and Gould, which eventually brought into being England's first research lodge, Quatuor Coronati. As acting Immediate Past Master, he guided the lodge through its first two years of existence, taking the chair in the frequent absences of the Master, Charles Warren, then Metropolitan Commissioner of Police. It is plain from Gould's obituary that the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lodge</b> looked on him as a mentor.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} building burnt down in 1937 causing $200,000 {{worth of}} damage; the incident which {{was thought to}} have been arson but no charges were ever brought. The reconstruction effort took 30 days, with 500 men working on the project. State legislation was changed shortly afterwards to allow gambling, and following the purchase by developer Norman Blitz it became one of Nevada's earliest legalized casinos and rumors abounded that there was an intention by the owners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lodge</b> to put a gambling boat on the lake.|$|E

5|$|Three deputies from Coquimbo, Santiago and Concepción {{organized}} a new government, and proposed San Martín as Supreme Director of Chile. He declined the offer and proposed O'Higgins in his stead: he {{recommended that the}} Supreme Director should be someone from Chile. San Martín would instead organize the navy to take the fight to Peru. He established a local chapter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lodge</b> of Rational Knights, named as Logia Lautaro, in reference to mapuche leader Lautaro.|$|E
5|$|Candidates for Freemasonry {{will have}} met most active members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lodge</b> they are joining {{before they are}} initiated. The process varies between jurisdictions, but the {{candidate}} will typically have been introduced by a friend at a Lodge social function, or at some form of open evening in the Lodge. In modern times, interested people often track down a local Lodge through the Internet. The onus is on candidates to ask to join; while candidates may be encouraged to ask, they are never invited. Once the initial inquiry is made, an interview usually follows to determine the candidate's suitability. If the candidate decides to proceed from here, the Lodge ballots on the application before he (or she, depending on the Masonic Jurisdiction) can be accepted.|$|E
5|$|During the Sun Dance, {{which is}} practiced by many Plains Indian tribes, the eagle is {{represented}} in several ways. The eagle nest {{is represented by the}} fork <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lodge</b> where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used {{during the course of the}} dance. Also during the dance, a medicine man may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to be healed. The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.|$|E
