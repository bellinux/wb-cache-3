5|$|Phosphorylation: cTnI was {{the first}} sarcomeric protein {{identified}} to be a substrate of PKA. Phosphorylation of cTnI at Ser23/Ser24 under adrenergic stimulation enhances relaxation <b>of</b> <b>cardiac</b> muscle, which is critical to cardiac function especially at fast heart rate. Whereas PKA phosphorylation of Ser23/Ser24 decreases myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and increases relaxation, phosphorylation of Ser42/Ser44 by PKC increases Ca2+ sensitivity and decreases cardiac muscle relaxation. Ser5/Ser6, Tyr26, Thr31, Ser39, Thr51, Ser77, Thr78, Thr129, Thr143 and Ser150 are also phosphorylation sites in human cTnI.|$|E

5|$|Adult coconut crabs have {{no known}} predators {{apart from other}} coconut crabs and humans. Its large size {{and the quality of}} its meat means that the coconut crab is {{extensively}} hunted and is very rare on islands with a human population. The coconut crab is eaten by Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders and is considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac, and intensive hunting has threatened the species' survival in some areas. While the coconut crab itself is not innately poisonous, it may become so depending on its diet, and cases of coconut crab poisoning have occurred. For instance, consumption of the sea mango Cerbera manghas by the coconut crab may make the coconut crab toxic due to the presence <b>of</b> <b>cardiac</b> cardenolides.|$|E

He also advised foreign minister Adam Malik. After returning to Indonesia in 1971, Soedjatmoko held a position in several think tanks.

5|$|Heart {{failure is}} where the heart can't beat out enough blood {{to meet the needs}} of the body. It is {{generally}} a chronic condition, associated with age, that progresses gradually. Each side of the heart can fail independently of the other, resulting in heart failure of the right heart or the left heart. Left heart failure can also lead to right heart failure (cor pulmonale) by increasing strain on the right heart. If the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood, it may accumulate throughout the body, causing breathlessness in the lungs (pulmonary congestion; pulmonary edema), swelling (edema) of the feet or other gravity-dependent areas, decrease exercise tolerance, or cause other clinical signs such as an enlarged liver, cardiac murmurs, or a raised jugular venous pressure. Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, valve disorders and diseases <b>of</b> <b>cardiac</b> muscle.|$|E

He received the Asia Society Award in 1985, and the Universities Field Staff International Award for Distinguished Service to the Advancement of International Understanding the following year.

5|$|Studies to {{quantify}} this theory {{have shown that}} there is an overall decreased systemic vascular resistance in hepatorenal syndrome, but that the measured femoral and kidney fractions <b>of</b> <b>cardiac</b> output are respectively increased and reduced, suggesting that splanchnic vasodilation is implicated in the kidney failure. Many vasoactive chemicals have been hypothesized as being involved in mediating the systemic hemodynamic changes, including atrial natriuretic factor, prostacyclin, thromboxane A2, and endotoxin. In addition to this, it has been observed that the administration of medications to counteract splanchnic vasodilation (such as ornipressin, terlipressin, and octreotide) leads to improvement in glomerular filtration rate (which is a quantitative measure of kidney function) in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, providing further evidence that splanchnic vasodilation is a key feature of its pathogenesis.|$|E

5|$|The {{function}} of TnI is to control striated muscle contraction and relaxation. Troponin I interacts with all major regulatory proteins in the sarcomeric thin filaments <b>of</b> <b>cardiac</b> and skeletal muscles: troponin C, troponin T, tropomyosin and actin. When cytosolic Ca2+ is low, TnI binds the thin filament {{to block the}} myosin binding sites on actin. The rise of cytosolic Ca2+ results in binding to the N-terminal domain of troponin C and induces conformational changes in troponin C and the troponin complex, which releases the inhibition of myosin-actin interaction and activates myosin ATPase and cross bridge cycling to generate myosin power strokes and muscle contraction.|$|E
5|$|When {{used for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe drug. Common side effects of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%). Fungal infections such as thrush and vaginal candidiasis may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called antibiotic candidiasis). Less common (and potentially more serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, and elevated transaminases, which {{may be a sign}} of liver damage. Unlike some antibiotics, such as erythromycin and the quinolones, linezolid has no effect on the QT interval, a measure <b>of</b> <b>cardiac</b> electrical conduction.
