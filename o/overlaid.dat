5|$|The {{mortuary}} temple {{featured the}} first palmiform columns of any Egyptian temple, massive granite architraves inscribed with Sahure's titulary <b>overlaid</b> with copper, black basalt flooring and granite dados.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{all sides}} of a stela were sculpted with human figures and hieroglyphic text, with each side forming {{a part of a}} single composition. Undecorated stelae in the form of plain slabs or columns of stone are found {{throughout}} the Maya region. These appear never to have been painted or to have been decorated with <b>overlaid</b> stucco sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Open-weave {{glass fiber}} grids {{are used to}} {{reinforce}} asphalt pavement. Non-woven glass fiber/polymer blend mats are used saturated with asphalt emulsion and <b>overlaid</b> with asphalt, producing a waterproof, crack-resistant membrane. Use of glass-fiber reinforced polymer rebar instead of steel rebar shows promise in areas where avoidance of steel corrosion is desired.|$|E
5|$|Southern Bedfordshire {{is part of}} the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. North and mid Bedfordshire are undulating claylands {{with broad}} river valleys of the River Great Ouse and its tributaries, and the Bedfordshire Greensand Ridge. Jurassic and Cretaceous clays are <b>overlaid</b> by Quaternary glacial {{deposits}} of chalky boulder clay.|$|E
5|$|The rise {{of modern}} {{archeology}} has contributed {{much to the}} study of the Great Wall, either in corroborating existing research or in refuting it. However these efforts do not yet give a full picture of the Great Wall's history, as many wall sites dating to the Period of Disunity (220589) had been <b>overlaid</b> by the extant Ming Great Wall.|$|E
5|$|Grim Fandango is an {{adventure}} game developed {{and published by}} LucasArts in 1998 for Microsoft Windows, with Tim Schafer as the game's project leader. It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use 3D computer graphics <b>overlaid</b> on pre-rendered, static backgrounds. As with other LucasArts adventure games, the player must converse with other characters and examine, collect, and use objects correctly to solve puzzles in order to progress.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of stelae {{have been}} {{recorded}} in the Maya region, displaying a wide stylistic variation. Many are upright slabs of limestone sculpted on one or more faces, with available surfaces sculpted with figures carved in relief and with hieroglyphic text. Stelae in a few sites display a much more three-dimensional appearance where locally available stone permits, such as at Copán and Toniná. Plain stelae {{do not appear to}} have been painted nor <b>overlaid</b> with stucco decoration, but most Maya stelae were probably brightly painted in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours.|$|E
5|$|In early 2013, the Recess Gallery in New York City's SoHo {{neighbourhood}} presented We Buy White Albums, {{an installation}} by artist Rutherford Chang. The piece {{was in the}} form of a record store in which nothing but original pressings of the LP was on display. Chang created a recording in which the sounds of one hundred copies of side one of the LP were <b>overlaid.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of European American {{settlers}} and explorers, the Allegheny Plateau region of West Virginia, lying {{to the west of the}} Allegheny and Cumberland mountain ranges of the Appalachian Mountains, was <b>overlaid</b> with old-growth forests consisting predominantly of deciduous mixed oaks and chestnut trees. The cove forests of the Appalachian Mountains were undisturbed for approximately 300 million years, and the ample moisture and deep soils of cove topography allowed for the proliferation of temperate broadleaf and mixed forest species.|$|E
5|$|The US-412 {{designation}} {{was applied}} to preexisting Oklahoma highways. From Woodward to just east of Enid, US-412 replaced SH-15. From there to the I-35 junction, it was <b>overlaid</b> on US-64; east of I-35, the designation {{was applied to}} the Cimarron Turnpike. US-412 continued east {{from the end of the}} turnpike along US-64. From there, it was routed through the Tulsa metropolitan freeway system along I-244 and I-44. East of Tulsa, the highway replaced SH-33 to the Arkansas line. The highway designations made redundant by US-412 were removed, effective December 12, 1988.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the French in the south {{threatened}} existing trade links that Carolina colonists had established into the interior, creating tension among all three powers. France and Spain, allies in this conflict, had been {{on opposite sides of}} the recently ended Nine Years' War. Conflicting territorial claims between Carolina and Florida south of the Savannah River were <b>overlaid</b> by animosity over religious divisions between the Roman Catholic Spanish and the Protestant English along the coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Reichsmarschall standard, on a light blue field, {{featured}} a gold German eagle grasping a wreath surmounted by two batons <b>overlaid</b> with a swastika. The reverse side of the flag had the Großkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ("Grand Cross of the Iron Cross") surrounded by a wreath between four Luftwaffe eagles. The flag was carried by a personal standard-bearer at all public occasions.|$|E
5|$|The {{gear and}} dial {{in the bottom}} left of the game screen {{is related to the}} Kotarou's Rewrite ability. The dial moves forward {{whenever}} this ability is used, and the outcome of certain scenes is determined by how much the dial has moved. Throughout most of the game, the text is presented in a dialog box on the lower portion of the game screen, but this is changed for the Terra scenario, where the text is <b>overlaid</b> across the entire screen.|$|E
5|$|The rising land {{beside the}} coast, between {{the valley and}} the eastern cliffs, is known as 'The Downs' (no {{relation}} to the North or South Downs). This area has been named a Site of Scientific Interest and a Special Protection Area for Birds. The whole of the north east Kent coast has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The geology of the town consists mainly of London Clay, <b>overlaid</b> with brickearth in the west. The sand and clay of The Downs are subject to landslips.|$|E
5|$|The {{types of}} prisoners were {{distinguishable}} by triangular pieces of cloth, called Winkel, sewn onto on their jackets below their prisoner number. Political prisoners had a red triangle, Jehovah's Witnesses had purple, criminals had green, and so on. The nationality of the inmate was indicated by a letter stitched onto the Winkel. Jews had a yellow triangle, <b>overlaid</b> {{by a second}} Winkel if they also fit into a second category. Uniquely at Auschwitz, prisoners were tattooed with their prisoner number, on the chest for Soviet prisoners of war and on the left arm for civilians.|$|E
5|$|This star is {{primarily}} {{composed of a}} carbon–oxygen mixture that was generated by helium fusion in the progenitor star. This is <b>overlaid</b> by an envelope of lighter elements, with the materials segregated by mass {{because of the high}} surface gravity. The outer atmosphere of Sirius B is now almost pure hydrogen—the element with the lowest mass—and no other elements are seen in its spectrum.|$|E
5|$|US136 was {{designated}} nationally in 1951. In the Keokuk area, it was <b>overlaid</b> upon US61 from west of Alexandria, Missouri, over the Des Moines River into Iowa, and into downtown Keokuk. South of downtown, it replaced Iowa161, which crossed the Mississippi River on the Keokuk Rail Bridge. Since its designation, the route has largely remained the same. However, {{the eastern end}} changed slightly {{with the opening of}} the Keokuk–Hamilton Bridge in 1985.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} special paint {{jobs have been}} carried out. In the mid-1990s, SAS started a scheme to cover MD-80 in single colors <b>overlaid</b> with small, white {{aircraft}} silhouettes, but the project was abandoned after two aircraft. As SAS {{was one of the}} main sponsors of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, it painted one aircraft in a Lillehammer '94 scheme. Similarly a Copenhagen '96 scheme was pained for Copenhagen's term as the European Capital of Culture. Since 2002, SAS has painted selected aircraft in a Star Alliance livery. With the delivery of the A319 in 2006, one aircraft was delivered in a retro Viking scheme.|$|E
5|$|A {{video of}} the Stockholm {{performance}} of the Final Fantasy VI Symphonic Poem was released on October 11, 2014, and a full album recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios was released on February 23, 2015 by Merregnon Studios. The album, along with the concerts themselves, were heavily praised, both {{for the quality of}} the performance and for the quality of the arrangements, which <b>overlaid</b> themes from multiple pieces rather than relying on a more traditional medley. The concert series was followed by Final Symphony II, a similar concert tour by Merregnon Studios which began in 2015 with music from Final Fantasy V, VII, IX, and XIII.|$|E
5|$|By 1936, several U.S. {{highways}} {{had been}} added to the system that took over parts of State Highway 8's route. US-62, added in 1930, took over the Lawton–Anadarko portion of the road. US-277 took over much of the remaining route between Randlett and Lawton. In addition, a US-70N had been created that <b>overlaid</b> US-277 between Randlett and the split with SH-5 west of Walters. These changes to the U.S. route system precipitated the truncation of SH-8 in 1936. On 1936-03-13, the section of the route between Anadarko and the state line was dropped. However, a new road between Anadarko and Cyril had been built; this became part of SH-8 and set the highway's southern terminus at its present location.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Knauf <b>overlaid</b> the Avatars of {{the fictional}} {{universe}} with an elaborate order of succession by blood, similar to the ascent of royal families. The descriptors Royals, King and Prince are replaced in the series with Vectori, Prophet and Prince. Female royals like Queens and Princesses {{do not have a}} fictional counterpart and are instead replaced with the concepts of the Alpha, the Omega and the Usher. These Wild Card Avatars have special rules in addition to, or replacing, the normal ones. Reviewers rarely focused on the significance of the mentioned Avataric terms and their implied characteristics in the story, despite detailed explanations by Knauf and the later public availability of Carnivàles Pitch Document, setting out the complex mythological structure.|$|E
5|$|Don't take it {{personally}} is a visual novel, or interactive fiction game {{where the majority of}} the story is told through still images of the speaking characters in front of anime-style backgrounds with text <b>overlaid.</b> The player's viewpoint follows one character, the teacher in a school, with the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other characters' statements. The player advances the conversations the teacher is in or witnesses at will, but cannot go backwards and has little control over what any of the characters, including the teacher, are saying except at a few key moments. At these points, the player is presented with two or three choices for what the teacher says; which option is chosen can change what path the plot takes, in either a minor or major way.|$|E
5|$|Following {{majority}} rule in early 1980, British Army trainers oversaw {{the integration of}} guerrilla fighters into a battalion structure <b>overlaid</b> on the existing Rhodesian armed forces. For the first year, a system was followed where the top-performing candidate became battalion commander. If {{he or she was}} from ZANLA, then his or her second-in-command was the top-performing ZIPRA candidate, and vice versa. This ensured a balance between the two movements in the command structure. From early 1981, this system was abandoned in favour of political appointments, and ZANLA and ZANU fighters consequently quickly formed the majority of battalion commanders in the ZNA.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{four new}} {{performances}} were scheduled, taking stage in Tokyo, Stockholm, and a reprise in Cologne. These performances featured slightly modified {{versions of the}} original arrangements, and like the original concerts, were sold out. Another performance was held in London in October 2016 by the London Symphony Orchestra. The original concert and the Tokyo concert both sparked the release of an album. These albums, along with the concerts themselves, were heavily praised, both {{for the quality of}} the performance and for the quality of Valtonen's arrangements, which <b>overlaid</b> themes from multiple pieces rather than relying on a traditional medley.|$|E
5|$|In New Hampshire {{the timber}} dispute was <b>overlaid</b> by ongoing {{disputes}} between local landowners and Samuel Allen, a London merchant who had acquired the territorial {{claims of the}} heirs of John Mason, the province's founder, and was pursuing them against those landowners. Allen, who had been commissioned governor of the province in 1692, only came to the colony in 1698 to take a direct interest in its affairs. During Bellomont's brief visit to New Hampshire in July and August 1699, Allen attempted to buy him to his side. Allen offered his daughter (with a large dowry) as a marriage match for the earl's son; Bellomont refused the offer.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to the flowing main theme, Khan's leitmotif {{was designed as a}} percussive texture that could be <b>overlaid</b> with other music and emphasized the character's insanity. The seven-note brass theme was echoplexed to emphasize the character's ruminations about the past while on Ceti Alpha V, but does not play fully until Reliants attack on the Enterprise. Many elements drew from Horner's previous work (a rhythm that accompanies Khan's theme during the surprise attack borrows from an attack theme from Wolfen, in turn influenced by Goldsmith's score for Alien). Musical moments from the original television series are also heard during investigation of the Regula space station and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite {{synthetic aperture}} radar images of a geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes {{that have taken place}} between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were <b>overlaid</b> on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E
5|$|Mary sits under a brocade canopy or {{cloth of}} honour, painted in brown hues which have since {{discoloured}} to dark green. The canopy hangs {{down to a}} wooden bench attached to the wall behind her. Mary's hair is loose and she wears an embroidered dress lined with fur. Around her neck is a light veil, and she {{is shown in the}} act of nursing. Her dress is a centrepiece of the panel, composed of a variety of blues <b>overlaid</b> with lead white and deep blue lapis lazuli highlights. The inner parts of her robe contain violet coloured fabrics, lined with greyish blues and purples.|$|E
5|$|Officially {{designated}} on 1924-08-24, {{the original}} route encompassed all of current SH-9 west of Blanchard. East of Blanchard, SH-9 followed a more northerly route. Bypassing Norman, SH-9 ran north to Oklahoma City before going east through Harrah, Meeker, Prague, Henryetta, and Checotah. The highway ended {{at the original}} State Highway 3 in Spiro. Upon {{the creation of the}} United States Numbered Routes system in 1926, the section between Oklahoma City and Warner was <b>overlaid</b> with U.S. Highway 266. Four years later in 1930, SH-9 was truncated to Chickasha. By this time, much of the route had become part of U.S. Highway 62.|$|E
5|$|The Appaloosa is an American horse breed {{best known}} for its {{colorful}} spotted coat pattern. There is a wide range of body types within the breed, stemming from the influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history. Each horse's color pattern is genetically the result of various spotting patterns <b>overlaid</b> on top of one of several recognized base coat colors. The color pattern of the Appaloosa is of interest to those who study equine coat color genetics, as it and several other physical characteristics are linked to the leopard complex mutation (LP). Appaloosas are prone to develop equine recurrent uveitis and congenital stationary night blindness; the latter has been linked to the leopard complex.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} flag of Singapore was adopted in 1959, the year Singapore became self-governing within the British Empire. It was reconfirmed as the {{national flag}} when the republic gained independence on 9 August 1965. Prior to its independence, {{it was the only}} state flag in Malaysia not to have a 1:2 ratio. The design is a horizontal bicolour of red above white, <b>overlaid</b> in the canton (upper-left quadrant) by a white crescent moon facing a pentagon of five small white five-pointed stars. The elements of the flag denote a young nation on the ascendant, universal brotherhood and equality, and national ideals.|$|E
5|$|The script {{called for}} the probe to {{vaporize}} the Earth's oceans, generating heavy cloud cover. While effects cinematographer Don Dow {{wanted to go to}} sea and record plumes of water created by exploding detonating cords in the water, the team decided to create the probe's climatic effect in another way after a government fishing agency voiced concerns for the welfare of marine life in the area. The team used a combination of baking soda and cloud tank effects; the swirling mist created by the water-filled tank was shot on black velvet, and color and dynamic swirls were added by injecting paint into the tank. These shots were composited onto a painting of the Earth along with <b>overlaid</b> lightning effects, created by double-exposing lights as they moved across the screen.|$|E
5|$|This period saw {{dramatic}} changes in the geography of language. Modern linguists divide the Celtic languages into two major groups, the P-Celtic, from which Welsh, Breton and Cornish derive and the Q-Celtic, from which comes Irish, Manx and Gaelic. The Pictish language remains enigmatic, since the Picts had no written script of their own and all that survives are place names and some isolated inscriptions in Irish ogham script. Most modern linguists accept that, although the nature and unity of Pictish language is unclear, it belonged to the former group. Historical sources, as well as place name evidence, indicate {{the ways in which the}} Pictish language in the north and Cumbric languages in the south were <b>overlaid</b> and replaced by Gaelic, English and later Norse in this period.|$|E
5|$|From {{the reign}} of David I (r. 1124–53), there is {{evidence}} of burghs, particularly on the east coast, which are the first identifiable towns in Scotland. Probably based on existing settlements, they grew in number and significance through the Medieval period. More than 50 royal burghs are known to have been established {{by the end of the}} thirteenth century and a similar number of baronial and ecclesiastical burghs were created between 1450 and 1516, acting as focal points for administration, as well as local and international trade. In the early Middle Ages the country was divided between speakers of Gaelic, Pictish, Cumbric and English. Over the next few centuries Cumbric and Pictish were gradually <b>overlaid</b> and replaced by Gaelic, English and Norse. From at least {{the reign of}} David I, Gaelic was replaced by French as the language of the court and nobility. In the late Middle Ages Scots, derived mainly from Old English, became the dominant language.|$|E
5|$|Marigene Butler, head {{conservator}} at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, oversaw a multi-national {{research project}} between 1983 and 1989. Her team investigated the provenance {{of the two}} paintings and relationships between them through technical analyses. At that time both paintings underwent further restorations. They examined the wooden supports, parchment fibres and priming layers of the Philadelphia painting. A sample of paint {{was taken from the}} seraph-Christ's wings; analysis found particles of pure ultramarine, the most expensive pigment at the time. The team identified red organic lake in the stigmata wounds, and vermilion and lead white on Francis's cheeks. Infrared reflectography found a base layer of paint <b>overlaid</b> with hatching and fine brush strokes on an additional layer. The greenery was painted with a copper resinate that over time has darkened to brown. The mountains and sky were painted with ultramarine and lead white. Compared to the Turin painting, the Philadelphia version shows little evidence of underdrawing.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{linguists}} divide Celtic languages {{into two}} major groups: the P-Celtic, {{from which the}} Brythonic languages– Welsh, Breton, Cornish and Cumbric derive– and the Q-Celtic, from which come the Goidelic languages– Irish, Manx and Gaelic. The Pictish language remains enigmatic, since the Picts had no written script {{of their own and}} all that survives are place names and some isolated inscriptions in Irish ogham script. Most modern linguists accept that, although the nature and unity of Pictish language is unclear, it belonged to the former group. Historical sources, as well as place-name evidence, indicate {{the ways in which the}} Pictish language in the north and Cumbric languages in the south were <b>overlaid</b> and replaced by Gaelic, Old English and later Norse in this period. By the High Middle Ages the majority of people within Scotland spoke the Gaelic language, then simply called Scottish, or in Latin, lingua Scotica.|$|E
