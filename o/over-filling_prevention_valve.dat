50|$|On {{the morning}} of Monday, September 25, 2006 over 300,000 gallons of water was {{discovered}} {{in the basement of}} Klein Elementary School. The cause was attributed to debris in the public water system that found its way into the backflow <b>prevention</b> <b>valve</b> located just inside of the building. While the valve functioned properly, due to its location within the building, it was left in an open position for an estimated 55 hours which was more than enough time to fill the basement. For an unknown reason, the circuit breakers did not trip, and when the water submerged all of the electrical panels, the electricity flow heated the water to about 105 degrees. As a result, all of the equipment in that area was destroyed, submerged under 14 feet of water. The building was immediately closed, and remained closed for about one month, while the students were moved to Rolling Ridge Elementary (K-4th grades) and the Junior High School (5th and 6th grades). The cost to the school district was nearly $250,000 to replace the destroyed equipment. Through the cooperation of area contractors, the building was able to reopen on Monday, October 23, 2006.|$|R
50|$|A {{dramatic}} break {{somewhere along}} the length of an 8,750-foot injection well casing resulted in a gigantic methane eruption from the field on October 23, 2015, spewing on the order of 60 million cubic feet of methane per day at first, before the pressure was reduced. The well, Standard Sesnon 25 ("SS 25") had originally been installed in 1953, and reworked as a gas injection well in 1973, but lacked a blowout <b>prevention</b> <b>valve,</b> as it had not been considered a priority given the well's position, at the time, far from a populated area. Fallout from the methane cloud, in the form of oily droplets and persistent noxious odors, caused the evacuation of over 6,000 families, who have relocated to hotels and other rentals at SoCalGas's expense throughout the region. Another 10,000 homes received air-purification systems at the company’s expense. On Dec. 4, 2015, SoCalGas commenced drilling a relief well to stop the natural gas blowout by plugging the damaged well at its base. The relief well intercepted the base of the well on Feb. 11, 2016, and the company began pumping heavy fluids to temporarily control the flow of gas out of the well. SoCalGas was able to plug the leak permanently on February 18, 2016. Overall the well is estimated to have released over 100,000 metric tons of natural gas, the largest such release in U.S. history.|$|R
40|$|Lara Gharibeh, Mona Nemer Molecular Genetics and Cardiac Regeneration Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada Abstract: Over {{the past}} years, human and {{molecular}} genetic studies have provided {{new understanding of}} valve development and the molecular pathogenesis of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease. BAV is an autosomal dominant disease with incomplete penetrance and is found to affect 1 %– 2 % of the population. It can occur in isolation or coexists with other congenital heart diseases such as ventricular septal defect and tetralogy of fallot. BAV is {{a risk factor for}} premature cardiovascular disease and can lead to severe complications affecting the aorta and the valves. To date, NOTCH 1 and GATA 5 are the only genes linked to human BAV, and the genetic basis for most BAVs remains unidentified. Large-scale screening as well as whole exome sequencing studies hold promise for uncovering BAV-causing genes. Similarly, molecular analysis of valve development in animal models is needed for better insight of normal and pathologic valve formation. Together, these approaches will undoubtedly accelerate discovery of disease-causing genes opening the way for early diagnosis of BAV and <b>prevention</b> of <b>valve</b> degeneration and cardiovascular complications.

40|$|Bypass {{operation}} {{with the aid}} of a special bypass valve is an important part of present-day schemes of protection for h. v. d. c. transmission systems. In this paper, the possibility of using two valves connected to any phase in the bridge convertor for the purpose of bypass operation is studied. The scheme is based on the use of logic circuits in conjunction with modified methods of fault detection. Analysis of the faults in a d. c. transmission system is carried out with the object of determining the requirements of such a logic-circuit control system. An outline of the scheme for the logic-circuit control of the bypass operation for both rectifier and invertor bridges is then given. Finally, conclusions are drawn regarding the advantages of such a system, which include reduction in the number of <b>valves,</b> <b>prevention</b> of severe faults and fast clearance of faults, in addition to the immediate location of the fault and its nature...|$|R
40|$|Dystrophic {{mineralization}} {{remains the}} leading cause of stenotic or regurgitant failure in native human and porcine bioprosthetic heart valves. We hypothesized that cellular expression of noncollagenous matrix proteins (osteopontin, osteocalcin, and osteonectin) that regulate skeletal mineralization may orchestrate valvular calcification. Porcine bioprosthetic heart valves and native human heart valves obtained during replacement surgery were analyzed for cells, matrix proteins that regulate mineralization, and vessels. Cell accumulation and calcification were correlated for both valve types (rho = 0. 75, P = 0. 01, native; rho = 0. 42, P = 0. 08, bioprosthetic). Osteopontin expression correlated with cell accumulation (rho = 0. 58, P = 0. 04) and calcification (rho = 0. 52, P = 0. 06) for bioprosthetic valves. Osteocalcin expression correlated with calcification (rho = 0. 77, P = 0. 04) and cell accumulation (rho = 0. 69, P = 0. 07) in native valves. Comparisons of calcified versus noncalcified native and bioprosthetic valves for averaged total matrix protein mRNA signal score revealed increased noncollagenous proteins mRNA levels in calcified valves (P = 0. 07, group I vs. group II; P = 0. 02, group III vs. group IV). When stratified according to positive versus negative mRNA signal status, both calcified bioprosthetic valves (P = 0. 03) and calcified native valves (P = 0. 01) were significantly more positive for noncollagenous proteins mRNA than their noncalcified counterparts. Local cell-associated expression of proteins regulating mineralization suggests a highly coordinated mechanism of bioprosthetic and native valve calcification analogous to physiologic bone mineralization. Modulation of cellular infiltration or cellular expression of matrix proteins that regulate mineralization, may offer an effective therapeutic approach to the <b>prevention</b> of <b>valve</b> failure secondary to calcification...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate objectively the incidence of Helicobacter pylori infection and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in patients following heart valve replacement surgery. Since the discovery of Helicobacter pylori, its association with gastritis, peptic ulceration and upper GI bleed have been extensively studied. Anticoagulation of patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses is a prerequisite for the <b>prevention</b> of <b>valve</b> thrombosis and thrombo-embolic events. However anticoagulation can have its complications, notably that of upper GI bleeding. Methods: Patients were assessed in routine postoperative outpatient clinics following cardiac valve replacement surgery. This assessment comprised initially of a questionnaire reflecting the symptomatology of upper GI bleeding and its subsequent management. With informed consent, a small sample of blood was obtained by stilette. The Helicobacter pylori status was assessed by measuring the presence of antibodies (immunoglobins) to Helicobacter pylori in a commercially available test kit, the Rapid Helisal Test. In this preliminary study 150 consecutive patients were scrutinised and their responses to the questionnaire were collected and compared with the Helisal test. Results: From the 150 patients studied, 37 patients were found to be positive to the Helisal test for Helicobacter pylori infection, representing 24. 6 % of all the cohorts. Of these 37 patients, eight gave a positive history of upper GI bleed; five requiring hospital admission with three requiring urgent upper GI endoscopy. Although these eight patients represent only 4. 4 % of the total group, it is significant to note that this represents 21. 6 % of those patients found to be Helicobacter pylori positive. There were no GI complications in any of those tested negative. There was an increasing incidence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the older age group o...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Dacron sewing ring {{material}} of the St. Jude Medical mechanical heart valve (St. Jude Medical, Inc., St. Paul, Minn.) was passively impregnated with rifampicin (60 mg/ml) both in its unsealed state and after sealing by {{the methods of}} preclotting in blood, autoclaving in blood, and autoclaving in 20 % albumin. Antistaphylococcal activity in the Dacron material was assessed immediately after rifampicin impregnation and at regular periods up to 5 days after implantation into the goat aorta. When the Dacron material had been sealed by autoclaving in blood and autoclaving in 20 % albumin significant retention of antistaphylococcal activity was found after 5 days in vivo. Best results were obtained {{with the use of}} autoclaved blood (p < 0. 05). We also compared these results with those obtained from impregnating commercially available gelatin-sealed (Gelseal) and collagen-sealed (Hemashield) Dacron material with rifampicin. Although antistaphylococcal activity was equivalent immediately after rifampicin impregnation, after 4 days in vivo the activity was negligible in Gelseal material (p < 0. 05) and could not be demonstrated in Hemashield material. Rifampicin impregnation of the intact St. Jude Medical mechanical valve sewing ring may have an application in the <b>prevention</b> of prosthetic <b>valve</b> endocarditis and a clinical protocol is suggested.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to unveil initiating mechanisms of aortic valve disease, a serious and prevalent cardiovascular pathology affecting 2. 8 % of Americans {{over the age of}} 75. Currently, valve disease has no known causes and no existing treatments except for cardiothoracic surgery. Identification of initiating mechanisms will lead to new diagnostic markers and treatment strategies that would allow for early intervention and eventually the <b>prevention</b> of <b>valve</b> disease. This work primarily focuses on the influence of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-[alpha] (TNF[alpha]) on the endothelial cells that line the aortic valve. By focusing on inflammation and the endothelium, both "first responders" to disease conditions in the valve environment, we hoped to unveil new mechanisms that could govern early stages of the disease. In this thesis, we have demonstrated that TNF[alpha] causes adult valve endothelial cells to produce destructive free radicals, dysregulating the delicate oxidate stress state of the valve. TNF[alpha] also drives endothelial cells to become mesenchymal via NF[kappa]B signaling, a reactivation of an embryonic pathway important to shaping the valve leaflets in utero. We further found that NF[kappa]B signaling drives endothelial participation in the later stages of valve calcification, showing in vivo that NF[kappa]B is a critical mediator of valve dysfunction. We have also demonstrated a role for the stem cell transcription factor Oct 4 in governing how valve endothelial cells change phenotype throughout disease. These findings have led to improved understanding of how NF[kappa]B and Oct 4 govern interstitial cell calcification, in the later stages of valve disease. Finally, we have used the biomechanical engineering strengths of our lab to investigate how the regulation of valve interstitial cell contractility is crucial to progression of calcification in the valve. My hope is that the results presented in this thesis will create a basic science foundation for the development of diagnostics and therapies to help patients suffering from aortic valve disease, especially those ineligible for surgical amelioration. Our in vitro and in vivo findings regarding the role of inflammation in endothelial dysfunction provide new evidence for the design of drugs targeting the NF[kappa]B pathway for aortic valve disease. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{development}} and progression of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) shares {{a number of}} similarities with atherosclerosis. Recently we could demonstrate that regular exercise training (ET) as primary <b>prevention</b> prevents aortic <b>valve</b> disease in LDL-receptor deficient (LDLR 2 / 2) mice. We aimed to investigate the impact of exercise training on the progression of CAVD in LDLR 2 / 2 mice {{in the setting of}} secondary prevention Methods and Results: Sixty-four LDLR 2 / 2 mice were fed with high cholesterol diet to induce aortic valve sclerosis. Thereafter the animals were divided into 3 groups: group 1 continuing on high cholesterol diet, group 2 continuing with cholesterol diet plus 1 h ET per day, group 3 continuing with normal mouse chow. After another 16 weeks the animal were sacrificed. Histological analysis of the aortic valve thickness demonstrated {{no significant difference between the}} three groups (control 98. 364. 5 mm, ET 88. 266. 6 mm, change in diet 87. 564. 0). Immunohistochemical staining for endothelial cells revealed a disrupted endothelial cell layer to the same extend in all groups. Furthermore no difference between the groups was evident with respect to the expression of inflammatory, fibroblastic and osteoblastic markers. Conclusion: Based on the present study we have to conclude that once the development of a CAVD is initiated, exercise training or a change in diet does not have the potential to attenuate the progress of the CAVD...|$|R

Our aim {{was to determine the}} prevalence of VC in our maintenance hemodialysis (HD) population, and the optimal Ca x P value that most accurately predicted the presence of VC after controlling for comorbidities. MethodsThis was a cross-sectional observational study of a cohort of 52 stable patients on maintenance HD for more than 12 months. Mean 12 months serum biochemical data (calcium, phosphorus, PTH, lipids) and M-mode 2 D echocardiogram were used to evaluate {{the presence or absence of}} mitral and aortic VC and ventricular geometry. ResultsTwenty patients (38. 4 %) presented with VC. Patients with VC were more commonly diabetic and showed higher levels of serum phosphorus, Ca x P product, total and LDL cholesterol, and poor ventricular geometry, as compared to patients without VC. Moreover, they required higher doses of both CaCO 3 and Al(OH) 3. Logistic regression analysis showed that VC was independently influenced by age, Ca x P, and diabetes. ROC curves illustrated that a Ca x P> 43 mg 2 /dL 2 was the optimal value in terms of sensitivity and specificity for predicting the presence of VC in our patient population. ConclusionThese findings highlight the importance of applying more vigorous measures for Ca x P control...|$|R
