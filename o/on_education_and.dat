5|$|Between 1907 and 1917, the League for Women's Equal Rights was {{the most}} {{important}} feminist organization in Russia. Like the Russian Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society, it was focused <b>on</b> <b>education</b> <b>and</b> social welfare, but it also pushed for equal rights for women, including suffrage, equal inheritance, and an end to passport restrictions. The 1917 Revolution, catalyzed in part by women workers' demonstrations, generated a surge of membership in the organization. In the same year, because of the society's continued lobbying, Russia became the first major world power to grant women the right to vote.|$|E

These views gained him some critics, as he was seen as a priest who had abandoned religion.|$|E

5|$|A liberal {{member of}} Congress, Tierney voted {{along with other}} Democratic Representatives from Massachusetts. He sat on the House Committee <b>on</b> <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> Labor, where his {{priorities}} included green energy and increased college access.

5|$|Article {{five of the}} Constitution {{declared}} Catholicism to be {{the state}} religion. However, the clergy had long been understaffed, undisciplined and poorly educated, all of {{which led to a}} general loss of respect for the Catholic Church. During PedroII's reign, the Imperial government embarked upon a program of reform designed to address these deficiencies. As Catholicism was the official religion, the Emperor exercised a great deal of control over Church affairs and paid clerical salaries, appointed parish priests, nominated bishops, ratified papal bulls and supervised seminaries. In pursuing reform, the government selected bishops whose moral fitness, stance <b>on</b> <b>education</b> <b>and</b> support for reform met with their approval. However, as more capable men began to fill the clerical ranks, resentment of government control over the Church increased. Catholic clerics moved closer to the Pope and his doctrines. This resulted in the Religious Question, a series of clashes during the 1870s between the clergy and the government, since the former wanted a more direct relationship with Rome and the latter sought to maintain its oversight of church affairs.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} were: 1) determining the direct effect of government spending <b>on</b> <b>education,</b> health <b>and</b> infrastructure to economic growth and human development index, 2) investigating the direct impact of economic growth on the human development index, 3) describing the indirect consequence of government spending <b>on</b> the sector <b>education,</b> health <b>and</b> infrastructure to the human development index through economic growth. In order to examine the hypothesis testing, the researcher employed path analysis and used the data derived from government spending files which comprised the expenditures <b>on</b> <b>education,</b> health <b>and</b> infrastructure, human development index and economic growth from 1997 up to 2011. The analysis showed {{that there is a}} direct effect of government spending <b>on</b> <b>education,</b> health <b>and</b> infrastructure to the human development index and economic growth and indirect influences of the government expenditure <b>on</b> <b>education,</b> health <b>and</b> infrastructure to the human development index through economic growth. ...|$|R

5|$|Castro's {{government}} emphasised social {{projects to}} improve Cuba's standard of living, often {{to the detriment}} of economic development. Major emphasis was placed <b>on</b> <b>education,</b> <b>and</b> during the first 30 months of Castro's government, more classrooms were opened than in the previous 30 years. The Cuban primary education system offered a work-study program, with half of the time spent in the classroom, and the other half in a productive activity. Health care was nationalized and expanded, with rural health centers and urban polyclinics opening up across the island to offer free medical aid. Universal vaccination against childhood diseases was implemented, and infant mortality rates were reduced dramatically. A third part of this social program was the improvement of infrastructure. Within {{the first six months of}} Castro's government, 600 miles of roads were built across the island, while $300 million was spent on water and sanitation projects. Over 800 houses were constructed every month in the early years of the administration in an effort to cut homelessness, while nurseries and day-care centers were opened for children and other centers opened for the disabled and elderly.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 85th United States Congress, McGovern {{became a}} member of the House Committee <b>on</b> <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> Labor. As a representative, McGovern was {{attentive}} to his district. He became a staunch supporter of higher commodity prices, farm price supports, grain storage programs, and beef import controls, believing that such stored commodities programs guarded against drought and similar emergencies. He favored rural development, federal aid to small business and to education, and medical coverage for the aged under Social Security. In 1957, he traveled and studied conditions in the Middle East under a fellowship from the American Christian Palestine Committee. McGovern first allied with the Kennedy family by supporting a House version of Senator John F. Kennedy's eventually unsuccessful labor reform bill.|$|E

5|$|Within {{months of}} {{arriving}} in Washington, D.C., Fletcher {{was selected as}} the leadership liaison for the 17-member freshman class of Republican legislators. He was appointed to the Committee <b>on</b> <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> Workforce, and John Boehner, chair of the committee's employer/employee relations subcommittee, chose Fletcher as his vice-chair. The committee's purpose is to oversee the rules for employer-paid health plans, among other issues, and although it is rare for a freshman legislator to attain a committee leadership post, Boehner cited Fletcher's experience in the medical field and work on reforming the Kentucky health care system as reasons for the appointment. Fletcher also served {{as a member of the}} House Committees on the Budget and Agriculture. In June 1999, he sponsored an amendment to a youth violence bill that allowed school districts to use federal funds to develop curricula which included elements designed to promote and enhance students' moral character; the amendment passed 422—1. Later, Fletcher was assigned to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and was selected as chairman of the Policy Subcommittee on Health.|$|E
