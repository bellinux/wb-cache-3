5|$|For some, {{being a part}} of a {{community}} is an important resource because they often report having felt ostracized. Although <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> exist, affiliation with <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> vary. Some question the concept of online community, while others depend on the online asexual community heavily for support. Elizabeth Abbott posits that there has always been an asexual element in the population, but that asexual people kept a low profile. While the failure to consummate marriage was seen as an insult to the sacrament of marriage in medieval Europe, and has sometimes been used as grounds for divorce or to rule a marriage void, asexuality, unlike homosexuality, has never been illegal, and it has usually gone unnoticed. However, in the 21st century, the anonymity of online communication and general popularity of social networking online has facilitated the formation of {{a community}} built around a common asexual identity.|$|E
5|$|The Internet {{has helped}} autistic {{individuals}} bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing {{that they find}} so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> and work remotely. Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being.|$|E
5|$|The Internet is of {{interest}} to sociologists in various ways; most practically {{as a tool for}} research and as a discussion platform. The sociology of the Internet in the broad sense regards the analysis of <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> (e.g. newsgroups, social networking sites) and virtual worlds, thus there is often overlap with community sociology. <b>Online</b> <b>communities</b> may be studied statistically through network analysis or interpreted qualitatively through virtual ethnography. Moreover, organizational change is catalysed through new media, thereby influencing social change at-large, perhaps forming the framework for a transformation from an industrial to an informational society. One notable text is Manuel Castells' The Internet Galaxy—the title of which forms an inter-textual reference to Marshall McLuhan's The Gutenberg Galaxy. Closely related to the sociology of the Internet, is digital sociology, which expands the scope of study to address not only the internet but also the impact of the other digital media and devices that have emerged since {{the first decade of the}} twenty-first century.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century some groups reached {{mainstream}} popularity. There are Christian metal bands that perform virtually every subgenre of metal. The Christian metal movement has spread worldwide since it emerged in the early 1980s, and there are now hundreds of active Christian metal bands. Inspired by the metal revival, many 1980s bands have made comebacks including Saint, Bloodgood and Stryper. In October 2004, Doug Van Pelt brought Heaven's Metal back as its own fanzine. The Internet has had a significant role on the revival of Christian metal as well. Many websites and <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> are dedicated to discussions about Christian metal's music, events, and bands.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of factitious disorders in online venues is made easier by {{the availability of}} medical literature on the Internet, the anonymous and malleable nature of online identities, {{and the existence of}} communication forums established {{for the sole purpose of}} giving support to members facing significant health or psychological problems. Several high-profile cases have demonstrated behavior patterns which are common among those who pose as gravely ill or as victims of violence, or whose deaths are announced to online forums. The virtual communities that were created to give support, as well as general non-medical communities, often express genuine sympathy and grief for the purported victims. When fabrications are suspected or confirmed, the ensuing discussion can create schisms in <b>online</b> <b>communities,</b> destroying some and altering the trusting nature of individual members in others.|$|E
5|$|From 1999 to 2001 a 40-year-old {{homemaker}} named Debbie Swenson perpetrated a ruse {{under the}} identity Kaycee Nicole, a 19-year-old woman in Kansas who shared {{the details of}} her battles with leukemia online. The Guardian newspaper reported that millions of Internet users read the fictional blog, as well as Swenson's own blog, in which she posed as Kaycee Nicole's mother, describing the trials of living with an intelligent and optimistic daughter who was dying. On May 16, 2001, Kaycee Nicole's death of an aneurysm was announced, shocking her readers and causing them intense grief. Soon however, Swenson caused skepticism in <b>online</b> <b>communities.</b> Although many cards and gifts had been previously sent, she refused to accept more. People began to learn that no one named Kaycee Nicole lived in Kansas, had been enrolled in schools, or admitted to local hospitals, and no obituary had been printed. The photo representing the girl was found to be that of a basketball player from Gracemont, Oklahoma, who was alive. After repeated questioning, Swenson posted that she had woven the stories of three cancer patients to create the character of Kaycee Nicole, who had never existed.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} <b>online</b> brand <b>communities</b> from a brand management perspective. The {{purpose of this study}} is to contribute to understanding of <b>online</b> brand <b>communities</b> by examining differences in brand-sponsored and consumer-generated <b>online</b> brand <b>communities,</b> and to extend research into <b>online</b> brand <b>communities</b> by examining <b>online</b> brand <b>communities</b> for a sports brand. The first phase of this study investigates how consumption practices differ in brand-sponsored and consumer-generated <b>online</b> brand <b>communities.</b> <b>Online</b> brand <b>communities</b> for the All Blacks brand were selected as a case study for this research. The All Blacks brand-sponsored and consumer-generated <b>online</b> brand <b>communities</b> were observed for eight weeks and afterwards discussions in both communities were analysed for two weeks to identify consumption practices. Ethical issues pertinent to this research design meant raw comments and discussions could not be collected and instead discussions were immediately analysed through a coding process. The second phase of this study investigates marketing industry expert views on brand-sponsored and consumer-generated <b>online</b> brand <b>communities.</b> Interviews with three representatives from service and sports organisations were held. The findings from this research contribute to literature on <b>online</b> brand <b>communities</b> by demonstrating brand-sponsored and consumer-generated <b>online</b> brand <b>communities</b> differ in consumption practices, language, self-expression, modes of interaction, and legitimacy. This study also extends research into <b>online</b> brand <b>communities</b> by investigating <b>online</b> brand <b>communities</b> for sports brands. Findings imply there are minimal differences between <b>online</b> brand <b>communities</b> for service or sports brands compared with <b>online</b> brand <b>communities</b> for goods. The outcomes from this research may also have a number of implications for marketers, hoping to capitalise on the growth of <b>online</b> brand <b>communities...</b>|$|R

40|$|Conceptual {{blind spots}} persist {{when it comes}} to {{understanding}} the value of consumptive dimensions of participation, such as lurking, in <b>online</b> <b>community.</b> This article uses a practice-theoretical lens to conceptualize the consumptive moments of <b>online</b> <b>community</b> practices and explores how they shape different value outcomes. Building on a mixed-method investigation through two studies within an <b>online</b> gardening <b>community,</b> findings reveal two specific consumptive moments, direct and vicarious, and their differential role in the creation of community engagement and vitality. These findings suggest that lurking is not adequately described as a unidimensional construct, but is best understood as vicarious consumptive moments of specific <b>online</b> <b>community</b> practices with distinctive value outcomes. Implications for research on <b>online</b> consumption <b>community</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{a history of}} how <b>online</b> <b>community</b> has been represented in business discourse.

Based upon the in-depth, interpretive case study of an <b>online</b> <b>community</b> of retail bankers, it develops a grounded theory that reveals that participants in an <b>online</b> <b>community</b> deal with new taint by protecting their occupation's identity but not by attempting to repair its external image. In the investigated community, reactions progressed from rejecting the taint to distancing from it and, finally, resigning to it. Overall, the dynamics of an occupational <b>online</b> <b>community</b> reveal that the objective of protecting the existing identity of its members supersede that of taking a more proactive stance to address the identity threat and attempt to influence new regulations affecting the occupation. ...|$|R
