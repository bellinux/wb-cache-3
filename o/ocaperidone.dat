40|$|The mixed serotonin- 2 /dopamine-D 2 antagonists nspendone and <b>ocaperidone</b> were {{compared}} with the specific D 2 antagonist halopendol {{for their ability to}} antagonize amphetamine (1 0 mg/ kg, s. c.

Four successive stages of amphetamine antagonism were differentiated: 1) disinhibition: reversal of stationary stereotypy into the hyperactivity normally observed with lower doses of amphetamine; 2) inhibition: the first significant reduction of activity; 3) normalization: reduction of activity to the level of nonamphetaminized rats; and 4) suppression: reduction of activity to 50 % of the level of nonam-phetaminized rats. <b>Ocaperidone</b> and nsperidone were equipotent with halopendol for disinhibition (0. 0062 - 0. 01 1 mg/kg).

40|$|The {{tremendous}} {{advances in}} understanding the neurobiological circuits involved in schizophrenia have not translated into more effective treatments. An alternative strategy {{is to use a}} recently published ‘Quantitative Systems Pharmacology’ computer-based mechanistic disease model of cortical/subcortical and striatal circuits based upon preclinical physiology, human pathology and pharmacology. The physiology of 27 relevant dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate-mediated targets is calibrated using retrospective clinical data on 24 different antipsychotics. The model was challenged to predict quantitatively the clinical outcome in a blinded fashion of two experimental antipsychotic drugs; JNJ 37822681, a highly selective low-affinity dopamine D 2 antagonist and <b>ocaperidone,</b> a very high affinity dopamine D 2 antagonist, using only pharmacology and human positron emission tomography (PET) imaging data. The model correctly predicted the lower performance of JNJ 37822681 on the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) total score and the higher extra-pyramidal symptom (EPS) liability compared to olanzapine and the relative performance of <b>ocaperidone</b> against olanzapine, but did not predict the absolute PANSS total score outcome and EPS liability for <b>ocaperidone,</b> possibly due to placebo responses and EPS assessment methods. Because of its virtual nature, this modeling approach can support central nervous system research and development by accounting for unique human drug properties, such as human metabolites, exposure, genotypes and off-target effects and can be a helpful tool for dru...|$|E
40|$|The 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) 1 D/ 1 B receptors {{have gained}} {{particular}} interest as potential targets {{for treatment of}} migraine and depression. G-protein coupling and other intrinsic properties of the human 5 -HT 1 D receptor were studied using a baculovirus-based expression system in Sf 9 cells. Coexpression of the human 5 -HT 1 D receptor with G alpha(i 1), alpha(i 2), alpha(i 3),or G alpha(o) -proteins and G beta(1) gamma(2) -subunits reconstituted a Gpp(NH) p-sensitive, high affinity binding of [H- 3] 5 -HT to this receptor, whereas the G alpha(q) beta(1) gamma(2) heterotrimer was ineffective in this respect. Competition of [H- 3] 5 -HT binding by various compounds confirmed that coexpression of the human 5 -HT 1 D receptor with G alpha(i/o) beta(1) gamma(2) reconstitutes the receptor in a high affinity agonist binding state, having the same pharmacological profile as the receptor expressed in mammalian cells. Binding of the antagonist <b>ocaperidone</b> to the human 5 -HT 1 D receptor in coupled or noncoupled state was analyzed. This compound competed with [H- 3] 5 -HT binding more potently on the human 5 -HT 1 D receptor in the noncoupled state, showing its inverse agonistic character. <b>Ocaperidone</b> acted as a competitive inhibitor of [H- 3] 5 -HT binding when tested with the coupled receptor form but not so when tested with the noncoupled receptor preparation. Finally, [S- 35]GTP gamma S binding experiments using the inverse agonist <b>ocaperidone</b> revealed {{a high level of}} constitutive activity of the human 5 -HT 1 D receptor. Taken together, the reconstitution of the human 5 -HT 1 D receptor-G-protein coupling using baculovirus-infected Sf 9 cells made possible the assessment of coupling specificity and the detection of different binding states of the receptor induced by G-protein coupling or ligand bindin...|$|E
40|$|Alniditan, a novel {{migraine}} abortive agent, is {{a potent}} 5 -HT 1 B/ 5 -HT 1 D receptor agonist of nM affinity. We compared the agonistic properties of alniditan, sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine on the cloned human 5 -HT 1 B receptor expressed at 200 [*]fmol[*]mg− 1 protein (Bmax) in non-induced L 929 sA cells, at 740 [*]fmol[*]mg− 1 protein in HEK[*] 293 and at 2300 [*]fmol[*]mg− 1 protein in mIFNβ-induced L 929 sA cells, and on the human cloned 5 -HT 1 D receptor expressed in C 6 glioma cells (Bmax 780 [*]fmol[*]mg− 1 protein). Sodium butyrate treatment increased the expression level of human (h) 5 -HT 1 B receptors in HEK[*] 293 cells and h 5 -HT 1 D receptors in C 6 glioma cells approximately 3 fold, the binding affinities of [3 H]- 5 -HT and [3 H]-alniditan were unaffected. Agonistic properties were evaluated based on inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation in the cells after stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin or isoproterenol. Alniditan, sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine were full agonists at the h 5 -HT 1 B receptor (IC 50 values were 1. 7, 20 and 2 [*]nM, respectively in HEK[*] 293 cells) and h 5 -HT 1 D receptors (IC 50 values of 1. 3, 2. 6 and 2. 2 [*]nM, respectively). At the h 5 -HT 1 B receptor the agonist potency of the compounds slightly increased with higher receptor density. The opposite was seen for antagonists (<b>ocaperidone,</b> risperidone and ritanserin). This comparative study demonstrated that alniditan was 10 times more potent than sumatriptan at the h 5 -HT 1 B receptor, and twice as potent at the h 5 -HT 1 D receptor. Dihydroergotamine was more potent an agonist at the h 5 -HT 1 B receptor when expressed at high and low level in L 929 sA cells (but not in HEK[*] 293 cells), and was less potent at the h 5 -HT 1 D receptor...|$|E
40|$|Alniditan {{is a new}} migraine-abortive agent. It is a benzopyran {{derivative}} {{and therefore}} structurally unrelated to sumatriptan and other indole-derivatives and to ergoline derivatives. The action of sumatriptan {{is thought to be}} mediated by 5 -hydroxy-tryptamine (5 -HT) (1 D) -type receptors. We investigated the receptor-binding profile in vitro of alniditan compared with sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine for 28 neurotransmitter receptor subtypes, several receptors for peptides and lipid-derived factors, ion channel-binding sites, and monoamine transporters. Alniditan revealed nanomolar affinity for calf substantia nigra 5 -HT 1 D and for cloned h 5 -HT 1 D alpha, h 5 -HT 1 D beta, and h 5 -HT 1 A receptors (K-i = 0. 8, 0. 4, 1. 1, and 3. 8 nM, respectively). Alniditan was more potent than sumatriptan at 5 -HT 1 D-type and 5 -HT 1 A receptors. Alniditan showed moderate-to-low or no affinity for other investigated receptors; sumatriptan showed additional binding to 5 -HT 1 F receptors. Dihydroergotamine had a much broader profile with high affinity for several 5 -HT, adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. In signal transduction assays using cells expressing recombinant h 5 -HT 1 D alpha, h 5 -HT 1 D beta, or h 5 -HT 1 A receptors, alniditan (like 5 -HT) was a full agonist for inhibition of stimulated adenylyl cyclase (IC 50 = 1. 1, 1. 3, and 74 nM, respectively, for alniditan). Therefore, in functional assays, the potency of alniditan was much higher at 5 -HT 1 D receptors than at 5 -HT 1 A receptors. We further compared the properties of [H- 3]alniditan, as a new radioligand for 5 -HT 1 D-type receptors, with those of [H- 3] 5 -HT in membrane preparations of calf substantia nigra, C 6 glioma cells expressing h 5 -HT 1 D alpha, and L 929 cells expressing h 5 -HT 1 D beta receptors. [H- 3]Alniditan revealed very rapid association and dissociation binding kinetics and showed slightly higher affinity (K-d = 1 - 2 nM) than [H- 3] 5 -HT. We investigated 25 compounds for inhibition of [H- 3]alniditan and [H- 3] 5 -HT binding in the three membrane preparations; K-i values of the radioligands were largely similar, although some subtle differences appeared. Most compounds did not differentiate between 5 -HT 1 D alpha and 5 -HT 1 D beta receptors, except methysergide, ritanserin, <b>ocaperidone,</b> risperidone, and ketanserin, which showed 10 - 60 -fold higher affinity for the 5 -HT 1 D alpha receptor. The K-i values of the compounds obtained with 5 -HT 1 D receptors in calf substantia nigra indicated that these receptors are of the 5 -HT 1 D alpha-type. We demonstrated that alniditan is a potent agonist at h 5 -HT 1 D alpha and h 5 -HT 1 D beta receptors; its properties probably underlie its cranial vasoconstrictive and antimigraine properties. status: publishe...|$|E
