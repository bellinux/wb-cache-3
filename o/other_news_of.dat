Miriam Lord of The Irish Times described him in this incarnation as [...] "looking and sounding like Drumcondra's answer to Rodney Dangerfield", while Lise Hand of the Irish Independent commented [...] "that {{he was surrounded by}} vegetables, ginger nuts and the disintegrated remnants of the dignity of his former office". When asked for an explanation by the Sunday World, Ahern replied that it was [...] "just a bit of craic" [...] and that [...] "you [...] get paid more [...] ".|$|E

60|$|I began a {{long letter}} {{to you in}} the impulse left by yours upon me, and then {{destroyed}} it by accident. That hindered me from writing as soon as I should have done, for indeed I am anxious to have <b>other</b> <b>news</b> <b>of</b> you, my dearest dear Miss Mitford, and to know, if possible, that you are a little better.... Tell me everything. Why, you looked really well last summer; and I want to see you looking well this summer, for we shall probably be in London in June--more's the pity, perhaps! The gladness I have in England is so leavened through and through with sadness that I incline to do with it as one does with the black bread of the monks of Vallombrosa, only pretend to eat it and drop it slyly under the table. If it were not for some ties I would say 'Farewell, England,' and never set foot on it again. There's always an east wind for me in England, whether the sun shines or not--the moral east wind which is colder than any other. But how dull to go on talking of the weather: Sia come vuole, as we say in Italy.|$|E
6000|$|Probably {{through long}} {{association}} with Mary Battle, the second-sighted servant, {{he had come}} to believe much in the supernatural world, and would tell how several times, arriving home with an unexpected guest, he had found the table set for three, and that he himself had dreamed of his brother's illness in Liverpool before he had <b>other</b> <b>news</b> <b>of</b> it. He saw me using images learned from Mathers to start reverie, and, though I held out for a long time, thinking him too old and habit-bound, he persuaded me to tell him their use, and from that on we experimented continually, and after a time I began to keep careful record. In summer he always had the same little house at Rosses Point, and it was there that he first became sensitive to the cabalistic symbols. There are some high sandhills and low cliffs, and I adopted the practice of walking by the seashore while he walked on cliff or sandhill; I, without speaking, would imagine the symbol, and he would notice what passed before his mind's eye, and in a short time he would practically never fail of the appropriate vision. In the symbols which are used certain colours are classified as [...] "actives," [...] while certain other colours are [...] "passives," [...] and I had soon discovered that if I used [...] "actives" [...] George Pollexfen would see nothing. I therefore gave him exercises to make him sensitive to those colours, and gradually we found ourselves well fitted for this work, and he began to take as lively an interest, as was possible to a nature given over to habit, in my plans for the Castle on the Rock.|$|E
