The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate whether HFE had similar gastro-protective effects in human subjects. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. To fulfill this purpose, a group of subjects with erosive gastritis were orally supplemented with the HFE or placebo for 4 weeks and efficacy and safety were measured. Primary outcome (number <b>of</b> <b>erosions,</b> endoscopic score and estimated cure rates <b>of</b> <b>erosions)</b> and the secondary outcomes (estimated improvement rates <b>of</b> <b>erosions,</b> subjects’ symptom questionnaires and blood profiles) before and after the 4 -week intervention period were compared. The HFE supplementation showed a significant reduction in number <b>of</b> <b>erosions</b> compared with placebo group. In subjects whose endoscopic score were 4 points (erosions more than 6) at baseline, HFE supplementation resulted in a significant decrease <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>erosions</b> compared with placebo group.

5|$|Continuing {{through the}} Cretaceous period {{and into the}} early Tertiary, there was {{uplifting}} {{in the area of}} the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Mountains, and the La Plata Mountains, which led to the formation of the Mesa Verde pediment with the help <b>of</b> <b>erosion.</b> Small channels of water ran across this formation depositing gravel. Later in the tertiary, the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused the isolation of the Mesa Verde pediment from surrounding rock. Today, since the climate is more arid, these erosional processes are slowed.|$|E

5|$|Downcutting and canyon {{widening}} continue {{today as}} the process <b>of</b> <b>erosion</b> continues to try to reduce the topography to sea level. In 1998 a flash flood temporarily increased the Virgin River's flow rate from 200 to 4,500ft³/s (6 to 125m³/s). Geologists estimate that the Virgin River can cut another thousand feet (300m) before it loses the ability to transport sediment to the Colorado River to the south. However, additional uplift will probably increase this figure.|$|E

This network of canyons, dubbed Vid Flumina, range in depth from 240 to 570m and have sides as steep as 40°. They are believed to have formed either by crustal uplifting, like Earth's Grand Canyon, or a lowering of sea level, or perhaps a combination of the two.

5|$|The Jurassic Coast {{is subject}} to severe weather {{conditions}} at times.

Reliable data <b>of</b> soil <b>erosion</b> are important to propose a proper method of soil conservation. Measurements of 137 Cs inventory allow obtaining both long-term mean value <b>of</b> soil <b>erosion</b> and spa-tial pattern <b>of</b> soil <b>erosion.</b> To obtain quantitative results <b>of</b> soil <b>erosion</b> from 137 Cs measurements one of the mathematical models must be used. Currently, there are many such models in circulation and the results of calculations <b>of</b> soil <b>erosion</b> depend not only on the particular model but also on values assumed for parameters of this model. This paper describes some problems related to calculating soil erosion and deposition based on 137 Cs data, namely, the influence of additional parameters on calculated soil erosion is considered. In par-ticular, we have considered the influence of values assumed for plough depth, γ factor, particle size correction factor, soil density and the contribution of the post-Chernobyl deposition to the total cae-sium deposition on the calculated soil erosion values. The calculations <b>of</b> soil <b>erosion</b> have been done for four, most commonly used models, using real caesium inventory data collected by the authors.
