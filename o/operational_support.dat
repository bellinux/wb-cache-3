5|$|No. 20 Squadron was {{reactivated}} on 1 April 2015 {{to support}} airfield operations at RAAF Base Woomera, South Australia. Consisting of nine uniformed personnel and one Australian Public Service member {{under the command}} of Squadron Leader Simon Bartlett, the squadron formed part of No. 96 Wing, a component of Combat Support Group (CSG). The airfield had previously been managed under the auspices of Aerospace <b>Operational</b> <b>Support</b> Group, but a command-and-control review commissioned by the Chief of Air Force recommended that, in common with other RAAF airfields, it should be administered by CSG. RAAF Base Woomera, incorporating Woomera Village, was one of two Air Force units formally established on 12 January 2015 as part of a reorganisation of the Woomera Range Complex, the other unit being RAAF Woomera Test Range.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{as part of}} an {{expansion}} of the number of Australian Army infantry battalions, the 2nd/4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment—then operating as a standard light infantry battalion—was delinked into separate battalions which resumed their original identities as the 2nd and 4th Battalions. The decision was then taken that the 4th Battalion would become a Regular Army commando unit and on 1 February 1997 the unit was renamed to 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (Commando) (4 RAR Cdo). The unit would be structured for both conventional operations and domestic counter-terrorism, with an initial establishment of a battalion headquarters, Tactical Assault Group, two commando companies, logistic support company, logistic support company, <b>operational</b> <b>support</b> company and a signal squadron. Regular serving members were given the opportunity to undertake special forces training provided by the Commando Training Wing of the Reserve 1st Commando Regiment, or elect to be posted to a conventional forces unit. No General Reserve positions existed in the new structure, and reserve members discharged or posted to reserve units. It was planned that 4 RAR (Cdo) would eventually take over the SASR counter terrorist role.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Joint Staff, and the services have taken steps to integrate <b>operational</b> contract <b>support</b> into planning for contingency operations. For example, in April 2011, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, working with the Joint Staff, revised the Guidance for the Employment of the Force to require planning for <b>operational</b> contract <b>support</b> in all phases of military operations. Further, in December 2011, the Department of Defense (DOD) revised an instruction and issued corresponding regulations establishing policies and procedures for <b>operational</b> contract <b>support.</b> The Army issued service-specific guidance that describes roles, responsibilities, and requirements to help integrate <b>operational</b> contract <b>support</b> into its planning efforts for contingency operations. However, the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force have not issued similar comprehensive guidance for integrating <b>operational</b> contract <b>support</b> throughout each service. Instead, these services have taken actions such as developing training and other individual efforts to familiarize servicemembers with <b>operational</b> contract <b>support.</b> According to service officials, one reason {{that they have not}} issued comprehensive guidance similar to the Army's guidance is because the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force have not been the lead service for contracting in recent operations. However, these services combined spent over a billion dollars for contracted services in Afghanistan in fiscal year 2011. Without specific, service-wide guidance, the other services' future planning efforts may not reflect {{the full extent of the}} use of contract support and the attendant cost and need for oversight. ...|$|R
