5|$|The {{season was}} the first to be filmed in Los Angeles, after {{production}} was moved from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This move was done largely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Duchovny, who wished to be closer to his wife, Téa Leoni. Series creator Chris Carter opposed the move, although series director Kim Manners and Anderson approved of it, although to a less-vocal degree than Duchovny. The first half of the season also saw Mimi Rogers and Chris Owens' characters—Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender, respectively—become recurring characters.|$|E

Eight years later, Shinnosuke succeeds allowing the four to reunite with their respective lovers.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1970s, the Pakistan Army was {{involved}} in fighting an uprising in the Province of Balochistan. Various Baloch factions wanted independence or at least greater provincial rights.

25|$|The {{underlying}} {{justifications for}} DADT {{have been subjected}} to increasing suspicion and outright rejection by the early 21st century. Mounting evidence obtained from the integration efforts of foreign militaries, surveys of U.S. military personnel, and studies conducted by the DoD gave credence to the view that the presence of open homosexuals within the military would not be detrimental at all to the armed forces. A DoD study conducted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in 2010 supports this most.|$|E

While announcing his resignation Kumar stated that he was resigning only to ensure that the functioning of Parliament is not stalled and added that the Honorable Supreme Court had not made any adverse comments against him.|$|E

Dot was paired romantically with pensioner Jim Branning, played by John Bardon and a slow courtship was featured, with Dot often {{shown to be}} outraged by Jim's advances, resulting in numerous rejections. Dot finally succumbed and accepted his marriage proposal in an episode that aired in November 2001; the scenes were filmed {{inside one of the}} carriages of the London Eye on the South Bank of the River Thames. Their wedding aired on 14 February 2002, Valentine's Day.

50|$|However, {{it is now}} {{recognised}} {{that the}} work as it survives today was authored by John, a fellow monk at Worcester, whose signature is found in two later entries (s.a. 1128 and 1138).

He dresses up as the traditional winter Christmas gift-bringer figure Belsnickel, cooks German food, and plays a game similar to [...] "Naughty or Nice". The festivities cause displeasure among all the employees save Jim and Pam, who are amused by Dwight's antics. Jim, however, announces he is leaving the party early to arrive in Philadelphia for his sports marketing job. In response, Dwight repeatedly hits Jim with his switch. When Meredith Palmer requests that Dwight use the switch on her buttocks, he ends the festivities in disgust, and a [...] "normal" [...] Christmas party is started. Although Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) tries to cheer him up, she too is saddened by Jim's absence. Jim returns later, having found that there is a 5 a.m. bus the next morning, and both Dwight and Pam are delighted by his return. During the party, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) fears that Jim has forgotten to include him in the new job in Philadelphia, and gets extremely drunk. When he goes to confront Jim, Jim—not knowing that Darryl was upset—excitedly tells him that he has arranged an interview for him. Darryl, appeased, turns around but passes out and crashes down on the catering table.|$|E
2500|$|In 1961, the quintet, {{now called}} the Marvels, entered a talent show contest <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> their teacher and ended up {{finishing}} in fourth place. Though only the first three winners were offered a trip to audition for the fledgling Motown label, two of the girls' schoolteachers advised that they be allowed to audition too. Upon auditioning for Motown executives including Brian Holland and Robert Bateman, they had a second audition with bigger staff including Smokey Robinson and the label president and founder, Berry Gordy, who while impressed with their vocal styles advised {{them to come back}} with their own composition. Returning to Inkster, Georgia Dobbins contacted a local musician named William Garrett, who had an unfinished blues composition titled [...] "Please Mr. Postman"; Garrett allowed Dobbins to use it as long as he received songwriting credit if the song became a hit. Despite having no previous songwriting experience, Dobbins took the song home and reshaped it overnight to reflect the teenage sound of doo-wop.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{submission}} of Lucania and the bringing back of hostages, Livy {{said that the}} Lucanians were willing to give hostages as a pledge of good faith. Cornell remarks that [...] "he intimation of that the Lucanians’ submission {{was the result of}} military action {{is a good example of}} how events could be improved in the telling." [...] Forsythe points out that Livy noted that in 296 BC the Romans suppressed plebeian disturbances in Lucania <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> the Lucanian aristocracy. He argues that this suggests divisions in Lucania over the alliance with Rome and that, if this was also the case in 298 BC, Barbatus might have gone to Lucania to quell any possible local resistance to the alliance as well as to prevent Samnite raids and to collect the agreed hostages. Forsythe also notes that Barbatus’ campaign in Etruria could be explained in three ways: 1) it could be fictive; 2) Barbatus could have campaigned in both Samnium and Etruria; 3) Barbatus participated in the campaigns linked to the front which led to the Battle of Sentinum in 295 BC, and that this may have included operations in Etruria in that year, but it might have been attributed by later historians to his consulship in 298 BC. As for the claim that Barbatus subdued all of Lucania, Forsythe suggests that this is [...] "perhaps part truth and part a Roman aristocratic exaggeration." ...|$|E

50|$|The Bayanihan version {{attempts}} to blatantly exposit {{the story as}} per Western conventions, and re-tells the Darangen. The dance itself narrates a scene where Putri Gandingan escapes her abductor, the demon king Lawana, and is lost in the forests of Alangka.
