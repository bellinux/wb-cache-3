5|$|The {{biochemical}} {{basis for}} the toxicity of oxygen is the partial reduction of oxygen by one or two electrons to form reactive <b>oxygen</b> <b>species,</b> which are natural by-products of the normal metabolism of oxygen and have important roles in cell signalling. One species produced by the body, the superoxide anion (−), is possibly involved in iron acquisition. Higher than normal concentrations of oxygen lead to increased levels of reactive <b>oxygen</b> <b>species.</b> Oxygen is necessary for cell metabolism, and the blood supplies it to {{all parts of the}} body. When oxygen is breathed at high partial pressures, a hyperoxic condition will rapidly spread, with the most vascularised tissues being most vulnerable. During times of environmental stress, levels of reactive <b>oxygen</b> <b>species</b> can increase dramatically, which can damage cell structures and produce oxidative stress.|$|E

Consistent with these data are our observations that (a) the mitochondrial membrane potential is maximal when uncoupling protein 1 is ablated or inhibited and (b) oxygen consumption rates in mitochondria from uncoupling protein 1 knock-out mice, are significantly lower than those from wild-type mice, but equivalent to those from wild-type mice {{in the presence of}} GDP.

5|$|In rodents and primates, {{sufficiently}} {{high doses}} of amphetamine cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity, or damage to dopamine neurons, which is characterized by dopamine terminal degeneration and reduced transporter and receptor function. There {{is no evidence that}} amphetamine is directly neurotoxic in humans. However, large doses of amphetamine may indirectly cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity as a result of hyperpyrexia, the excessive formation of reactive <b>oxygen</b> <b>species,</b> and increased autoxidation of dopamine. Animal models of neurotoxicity from high-dose amphetamine exposure indicate that the occurrence of hyperpyrexia (i.e., core body temperature≥40°C) is necessary for the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. Prolonged elevations of brain temperature above 40°C likely promote the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity in laboratory animals by facilitating the production of reactive <b>oxygen</b> <b>species,</b> disrupting cellular protein function, and transiently increasing blood–brain barrier permeability.|$|E

Hypothesized links between aging and oxidative stress are not new and were proposed in 1956, which was later refined into the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging. A vicious cycle was thought to occur, as oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial DNA mutations, which can lead to enzymatic abnormalities and further oxidative stress.|$|E

Corresponding amounts of copper salts (30mg/kg) are toxic in animals. A minimum dietary value for healthy growth in rabbits {{has been reported to}} be at least 3 ppm in the diet. However, higher concentrations of copper (100 ppm, 200 ppm, or 500 ppm) in the diet of rabbits may favorably influence feed conversion efficiency, growth rates, and carcass dressing percentages.|$|E

40|$|The role of <b>oxygen</b> {{reactive}} <b>species</b> in granulomatous hypersensitivity was explored using a {{model of}} pulmonary granulomas induced by intravenous injection of eggs from the parasite. Macrophages from sychronously developing lesions spontaneously released significant quantities of superoxide anion (26 nmoles/ 106 / 2 h) by 8 days of development. In contrast, the non-T cell foreign body (Sephadex bead) granuloma macrophages produced only (2 nmoles/ 106 / 2 h) small quantities. Daily administration of the oxygen scavenger, [alpha]-tocopherol, by either oral or parenteral routes caused up to 60 % suppression of granuloma size. Moreover, parenteral administration of specific inactivators of O 2 - and H 2 O 2, superoxide dismutase and catalase respectively, resulted in a 30 to 40 % reduction in granuloma size.

5|$|Often, DVT {{begins in}} the valves of veins. The blood flow pattern in the valves can cause low oxygen {{concentrations}} in the blood (hypoxemia) of a valve sinus. Hypoxemia, which is worsened by venous stasis, activates pathways—ones that include hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1. Hypoxemia also results {{in the production of}} reactive <b>oxygen</b> <b>species,</b> which can activate these pathways, as well as nuclear factor-κB, which regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 transcription. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1 contribute to monocyte association with endothelial proteins, such as P-selectin, prompting monocytes to release tissue factor-filled microvesicles, which presumably begin clotting after binding to the endothelial surface.|$|E

Xanthine oxidase catalyzes the crystallization of uric acid in the joints, a main cause of gouty arthritis, and inhibitors of this enzyme are being used clinically to reduce this side effect. The natural function of these compounds may be to quench reactive <b>oxygen</b> <b>species</b> produced by plants as a defensive response to fungal infection.|$|E

These cells are very rich in xanthine oxidase which may produce <b>oxygen</b> reactive <b>species</b> during ischaemia and reperfusion when a high amount of adenine nucleotides may be catabolized to hypoxanthine.

During hypoxia the adenine nucleotide pool and the energy charge decreased more slowly {{in the presence of}} 0. 5 mM propionyl carnitine than {{in the absence of the}} compound. Furthermore during reoxygenation a more rapid increase of energy charge and adenine nucleotide concentration was observed with propionyl carnitine. These observations suggest that the presence of propionyl carnitine allows the endothelial cells to maintain their functionality and regulatory role on vessel activity for a longer time and decreases the formation of <b>oxygen</b> reactive <b>species</b> due to xanthine oxidase activity on hypoxanthine formed by adenine nucleotide catabolis...|$|R
40|$|Peroxisomes are cell organelles {{that play}} a central role in lipid metabolism. At the same time, these organelles {{generate}} reactive <b>oxygen</b> and nitrogen <b>species</b> as byproducts. Peroxisomes also possess intricate protective mechanisms to counteract oxidative stress and maintain redox balance. An imbalance between peroxisomal reactive <b>oxygen</b> species/reactive nitrogen <b>species</b> production and removal may possibly damage biomolecules, perturb cellular thiol levels, and deregulate cellular signaling pathways implicated in a variety of human diseases. Somewhat surprisingly, the potential role of peroxisomes in cellular redox metabolism has been underestimated for a long time. However, in recent years, peroxisomal reactive <b>oxygen</b> species/reactive nitrogen <b>species</b> metabolism and signaling have become the focus of a rapidly evolving and multidisciplinary research field with great prospects. This review is mainly devoted to discuss evidence supporting the notion that peroxisomal metabolism and oxidative stress are intimately interconnected and associated with age-related diseases. We focus on several key aspects of how peroxisomes contribute to cellular reactive <b>oxygen</b> species/reactive nitrogen <b>species</b> levels in mammalian cells and how these cells cope with peroxisome-derived oxidative stress. We also provide a brief overview of recent strategies that have been successfully employed to detect and modulate the peroxisomal redox status.

The action of one antioxidant may therefore depend on the proper function of other members of the antioxidant system.

However, the United States Department of Agriculture withdrew these ratings in 2012 as biologically invalid, stating that no physiological proof in vivo existed to support the free-radical theory or roles for ingested phytochemicals, especially for polyphenols.

As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH, complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient.|$|E

The hydroxyl radical is particularly unstable and will react rapidly and non-specifically with most biological molecules. This species is produced from hydrogen peroxide in metal-catalyzed redox reactions such as the Fenton reaction. These oxidants can damage cells by starting chemical chain reactions such as lipid peroxidation, or by oxidizing DNA or proteins. Damage to DNA can cause mutations and possibly cancer, if not reversed by DNA repair mechanisms, while damage to proteins causes enzyme inhibition, denaturation and protein degradation.|$|E

In its active state, thioredoxin acts as an efficient reducing agent, scavenging reactive <b>oxygen</b> <b>species</b> and maintaining other proteins in their reduced state. After being oxidized, the active thioredoxin is regenerated by the action of thioredoxin reductase, using NADPH as an electron donor.|$|E
5|$|Ustilago maydis is a {{pathogenic}} plant fungus {{that causes}} smut disease in maize and teosinte. Plants have evolved efficient defense systems against pathogenic microbes such as U. maydis.

U. maydis can respond to the oxidative burst with an oxidative stress response, regulated by the gene YAP1. The response protects U. maydis from the host defense, and is necessary for the pathogen’s virulence. Furthermore, U. maydis has a well-established recombinational DNA repair system which acts during mitosis and meiosis.

Lysis of erythrocytes was evaluated by measuring the turbidity following the decrease in absorbance at 600 nm. The 50 % of erythrocyte lysis of untreated animals was observed after 16 min and in about 30 min all the cells were lysed. With L-propionyl carnitine-treated rat erythrocytes the time at which 50 % of lysis was observed increased to 23 min. L-propionyl carnitine also exerted its protective effect in vitro when incubated with untreated rat erythrocytes or human erythrocytes {{in the presence of the}} cytolytic system. The presence of L-propionyl carnitine in the incubation mixture markedly decreased the malonaldehyde formation. The protection was concentration-dependent. To establish if L-propionyl carnitine protects from <b>oxygen</b> reactive <b>species</b> or is able to stabilize the damaged membranes, a latent damage was produced by incubating the erythrocytes with the cytolytic system for a few minutes. The cells were then removed and suspended in buffered saline in the absence or in the presence of different L-propionyl carnitine concentrations L-propionyl carnitine decreased the velocity of lysis of damaged erythrocytes. These data suggest that L-propionyl carnitine protects erythrocytes from <b>oxygen</b> reactive <b>species</b> and also stabilizes the damaged membrane probably by specific binding with protein and/or phospholipid domains. Low density lipoproteins (LDLs) from human blood were peroxidized by exposure to Cu 2 + ions in the presence of various L-propionyl carnitine concentrations.
