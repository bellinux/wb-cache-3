This was carried out to determine the effect of these factors on vegetation condition affected by the <b>oil</b> <b>spill.</b> Based on regression analysis, it was shown that increase in the volume of <b>oil</b> <b>spill</b> resulted in increased deterioration of vegetation condition (estimated using NDVI and NDWI) in the study site. The study also tested how the length of time gap between the <b>oil</b> <b>spill</b> and image acquisition date influences the detectability of impacts of <b>oil</b> <b>spill</b> on vegetation.

5|$|As waterbirds {{that feed}} on fish, {{pelicans}} are highly susceptible to <b>oil</b> <b>spills,</b> both directly by being oiled {{and by the}} impact on their food resources. A 2007 report to the California Fish and Game Commission estimated that, during the previous 20 years, some 500–1000 brown pelicans had been affected by <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> in California. A 2011 report by the Center for Biological Diversity, {{a year after the}} April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, said that 932 brown pelicans had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that ten times that number had been harmed {{as a result of the}} spill.|$|E

Environmental disasters, such as <b>oil</b> <b>spills,</b> may increase levels of blood haptoglobin and interleukin-6 immunoreactive protein, but decrease body mass. Home ranges of river otters increase in size on oiled areas compared to unoiled areas, and individual otters also modify their habitat use.
