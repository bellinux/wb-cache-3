5|$|Canada has a {{parliamentary}} system {{within the context}} of a constitutional monarchy, the monarchy of Canada being the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The sovereign is Queen Elizabeth II, who is also monarch of 15 other Commonwealth countries and each of Canada's 10 provinces. As such, the Queen's representative, the Governor General of Canada (at present Julie Payette), carries <b>out</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the federal royal duties in Canada.|$|E
5|$|In {{the evening}} of the third day, the U.S. {{launches}} a full-scale assault on Al-Asad's presidential palace, aware of the SAS warning about the possible nuclear device. As U.S. Navy SEALs invade the palace, the Marines engage Al-Asad's ground forces. The assault, however, ends in catastrophe when the nuclear device suddenly detonates, wiping <b>out</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the city along with everyone in it.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian rock pipit's feeding {{habitat is}} rocky coasts, {{rather than the}} damp {{grassland}} favoured by the water pipit. The Eurasian rock pipit feeds mainly on invertebrates, seeking <b>out</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> its prey on foot, only occasionally flying to catch insects. It will venture into shallow water as it follows retreating waves, and may take advantage of human activity that exposes sea slaters or other species that hide under stones.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 4,600 people {{applied to}} be extras {{in the film}} during the open call on January 24, 2009 and January 25, 2009, at Crestwood Court in St. Louis, Missouri. Up in the Air cast 2,000 extras with 15 to 25 Missouri actors in minor {{speaking}} roles. About 250 extras were used from the Omaha, Nebraska, area. They were used for filming {{inside and outside the}} terminal at Eppley Airfield, while Clooney acted <b>out</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his scenes inside the terminal.|$|E
5|$|Chapman sat <b>out</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the {{following}} season due to pregnancy, as Fulham won a treble of FA Women's Premier League National Division, FA Women's Cup and Premier League Cup. She {{made the announcement}} during half-time of a match against Tranmere Rovers, and was promptly substituted by Haugenes – who quipped {{that he was not}} permitted to have 12players on the pitch at once. When Chapman returned to action, in the FA Women's Community Shield in August2003, Fulham were no longer a professional outfit. She represented Fulham in that season's Uefa Women's Cup campaign. In March2004 Chapman played in Fulham's Premier League Cup final defeat to Charlton Athletic.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{beat the}} Chicago Rockets 41–21 at Chicago's Soldier Field {{to extend the}} team's winning streak to four games. The Browns scored a {{touchdown}} {{in the first quarter}} and two more in the second. The team led 27–0 at the half. Chicago, however, started to come back in the third quarter after Cleveland coach Paul Brown took <b>out</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his first-string players. Graham, Colella, Lew Mayne and Ed Ulinski sat <b>out</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the game. Chicago quarterback Sam Vacanti threw three touchdown passes in the second half to give the Rockets 21 points, but a score by Cleveland's Boedeker and a fumble return for a touchdown by Spiro Dellerba kept the game out of reach. The Rockets' Bill Kellagher intercepted one of Graham's passes in the first quarter, ending Graham's streak of 91 straight pass attempts without an interception, a professional football record at the time. Chicago had the best passing performance against the Browns of any team the Browns had faced in 1947 as Vacanti threw for 195 yards on 11 completions. Groza kicked through two field goals and five extra points in the game, putting him in third place in scoring in the AAFC behind Motley and New York's Spec Sanders. Motley suffered a head injury during a pileup in the second quarter and was taken to the locker room.|$|E

5|$|During the French colonial administration, educated Vietnamese were {{employed}} in the civil service administration as secretaries, clerks and bureaucrats. When Cambodia gained independence in 1953, the Sihanouk-led government phased <b>out</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the Vietnamese civil servants with Cambodians, and they sought employment in banks and commercial enterprises as secretaries and other office-based positions. In the 1960s, urban-dwelling Vietnamese with lower education backgrounds also worked as mechanics in car repair and machine shops owned by Chinese businessmen. Vietnamese immigrants that settled in the countryside worked as fishermen along the Tonle Sap lake and Mekong river, and also as rubber plantation workers in Kampong Cham and Kratie provinces.|$|E
5|$|In Delaware, the {{flooding}} damaged numerous houses, including 194 in the Glenville area. The rapid flooding trapped numerous {{people in their}} cars and homes, forcing at least one rescue by helicopter. Those people were evacuated to nearby schools. The severe flooding washed <b>out</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> a bridge in Hockessin and destroyed 6 Wilmington & Western Railroad bridges, causing about $5million (2003USD, $5.5million 2006USD) in damage. The railroad bridges were still being rebuilt as of 2006. Greenbank Mill, a historic gristmill complex, saw $450,000 in damage. Damage in Delaware totaled to $16.1million (2003USD, $17.5million 2006USD).|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} religion, among {{those for whom}} there were data, 71.3% of the {{population}} in 2011 were Romanian Orthodox and 10.6% were Reformed. The Roman Catholic and the Romanian Greek-Catholic communities claimed 5.0% and 4.7% of the population respectively, while other religious groups like Pentecostals (2.7%), Baptists (1.2%), or Unitarians (1.0%) rounded <b>out</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the rest. (Data were unavailable for 7.9% of inhabitants.) By contrast, in 1930, the city was 26.7% Reformed, 22.6% Greek Catholic, 20.1% Roman Catholic, 13.4% Jewish, 11.8% Orthodox, 2.4% Lutheran and 2.1% Unitarian. Contributing factors for these shifts were the extermination and emigration of the city's Jews, the outlawing of the Greek-Catholic Church (1948–89) and the gradual decline in the Hungarian population.|$|E

5|$|Like most US {{diplomatic}} {{posts in}} Africa during the Cold War, a {{primary purpose of}} the embassy was to counter Soviet influence in the region and contain the spread of communism. For a time after the Sino-Soviet split, China was also actively competing for influence in the developing world, including activities in Somalia. Beginning in the 1960s, the US engaged in development projects in Somalia to counter the influence of communism. Staff from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which carried <b>out</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> these projects, comprised a substantial number of the embassy's staff during the next three decades. Educational programs were also given emphasis by the embassy in the years after independence, and there was a sizable Peace Corps presence.|$|E
5|$|The Gestapo's {{transfer}} to Himmler was {{a prelude to}} the Night of the Long Knives, in {{which most of the}} SA leadership were arrested and subsequently executed. The SS and Gestapo carried <b>out</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the killings. On 20 July 1934, Hitler detached the SS from the SA, which was no longer an influential force after the purge. The SS became an independent elite corps of the NSDAP, answerable only to Hitler. Himmler's title of Reichsführer-SS now became his actual rank, equivalent to the rank of field marshal in the army (his previous rank was Obergruppenführer). As Himmler's position and authority grew, so did his de facto rank.|$|E
5|$|The best-known role of {{proteins}} {{in the cell}} is as enzymes, which catalyse chemical reactions. Enzymes are usually highly specific and accelerate only {{one or a few}} chemical reactions. Enzymes carry <b>out</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the reactions involved in metabolism, as well as manipulating DNA in processes such as DNA replication, DNA repair, and transcription. Some enzymes act on other proteins to add or remove chemical groups in a process known as posttranslational modification. About 4,000 reactions are known to be catalysed by enzymes. The rate acceleration conferred by enzymatic catalysis is often enormous—as much as 1017-fold increase in rate over the uncatalysed reaction in the case of orotate decarboxylase (78 million years without the enzyme, 18 milliseconds with the enzyme).|$|E

5|$|The crowd {{moved away}} from the {{immediate}} area of the custom house, but continued to grow in nearby streets. Captain Preston immediately called <b>out</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the 29th Regiment, which adopted defensive positions in front of the state house. Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson was summoned to the scene, and was forced by the movement of the crowd into the council chamber of the state house. From its balcony he was able to minimally restore order, promising there would be a fair inquiry into the shootings if the crowd dispersed.|$|E
5|$|The route {{was once}} part of the Jordan and Skaneateles Plank Road, a plank road {{established}} by a New York State Legislature charter in the 1850s. It spanned {{a short distance from}} Jordan to the village of Skaneateles and was a successor to the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad, which ceased operations in 1834. However, the plank road lasted less than two decades. In 1866, the Legislature granted another charter, this time creating the Skaneateles Railroad and its corporation, which bought <b>out</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the plank road company.|$|E
5|$|The second {{official}} residence for the state's governor {{was built in}} the center of Indianapolis where the Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument now stands. It was designed by Alexander Ralston, who also laid <b>out</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the city. The mansion cost $6,500 and was completed in 1827 during the term of Governor James B. Ray. Ray's wife refused to live in the home because of its lack of privacy; it was never used by a governor. It was inhabited by Indiana Chief Justice Isaac Blackford from around 1830 until the 1850s. It was demolished in the 1870s.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} {{persistent}} rumours of a treasure hidden by Richard II {{somewhere in the}} castle grounds. Richard {{is supposed to have}} hidden part of his personal wealth at Beeston on his journey to Chester in 1399, before boarding a ship to Ireland to suppress a rebellion there. On his return, Richard was deposed by Henry, Duke of Lancaster, the future Henry IV, and his treasure is said to have remained undiscovered. Many searches have been carried <b>out,</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> them focusing on the deep well in the inner bailey, but nothing has ever been found. The rumour of hidden treasure may not be well-founded, as Henry IV is recorded as having recovered Richard's gold and jewellery from its various hiding places.|$|E
5|$|Tudor's {{competitors}} soon {{entered the}} market as well, shipping ice by sea to both Calcutta and Bombay, further increasing demand there and driving <b>out</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the indigenous ice dealers. A grand ice house was built from stone in Calcutta by the local British community to store the ice imports. Small shipments of chilled fruit and dairy products began to be sent out with the ice, achieving high prices. Attempts were made by Italian traders to introduce ice from the Alps into Calcutta, but Tudor repeated his monopolistic techniques from the Caribbean, driving them and many others out of the market. Calcutta remained a particularly profitable market for ice for many years; Tudor alone made more than $220,000 ($4,700,000) in profits between 1833 and 1850.|$|E
5|$|An {{attempt to}} move the 25th Infantry Division's {{division}} trains through the valley became mired in the mud through the night of August 10–11 and was attacked in the morning by North Koreans who had driven American forces from the high ground. In the confusion, North Korean armor was able to penetrate roadblocks and assault the supporting US artillery positions. The surprise attack was successful in wiping <b>out</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the 555th and 90th Field Artillery battalions, with much of their equipment. Both North Korean and American armor swarmed to the scene and US Marines aircraft continued to provide cover, but neither side {{was able to make}} appreciable gains despite inflicting massive numbers of casualties on one another. Upon later inspection, the bodies of 75 men, 55 from the 555th Field Artillery and 20 from the 90th Field Artillery, were found executed when the area again came under American control. Task Force Kean was forced to withdraw back to Masan, unable to hold its gains, and by August 14 it was in approximately the same position it had been in when it started the offensive.|$|E
