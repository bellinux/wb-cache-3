5|$|In 1932–33 the English team, led by Douglas Jardine and jointly {{managed by}} Pelham Warner and Richard Palairet, toured Australia {{and won the}} Ashes in an acrimonious contest that {{became known as the}} Bodyline series. The English team used {{contentious}} bowling tactics where the English pace bowlers Harold Larwood, Bill Voce and Bill Bowes bowled the ball roughly on the line of leg stump. The deliveries were often short-pitched, designed to rise at the batsman's body, with four or five fielders close by on the leg side waiting to catch deflections <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bat.</b> Intended to be intimidating, the tactics proved difficult for batsmen to counter and were physically threatening. The primary target of Bodyline was Donald Bradman, who had overwhelmed the English bowling in the 1930 Ashes series. Leading English cricketers and administrators feared that Bradman would be unstoppable on good Australian batting wickets in 1932–33, and looked for possible weaknesses in his batting technique.|$|E
5|$|In the ballpark's inaugural game on April 17, 2015, the Sounds {{defeated}} the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, 3–2 in 10 innings, {{courtesy of a}} walk-off double hit by Max Muncy that scored Billy Burns from first base. Nashville's Arnold León recorded the first strikeout at First Tennessee Park when Colorado Springs' Matt Long struck out swinging as the leadoff hitter {{at the top of}} the first inning. The park's first hit was a left field single that came in the top of the second inning <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> of Colorado Springs' Matt Clark, who played for the Sounds in 2014. Clark also recorded the stadium's first RBI, slapping a single to center field in the fourth inning that sent Luis Sardiñas across the plate for the park's first run. The first home run in the park's history was hit by Nashville's Joey Wendle four games later on April 21 against the Oklahoma City Dodgers.|$|E

5|$|Making his MLB {{debut on}} May 20, 2007, in an interleague {{game against the}} New York Mets, Clippard {{recorded}} his first MLB win. He pitched six innings, giving up one run <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> of David Wright and three hits. He struck out his first major league batter, José Reyes, on three pitches. He recorded his first career hit in his second at-bat off Mets pitcher Scott Schoeneweis, a double to right center in the sixth inning. Clippard was optioned back to the minor leagues in June. He struggled in {{his return to the}} minor leagues for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, and was demoted to Trenton in July. Though {{he was a member of}} the Trenton team as they won the Eastern League championship, Clippard struggled in the playoffs. The Yankees recalled him in September. Overall with, he had a 3–1 record and a 6.33 ERA with the Yankees.|$|E
5|$|During the {{previous}} winter, England had played Australia in the controversial Bodyline series {{in which the}} English bowlers were accused of bowling {{the ball on the}} line of leg stump. The deliveries were often short-pitched with four or five fielders close by on the leg side waiting to catch deflections <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bat.</b> The tactics were difficult for batsmen to counter and were designed to be intimidatory. In the 1933 English season, Bodyline was a sensitive subject. There had already been controversy in the tourists' match against the MCC, during which Constantine and Manny Martindale, another West Indian fast bowler, were criticised in the press for bowling short. Frustrated by a slow pitch which he believed was intended to neutralise his fast bowlers, Grant had ordered Constantine to bowl Bodyline against Yorkshire, and decided to repeat the tactics in the second Test. The West Indies scored 375, of which Constantine made 31. When England replied, several batsmen were discomfited by the Bodyline bowling; Wally Hammond was struck on the chin and retired hurt. Constantine and Martindale bowled up to four short deliveries each over so that the ball rose to head height; occasionally they bowled around the wicket.|$|E
5|$|Granderson and Daniel Murphy {{were the}} two most {{productive}} hitters in the Mets lineup during their 2015 postseason run to the World Series. While Murphy cooled off in the World Series against the Kansas City Royals, Granderson {{continued to be a}} consistent threat for the Mets out of the leadoff spot and also had three home runs and five RBIs in that World Series. In Game 1, after the Royals tied the game in the ninth inning with a home run off Mets closer Jeurys Familia, Granderson made an excellent leaping catch with nobody out {{in the bottom of the}} 11th inning, <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> of the Royals fastest runner Jarrod Dyson, preventing what would have at least been a lead off triple and likely saving the game at the time, though the Royals would go on to win the game anyway in the bottom of the 14th inning on a sacrifice fly by Eric Hosmer. Throughout the series, playing right field, Granderson played the most consistent and solid defense of any Mets fielder.|$|E

40|$|When {{searching for}} prey, big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) enhance {{the range of}} their sonar by concentrating more energy in the nearly constant-frequency (CF) tail portion of their frequency-modulated (FM) sweeps. We hypothesize that this portion of their signals may be {{vulnerable}} to interference from conspecifics using the same frequencies in their own emissions. To determine how bats modify their signals when confronted with an interfering stimulus, we compared the echolocation calls of bats when a CF jamming tone was on and <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bats</b> performed a two-alternative forced-choice detection task in the laboratory that required the use of echolocation. All three <b>bats</b> shifted <b>the</b> tail-end CF component of their emitted frequency bidirectionally away from the CF jamming stimulus only when the jamming frequency was within 2 – 3 ·kHz of the preferred baseline frequency of <b>the</b> <b>bat.</b> <b>The</b> duration of their emissions did not differ between the jamming and no-jamming trials. The jamming avoidance response of bats may serve to avoid masking or interference in a narrow range of frequencies important for target detection.

25|$|The match {{had already}} had a moment of {{controversy}} earlier. During the Australian innings, Martin Snedden claimed a low outfield catch <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>batting</b> of Greg Chappell when Chappell was on 58. It was ruled not out by the umpires. It was some years before TV replays {{could be used in}} umpiring decisions. Viewers watching replays had divided opinions: some thought it was a clean catch, while others say it passed through the fielder's fingers to touch the grass before coming to rest in his hands. (If modern TV umpiring review had been in use, there was sufficient doubt to rule it not out.) Some commentators believed that Chappell should have taken Snedden's word that the catch was good, as had been a time honoured tradition. Chappell maintained he was not sure about the catch and was within his rights to wait for the umpires to rule. Chappell went on to score 90, before he was caught by Bruce Edgar in similar fashion. This time, Chappell walked after he clearly saw the fielder had cupped his hands under the ball.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the second}} game of the doubleheader, Kansas City {{narrowly}} beat Boston 5-4 in 10 innings to win the weekend series (and sweep the doubleheader), {{as a result of}} Lorenzo Cain walking with two outs and bases loaded in the 10th inning. Even with both wins against the Red Sox on April 21, Boston remained in first place in the AL East as did Kansas City in the AL Central. Dustin Pedroia reached base in all their first 18 games, the most consecutive games to start a season by a Red Sox 2B (breaking the record set by Pete Runnels in 1959). Koji Uehara went 18 1/3 scoreless innings before allowing Billy Butler's homer in the eighth inning of the night game. In his first two at <b>bats</b> on <b>the</b> day game, Jonny Gomes used a <b>bat</b> with <b>the</b> words [...] "Boston Strong" [...] on it as well as the names of the four people killed in the bombings and its aftermath.

5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1895, Bloomingston played second base for the Michigan {{baseball}} team. On May 30, 1895, he led Michigan to an 11-0 win over Cornell at the Detroit Athletic Club field in Detroit. A crowd of 4,000 watched, the Detroit Free Press wrote that [...] "Bloomingston carried <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>batting</b> honors with two homers and a single." [...] Bloomingston's first home run came in the fifth inning and was described by the Free Press as follows:"Bloomingston came to bat with blood in his eye.

In a second the stands and the field were a mass of yellow and blue and 'Bloomy,' as the crowd called him, got a 'football ovation.'"His second home run came in the seventh inning: [...] "The crowd yelled for another home run, and he didn't do a thing but plant the ball over the carriages lined up along the fence in left field." ...|$|R
25|$|A left-handed batsman {{has more}} {{difficulty}} facing off break bowling, because the ball {{moves away from}} his body. This means that any miscalculation can more easily result in an outside edge <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> and a catch going to the wicket-keeper or slips fielders. A ball bowled by a left-arm orthodox spin bowler with an off break action spins in the opposite direction. Such a ball is not normally called an off break, but a left-arm orthodox spinner.|$|E
25|$|Jardine {{called this}} {{modified}} {{form of the}} tactic fast leg theory. On the 1932-33 English tour of Australia, Larwood and Voce bowled fast leg theory at the Australian batsmen.

Wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield's skull was fractured by a ball hitting his head (although the ball had first glanced <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> and Larwood had an orthodox field), almost precipitating a riot by the Australian crowd.|$|E
25|$|If the {{delivered}} ball deflects <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bat,</b> {{and bowls}} the batter, then the informal term {{is known as}} played on, knocked on or dragged on.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the rebound characteristics of wooden baseball bats and aluminum baseball bats. Prior to testing, the point of percussion was determined. <b>The</b> <b>bat</b> being tested was suspended by a string that was attached to a small eye screw placed into the end of the knob of <b>the</b> <b>bat.</b> <b>The</b> string attached to the end of <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> was then secured to a point above an open doorway. <b>The</b> <b>bat</b> was placed into a side-by-side swinging motion from a fixed position.

Three baseballs were dropped on each <b>bat,</b> and <b>the</b> rebound distance was measured by a Locam camera. The velocity of the ball before and after contact was measured. An accelerometer was also used to determine the vibration effects of a baseball hitting a bat from a low elevation (an accelerometer is very delicate).

25|$|The usual {{response}} to a bouncer is for the batsman simply to duck underneath it, but this requires fast reflexes and a strong nerve and the batsman is sometimes hit in any case. The natural reflex is to attempt to defend one's head with a straight bat but this should be suppressed if possible as the likely result {{of this will be}} that the ball flies <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> at an uncontrolled angle making for an easy catch. Most batsman have panicked and lost their wickets in this fashion several times in their career after prolonged spells of bouncers.|$|E
25|$|That {{lead was}} halved {{in the sixth}} through an unearned run. Elliot Biddle got on through an infield hit, and then {{advanced}} to third when Ben Wigmore dropped a fly ball in center field <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> of Hayden Dingle. This allowed Tristan McDonald to drive Wigmore in on a sacrifice fly.

25|$|If a bowler's {{delivery}} {{hits the}} stumps and if {{at least one}} bail is completely removed {{from the top of}} the stumps, the striker (the batsman facing the bowler) is out (assuming the bail does not luckily land back in the stump's spigots).
