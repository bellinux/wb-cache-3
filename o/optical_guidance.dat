5|$|Beryllium mirrors are of {{particular}} interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in <b>optical</b> <b>guidance</b> systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.|$|E

A preliminary evaluation of long-term attitude stability measurements of Pioneer 10 is presented in the Appendix. The major conclusions are: (1) at Saturn flyby, viewing some medium period satellites can provide the best measurement results. (2) At Uranus approach, viewing the planet may give best measurements if early bus-probe separation is required. (3) Final measurement accuracy depends on the data format transmitted to Earth and the applied data interpretation techniques. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} a simple optical {{coupling}} method for water-jet guided laser machining system is introduced and its characteristics are studied. By the introduced method the output spot pattern behind the water-jet was observed {{instead of the}} laser focus. In order to acquire the pattern a piece of glass was used to block the water-jet but let the laser through, and a light screen was placed behind the glass in a certain distance to display the pattern image. Since the image scale could be adjusted by changing {{the distance between the}} glass and the light screen, the CCD magnifying system was no longer needed. It is found that the pattern varied while the coupling condition changed. Only in small chance the pattern was a tiny spot but more commonly it was in a ring-like shape which could be easily recognized.

40|$|In vivo nerve repair {{requires}} {{not only}} the ability to regenerate damaged axons, but most importantly, the ability to guide developing or regenerating axons along paths {{that will result in}} functional connections. Furthermore, basic studies in neuroscience and neuro-electronic interface design require the ability to construct in vitro neural circuitry. Both these applications require the development of a noninvasive, highly effective tool for axonal growth-cone guidance. To date, a myriad of technologies have been introduced based on chemical, electrical, mechanical, and hybrid approaches (such as electro-chemical, optofluidic flow and photo-chemical methods). These methods are either lacking in desired spatial and temporal selectivity or require the introduction of invasive external factors. Within the last fifteen years however, several attractive guidance cues have been developed using purely light based cues to achieve axonal guidance. Here, we report a novel, purely <b>optical</b> repulsive <b>guidance</b> technique that uses low power, near infrared light, and demonstrates the guidance of primary goldfish retinal ganglion cell axons through turns of up to 120 degrees and over distances of ∼ 90 µm...|$|R
