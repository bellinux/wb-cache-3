5|$|A type Ia {{supernova}} (type one-a) {{is a type}} of supernova {{that occurs}} in binary systems (two stars orbiting one another) in which one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> is a white dwarf. The other star can be anything from a giant star to an even smaller white dwarf.|$|E
5000|$|To {{apply this}} method, one must measure <b>the</b> {{apparent}} magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> and know <b>the</b> spectral type <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> <b>The</b> spectral type {{can be determined}} by observing <b>the</b> <b>star's</b> spectrum. If <b>the</b> <b>star</b> lies on <b>the</b> main sequence, as determined by its luminosity class, <b>the</b> spectral type <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> provides a good estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star's</b> absolute magnitude. Knowing the apparent magnitude (m) and absolute magnitude (M) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star,</b> one can calculate the distance (d, in parsecs) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> using [...] (see distance modulus). The true distance to <b>the</b> <b>star</b> may be different than the one calculated due to interstellar extinction.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>star</b> contracts, <b>the</b> {{density and}} {{temperature}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> He II layer increases. He II starts to transform into He III (second ionization). This causes <b>the</b> opacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> to increase {{and the energy}} flux from <b>the</b> interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> is effectively absorbed. <b>The</b> temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> rises and it begins to expand. After expansion, He III begins to recombine into He II and <b>the</b> opacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> drops. This lowers <b>the</b> surface temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> <b>The</b> outer layers contract and the cycle starts from the beginning.|$|R
5000|$|Combined {{with a set}} of {{boundary}} conditions, {{a solution}} of these equations completely describes <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> Typical boundary conditions set <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observable parameters appropriately at the surface (...) and center (...) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star: , meaning the pressure at <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> is zero; , there is no mass inside <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star,</b> as required if the mass density remains , <b>the</b> total mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> is <b>the</b> <b>star's</b> mass; and , <b>the</b> temperature at the surface is <b>the</b> effective temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b>|$|R
5|$|Before {{tools such}} as the {{telescope}} were invented, early study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled, and ideas {{on the nature of}} the Universe began to be explored. Most of early astronomy actually consisted of mapping the positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> and planets, a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.|$|E
5|$|By {{matching}} {{up these}} curves on the HR diagram the absolute magnitude of main-sequence {{stars in the}} cluster can also be determined. This in turn provides a distance estimate to the cluster, based on the visual magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars.</b> The difference between the relative and absolute magnitude, the distance modulus, yields this estimate of the distance.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Vesto Slipher made spectrographic {{studies of}} the {{brightest}} spiral nebulae to determine their composition. Slipher discovered that the spiral nebulae have high Doppler shifts, indicating that they are moving at a rate exceeding the velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> he had measured. He found {{that the majority of}} these nebulae are moving away from us.|$|E
5000|$|For extrasolar planets <b>the</b> {{temperature}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> can {{be calculated}} from <b>the</b> color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> using Planck's law. <b>The</b> calculated temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> {{can be used with}} the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to determine <b>the</b> absolute magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star,</b> which can then be used with observational data to determine the distance to <b>the</b> <b>star</b> and finally <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> Orbital simulations are used to determine what orbital parameters (including orbital distance) produce the observations seen by astronomers. Astronomers use a hypothesized albedo [...] and can then estimate the equilibrium temperature.|$|R
5000|$|Integrating {{the mass}} {{continuity}} equation from <b>the</b> <b>star</b> center (...) to <b>the</b> radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> (...) yields <b>the</b> total mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 499 CE, the Indian {{astronomer}} Aryabhata propounded {{a planetary}} model that explicitly incorporated Earth's rotation about its axis, which he explains {{as the cause}} of what appears to be an apparent westward motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars.</b> He also believed that the orbits of planets are elliptical.|$|E
5|$|In close {{binary star}} systems one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> can lose mass to a heavier companion. Accretion-powered pulsars may drive mass loss. The {{shrinking}} star can then become a planetary-mass object. An {{example is a}} Jupiter-mass object orbiting the pulsar PSR J1719-1438. These shrunken white dwarfs may become a helium planet or carbon planet.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to open clusters, most globular clusters remain gravitationally bound for time periods {{comparable to the}} life spans {{of the majority of}} their stars. However, a possible exception is when strong tidal interactions with other large masses result in the dispersal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|E
