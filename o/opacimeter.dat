40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} ``online'' measurement methods of particle mass concentration of smokes in fire conditions. Three methods were used to measure simultaneously the particle mass concentration of smokes generated in a small compartment. The first method used a microbalance device (TEOM), the second one measured the optical extinction by particles (<b>opacimeter),</b> and the last one was based on the measurement of the current carried by charged particles (PPS). Three tests in the same conditions have been done in order to study the reproducibility of the measured values, which appears to be good. Differences have been observed between the results provided by the three methods caused by the calibration coefficients needed by each device to convert the measured parameter into mass concentration...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is aimed}} at {{investigating}} how the solutions adopted for the SRF (short rotational forestry) {{can be applied to}} oleaginous cultures for bioenergy production with a dual fuel diesel engine. The method is based on four sub-systems: a seed press for oil production, a downdraft gasifier, a biodiesel conversion plant and a dual fuel biodiesel IC engine for CHP (combined heat and power) production. The plant is analytically modeled except for the IC engine that was tested via experimental analysis. Results showed that, in the hypothesis of 8000 hours/year of power plant run, a surface of 27 hectares can supply enough syngas and biodiesel to run a CHP unit with nominal electrical power of 13. 61 kW. Moreover, the experimental analysis outlined how the engine running with dual fuel is not almost affected by significant losses in its performance. Besides, the use of syngas yields strong benefits in terms of soot emissions (measured by an <b>opacimeter),</b> as well as in terms of brake fuel conversion efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Improvement of fuel {{properties}} {{is essential}} for the suppression of diesel pollutant emissions along with the optimization of combustion-related design factors and exhaust after-treatment equipment. Studies conducted in the past have shown that a significant reduction of pollutants using oxygenates as alcohols, ethers, glycol ethers, methylals and carbonates. The present paper experimentally investigates the influence of oxygenated diesel fuels on the emissions with the use of two different synthetic oxygenated compounds namely Diphenyl ether (DPE) and Diet helene glycol dim ethyl ether (DIGLYME). Several diesel fuel blends, which contain 10 % and 15 % by volume of DPE and DIGLYME, were prepared and the effect of these blends on emission characteristics were studied on a twin cylinder direct injection diesel engine. The blends were tested under the different load conditions and the results shows, there is significant reduction of engine emissions of hydrocarbon and carbon mono oxide emissions while the coefficient of light absorption of smoke <b>opacimeter</b> decreases by about 50 % for DPE 10, DIGLYME 10 blend and it was reduced by about 60 %for DPE 15 and DIGLYME 15 blend...|$|E
40|$|Abstract − This {{paper will}} present metrology’s role on air {{pollution}} control in Brazil, the benefits for society and how Inmetro’s Legal Metrology Directorate (Dimel, in its Portuguese acronym) is developing this work. Automotive vehicles are very significant air pollution source in Brazil [1]. To change this situation, two years later the Federal Government established the Automotive Vehicles Air Pollution Control Program (Proconve, in its Portuguese acronym), providing to the car manufacturers a gradual schedule {{to the implementation of}} cleaner automotive technologies on new vehicles. Today the exhaust emissions reduction for these vehicles is up to 97 % [2]. For in-use vehicles, Proconve demanded to all Brazilian states the implementation of an Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) Program. At least once a year these vehicles should be submitted to an I/M authority to check its general conditions and to measure its exhaust emissions. The emissions measurement is performed with two different instruments: gas analyzers (for spark ignition engines) and <b>opacimeters</b> (for Diesel engines). Both instruments are under legal metrological control and are submitted to type evaluation and verification, performed b...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOpacity {{measurements}} {{were carried out}} in a smoke layer using a light source and photodiodes located outside the hot environment, using a network of optical fibers to transport the incident and attenuated light. The whole system was designed with protections for the emission and reception points against smoke, droplets and water vapor generated by a water mist system. It was tested first in laboratory conditions {{in order to assess}} its stability at high temperature or in a water spray. Its accuracy regarding the transmission measurement was then evaluated using a reference material. It was used after these qualifications steps in a fire smoke layer flowing along a corridor ceiling, in order to provide a stratification profile based on transmittance data. Results were compared to the stratification data obtained with classical thermocouple measurements. The analysis showed similar conclusions without spray: the vertical evolution in temperature and transmission indicated a similar smoke-free layer, around 1. 20 m high in the 2. 40 m high corridor when smoke was produced by a 250 kW heptane pool fire in a neighboring room. When studying smoke/mist interactions using a nozzle injecting water in the corridor, a perfect mixing was deduced from temperature measurements, while some discrepancies still appeared with the <b>opacimeters,</b> indicating some variations in the particle concentrations. The opacity could serve to predict these concentration profiles and the visibility in the smoke/droplet medium...|$|R
40|$|The European Metrology Research Programme {{participating}} {{countries and the}} European Union jointly fund a three year project to address the need of the automotive industry for a metrological sound base for exhaust measurements. The collaborative work on particle emissions involves five European National Metrology Institutes, the Tampere University of Technology, the Joint Research Centre for Energy and Transport and the Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research. On one hand, a particle number and size standard for soot particles is aimed for. Eventually this will allow the partners to provide accurate and comparable calibrations of measurement instruments for the type approval of Euro 5 b and Euro 6 vehicles. Calibration aerosols of combustion particles, silver and graphite proof partially suitable. Yet, a consensus choice together with instrument manufactures is pending as the aerosol choice considerably affects the number concentration measurement. Furthermore, the consortium issued consistent requirements for novel measuring instruments foreseen to replace today’s <b>opacimeters</b> in regulatory periodic emission controls of soot and compared them with European legislative requirements. Four partners are conducting a metrological validation of prototype measurement instruments. The novel instruments base on light scattering, electrical, ionisation chamber and diffusion charging sensors and will be tested at low and high particle concentrations. Results shall allow manufacturers to further improve their instruments to comply with legal requirements...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{discusses}} the experimental investigations on the flame induced by fuel film deposition ignition {{in a single}} cylinder, ported fuel injection, four-stroke, over-boosted spark-ignition engine with a four-valve production head. The engine was optically accessible and equipped with a transparent quartz window {{in the bottom of}} the combustion chamber. 2 D-digital imaging and UV-visible natural emission spectroscopy were used to follow the flame propagation in the combustion chamber. Two colour pyrometers were applied to evaluate flame temperature and soot concentration. Particulate matter and soot primary particles diameters were measured and correlated with the soot amount produced in the combustion chamber. The effect of the intake air pressure and injection phasing was investigated. Optical setup for spectroscopic measurements and visible digital imaging, visible flame emission detected in the chamber for the selected operating conditions, visible emission spectra measured at 60 CAD ASOS in the chamber, soot concentration measured at the selected operating conditions, integral soot concentration measured at the selected operating conditions, particulate mass concentration measured by the <b>Opacimeter</b> and particles number concentration measured by LII at the engine exhaust are presented in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Several {{fundamental}} questions are discussed relating to show through of ink on paper. These questions relate to (a) {{the significance of}} ink and press variables in regard to show through; (bj {{the correlation between the}} light reflectivity of an ink film thickness and the show through of the ink; (c) the correlation between the percentage of pigment in the ink, and the show through of ink; (d) the interchangeability of various instruments for the measurement of show through. Data is obtained using a standard offset ink in combination with several different kinds of paper. Several, different known ink film thicknesses are tested as well as various pigment concentrations. Samples are tested on the IGT printability tester. Using an <b>opacimeter,</b> a reflection densitometer, and a spectrophotometer, the show through for each printed sample is determined In terms of the opacity of the paper used, the reflection density of the ink film, and the reflective spectrum of the ink film. Correlation between the variables in the research is established. The resulting data is analysed using various statistical techniques. It is concluded from the resulting data and analysis that there are several variables that will contribute to show through. A change in pigment concentration or ink film thickness will result in a change in the show through of a particular ink on a particular paper. There is a correlation between the weight and type of paper and the show through of ink on those papers. Some instruments are adequate for determining show through, while others are not. It is recommended that reflection density of an ink film be used as a simple indication of show through. Problems regarding accuracy of instrumentation are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractStatistics {{reveal that}} people mostly die in {{bedrooms}} or lounges, from smoking-related fires. However, at present, {{little is known}} of this phenomenon, {{especially in terms of}} identifying which fire effects first injure people. Through several real-scale fire tests, two different sets of fire scenarios are explored in a single bedroom apartment. As in everyday life, the test room is equipped with furniture, clothes and items supplied from major retailers. It is heavily instrumented with sensors to record tenability-related data (thermocouples, heat fluxmeters, gas analyzer including 3 FTIRs, <b>opacimeters</b> and several cameras for video recording). The first set of tests explores a bed fire scenario, in which a person has fallen asleep, accidentally lighting its quilt, and then its mattress, e. g. with a cigarette or a small flame. The door and window remain closed during the entire test, and the fire decreases rapidly to become insignificant {{because of a lack of}} oxygen. The second set of tests explores a wastepaper basket fire scenario, with a first person leaving the room quickly, while a second person – who is potentially disabled – cannot leave the room. As the door remains open, there is enough oxygen supply, and the fire grows to flashover. The test results are designated as reference for calculation models validation. In addition, their interpretation in terms of tenability is presented; fire effects are classified and discussed. All this work also highlights the importance of smoke alarms in such premises...|$|R
