Fitzgerald's revisions included an extensive rewriting of Chapter VI and VIII. Despite this, he refused an offer of $10,000 for the serial rights in <b>order</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> delay the book's publication. He had received a $3,939 advance in 1923 and $1,981.25 upon publication.|$|E
5|$|In the afternoon, {{there was}} {{fighting}} both west (Hill's Corps renewing their {{attacks on the}} I Corps) and north (Ewell's Corps attacking the I and XI Corps) of Gettysburg. Ewell, on Oak Hill with Rodes, saw Howard's troops deploying before him, and he interpreted this as the start of an attack and implicit permission to set aside Gen. Lee's <b>order</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> bring about a general engagement.|$|E
5|$|Kastner's {{reasons for}} not making the {{document}} public are unknown. Vrba believed {{until the end of}} his life that Kastner withheld it in <b>order</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> jeopardize negotiations between the Aid and Rescue Committee and Adolf Eichmann, the SS officer in charge of the transport of Jews out of Hungary. Shortly after Vrba arrived in Slovakia from Auschwitz in April 1944, Eichmann proposed to the Aid and Rescue Committee in Budapest (specifically to Kastner, Joel Brand and Hansi Brand) that the Nazis trade up to one million Hungarian Jews for 10,000 trucks and other goods from the Western Allies. The proposal came to nothing, but in exchange for money and other goods Kastner did obtain safe passage to Switzerland for 1,684 Jews on what became known as the Kastner train. Vrba believed that Kastner suppressed the Vrba–Wetzler report in <b>order</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> damage those negotiations with the SS.|$|E

5|$|After {{his band}} The Crosswalk was dropped from Hollywood Records in 1997, Cody Chesnutt spent several months {{recording}} The Headphone Masterpiece in his bedroom, {{which he used}} as a makeshift studio called the Sonic Promiseland, in Valley Village, California. He used a 4-track recorder, and recorded the songs entirely by himself with equipment worth $10,000, including one microphone, an organ, a guitar, bass, and keyboard. He used a pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones as a studio monitor in <b>order</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> wake up his roommate. It was subsequently mastered by Brian Gardner.|$|E
5|$|Defying a doctor's <b>order</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{work for}} two weeks due to high blood pressure, Laffoon presided for three days as a special judge in the Union County Circuit Court in February 1941. On February 17, 1941, he {{returned}} home early from his law office due to a bout of dizziness. It was {{reported that he had}} suffered a stroke, and after a mild improvement, his condition worsened again and he died on March 1, 1941, at 2:50am. He was buried in Grapevine Cemetery in Madisonville.|$|E
5|$|In 1190, 150 local Jews {{were killed}} in a pogrom in the castle keep, most of them {{committed}} suicide in <b>order</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> fall to the hands of the mob. Henry III rebuilt the castle in stone {{in the middle of the}} 13th century, creating a keep with a unique quatrefoil design, supported by an outer bailey wall and a substantial gatehouse. During the Scottish wars between 1298 and 1338, York Castle was frequently used as the centre of royal administration across England, as well as an important military base of operations.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, PSA {{decided that}} their new small Talbot {{would also be}} based on the 104 rather than the Horizon. Keeping the common {{underpinnings}} allowed the new model, known internally as project C15 (later renamed to T15 to reflect the brand change from Chrysler to Talbot) to be launched in 1981, in time to replace the Sunbeam when Linwood would close. In <b>order</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> create too much internal competition, a wheelbase between the 3 door and 5 door versions of the 104 was chosen. This made the projected model slot in size slightly below popular superminis such as the Ford Fiesta, but above the city cars, including the about-to-be-launched Austin Metro.|$|E
5|$|The Aid and Rescue Committee's {{first meeting}} with Eichmann was on 25 April 1944. At {{around the same time}} Kastner is {{believed}} to have received a copy of the Vrba–Wetzler report, possibly in German. Vrba alleged that Kastner failed to distribute the report in <b>order</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> jeopardize the Eichmann deal, but acted on it privately by arranging for 1,684 Hungarian Jews to escape to Switzerland on the Kastner train, which left Budapest on 30 June 1944.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{churches in}} the city centre, the Ascension and St Dimitri churches, {{were built in the}} 18th century, after the 1689 Great Fire. They were both renovated in the 19th century. The Church of the Ascension is {{particularly}} small it is half-buried in <b>order</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> overlook neighbouring mosques. In the 19th century, several new churches were built, including the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, which is a large three-nave building designed by Andrey Damyanov.|$|E

5|$|After {{several members}} of the {{resistance}} are killed by the Gestapo, Winther suspects they have an informant among them. Later, Bent visits Ketty's hotel room, and they have sex. Meanwhile, Jørgen visits his wife and advises her boyfriend to treat her properly or he will return. In a meeting, Winther says the informer is Ketty and orders her death. Bent meets Ketty; she tells him she works for both Winther and army intelligence, and that Winther does not work for the British. Winther, involved with Gilbert and Seibold, had ordered them to be killed in <b>order</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be seen as a traitor. Bent and Jørgen search for Winther in the bar and discover that he has escaped to Stockholm. They realize it is a trap, and they escape from the Gestapo men. They decide to kill Karl Heinz Hoffmann, the Gestapo's leader, and then take over the favorite Gestapo restaurant. Bent cannot kill Hoffmann because they have to get away when he notices the police coming. That night, Ketty says to Bent that he and Jørgen should go to Stockholm. In the meeting, they are offered positions in the Danish Army but they refuse. A man called Ravnen gives them the name of the real informer, and Jørgen soon kills him.|$|E
5|$|By 1310 the {{relationship}} between Edward II and his earls had deteriorated {{to the point where}} a committee of earls took control of government from the king. The earls disobeyed a royal <b>order</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> carry arms to parliament, and in full military attire presented a demand to the king for the appointment of a commission of reform. At the heart of the deteriorating situation was the peers' opinion of Edward II's relationship with Piers Gaveston, and his reputedly outrageous behavior. On 16 March 1310, the king agreed to the appointment of Ordainers, who were {{to be in charge of}} the reform of the royal household. John of Brittany was one of eight earls appointed to this committee of21, referred to as the Lords Ordainers. He was among the Ordainers considered loyal to Edward II and was also by this time one of the older remaining earls.|$|E
5|$|Jane's legal husband, who {{was still}} living in London, {{attempted}} to blackmail her in 1838 by publishing {{the details of her}} marital status in Barnard Gregory's The Satirist. Johnson published the notice after learning that she was living with a Mr. Hogg. He was mistaken as to the identity of her lover, however, and attempted to blackmail James Hogg, a Member of Parliament for Beverly. After James Hogg prepared to bring a libel suit, Johnson quickly disappeared. Although one journalist initially planned to publish the correct identities of the parties involved, at Mary Shelley's request Leigh Hunt convinced him not to publish the story. Johnson died in Hammersmith in 1840, ensuring an end to the matter. Though they were now free to marry, Jane and Thomas declined to marry in <b>order</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> draw {{attention to the fact that}} they had been unmarried for so long.|$|E

5|$|Pelicans {{are very}} large birds with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook {{at the end}} of the upper mandible, and the {{attachment}} of a huge gular pouch to the lower. The slender rami of the lower bill and the flexible tongue muscles form the pouch into a basket for catching fish and, sometimes, rainwater, though in <b>order</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hinder the swallowing of large fish, the tongue itself is tiny. They have a long neck and short stout legs with large, fully webbed feet. Although they are among the heaviest of flying birds, they are relatively light for their apparent bulk because of air pockets in the skeleton and beneath the skin enabling them to float high in the water. The tail is short and square. The wings are long and broad, suitably shaped for soaring and gliding flight, and have the unusually large number of 30 to 35 secondary flight feathers.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{that the}} {{artillery}} would not break the Polish, General von Toll devised {{a new plan}} of attack. He decided to disregard Paskevich's <b>order</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> assault Warsaw. Although dusk was nearing, von Toll ordered an all-out assault on both the western and southern fronts. As {{there was no time}} for proper artillery preparation, von Toll wanted to overwhelm the defenders by sheer numerical superiority, even if it meant increased casualties from Polish artillery. To distract the Polish artillery at Czyste and prevent it from firing at the Russian columns attacking Forts 21 and 22, Muraviev's forces were to lead the attack directly towards the Jerozolimskie Gate. Before 15:00, von Toll dispatched General Neidhardt to Paskevich to receive his blessing for the new plan, but Paskevich categorically refused, and ordered his subordinate to continue shelling the Polish forts with artillery at least until 16:00. As the Russian commander-in-chief was away, von Toll decided to act despite Paskevich's orders.|$|E
5|$|This failure {{prompted}} the German command to rethink its strategy. To reinforce {{the troops and}} replace the losses, additional personnel were transferred from the 163rd Infantry Division based in Southern Finland. With a combined effort by all the German forces, extensive air-support by Luftflotte 5, {{as well as a}} supportive flanking attack by the Finnish 6th Division, they finally broke through the Soviet defenses on 6 July and captured Salla. A heavy Soviet counterattack drove them back out of the town but on 8 July, a general Soviet retreat of the 122nd Rifle Division allowed the German forces to recapture the town. The Soviet troops had to leave most of their artillery behind and in the heavy fighting some 50 Soviet tanks were destroyed. In <b>order</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> lose momentum, the SS Division Nord pursued the 122nd Rifle Division toward Lampela, while the 169th Division turned east toward Kayraly. Meanwhile, the Finnish 6th Division was making good progress in its flanking manoeuvre to the east to circumvent Kayraly and Lape Apa.|$|E

5|$|During {{the last}} weeks {{of the year in}} Albania, there was no {{fighting}} since the Ottomans did not normally engage in battle during the winter. But Krujë was still under siege and Ottoman garrisons in other areas remained. Life became harder for the population after the destruction of crops and villages and the masses of refugees. By November 22, news came to Venice about the campaigns of Sinan bey against Albania Veneta in order to pressure the Republic to accept a peace or a ceasefire. The Signoria was slow {{to come to terms with}} Mehmed due to the pressure put on it by Pope Paul, Hungary, and Naples to remain at war. The attempt to sway the Venetians failed and the campaign was cancelled. This had an adverse effect for the Ottomans since Lekë Dukagjini, Skanderbeg's ally in northern Albania, decided to work without reservation with Skanderbeg against the Ottomans. In Rome, the pope continued to hold Skanderbeg and would only give him 300 ducats to support his stay. On Christmas Eve, Paul invited Skanderbeg to a ceremony where he was awarded with a sword and helmet and referred to him as Alexander, king of the Epirotes. By 7 January 1467, a consistory convened where Skanderbeg and the pope were present. According to Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga, the pope's appeal to fund Skanderbeg with only 5,000 ducats was heard and when the Cardinals responded that the fund was minimal, Paul explained that he would send more once Italy was pacified. Paul's decision led to a fierce debate on Italy's future which left Albania's fate undiscussed. A second consistory was called on 12 January but did not result in anything favorable for Skanderbeg. Contemporaries were critical of the pope's delays but he explained that he was waiting to see what Ferdinand of Naples was willing to offer before offering anything himself, in <b>order</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> waste funds.|$|E
5|$|Food {{preservation}} methods were {{basically the same}} as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of canning in the early 19th century. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture, thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent microorganisms that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of stockfish), or in warm ovens, cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters. Subjecting food {{to a number of}} chemical processes such as smoking, salting, brining, conserving or fermenting also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. Butter tended to be heavily salted (5–10%) in <b>order</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> spoil. Vegetables, eggs or fish were also often pickled in tightly packed jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, verjuice or vinegar). Another method was to seal the food by cooking it in sugar or honey or fat, in which it was then stored. Microbial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains, fruit and grapes were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens, and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or buttermilk.|$|E
