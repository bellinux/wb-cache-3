40|$|Productivity {{improvement}} {{has become}} an important almost in all mass manufacturing industries, who really implement various methods in the manufacturing process. Productivity improvement techniques can be applied effectively in enterprises of any size, from <b>one-person</b> <b>companies</b> to corporations with thousands of staff. The majority of the techniques were first seen in mass – production operations but the benefits they can yield in SME {{are not to be}} underestimated. Indeed, the absence in SME of many of the rigidities commonly found in large companies make it easier for them to reap the benefits of productivity improvement techniques. Lean thinking and enterprise resource planning systems, it zooms in on productivity improvement techniques. Productivity also applies to service sector and many organizations of these sectors are also implementing various methods to improve their productivity. Manufacturing is becoming the provision of complete service over the whole product life cycle. This new service provision requires manufacturers to get closer to their customer and to operate far more responsively than past.

40|$|Not {{until the}} rise of the {{corporation}} {{at the turn of the}} 20 th century, did wage employment take precedence over personal enterprise in the United States. Today, a new economic shift is bringing more and more people back into business ownership. Currently, 20 million business owners operate <b>one-person</b> <b>companies.</b> Annually, almost 700, 000 new businesses are started in the U. S. In 2004, the Small Business Administration reported that 12. 2 percent of the general population chose self-employment. In contrast, a slightly higher number or 14. 3 percent of people with disabilities started businesses (SBA, 2004). Since self-employment is beginning to be a vocational option that individuals with disabilities are selecting, START-UP / USA staff talked with several entrepreneurs to learn about their experiences. Their businesses represent enterprises as diverse as web-based sporting goods sales, horse riding instruction and boarding, wildlife photography, specialty pet treats, and computer and peripheral repair. These successful entrepreneurs are located in both rural and urban environments. Each individual was asked the same set of questions that appear in this fact sheet. Their answers provide insights, encouragement, and cautions for other individuals with disabilities who might want to consider business ownership.

5000|$|In India, {{there are}} three types of limited company: a public limited company, a private limited company, and a <b>one-person</b> <b>company.</b> A company's {{liability}} may be limited by shares, {{in which case the}} liability of the company's members is limited to the amount of the shares held by them, or it may be limited by guarantee, in which case the liability is limited to a predetermined amount the company's members have agreed to contribute if the company is dissolved with outstanding liabilities. A private limited company is a limited company incorporated under the Companies Act 2013 (or one of its predecessor acts), with a minimum paid-up share capital (if any) of , with an article that restricts the transfer of its shares; it may have between two and two hundred members, and its name ends with [...] "Private Limited" [...] (abbreviated Pvt Ltd).

40|$|A Director in Limited {{liability}} company The {{main reason}} {{of my research}} is a position of a director in Limited liability company. In my opinion this topic is very timely. Firstly due to the upcoming recodification of private law and secondly due {{to the position of}} a director as a statutory body of this kind of company which is our most common legal form of the capital company. The aim of the thesis is to describe a legal status of a director and to emphase the most important aspects of his function. The thesis also highlights the pitfalls of interpretation of certain provisions. The thesis is composed of 6 main chapters Chapter One briefly explains the definition of a director and the position of a director as a statutory body. There are defined requirements needed to perform the function of a director. Chapter Two compares the function of a director when a new company is formed and on contrary the emergence of this position during the existence of a company. Chapter Three deals with various ways of cessation of the function of a director. The greatest attention is paid to the resignation, in particular to the resignation in <b>one-person</b> <b>company</b> with one director. Chapter Four is concerned with the action of a director. The first part of this chapter is devoted to the two most important components of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Capstone project courses {{have become}} an {{increasingly}} important part of Engineering Technology programs. These hands on projects {{can be useful in}} improving student outcomes and generating assessment data for accreditation. Administering capstone project coursework can be challenging for faculty. Depending on the number of students in the program finding projects with the appropriate technical scope can be problematic. Obtaining materials and funding can also be a substantial obstacle, particularly for undergraduate work. One approach to administering Capstone projects that is gaining popularity is for faculty and students to partner with industry to connect students with real world engineering problems. This kind of academia/corporate collaboration has its own set of challenges. Depending on the company and the project, there will be various kinds of risk assumed by the involved parties. Students are typically focused on meeting program requirements and graduation. Faculty may be looking to support scholarship, perform curricular assessments, and to maintain future collaborations. Companies are usually focused on resource allocation, time to market, and cost. This work describes an Engineering Technology Capstone project that took place over a two-year period with a team of five undergraduate students, two faculty members and a corporate mentor. The industry sponsor was a small <b>one-person</b> <b>company</b> that specializes in the design and assembly of mechanical and electrical sensing systems. Several state and federal programs provided funding for materials and student compensation. The goal was to develop a solar powered remote network of sensors that could be installed on a building’s roof. The purpose of this network is to measure the characteristics of the roof’s snow load. For the experimental installation, mobile applications were developed to monitor the network’s data stream and issue warnings of possible hazardous structural conditions. The original prototype used open-source programmable microcontrollers that supported wireless communication and global positioning systems (GPS). The resulting systems were evaluated and tested. Several follow on revisions were developed to optimize the power budget and casing into a commercial product that could be manufactured at a competitive price point. The project provided students a significant technical challenge, was funded, supported faculty scholarship, and helped a small company successfully launch a new commercial product...|$|E
