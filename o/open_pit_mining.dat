5|$|Most {{exploitation}} of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere, after {{which one can}} burn the shale directly to generate electricity, or undertake further processing. The most common methods of surface mining involve <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> <b>mining</b> and strip mining. These procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. Underground mining of oil shale, which removes less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar method.|$|E
25|$|In <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> <b>mining,</b> {{overburden}} {{is removed}} by drilling and blasting {{to expose the}} ore body, which is then mined by blasting and excavation using loaders and dump trucks. Workers spend much time in enclosed cabins thus limiting exposure to radiation. Water is extensively used to suppress airborne dust levels.|$|E

However, {{the total amount}} of ore that could be mined in <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> <b>mining</b> here was small {{compared}} to Kiirunavaara, and LKAB preferred to concentrate resources in one place. Nevertheless, mining here continued until 1974 and later it became a research mine.|$|E

25|$|The Williamson diamond mine {{is a large}} {{open pit}} mine {{currently}} about 90 meters (300ft) deep. Diamond mining operations at the Williamson diamond mine are composed of four distinct activities: mining of the pit, re-treatment of tailings to recover missed diamonds, and gravel mining both on the property and adjacent to the property where gravel has been alluvially deposited. The <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> <b>mining</b> and tailings re-treatment are {{the largest of the}} four operations. The mine employs about 1,100 staff, mostly Tanzanians.|$|E

Initially the mine will process 70,000 tonnes of rock per day, ramping up to 85,000 tonnes {{from both the}} open pit and the underground mine (underground mining {{is to be done}} by block caving). The yield from the first phase of mining will be ground through one semi-autogenous grinding mill (SAG mill). Expansion to new underground areas will result in an additional increase of up to 140,000 tonnes per day with a possible increase to 170,000 tonnes per day.|$|E

500|$|Around {{the year}} 1887 at Bingham Canyon in the Oquirrh Mountains, low-grade copper {{deposits}} were discovered and mining claims were filed. [...] Bingham Canyon is a porphyry copper deposit where magma containing copper, molybdenum, gold and other minerals slowly moved {{its way to}} the surface and cooled into rock. [...] By 1890, underground copper mining had started, and in 1907, Kennecott Copper Mine started <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> <b>mining.</b> [...] In the early 20th century, mills were established near the Jordan River in Midvale and West Jordan to process ore. As of 2010, Kennecott Copper Mine's open pit is [...] wide and [...] deep.|$|E
500|$|Oil shale is mined {{either by}} {{traditional}} underground mining or surface mining techniques. There are several mining methods available, but the common aim {{of all these}} methods is to fragment the oil shale deposits in order to enable the transport of shale fragments to a power plant or retorting facility. The main methods of surface mining are <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> <b>mining</b> and strip mining. An important method of sub-surface mining is the room-and-pillar method. In this method, the material is extracted across a horizontal plane while leaving [...] "pillars" [...] of untouched material to support the roof. These pillars {{reduce the likelihood of}} a collapse. Oil shale can also be obtained as a by-product of coal mining.|$|E
500|$|The {{construction}} of Shasta Dam and its afterbay (regulating downstream dam), Keswick Dam, in 1943 and 1950, respectively, severely impaired {{the capability of}} the Sacramento River to flush away pollutants from the mine. Acid mine drainage flowed, unfettered, down Spring Creek directly into the Keswick Reservoir, depositing contaminated sediment and turning {{a portion of the}} water a rusty red shade. Previously, the water would have continued down the creek into the river, and flushed to the Pacific Ocean. The pooling of the water, however, made it extremely difficult for the pollutants to be removed. From 1955 to 1962, <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> <b>mining</b> began on the site. At its peak, the mine discharged 5 tons of iron, [...] of copper, and [...] of zinc into the stream per day. By then, the water flowing down the drainage was so contaminated that it necessitated the {{construction of}} a holding dam, the Spring Creek Dam.|$|E

2500|$|Approximately 20% of Alberta's {{oil sands}} are {{recoverable}} through open-pit mining, while 80% require in situ extraction technologies (largely {{because of their}} depth).

Approximately 0.19% of the Alberta boreal forest has been disturbed by <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> <b>mining.</b> The Alberta government requires companies to restore the land to [...] "equivalent land capability".

Later, {{at the height of the}} Minong operation, some 150 miners were employed at the mine. A railroad ran between the mine proper and Cove, and the mining settlement had a post office, a dam, a stamp mill (built in 1876), a dock, and a blacksmith's shop.|$|E

2500|$|By 2009, the two {{extraction}} {{methods used}} were in situ extraction, when the bitumen occurs deeper within the ground, (which {{will account for}} 80 percent of oil sands development) and surface or open-pit mining, when the bitumen {{is closer to the}} surface. Only 20 percent of bitumen can be extracted using <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> <b>mining</b> methods, which involves large scale excavation of the land with huge hydraulic power shovels and 400-ton heavy hauler trucks. Surface mining leaves toxic tailings ponds. In contrast, in situ uses more specialized techniques such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). [...] "Eighty percent of the oil sands will be developed in situ which accounts for 97.5 percent of the total surface area of the oil sands region in Alberta." [...] In 2006 the Athabasca deposit was the only large oil sands reservoir in the world which was suitable for large-scale surface mining, although most of this reservoir can only be produced using more recently developed in-situ technology.|$|E
