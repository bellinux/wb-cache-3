50|$|Transparency in an {{organization}} allows unraveling and even quantifying sources of uncertainty. It is an <b>objective</b> <b>estimation</b> of the company’s manufacturing capability and readiness. Most manufacturing strategies (such as mass production, lean manufacturing, flexible manufacturing, and reconfigurable manufacturing) haphazardly assume continuous equipment availability and constant maximum performance, which may never occur in a real factory. Manufacturing machines, like any other mechanical engineering assets, are prone to wear and tear that inhibit uninterrupted uptime. In order to achieve transparence within a facility, manufacturing industry is then asked to metamorphose into predictive manufacturing system so that data can be systematically processed into information that can explain the uncertainties and thereby enable users of the manufacturing assets to make more informed and evidence-based decisions.|$|E

40|$|This study {{reports on}} {{experiments}} that examine anchoring in single referendum questions in contingent valuation surveys on {{willingness to pay}} for public goods, and on <b>objective</b> <b>estimation.</b> Strong anchoring effects are found that lead to systematically higher estimated mean responses from Yes/No referendum responses than from open-ended responses. This response pattern is similar for contingent valuation questions and for <b>objective</b> <b>estimation</b> questions. The paper concludes that psychometric anchoring effects, rather than incentive effects, are the likely cause of results commonly found in contingent valuation studies, and that the currently popular single referendum elicitation format is highly vulnerable to anchoring. ...|$|E

It is useful for many investors to satisfy simultaneously the three investment <b>objectives,</b> <b>estimation</b> sensitivity, asymmetric risks appreciation and portfolio stability. A typical investor with such objectives is a sovereign wealth fund (SWF). We use China’s SWF as an example to empirically test the method based on a 15 -asset strategic asset allocation problem.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of software inspection is to detect faults within a software artifact. This helps {{to reduce the}} number of faults and to increase the quality of a software product. However, although inspections have been performed with great success, and although the quality of the product is increased, it is difficult to estimate the quality. During the inspection process, attempts with <b>objective</b> <b>estimations</b> as well as with subjective estimations have been made. These methods estimate the fault content after an inspection and give a hint of the quality of the product. This paper describes an experiment conducted throughout the inspection process, where the purpose is to compare the estimation methods at different points. The experiment evaluates team estimates from subjective and <b>objective</b> fault content <b>estimation</b> methods integrated with the software inspection process. The experiment was conducted at two different universities with 82 reviewers. The result shows that objective estimates outperform subjective when point and confidence intervals are used. This contradicts the previous studies in the are...|$|R

Modern imaging technology (ultrasound and /or magnetic resonance imaging) could provide <b>objective</b> <b>estimations</b> of uterine anatomy {{for the needs}} of differential diagnosis among the six groups. However, infrequent anomalies, subtle changes or combined pathologies could not be allocated correctly to one of the six groups. A sixth class was created for these cases {{in order to keep the}} other groups “clear”. Furthermore, the system is designed to include, hopefully, all cases resulting from formation, fusion or absorption defects of normal embryological development. Duplication defects or ectopic Müllerian tissue anomalies, if existing, could not be described; these anomalies could be put in this class.|$|R
40|$|Various {{approaches}} {{have been reported}} on HRIR modeling to lighten the high computation cost of the 3 -D audio systems without sacrificing {{the quality of the}} rendered sounds. The performance of these HRIR models have been widely evaluated usually in terms of the <b>objective</b> <b>estimation</b> errors between the original measured HRIRs and the modeled HRIRs. However, it is still unclear how much these objective evaluation results match the psychoacoustic evaluations. In this research, an efficient finite-impulse-response (FIR) model is studied as a case study which is essentially based on the concept of the minimum-phase modeling technique. The accuracy dependency of this modeling approach on the order of FIR filter is examined with the <b>objective</b> <b>estimation</b> errors and the psychoacoustic tests. In the psychoacoustic tests, the MIT HRIR database are exploited and evaluated in terms of sound source localization difference and sound quality difference by comparing the synthesized stimuli with the measured HRIRs and those with the FIR models of different orders. Results indicated that the measured hundred-sample-length HRIRs can be sufficiently modeled by the low-order FIR model from the perceptual point of view, and provided the relationship between perceptual sound localization/quality difference and the <b>objective</b> <b>estimation</b> results that should be useful for evaluating the other HRIR modeling approaches...|$|E

40|$|Rapid, {{reliable}} and <b>objective</b> <b>estimations</b> of {{leaf area index}} (LAI) are essential for numerous studies of atmosphere-vegetation interaction, as LAI is very often a critical parameter in process-based models of vegetation canopy response to global environmental change. This paper reviews current knowledge concerning the use of direct and indirect methods for LAI determination. The value of optical LAI measurements by means of hemispherical photography has already been demonstrated in previous studies. As clumping {{seems to be the}} main factor causing errors in indirect LAI estimation, we suggest that the use of a digital camera with high dynamic range has the potential to overcome a number of described technical problems related to indirect LAI estimation. Further testing and defining of a standardised field protocol for digital hemispherical photography is however needed to improve this technique to achieve the standards of an ideal device.

The aims {{of this study}} were to evaluate (1) the new creatinine-based formula recently proposed by Schwartz using a kinetic colorimetric compensated Jaffe technique; (2) some cystatin C-derived formulas (Hoek, Le Bricon, Larsson, Rule, Filler, and Zappitelli) using a nephelemetric technique; and (3) combined formulas using both cystatin and creatinine (Zappitelli and Bouvet). Design, setting, participants, & measurements These formulas were evaluated in a cross-sectional cohort of 252 children with moderate CKD or normal GFR, in comparison with the reference standard (inulin clear-ance, iGFR). Mean age, body weight, height, creatinine, and cystatin C were 10. 7 4. 0 years, 35 15 kg, 137 20 cm, 55 30 mol/L, and 0. 91 0. 35 mg/L, respectively. Results Mean SD iGFR was 101 32 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2. When evaluating agreement between these formulas and iGFR (e. g. correlation, Bland Altman plots, bias, and accuracies), there was a good correlation between iGFR and all Le Bricon, Larsson, Rule, and Zappitelli (both) and locally adapted Schwartz and 2009 Schwartz formulas; by contrast, Filler and original 1976 Schwartz formulas overestimated iGFR, whereas Hoek and Bouvet formulas underestimated iGFR.
