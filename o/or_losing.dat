5|$|Others are obscure {{because of}} the damnatio memoriae {{surrounding}} the lives of antipopes, or because they were refused burial due to excommunication. Some of those can be presumed to have been buried unceremoniously in the monasteries to which the antipopes were confined after submitting <b>or</b> <b>losing</b> power. The exception is Hippolytus of Rome, the first antipope, who was translated to Rome by his former rival Pope Fabian following his martyrdom, and {{is regarded as a}} saint.|$|E
5|$|Silk {{is mainly}} {{composed}} of a protein {{very similar to that}} used in insect silk. It is initially a liquid, and hardens not by exposure to air but as a result of being drawn out, which changes the internal structure of the protein. It is similar in tensile strength to nylon and biological materials such as chitin, collagen and cellulose, but is much more elastic. In other words, it can stretch much further before breaking <b>or</b> <b>losing</b> shape.|$|E

These range from the thermally unstable FClO to the chemically unreactive perchloryl fluoride (FClO3), the other three being FClO2, F3ClO, and F3ClO2. All five behave similarly to the chlorine fluorides, both structurally and chemically, and may act as Lewis acids or bases by gaining <b>or</b> <b>losing</b> fluoride ions respectively or as very strong oxidising and fluorinating agents.|$|E
5|$|Belief that Cooper did {{not survive}} was bolstered {{by the fact that}} none of the money has ever been used. A {{quantity}} was found under riverbank silt, but its location is not consistent with Cooper dying <b>or</b> <b>losing</b> the ransom in the jump. This, combined with the knowledge that with law enforcement involved, a ransom would in effect be 100% bait money (a fact known to the public since the trial following the Lindbergh kidnapping) makes it less likely that Cooper had any intention of actually using the ransom money. A minority opinion is that a North American of Cooper's apparent sophistication could hardly have expected to spend or fence currency as hot as the ransom would predictably be, and he had carried out a planned dumping of the money before disappearing.|$|E
5|$|The Yukon Quest's rules allow race {{officials}} latitude {{on whether}} to assess a time penalty or monetary fine on mushers who violate one or more regulations. The most serious penalties can be assessed for mistreating dogs. Racers have been forcibly removed from the race for inadequate dog care; the most recent instance of this took place in 2008, when Donald Smidt was removed. More common are minor time and monetary penalties. For example, Dan Kaduce was fined $500 of his eventual $9,000 winnings for missing roll call at a mandatory meeting in 2007. Fines of $500 also have been levied for not attending the finish banquet, littering, not wearing start and finish bibs, <b>or</b> <b>losing</b> veterinary records. These minor penalties can {{have an effect on}} the race. In 2009, Hugh Neff, then in second place, was penalized two hours for mushing on the Circle Hot Springs road. As a result, he finished four minutes behind Sebastian Schnuelle, the winner.|$|E

5|$|Now {{known as}} Takanohana, {{he was also}} the {{youngest}} ever to be promoted to ōzeki at 20years 5months. With the foreign born Akebono as sumo's only yokozuna, there was a great weight of expectation on Takanohana to make the next step up. However, his lack of consistency, and Akebono's dominance, delayed his promotion to yokozuna. He won his third championship in May 1993, but lost a playoff to Akebono in the following tournament in July, and even produced a make-koshi <b>or</b> <b>losing</b> score of 7–8 in November. In 1994, a year in which Akebono suffered several injury problems, Takanohana won the January and May tournaments, but was then outshone by Musashimaru, who won in July with a perfect 15–0 record. After taking the September 1994 championship, Takanohana now had six top division titles, but none had been won consecutively. No previous wrestler had ever accumulated so many titles before reaching sumo's highest rank. The Sumo Association nominated him for yokozuna after the September tournament, but the Yokozuna Deliberation Council failed to endorse it by the required two-thirds majority, the first time this had happened in twenty five years. They insisted that two consecutive championships were required, having demanded the same of Akebono before his promotion. In November 1994, Takanohana at last managed to win two consecutive tournaments, with his second consecutive unbeaten 15–0 score, and his promotion was confirmed. He had been at the ōzeki rank for 11 tournaments, or nearly two years. However, at 22years and 3months, he was still the third youngest yokozuna ever at the time.|$|E

25|$|Cricket imposes {{penalties}} on captains {{if their}} players bowl their overs {{at a very}} slow rate, such as fines, loss of competition points, and match bans. If a team is proceeding slowly, some captains will choose to use slow/spin bowlers. Such bowlers have a shorter run up so they complete their overs more quickly. Often this means choosing an inferior strategy by employing a less skillful bowler to avoid penalties that {{are perceived to be}} greater, such as being banned <b>or</b> <b>losing</b> points.|$|E

The winner is determined not by the snitch catch but by the number of points earned throughout the entirety of the game play. Depending on the score teams will delay the snitch catch in order to better their chances of winning. Teams that are losing will defend the snitch by placing themselves between the Snitch Runner and the opposing seeker.|$|E
25|$|Strongheart's {{mainstream}} name before adulthood was George Mitchell Jr. At {{some point}} his official {{status as a}} member of the Yakama Nation ended. At a performance in 1927 he said that when his military service ended he had the choice of returning to the reservation <b>or</b> <b>losing</b> his tribal rights. It is reported that he did return but did not remain at the reservation. He began to document his relationship with the Yakama Nation in the 1930s; he was honorarily adopted by a Yakama family during the administration of the 1946 Yakima Enrollment Act after having helped the Tomaskin family. Leonard Tomaskin would have been 22 yrs old in 1946; 22 years later he was elected chairman of the General Council of the Yakama Nation, serving from 1968 to 1983.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{many other}} legal dramas (e.g., The Defenders, Matlock, Perry Mason and L.A. Law), the court {{proceedings}} are shown from the prosecution's point of view, with the regular characters {{trying to prove}} the defendant's guilt, not innocence. After the arraignment of defendants,the D.A.s proceed to trial preparation, including legal research and plea negotiations. Some episodes include legal proceedings beyond the testimony of witnesses, including motion hearings, (often concerning admissibility of evidence); jury selection; and allocutions, usually {{as a result of}} plea bargains. Many episodes employ motions to suppress evidence as a plot device, and most of these end with evidence or statements being suppressed, often on a technicality. This usually begins with the service of the motion to the D.A. team, follows with argument and case citations of precedent before a judge in court, and concludes with visual reaction of the winning <b>or</b> <b>losing</b> attorney.|$|E
25|$|Colaprete et al. {{conducted}} simulations {{with the}} Mars General Circulation Model which {{show that the}} local climate around the Martian south pole may currently be in an unstable period. The simulated instability {{is rooted in the}} geography of the region, leading the authors to speculate that the sublimation of the polar ice is a local phenomenon rather than a global one. The researchers showed that even with a constant solar luminosity the poles were capable of jumping between states of depositing <b>or</b> <b>losing</b> ice. The trigger for a change of states could be either increased dust loading in the atmosphere or an albedo change due to deposition of water ice on the polar cap. This theory is somewhat problematic {{due to the lack of}} ice depositation after the 2001 global dust storm. Another issue is that the accuracy of the Mars General Circulation Model decreases as the scale of the phenomenon becomes more local.|$|E
25|$|EPI has {{developed}} several software products to support educators. In 2006, EPI developed the Institutional Student Retention Assessment (ISRA), {{which serves as}} a web-based campus audit system focused on student retention. The ISRA was developed with funding from Lumina Foundation for Education. That same year, with support from TG, EPI created the Effective Practices in Student Success (EPSS) database. The EPSS currently includes 141 programs from across the US and Canada with evidence-based strategies for postsecondary access and success. In 2007, EPI created the Retention Calculator, which calculates the benefit-cost of saving <b>or</b> <b>losing</b> students in higher education institutions and systems. EPI unveiled the EPI-DAS in 2009, a longitudinal data management system {{that can be used in}} conjunction with GEAR UP and other education initiatives to track individual students, collect and analyze data, and generate reports based on findings. EPI-DAS is designed to meet the reporting requirements of the federal government under the No Child Left Behind Act.|$|E

5000|$|In {{this process}} {{electrons}} are either absorbed or released. Neutral atoms gain <b>or</b> <b>lose</b> electrons and become charged ions that then {{pass into the}} electrolyte. The formation of uncharged atoms from ions is called discharging. When an ion gains <b>or</b> <b>loses</b> enough electrons to become uncharged (neutral) atoms, the newly formed atoms separate from the electrolyte. Positive metal ions like Cu++ [...] deposit onto the cathode in a layer. The terms for this are electroplating, electrowinning, and electrorefining. When an ion gains <b>or</b> <b>loses</b> electrons without becoming neutral, its electronic charge is altered in the process. In chemistry, the loss of electrons is called Oxidation, while electron gain is called reduction.|$|R
