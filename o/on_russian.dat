The Russian team potentially could be stripped of up to 12 Olympic medals among these athletes alone.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1904, Piłsudski formed a {{paramilitary}} unit (the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party, or bojówki) aiming to create an armed resistance movement against the Russian authorities. The PPS organized an increasing numbers of demonstrations, mainly in Warsaw; on 28 October 1904, Russian Cossack cavalry attacked a demonstration, and in reprisal, during a demonstration on 13 November Piłsudski's paramilitary opened fire <b>on</b> <b>Russian</b> police and military. Initially concentrating their attention on spies and informers, in March 1905 the paramilitary began using bombs to assassinate selected Russian police officers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} from late 1944, more Eastern European {{formations}} were hurriedly raised by Berger's recruiters or converted from existing smaller units. These included the 25th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Hunyadi (1st Hungarian), 26th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Hungarian), 31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division, {{and a number of}} smaller formations of brigade and regimental size. Several Cossack units were also transferred from the Wehrmacht. Even the Sonderkommando Dirlewanger was increased in size, taking <b>on</b> <b>Russian</b> prisoners of war to boost its numbers.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February 2010, the Prime Minister of Russia, Vladimir Putin, invited his Polish counterpart, Donald Tusk, {{to attend}} a Katyn {{memorial}} service in April.

Before the visit, the 2007 film Katyń was shown <b>on</b> <b>Russian</b> state television for the first time. The Moscow Times commented that the film's premiere in Russia was likely a result of Putin's intervention.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Moscow–Vladivostok route, {{completed in}} 1904, cut across China's northeastern provinces, or Manchuria; {{the section of}} the railway located within China was known as the Chinese Eastern Railway.

5|$|World {{demand for}} {{palladium}} increased from 100 tons in 1990 to nearly 300tons in 2000.

Many are concerned about {{a steady supply of}} palladium in the wake of Russia's military maneuvers in Ukraine, partly as sanctions could hamper Russian palladium exports; any restrictions <b>on</b> <b>Russian</b> palladium exports would exacerbate what is already expected to be a large palladium deficit in 2014.|$|E

5|$|After the Ottoman Empire entered World War I, Berk-i Satvet was {{employed}} in patrols in the Black Sea. These included attacks <b>on</b> <b>Russian</b> ports with the ex-German warships Yavuz Sultan Selim and Midilli. In January 1915, Berk-i Satvet struck a naval mine while escorting a convoy to Zonguldak; the explosion severely damaged {{the ship and}} kept her out of service until April 1918. For {{the remainder of the}} war, she patrolled the Black Sea. The ship was renamed Berk in 1923 and modernized twice, in the mid-1920s and in the late-1930s. She remained in service until 1944, when she was stricken from the naval register. Berk was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1953–55.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{political}} connections and his mastery of French, McClellan received the assignment to be an official observer of the European armies in the Crimean War in 1855. Traveling widely, and interacting with the highest military commands and royal families, McClellan observed the siege of Sevastopol. Upon {{his return to the}} United States in 1856 he requested assignment in Philadelphia to prepare his report, which contained a critical analysis of the siege and a lengthy description of the organization of the European armies. He also wrote a manual on cavalry tactics that was based <b>on</b> <b>Russian</b> cavalry regulations. Like other observers, though, McClellan did not appreciate the importance of the emergence of rifled muskets in the Crimean War, and the fundamental changes in warfare tactics it would require.|$|E
5|$|In May 1890, Maria—who {{retained}} societal {{influence as}} {{the widow of}} a nobleman—persuaded the authorities to allow Lenin to take his exams externally at the University of St Petersburg, where he obtained {{the equivalent of a}} first-class degree with honours. The graduation celebrations were marred when his sister Olga died of typhoid. Lenin remained in Samara for several years, working first as a legal assistant for a regional court and then for a local lawyer. He devoted much time to radical politics, remaining active in Skylarenko's group and formulating ideas about how Marxism applied to Russia. Inspired by Plekhanov's work, Lenin collected data <b>on</b> <b>Russian</b> society, using it to support a Marxist interpretation of societal development and counter the claims of the Narodniks. He wrote a paper on peasant economics; it was rejected by the liberal journal Russian Thought.|$|E

5|$|König {{departed}} Kiel on 23 September for Putziger Wiek, {{where the}} ship remained until 10 October. The operation began on 12 October; at 03:00 König anchored off Ösel in Tagga Bay and disembarked soldiers. By 05:50, König opened fire <b>on</b> <b>Russian</b> coastal artillery emplacements, joined by Moltke, Bayern, {{and the other}} three König-class ships. Simultaneously, the Kaiser-class ships engaged the batteries on the Sworbe peninsula; the objective was to secure the channel between Moon and Dagö islands, which would block the only escape route of the Russian ships in the Gulf. Both Grosser Kurfürst and Bayern struck mines while maneuvering into their bombardment positions, with minimal damage to the former. Bayern was severely wounded, and had to be withdrawn to Kiel for repairs. At 17:30, König departed the area to refuel; she returned to the Irben Strait on 15 October.|$|E

5|$|Janáček's {{deep and}} lifelong affection for Russia and Russian culture {{represents}} another {{important element of}} his musical inspiration. In 1888 he attended the Prague performance of Tchaikovsky's music, and met the older composer. Janáček profoundly admired Tchaikovsky, and particularly appreciated his highly developed musical thought {{in connection with the}} use of Russian folk motifs. Janáček's Russian inspiration is especially apparent in his later chamber, symphonic and operatic output. He closely followed developments in Russian music from his early years, and in 1896, following his first visit of Russia, he founded a Russian Circle in Brno. Janáček read Russian authors in their original language. Their literature offered him an enormous and reliable source of inspiration, though this did not blind him to the problems of Russian society. He was twenty-two years old when he wrote his first composition based on a Russian theme: a melodrama, Death, set to Lermontov's poem. In his later works, he often used literary models with sharply contoured plots. In 1910 Zhukovsky's Tale of Tsar Berendei inspired him to write the Fairy Tale for Cello and Piano. He composed the rhapsody Taras Bulba (1918) to Gogol's short story, and five years later, in 1923, completed his first string quartet, inspired by Tolstoy's Kreutzer Sonata. Two of his later operas were based <b>on</b> <b>Russian</b> themes: Káťa Kabanová, composed in 1921 to Alexander Ostrovsky's play, The Storm: and his last work, From the House of the Dead, which transformed Dostoyevsky's vision of the world into an exciting collective drama.|$|E

5|$|Through his {{paternal}} family, Filitti {{descended from}} historical figures whose careers were {{intertwined with the}} history of Wallachia, the Romanian subregion and former autonomous state. It originated with ethnic Greek migrants from the Epirus—where the Filitti family was known to be residing in the 17th century. The main settlers were male monks, whose presence was attested in Buzău County around 1786: rising through the ranks of the Romanian Orthodox Church, Dositei Filitti served as Wallachian Metropolitan Bishop, assigning nephew Constandie to preside over the Diocese of Buzău. Although his Epirote father was a noted Russophile, the Metropolitan regarded himself as a liberal-minded Wallachian patriot: he founded the local school of divinity, provided scholarships to young Wallachians, and sponsored the growing printing industry. In tandem, he spoke out against the practice of slavery, protecting Romani women from their Wallachian masters and donating money for the release of devșirme victims. During times of turmoil, when Wallachia effectively became a dominion of the Russian Empire, Dositei was swiftly deposed <b>on</b> <b>Russian</b> orders.|$|E
