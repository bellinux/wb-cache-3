5|$|In 1993, Jake and Dinos Chapman of the Young British Artists {{movement}} created 82 miniature, toy-like sculptures modelled on The Disasters of War. The {{works were}} widely acclaimed and purchased that {{year by the}} Tate gallery. For decades, Goya's series of etching served as a constant point of reference for the Chapman brothers; in particular, they created a number of variations based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> Grande hazaña! Con muertos!.|$|E
5|$|That same year, J.J. Thomson {{conducted}} {{an experiment in}} which he channeled a stream of neon ions through magnetic and electric fields, striking a photographic plate at the other end. He observed two glowing patches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate,</b> which suggested two different deflection trajectories. Thomson concluded this was {{because some of the}} neon ions had a different mass. The nature of this differing mass would later be explained by the discovery of neutrons in 1932.|$|E

2500|$|Smith's first {{published}} description of <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> said that <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> [...] "had <b>the</b> appearance of gold". They were described by Martin Harris, one of Smith's early scribes, as [...] "fastened {{together in the}} shape of a book by wires." [...] Smith called <b>the</b> engraved writing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> [...] "reformed Egyptian". A portion of <b>the</b> text <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> was also [...] "sealed" [...] according to his account, so its content was not included in the Book of Mormon.|$|R
25|$|To {{quantify}} {{the number of}} cells in a culture, the cells can be simply plated on a petri dish with growth medium. If the cells are efficiently distributed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate,</b> it can be generally assumed that each cell will {{give rise to a}} single colony or Colony Forming Unit (CFU). The colonies can then be counted, and based on the known volume of culture that was spread <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate,</b> the cell concentration can be calculated.|$|E

25|$|The {{diversity}} of geodynamic settings and {{the properties of}} each plate result from {{the impact of the}} various processes actively driving each individual plate. One method of dealing with this problem is to consider the relative rate at which each plate is moving as well as the evidence related to the significance of each process to the overall driving force <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
25|$|The special Passover Seder plate (ke'are) is {{a special}} plate {{containing}} symbolic foods used during the Passover Seder. Each of the six items arranged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> has special significance to the retelling {{of the story of}} the Exodus from Egypt. The seventh symbolic item used during the meal—a stack of three matzot—is placed on its own plate on the Seder table.|$|E
25|$|Slab suction (gravity): Plate motion {{driven by}} local {{convection}} currents that exert a downward pull on plates in subduction zones at ocean trenches. Slab suction may {{occur in a}} geodynamic setting where basal tractions continue to act <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> as it dives into the mantle (although perhaps {{to a greater extent}} acting on both the under and upper side of the slab).|$|E

30|$|Air-injection holes (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>plate)</b> of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5  mm in {{diameter}} at a spacing of 25 and 50  mm between {{the centers of}} adjacent holes were used. There were 121 holes {{in an area of}} 250  ×  250  mm for the 25 -mm spacing and 36 holes for the 50 -mm spacing. Holes were also punched <b>on</b> <b>the</b> caul <b>plate</b> (upper <b>plate)</b> through which <b>the</b> high-pressure air and vapor were discharged. Also <b>on</b> <b>the</b> caul <b>plate</b> were 121 and 36 holes in an area of 250  ×  250  mm for the 25 - and 50 -mm spacing, respectively. Grooves that were 1.5 -mm deep and 1 -mm wide were also cut connecting <b>the</b> holes <b>on</b> one side of <b>the</b> caul <b>plate</b> to discharge <b>the</b> high-pressure air. The diameter and spacing of <b>the</b> holes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> caul <b>plate</b> were <b>the</b> same as those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>plate.</b> For example, <b>the</b> hole diameter and spacing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> caul <b>plate</b> would be 1 and 25  mm, respectively, if the hole diameter and spacing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>plate</b> were 1 and 5  mm, respectively.

25|$|Individual {{microorganisms}} placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> {{will grow}} into individual colonies, each a clone genetically {{identical to the}} individual ancestor organism (except for the low, unavoidable rate of mutation). Thus, the plate can be used either to estimate the concentration of organisms in a liquid culture or a suitable dilution of that culture using a colony counter, or to generate genetically pure cultures from a mixed culture of genetically different organisms.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{to that in}} Arab countries, {{bread is}} served with most meals and is {{generally}} torn into shreds and used by those eating to envelope foods, {{so that they can}} be picked up and conveyed to the mouth, in a manner similar to a sandwich, and also to soak up liquids <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b> Since people in Afghanistan normally use their hands to eat, the bread thus acts as both a fork and a spoon.|$|E
25|$|The presses {{first used}} {{were of the}} {{ordinary}} letterpress type, the engraved plate being fixed {{in the place of}} the type. In later improvements the well-known cylinder press was employed; the plate was inked mechanically and cleaned off by passing under a sharp blade of steel; and the cloth, instead of being laid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate,</b> was passed round the pressure cylinder. The plate was raised into frictional contact with the cylinder and in passing under it transferred its ink to the cloth.|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{a possibility}} of removing smog particles from a boiler smoke. To do this, the boiler smoke is passed through a flow of gamma radiation, formed by interaction of the microtron beam with a heavy target. The energy of the microtron electrons twenty five megaelectronvolts, the beam current one hundred microamperes. Smog particles are ionized with gamma radiation and then sat down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> of <b>the</b> electrostatic filter. The height of <b>the</b> filter <b>plates</b> is one m, the electric field between <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> one kilovolt per centimeter. <b>The</b> smog particles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> should be removed regularly to a specialized dust collector.

25|$|The multiwell {{plates are}} {{manufactured}} to allow researchers {{to create and}} manipulate different types of assays (i.e., bioassays, immunoassays, etc.) within each multiwell plate. Due to the variability in multiwell plate formatting, {{it is not uncommon}} for artifacts to arise. Artifacts are due to the different environments found within the different wells <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate,</b> especially near the edges and center of the wells. Such effects are known as well effects, edge effects, and plate effects. Thus, emphasizing the necessity to position assay designs in the correct manner both within, and between, each plate.|$|E
25|$|Rosenzweig {{suffered}} from the muscular degenerative disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease). Towards {{the end of his}} life, he had to write {{with the help of his}} wife, Edith, who would recite letters of the alphabet until he indicated for her to stop, continuing until she could guess the word or phrase he intended (or, at other times, Rosenzweig would point to the letter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> of his typewriter). They also developed a communication system based on him blinking his eyes.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} Enigma rotors, each rotor drum of the bombe had two complete sets of contacts, one for input towards the reflector {{and the other}} for output from the reflector, so that the reflected signal could pass back through a separate set of contacts. Each drum had 104 wire brushes, which made contact with the plate onto which they were loaded. The brushes and the corresponding set of contacts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> were arranged in four concentric circles of 26. The outer pair of circles (input and output) were equivalent to the current in an Enigma passing in one direction through the scrambler, and the inner pair equivalent to the current flowing in the opposite direction.|$|E
50|$|The {{data sheet}} {{information}} {{supplied by the}} tube manufacturers design centers, list the typical operation of an audio output stage for a single 6V6 as producing about 5W of continuous power, and a push-pull pair about 14W. Amplifier manufacturers soon realized that the tube was capable of being used at ratings above the recommended maximums, and guitar amplifiers with 400V <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> {{of a pair of}} 6V6GTA claim to produce an output power of 20W RMS at 5%THD with 40W Peak Music Power, and with 490V <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plates,</b> as much as 30W RMS.|$|R

25|$|A few {{isolated}} outcropping seamounts that pierce {{through more}} than 200 m of impermeable sediments, are conduits that allow hydrologic exchange between the open ocean and the upper oceanic crust—the largest aquifer of the planet. The Cascadia Basin site {{is placed in the}} vicinity of several circulation obviation retrofit kit (CORK) borehole observatories, which are designed to study the hydrology, geochemistry and microbiology of the upper oceanic crust. CORKs are also being used to investigate changes in regional plate strain that are caused by earthquakes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> boundaries. The seafloor pressure measurements of the CORK borehole observatories constitute the center of a “tsunami-meter”, a network of several high precision, rapid sampling bottom pressure recorders (BPRs), that allows precise determination of deep water tsunami amplitude, direction of propagation, and speed.|$|E
25|$|Other computer-generated {{imagery in}} the film {{includes}} the ant coming out of Dae-su's arm (according to the making-of on the DVD the whole arm was CGI) and the ants crawling over him afterwards. The octopus being eaten alive was not computer-generated; four were used during the making of this scene. Actor Choi Min-sik, a Buddhist, said a prayer for each one. The eating of squirming octopuses (called san-nakji (산낙지) in Korean) as a delicacy exists in East Asia, although it is usually killed and cut, not eaten whole and alive. Usually, it is the nerve activity in the octopus' tentacles makes the pieces still squirming posthumously <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> when served. When asked in DVD commentary if he felt sorry for Choi, director Park Chan-wook stated he felt more sorry for the octopus.|$|E
25|$|In offset lithography, which {{depends on}} {{photographic}} processes, flexible aluminum, polyester, mylar or paper printing plates {{are used in}} place of stone tablets. Modern printing plates have a brushed or roughened texture and are covered with a photosensitive emulsion. A photographic negative of the desired image is placed {{in contact with the}} emulsion and the plate is exposed to ultraviolet light. After development, the emulsion shows a reverse of the negative image, which is thus a duplicate of the original (positive) image. The image <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> emulsion can also be created through direct laser imaging in a CTP (Computer-To-Plate) device called a platesetter. The positive image is the emulsion that remains after imaging. For many years, chemicals have been used to remove the non-image emulsion, but now plates are available that do not require chemical processing.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluate}} the renormalized vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of electric and magnetic fields squared and the energy-momentum tensor for the electromagnetic {{field in the}} geometry of two parallel conducting plates on background of cosmic string spacetime. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> base of these results, <b>the</b> Casimir-Polder force <b>on</b> a polarizable particle and the Casimir forces acting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> are investigated. <b>The</b> VEVs are decomposed into the pure string and plate-induced parts. The VEV of the electric field squared is negative for points with radial distance to the string smaller than the distance to <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> and positive for <b>the</b> opposite situation. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand the VEV for the magnetic field squared is negative everywhere. The boundary induced part in the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is different from zero in the region between <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> only. Moreover, this part only depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> distance from the string. The boundary-induced part in the vacuum energy density is positive for points with distance to the string smaller than the distance to <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> and negative in opposite situation. <b>The</b> Casimir stresses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> depend non-monotonically <b>on</b> <b>the</b> distance from the string. We show that the Casimir forces acting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> are always attractive. Comment: 15 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
