50|$|Since the Pleistocene, the {{buoyancy}} <b>of</b> the South <b>Atlantic</b> thermocline and {{the strength}} <b>of</b> the <b>Atlantic</b> meridional overturning circulation has been regulated by the shedding of warm, saline Agulhas Rings. The Agulhas leakage affects the Atlantic thermocline on a decadal timescale and over centuries it can change the buoyancy <b>of</b> the <b>Atlantic</b> thermocline and therefore the formation rates <b>of</b> North <b>Atlantic</b> Deep Water (NADW).|$|R

Fish originally included hundreds of thousands <b>of</b> <b>Atlantic</b> tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds <b>of</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sturgeon.
