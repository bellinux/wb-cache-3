40|$|The {{procedure}} used {{to determine}} polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated terphenyls (PCTs), chlorinated dibenzodioxins, and chlorinated dibenzofurans is outlined in Table 1. It {{is based on the}} cleanup-chromatography of Holden and Marsden (1), modified as described (2). Most PCBs are eluted in fraction I. Fraction II contains some PCBs, p, p'-DDE, and PCTs, whereas heptachlor exposide, dieldrin, endrin, p,p'-DDD, and p, p'-DDT are eluted in fraction III. Fractions I and II are further chromatographed on alumina, essentially according to Porter and Burke (3), to determine chlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans. PCTs, hexa- and <b>octachlorodibenzodioxin,</b> and octachlorodibenzofuran were quantified by gas chromatography on 3 % OV- 210 on Chromosorb WAW 60 / 80 in a 6 ft X 4 mm column at 200 Â°C. A 4 % SE- 30 column was used to quantify PCBs, chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides, 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, di-, tri-, and tetrachlorodibenzofuran. Recovery of PCBs and chlorinated hydrocarbo...|$|E

40|$|Both authors contributed {{equally to}} this work and are {{considered}} co-first authors Eight marine sediments from Busan port in Korea were annually analyzed {{to examine the}} concentration distribution of dioxins from 2006 to 2010. Yearly mean concentration of dioxins ranged from 186. 3 to 383. 3 pg g- 1 in real values and 5. 087 to 8. 541 pg-TEQ (Toxicity equivalency) based on dry weight of samples. The dioxin concentration at the site near fishing market was the highest concentration among all sampling sites. Also the dioxin concentration at the sites with various pollutant sources such as large ships, sewage influx and thermal power station as well as fishing market was {{higher than that of}} the sites without specific pollutant sources. Another main factor that affects the dioxin concentration is topography characteristics of the bay. The bay has relatively high dioxin concentration {{because of the lack of}} the pollutant diffusion. This study demonstrated that the dioxin concentration in the site with pollutant sources and the lack of the pollutant diffusion was relatively high as compared with the other sites. As a result of contribution ratio of dioxin congeners, OCDD (<b>Octachlorodibenzodioxin)</b> in all sites was major contributor in real value, in contrast, dioxin congeners in TEQ values were dominated by 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -PeCDF...|$|E
40|$|An <b>octachlorodibenzodioxin</b> (OCDD) -dominated {{contamination}} {{is present}} {{along the coast}} of Queensland, Australia. Several findings indicate that this contamination originates from pesticide use, although due to limited information on OCDD levels in the pesticides used, estimating past and current emissions of OCDD solely from pesticide use data is unfeasible. We used all the qualitative and quantitative information available on OCDD in pesticides together with a previously validated chemical fate model for a catchment in the Queensland Wet Tropics to back-calculate the emissions of OCDD from measured soil concentrations. We estimate that under different emission scenarios an average of 2, 500 kg of OCDD was emitted within the modelled 1, 685 km(2) (Tully river) catchment between 1950 and 2010. Because this catchment represents only approximately 0. 85 % of the whole coast of Queensland under a similar contamination, the total amount of OCDD released in this region is considerably larger. For all emission scenarios, we could show that the OCDD currently present in agricultural soil is a result of historical emissions, and current-day emissions are less important in comparison to past emissions. Overall 18 % was lost by degradation and 62 % was buried below the agricultural surface soil, as a result of facilitated transport. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{have demonstrated the}} presence of an unidentified source of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) in the coastal zone of Queensland (Australia). The present study provides new information on the possible PCDD sources and their temporal input to this environment. Two estuarine sediment cores were collected in northern Queensland for which radiochemical chronologies were established. Core sections from different depositional ages, up to three centuries, have been analyzed for 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted PCDDs and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). Variations of PCDD concentrations in the sediment cores over several centuries of depositional history were relatively small, and elevated PCDD levels were still present in sediment slices from the early 17 th century. PCDD/F isomer patterns and congener profiles in sediments deposited during the last 350 years were almost identical and correlated well to the characteristic profiles observed in surface sediments and soils from the entire Queensland coastline. Profiles were dominated by higher chlorinated PCDDs, in particular <b>octachlorodibenzodioxin</b> (OCDD), whereas PCDF concentrations were below or near the limit of detection. These results indicate the presence of a PCDD source prior to industrialization and production of commercial organochlorine products. Further, the present study demonstrates that PCDD input patterns have been similar along an extensive but localized area over at least several centuries, contributing relatively high concentrations of PCDDs to the coastal system of Queensland...|$|E
40|$|Schistosomiasis has {{prevailed in}} some areas of China for a long time. Chinese {{technical}} sodium pentachlorophenate (Na-PCP) has been used to control the spread of snail-borne schistosomiasis since the 1960 s. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), impurities contained in the Na-PCP, enter the soil and may accumulate in the food chain. In order to evaluate their potentially harmful effects on local residents, 50 breast milk samples and 20 blood samples were collected in 2004 from residents in the Dongting Lake area, one of China's known schistosomiasis areas. Levels of 17 PCDD/F congeners were measured in all samples, and DNA damage was simultaneously assessed in blood samples. The PCDD/F congener distribution patterns in human tissue samples from the Dongting Lake area were similar to those in Na-PCP, and the <b>octachlorodibenzodioxin</b> (OCDD) congener was predominant in all samples. We also had a primary investigation that the breast milk WHO-TEQ associated with some factors such as: age, dietary habit, body mass index (BMI) and the total menses times. In blood samples, the samples with higher OCDD level had higher DDS (DNA damage score) values than those samples with low OCDD level, which indicated that the higher DNA damage value in general population might be caused directly or indirectly by PCDD/Fs. The results also indicated that the WHO-TEQ values in blood were associated with age (r = 0. 6, p = 0. 007). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Remediation of {{weathered}} petroleum hydrocarbons, polycyclic {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs), dioxins, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) through monitored natural attenuation, in-situ biostimulation, and/or bioaugmentation was assessed using laboratory-scale microcosms. These contaminants of interest (COIs) have persisted in Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) soils for over 40 years in some cases. The objective of this United States Department of Energy (DOE) -funded {{study was to determine}} the potential of the aforementioned remediation methods to reduce COI concentrations in soil and estimate potential biodegradation rates of COIs in SSFL soils. Several types of soil microcosms were established: one set of microcosms was run without amendments to estimate natural attenuation rates at the site; biostimulation was tested by addition of nitrogen and phosphorus, rice hulls, and biosurfactant (soya lecithin), another set was augmented with the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, and gamma-irradiated microcosms served as sterilized controls. Soil samples were collected and analyzed for dioxins, PCBs, PAHs, and extractable fuel hydrocarbons (EFH) after 0, 4, and 8 months of incubation. Soil contamination in the microcosms initially consisted of primarily heavily chlorinated dioxins and PCBs, longer petroleum hydrocarbons (21 - 40 equivalent carbon chain length), and PAHs with 4 - 6 aromatic rings. Small decreases in PAH, PCB, and dioxin soil concentrations were observed, but these decreases were not statistically significant. EFH concentrations were inflated at the final sampling event, but they appeared to reduce for two of three soils (Soils A and C) tested at the second sampling event. No COI concentration reductions were statistically significantly during 8 months of incubation. Because petroleum hydrocarbons were primarily longer-chain hydrocarbons in the C 21 to C 40 EFH range, it is likely that lighter hydrocarbons had been preferentially degraded, leaving the more recalcitrant longer-chain hydrocarbons in the soil. Dioxin concentrations appeared to decrease in some cases, but these reductions were not statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. Larger PAHs (4 - 6 rings) comprise the majority of residual PAH soil contamination. Given that concentrations of these PAHs have not decreased significantly during this 8 -month long study, it is likely that these larger PAH contaminants are somewhat recalcitrant and will take a long time to biodegrade. Similarly, little or no PCB biodegradation was observed which is not surprising because the PCBs are heavily chlorinated, and bacterial biodegradation of these highly chlorinated compounds is reported to occur only under anaerobic conditions. The primary dioxin congener present in soils was <b>octachlorodibenzodioxin</b> (OCDD), which is the heaviest-chlorinated dioxin congener. Like PCBs, this compound requires anaerobic conditions for reductive dechlorination, and these are not present at the site. Total dioxin concentrations decreased in the microcosms amended with Phanerochaete chrysosporium, although this decrease was not statistically significant due to variability of dioxin concentrations measured in the soil. No decrease in tetrachlorodibenzodioxin toxicity equivalence was observed with P. chrysosporium bioaugmentation, and this parameter is important in terms of dioxin toxicity. Soil vapor analyses performed at the site indicate highly aerobic soil conditions. To mimic site conditions as closely as possible, experimental microcosms were maintained incubated in aerobic conditions. Although fungi have been reported to degrade PCBs and dioxins under aerobic conditions, the microcosms augmented with Phanerochaete chrysosporium did not show statistically significant biodegradation of PCBs. Contaminant sequestration in the soil may also have contributed to the lack of observed biodegradation because the COIs at this site are highly weathered. However, even microcosms augmented with a surfactant (soya lecithin), which would be expected to solubilize sequestered COIs, did not show significant biodegradation...|$|E
