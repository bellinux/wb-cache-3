5|$|Late in Friday's {{first season}} in Wales, Cardiff took on Luton Town on 16 April 1977. Cardiff {{were in the}} relegation zone and had not won in seven games, while Luton were fifth in the table and {{challenging}} for promotion. After clashing repeatedly early in the match with Luton goalkeeper Milija Aleksic, Friday was lectured by the referee for a high tackle on the goalkeeper in the 36th minute. Friday held <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> apologise, but Aleksic reacted angrily. When the free kick was taken, Friday ran back, stole the ball from Luton defender John Faulkner, broke away, rounded Aleksic and slotted the ball past him into the net. In celebration, Friday jogged back past the goalkeeper while giving him the V-sign. Cardiff won the match 4–2 {{and at the end}} of the season avoided relegation to the third tier only on goal difference. Meanwhile, without Friday, Reading were relegated back to the Fourth Division by one point. Friday's actions became even stranger during his time at Cardiff; after they lost the second leg of the Welsh Cup final 3–0 to Shrewsbury Town on 18 May 1977, the players and staff were awoken in the middle of the night by loud bangs coming from below their rooms. The cause was found to be Friday, standing on the hotel's snooker table in his underpants and throwing the balls around the room in fury.|$|E
25|$|Essex's army, {{for want}} of {{material}} resources, had had to be content with the capture of Reading. A Royalist force under Hertford and Prince Maurice von Simmern (Rupert's brother) moved {{out as far as}} Salisbury to hold <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> their friends in Devonshire. Waller, the only Parliamentary commander left in the field in the west, had to abandon his conquests in the Severn valley to oppose the further progress of his intimate friend and present enemy, Hopton.|$|E
500|$|England drew 0–0 {{in their}} opening group {{game of the}} World Cup against Uruguay after the South Americans came {{to play for a}} draw. They then beat Mexico 2–0 after a [...] "tremendous goal" [...] from Bobby Charlton opened up the game shortly before the half-time whistle. England beat France 2–0 in the final group game, with Charlton {{assisting}} Roger Hunt after heading the ball onto the post. England eliminated Argentina in the quarter finals with a 1–0 win – their efforts were greatly aided after Argentine centre-half Antonio Rattín was sent off for dissent, after which Argentina stopped attacking the ball and concentrated of holding out for a draw with their aggressive defending. England's opponents in the semi-finals were Portugal, who had giant centre-forward José Augusto Torres to compete with Charlton for aerial balls. Late in the game Charlton gave away a penalty by sticking <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> stop Torres from scoring; Eusébio scored the penalty but was largely contained by Nobby Stiles, and England won the game 2–1 after two goals from Bobby Charlton.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gawd Almighty!" [...] gasped Larry, {{and he put}} <b>out</b> <b>a</b> shaking <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> clutch Neale. [...] "The Injuns! I always feared this--spite of Slingerland's talk." ...|$|R
60|$|She held <b>out</b> <b>an</b> ungloved <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> him as {{he stepped}} up to the automobile. Having gained her ends, she was {{disposed}} to be merciful.|$|R
60|$|I was at {{once again}} the centre of attention, and Mr. Obstinate rose very laboriously from his settle and held <b>out</b> <b>a</b> great <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> me.|$|R
2500|$|On 19 February 2015, it was {{revealed}} West had already filmed his final scenes and left the show. Former Fawlty Towers star, Andrew Sachs, was announced to be joining the show on 10 March 2015 as Cyril Bishop, roommate of Stan when he is admitted to hospital. Sachs' first scenes were announced to air on 18 March 2015. Cyril died in the following episode, saddening Stan. Bradshaw-White teased Stan's exit week {{in an interview with}} Inside Soap, saying that Tina would take over Stan's care when Mick and Shirley become too embroiled in arguing to notice the pain he is going through. Discussing Stan's death, Bradshaw-White said, [...] "Stan has another one of his episodes and Tina just falls apart. So {{the rest of the family}} end up sending her home - they think she's not going to be able to cope with him dying. Tina goes back to The Vic thinking that she'll come in and see her dad again in the morning, but then he tragically dies that night." [...] Stan's final scenes aired on 10 April 2015 when after an emotional heart-to-heart with Shirley, he peacefully died in a hospice. Rather than the regular [...] "Doof Doofs" [...] that feature at the end of each episode, Fly Me to the Moon, as sung by Tony Bennett, was played over the credits in tribute to Stan. Following his on-screen exit, West spoke out in support of Prostate Cancer UK and signed up for the Men United campaign, [...] "Stan was probably the archetypal bad patient. He was very slow in thinking about his condition and recognising what it might be. He was slow to seek diagnosis, slow to act on the diagnosis and reluctant to see doctors. He was terrible really, something we should all look at and not do the same. What Men United seeks to do, and it's terribly important, is to hold <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> people to say, 'Come on, you will see people here with whom you can swap experiences, swap ideas, swap thoughts, swap feelings'. You don't have to stand there and wait for people to come, because they won't. You just need a little push and you will like it when you get there." ...|$|E
60|$|I nodded approval. Mr. Corbeck jumped up, {{and in his}} {{impulsive}} way held <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> each.|$|E
60|$|Tallente held <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> each. For {{a moment}} the tragedy in his own life was forgotten.|$|E
60|$|She {{herself was}} {{too happy to}} notice the sudden fall in his countenance. Her piquant little face was beaming. She held <b>out</b> <b>a</b> pearl-gloved <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|Her {{expression}} had softened. [...] "I see." [...] She put <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> generously <b>to</b> ask forgiveness. [...] "I was presumptuous, and I had {{no right}} to speak as I did." ...|$|R
60|$|Clyffurde's winning glance, however, {{seemed to}} have conquered his mistrust, for presently, after he had put his mug down again, he {{stretched}} <b>out</b> <b>a</b> cordial <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R
60|$|The {{prisoner}} smiled calmly, as {{he reached}} <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> arrest the zealous movement of the simple Carmelite.|$|E
60|$|He {{stretched}} <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> pat {{me on the}} shoulder, {{then thought}} better of it and drew it back.|$|E
60|$|At the {{prospect}} of solitude, his fears seemed to crowd back upon him, and he stretched <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> detain him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor little Possums," [...] {{she hurried}} on, nodding {{her head and}} {{reaching}} <b>out</b> <b>a</b> caressing <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> where the fox terrier was ecstatically gnawing a deer-rib. A vicious snarl and a wicked snap that barely missed her fingers were her reward.|$|R
6000|$|Finally, having reached old {{age with}} its well-earned {{surroundings}} of [...] "honour, troops of friends," [...] {{the hero of}} my story bethought himself {{of those who were}} making a like start in life, and how he could stretch <b>out</b> <b>a</b> helping <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Acquit me of impertinent curiosity, my dear Mrs. Bounderby. I think Tom may be {{gradually}} {{falling into}} trouble, and I wish <b>to</b> stretch <b>out</b> <b>a</b> helping <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> {{him from the}} depths of my wicked experience. - Shall I say again, for his sake? Is that necessary?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And how {{the devil}} {{did he know}} where to find me!" [...] exclaimed the vice-admiral, holding <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> receive the communication.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right. We {{ought to}} be weeping because you didn't break it. Come, man, get up," [...] and he held <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> the {{prostrate}} rogue.|$|E
60|$|She {{studied his}} face gravely. When he held <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> her {{she clung to}} it desperately and a shudder again shook her from head to foot.|$|E
60|$|But he {{suffered}} as {{the blind man}} stretched <b>out</b> <b>a</b> strong, naked <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> him. Maurice accidentally knocked off Bertie's hat.|$|R
60|$|For once Josie hesitated, but {{realizing that}} {{hesitation}} meant weakness {{on such an}} errand she boldly thrust <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> and attempted <b>to</b> turn the doorknob.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Headway, without {{advancing}} <b>a</b> step, put <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> as if <b>to</b> draw her quickly closer. “I declare you’re too sweet!” Waterville {{heard her}} say.|$|R
6000|$|Jarman, {{stretching}} <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> me {{from the}} other side of Mrs. Peedles, urged me to cheer up. [...] "Don't wear your 'eart upon your sleeve," [...] he advised. [...] "Try and smile." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If it ain't Peter Tonsburg!" [...] Habert ejaculated, {{reaching}} <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> shake. [...] "Howdy, Peter, howdy. And {{where in}} {{hell are you}} hellbent for, surging by the Topila in such scandalous fashion!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] Mr. Harmer said; and {{preparing}} to take leave, {{he approached the}} door, near which they were standing. He stopped before them, and then, with a sudden impulse, held <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> each.|$|E
60|$|The angry Prince turned {{upon his}} heel and entered his tent once more, whilst Chandos, glancing round, held <b>out</b> <b>a</b> warm {{welcoming}} <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> Nigel.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{the first}} time Gilbert had said [...] "my wife" [...] to anybody but Anne, and he {{narrowly}} escaped bursting with the pride of it. The old captain held <b>out</b> <b>a</b> sinewy <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> Anne; they smiled at each other and were friends from that moment. Kindred spirit flashed recognition to kindred spirit.|$|R
60|$|Turning {{her face}} towards us, the girl {{held on to}} the stout cane, and swayed easily to and fro as we bumped over the rails. The Irishwoman's baby, a sickly little thing, was {{attracted}} by the flowers, and put <b>out</b> <b>a</b> small <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> touch them, with a wistful look at the bright face above.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Be {{careful what}} you say,' replied Nicholas. 'For Heaven's sake be careful! I am left here alone, and those who could stretch <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> rescue her are far away. What {{is it that you}} mean?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A lucky stab! Crane has a {{habit of}} running round like an ostrich and {{sticking}} <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> catch a ball. It's a grand-stand play. Why, a good outfielder would have been waiting under that fly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “A distant one; but {{my mother}} married a penniless army captain, and a ranker. He had won his {{commission}} by worth and valor, but that was no reason why the Pallisers should hold <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> him.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Make {{yourself}} at home, Morton!" [...] exclaimed Cecil, {{standing on the}} hearthrug and stretching <b>out</b> <b>a</b> numbed <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> the blaze. [...] "Draw an easy-chair up to the fire while James unpacks your traps and sees to your room. Leonard, ring the bell, there's a good fellow, {{and let them know}} we're ready for dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} help it, with the {{prospect}} of Lancey boy," [...] he said in smiling excuse, holding <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> in greeting <b>to</b> Gerald, and thanking Anna, who brought a cushion.|$|R
50|$|Willingness {{to serve}} {{those in need}} and a {{preferential}} {{option for the poor}} are the signs of a true disciple of Jesus Christ.
