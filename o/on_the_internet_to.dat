According to Jackson, the rivalry exists because he was one of the few fighters in Japan who was not afraid of Silva outside of the ring. Jackson stated that fighters were afraid to eat or be in an elevator with Silva, but he was not one of them. He added that the bad blood is only coming from Silva's end. Silva, on the other hand, cited Jackson's apparent insults towards him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> <b>to</b> account for the bad blood in an interview prior to the UFC 92 fight.|$|E

However, Tobey Grummet spoke highly {{of the program in}} anticipation of its release, and Mya was described by Elliot Drucker of Wireless Week as a solution to the limitations of accessing the Internet on a mobile phone, without a keyboard or large colour display. While regarding the program with interest, John Sullivan doubted that Mya would persuade people who were not already <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> start using it, and stated that if Mya could only read emails and not actually converse with him, he would rather just read his emails himself. Dawn Chmielewski from the Orange County Register called Mya a [...] "crude interpretation of things to come", noting that speech technology at the time was not without its limitations.|$|E
500|$|Two {{scenes in}} which Stewie {{graphically}} beats up Brian using a glass filled with orange juice, various household objects, and guns polarized people who viewed it. Several production members were offended. Cast members—as well as MacFarlane's mother and an animal rights advocate—enjoyed the scene; MacFarlane quoted his mother: [...] "I don't {{see what the}} problem is? He (Brian) owed him (Stewie) money!", {{and so it was}} kept in the final cut. When Lois gives the finger to the camera during the interview with Peter and Brady, her hand was blurred out on Fox airings of the episode. However, reruns on Adult Swim and TBS left the gesture intact. The gesture was also left intact on the DVD of [...] "Volume Four"; the production team enjoyed having this level of freedom. After the initial airing of the episode, where newscaster Tom Tucker announces a report on a fictional curse word, clemen, many viewers looked up the word <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> try to find a definition.
