5|$|As {{co-chair}} of the House Hunger Caucus, McGovern is an advocate for expanding child nutrition programs both domestically and internationally. In 2007 McGovern obtained $840 million in required funding for the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program in the House version of the farm bill. The House–Senate conference committee stripped most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funding</b> from the final bill.|$|E

5|$|On 1 May 2012 a 30,000 euro funding {{campaign}} was started to finance additional development projects. On {{the end of}} the year approximately 50% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funding</b> goal was achieved and it was decided to continue the funding campaign without deadlines. The money went to ReactOS Deutschland e.V.. As the tax law in Germany for this form of a registered voluntary association (Eingetragener Verein) makes it problematic to pay developers directly, indirect possibilities like stipends were evaluated.|$|E

5|$|The Jewish Quarter of Gaza was {{destroyed}} in the 1929 Palestine riots and most of Gaza's fifty Jewish families fled the city. In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion, with new neighborhoods, such as Rimal and Zeitoun being built along the coast, and the southern and eastern plains. Areas damaged in the riots also went through reconstruction. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funding</b> for these developments came from international organizations and missionary groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of women's football in Africa faces several challenges, including {{limited access to}} education, poverty amongst women, inequalities and human rights abuses. Many quality female footballers leave their home countries for better opportunities elsewhere. Another issue facing women's football is institutional. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funding</b> for the sport in Africa comes from FIFA, not from national football federations.|$|E
5|$|Albert Balink, a Dutch journalist, {{began work}} on {{what was to become}} Pareh in 1934. Unlike The Teng Chun, the inexperienced Balink chose to target his film at Dutch audiences. He brought in two of the Wong brothers, Chinese filmmakers who had been {{inactive}} since making Zuster Theresia (Sister Theresa) in 1932. The Wongs donated their studio– an old tapioca flour factory– as well as filmmaking equipment. Meanwhile, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funding</b> came from other backers. According to the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran, the money came from the cinema mogul Buse, while EYE Film Institute records indicate that the film was backed by the Centrale Commissie voor Emigratie en Kolonisatie van Inheemschen and meant to promote migration from Java to Sumatra.|$|E
50|$|Like {{personal}} pension schemes, stakeholder pensions {{must provide}} an income in retirement using a minimum <b>of</b> 75% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fund.</b> Up to 25% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> {{can be taken}} as a tax free lump sum.|$|R
50|$|Net {{asset value}} is most {{commonly}} used in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> open-end <b>funds.</b> Shares and interests in such funds are not traded between investors, but are issued by <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> to each new investor and redeemed by <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> when an investor withdraws. A fund will issue and redeem shares and interests at a price calculated by reference to <b>the</b> NAV <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fund,</b> with <b>the</b> intention that new investors receive a fair proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> and redeeming investors receive a fair proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fund's</b> value in cash.|$|R

5|$|Following the storm's damage, President George Bush {{declared}} five {{counties in}} Maine, seven counties in Massachusetts, and Rockingham County, New Hampshire to be disaster areas. The declaration {{allowed for the}} affected residents to apply for low-interest repair loans. New Jersey governor Jim Florio requested a declaration for portions of the coastline, but the request was denied because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funding</b> needs of other disasters, such as Hurricane Hugo, Hurricane Bob, and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The American Red Cross opened service centers in four locations in Massachusetts to assist the storm victims by providing food, clothing, medicine, and shelter. The agency deployed five vehicles carrying cleanup units and food, and allocated $1.4 million to provide assistance to 3,000 families.|$|E

5|$|Growing {{weary of}} his workload, Gray {{and his wife}} {{departed}} {{on a trip to}} Britain, Egypt (for three months), and Switzerland in September 1868. It was during the winter spent in Egypt that Gray first grew his white beard. They returned in autumn 1869. In early 1872 Gray tried to resign his professorship and garden duties still with no replacement for himself. He proposed only looking after the herbarium and writing books in exchange for the rent of the house in which he and his wife lived on the university grounds. Due to the way the finances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funding</b> sources were handled and the lack of a replacement, Gray was unable to resign at that time.|$|E
25|$|Salaries {{and other}} {{operating}} expenses are derived from premium payments and <b>the</b> income <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> under management.

5|$|In {{the months}} after the floods, the {{government}} of Yemen sought help from the International Development Association to prevent future floods from being as damaging. The government created an Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project that was geared toward more long term solutions. Thousands of farmers benefited from the improved irrigation and from the employment opportunities. Roads and bridges were rebuilt to a higher construction standard using local builders and contractors, the first such occurrence in the country using competitive bidding. The project was completed in December 2001 {{at a cost of}} US$31.59million; the International Development Association paid US$27.44million, and Yemen's government provided the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funding.</b>|$|E
5|$|The NAACP was {{responsible}} for managing most sit-in related cases that {{made it to the}} Supreme Court, winning nearly every decision. But it fell to the ACLU and other legal volunteer efforts to provide legal representation to hundreds of protestorswhite and blackwho were arrested while protesting in the South. The ACLU joined with other civil liberties groups to form the Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee (LCDC) which subsequently provided legal representation to many of the protesters. The ACLU provided the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funding</b> for the LCDC.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of women's football in Africa faces several challenges, including {{limited access to}} education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in that society that occasionally allows for female-specific human rights abuses. At the same time, if talented women footballers do emerge, many choose to go abroad to maximize playing opportunities. A lack of funding impedes regional {{development of}} women's football as most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funding</b> for the women's national team comes from FIFA, not the national football association.|$|E
50|$|Standard {{deviation}} is {{a measure}} <b>of</b> volatility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fund's</b> performance over a period <b>of</b> time. <b>The</b> higher the figure the greater <b>the</b> variability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fund's</b> performance. High historical volatility may indicate high future volatility, and therefore increased investment risk in a fund.|$|R
