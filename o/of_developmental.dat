The quantitative evolution <b>of</b> the <b>developmental</b> score <b>of</b> 16 features {{as a function}} <b>of</b> the <b>developmental</b> stage <b>of</b> the embryos (expressed in number of somites) is presented. Thirty-one groups of ten embryos, each with 0 to 30 somites, were scored for each feature according to the previous description of the authors. In addition, the variation of individual structures as a function <b>of</b> embryonic <b>developmental</b> stages is evaluated. It is suggested that the framework of differentiating individual structures at given developmental stages will help to plan experiments in <b>developmental</b> biology <b>of</b> rodents and will facilitate the interpretation <b>of</b> results in <b>developmental</b> toxicity...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of this}} bachelor thesis covers screening examination in pregnancy, screening <b>of</b> congenital <b>developmental</b> disorders {{in the first and}} second trimester and invasive methods for pre-natal diagnosis. Screening <b>of</b> congenial <b>developmental</b> disorders in the first trimester consists of use of biochemical markers and an ultrasound examination. Such a screening is called a combined test. The combined test is performed between the 11 th and the 14 th week of pregnancy. The screening in the first trimester is used to identify the risk of trisomy of chromosome 21 and trisomy of chromosome 18. The first goal has been {{to find out what the}} parents? expectations from the screening <b>of</b> congenital <b>developmental</b> disorders <b>of</b> a child in the first trimester are. The other goal of the thesis has been to find out whether parents are afraid of the results of the screening <b>of</b> congenital <b>developmental</b> disorders <b>of</b> a child in the first trimester. The research was conducted using a qualitative research by means of non-standardized interviews. The research set consisted of four couples being at the beginning of the first trimester and that did not have the screening <b>of</b> congenital <b>developmental</b> disorders in the first trimester yet. All responders have expected identification of a risk <b>of</b> congenital <b>developmental</b> disorders in the first trimester from the screening <b>of</b> congenital <b>developmental</b> disorders in the first trimester. All responders, both men and women, have found this screening very important; especially to make them sure the child is in good condition. The second research question has suggested that responders are afraid of the screening <b>of</b> congenital <b>developmental</b> disorders in the first trimester. One responder are not afraid of the results of the screening in the first trimester. This bachelor thesis can be used as a study material for students of a midwifery study programme and midwives at hospitals...|$|R

5|$|TBR1 was {{identified}} in 1995 by the Nina Ireland Laboratory <b>of</b> <b>Developmental</b> Neurobiology Center at the University of California, San Francisco. The gene, initially named TES-56, {{was found to}} be largely expressed in the telencephalic vesicles of the developing forebrain of mice. The protein product of TES-56 was discovered to be homologous to the Brachyury protein, a T-box transcription factor, which plays a role in establishing symmetry during embryonic development. Thus, due to its relation to T-box genes (such as Tbx-1, Tbx-2, Tbx-3), TES-56 was renamed TBR1.|$|E

Building on Locke's theory of the Association of Ideas, which he had outlined in Some Thoughts, philosopher David Hartley had developed an associationist psychology that greatly influenced writers such as Barbauld (who had read Joseph Priestley's redaction of it). For the first time, educational theorists and practitioners were thinking in terms <b>of</b> <b>developmental</b> psychology. As a result, Barbauld and the women writers she influenced produced the first graded texts and the first body of literature designed for an age-specific readership.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars mature {{through a}} series <b>of</b> <b>developmental</b> stages known as instars. Near {{the end of each}} stage, the larva {{undergoes}} a process called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of neurohormones. During this phase, the cuticle, a tough outer layer made of a mixture of chitin and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle. At the end of each instar, the larva moults, the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment. Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.|$|E

40|$|From {{clinical}} {{experiences and}} from research, {{it is known}} that the co-occurrence <b>of</b> a pervasive <b>developmental</b> disorder in mental retardation leads to many additional problems for children and their environment. Therefore, health and educational workers in the area of mental retardation should be aware <b>of</b> pervasive <b>developmental</b> disorders in this population, to enhance early identification and appropriate support. Three factors contribute to early identification and appropriate care. First, instruments are needed to measure pervasive developmental disorders in children and adolescents with mental retardation. Second, information on the prevalence <b>of</b> pervasive <b>developmental</b> disorders will increase the awareness of professionals on the occurrence of these disorders in this population. Third, insight into the additional and specific effects <b>of</b> pervasive <b>developmental</b> disorders on (mal) adaptive behavior of children and adolescents with mental retardation, will facilitate providing effective support. The objective {{of the present study was}} to contribute to the knowledge concerning the issues of identification <b>of</b> pervasive <b>developmental</b> disorders in children and adolescents with mental retardation, the prevalence and the relationship with (mal) adaptive behavior. ...|$|R

Epigenetic changes include modification of DNA by reversible methylation, as well as nonprogrammed remoulding of the organism by physical and other environmental effects due to the inherent plasticity <b>of</b> <b>developmental</b> mechanisms. The biologists Stuart A. Newman and Gerd B.

5|$|Screening for {{hypothyroidism}} {{is performed}} in the newborn period in many countries, generally using TSH.

While TSH-based screening will identify the most common causes, the addition of T4 testing is required to pick up the rarer central causes of neonatal hypothyroidism. If T4 determination is included in the screening done at birth, this will identify cases of congenital hypothyroidism of central origin in 1:16,000 to 1:160,000 children. Considering that these children usually have other pituitary hormone deficiencies, early identification of these cases may prevent complications.|$|E

40|$|In {{light of}} the growing {{consensus}} surrounding {{the need for the}} emergence <b>of</b> Democratic <b>Developmental</b> States in Africa, this thesis analyses the concept within the context of two Southern African states: Botswana and South Africa. In this regard, it critically analyses the extent to which Botswana and South Africa can be considered to be Democratic Developmental States by making use five benchmarks <b>of</b> a Democratic <b>Developmental</b> State. It does so by firstly exploring and defining the concept and theory <b>of</b> the <b>Developmental</b> State as well as the concept <b>of</b> the Democratic <b>Developmental</b> State. Secondly, the thesis surveys the contributions made by five key authors, namely, Richard Sklar, Adrian Leftwich, Mark Robinson, Gordon White and Omano Edigheji, to the topic <b>of</b> the Democratic <b>Developmental</b> State and outlines the following five benchmarks <b>of</b> a Democratic <b>Developmental</b> State: Development-Oriented Political Leadership; Effective and Well-Insulated Economic Bureaucracy; Developmental Success; Consolidated Electoral Democracy; and Popular Participation in the Development and Governance Process. Thirdly, the five benchmarks are used to critically analyse whether Botswana and South Africa can truly be regarded as Democratic Developmental States. In this regard, the thesis finds that neither state fully exhibits all five outlined benchmarks <b>of</b> a Democratic <b>Developmental</b> State: While Botswana exemplifies most of the five outlined benchmarks <b>of</b> a Democratic <b>Developmental</b> State, this thesis finds that South Africa still has a long to go before it can be regarded as a Democratic Developmental State. In this manner, this thesis provides possible recommendations which will assist both Botswana and South Africa towards becoming fully-fledged Democratic Developmental States...|$|R
