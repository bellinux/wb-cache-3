5|$|Community {{opposition}} did exist, {{mainly from}} residents of Ahwatukee. While the Maricopa Association <b>of</b> <b>Governments</b> had considered building a limited access parkway or arterials along the South Mountain Freeway's proposed route, the eight-lane freeway concept ultimately was {{pushed by the}} region's planners to meet the traffic needs at close to the same cost. For most of 2010, the Gila River Indian Community, Maricopa Association <b>of</b> <b>Governments,</b> City of Phoenix, ADOT and others discussed movement of the alignment to tribal land, but no agreements were reached.|$|E

5|$|According to Hepburn (2006, pp.238–239), “it {{should be}} {{expected}} that industry will lobby furiously against any auctioning.” Hepburn et al. (2006) state {{that it is an}} empirical fact that while businesses tend to oppose auctioning of emissions permits, economists almost uniformly recommend auctioning permits. Garnaut notes that the complexity of free allocation, and the large amounts of money involved, encourage non-productive rent-seeking behaviour and lobbying <b>of</b> <b>governments,</b> activities that dissipate economic value.|$|E

5|$|Skeptics, who {{adhere to}} the psychosocial {{hypothesis}} for unidentified flying objects, argue that the convergence of New World Order conspiracy theory and UFO conspiracy theory {{is a product of}} not only the era's widespread mistrust <b>of</b> <b>governments</b> and the popularity of the extraterrestrial hypothesis for UFOs but of the far right and ufologists actually joining forces. Barkun notes that the only positive side to this development is that, if conspirators plotting to rule the world are believed to be aliens, traditional human scapegoats (Freemasons, Illuminati, Jews, etc.) are downgraded or exonerated.|$|E

For SR 198, the plan is to extend the freeway segment from Naval Air Station Lemoore to I-5.

40|$|Theories <b>of</b> <b>government</b> {{spending}} {{driven by}} a common-pool problem in the fiscal revenues pool predict that greater districting of a political jurisdiction raises the scale <b>of</b> <b>government.</b> This paper presents evidence on this and related predictions from a cross section <b>of</b> city <b>governments</b> in the United States. The main finding is that, when other plausible determinants <b>of</b> <b>government</b> spending are controlled for, greater districting leads to a considerably greater scale <b>of</b> <b>government</b> activity. The results also show that at-large electoral systems do not, and forms <b>of</b> <b>government</b> that concentrate powers {{in the office of}} the executive do, break this relationship. ...|$|R
5|$|Al-Qaeda {{confirmed}} the death on May 6 with posts made on militant websites, vowing to avenge the killing. Other Pakistani militant groups, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, vowed retaliation against the U.S. and against Pakistan for not preventing the operation. The raid {{was supported by}} over 90% of the American public, was welcomed by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union {{and a large number}} <b>of</b> <b>governments,</b> but was condemned by others, including two-thirds of the Pakistani public. Legal and ethical aspects of the killing, such as his not being taken alive despite being unarmed, were questioned by others, including Amnesty International. Also controversial was the decision not to release any photographic or DNA evidence of bin Laden's death to the public.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{question}} of who would represent the Earth as a whole, contact could create other international problems, such as the degree of involvement <b>of</b> <b>governments</b> foreign to the one whose radio astronomers received the signal. The United Nations discussed various issues of foreign relations immediately before the launch of the Voyager probes, which in 2012 left the Solar System carrying a golden record in case they are found by extraterrestrial intelligence. Among the issues discussed were what messages would best represent humanity, what format they should take, how to convey the cultural history of the Earth, and what international groups should be formed to study extraterrestrial intelligence in greater detail.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, the Southeastern Connecticut Council <b>of</b> <b>Governments</b> (SCCOG) began a {{study of}} how to improve the Regional Intermodal Transportation Center (RITC), {{including}} Union Station. The study analyzed problems with the RITC – including poor pedestrian connections, minimal bus facilities, {{and a lack of}} food vendors – and considered but rejected a move to a Fort Trumbull site. The proposed alternative released in 2010, which would cost around $20 million, would relocate Water Street slightly to the west. The bus terminal would be expanded, with a new building adding onto the existing former baggage office. A pedestrian bridge was to be constructed connecting the Water Street Garage, the main station area, the northbound Amtrak platform, and the ferry terminal – a design that served station passengers as well as the ferries. Other pedestrian improvements were to include wayfinding signs, pedestrian-scale lighting, and expanded sidewalks.|$|E
5|$|In July 1999, the Communist Party {{initiated}} {{a campaign to}} persecute Falun Gong, including {{through the use of}} extralegal imprisonment, torture and other coercive measures, and propaganda.

These tactics range from engagement with the media, lobbying <b>of</b> <b>governments</b> and NGOs, public protests and demonstrations, and attempts to seek legal redress. As the persecution in China progressed, overseas Falun Gong efforts increasingly tied their pleas for relief to Western human rights discourse, emphasizing the implications for freedom of speech, assembly, and conscience.|$|E
