5|$|This {{measure of}} {{elasticity}} is {{sometimes referred to}} as the own-price elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> a good, i.e., the elasticity of demand with respect to the good's own price, in order to distinguish it from the elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> that good with respect to the change in the price of some other good, i.e., a complementary or substitute good. The latter type of elasticity measure is called a cross-price elasticity of demand.|$|E
5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> a good is relatively inelastic (-1 < Ed < 0), the percentage change in quantity demanded {{is smaller than}} that in price. Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue increases, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> a good is unit (or unitary) elastic (Ed = -1), the percentage change in quantity demanded {{is equal to}} that in price, so a change in price will not affect total revenue.|$|E

5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> a good is perfectly elastic (Ed is − ∞), {{any increase in}} the price, no matter how small, will cause the quantity demanded for the good to drop to zero. Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue falls to zero. This situation is typical for goods that have their value defined by law (such as fiat currency); if a 5 dollar bill were sold for anything more than 5 dollars, nobody would buy it, so demand is zero.|$|E

He signed up with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) for whom he appeared in a wide range of shows and also in his own one-man engagements. He would sometimes turn up unannounced to perform at hospitals, munition factories, airfields, anti-aircraft posts and other venues where there was an audience of just a few people.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the rebound}} effect is {{determined}} by the price elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> the good. In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is price elastic), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.|$|E

5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), {{changes in the}} price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person {{will be willing to}} pay anything for a good if the alternative is death. For example, a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, no matter how much, for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s and 1860s, {{the quality}} of the ponies was noted to be declining, a result of poor choice of {{breeding}} stallions, and the introduction of Arab to improve the breed was recommended. The census of stock of 1875 reported just under three thousand ponies grazing the Forest, and by 1884 the number had dropped to 2,250. Profits from the sale of young ponies affected the number of mares that commoners bred in subsequent years. The drop in numbers on the Forest may have been a consequence of introducing Arab blood to the breed in the 1870s, resulting in fewer animals suitable for use as pit ponies, or to the increase in the profits from running dairy cattle instead of ponies. The Arab blood may have reduced the ponies' natural landrace hardiness to thrive on the open Forest over winter. Numbers of ponies on the Forest also declined as a result <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> more refined-looking ponies for riding and driving work prior to the introduction of motor vehicles. Later, the Second World War drove up the demand for, and thus, the market value of, young animals for horse meat.|$|E
