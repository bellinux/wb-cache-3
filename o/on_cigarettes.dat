Having adopted a pay-as-you-go {{program for the}} state, {{he was forced to}} raise additional revenue after the war ended.

5|$|During the General Assembly's 2005 session, Fletcher again {{proposed}} his {{tax reform}} plan, and {{late in the}} session, both houses passed it. The plan raised sin taxes <b>on</b> <b>cigarettes</b> and alcohol, as well as upping taxes on satellite television service and motel rooms. Businesses were also subjected to a gross receipts tax. In exchange, corporate taxes were lowered, as were income taxes for individuals who earned less than $75,000 annually; 300,000 low-wage earners were dropped from the income tax rolls altogether. The Assembly also passed a budget {{for the remainder of}} the biennium, abolished the state's public campaign finance laws, and passed new school nutrition guidelines.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} tested a model {{examining}} both {{the direct and}} mediated effects of Ethnic Cultural Norms (ECN) <b>on</b> <b>cigarette</b> use {{in a sample of}} Mexican American youth (ages 11 – 14; N= 921). Contextual risk factors (peer smoking and family smoking) were included as potential moderators of this mediational relationship. A product of coefficient (ab) method to test the significance of the mediated effect [Evaluation Review 17 (1993) 144. ] was adapted to assess the mediation of interaction effects. Results suggested that Tobacco Avoidance Self-Efficacy mediated the protective influence of ECN <b>on</b> <b>cigarette</b> use. However, as peer smoking increased, the influence of ECN <b>on</b> <b>cigarette</b> use diminished, though it remained a significant, protective influence <b>on</b> <b>cigarette</b> use.

Beshear announced that his proposal for a constitutional amendment to allow for casinos was dead for the regular session on March 27, 2008. Among the other proposals favored by Beshear that failed to pass in the session were an ethics reform measure Beshear proposed {{in the wake of the}} investigation of the Fletcher administration, a plan to reduce the projected shortfall in the state's pension system, and a proposed 70-cent-per-pack tax increase <b>on</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> Besides the state budget, major legislation passed during the session included incentives for homeowners and businesses to utilize energy efficiency measures, anti-bullying legislation, and increased penalties for animal cruelty.|$|E
5|$|In Pennsylvania, washed-out {{rail lines}} {{prevented}} operation along the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad for several weeks, and lines reopened after about two months. The expense of reopening, {{and the loss}} of being closed, led to the railroad merging with the Erie Railroad to become the Erie Lackawanna Railway in 1960. One stranded train along the line prompted a helicopter to rescue 235people. Flooding along the Lehigh River destroyed 15industrial plants, which left more than 15,000people near Allentown, Pennsylvania without work temporarily. The mayor of Scranton {{declared a state of emergency}} due to the floods, ordering all businesses to close. United States Army soldiers provided water to residents after the town lost its water supply. Elsewhere, the Pennsylvania National Guard was on duty on streets in damaged towns, including 50 to prevent looting in Upper Black Eddy, which was one of the hardest hit towns. Helicopters assisted in discovering bodies at Camp Davis, where many deaths occurred during the storm. Statewide, thousands of people were left homeless. In Stroudsburg, there was a food shortage, and officials enacted a curfew, after reports of looting. In the same city, water was shipped in milk cartons to the flood victims, which later inspired a Federal Civil Defense Administration proposal to use water packaged in milk containers in the event of a nuclear attack. The state government implemented a tax <b>on</b> <b>cigarettes</b> to help pay for storm damage, which lasted for about two years; this was partially due to a lack of significant funding from the federal government. Pennsylvania also enacted an increase in the gasoline tax that was later made permanent to pay for the Interstate Highway System. The two taxes, each an increase of 1penny, totaled $71million, a part of which was set aside for future disasters. The experience of the storm's aftermath provided the basis for the aftermath for Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In New Jersey, Governor Robert B. Meyner declared the floods as at the time the state's worst natural disaster.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{biological}} effects, smoking has {{a profound}} social impact on people with schizophrenia. One major impact is financial, as people with schizophrenia {{have been found}} to spend a disproportionate amount of their income <b>on</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> A study of people with schizophrenia on public assistance found that they spent a median amount of $142 per month <b>on</b> <b>cigarettes</b> out of a median monthly public assistance income of $596, or about 27.36%. Some argue that this results in further social impacts as people with schizophrenia are then unable to spend money on entertainment and social events that would promote well-being, or may even be unable to afford housing or nutrition.|$|E

25|$|Malta {{has used}} excise stamps {{to pay for}} the tax <b>on</b> <b>cigarettes</b> since at least the 1930s. Early issues {{consisted}} of long strips which depicted the British coat of arms and were inscribed EXCISE DUTY in English and DAZJU in Maltese. A smaller design was issued for imported cigarettes. Long strips with a plain design without any ornamentation were introduced in the 1950s, while designs depicting a mural crown and a Maltese cross were issued after independence in 1964.|$|E
25|$|Since the Second Uniform Tax Case, {{a number}} of other {{political}} and legal decisions have centralised fiscal power with the Commonwealth. In Ha vs. New South Wales (1997), the High Court found that the Business Franchise Licences (Tobacco) Act 1987 (NSW) was invalid because it levied a customs duty, a power exercisable only by the Commonwealth (s.90). This decision effectively invalidated state taxes <b>on</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> alcohol and petrol. Similarly, the imposition of a Commonwealth goods and services tax (GST) in 2000 transferred another revenue base to the Commonwealth.|$|E

Malta also had specific stamps for the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance (1929–56), passport fees (1933–72), National Insurance (1956–76) and Airport Charge (1975–88). Excise stamps {{have been used to}} pay the tax <b>on</b> <b>cigarettes</b> since the 1930s, the tax on spirits since the 2000s, and the tax on wine since 2015.

25|$|Health psychologists {{promote health}} through {{behavioral}} change, as mentioned above; however, {{they attempt to}} prevent illness in other ways as well. Health psychologists try to help people to lead a healthy life by developing and running programmes which can help people {{to make changes in}} their lives such as stopping smoking, reducing the amount of alcohol they consume, eating more healthily, and exercising regularly. Campaigns informed by health psychology have targeted tobacco use. Those least able to afford tobacco products consume them most. Tobacco provides individuals with a way of controlling aversive emotional states accompanying daily experiences of stress that characterize the lives of deprived and vulnerable individuals. Practitioners emphasize education and effective communication as a part of illness prevention because many people do not recognize, or minimize, the risk of illness present in their lives. Moreover, many individuals are often unable to apply their knowledge of health practices owing to everyday pressures and stresses. A common example of population-based attempts to motivate the smoking public to reduce its dependence <b>on</b> <b>cigarettes</b> is anti-smoking campaigns.|$|E

Appropriating over $60 {{billion over}} 5 years by {{matching}} {{federal funds to}} states that provide health insurance to children and pregnant women, and raising the federal cigarette tax from 39 cents to $1. After CHIP passed the House and the Senate, President George W. Bush vetoed the bill over a $30 billion spending difference between what he and congress proposed, saying that “Because the Congress has chosen to send me a bill that moves {{our health care system}} in the wrong direction, I must veto it,” and that lawmakers should “produce a good bill that puts poorer children first.” After Bush's decision on CHIP, Donnelly joined 217 Democrats and 42 Republicans in a failed measure to override Bush's veto. In 2009 after Bush left office, the House passed a new version of CHIP, and President Barack Obama signed it into law. The new version including the original expansion of coverage to 4 million children, and along with raising taxes <b>on</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> a new provision was added to raise taxes on other tobacco products.|$|E
