40|$|The {{conceptual}} understandings <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> mineral were examined for first-year {{junior high school}} students by analyzing concept maps, a test on <b>rock</b> names <b>and</b> a questionnaire on <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> mineral. Their understandings <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> mineral were categorized into four groups defined by correct and incorrect understandings of the material <b>and</b> terminological structures <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> mineral. The students of the group defined by correct understanding of the material structure and incorrect understanding of the terminological structure think the terminological structure <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> mineral as same as the material structure. Because minerals are materially included in rocks, they regard minerals as a sort <b>of</b> <b>rocks.</b> This misconception was possibly acquired through the lesson on the material structure <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> mineral. For correct understanding <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> mineral, students have to learn both the material <b>and</b> terminological structures <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> mineral. 中学 1 年生の岩石・鉱物の理解の仕方を岩石名調査，コンセプトマップ調査及びアンケート調査により調べた．その結果，生徒たちの岩石・鉱物に対する理解は，岩石・鉱物の物質的な構造の理解・不理解とそれらの用語の構造の理解・不理解の組み合わせで定義される四つのグループの中に位置づけられることが分かった．そして，そのうち，岩石・鉱物の物質的な構造の理解と用語の構造の不理解で定義されるグループに属する生徒の多くは，用語の構造を物質的な構造と同様に理解していることが分かった．そのような理解は岩石と鉱物の物質的な構造の学習により強化されたものと考えられる．学習者が岩石と鉱物を正しく理解するため，岩石と鉱物を混同しないためには，物質的な構造の学習のみでは不十分であり，岩石と鉱物の用語の構造の学習を伴わなければならない...|$|R

5|$|Carolyn Porco of NASA was {{consulted}} on {{the planetary}} science and imagery. The animators realistically recreated what an explosion {{would look like}} in space: short blasts, which suck inward and leave debris from a ship floating. For shots of an imploding planet, the same explosion program was used to simulate it breaking up, while the animators could manually composite multiple layers <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> <b>and</b> wind sucking into the planet. Unlike other Star Trek films and series, the transporter beam effects swirl rather than speckle. Abrams conceived the redesign to emphasize the notion of transporters as beams that can pick up and move people, rather than a signal composed of scrambled atoms.|$|E

5|$|The {{protoplanetary disk}} is an {{accretion}} disk that feeds the central star. Initially very hot, the disk later cools {{in what is}} known as the T tauri star stage; here, formation of small dust grains made <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> <b>and</b> ice is possible. The grains eventually may coagulate into kilometer-sized planetesimals. If the disk is massive enough, the runaway accretions begin, resulting in the rapid—100,000 to 300,000years—formation of Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Near the star, the planetary embryos go through a stage of violent mergers, producing a few terrestrial planets. The last stage takes approximately 100million to a billion years.|$|E
5|$|Eastern South Dakota {{generally}} features higher precipitation {{and lower}} topography than {{the western part}} of the state. Smaller geographic regions of this area include the Coteau des Prairies, the Dissected Till Plains, and the James River Valley. The Coteau des Prairies is a plateau bordered on the east by the Minnesota River Valley and on the west by the James River Basin. Further west, the James River Basin is mostly low, flat, highly eroded land, following the flow of the James River through South Dakota from north to south. The Dissected Till Plains, an area of rolling hills and fertile soil that covers much of Iowa and Nebraska, extends into the southeastern corner of South Dakota. Layers deposited during the Pleistocene epoch, starting around two million years ago, cover most of eastern South Dakota. These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state, the product of several successive periods of glaciation which deposited a large amount <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> <b>and</b> soil, known as till, over the area.|$|E
5|$|Seventy-three bais, or forest clearings, {{have been}} {{discovered}} in Nki National Park. In April 2006, while looking for elephant groups, a WWF team discovered the largest bai in the region, Ikwa Bai. Dr. Mike Loomis, {{a member of the}} group, confirmed that this bai is slightly larger than Dzanga Sangha Bai (Central African Republic), which had previously held the record. He also reported little human development adjacent to the bai, and noticed 21 elephants and 16 buffaloes in it simultaneously. The bai has a small creek running through its center, which sits atop a bed <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> <b>and</b> sand. A large mineral pit is located next to the stream. It is the habitat of several wildlife species, the largest-numbering being chimpanzees, elephants, buffaloes, and gorillas.|$|E

He also made a careful study of the foreshore, assessing its potential as a site where a future expedition might land and establish winter quarters. When Antarctic reached Melbourne, Bull and Borchgrevink left the ship. Each hoped to raise funds for a further Antarctic expedition, but their efforts were unsuccessful. An animosity developed between them, possibly because of their differing accounts of the voyage on the Antarctic; each emphasised his own role without fully acknowledging that of the other.|$|E
5|$|Bears, {{both black}} and brown, are seen in Glacier Bay in the {{intertidal}} zone which they frequent for foraging. They are also seen “scraping barnacles off <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> <b>and</b> munching mussels.” Invariably they are spotted wandering alone along the beaches of the Glacier Bay in search of salmon. The habitats of the black bears are generally the southern forested areas of the bay. However, the brown bears are mostly found in the northern, more recently glaciated zones of the Glacier Bay. Occasionally, black bears are sighted near the glaciers or near Gustavus town. Black bears with black dots and brown bears with brown dots have been {{seen over the last}} 10 years. Their travel routes have been identified as along the easy tracks such as along beaches, stream beds and river valleys. The most commonly identified locations for sighting bears in the Glacier Bay are: The Bartlett Cove, the Bartlett River, the Beardslee Islands and North and South Sandy Cove locations for black bears, while brown bears are seen to the north of Tidal Inlet in the west arm of glacier and north of Adams Inlet in the east arm. They are also seen swimming in the Bay, crossing from one bank to the other. Salmon are their favorite food, apart from bumblebees, sand fleas, bird eggs, birds, voles and marine mammal carcasses.|$|E
5|$|The further {{evolution}} of Callisto after accretion {{was determined by}} the balance of the radioactive heating, cooling through thermal conduction near the surface, and solid state or subsolidus convection in the interior. Details of the subsolidus convection in the ice is the main source of uncertainty in the models of all icy moons. It is known to develop when the temperature is sufficiently close to the melting point, due to the temperature dependence of ice viscosity. Subsolidus convection in icy bodies is a slow process with ice motions of the order of 1centimeter per year, but is, in fact, a very effective cooling mechanism on long timescales. It is thought to proceed in the so-called stagnant lid regime, where a stiff, cold outer layer of Callisto conducts heat without convection, whereas the ice beneath it convects in the subsolidus regime. For Callisto, the outer conductive layer corresponds to the cold and rigid lithosphere with a thickness of about 100km. Its presence would explain the lack of any signs of the endogenic activity on the Callistoan surface. The convection in the interior parts of Callisto may be layered, because under the high pressures found there, water ice exists in different crystalline phases beginning from the ice I on the surface to ice VII in the center. The early onset of subsolidus convection in the Callistoan interior could have prevented large-scale ice melting and any resulting differentiation that would have otherwise formed a large rocky core and icy mantle. Due to the convection process, however, very slow and partial separation and differentiation <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> <b>and</b> ices inside Callisto has been proceeding on timescales of billions of years and may be continuing to this day.|$|E
