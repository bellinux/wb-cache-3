5|$|This pyramid was {{the last}} pyramid ever built {{as part of a}} {{mortuary}} complex in Egypt. The pyramid would be abandoned by subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom, for both practical and religious reasons. The Giza plateau offered plenty <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> building pyramids; but {{this was not the case}} with the confined, cliff-bound geography of Thebes and any burials in the surrounding desert were vulnerable to flooding. The pyramid form was associated with the sun god Re, who had been overshadowed by Amun in importance. One of the meanings of Amun's name was the hidden one, which meant that it was now theologically permissible to hide the Pharaoh's tomb by fully separating the mortuary template from the actual burial place. This provided the added advantage that the resting place of the pharaoh could be kept hidden from necropolis robbers. All subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom would be buried in rock-cut shaft tombs in the Valley of the Kings.|$|E

25|$|In response, Deng Xiaoping cited {{clearly the}} lack <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> {{compromise}} {{on the question}} of sovereignty over Hong Kong; the PRC, as the successor of Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China on the mainland, would recover the entirety of the New Territories, Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. China considered treaties about Hong Kong as unequal and ultimately refused to accept any outcome that would indicate permanent loss of sovereignty over Hong Kong's area, whatever wording the former treaties had.|$|E
25|$|The {{best known}} case of {{possible}} homosexuality in ancient Egypt {{is that of}} the two high officials Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep. Both men lived and served under pharaoh Niuserre during the 5th Dynasty (c. 24942345 BC). Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep each had families of their own with children and wives, but when they died their families apparently decided to bury them together in one and the same mastaba tomb. In this mastaba, several paintings depict both men embracing each other and touching their faces nose-on-nose. These depictions leave plenty <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> speculation, because in ancient Egypt the nose-on-nose touching normally represented a kiss.|$|E

25|$|The school {{never really}} had a {{permanent}} location until 1905, when a building was erected at the present site of Saint John Paul II High School. In 1930, the building was rebuilt. The building was renovated in 1939, due to the increase of students. Unfortunately, the building was already three stories tall in the 1950s and {{there was very little}} room with which the building could use for expansion. This also was complicated by a lack <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> athletic fields, which included McKeon Field and a football/soccer field. It was decided that a new school should be built using land willed to the town by Enoch Cobb.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} weaponry, the Tenryū class was weaker {{than any other}} {{contemporary}} cruiser. The main battery consisted of four 14 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns, which were also utilized as the secondary battery on the s. However, the guns were situated in single mounts on the centerline, with only a limited angle of fire, and could fire only one gun at a target immediately in front or aft of the vessel. A further weakness was the lack <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> anti-aircraft guns. Despite awareness increasing about the growing threat of aircraft to surface ships, the secondary battery of the Tenryū class consisted of only a single dual-purpose 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval guns, plus two 6.5mm machine guns. The class also {{was the first to}} use triple torpedo launchers, with two centerline-mounted Type 6 21-inch launchers. No reloads were carried.|$|E
25|$|In 1912, {{the school}} {{moved to a}} new {{location}} on the corner of Bayview Terrace, near the tram terminus, needing more room. Even with the new land, due to space constraints sporting activities were out of the question, so for many years the boys walked to the nearby Kalinga Park. In 1908, there were 80 students and a cadet corps was formed with the impending 1914–1918 war. The school suffered the losses of eight Clayfield Collegians during the war. In the late 1920s the school was moved, again due to a lack <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> new facilities, to its current site in Toowong with support from its owners, the daughters of the late Premier of Queensland, Sir Robert Philp. The Clayfield campus became a primary school department of Somerville House, which later developed into the independent Clayfield College.|$|E

25|$|Griffith Stadium hosted {{numerous}} football events {{before the}} Redskins moved there in 1937. It {{was the home}} of Georgetown Hoyas football from 1921 until 1950, George Washington Colonials football in the 1930s and 1940s, and Maryland Terrapins football in 1948. The stadium was the host of an annual Thanksgiving Day game between Howard and Lincoln Universities, {{which was one of}} the most popular events during the year, drawing many African American alumni and fans from the surrounding neighborhoods. One major reason for the stadium's early-1920s expansion was that Clark Griffith had envisioned the stadium hosting the annual Army–Navy football game, played every December. Temporary seats were often placed in right field for football games at Griffith, with the gridiron stretching from left field to the first base line. The exceptional distance from home to the left-field area allowed plenty <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> the football field.|$|E
25|$|Other castles {{begun in}} the 11th century were built on {{elevated}} sites that {{took advantage of the}} steep slopes for defense, rather than on moats. The central tower became the final defensive layer of the castle, while the main domestic quarters were built against the walls around the perimeter, allowing plenty <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> a variety of functions. Conisborough Castle is an English example, with the shell keep rising on the earlier motte, and a wall with the residential and service quarters built into it, enclosing the bailey. The ruins within the bailey show remains of a great hall with central fireplace, a kitchen and a two storeyed residential block with adjacent latrines. The keep itself contains a room for the lord, complete with a hooded fireplace, while a small vaulted chapel was built into the thick outer wall of the keep. Ludlow Castle, Shropshire {{begun in the}} 11th century, was lived in by a number of members of the Tudor royal family and had both its fortifications and living quarters improved over several centuries.|$|E
25|$|At 1:50 pm, {{the troops}} of A/27/9 AIB {{set out for}} the town. Thirty minutes later, Engemen led the 17 tanks of A/14/9 AIB forward. The troops and tanks arrived {{at about the same time}} and {{advanced}} quickly through Remagen against light resistance. The Germans relied for local defense on Volksturm, citizens who were conscripted close to their homes in the belief that they would defend their towns and villages. German defensive policy did not include planning for defending rear areas in depth. There were no antitank ditches or mines, barbed wire, or trenches on the route to Remagen. The few defensive obstacles that had been constructed were too weak to block tanks or had been placed in open terrain, and the roadblocks they had built usually allowed plenty <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> vehicles to pass. The only defense that slowed the Americans down was a machine gun manned by infantry over the town square, which two of the Pershings quickly dispatched. Relatively unmolested, the Americans arrived in strength at the western end of the bridge and the tanks began covering the bridge and the east shore with tank rounds, destroying a locomotive attached to a string of freight cars on the rail line parallel to the river.|$|E

Kingsley wrote to the poet Philip Larkin in April 1969: [...] "This is a bloody great mansion, {{in the depths of}} the country though only 15 miles from the centre, and with lots <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> you to come and spend the night." ...|$|E

[...] However, he wrote that the episode [...] "includes a few goods bits, {{especially}} the phone call in which Homer convinces Lenny {{to go to the}} game." [...] Jake McNeill of Digital Entertainment News wrote that the episode is [...] "so jam-packed with guest celebrity voices that they ran out <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> a plot. Or humor." [...] Chris Barsanti of Filmcritic.com gave a negative review as well, and wrote that the episode is [...] "lost amid a flurry of celebrity walk-ons and lazy jokes." ...|$|E

500|$|Shau {{enjoyed the}} game's presentation, praising {{the music and}} visuals, but wished {{that there had been}} a larger visual variety for the levels. Joynt, however, found the {{graphics}} unimpressive, while noting that they were unimportant compared to the gameplay. DeVries thought the animations were underwhelming for a Super Famicom game, noting situations such as lighting undead soldiers on fire as examples of when further visual spectacle would have added to the experience. Gann said that the graphics were [...] "simple and functional" [...] and, while improved in the Nintendo DS version, still had plenty <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> improvement; he also wished that there had been character art accompanying the dialogue boxes, and more cutscenes. He called the music and sound effects excellent, calling the sound impressive and fitting, causing him to start searching for all soundtrack releases from the Mystery Dungeon series.|$|E
500|$|Pint-sized pop diva Kylie Minogue's {{continued}} crossover from lightweight pop puppet to respected artist {{continued with}} the release of this, a compilation of remixed singles from the Impossible Princess album.

500|$|Harrison viewed Wonderwall at Twickenham Film Studios with Massot and was {{intrigued}} by the storyline. The film's premise concerns a lonely professor (played by Irish actor Jack MacGowran) and his increasing obsession with his female neighbour, a fashion model named Penny Lane (played by Jane Birkin), whose life he spies on via {{a hole in the}} wall separating their apartments. In the context of 1960s Swinging London, the contrast between their existences symbolised the division between traditional norms and the younger generation's progressive thinking. In his soundtrack for the film, Harrison conveyed this contrast further in terms of the duality between psychedelia and his Hindu-aligned spiritual convictions. According to author Simon Leng: [...] "The lack of dialogue left acres <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> music to speak, and a soupçon of cosmic apotheosis also helped ... Wonderwall touched on themes that would come to preoccupy George Harrison – critically, the objectification of celebrities and the shallowness of fame." ...|$|E
