25|$|UC Irvine is {{the last}} UC campus that {{subcontracts}} its food services.

25|$|The island's {{traditional}} {{economy was}} based around sugarcane plantations. By {{the middle of}} the twentieth century it remained one of the poorest in the Caribbean. In 1947 newly elected Puerto Rican governor Luis Muñoz Marín of the Popular Democratic Party along with the United States government began Operation Bootstrap, which invested millions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>into</b> the Puerto Rican to industrialize the island's economy. Based on 1930s New Deal economic relief reforms and infrastructure provided by the programs such as the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration, Operation Bootstrap intended to move Puerto Rico away from its agrarian system and into an industrial economy. The government's Administration of Economic Development —today known as the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company (PRIDCO)— encouraged the establishment of factories.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a recent}} {{movement}} to reestablish manufacturing {{activities in the}} United States driven by customer demand for American made products, faster product delivery, increased overseas wages, and inflated costs of shipping {{has led to a}} sizeable increase in the local manufacturing base and rapidly growing interest in the region. Few other areas in the country are able to offer such comparatively low costs of living and doing business, including low energy costs, tax incentives and overnight distribution access to more than one-third the total population of the United States. Several large manufacturing companies from countries such as China and Germany have already invested tens of millions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>into</b> establishing significant operations in the Lehigh Valley with the potential to create thousands of new local jobs in this sector.|$|E
25|$|Since January 2002, the {{exchange}} rate fluctuated, up to a peak of four pesos to one dollar (that is, a 75% devaluation). The resulting export boom produced a massive inflow <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>into</b> the Argentine economy, which helped lower their price. For a time the administration stated and maintained a strategy of keeping {{the exchange}} rate at between 2.90 and 3.10 pesos per US dollar, {{in order to maintain}} the competitiveness of exports and encourage import substitution by local industries. When necessary, the Central Bank issues pesos and buys dollars in the free market (sometimes large amounts, in the order of 10 to US$100 million per day) to keep the dollar price from dropping, and had amassed over US$27 billion in reserves before the US$9.81 billion payment to the International Monetary Fund in January 2006.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{concerns}} about America's rapidly deteriorating payments situation and massive flight of liquid capital from the U.S., President Richard Nixon suspended the convertibility <b>of</b> the <b>dollar</b> <b>into</b> gold on 15 August 1971. In December 1971, the Smithsonian Agreement {{paved the way}} for the increase in the value <b>of</b> the <b>dollar</b> price <b>of</b> gold from US$35.50 to US$38 an ounce. Speculation against the dollar in March 1973 led to the birth of the independent float, thus effectively terminating the Bretton Woods system.|$|R

The county was forced to borrow $1 billion.|$|R
25|$|Jackson, however, {{managed to}} {{successfully}} portray his veto {{as a defense}} of the common man against governmental tyranny. Clay proved to be no match to Jackson's ability to resonate with {{the people and the}} Democratic Party's strong political networks. Democratic newspapers, parades, barbecues, and rallies increased Jackson's popularity. At Biddle's direction, the Bank poured thousands <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>into</b> a campaign to defeat Jackson, seemingly confirming Jackson's view that it interfered in the political process. Jackson himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from Tennessee to Washington D.C. Jackson won the election decisively by a landslide, receiving 54 {{percent of the popular vote}} and 219 electoral votes. Clay received 37 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes. Wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes while the Anti-Masonic Party folded. Jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the Bank's recharter and his continued warfare on the Bank's control over the national economy.|$|E
25|$|Questions {{surfaced}} {{about the}} value of the instruments he had donated to the Smithsonian and the NJSO. Although the instruments were all old and valuable, several unnamed experts determined them not to be the instruments he represented them as, and not to be as valuable as he claimed. He was said to have invented histories for the instruments to explain away doubts or to increase their worth. On April 13, 2004, Axelrod was indicted in federal court in New Jersey, accused of funnelling millions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>into</b> Swiss bank accounts over 20 years without paying taxes. The following April 21, he failed to appear for his arraignment, having fled to Cuba. He was arrested in Berlin on June 15, 2004 as he got off a plane from Switzerland, and then extradited to the United States. On March 21, 2005 he was sentenced in U.S. court to 18 months in prison for tax fraud.|$|E
25|$|The {{agreement}} {{failed to}} encourage discipline by the Federal Reserve or the United States government. The Federal Reserve {{was concerned about}} {{an increase in the}} domestic unemployment rate due to the devaluation of the dollar. In attempt to undermine the efforts of the Smithsonian Agreement, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates in pursuit of a previously established domestic policy objective of full national employment. With the Smithsonian Agreement, member countries anticipated return flow of dollars to the U.S, but the reduced interest rates within the United States caused dollars to continue to flow out of the U.S. and into foreign central banks. The inflow <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>into</b> foreign banks continued the monetization process of the dollar overseas, defeating the aims of the Smithsonian Agreement. As a result, the dollar price in the gold free market continued to cause pressure on its official rate; soon after a 10% devaluation was announced in February 1973, Japan and the EEC countries decided to let their currencies float. This proved to be the beginning of the collapse of the Bretton Woods System. The end of Bretton Woods was formally ratified by the Jamaica Accords in 1976. By the early 1980s, all industrialised nations were using floating currencies.|$|E

40|$|The Commonwealth Government {{could start}} injecting tens <b>of</b> {{millions}} <b>of</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>into</b> the economy each week by simply increasing {{the size of}} a payment such as the age pension. The current slowing in the world economy has raised a number of important issues about the way that the Australian government, and governments in all developed countries, try to manage the macroeconomy. In particular, recent events in the world financial markets have made monetary policy (that is, changes in interest rates) a less effective mechanism for stimulating the economy, because banks are refusing to pass on reduced interest rates to their customers, while other lenders are having difficulty raising funds in an uncertain environment. Besides monetary policy, the other main mechanism for government’s trying to stimulate a slowing economy is fiscal policy (that is, changes to tax rates and the level of expenditure). When the economy is slowing governments can stimulate economic activity by spending more money, thereby increasing the level of demand for goods and services. Fiscal policy is sometimes criticised for taking too long to flow through to the wider economy, yet the Rudd Government recently announced that it wants to bring forward the implementation of major infrastructure projects so that, {{by the end of the}} year, the expenditure on selected projects can help stimulate employment and economic activity. If targeted in the right way, however, fiscal policy need not be slow. While it takes months to develop and select major infrastructure projects, and sometimes years before the first sod of earth is moved, the Commonwealth Government could start injecting tens <b>of</b> millions <b>of</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>into</b> the economy each week by simply increasing {{the size of a}} payment such as the age pension.
