40|$|The {{following}} {{paper is}} based upon the author's experience of strategic planning for <b>open</b> and flexible <b>learning</b> in Australia, the Caribbean and Asia, his writings in Latchem & Hanna (2001), and the work of others in the field. The paper is designed as a guide for institutions formulating strategic plans for <b>open</b> and flexible <b>learning.</b> It argues that moving into <b>open</b> and flexible <b>learning</b> represents a major paradigm shift and that the reasons for the change and nature of the change must be carefully thought through. The institutional strategic focus must be clear, all of the stakeholders must be consulted, and all of the desired changes must be negotiated throughout the institution. Without these steps, moving into <b>open</b> and flexible <b>learning</b> and re-engineering the roles and procedures will be difficult. The very process of developing a strategic plan helps staff appreciate trends and advances, comprehend the overall vision and mission, and discuss and agree on priorities and goals for <b>open</b> and flexible <b>learning.</b> The paper includes two case studies. One concerns the development of a teaching and learning plan in an Australian university to provide a foundation for <b>open</b> and flexible <b>learning.</b> The other describes how a strategic plan was developed for the introduction of <b>open</b> and flexible <b>learning</b> into a technical and vocational college in Barbados...|$|R
