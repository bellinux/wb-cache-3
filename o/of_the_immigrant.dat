25|$|With {{the waves}} of Jewish aliyah in the 19th and 20th centuries, the {{existing}} culture was supplemented by the culture and traditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immigrant</b> population.

25|$|Since 1948 {{substantial}} {{immigration from}} Africa, the Caribbean and South Asia {{has been a}} legacy of ties forged by the British Empire. Migration from new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe since 2004 has resulted in growth in these population groups, although some of this migration has been temporary. Since the 1990s, there has been substantial diversification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immigrant</b> population, with migrants to the UK coming from a much wider range of countries than previous waves, which tended to involve larger numbers of migrants coming from {{a relatively small number}} of countries.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} sources for surnames. Many Filipinos also have Chinese-derived surnames, {{which in some}} cases could {{indicate}} Chinese ancestry. Many Hispanicised Chinese numerals and other Hispanicised Chinese words, however, were also among the surnames in the Catálogo alfabético de apellidos. For those whose surname may indicate Chinese ancestry, analysis of the surname may help to pinpoint when those ancestors arrived in the Philippines. A Hispanicised Chinese surname such as Cojuangco suggests an 18th-century arrival while a Chinese surname such as Lim suggests a relatively recent immigration. Some Chinese surnames such as Tiu-Laurel are composed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immigrant</b> Chinese ancestor's surname {{as well as the}} name of that ancestor's godparent on receiving Christian baptism.|$|E
25|$|Historically, various Nahua peoples have {{dominated}} the state.

Those considered to be ethnically indigenous are located in 33 municipalities with most concentrated in 15 of these. Many identify as Mixtec, Tlapaneco and Zapotec who have immigrated from Puebla, Guerrero and Oaxaca. Most of those who identify as Nahua are native to the state.

His administration saw a sixfold increase in enrollment from 1911 to 1921, and witnessed Duquesne emerge to become the seventh-largest Catholic school in the country; this meteoric rise can be attributed largely to Hehir's pragmatism and commitment to serving the Catholic community in Pittsburgh {{during a time when}} immigrants struggled to assimilate into larger society. Moreover, {{at the beginning of his}} presidency, Hehir took stock of the needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immigrant</b> community in Pittsburgh and transformed the Pittsburgh Catholic College from a basically liberal arts school into an institution with a focus on more practical disciplines in legal and commercial fields.|$|E
25|$|Polish (and Italian) {{immigrants}} demonstrated high fecundity in the United States, {{and in a}} U.S. Congress {{report in}} 1911, Poles were noted as having the single highest birth rate. The 1911 Dillingham Commission had a section devoted to the Fecundity of Immigrant Women, {{using data from the}} 1900 Census. As per Dillingham's findings, there were 40 births per 1,000 Polish people, whereas the non-Polish birth rate was closer to 14 per 1,000. Historians debate the accuracy and sample group of this data, as many Polish immigrants arrived young and of child-bearing age, whereas other ethnics had a lengthy and sustained immigration policy with the United States, meaning multiple generations existed. In reports, the birth rate was very high for Poles and by 1910, the number of children born to Polish immigrants was larger than the number of arriving Polish immigrants. In Polish communities such as rural Minnesota, nearly three-fourths of all Polish women had at least 5 children. The Polish American baby boom lasted from 1906 to 1915 and then fell dramatically, as many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immigrant</b> mothers had passed out of their prime childbearing age. This was the highest birth rate for American Poles documented in the United States. During the 1920s and 1930s, Polish Americans were coming of age, developing ethnic fraternal organizations, baseball leagues, summer camps, scouting groups, and other youth activities. In large parts of Minnesota and Michigan, over half the population was under sixteen years old. Polish youths created nearly 150 street gangs in Chicago in the 1920s, and in Detroit and Chicago, created the single largest group of inmates in juvenile prisons.|$|E

She turned down her inclusion on People magazine's {{list of the}} [...] "50 Most Beautiful People in the World" [...] the same year. M.I.A.'s status as a style icon, trendsetter and trailblazer is globally affirmed, with her distinct identity, style, and music illuminating social issues of gender, the third world, and popular music. Critics point out that such facets of her public persona underline the importance of authenticity, challenging the globalised popular music market, and demonstrating music's strive to be political. Her albums have been met with acclaim, often heralded as [...] "eclectic" [...] for possessing a genre all their own, [...] "packaging inherent politics {{in the form of}} pleasurable dance music." [...] M.I.A.'s artistic efforts to connect this [...] "extreme eclecticism" [...] with issues of exile, war, violence and terrorism are both commended and criticised. Commentators laud M.I.A.'s use and subversion of her refugee and migrant experiences, through the weaving of musical creativity, artwork and fashion with her personal life as having dispelled stereotypical notions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immigrant</b> experience. This gives her a unique place in popular music, while demanding new responses within popular music, media and fashion culture.
