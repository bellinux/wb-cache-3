The true duplication of the patella, which is called double patella, is extremely rare.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of a 75 -year-old female with {{bilateral}} thigh pain for several years secondary to soft tissue calcification. Massive calcinosis of the soft tissues is a unique, but not uncommon, radiographic finding. On the contrary, tumoral calcinosis is a rare familial disease. The term tumoral calcinosis has been overly used to describe any massive collection of periarticular calcification. The original definition of tumoral calcinosis refers to a hereditary disease associated with massive periarticular calcification without an underlying cause. The lesions of tumoral calcinosis are typically lobulated, well-demarcated calcifications most often distributed along the extensor surfaces of large joints. Many conditions have similar radiographic appearances, including the calcinosis of chronic renal failure, calcific tendinitis, synovial <b>osteochondromatosis,</b> <b>synovial</b> sarcoma, myositis ossificans, tophaceous gout, and calcific myonecrosis. The radiologist plays a critical role in guiding the appropriate tests that can result in a conclusive diagnosis of tumoral calcinosis...|$|E

Patient 32, male, presented with pain and limitation of motion of the elbow. The range of passive motion was 100 ° of flexion and 30 ° extension. The range of active motion was 40 – 90 °. Magnetic resonance observed many loose bodies mainly in the posterior compartment in the olecranon fossa plus some chondral lesions in the capitellum. The arthroscopic treatment was chosen with two anteriors portals (medial and lateral) and two posterior portals (standard posterior and posterolateral) for easing loose bodies and osteoplasty of the olecranon fossa.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Synovial chondromatosis is {{characterized}} by the presence of metaplastic cartilage nodules originating from the synovia, bursa and tendon sheaths. Although it is extremely rare in the ankle joint, malignant transformation is possible. The choice of treatment is usually open surgery for excision of loose bodies and synovectomy. Limited data is available concerning arthroscopic approaches. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 28 -year-old male patient was evaluated for pain and swelling of the right ankle joint. Based on the findings of physical examination and radiographic investigations, arthroscopic surgery was performed due to ankle impingement syndrome. A diagnosis of <b>synovial</b> <b>osteochondromatosis</b> was made following the pathological survey.

Some advantages of arthroscopic surgery are wide visualization areas, easy access to areas difficult to reach, lower morbidity, no necessity for casting and immobilization, early rehabilitation and quick recovery period.
