5|$|The United States {{is often}} {{said to be a}} {{cultural}} melting pot, taking in influences from across the world and creating distinctively new methods of cultural expression. Though aspects of American music {{can be traced back to}} specific origins, claiming any particular original culture for a musical element is inherently problematic, due to the constant evolution of American music through transplanting and hybridizing techniques, instruments and genres. Elements of foreign musics arrived in the United States both through the formal sponsorship of educational and outreach events by individuals and groups, and through informal processes, as in the incidental transplantation of West African music through slavery, and Irish music through immigration. The most distinctly American musics are a result <b>of</b> <b>cross-cultural</b> hybridization through close contact. Slavery, for example, mixed persons from numerous tribes in tight living quarters, resulting in a shared musical tradition that was enriched through further hybridizing with elements of indigenous, Latin, and European music. American ethnic, religious, and racial diversity has also produced such intermingled genres as the French-African music of the Louisiana Creoles, the Native, Mexican and European fusion Tejano music, and the thoroughly hybridized slack-key guitar and other styles of modern Hawaiian music.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{test the}} {{strength}} <b>of</b> a <b>cross-cultural</b> simulation game, Ecotonos, {{in the development}} of cultural intelligence (CQ) and self-efficacy amongst business students. Cross-cultural training is perceived as an important tool to help develop cross-cultural competence in international managers. Within the training literature, a distinction is made between various types of training, roughly the more cognitive knowledge-transferring training formats and more behavioral training formats such as cultural simulation games or cross-cultural role-plays. The impact <b>of</b> these <b>cross-cultural</b> role-plays is perceived to be stronger due to the process of practicing new behavior in an intercultural safe setting. In this study, we test such a behavioral training format, Ecotonos, to investigate the impact <b>of</b> this <b>cross-cultural</b> intervention on the cultural competence of students in higher business education. This study shows that the use <b>of</b> the Ecotonos <b>cross-cultural</b> role-play supports the development of CQ, specifically metacognitive, motivational, and behavioral CQ. Next, it shows an increase in the development <b>of</b> confidence in <b>cross-cultural</b> encounters.

The Institute supported the writing and editing of numerous publications in international psychology including 17 books that have appeared in 5 countries.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT To help {{instructors}} develop lecture {{material to}} introduce the cross-cultural perspective in psychology, the author describes a self-contained teaching module that includes a summary of information, along with supporting references, describing the importance <b>of</b> the <b>cross-cultural</b> perspective while introducing students to two fundamental concepts in the study <b>of</b> the <b>cross-cultural</b> perspective: individualistic and collectivistic cultures. A series of selected topics relating to the expressions of the self (e. g., feelings of happiness and shame/guilt and explanations of personal success and failure) is presented to illustrate these cultural differences. To supplement lecture material and facilitate in-class discussion of these cultural differences, each selected topic includes a brief summary of the major findings, illustrative examples, and supporting references. The nature of the information in this teaching module is appropriate for use by instructors teaching a variety of courses seeking a concise introduction to the topic <b>of</b> the <b>cross-cultural</b> perspective in psychology. In an attempt to promote an appreciation for diversity among individuals in general and within the study of psychology in particular, there is an established trend {{in the teaching of}} psychology for the inclusion <b>of</b> the <b>cross-cultural</b> perspective (e. g., Kitayama & Cohen, 2007). A particularly important lesson to communicate to students is the value <b>of</b> the <b>cross-cultural</b> perspective as both a researc...|$|R

25|$|Since the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale was {{introduced}} in 1953, comprehensive {{research has been done}} regarding the validity of the scale. across different cultures. In 1967, a study <b>of</b> <b>cross-cultural</b> differences in the scale was done between 9 year-old Japanese, French, and American students. The data concluded that Japanese and French students tested significantly lower on anxiety scores compared to the American students. Thus, there are strong cross-cultural differences related to the scores on the TMAS. Additional studies of the validity of the TMAS include a study between South African Natives and South African Europeans in 1979. Both groups included individuals with varying levels of education.This study found that the TMAS is sensitive to certain cross-cultural differences, but precautions should be taken when interpreting scores from the scale in non-Western cultures, regardless of the individual’s education level.|$|E

40|$|I {{report on}} the {{findings}} of an inductive, interpretive multiple-case study <b>of</b> organizational <b>cross-cultural</b> adaptation and answer the question of how foreign companies can overcome the challenges of fitting into their host environment. Based on in-depth interview data from nine Chinese firms operating in the United States, I explore the content and drivers <b>of</b> firm-level <b>cross-cultural</b> adaptation. The emergent framework demonstrates a dynamic and comprehensive process at the firm level, involving a multilevel and multidimensional adaptation to fit through social networking. The identified patterns of adaptors reveal the link between cross-cultural adaptation and functional fitness of firms in a foreign environment. The study also identifies the boundary conditions <b>of</b> the <b>cross-cultural</b> adaptation <b>of</b> foreign firms. In addition, the study highlights the previously underserved aspect of functional fitness in a foreign environment and its essential role in influencing a firm’s overseas performance...|$|R

2500|$|The 19th century {{also saw}} much {{scholarly}} {{interest in the}} reconstruction of pagan mythology from folklore or fairy tales. This was notably attempted by the Brothers Grimm, especially Jacob Grimm in his Teutonic Mythology, and Elias Lönnrot with the compilation of the Kalevala. The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect <b>of</b> <b>cross-cultural</b> influence.

2500|$|On 5 June 1862, Spurgeon {{challenged}} the Church of England when he preached against baptismal regeneration. However, Spurgeon taught across denominational lines as well: for example, in 1877 {{he was the}} preacher {{at the opening of}} a new Free Church of Scotland church building in Dingwall. It was during this period at the new Tabernacle that Spurgeon found a friend in James Hudson Taylor, the founder of the inter-denominational China Inland Mission. Spurgeon supported the work of the mission financially and directed many missionary candidates to apply for service with Taylor. He also aided in the work <b>of</b> <b>cross-cultural</b> evangelism by promoting [...] "The Wordless Book", a teaching tool that he described in a message given on 11 January 1866, regarding Psalm 51:7: [...] "Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow."

The resident curators organize international touring exhibitions that highlight these artworks and help organize educational activities. The Foundation acquires these artworks for its permanent collection and includes them as the focus of exhibitions that open at the museum in New York and subsequently travel to two other cultural institutions or other venues around the world.
