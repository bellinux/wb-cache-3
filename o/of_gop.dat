25|$|In 1975, Fitzmorris was reelected in {{the first}} ever Louisiana nonpartisan blanket primary. One of his minor opponents, Lance Allan Britton (born 1943) of Baton Rouge, later Mansfield, was the only Republican seeking statewide office that year. Britton polled 67,821 votes (6 percent), {{compared}} to Fitzmorris' 924,325 (81.7 percent). At the time, there were 54,862 registered Republicans in Louisiana.

As a consequence, this portfolio is sure to outperform any other significantly different strategy as the time horizon increases. This property in particular has fascinated many researchers in finance and mathematics created a huge and exciting literature on growth optimal investment. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive survey of the literature and applications <b>of</b> the <b>GOP.</b> In particular, the heated debate <b>of</b> whether the <b>GOP</b> has a special place among portfolios in the asset allocation decision is reviewed as this still {{seem to be an}} area where some misconceptions exists.

25|$|On December 20, 2006, Keating visited Columbia, South Carolina, {{where he}} spoke to a group <b>of</b> <b>GOP</b> {{supporters}} about a possible 2008 Presidential bid. On January 17, 2007, Keating {{was quoted in the}} Tulsa World as declining a possible run for the U.S. Presidency in 2008. His reasons for not running were associated with the relative head starts in preparations of U.S. Senator John McCain and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. In February 2007 Keating appeared in Spartanburg, South Carolina and endorsed McCain's bid.|$|E
25|$|Hart {{played an}} active role in the race for {{majority}} leader in early 2006. As a top whip for the successful candidacy of Rep. John Boehner (R-OH), she worked to secure votes for him in the race. She was one of a handful <b>of</b> <b>GOP</b> members who called for a full set of new leadership elections for whip, conference chair, and other offices below the majority leader position, but that motion narrowly failed the day before the majority leader race. Had this motion passed, Hart may have challenged Rep. Deborah Pryce (R-OH) for House Republican Conference Chairman, the No. 4 leadership spot.|$|E
25|$|After {{leading a}} pack of minor {{candidates}} for much of 2010 and 2011, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, despite outmatching his opponents in both money and organization, struggled {{to hold on to}} his lead for the 2012 GOP nomination. As the presidential campaign season headed toward the voting stage in January 2012, one candidate after another surged past Romney, held the lead for a few weeks, then fell back. According to the RealClearPolitics 2012 polling index, five candidates {{at one time or another}} were the top choice <b>of</b> <b>GOP</b> voters: Texas Governor Rick Perry, motivational speaker Herman Cain, former Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Senator Rick Santorum and Romney himself.|$|E

40|$|An Unequal Error Protection (UEP) {{technique}} for H. 264 /AVC video bitstreams constituted by GOP structure is proposed. It is formed by motion energy concept, which {{is defined as}} the energy necessary for displacement of macroblocks between two consecutive frames. The importance <b>of</b> <b>GOPs</b> is determined by their motion energies estimated by Lagrange polynomial. This estimation method expresses a function, which considers previous GOPs having a high correlation with each other. Then, video frames are unequally protected based on their motion activities and the importance <b>of</b> <b>GOPs.</b> Since previous GOPs are used for predicting the current one, no delay for transmission of video bitstreams is required. Simulation results show that with similar Forward Error Correcting (FEC) code rates applied for different protection levels, the proposed technique outperforms other GOP-based UEP techniques...|$|R

500|$|Kemp {{delivered}} speeches {{at several}} Republican National Conventions. He addressed the convention on July 15 at the 1980 Republican National Convention in Detroit, Michigan and on August 21 at the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas. [...] During the 1984 Convention, with Trent Lott as Republican Party Platform Committee chairman, Congressmen Kemp and Newt Gingrich claimed {{control of the}} party platform to the consternation <b>of</b> <b>G.O.P.</b> senators Bob Dole and Howard Baker. Kemp's official role was {{as the chairman of}} the platform subcommittee on foreign policy. [...] However, the three platform planks that he proposed involved tax hikes, the gold standard {{and the role of the}} Federal Reserve. Despite Kemp's official role, his real influence as an author was on the grammatical structure of the plank on tax hikes. By 1985, Kemp was a leading contender for the 1988 Presidential nomination. He also delivered remarks on free enterprise zones at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston, Texas. Despite efforts and considerations of expanding his political domain, Kemp never held a fundraiser outside of his suburban Western New York district until well into his eighth term in Congress.|$|E

2500|$|In the campaign, Fulco {{seemed to}} ignore Sour's {{candidacy}} because the Republican had lost House races in 1964 and 1968. Reports surfaced that Fulco was instead attempting {{to line up}} commitments to become the new House Speaker, but he instead lost his seat in an unusually strong Republican year in Caddo Parish. Sour (1924–2000) had benefited from the election popularity <b>of</b> <b>GOP</b> gubernatorial nominee David C. Treen, who carried Shreveport in his first race for governor. The speakership in turn went to Fulco's fellow Democrat E.L. [...] "Bubba" [...] Henry of Jonesboro, the seat of Jackson Parish in north Louisiana. The position had opened after the Democratic primary runoff in which incumbent John S. Garrett of Haynesville in Claiborne Parish was unseated by the businesswoman Louise B. Johnson of Bernice in Union Parish.|$|E
2500|$|Fulco's {{legislative}} tenure {{coincided with}} the administrations of Governors Earl Kemp Long, Jimmie Davis, and John J. McKeithen. Elected in 1956 and 1960, Fulco won his third term {{as part of a}} Caddo Parish five-member at-large delegation in the general election held on March 3, 1964. Fulco finished fourth among the five winners. Two Republicans, Morley A. Hudson and Taylor W. O'Hearn led the tabulations, followed by Democrats Algie D. Brown, Fulco, and future State Senator and U.S. Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Jr. Eliminated was the sixth-place candidate, veteran Representative Wellborn Jack, a Shreveport attorney. Fulco jokingly declared that [...] "the elephant trampled us" [...] but predicted that he could work well with both Hudson and O'Hearn despite their different parties. The Hudson and O'Hearn victories were attributed that year in part to the coattails <b>of</b> <b>GOP</b> gubernatorial nominee Charlton Lyons of Shreveport.|$|E
2500|$|Orwell's health had {{continued}} to decline since the diagnosis of tuberculosis in December 1947. In mid-1949, he courted Sonia Brownell, and they announced their engagement in September, shortly before he was removed to University College Hospital in London. Sonia took charge of Orwell's affairs and attended him diligently in the hospital, causing concern to some old friends such as Muggeridge. In September 1949, Orwell invited his accountant Harrison to visit him in hospital, and Harrison claimed that Orwell then asked him to become director <b>of</b> <b>GOP</b> Ltd and to manage the company, {{but there was no}} independent witness. Orwell's wedding took place in the hospital room on 13 October 1949, with David Astor as best man. Orwell was in decline and visited by an assortment of visitors including Muggeridge, Connolly, Lucian Freud, Stephen Spender, Evelyn Waugh, Paul Potts, Anthony Powell, and his Eton tutor Anthony Gow. Plans to go to the Swiss Alps were mooted. Further meetings were held with his accountant, at which Harrison and Mr and Mrs Blair were confirmed as directors of the company, and at which Harrison claimed that the [...] "service agreement" [...] was executed, giving copyright to the company. Orwell's health was in decline again by Christmas. On the evening of 20 January 1950, Potts visited Orwell and slipped away on finding him asleep. Jack Harrison visited later and claimed that Orwell gave him 25% of the company. Early on the morning of 21 January, an artery burst in Orwell's lungs, killing him at age 46.|$|E
