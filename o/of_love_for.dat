5|$|The {{exercises}} are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through {{an experience of}} Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director. The process begins with {{a consideration of the}} purpose of one's life and the relationship with the rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response <b>of</b> <b>love</b> <b>for</b> God.|$|E
