5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an <b>offset</b> <b>angle</b> and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E

30|$|A {{dihedral}} <b>angle</b> <b>offset</b> {{is defined}} as a deviation from the right angle of the angles between two neighboring faces. Dihedral <b>angle</b> <b>offsets</b> have been set to 0.5 to 2.0 arcseconds for the retroreflectors on Earth-orbiting artificial satellites to enlarge the far-field diffraction and to compensate for the velocity aberration. The three dihedral angles between the three back faces have typically been set to be symmetric in these cases, {{as was the case in}} Otsubo et al. (2010). Symmetrical dihedral <b>angle</b> <b>offsets</b> symmetrically expand the far-field diffraction pattern. In this study, however, the search of the best dihedral <b>angle</b> <b>offsets</b> is extended by making one dihedral <b>angle</b> <b>offset</b> (“δ 2 ” in Fig. 1) free from the other two. We now attempt to evaluate the far-field diffraction pattern with such asymmetric dihedral <b>angle</b> <b>offsets.</b>|$|R

30|$|When the {{reflector}} size is small, no dihedral <b>angle</b> <b>offsets</b> are required. This {{is because}} the diffraction spread {{is large enough to}} cover the velocity aberration within the first minimum ring. The transition occurs around 80 – 100 -mm size, where there is almost no difference between zero dihedral <b>angle</b> <b>offset</b> and the optimum dihedral <b>angle</b> <b>offset</b> for a large-size retroreflector mentioned below. In the case of a larger reflector size, the dihedral <b>angle</b> <b>offsets</b> becomes advantageous and the optimum combination stays around (0.00, 0.65 – 0.80, 0.00) arcseconds.|$|R

One armature was connected to commutators that were 90 degrees offset from the commutators connected to the other armature. When one set of commutators is aligned with the earth's magnetic field no current is produced, but an <b>offset</b> <b>angle</b> creates a positive or negative current {{in proportion to the}} sine of the <b>offset</b> <b>angle.</b> Since the sine of the angle peaks at 90 degrees, a reading could indicate either a certain direction or the exact opposite direction. The solution to this was a second armature with commutators offset by 90 degrees to help distinguish the two opposite directions.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to improve the efficiency of wind farm power production by applying Bayesian Optimization (BO) in a cooperative game theoretic framework. In the game theoretic framework, wind turbines in a wind farm are treated as agents interacting with other wind turbines through the wake interference. Through minimizing wake interference by coordinated control actions of wind turbines, the power performance of the wind turbines can increase. The goal is to find the optimal, coordinated sets of yaw <b>offset</b> <b>angles</b> and induction factors for wind turbines by applying a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm. In BO, the objective function is modeled as a Gaussian Process (GP) and the optimum point is found by sequentially querying (sampling) the function values. Since BO does not require an explicit form for the objective function, the methodology can be effectively deployed to wind farm power maximization problem whose objective function involves complicated wake interactions and uncertainties in environmental influence such as wind speed and direction. Preliminary results show that BO is able to find the optimal sets of yaw <b>offset</b> <b>angles</b> and induction factors for case studies with wind turbines aligned in a row...|$|R

Antenna <b>offset</b> <b>angle</b> of the missile antenna is set after the target is acquired by the missile seeker using the spectrum location set using closing speed. The missile seeker antenna is a monopulse radar receiver that produces angle error measurements using that fixed position. Flight path is controlled by producing navigation input to the steering system (tail fins or gimbaled rocket) using angle errors produced by the antenna. This steers the body of the missile to hold the target near the centerline of the antenna while the antenna is held in a fixed position.

The formulae and algorithms for predicting the radiation pattern of an offset Fresnel lens antenna are presented in 4, where some experimental results are also reported. Although a simple Fresnel lens antenna has low efficiency, it serves as a very attractive indoor candidate when a large window or an electrically transparent wall is available. In the application of direct broadcasting services (DBS), for example, an offset Fresnel lens can be produced by simply painting a zonal pattern on a window glass or a blind with conducting material.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to improve the cost-effectiveness and production efficiency of wind farms using cooperative control. The key factors in determining the power production and the loading for a wind turbine are the nacelle yaw and blade pitch angles. However, the nacelle and blade angles may adjust the wake direction and intensity in a way that may adversely affect the performance of other wind turbines in the wind farm. Conventional wind-turbine control methods maximize the power production of a single turbine, but can lower the overall wind-farm power efficiency due to wake interference. This paper introduces a cooperative game concept to derive the power production of individual wind turbine so that the total wind-farm power efficiency is optimized. Based on a wake interaction model relating the yaw <b>offset</b> <b>angles</b> and the induction factors of wind turbines to the wind speeds experienced by the wind turbines, an optimization problem is formulated with the {{objective of}} maximizing the sum of the power production of a wind farm. A steepest descent algorithm is applied to find the optimal combination of yaw <b>offset</b> <b>angles</b> and the induction factors that increases the total wind farm power production. Numerical simulations show that the cooperative control strategy can increase the power productions in a wind farm...|$|R

50|$|Two or more rotors may {{be mounted}} {{to the same}} driveshaft, with their {{combined}} co-rotation together turning the same generator: fresh wind is brought to each rotor by sufficient spacing between rotors combined with an <b>offset</b> <b>angle</b> (alpha) from the wind direction. Wake vorticity is recovered as {{the top of a}} wake hits the bottom of the next rotor. Power has been multiplied several times using co-axial, multiple rotors in testing conducted by inventor and researcher Douglas Selsam, for the California Energy Commission in 2004. The first commercially available co-axial multi-rotor turbine is the patented dual-rotor American Twin Superturbine from Selsam Innovations in California, with 2 propellers separated by 12 feet. It is the most powerful 7 ft turbine available, due to this extra rotor. In 2015, Iowa State University aerospace engineers Hui Hu and Anupam Sharma were optimizing designs of multi-rotor systems, including a horizontal-axis co-axial dual-rotor model. In addition to a conventional three-blade rotor, it has a smaller secondary three-blade rotor, covering the near-axis region usually inefficiently harvested.

5000|$|A {{localizer}} type directional aid (LDA) {{is a type}} of localizer-based {{instrument approach}} to an airport. It is used in places where, due to terrain and other factors, the localizer antenna array is not aligned with the runway it serves. In these cases, the localizer antenna array may be offset (i.e. pointed or aimed) {{in such a way that}} the approach course it projects no longer lies along the extended runway centerline (which is the norm for non-offset and non-LDA localizer systems). If the angle of offset is thirty degrees or less, the facility is classified as an offset localizer. If the <b>offset</b> <b>angle</b> is greater than thirty degrees, the facility is classified as a localizer-type directional aid (LDA). As a [...] "directional aid," [...] and only a Category I (CAT I) approach, rather than a full-fledged instrument landing system (ILS), the LDA is more commonly used to help the pilot safely reach a point near the runway environs, where he or she hopefully can see the runway, at which point he or she will proceed and land visually, as opposed to (for example) full Category III (CAT III) ILS systems that allow a pilot to fly, without visual references, very close to the runway surface (usually about 100ft) depending on the exact equipment in the aircraft and on the ground. [...] An LDA uses exactly the same equipment to create the course as a standard localizer used in ILS. An LDA approach also is designed with a normal course width, which is typically 3 to 6 degrees. (At each [...] "edge-of-course," [...] commonly 1.5 or 3 degrees left and right of course, the transmitted signal is created in such a way as to ensure full-scale CDI needle deflection at and beyond these edges, so the pilot will never falsely believe that he is intercepting the course outside of the actual course area. The area between these full-scale needle deflections is what defines the course width.) An LDA approach (considered a non-precision approach) may have one or more marker beacons, perhaps a DME, and in rare instances a glide slope, just as other precision approaches have, such as ILS approaches.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{dynamically}} examine various offset angles on the N-K table to determine which offset produces a torque pattern corresponding most closely to the isokinetic torque curve of the knee flexor musculature when tested at 60 %. Subjects for the study were five college-age male volunteers (age= 21. 8 ± 1. 8 yrs, ht= 181. 9 ± 4. 3 cm, wt= 88. 4 ± 12. 6 kg). Mean peak isokinetic torque values for the five subjects were measured at 5 ° increments to represent the human knee flexor torque curve. These were converted to relative mean values by dividing each value by the maximum mean peak torque. Torque curves from four offset angles (90 °, 110 °, 135 °, and 160 °) for the N-K table were obtained by using the Kin Com in the passive mode at 20 °/s to push the exercise arm of the N-K table through a range of motion of 0 ° to 90 ° while recording torque and angular position. The four torque curves were converted to relative values in a similar manner as for the subjects. Qualitative analysis reveals that the 160 ° <b>offset</b> <b>angle</b> most closely corresponded to the representative knee flexor isokinetic torque curve, while the 90 ° <b>offset</b> <b>angle</b> corresponded least. Although these findings would seem to support reconsideration of common clinical practice relative to the use of the N-K table for knee flexor strength development, the 160 ° <b>offset</b> <b>angle</b> is awkward because it has a tendency to force the user into hyperextension at the beginning phase of motion.
