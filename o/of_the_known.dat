5|$|Bioinformatic screens have {{predicted}} that over 250 human proteins contain prion-like domains (PrLD). These domains are hypothesized {{to have the same}} transmissible, amyloidogenic properties of PrP and known fungal proteins. As in yeast, proteins involved in gene expression and RNA binding seem to be particularly enriched in PrLD's, compared to other classes of protein. In particular, 29 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>known</b> 210 proteins with an RNA recognition motif also have a putative prion domain. Meanwhile, several of these RNA-binding proteins have been independently identified as pathogenic in cases of ALS, FTLD-U, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease.|$|E
