5|$|By {{the age of}} 16, Booth was {{interested}} in the theatre and in politics, and he became a delegate from Bel Air to a rally by the Know Nothing Party for Henry Winter Davis, the anti-immigrant party's candidate for Congress in the 1854 elections. Booth aspired to follow in the footsteps <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> his actor brothers Edwin and Junius Brutus, Jr. He began practicing elocution daily in the woods around Tudor Hall and studying Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Edward died in 924. His realms {{appear to}} have been divided with the West Saxons {{recognising}} Ælfweard while the Mercians chose Æthelstan who had been raised at Æthelflæd's court.

60|$|Aubrey {{knew the}} outward {{aspect of the}} place, for the foreman at the mill was a {{frequent}} patient <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>father's,</b> <b>and</b> he had often waited in the old gig at the cottage door at no great distance; but he looked with more critical eyes at the home <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friend.|$|R

5|$|In November 1982, Daley {{announced}} his first campaign for mayor. The {{candidates in the}} three-way Democratic primary, which included incumbent Mayor Jane Byrne, a former protegée <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> Congressman Harold Washington, {{held a series of}} four televised debates. Daley finished third. Many of Richard J.'s political allies blamed Richard M. for splitting the white vote, enabling Washington to become Chicago's first black mayor.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene, young {{children}} tell their {{versions of the}} invasion. They draw pictures of their families, kids with harnesses and the alien airships. Tom Mason's (Noah Wyle) son, Matt, tells Anne Glass (Moon Bloodgood) that his mother died during the attacks and his older brother, Ben, was kidnapped. He then shows her a picture <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> oldest brother, Hal (Drew Roy). Matt informs Anne that they are fighting.|$|E

5|$|This {{meant that}} his pyramid {{was out of}} the {{alignment}} formed by the preceding ones, limited its size and constrained the layout of his mortuary complex. This would explain why, despite having enjoyed one of the longest reigns of the Fifth Dynasty, Nyuserre's pyramid was smaller than that <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> closer in size to that of his grandfather Sahure.|$|E
5|$|Al-Jamri {{has written}} two books in Arabic, Memories of Childhood (2007) and Interventions on Thought and Politics (2008). The former is a {{narrative}} of al-Jamri's childhood in Iraq, the experiences he had and the events he witnessed. He was motivated to write it by people's reactions following the death <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> dedicated the book to his memory. The latter deals with political and ideological concepts in Europe and the Muslim world, and how Muslim countries can benefit from {{them in order to}} consolidate the political pluralism within the Islamic theme. Al-Jamri also writes a daily column in Al-Wasat and regular articles on politics and human rights for other publications such as Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{were missing}} defender Sol Campbell from their team {{after the death}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> manager Arsène Wenger dropped wingers Robert Pirès and Sylvain Wiltord in favour of Ray Parlour and Fredrik Ljungberg, {{creating}} a more physical midfield. Wenger's tactics worked, as the Arsenal defence withstood the pressure from the Manchester United attack. United themselves were without Paul Scholes due to injury, and they played a 4–3–2–1 formation with Phil Neville, Roy Keane and Quinton Fortune completing a defensively minded midfield.|$|E

5|$|At the convention, Hoffman has {{replaced}} the heating elements for the chafing-dishes with his own. Olivia and Peter struggle with locating Hoffman before Walter and Astrid (Jasika Nicole) arrive. Walter uses a fogger to distribute his own chemical agent, this time specific to Hoffman, and soon the man is found dying. As the team regroups, Walter fully admits to killing Hoffman, a crime in itself, but Broyles (Lance Reddick) decides to let Walter go. Later, Peter {{has been able to}} recover the rest of his grandfather's work and returns it to Walter; Walter then goes through the files, finding an old photo <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> Hoffman working together.|$|E
5|$|By late 1461, risings in {{the north}} had been put down, and {{in the summer of}} 1462, Warwick {{negotiated}} a truce with Scotland. In October the same year, Margaret of Anjou invaded England with troops from France, and managed to take the castles of Alnwick and Bamburgh. Warwick had to organise the recapture of the castles, which was accomplished by January 1463. The leaders of the rebellion, including Sir Ralph Percy, were pardoned and left in charge of the retaken castles. At this point, Warwick felt secure enough to travel south; in February he buried the remains <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> brother at Bisham Priory, and in March he attended parliament at Westminster.|$|E
5|$|Chinese Nü Yr is an electronica album using {{elements}} of bass, grime and 2-step garage. Malliagh explained that Chinese Nü Yr is based {{a story about}} 'Xiāngjiāo', a gelatinous and amorphous worm who wears a witch hat and is voiced by heavily pitch-shifted and processed recordings <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> little sister. Xiāngjiāo is forced to go through portals in colorful and nonsensical lands, having to dodge things such as peanuts, floating fruit, pink-colored fog, and mountains growing out of the ground. Xiāngjiāo fears both the unfamiliarity of future lands and the extreme speed at which it travels. In a December 2015 interview, Malliagh stated {{the fate of the}} worm will occur in a full-length album.|$|E

5|$|Conroy {{followed}} in the footsteps <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> two uncles in playing hockey at Clarkson University for the Golden Knights. He enrolled at Clarkson in 1990 and played four seasons for the school. During his junior season of 1992–93, Conroy scored two goals in a 5–3 victory over Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) semi-final to help lead his team to the conference championship game. Conroy reached 100 career points with the goals, joining his father Mike as the only such pair in Clarkson's history to reach that milestone. Conroy and the Golden Knights then won the ECAC title with a 3–1 victory over Brown University.|$|E
5|$|Following in the {{footsteps}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> grandfather, McCain entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. He was a friend and informal leader there for many of his classmates, and sometimes stood up for targets of bullying. He also became a lightweight boxer. McCain did well in academic subjects that interested him, such as literature and history, but studied only enough to pass subjects that gave him difficulty, such as mathematics. He came into conflict with higher-ranking personnel and did not always obey the rules, which contributed to a low class rank (894 of 899), despite a high IQ. McCain graduated in 1958.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} year of his life, George was the only heir to the German territories <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> three childless uncles. George's brother, Frederick Augustus, was born in 1661, and the two boys (known as Görgen and Gustchen by the family) were brought up together. Their mother was absent for almost a year (1664–65) during a long convalescent holiday in Italy, but corresponded {{regularly}} with her sons' governess and took a great interest in their upbringing, even more so upon her return. Sophia bore Ernest Augustus another four sons and a daughter. In her letters, Sophia describes George as a responsible, conscientious child who set an example to his younger brothers and sisters.|$|E
