40|$|AbstractCausal counterfactuals e. g., ‘if the <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> {{had been}} turned then the car would have started’ and causal conditionals e. g., ‘if the <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> was turned then the car started’ are {{understood}} by thinking about multiple possibilities of different sorts, as shown in six experiments using converging evidence from three different types of measures. Experiments 1 a and 1 b showed that conditionals that comprise enabling causes, e. g., ‘if the <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> was turned then the car started’ primed people to read quickly conjunctions referring {{to the possibility of}} the enabler occurring without the outcome, e. g., ‘the <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> was turned and the car did not start’. Experiments 2 a and 2 b showed that people paraphrased causal conditionals by using causal or temporal connectives (because, when), whereas they paraphrased causal counterfactuals by using subjunctive constructions (had…would have). Experiments 3 a and 3 b showed that people made different inferences from counterfactuals presented with enabling conditions compared to none. The implications of the results for alternative theories of conditionals are discussed...|$|R

50|$|The <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> {{controls}} the normal expected functions of accessories, ignition circuit and starting. When the <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> is momentarily {{moved to the}} start position the main traction battery relay is energised (causing a clunk) which allows the accelerator to move the vehicle as normal. The function of the ignition switch is slightly different from regular cars as only the stop light and the handbrake light (if the handbrake is applied) are displayed. On other cars all the indicator lights are shown to check bulb condition.|$|R

40|$|Suppose {{that you}} are given the {{following}} information: “If the <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> is turned, then the car starts.

Likewise, when you are told, “If the <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> is turned, then the car starts. The igni-tion key is turned. ” You might conclude that “the car will start. ” However, if you are told that the car might have a dead battery or be out of fuel, you would be rather reluc-tant to infer that “the car will start. ” Cognitive scientists have conducted a great deal of re-search to establish how people reason with these “if, then...|$|R

50|$|The Japanese {{versions}} offered electrically folding power mirrors, 8-way power {{drivers seat}} with power recline {{for the seat}} back, and infrared keyless remote entry integrated into the <b>ignition</b> <b>key.</b> The GT and VZ had a feature where the driver's door could be opened without using a key or remote, using a driver programmed security code that was entered by pulling the exterior door handle a specific number of times, in accordance with a 4-digit security code found in its memory. This feature was only installed on vehicles with the infrared keyless remote. Vehicles equipped with the infrared keyless remote feature can be identified by having a dark plastic receiver patch installed on the driver's door handle, located directly above the entry lock keyhole. The transmitter installed in the <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> was aimed at this receiver patch on the door handle.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, {{the price}} rose to $57,183. Allanté's engine, the new 273ci (4.5L) V8, {{produced}} 200 horsepower, and with 270 lbft Nm, it provided the most torque from any front-wheel-drive automobile in the world. Unlocking the trunk also unlocked the side doors - similar to Mercedes-Benz and BMW. As a theft-deterrent, Allanté added GM's Pass Key (Personal Automotive Security System), utilizing a resistor pellet within the <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> {{that has the}} ability to render the fuel system and starter inoperative if an incorrect <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> is used. Allanté also received a new speed-sensitive damper system called Speed Dependent Damping Control, or SD²C. This system firmed up the suspension at 25 mph and again at 60 mph. The firmest setting was also used when starting from a standstill until 5 mph. Another change was a variable-assist steering system.|$|R

50|$|The Saab 99 (saloon model) {{featured}} a heating duct {{leading to the}} rear window - a lever between the front seats controlled the de-fogging airflow.

This arrangement required drivers to select reverse gear before the <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> could be removed.|$|R
50|$|This {{starting}} method inspired Porsche {{to locate the}} <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> switch {{to the left of}} the steering wheel.
