5|$|As {{an obsessive}} new mother {{who has spent}} many an hour {{hovering}} over my son with a thermometer and a pre-emptive bottle of Calpol, Rachel's contention that she didn't want to go <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner</b> with Adam because she couldn't bear to leave three-month-old Matthew {{in the care of}} their best friend's children's nanny was just one niggling implausibility too far. After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.|$|E

After her predicament was reported in The New York Times, she received letters and telegrams that included marriage proposals. Her background story and a letter of credit eventually verified her identity, but she was deported after a New York doctor pronounced her insane. Later the same month The New York Times reported on first-class passengers' complaints over privileges for their dogs and the conditions in the kennel aboard the liner.

There was a comfortable room where women could sew, knit, and talk as they pleased, or they could, if they liked, sit in the general room with their husbands.

Ivan's ex-wife Jordan (Erin Shanagher) caught him with another man, outed him and which resulted in a [...] "horrendous" [...] reaction from those he knew. Brocklebank said that this causes his reluctance to come out again because [...] "he's become scared about opening himself up to a new community of people and is worried about the villagers' reaction." ...|$|E

McGregor commented [...] "He thinks he's blown his chances with her – but he's also wondering if this is what he really wants." ...|$|E

500|$|Chuck's {{father and}} co-pilot. Kazinsky stated Martini hated {{the fact that}} he was cast as Chuck's father, being only 13 years Kazinsky's senior. However, Kazinsky said they {{developed}} a bond while filming, [...] "Because we were working so tight together, we would finish and then we would go <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner</b> every night and we would go to the gym together on days off we had… The emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very easy for me to play because I had grown to actually genuinely love Max as a man and as a friend." [...] Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck's pet bulldog was del Toro's idea and said, [...] "The dog's name was Max, ironically, and we ended up using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn't show each other they would show the dog." [...] The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman's Herc and Hunnam's Raleigh [...] "might start to feel like Sons of Anarchy 2.0".|$|E
500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1996, Oasis were widely considered, {{according}} to guitarist Noel Gallagher, [...] "the biggest band in the world... bigger than, dare I say it, fucking God." [...] The commercial success of the band's two previous albums had resulted in media frenzy and an ubiquity in the mainstream press that {{was in danger of}} leading to a backlash. Oasis members were by then being invited to functions at 10 Downing Street by Prime Minister Tony Blair and holidaying with Johnny Depp and Kate Moss in Mick Jagger's villa in Mustique. During their last stay on the island, Noel wrote the majority of the songs that would make up Oasis's third album. He had suffered from writer's block during the previous winter, and has since admitted he wrote only a single guitar riff in the six months following the release of (What's the Story) Morning Glory?. After a few weeks [...] "idling", he disciplined himself to a routine of songwriting where he would go [...] "into this room in the morning, come out for lunch, go back in, come <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner,</b> go back in, then go to bed." [...] Noel has later said about the album [...] "...most of the songs were written before I even got a record deal, I went away and wrote the lyrics in about two weeks." [...] The band's producer Owen Morris joined Gallagher later with a TASCAM 8-track recorder, and they recorded demos with a drum machine and a keyboard.|$|E

The only problem is that Sam assumes that Rosie is Joanna Rupelford.|$|E

She told them that [...] "John gave me some pill last night and it really knocked me out". She spent most of the following day in bed after she vomited her breakfast. After checking on her several times, Hill told the two house guests that he was going out to purchase medication for her. Hill took his son and the two women <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner</b> that evening, but Joan was too sick to join them.

Moreover, Bazlen's daughter, Marguerite, stated in a 2007 interview that Bazlen was a very private person who spoke very little about her past and that [...] "She was very kind-hearted, very fair, emotional. [...] Not affectionate, as kind-hearted as she was, {{she was not a}} touchy feely kind of person." [...] Bazlen's daughter also recalled that Bazlen was a very witty person with a dry sense of humor and that her reluctance to talk openly about her acting career was related to her shyness because [...] "Whenever one of her movies would air, she made sure we all went <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner</b> so we couldn't stay home and watch! [...] It wasn't that she was embarrassed by it, but I think once she left that world she was shy about it. [...] She was very proud of her work on The Blue Fairy." ...|$|E
