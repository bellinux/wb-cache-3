Results: Four studies were identified, including 1802 AMED consumers. The meta-analysis showed no significant difference in <b>overall</b> alcohol <b>consumption</b> between AMED and alcohol only occasions (P = 0. 783, 95 % confidence interval - 0. 191 to 0. 253).

The overall electricity consumption during the entire July and August was also 14% less than the previous year. The peak electricity consumption within TEP's area was 12.46GW during the 2011 summer, 3.11GW (20%) less than the peak consumption in the previous year, and the <b>overall</b> <b>consumption</b> have been reduced by 11% in July with 17% in August compared to previous year. Japanese government continue to ask the public to conserve electricity for several years until year 2016, when it predicted that the supply will be sufficient to meet demand, thanks to the deepening of the mindset to conserve electricity among corporate and general public, addition of new electricity providers due to the electricity liberalization policy, increased output from renewable energy as well as fossil fuel power stations, as well as sharing of electricity between different electricity companies.|$|E

30|$|The <b>overall</b> energy <b>consumptions</b> of the {{protocols}} {{are shown in}} Table 3. The energy consumption of TTDD is higher than HexDD and LBDD, since as the sink moves, it tends to reconstruct a new path to a dissemination node on the grid by local query flooding and agent updates. Also, LBDD floods the query of the sink in the inline region for its location updates. HexDD has the smallest <b>overall</b> energy <b>consumption.</b> These simulation results about energy consumptions of {{the protocols}} agree with our theoretical analysis on communication costs of the protocols in Section 5.2. Although HexDD achieves a lower <b>overall</b> energy <b>consumption,</b> the nodes in the central cells in HexDD are more heavily loaded then other protocols. In the following section, we investigate the effect of rendezvous region resizing on the central nodes and on the overall network performance.|$|R
