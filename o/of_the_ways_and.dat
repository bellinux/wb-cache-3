5|$|In 1889, {{with the}} Republicans in the majority, McKinley sought {{election}} as Speaker of the House. He failed {{to gain the}} post, which went to Thomas B. Reed of Maine; however, Speaker Reed appointed McKinley chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> Means Committee. The Ohioan guided the McKinley Tariff of 1890 through Congress; although McKinley's work was altered through the influence of special interests in the Senate, it imposed a number of protective tariffs on foreign goods.|$|E

25|$|One year earlier, he {{was elected}} as Brattleboro's {{representative}} in the Vermont House of Representatives, {{to which he was}} re-elected in 1882. During his first session, {{he was elected}} to judge-advocate-general by the Legislature. In his second, he was elected chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>and</b> means committee. Hooker was also very involved with his community and held several positions, like selectman, bailiff, and road commissioner. He was the president of the Vermont Agricultural Society, Vermont's Horse Breeders' Association, and held office for the Valley Fair Association from its formation in 1886. He was part of forming and raised most of the subscriptions for stock for the Valley Fair Association. During the remainder of his years he was active in the Hooker, Corser & Mitchell Overall Company.|$|E

25|$|McLane {{was first}} elected to the U.S. House of Representatives by {{defeating}} Thomas Clayton for the Federalist nomination, as Clayton was politically damaged by having voted for a Congressional pay raise in the previous session. From then on the Clayton cousins became McLane’s principle political opponents in Delaware. Nevertheless, McLane was elected six times as a Federalist to the U.S. House of Representatives, from 1816 through 1826. He had a most distinguished career in the U.S. House, serving five full terms from March 4, 1817 to March 3, 1827. In spite being a Federalist, he was Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> Means Committee {{and it was only}} his Federalist affiliation that prevented him from being elected Speaker.|$|E
25|$|Kay {{started his}} {{political}} career in local politics in McMinnville where he served on the city council and school board. In 1902, {{he was elected to}} the Oregon House of Representatives as a Republican to a two-year term. He represented district 1 that included Marion County, and was the chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>and</b> means committee. Kay was re-elected to a second term in the house in 1904 and served through the 1905 legislative session. During the 1905 session he lost out on being Speaker of the House by a single vote to A. L. Mills. In 1906, Kay was elected to a four-year term in the Oregon State Senate. He again represented district 1 as a Republican, and served through the 1909 special session of the Oregon Legislative Assembly.|$|E
25|$|The Union grew rich {{fighting}} the war, as the Confederate economy was destroyed. The Republicans in control in Washington had a Whig {{vision of an}} industrial nation, with great cities, efficient factories, productive farms, national banks, and high-speed rail links. The South had resisted policies such as tariffs to promote industry and homestead laws to promote farming because slavery would not benefit; with the South gone, and Northern Democrats very weak in Congress, the Republicans enacted their legislation. At {{the same time they}} passed new taxes to pay for part of the war, and issued large amounts of bonds to pay for the most of the rest. (The remainder can be charged to inflation.) They wrote an elaborate program of economic modernization that had the dual purpose of winning the war and permanently transforming the economy. The key policy-maker in Congress was Thaddeus Stevens, as chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> Means Committee. He took charge of major legislation that funded the war effort and revolutionized the nation's economic policies regarding tariffs, bonds, income and excise taxes, national banks, suppression of money issued by state banks, greenback currency, and western railroad land grants.|$|E

25|$|Under the Fiscal Year 2010 budget resolution, {{the text}} of the {{reconciliation}} bill submitted to the Budget Committee had to have been reported by the relevant Committees by October 15, 2009. Therefore, the Democrats combined {{the text of}} America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 as reported out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> Means Committee, and as it was reported out of the Education and Labor Committee, and {{the text of the}} Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act as reported out of the Education and Labor Committee. This version was never meant to be passed; it was only created so that the reconciliation bill would comply with the Budget resolution. The bill was automatically amended to the version that was meant to be passed per the special rule that was reported out of the Rules Committee. The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act was added to the Reconciliation Act as only one reconciliation bill can be passed each budget year, and it also faced a tough road through the Senate due to Republican filibuster and opposition from several centrist Democratic Senators. The move was also thought to give President Obama two key victories in overhauling the health care and student loan system. It also eventually became clear that the budget savings caused by the student loan bill would become essential to the overall reconciliation bill by reducing the deficit enough for the overall bill to qualify for the reconciliation process.|$|E

500|$|Momentum quickly {{built against}} Rangel, with 30 or more Democrats {{planning}} to oppose his continued chairmanship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> Means Committee, {{in a full}} House vote being pushed by Republicans. [...] Democrat Paul Hodes of New Hampshire noted: I think we're in a zero-tolerance atmosphere, and I think ... Washington should be held to the highest ethical standards. I have the greatest admiration for Mr. Rangel's service to this country. He's been a great public servant. This is very, very unfortunate, but I think it's necessary.|$|E

500|$|In 1981, Rangel {{shifted to}} become {{chairman}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> Means Subcommittee on Oversight, {{which gave him}} power {{in dealing with the}} Reagan administration's cuts in social spending. [...] By 1983 he was the third-ranking member on Ways and Means, and worked well with its powerful chairman, Dan Rostenkowski. [...] Rangel also became a protégé of Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, who made him Deputy Majority Whip that same year. [...] In the United States presidential election, 1984, Rangel supported former Vice President Walter Mondale, rather than the primary campaign of Jesse Jackson.|$|E
500|$|In 1993 Neal {{moved to}} the House Ways and Means Committee, where he {{currently}} serves. He has been chairman of the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures since 2008 {{and is a member}} of the Subcommittee on Trade. Previously he served on the Oversight and Social Security subcommittees. In the late 2000s analysts considered Neal a likely frontrunner for chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> Means Committee, and in the wake of Charles B. Rangel's 2010 departure he began actively seeking the post. In June 2010, while pursuing the chairmanship, he invited campaign contributors to a $5,000-per-person weekend fundraiser in Cape Cod. This drew fire from The Boston Globe, which criticized him for [...] " [...] to the capital's money culture." ...|$|E
500|$|A myth {{has arisen}} that Bryan was an unknown prior to 1896. This {{was not the}} case; Bryan was well known as an orator on the tariff and silver questions.

As a Democratic member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> Means Committee through two Congresses, Mr. Bryan was by all odds the ablest and strongest orator on the Democratic side of the House. His subsequent canvass [...] for the United States senatorship in Nebraska was noteworthy and conspicuous on many accounts." ...|$|E

500|$|As the {{responsibilities}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> Means chairman had been divided, Stevens took {{the post of}} chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, retaining control over the House's agenda. [...] Stevens focused on legislation that would secure the freedom promised by the newly ratified Thirteenth Amendment. He proposed and then co-chaired the Joint Committee on Reconstruction with Maine Senator William Pitt Fessenden. This body, also called the Committee of Fifteen, investigated conditions in the South. [...] It heard {{not only of the}} violence against African-Americans, but against Union loyalists, and against what southerners termed [...] "carpetbaggers", northerners who had journeyed south after the restoration of peace. Stevens declared: that [...] "our loyal brethren at the South, whether they be black or white" [...] required urgent protection [...] "from the barbarians who are now daily murdering them." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1974 elections, New York State Democratic Chairman, Joseph Crangle, {{attempted}} to block Eve from obtaining the Democratic nomination. After the 1974 election, Eve was the senior Assemblyman among the blacks and Puerto Ricans. [...] Following the 1974 elections in which 15 of the 18 newly Democratic seats were from non-New York City Democrats, the upstate delegation {{was credited with}} giving the democrats a majority. [...] That year marked {{the year in which}} upstate democrats demanded that there be some division of the Democratic minority leader, Democratic deputy minority leader, Assistant minority leader, minority whip, and ranking member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> Means committee, which had all previously been given to New York City officials. Incoming Governor Hugh Carey was also interested in a geographic division of key positions in order to promote party unity. Eve sat on a 1978 Medicaid reimbursement evaluation committee.|$|E
500|$|Maine Representative Nelson Dingley Jr. was McKinley's {{choice for}} Secretary of the Treasury; he {{declined}} it, preferring {{to remain as}} chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> Means Committee. Charles Dawes, who had been Hanna's lieutenant in Chicago during the campaign, was considered for the Treasury post but by some accounts Dawes considered himself too young. Dawes eventually became Comptroller of the Currency; he recorded in his published diary that he had strongly urged McKinley to appoint as secretary the successful candidate, Lyman J. Gage, president of the First National Bank of Chicago and a Gold Democrat. The Navy Department was offered to former Massachusetts Congressman John Davis Long, an old friend from the House, on January 30, 1897. Although McKinley was initially inclined to allow Long to choose his own assistant, there was considerable pressure on the President-elect to appoint Theodore Roosevelt, head of the New York City Police Commission and a published naval historian. McKinley was reluctant, stating to one Roosevelt booster, [...] "I want peace and I am told that your friend Theodore is always getting into rows with everybody." [...] Nevertheless, he made the appointment.|$|E
