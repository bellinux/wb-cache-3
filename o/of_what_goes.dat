25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} originally {{outlined by}} Hugh Everett III in 1957 is partly meant {{to reconcile the}} differences between Einstein's and Bohr's views by replacing Bohr's wave function collapse with an ensemble of deterministic and independent universes whose distribution is governed by wave functions and the Schr√∂dinger equation. Thus, uncertainty in the many-worlds interpretation follows from each observer within any universe having no knowledge <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> on in the other universes.|$|E
25|$|Any {{explanation}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> on in {{a specific}} individual observation of one photon has {{to take into account}} the whole experimental apparatus of the complete quantum state consisting of both photons, and it can only make sense after all information concerning complementary variables has been recorded. Our results demonstrate that the viewpoint that the system photon behaves either definitely as a wave or definitely as a particle would require faster-than-light communication. Because this would be in strong tension with the special theory of relativity, we believe that such a viewpoint should be given up entirely.|$|E
2500|$|The Copenhagen interpretation, {{put forth}} {{by some of the}} pioneers in the field of quantum mechanics, asserts that it is {{undesirable}} to posit anything that goes beyond the mathematical formulae and the kinds of physical apparatus and reactions that enable us to gain some knowledge <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> on at the atomic scale. One of the mathematical constructs that enables experimenters to predict very accurately certain experimental results is sometimes called a probability wave. In its mathematical form it is analogous to the description of a physical wave, but its [...] "crests" [...] and [...] "troughs" [...] indicate levels of probability for the occurrence of certain phenomena (e.g., a spark of light at a certain point on a detector screen) that can be observed in the macro world of ordinary human experience.|$|E

2500|$|Audrey {{moves into}} the [...] "Old Lodge", {{at the end of}} the drive, where she can see most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> on at the manor. Living with her is her elderly and loyal butler, Brabinger, who has worked for the fforbes-Hamiltons his whole life, and her beagle Bertie. Audrey's {{supportive}} best friend, and a frequent visitor, is the well-meaning Marjory Frobisher, who quickly develops a crush on DeVere. Marjory, who was at school with Audrey, is still a schoolgirl at heart and a committed countryside campaigner. Marjory has no organisational ability, which leads to her being nicknamed [...] "Muddlesome Marj" [...] by some. Despite Marjory's encouragement, Audrey refuses to get a job, saying her only job could be running the Grantleigh estate and doing other public service, which includes her being a magistrate. This means that money is a constant problem. During the second series, Brabinger is away ill; and Ned, whose tied cottage is being renovated by Richard, takes over as butler to Audrey. Ned, a gardener and [...] "outside man", has worked on the estate all his life and finds working indoors difficult to get used to. Other estate staff include the estate foreman Mr. Miller, the estate manager Mr. Spalding and the cook Mrs. Beecham. Another character, Polly, originally works at the local [...] "Cavendish Foods" [...] store and then at the doctors' surgery, while Linda Cartwright works in the stables and as a domestic. The postman, Mr. Purvis, appears in two episodes.|$|E
2500|$|Stephen Holden in The New York Times {{praised the}} [...] "taut, {{economical}} screenplay" [...] that [...] "digs into its characters' marrow (and into the perfectly selected details of domestic life) without wasting a word. That screenplay helps to ground a film whose visual imagination hovers somewhere between soap opera and a portentous pop surrealism." [...] USA Today gave the film three-and-a-half stars {{out of four}} and Mike Clark wrote, [...] "Diane Lane also reaches a new career plateau with her best performance since 1979's A Little Romance." [...] In his review for the Washington Post, Stephen Hunter wrote, [...] "In the end, Unfaithful leaves you dispirited and grumpy: All that money spent, all that talent wasted, all that time gone forever, and for what? It's an ill movie that bloweth no man to good." [...] David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek, wrote, [...] "Unfaithful shows what a powerful, sexy, smart filmmaker Lyne can be. It's a shame he substitutes the mechanics of suspense for the real suspense <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> on {{between a man and}} a woman, a husband and a wife." [...] Andrew Sarris, in his review for The New York Observer, wrote, [...] "Ultimately Unfaithful is escapism in its purest form, and I am willing to experience it on that level, even though with all the unalloyed joy on display, there's almost no humor," [...] and concluded that it was [...] "one of the very few mainstream movies currently directed exclusively to grown-ups." ...|$|E
2500|$|Terry Bogard is {{typically}} a cheerful and friendly fellow to everyone around him. He seems to bear no ill will towards {{anyone other than}} Geese Howard, the killer of his adoptive father. He {{and his younger brother}} Andy Bogard were orphans adopted by Jeff Bogard, who was killed by Geese Howard when Terry and Andy were children. Wishing to take revenge, Terry trained alone in the streets until he developed a unique fighting style which combines moves from various martial arts. He became strong enough to enter The King of Fighters tournament, in which he {{is often referred to as}} the Legendary Hungry Wolf (from , the Japanese title of his [...] ) for his remarkable skills. Although Terry manages to defeat Geese, he tries to save him when Geese is about to fall from a tower. Geese refuses this help, and seemingly falls to his death, though he's since returned in numerous games. Some time after that, Terry met Geese's son, Rock Howard, and started taking care of him. He treats Rock as his son, but gives him some freedom of choice. Terry appears to fit many Japanese stereotypes for an American character in appearance, personality and speech (his in-game vocabulary is usually limited to American colloquialisms, such as [...] "Okay!" [...] and [...] "Hey, c'mon, c'mon."). [...] He has a pet monkey named [...] which commonly appears around him in some games. Terry is also streetsmart as his knowledge <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> on in the streets and slang is vast. During the Fatal Fury series, Terry meets Blue Mary, with whom he appears to have a longtime relationship.|$|E
