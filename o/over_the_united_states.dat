5|$|Frank E. Holman, {{president}} of the American Bar Association (ABA), called attention to Federal court decisions, notably Missouri v. Holland, which he claimed could give international treaties and agreements precedence <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Constitution and {{could be used by}} foreigners to threaten American liberties. Senator Bricker was influenced by the ABA's work and first introduced a constitutional amendment in 1951. With substantial popular support and the election of a Republican president and Congress in the elections of 1952, together with support from many Southern Democrats, Bricker's plan seemed destined to be sent to the individual states for ratification.|$|E
5|$|Hope's {{absence from}} the early bebop scene largely {{continued}} {{after he left the}} army, as he played principally in rhythm and blues bands for a few years. He was part of an octet led by trumpeter Eddie Robinson late in 1947, and played briefly with Snub Mosley around the same time. Hope had his first long-term association, with the Joe Morris band, from 1948 to 1951, including for several recordings. This band toured all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, {{fulfilling}} these promises proves {{costly and}} Mayor Quimby denounces Homer for spending the department's yearly budget {{in only a}} month. Homer gets cities all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> to pay him to store their excess garbage into an abandoned mine shaft {{on the outskirts of}} Springfield. Despite the budget crisis having ended and the workers receiving their salaries as promised, the garbage builds up underground and eventually erupts, pouring trash all over the town. At a town hall meeting, Homer is fired from his post and replaced with Ray Patterson, who declines reinstatement. With no other options left, Quimby moves the entire town five miles down the road.|$|E

40|$|This study evaluates {{impacts of}} land use changes due to human {{settlement}} on regional summer climate <b>over</b> <b>the</b> central and western <b>United</b> <b>States</b> by performing 30 -day simulations during normal, drought, and flood years. Under current land use the simulated evapotranspiration increased noticeably <b>over</b> <b>the</b> central <b>United</b> <b>States</b> where grassland {{has been replaced by}} crops. Simulated evapotranspiration decreased slightly in <b>the</b> western <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> These changes produced wetter and cooler surface air <b>over</b> <b>the</b> central <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and slightly drier and warmer air <b>over</b> <b>the</b> western <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Responses of surface fluxes and thus screen height variables to land use changes were consistent from year to year, whereas rainfall showed strong interannual variations because of the combination of various dynamic processes involved in precipitation. For normal year conditions, average evapotranspiration and rainfall under current land use increased by 18 % and 8 %, respectively, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> central <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> whereas they slightly decreased in <b>the</b> western <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> In both flood and drought years, current land use exhibited a rainfall increase in <b>the</b> western <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and a decrease <b>over</b> <b>the</b> central <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>The</b> decrease of rainfall with increased evapotranspiration in <b>the</b> central <b>United</b> <b>States</b> was likely associated with weakening of the dynamic forcing needed to produce precipitation...|$|R

5|$|In April 1958, Eisenhower asked Congress for {{legislation}} {{to overhaul the}} Department of Defense. Over a decade had passed since the legislation which had established it, and {{he was concerned about}} the degree of inter-service rivalry, duplication and mismanagement that was evident in many programs. In ballistic missile development, the Soviet Sputnik program had demonstrated that country's technological lead <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> The Army and Air Force had rival programs, PGM-19 Jupiter and PGM-17 Thor respectively, and the additional cost to the taxpayers of developing two systems instead of one was estimated at $500million.|$|E
5|$|In June 1945, Westcott {{became an}} Army {{employee}} again, {{and in the}} post-war years he transitioned to employment with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) after its formation in 1946. In 1966 {{he was assigned to}} the AEC headquarters near Washington, DC, in Germantown, Maryland, where he worked for the AEC and its successor agencies (the Energy Research and Development Administration and Department of Energy) until retiring in 1977. He photographed nuclear power stations all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b>|$|E

Deuce N' Domino took advantage of Hardy and MVP's fight {{with each other and}} isolated Hardy. Hardy tossed MVP out of the ring and delivered a Twist of Fate to Deuce and pinned Deuce. In result, MVP and Matt Hardy retained the WWE Tag Team Title.|$|E

5|$|Murray next {{participated in}} the Rotterdam Open as the top seed, but he lost in the quarterfinals to Gilles Simon who ended a 12 match losing streak against Murray.

Afterwards, Murray played the Davis Cup World Group in Glasgow against the United States.

5|$|O'Halloran led off and put Australia in {{the lead}} with an Olympic record time of 2min 6.8s, opening a gap of 0.7s over the Soviet Union and 1.2s <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> The fourth-placed Italians were already a full three seconds in arrears. Australia never relinquished the lead and {{steadily}} increased it, as Devitt, Rose, and Henricks set the three fastest splits in the race, faster than all the non-Australian swimmers. O'Halloran's split was the fifth-fastest in the race; the Soviet anchor swimmer was the only non-Australian to swim faster, and only by 0.1s despite having {{the benefit of a}} flying start.|$|E
