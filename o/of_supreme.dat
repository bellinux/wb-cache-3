5|$|Both Buddhism and the Lingbao School {{share the}} idea of the Five Paths of Rebirth (Gati). People were reborn into earth prisons, as a hungry ghost, as an animal, as a man, or as a {{celestial}} being. After death, the body would be alchemically refined in the Palace <b>of</b> <b>Supreme</b> Darkness located in the north, and the Southern Palace in the south. The transmutation of the body consisted of two steps; the yin components of the person were refined in the Palace <b>of</b> <b>Supreme</b> Darkness, followed by the yang components in the Southern Palace. The Lingbao concept of rebirth is a Chinese adaptation of Buddhism, mixing traditional Chinese concepts with newly arrived Buddhist ideas.|$|E

On September 5, {{following the death}} of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, this nomination was withdrawn and Bush instead nominated Roberts for Chief Justice to succeed Rehnquist. Roberts was confirmed by the Senate as the 17th Chief Justice on September 29, 2005.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, a {{delegation}} <b>of</b> <b>Supreme</b> Council officers met with President Calvin Coolidge {{to share with}} him their concerns about the persecution of Catholics in Mexico during its revolution, which had considered the Church part of a corrupt establishment to be overthrown. The Order subsequently launched a $1 million campaign to educate Americans about the attacks on Catholics and the Church in the Cristero War. Twenty-five martyrs from the conflict would eventually be canonized, including six knights.|$|E
5|$|On 12 December 2008, the Icelandic {{parliament}} {{established a}} Special Investigation Commission (SIC), {{which came to}} consist <b>of</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court Justice Páll Hreinsson who served as chairman, Parliamentary Ombudsman Tryggvi Gunnarsson and Sigríður Benediktsdóttir associate chair at Yale University, to investigate the causes and lessons of the crisis.

5|$|On 13–14 November, Ferdinand of Bavaria (Ernst's brother) and the Count of Arenberg {{took the}} Elector's castle at Poppelsdorf; on 18 November, {{they moved to}} attack the Godesburg.

5|$|The ACLU took no {{official}} position on president Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1937 court-packing plan, which threatened {{to increase the}} number <b>of</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court justices, unless the Supreme Court reversed its course and began approving New Deal legislation. The Supreme Court responded by making a major shift in policy, and no longer applied strict constitutional limits to government programs, and also began to take {{a more active role in}} protecting civil liberties.|$|E
5|$|The Bill met heavy {{resistance}} in the House of Lords, as Roman Catholic bishops {{as well as the}} lay peers voted against it. They reworked much of the Bill, changed the litany to allow for a transubstantial belief in the Communion and refused to grant Elizabeth the title <b>of</b> <b>Supreme</b> Head of the Church. Parliament was prorogued over Easter, and when it resumed, the government entered two new bills into the Houses—the Act of Supremacy and the Act of Uniformity.|$|E

5|$|The House of Commons {{backed the}} {{proposals}} strongly, but {{the bill of}} supremacy met opposition in the House of Lords, particularly from the bishops. Elizabeth was fortunate that many bishoprics were vacant at the time, including the Archbishopric of Canterbury. This enabled supporters amongst peers to outvote the bishops and conservative peers. Nevertheless, Elizabeth was forced to accept the title <b>of</b> <b>Supreme</b> Governor of the Church of England rather than the more contentious title <b>of</b> <b>Supreme</b> Head, which many thought unacceptable {{for a woman to}} bear. The new Act of Supremacy became law on 8 May 1559. All public officials were to swear an oath of loyalty to the monarch as the supreme governor or risk disqualification from office; the heresy laws were repealed, to avoid a repeat of the persecution of dissenters practised by Mary. At the same time, a new Act of Uniformity was passed, which made attendance at church and the use of an adapted version of the 1552 Book of Common Prayer compulsory, though the penalties for recusancy, or failure to attend and conform, were not extreme.|$|E
5|$|All but {{a handful}} <b>of</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court justices have been married. Frank Murphy, Benjamin Cardozo, and James McReynolds were all lifelong bachelors. In addition, retired justice David Souter and current justice Elena Kagan have never been married. William O. Douglas was the first Justice to divorce while on the Court, and also had the most marriages of any Justice, with four. Justice John Paul Stevens {{divorced}} his first wife in 1979, marrying his second wife later that year. Sonia Sotomayor was the first female justice to be appointed as an unmarried woman, having divorced in 1983, long before her nomination in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Article 7 of the Indiana Constitution {{governs the}} term length <b>of</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court Justices. When {{there is a}} vacancy on the Court, a new justice is {{nominated}} using {{a variation of the}} Missouri Plan. First, the Judicial Nominating Commission submits a list of three qualified nominees to the governor. The governor then selects the new Justice from the list. If the governor fails to choose a replacement within sixty days, the chief justice or the acting chief justice must do so. The Judicial Nomination Commission Chief Justice selects the chief justice from the sitting associate justices for a five-year term. The chief justice presides over the Court. When the position of chief justice becomes vacant, the most senior member of the Court serves as the acting chief justice until a new one is chosen by the Judicial Nominating Commission. The chief justice also serves as chairman of the Judicial Nominating Commission.|$|E
5|$|As president, Zardari {{remained}} a strong U.S. {{ally in the}} war in Afghanistan, despite prevalent public disapproval of the United States following the Raymond Davis incident and the Nato attack in Salala in 2011. Domestically, Zardari achieved the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 2010, which constitutionally reduced his presidential powers. His attempt to prevent the reinstatement <b>of</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court judges failed in the face of massive protests led by his political rival Nawaz Sharif. The restored Supreme Court dismissed the PPP's elected Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani for contempt in 2012, after Gillani refused to write to the Government of Switzerland to reopen corruption cases against Zardari. Zardari's tenure was also criticised for mishandling nationwide floods in 2010, and growing terrorist violence. Following multiple bombings of Hazaras in Quetta in early 2013, Zardari dismissed his provincial government in Balochistan.|$|E

5|$|In March 2000, Zimbabwe's High Court {{ruled that}} the land invasions were illegal; they {{nevertheless}} continued, and Mugabe began vilifying Zimbabwe's judiciary. After the Supreme Court also backed this decision, the government called on its judges to resign, successfully pressuring chief justice Anthony Gubbay to do so. ZANU-PF member Godfrey Chidyausiku was appointed to replace him, while the number <b>of</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court judges was expanded from five to eight; the three additional seats went to pro-Mugabe figures. The first act of the new Supreme Court was to reverse the previous declaration that the land seizures were illegal. In November 2001, Mugabe issued a presidential decree permitting the expropriation of virtually all white-owned farms in Zimbabwe without compensation.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{is a key}} ally of the USA and UK and, {{together}} with Egypt, {{is one of only}} two Arab nations to have signed peace treaties with Israel, Jordan's direct neighbour. Jordan views an independent Palestinian state with the 1967 borders, as part of the two-state solution and <b>of</b> <b>supreme</b> national interest. The ruling Hashemite dynasty has had custodianship over holy sites in Jerusalem since 1924, a position re-inforced in the Israel–Jordan peace treaty. Turmoil in Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque between Israelis and Palestinians created tensions between Jordan and Israel concerning the former's role in protecting the Muslim and Christian sites in Jerusalem.|$|E
