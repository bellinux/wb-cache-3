40|$|Abstract. Financial {{derivatives}} are {{traded on}} <b>OTC</b> <b>markets</b> and organized exchanges. Default risks are partially shared–“mutualized”–on exchanges through a clearinghouse.

25|$|Level 1 shares {{can only}} be traded on the <b>OTC</b> <b>market</b> and the company has minimal {{reporting}} requirements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company {{is not required to}} issue quarterly or annual reports in compliance with U.S. GAAP. However, the company must have a security listed on one or more stock exchange in a foreign jurisdiction and must publish in English on its website its annual report in the form required by the laws of the country of incorporation, organization, or domicile.|$|E
25|$|Unsponsored shares {{trade on}} the {{over-the-counter}} (<b>OTC)</b> <b>market.</b> These shares are issued in accordance with market demand, and the foreign company has no formal agreement with a depositary bank. Unsponsored ADRs are often issued {{by more than one}} depositary bank. Each depositary services only the ADRs it has issued. Since the company is not formally involved in an unsponsored issue, the motivation of the company to list overseas is irrelevant for unsponsored programs. Instead, the dynamics of this market is determined by the incentive structure of three types of players: holders of the securities on-shore, the investors in depository receipts off-shore and the intermediaries (depository banks and exchanges).|$|E

40|$|In the 1990 's, Nasdaq {{experienced}} tremendous {{growth and}} established {{itself as a}} leading securities exchange. From 1990 to 2000, Nasdaq quadrupled in market capitalization from$ 321 billion in 1990 to $ 3. 6 trillion in 2000. The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 91 % since 1996, out performing the New York Stock Exchange. Currently 57 % of the public companies on the three major U. S. exchanges are listed on Nasdaq (Market Performance and Highlights, 2001). Small and medium and sized enterprises (SME) benefited from Nasdaq's multi-dealer market structure and placed the market in an advantageous position for their listings. In the 1990 's, Nasdaq played an integral role in the increased focus on technology in the United States. Asia, hoping to mirror the United States' success, has created similar over-the-counter (<b>OTC)</b> <b>markets.</b> Over the last decade, Asian countries have created Nasdaq-modeled <b>OTC</b> <b>markets</b> {{with the intention of}} increasing investment opportunities and access to capital. This study focuses on Nasdaq modeled over-the-counter markets in Asia. Compared to Nasdaq, which opened in 1971, the Asian <b>OTC</b> <b>markets</b> are relatively young. With the exception of Singapore, which opened in 1987, the Asian <b>OTC</b> <b>markets</b> were created between 1994 - 1999. Because these markets are a new development in financial markets, they are virtually unknown. The objective {{of this study is to}} present descriptive data and analysis to enhance the overall understanding of the Asian <b>OTC</b> <b>markets.</b> The study offers a comparative survey of the current market environment, and provides an overview by focusing on market summary statistics, performance and correlation.

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of modern financial markets, and the near totality of derivatives <b>markets</b> are <b>OTC</b> <b>markets</b> where bilateral contracts are exchanged between counterparties {{in the absence of}} any centralised structure. Our thesis is that to be useful, a critical perspective on modern finance should take full account of the nature of these markets, which exhibit no transparency of prices and offer little guarantee as for the efficiency of competition mechanisms. We propose to characterise the nature of <b>OTC</b> <b>markets</b> using Boltanski and Chiapello's concept (1999 / 2005) of the connexionist world. This provides, we argue, a renewed perspective on the role of innovation in modern finance. We then emphasize the difficulty of the connexionist grammar of worth to develop principles of justice in <b>OTC</b> <b>markets,</b> which are characterised by their technicality, their deterritorialization and the infinity of potential members. We suggest potential tracks to struggle more efficiently against the drifts of connexionist logic as they arise on financial markets and their spillover effects on societies...|$|R

40|$|The present article {{tries to}} put in {{perspective}} the boundary conditions, imposed by the macroeconomic constraints, which have guided the evolution of over-the-counter (<b>OTC)</b> <b>markets</b> in India and underlines {{the point that the}} process of transiting from a predominantly OTC based model to an exchange-traded model needs to follow a calibrated path. Through this transition period, the overall regulatory approach towards <b>OTC</b> derivative <b>markets</b> is as important as addressing the transactional aspects. In India, unlike the developed financial <b>markets</b> where <b>OTC</b> derivative <b>markets</b> epitomised complex, unregulated financial innovations that grew exponentially over the last two decades, the <b>OTC</b> derivative <b>markets</b> have evolved within a regulated space. The major elements of this regulatory framework include a broad specification of products to be permitted, nature of participants in the markets, distinct responsibilities for market makers and users for all OTC derivatives, effective reporting systems for capturing systemic information and focus on developing market infrastructure for post-trade clearing and settlement. Given the above context, the OTC space in India for interest rate and forex derivatives will continue to operate within a regulated manner with increased transparency. New instruments for exchanges will be introduced in a gradual manner, as hitherto. Further areas for strengthening the functioning of <b>OTC</b> <b>markets</b> will include greater standardisation of OTC derivatives and extending central clearing arrangements for such contracts where feasible. Work has already been initiated for designing a centralised trade reporting system for all OTC derivatives for better systemic oversight and market transparency. ...|$|R
