40|$|The {{leadership}} <b>of</b> <b>volunteers</b> {{offers a}} unique relationship {{in contrast to}} the leadership of waged workers, therefore, effective and appropriate leadership <b>of</b> <b>volunteers</b> is critical. While the literature offers a clear picture of the elements, including leadership discussion of the actual daily workplace practices <b>of</b> leaders <b>of</b> <b>volunteers</b> is sparse. The case studies reported here involve leaders from four not-for-profit organisations involved in human and animal welfare in an Australian metropolitan area. Each of the four leaders in this study leads a workforce made up of a large proportion <b>of</b> <b>volunteers,</b> with some waged workers. The leaders were interviewed about their backgrounds, attitudes and leadership practices in relation to <b>volunteers.</b> A number <b>of</b> the <b>volunteers</b> in each <b>of</b> the organisations were also interviewed about their perceptions of their leader’s style. Overall, these leaders display consultative leadership styles {{and a great deal of}} sensitivity to the interests and needs <b>of</b> <b>volunteers.</b> A number <b>of</b> relevant issues have emerged that accord with, and extend, the knowledge base. These include the attitudes <b>of</b> leaders and <b>volunteers</b> towards the education and training <b>of</b> <b>volunteers,</b> leaders’ perceptions <b>of</b> the importance to <b>volunteers</b> <b>of</b> the social and relational aspects of their time in the organisation and desire for input into and flexibility in their roles. Issues of retention and performance, and the potential for mentoring in the leadership and development <b>of</b> <b>volunteers</b> also emerged. Another outcome relates to some perceived negative attitudes on the part of paid employees towards volunteers in their organisations and the implications of this for the social capital and capacity building within the organisations. Important practical elements in the leadership <b>of</b> <b>volunteers</b> are outlined and areas for further research are suggested...|$|R

40|$|Crowdsourcing is {{a popular}} means of {{acquiring}} data, {{but the use of}} such data is limited by concerns with its quality. This is evident within cartography and geographical sciences more generally, with the quality <b>of</b> <b>volunteered</b> geographic information (VGI) recognized as a major challenge to address if the full potential of citizen sensing in mapping applications is to be realized. Here, a means to characterize the quality <b>of</b> <b>volunteers,</b> based only on the data they contribute, was used to explore issues connected with the quantity and quality <b>of</b> <b>volunteers</b> for attribute mapping. The focus was on data in the form of annotations or class labels provided by volunteers who visually interpreted an attribute, land cover, from a series of satellite sensor images. A latent class model was found to be able to provide accurate characterisations of the quality <b>of</b> <b>volunteers</b> in terms <b>of</b> the accuracy of their labelling, irrespective of the number of cases that they labelled. The accuracy with which a volunteer could be characterized tended to increase with the number <b>of</b> <b>volunteers</b> contributing but was typically good at all but small numbers <b>of</b> <b>volunteers.</b> Moreover, the ability to characterize <b>volunteers</b> in terms <b>of</b> the quality of their labelling could be used constructively. For example, volunteers could be ranked in terms of quality which could then be used to select a sub-set as input to a subsequent mapping task. This was particularly important as an identified subset <b>of</b> <b>volunteers</b> could undertake a task more accurately than when part of a larger group <b>of</b> <b>volunteers.</b> The results highlight that both the quantity and quality <b>of</b> <b>volunteers</b> need consideration and that the use of VGI may be enhanced through information on the quality <b>of</b> the <b>volunteers</b> derived entirely from the data provided without any additional information...|$|R
