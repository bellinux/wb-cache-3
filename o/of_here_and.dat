5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out <b>of</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E

25|$|Besides Klaws, all ten finalists {{with the}} {{exception}} of then-pregnant Andrea Josten signed record deals with various record companies. Runner-up Juliette Schoppmann also signed with BMG, but in contrast to public expectations she declined working with Bohlen. Instead, she released three singles of which two entered the top ten and a solo album, Unique, which eventually debuted in 2004. Due to moderate sales BMG dropped her shortly after its release. She has since made herself a name as professional songwriter. Third-placed Daniel Küblböck also expanded his nationwide but extremely polarising popularity with a contract with BMG. Until June 2004 he released four major succeeded hit singles and a number-one album, titled Positive Energien (2003). However, further efforts failed on the charts after a controversial participations in the German versions of I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out <b>of</b> <b>Here!</b> <b>and</b> Big Brother and the release of his flopped motion picture Daniel – Der Zauberer (2004).|$|E
500|$|In New Mexico's {{motion to}} {{renumber}} the highway, they selected U.S. Route393. Since the route came nowhere near US93, AASHTO instead suggested US491, noting it as {{a branch of}} US191 at Monticello, Utah. Although the next three-digit child of US91 would have been U.S. Route291, both the 291 and 391 designations were already in use as state route numbers {{in at least one}} of the affected states. At the news that the motion had passed, a New Mexico spokesperson stated, [...] "The devil's out <b>of</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> we say goodbye and good riddance." [...] Referring to the motion passing with a different number from what New Mexico requested, another spokesperson responded, [...] "As long as it's not 666 and it's nothing satanic, that's OK." [...] US666 officially ceased to exist on May 31, 2003, although temporary [...] "New 491– Old666" [...] signs were posted after the change to aid travelers using old maps.|$|E

2500|$|Doug Moon {{left the}} band {{because of his}} dislike of the band's {{increasing}} experimentation outside his preferred blues genre. Ry Cooder told of Moon's becoming so angered by Van Vliet's unrelenting criticism that {{he walked into the}} room pointing a loaded crossbow at him, only to have Van Vliet tell him, [...] "Get that fucking thing out of here, get out <b>of</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> get back in your room", which he did. (Other band members dispute this account, though Moon is likely to have [...] "passed through" [...] the studio with a weapon.) Moon was present during the early demo sessions at Original Sound studio, above the Kama Sutra/Buddah offices. The works Moon laid down did not see the light of day, as he was replaced by Cooder when they continued on material at Sunset Sound with Marker. Marker then fell by the wayside when recording was moved by Krasnow and Perry to RCA Studio. This would {{have a profound effect on}} the quality of the Safe as Milk work, as the former studio was 8-track and the subsequent studio a 4-track.|$|E
2500|$|The Orlando Magic drafted O'Neal {{with the}} 1st overall {{pick in the}} 1992 NBA draft. During that summer, prior to moving to Orlando, he spent a {{significant}} amount of time in Los Angeles under the tutelage of Hall of Famer Magic Johnson. Given Terry Catledge eventually refused to give O'Neal the 33 jersey, he relented by going back to the 32 from his high school days. O'Neal was named the Player of the Week in his first week in the NBA, becoming the first player to do so. During his rookie season, O'Neal averaged 23.4 points on 56.2% shooting, 13.9 rebounds, and 3.5 blocks per game for the season. He was named the 1993 NBA Rookie of the Year and became the first rookie to be voted an All-Star starter since Michael Jordan in 1985. The Magic finished 41–41, winning 20 more games than the previous season; however, the team ultimately missed the playoffs by virtue of a tie-breaker with the Indiana Pacers. On more than one occasion during the year, Sports Illustrated writer Jack McCallum overheard O'Neal saying, [...] "We've got to get [...] Matty [...] out <b>of</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> bring in [...] Brian [...]" ...|$|E
