There {{was once a}} ferry at this point, before 1865, which gave access to the Victoria Dock, opened in 1850.

5|$|Because {{of their}} great size, supertankers often cannot enter port fully loaded. These ships {{can take on}} their cargo at {{off-shore}} platforms and single-point moorings. On the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the journey, they often pump their cargo off to smaller tankers at designated lightering points off-coast. A supertanker's routes are generally long, requiring it to stay at sea for extended periods, up to and beyond seventy days at a time.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{realized}} that wooden buildings could {{be protected from}} lightning strikes, and the deadly fires that often resulted, by placing a pointed iron on a rooftop, with the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the rod placed deep into the ground. The sharp point of the lightning rod would attract the electrical discharge from the cloud, and the lightning bolt would hit the iron rod instead of the wooden building. The electric charge from the lightning would flow through the rod directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{thatched}} {{houses in}} Little Thetford {{was destroyed by}} fire. Reported in the Cambridge Chronicle 6 November 1930, {{the cause of the}} fire at the c.13th-century six-room building was not known. Fireworks were being discharged at the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the village. All that remained were burnt beams and smouldering walls, which were apparently made of old fen-mud. The villagers saved the nearby Three Horseshoes public house, by forming a bucket chain, and pouring water on its thatched roof.|$|E

5|$|The fight {{began with}} a {{flagrant}} foul by Knicks guard Mardy Collins on Nuggets guard J. R. Smith in the closing seconds of the game. Several players joined in the confrontation, and began to make physical contact. The fight briefly spilled into the stands, and also stretched to the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the court.

When suspensions were announced, seven players were suspended without pay for a combined total of 47 games.|$|E

5|$|Ajax {{opened the}} scoring {{in the third}} minute when Cees de Wolf, who was making his debut for Ajax, scored. A throw-in by Cruyff was headed into the air, Liverpool goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence came to collect the ball. Realising he could not reach it, he moved back towards his goal, but de Wolf outjumped defender Chris Lawler to head {{the ball into the}} Liverpool goal. The {{conditions}} were so poor, that the crowd celebrated in stages. Those closest to the goal celebrated immediately, while those at the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the stadium reacted to these celebrations. Liverpool striker Hunt had a chance to score in the 12th minute, but his shot was saved by Ajax goalkeeper Gert Bals. Following the goal Ajax continued to attack, midfielder Sjaak Swart ran past three Liverpool players before passing the ball to Klaas Nuninga, whose shot was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Lawrence. However, Lawrence dropped the ball near Johan Cruyff, who scored to give Ajax a 2â€“0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{inhabit the}} tropics, {{as well as}} {{temperate}} and boreal waters. A number of species can survive and even flourish in extreme conditions. They are abundant in the Arctic, about 140 species being known from that zone. The Antarctic scallop, Adamussium colbecki, lives under the sea ice at the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the globe, where the subzero temperatures mean that growth rates are very slow. The giant mussel, Bathymodiolus thermophilus, and the giant white clam, Calyptogena magnifica, both live clustered around hydrothermal vents at abyssal depths in the Pacific Ocean. They have chemosymbiotic bacteria in their gills that oxidise hydrogen sulphide, and the molluscs absorb nutrients synthesized by these bacteria. The saddle oyster, Enigmonia aenigmatica, is a marine species {{that could be considered}} amphibious. It lives above the high tide mark in the tropical Indo-Pacific on the underside of mangrove leaves, on mangrove branches, and on sea walls in the splash zone.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} science, {{an anonymous}} pipe is a simplex FIFO communication channel {{that may be}} used for one-way interprocess communication (IPC). An implementation is often integrated into the operating system's file IO subsystem.

5|$|Chinook Pass is {{the border}} between Pierce and Yakima {{counties}} and Mount Rainier National Park and the Wenatchee National Forest. The pass is also where the highway crosses the Pacific Crest Trail, a National Scenic Trail that was completed in 1993. East of Chinook Pass, the roadway begins to parallel the American River northeast to follow the Little Naches River, which becomes the Naches River. After a junction with the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the proposed SR168, named Little Naches Road, the highway exits the Wenatchee National Forest and enters Naches. The byway ends at US12 in Naches near the Naches Selah Canal.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} Thompson took control until {{shortly after the}} Second World War, the News-Miner lacked a {{dedicated}} connection to the Associated Press. In {{the early years of}} the Thompson administration, he had a dedicated correspondent in Seattle whose job was to read the early editions of the Seattle newspapers, then hurry to the telegraph office and summarize what he had read to Thompson on the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the telegraph cable. This system later was replaced by a dedicated contract with the Alaska Communications System, but that contract limited the News-Miner to no more than 9,000 words per day of messages.|$|E
5|$|Gordon escapes the {{destroyed}} lab. Surviving staff {{tell him}} that communications {{with the outside world}} have been cut and urge him to head to the surface. Gordon fights his way through Black Mesa, defending himself against hostile Xen creatures â€” such as Vortigaunts and parasitic headcrabs, which attach themselves to human hosts â€” and US marines sent to cover up the incident. At the surface, Gordon learns that scientists from the Lambda Complex may have a way to close the portal. Gordon travels to the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the facility to assist them. Along the way, he activates a rocket engine test facility to destroy a giant tentacled creature and uses a disused railway system to reach and launch a satellite rocket. After he is captured by Black Ops and left for dead in a garbage compactor, he escapes and makes his way to an older part of the facility, where he discovers Xen specimens collected before the resonance cascade.|$|E

5|$|Many {{tropical}} cyclones develop {{when the}} atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance {{in the atmosphere}} are favorable. Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics. Tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere; if the conditions remain favorable, the tropical disturbance intensifies, and can even develop an eye. On the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the spectrum, if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses. A tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E
