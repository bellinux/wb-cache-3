5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E
5|$|Marshmallow fluff, {{one of the}} {{two main}} {{ingredients}} of a Fluffernutter, was invented in the early 20th century. Archibald Query invented a creation he called Marshmallow Creme in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1917, while Amory and Emma Curtis of Melrose, Massachusetts, invented Snowflake Marshmallow Creme in 1913. During World War I, Emma Curtis published a recipe for the Liberty Sandwich, which consisted <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> and Snowflake Marshmallow Creme on oat or barley bread. The recipe was published in a promotional booklet sent to Curtis' customers in 1918 and may be the origin of the Fluffernutter sandwich. Earlier labels and booklets published by the Curtises suggested combining Snow Flake Marshmallow Creme with peanut butter or eating it on sandwiches with chopped nuts or olives.|$|E

500|$|After {{his release}} from captivity in 1953, Misch {{returned}} to what was then West Berlin. He arrived home on New Year's Eve 1953 to the house which was [...] from the Führerbunker. At the time, Misch's wife worked as a teacher in Neukölln. Misch struggled for several years with {{what to do with}} his life after captivity. He was offered various odd jobs, among others as a porter in a hospital and as a driver. Most of these job offers were through his wartime contacts, and required moving away from Berlin, which his wife refused to do. He finally obtained a loan backed by wealthy German philanthropists to buy out a painting and interior decorating shop from a retiree in Berlin. He ran this modest business successfully, and during the early Allied occupation of Berlin also became involved in the making <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> for American troops. The business had been started by Misch's old friend, Adolf Kleinholdermann. This sideline business became so successful that Misch considered leaving his shop. His wife convinced him to remain in the painting and interior decorating business. In 1975, Gerda was elected to the parliament of West Berlin in which she served for several years. Years later Gerda developed Alzheimer's and died in 1998. Misch continued to manage his shop until his retirement at age 68 in 1985. [...] His memoir in German, Der letzte Zeuge (The Last Witness), was published in 2008. The English edition was published in 2014 with an introduction by historian Roger Moorhouse.|$|E

2500|$|The term noun has a {{narrower}} purview and is detached from {{any notion of}} entity description. For instance, the words bit/bits {{in a bit of}} time, a little bit <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> <b>butter,</b> and bits of information can be understood as a noun, but they can hardly be understood as representing some entity on its own. In that sense, these words shall be understood as being the head of a [...] "noun phrase" [...] in a formalist account of grammar, but as a portion of some unbounded entity in a nominal group. Since formal linguists are interested in the recurring patterns of word classes such as [...] "a" [...] + [...] "" [...] and not in the way humans describe entities, they recruit the term [...] "noun phrase" [...] for their grammatical descriptions, a structure defined as a pattern around a noun, and not as a way of describing an entity such as the [...] "nominal group". In other words, given the different architectures of language that are assumed by functional and formal theories of language, the terms [...] "noun phrase" [...] and [...] "nominal group" [...] must be seen to be doing quite different descriptive work.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Mitchell — Age 32, [...] Dennis' {{father is}} a workaday {{aerospace}} engineer. Henry seems to understand Dennis more than his wife does, especially in affairs of the heart.

[...] Another time, while Dennis was watching Gina, he confided to his dad, [...] "There's somethin' about Gina that I can't figger out." [...] Henry wisely advised his son, [...] "Wait." [...] Again, Henry and Alice overhear Dennis tell Gina that she [...] "smelled better than a plateful <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> samwiches". Henry remarks, [...] "The ultimate compliment." [...] Like his creator Hank Ketcham, Henry served in the US Navy; his position was [...] as a quartermaster (Helmsman) 2nd class on a battleship. Sometimes, he and Alice will get into arguments (which even show his chauvinistic side at times); however, they remain devoted to each other. Among his hobbies are golf, taking naps, fishing, and playing the ukulele and singing old songs with George Wilson. A running gag is that Henry often plays the straight man dupe — either resulting from Dennis's pranks, or because of his own foolishness; once he tried to save money on a Christmas tree by cutting one down in the country — and ended up paying $20.00 ($10.00 for a fine and $10.00 for the owner charging him for the tree).|$|E
