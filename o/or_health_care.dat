25|$|A {{music therapy}} degree {{candidate}} can earn an undergraduate, master's or doctoral degree in music therapy. Many AMTA approved programs offer equivalency and certificate degrees in music therapy for students that have completed {{a degree in}} a related field. Some practicing music therapists have held PhDs in fields other than, but usually related to, music therapy. Recently, Temple University established a PhD program in music therapy. A music therapist typically incorporates music therapy techniques with broader clinical practices such as psychotherapy, rehabilitation, and other practices depending on client needs. Music therapy services rendered {{within the context of}} a social service, educational, <b>or</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> agency are often reimbursable by insurance and sources of funding for individuals with certain needs. Music therapy services have been identified as reimbursable under Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance plans and federal and state government programs.|$|E
25|$|The Communist Party came {{to power}} in the late 1940s and instituted a command economy. In 1958, Mao Zedong, the Chairman of the Communist Party of China, created a {{residency}} permit system defining where people could work, and classified workers as rural or urban. In this system, a worker seeking to move from the country to an urban area to take up non-agricultural work would have to apply through the relevant bureaucratic institutions. There is uncertainty, however, over how strictly the system has been enforced. People who worked outside the region in which they were registered would not qualify for grain rations, employer-provided housing, <b>or</b> <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> There were controls over education, employment, marriage and other areas of life. One reason cited for instituting this system was to prevent the possible chaos caused by predictable large-scale urbanization. As a part of the one country, two systems policy proposed by Deng Xiaoping and accepted by the British and Portuguese governments, the special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau retained separate border control and immigration policies {{with the rest of the}} PRC. Chinese nationals had to gain permission from the government before travelling to Hong Kong or Macau, but this requirement was officially abolished for each SAR after its respective handover. Since then, restrictions imposed by the SAR governments have been the limiting factor on travel.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{landmark}} 1976 California case of Landeros v. Flood, the California Supreme Court remanded {{a case to}} the trial court for action in tort against a treating physician for failure to report suspected child abuse. [...] The theory at trial was that the plaintiff, a child of about 12 months of age, had been returned to a home where further physical abuse occurred, causing more damages. [...] This was because the physician had failed to report the abuse in violation of California law. [...] After this case, all states instituted mandatory reporting by physicians and other medical personnel of any suspected child abuse or neglect cases. In general, reporting in good faith shields the physician <b>or</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> worker from tort liability. Reporting to police or social services necessitates obtaining medical records by subpoena duces tecum. This case, and legislation that followed it were in response to several articles {{that appeared in the}} medical literature that defined battered child syndrome and child abuse syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|Depending on {{the source}} and ingredients, there are various {{ways in which the}} public can dispose of {{pharmaceutical}} and personal care products. In the case of pharmaceutical products, the most environmentally safe disposal method is {{to take advantage of a}} community drug take-back programs that collect drugs at a central location for proper disposal. [...] Several local public health departments in the United States have initiated pharmaceutical take-back programs. In addition, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) periodically promotes local take-back programs as well as a program called the National Take Back Initiative. Currently, take back programs are funded by state or local health departments or are volunteer programs through pharmacies <b>or</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> providers. In recent years, the proposition that pharmaceutical companies should be responsible for their products âfrom the cradle to the grave,â has been gaining traction. [...] This philosophy suggests that the manufacturers should fund the proper disposal of pharmaceutical products. Take back programs should exist in every community, and if further information is required on the matter the city officials should be contacted. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Office of National Drug Control Policy further emphasize that if no program is available to follow the subsequent measurements: ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{countries}} provide {{publicly funded}} retirement <b>or</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> systems. In connection with these systems, the country typically requires employers and/or employees to make compulsory payments. These payments are often computed {{by reference to}} wages or earnings from self-employment. Tax rates are generally fixed, but a different rate may be imposed on employers than on employees. Some systems provide an upper limit on earnings subject to the tax. A few systems provide that the tax is payable only on wages above a particular amount. Such upper or lower limits may apply for retirement but not health care components of the tax. Some have argued that such taxes on wages are a form of [...] "forced savings" [...] and not really a tax, while others point to redistribution through such systems between generations (from newer cohorts to older cohorts) and across income levels (from higher income levels to lower income levels) which suggest that such programs are really tax and spending programs. Some tax scholars argue that supporting social security programs exclusively through taxes on wages, rather than through broader taxes that include capital, creates distortions and underinvestment in human capital, since the returns to such investments will be taxes as wages.|$|E
