40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new evidence}} about wage stickiness {{and the nature}} <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> setting. We use a unique micro dataset on monthly frequency, covering wages in the Icelandic private sector for the period from 1998 - 2010, and draw the following conclusions. First, the mean frequency <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> change is 10. 8 % per month. When weighted for heterogeneity across industries and occupations the result is almost identical; the frequency of change is 10. 5 % per month. Second, only 0. 5 % <b>of</b> monthly <b>wage</b> changes are decreases. Third, the mean duration <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> spells is 8. 9 months. Onefifth <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> spells last longer than a year while other spells last for one year or shorter. Fourth, wage setting displays strong features of time-dependence: half <b>of</b> all <b>wage</b> changes are synchronised in January, but other adjustments are staggered through the year. Fifth, there is limited evidence of state-dependence: frequency <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> increases, size <b>of</b> increases, frequency <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> decreases and size of decreases do not correlate with inflation. However, both frequency and size <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> decreases have significant correlation with unemployment. Sixth, the hazard function for wages is mostly flat during the first months but has a large twelve-month spike. These facts align with a model <b>of</b> time-dependent <b>wage</b> contracts <b>of</b> fixed duration. ...|$|R

Illustrative of this was Cantillon's influence on Say, which is noticeable in the methodology employed in the latter's Treatise on Political Economy.|$|E

Moreover, we study how firms reacted differently along the cycle, depending on their historical level <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> rigidity. In particular, we seek to answer whether firms which were structurally less able to adjust <b>wages</b> <b>of</b> job stayers reacted by adjusting employment more and whether these firms, by hiring new workers at a re-negotiated salary which corresponds more to the new cyclical conditions, managed to partially compress their average wage per employee, even {{in the presence of}} high levels <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> rigidity for stayers.|$|R
5|$|Webster {{herself was}} characterised as malicious, {{reckless}} and wilfully evil. Commentators saw her crime as both gruesome and scandalous.

At the time, about 40% of the female labour force was employed as domestic servants for a very wide range of society, from the wealthiest to respectable working-class families. Servants and employers lived and worked in close proximity, and the honesty and orderliness of servants was a constant cause of concern. Servants were very poorly paid and larceny was an ever-present temptation.

5|$|Alfonsín kept a {{regulation}} from the dictatorship {{that allowed him}} to regulate the level <b>of</b> <b>wages.</b> He authorized wage increases every three months, to keep them up to the inflation rate. The CGT rejected this, and proposed instead that wages be determined by free negotiations. Alfonsín allowed strike actions, which were forbidden during the dictatorship, which gave the unions another way to expand their influence. There were thirteen general strikes and thousands of minor labor conflicts. However, unlike similar situations in the past, the CGT sided with Alfonsín during the military rebellions, and did not support the removal of a non-Peronist president. The conflicts were caused by high inflation, and the unions requested higher wages in response to it. The unions got the support of the non-unionized retirees, the church and left-wing factions. Popular support for the government allowed it to endure in spite of opposition from the unions.|$|E

30|$|It {{is worth}} {{looking at the}} main {{findings}} of some previous studies, irrespective of the measure <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> rigidity/flexibility adopted, because the same factors may affect the degree <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> rigidity, whether nominal or real. 1 First, cross-country analyses have highlighted the role of labour market institutions, such as unionisation, centralisation, coordination and coverage <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> bargaining. Using a cross-country analysis, Dickens et al. (2007 b) show that unionisation and collective bargaining coverage at the country level are positively related to wage rigidity. The results in Clar et al. (2007) indicate that union density, centralisation <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> bargaining and employment protection legislation are negatively related to real <b>wage</b> flexibility. Coordination <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> bargaining, which allows for internalisation of the effects <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> changes on the economy, makes wages more responsive to labour market conditions and therefore increases real wage flexibility. Using industry-level data, Holden and Wulfsberg (2008) find that downward nominal wage rigidity is higher in countries where employment protection legislation is stricter, union density higher and unemployment lower.|$|R

5|$|For {{much of its}} {{existence}} the Court was formally led by the Lord Chancellor, assisted by the judges of the common law courts.

In 1813 a Vice-Chancellor was appointed to deal with the Chancery's increasing backlogs, and two more were appointed in 1841. Offices of the Chancery were sold by the Lord Chancellor for much of its history, raising large amounts of money. Many of the clerks and other officials were sinecures who, in lieu <b>of</b> <b>wages,</b> charged increasingly exorbitant fees to process cases, {{one of the main reasons}} why the cost of bringing a case to the Chancery was so high. The 19th century saw the abolition of many sinecure offices and the institution of a wage and pension for the Lord Chancellor to curb the sale of offices, and later the right to appoint officials was transferred from the Chancellor to the Crown.|$|E

Edna was pregnant with a second child, although she expected to never see her husband again; Kenyatta was aware that if they joined him in Kenya their lives would be made very difficult by the colony's racial laws. On his arrival in Mombasa, Kenyatta was greeted by his first wife and their children. He built a bungalow at Gatundu, near {{to where he was}} born, and began farming his 32-acre estate. Kenyata met with the new Governor of Kenya, Philip Euen Mitchell, and in March 1947 accepted a post on an African Land Settlement Board, holding the post for two years. He also met with Mbiyu Koinange to discuss the future of the Koinange Independent Teachers' College in Githungui, with Koinange appointing Kenyatta as its Vice-Principal. In May 1947, Koinange moved to England, leaving Kenyatta to take full control of the college. Under Kenyatta's leadership, additional funds were raised for the construction of school buildings and the number of boys in attendance rose from 250 to 900. It was also beset with problems, including a decline in standards and teachers' strikes over non-payment <b>of</b> <b>wages.</b> Gradually, the number of enrolled pupils fell.
