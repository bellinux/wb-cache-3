The equations describe heat transfer inside the drying cylinder are highly non linear {{and therefore the}} mathematical models used to simulate the drying process are complicated. Here we suggest fuzzy and neurofuzzy techniques to control the drying procedure. A fuzzy controller is designed based on available expertise, while a neuro-fuzzy controller is built using the Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) based on experimental data. Both controllers tested in various operation conditions and extensive comparative results are presented.

40|$|To {{help the}} {{interpretation}} of possible olive processing residues at archaeological sites, this study examines the changes which occur in pre- and post-charring breakage surfaces of <b>olive</b> <b>stones</b> at tissue level. Fresh olives were experimentally broken before and after charring and heated to different temperatures (230, 330, 430 A degrees C) in oxidising and non-oxidising conditions. The structures obtained by the experiment were studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the characteristics for the different temperatures, oxidation regimes and pre- or post-charring fractures were recorded. Furthermore, the experimental specimens were compared with recent and possibly old fractures of several archaeological <b>olive</b> <b>stones</b> from Tell Tweini, Syria. Criteria to infer their formation are discussed. These criteria could be developed further through more experimental replication and additional charring variables, and verified extensively on archaeobotanical assemblages in future studies. The described structures and alterations in the <b>olive</b> <b>stones</b> can be observed using reflected light microscopy, which would allow the proposed approach to be rather easy to apply in practice...|$|R

In order to improve knowledge on <b>olive</b> <b>stones,</b> the phenolic compounds concentration of three varieties of Moroccan olive trees: Moroccan Picholine, Menara and Haouzian were studied. <b>Olive</b> <b>stones</b> of three varieties were characterized by Fourier Transform Mid Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-MIR). Total phenolic compounds are quantified after solid-liquid extraction by an assay of Folin-Ciocalteu. Moroccan Picholine stones (11. 32 mg GAE/g DM) have a higher content of total phenolic compounds than Haouzia stones (4. 55 mg GAE/g DM) and Menara stones (3. 56 mg GAE/g DM). Thermogravimetric analysis indicates that up to 195 Â°C; there is no degradation of the stones. The biocide performance on agar-agar was tested with decay fungi.

A commercial resin was used as unsaturated polyester and pressed <b>olive</b> <b>stones,</b> which are an agricultural by-product, talc and quartz in different concentrations were used as fillers. The viscosity versus time at different temperatures was recorded and the gel time (G) was determined by the sharp increase of viscosity, which involves the beginning of the crosslinking reaction. DSC records the exothermic peak due to the double bonds breaking to give crosslinked macromolecules. The results of both methods were treated kinetically. The activation energy E-v and the pre-exponential factor A' from the rheological method remained almost constant in the case of talc and quartz compared with the neat unsaturated polyester.

40|$|This article {{describes}} an experimental study on ash deposition during the co-firing of bituminous coal with pine sawdust and <b>olive</b> <b>stones</b> {{in a laboratory}} furnace. The main objective {{of this study was}} to relate the ash deposit rates with the type of biomass burned and its thermal percentage in the blend. The thermal percentage of biomass in the blend was varied between 10 % and 50 % for both sawdust and <b>olive</b> <b>stones.</b> For comparison purposes, tests have also been performed using only coal or only biomass. During the tests, deposits were collected with the aid of an air-cooled deposition probe placed far from the flame region, where the mean gas temperature was around 640 degrees C. A number of deposit samples were subsequently analyzed on a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray detector. Results indicate that blending sawdust with coal decreases the deposition rate as compared with the firing of unblended coal due to both the sawdust low ash content and its low alkalis content. The co-firing of coal and sawdust yields deposits with high levels of silicon and aluminium which indicates the presence of ashes with high fusion temperature and, thus, with less capacity to adhere to the surfaces. In contrast, in the co-firing of coal with <b>olive</b> <b>stones</b> the deposition rate increases as compared with the firing of unblended coal and the deposits produced present high levels of potassium, which tend to increase their stickiness...|$|R

The most important weight loss, shrinkage and structural changes of pyrolyzed composites are observed at temperatures up to 600 degreesC due to the <b>olive</b> <b>stone</b> component.

40|$|A {{by-product}} from {{olive oil}} production, <b>olive</b> <b>stone,</b> was investigated {{for the removal}} of Cd (II), Cr (III) and Pb (II) from aqueous solutions. The kinetics of biosorption are studied, analyzing the effect of the initial concentration of metal and temperature. Pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich and intraparticle diffusion models have been used to represent the kinetics of the process and obtain the main kinetic parameters. The results show that the pseudo-second order model is the one that best describes the biosorption of the three metal ions for all the range of experimental conditions investigated. For the three metal ions, the maximum biosoption capacity and the initial biosorption rate increase when the initial metal concentration rises. However, the kinetic constant decreases when the initial metal concentration increases. The temperature effect on biosorption capacity for Cd (II) and Cr (III) is less significant; however, for Pb (II) the effect of temperature is more important, especially when temperature rises from 25 to 40 ??C.

C 1 was found to contain mainly mesopores and only a few micropores; this is the reason it adsorbed methylene blue but did not practically adsorb from the vapour phase. C 2, C 3 and C 4 contained more micropores (C 2 < C 3 < C 4) but they also contained mesopores, and as a consequence they had the ability to adsorb from both the vapour and the liquid phase (aqueous solution of methylene blue). The activated material C 4 shows better pore characteristics than the commercial product C 5. These results show that the properties of the pyrolyzed composite material are superior to those of the pyrolyzed biomass. It is thus possible to obtain activated carbons with the pore structure and sorption properties desired for the application for which they are destined. Â© 1995...|$|E

Among the samples studied, aminated almond shells were selected as the most promising adsorbent, due to their high CO 2 adsorption capacity and selectivity and their good adsorption kinetics. To assess the performance of these samples in cyclic adsorption/desorption processes, basic two-step cycle configurations were evaluated by the following regeneration strategies: temperature swing adsorption (TSA), vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) and a combination of both (VTSA). Aminated almond shells showed no sign of deactivation after 13 h of continuous TSA cycling between 303 and 373 K, nor during VSA or VTSA cycling.
