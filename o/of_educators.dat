Managing educator misconduct in township schools is a research project which investigates the nature <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> misconduct in township schools {{and its impact on}} school management. It also investigates how educator misconduct is managed in these schools and provides guidelines to alleviate the problem <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> misconduct in township schools. Therefore, the research question was: "What are the nature and consequences <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> misconduct in township schools and how should educator misconduct be managed?" The aims were to identify, describe and discuss the nature and consequences <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> misconduct~ to understand the role of stakeholders in the management <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> misconduct~ and to discuss guidelines for managing educator misconduct. A qualitative research strategy was used in this research project. A literature study was conducted before and during this research project in order to provide a theoretical background to this research project. Data were collected through individual in-depth and focus group interviews with the principals and <b>educators</b> <b>of</b> three township secondary schools. Interview data were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim and analysed using the constant comparative method. Four themes emerged from data analysis. The first theme is common types <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> misconduct. This includes absenteeism and tardiness, where educators absent themselves from school without giving valid reasons and also go late to classes~ insubordination or a lack of respect for the principal's authority and using corporal punishment regardless {{of the fact that it}} has been legally banned. The second theme is the awareness <b>of</b> regulations regulating <b>educator</b> misconduct. In this theme it was revealed that educators and principals are aware of the Education Department policies on educator misconduct and the SACE code <b>of</b> ethics for <b>educators,</b> but disregard them nonetheless. The third theme viz. the effect <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> misconduct on schools, revealed that learners are adversely affected by educator misconduct since educators do not spend most of the time teaching them in classes. This theme also revealed that other educators are negatively affected by the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> misconduct in their schools and that the whole school image is also tainted. The fourth theme discussed how educator misconduct is managed in township schools. This includes the procedures used by principals in dealing with cases <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> misconduct; the role played by the Department of Education in helping the principals deal with educator misconduct; the role of the school governing bodies and the role of the parents. Based on the literature and interview data, the research concludes by making a number of recommendations as to how principals can reduce the problem <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> misconduct in schools...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 During {{the past}} {{number of years}} the press in Namibia has been {{regularly}} publishing reports linking educators to some unacceptable conduct. The apparent increase in the frequency <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> misconduct coupled with relevant research in education law prompted this research to be carried out. Recent research shows that good labour relations promote mutual respect between employer and employee. In education, the good labour relations help to promote {{the achievement of the}} national goals on education. The aim of this research was to determine the nature and frequency <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> misconduct in public or government schools in Namibia. The research was also conducted to establish the extent to which educator misconduct affected learning and teaching in the schools as well as the effects on the well-being of the learners and other stakeholders in education. It was also aimed in this research to analyse the respective roles of those individuals, organisations or bodies, such as teacher unions, who are responsible for the management <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> misconduct. The findings from the review of policy documents, text books, journal articles and newspaper articles and the empirical research pointed out a high frequency <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> misconduct. Participants recommended that the supervisors and the employers have to do much more to curb the upsurge <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> misconduct. Educator misconduct was blamed for harmful effects to the learning and teaching of learners, as well as the wellbeing of other stakeholders. The research revealed that legislation {{plays an important role in}} the management <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> misconduct. Being consistent with the guidelines from legislation, jurisprudence and the common law regarding management <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> misconduct was established to be essential to ensure fairness to both learners and educators.

This perspective teaches adolescents that boys are predators and that girls are victims of sexual victimization.

In reality, sexual violence can be very prevalent within marriages too.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the issue <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> {{power in the}} classroom and suggests a practical mechanism by which educators can reflect on their power use and develop a deeper consciousness of it in their teaching. A review of the literature conducted for this study revealed a gap in the discussion <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> power between the theoretical and practice-oriented literature bases. This study considers whether a comparable gap exists in actual practice and through phenomenological interviews investigates the perceptions of classroom power use for ten faculty in higher education. Through classroom observations, these perceptions are compared to classroom practices for all participants and gaps are seen for all ten participants. ^ The theoretical frame of analysis for this study is drawn from the review of the educational literature including critical and feminist pedagogy, multicultural, social justice, humanistic, and teacher education, as well as faculty development and self awareness literatures. The examination of this literature highlights the areas <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> power presently underinvestigated in both theory and practice. Specifically, this review lead to the development of two models for understanding educator power: the Spheres <b>of</b> <b>Educator</b> Power and the Sites <b>of</b> <b>Educator</b> Power. The Spheres model is an organizational schema that groups educator power into three primary ‘spheres’, Public, Private and Intimate, with the bulk of the literature addressing the Public and the Private leaving the Intimate significantly underinvestigated. The Sites model further explores the Intimate Sphere and identifies seven fundamental sites <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> power in the classroom—social identity, teacher education programs, educational biography, personal history, content mastery, student abdication, and institutional conferrence. ^ These two frames for understanding educator power, combined with the interview and observational results, are the foundation of an action—reflection model, the Power Praxis model, designed to assist educators in becoming more conscious of their use of power in the classroom. Rooted in the aforementioned literatures, it is believed that a deeper awareness of the use <b>of</b> <b>educator</b> power in the classroom {{as a result of this}} model will lead to a more empowering educational experience for both students and educators. ...|$|R
