5|$|Seamounts provide {{habitats}} and spawning grounds for these larger animals, including numerous fish. Some species, including black oreo (Allocyttus niger) and blackstripe cardinalfish (Apogon nigrofasciatus), {{have been shown}} to occur more often on seamounts than anywhere else <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor.</b> Marine mammals, sharks, tuna, and cephalopods all congregate over seamounts to feed, as well as some species of seabirds when the features are particularly shallow.|$|E
5|$|Frauenlob {{spent her}} entire {{career in the}} {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet. She saw action during World War I at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914, where she badly damaged the British cruiser , and at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916. There, in a chaotic night engagement, Frauenlob {{was hit by a}} torpedo launched by , which caused the ship to capsize and sink with the vast majority of her crew. The wreck was discovered in 2000, and is in remarkably good condition, sitting upright <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E

50|$|During the 1950s and 1960s {{information}} about {{variations in the}} Earth's magnetic field was gathered largely by means of research vessels. But the complex routes of <b>ocean</b> cruises rendered <b>the</b> association of navigational data with magnetometer readings difficult. Only when data were plotted on a map did it become apparent that remarkably regular and continuous magnetic stripes appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R
5|$|Most young {{octopuses}} hatch as paralarvae and are planktonic {{for weeks}} to months, {{depending on the}} species and water temperature. They feed on copepods, arthropod larvae and other zooplankton, eventually settling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor</b> and developing directly into adults with no distinct metamorphoses that are present in other groups of mollusc larvae. Octopus species that produce larger eggs – including the southern blue-ringed, Caribbean reef, California two-spot, Eledone moschata and deep sea octopuses – {{do not have a}} paralarval stage, but hatch as benthic animals similar to the adults.|$|E
5|$|During {{her career}} Danton {{was sent to}} Great Britain to honor the {{coronation}} of George V, and later served in World War I as an escort for supply ships and troop transports, guarding them from elements of the German Navy. While en route to aid a blockade, she was torpedoed and sunk on 19 March 1917 by a German U-boat, leaving 296 men dead. The location of the wreck remained a mystery until an underwater survey team inadvertently discovered the battleship in December 2007. In February 2009, the wreck was confirmed to be Danton. The ship is in remarkably good shape for her age. Danton rests upright <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor,</b> {{and most of the}} original equipment is reported to be intact.|$|E
5|$|Thallium {{can also}} be {{obtained}} from the smelting of lead and zinc ores. Manganese nodules found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor</b> contain some thallium, but the collection of these nodules has been prohibitively expensive. There is also the potential for damaging the oceanic environment. In addition, several other thallium minerals, containing 16% to 60% thallium, occur in nature as complexes of sulfides or selenides that primarily contain antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, and/or silver. These minerals are rare, and they have had no commercial importance as sources of thallium. The Allchar deposit in southern Macedonia was the only area where thallium was actively mined. This deposit still contains an estimated 500tonnes of thallium, and it is a source for several rare thallium minerals, for example lorándite.|$|E

25|$|A related {{issue is}} the methane {{clathrate}} reservoirs found under sediments <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floors.</b> These trap large amounts of the greenhouse gas methane, which <b>ocean</b> warming has <b>the</b> potential to release. In 2004 the global inventory of ocean methane clathrates was estimated to occupy between one and five million cubic kilometres. If all these clathrates were to be spread uniformly across <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor,</b> this would translate to a thickness between three and fourteen metres. This estimate corresponds to 500–2500 gigatonnes carbon (GtC), and can {{be compared with the}} 5000 GtC estimated for all other fossil fuel reserves.|$|R
50|$|Methane {{clathrate}} (CH4·5.75H2O) or (4CH4·23H2O), {{also called}} methane hydrate, hydromethane, methane ice, fire ice, natural gas hydrate, or gas hydrate, {{is a solid}} clathrate compound (more specifically, a clathrate hydrate) in which {{a large amount of}} methane is trapped within a crystal structure of water, forming a solid similar to ice. Originally thought to occur only in the outer regions of the Solar System, where temperatures are low and water ice is common, significant deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floors</b> of <b>the</b> Earth.|$|R
5|$|The 1992 Nicaragua {{earthquake}} was {{the first}} tsunami earthquake to be captured on modern broadband seismic networks. The initial surface wave magnitude was estimated at 7.2. The shock occurred on the subduction interface between the Cocos and Caribbean Plates, an active zone of stress and deformation, and due {{to the absence of}} sediment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor</b> off Nicaragua, the slip propagated up-dip {{all the way to the}} trench bottom, a creator of large tsunamis. This occurrence of slip of a plate interface filled with soft subducted sediments caused the rupturing process to be slower than the average subduction zone thrust earthquakes while the focus of the earthquake was much shallower than the typical subduction zone earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark {{is set in}} 2023 {{against the}} {{backdrop}} of an interstellar war between two races: the Maians, who resemble the archetypal grey alien, and the Skedar, reptile-like extraterrestrials who use a holographic disguise to appear as Scandinavian humans, bearing similarities to Nordic aliens. Using this disguise, they can interact with humans on Earth without looking too overtly suspicious. Meanwhile, on Earth, there is an ongoing rivalry between two factions: The Carrington Institute, a research and development center founded by Daniel Carrington that secretly operates an espionage group in league with the Maians; and dataDyne, a defence contractor corporation headed by Cassandra De Vries that secretly maintains a deal with the Skedar: in exchange for creating an AI capable of cracking an ancient alien spacecraft buried <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor,</b> the Skedar have agreed to supply them with enough alien technology to become the biggest corporation on Earth.|$|E

5|$|The energy {{provided}} by tidal flexing drives active geological processes within Europa's interior, {{just as they}} do to a far more obvious degree on its sister moon Io. Although Europa, like the Earth, may possess an internal energy source from radioactive decay, the energy generated by tidal flexing would be several orders of magnitude greater than any radiological source. Life on Europa could exist clustered around hydrothermal vents <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor,</b> or below the ocean floor, where endoliths are known to inhabit on Earth. Alternatively, it could exist clinging to the lower surface of Europa's ice layer, much like algae and bacteria in Earth's polar regions, or float freely in Europa's ocean. If Europa's ocean is too cold, biological processes similar to those known on Earth could not take place. If it is too salty, only extreme halophiles could survive in that environment. In 2010, a model proposed by Richard Greenberg of the University of Arizona proposed that irradiation of ice on Europa's surface could saturate its crust with oxygen and peroxide, which could then be transported via tectonic processes into the interior ocean. Such a process could render Europa's ocean as oxygenated as our own within just 12 million years, allowing for the existence of complex, multicellular lifeforms.|$|E

25|$|The {{total amount}} of helium-3 in the mantle {{may be in the}} range of 0.1–1 million tonnes. However, most of the mantle is not {{directly}} accessible. Some helium-3 leaks up through deep-sourced hotspot volcanoes such as those of the Hawaiian Islands, but only 300grams per year is emitted to the atmosphere. Mid-ocean ridges emit another 3 kilogram per year. Around subduction zones, various sources produce helium-3 in natural gas deposits which possibly contain a thousand tonnes of helium-3 (although there may be 25 thousand tonnes if all ancient subduction zones have such deposits). Wittenberg estimated that United States crustal natural gas sources may have only half a tonne total. Wittenberg cited Anderson's estimate of another 1200 metric tonnes in interplanetary dust particles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floors.</b> In <b>the</b> 1994 study, extracting helium-3 from these sources consumes more energy than fusion would release.|$|R
