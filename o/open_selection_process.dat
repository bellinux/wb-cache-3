50|$|By April 2016, Clinton {{had begun}} discussions with {{advisers}} and allies regarding her potential running mate, though Bernie Sanders continued to challenge {{her in the}} Democratic primaries. According to campaign sources, Clinton {{did not have a}} particular running mate in mind, and did not feel pressured to pick a running mate designed specifically to appeal to Sanders supporters. There was relatively little public discussion about Sanders's running mate selection process. As the 2016 Republican National Convention took place roughly one week before the July 25-28 Democratic National Convention, the Democratic presidential nominee was set to choose her running mate after the Republicans nominated their ticket of Donald Trump and Mike Pence. Clinton's running mate selection process was led by campaign chairman John Podesta and Cheryl Mills, while the vetting process was led by attorney James Hamilton. In discussing her potential vice presidential choice, Clinton stated that the most important attribute she was looking for is the ability and experience to immediately step into the role of president. In contrast to previous Democratic presidential nominees, Clinton allowed for a relatively <b>open</b> <b>selection</b> <b>process,</b> holding rallies with many potential running mates and placing little emphasis on keeping her short list confidential.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to highlight an engagement and participation process for health consumers used effectively by a State Government agency. Consumer representation in government has been undertaken in a variety of ways although there is often no easily available and well documented model for selecting and engaging consumers. It is recognised that consumer participation has become an active part of planning health services and more demands are being put on their contribution. i Early in its life the Program identified the need for active consumer engagement because the agenda was changing and issues were complex. Selection for consumer representation on a Stakeholder Advisory Group would take place through a fair and <b>open</b> <b>selection</b> <b>process</b> based on six previously decided and widely advertised appointment principles. A selection panel comprising representatives from the lead organisation and both a national and state based consumer organisation participated in the selection process.

40|$|The {{evolution}} in the design process is usually based on {{the choice of a}} method for designing the system, in which its preference is previously selected by a process available to use and not by an <b>open</b> <b>selection</b> <b>process.</b> An open system approach is both a technical approach to design concepts and a preferred business strategy that is becoming widely applied by manufacturers of large complex systems. Although systems engineering consider both the business and the technical needs of customers, their goals is to provide a quality product that meets all user needs. This paper describes the capabilities of using some available systems engineering standards (like EIA- 632) in the design process. Then, a methodological approach will be proposed for the practice of requirements engineering by applying quality assessment and control to design in early phases. This paper also discusses the need for a rigorous systems engineering process, which incorporates open systems concepts and principles to make a design method more or less appropriate by promoting multiple sources of supply and technology insertion. To demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of those standards, an application case study focusing more on applying systems engineering concepts to the building design is described along with verification and validation processes...|$|E

40|$|In May 2007 CGD {{launched}} an online {{survey of the}} global development community on three issues: the <b>selection</b> <b>process</b> for the next World Bank president; criteria for rating the candidates; and actual ratings for nine candidates who had been named by the international media. Between May 22 and May 31, CGD received nearly 700 responses from people whose characteristics reflect {{the diversity of the}} international development community. Survey participants represent 71 nations; all world regions; high-, middle- and low-income countries; a variety of professional affiliations; and all adult age groups. About 30 % of respondents are women. Although the participants are diverse, their responses indicate striking unity on all three survey issues. First, both U. S. and non-U. S. participants reject the traditional selection prerogative of the U. S. by large margins, with equally strong support for an <b>open,</b> transparent, competitive <b>selection</b> <b>process.</b> Second, participants exhibit uniformity in the relative importance they ascribe to CGD’s five proposed criteria for selecting candidates. Most respondents assign the highest priorities to management effectiveness and international organization experience, followed in order by knowledge of development, banking/finance experience and political/diplomatic experience. Third, the participants exhibit uniformity in rating the nine candidates. Our survey suggests that despite their diversity, survey participants from the U.

40|$|When lawyers elect {{the leaders}} of their self-regulatory organizations, what sort of people do they vote for? How do the <b>selection</b> <b>processes</b> for elite lawyer sub-groups affect the {{diversity}} and efficacy of those groups? This article quantitatively assesses the demographic and professional diversity of leadership in the Law Society of Upper Canada. After many years of underrepresentation, in 2015 visible minority members and women were elected in numbers proportionate to their shares of Ontario lawyers. Regression analysis suggests that being non-white was not a disadvantage in the 2015 election, and being female actually conferred an advantage in attracting lawyers’ votes. The diverse employment contexts of the province’s lawyers were also represented in the elected group. However, early-career lawyers were completely unrepresented. This is largely a consequence of electoral system design choices, and can be remedied through the implementation of career-stage constituencies.

40|$|In this study, I {{design an}} {{empirical}} <b>open</b> source software <b>selection</b> <b>process,</b> which reuses some ideas from Commercial Off-the-Shelf selection methods and addresses {{the characteristics of}} the open source software. Basically, it consists of three basic steps: identification, screening and evaluation. The identification step is to find all possible alternatives to open source software that can meet the high level requirements. The next step is screening, in which the refined requirements are applied to filter the alternatives. The evaluation step is based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process, in which the alternatives are inspected from functional suitability, source code, support strength and popularity. In more detail, under functionality suitability criterion, alternatives to open source software are evaluated in viewing of how much functionality can fit in with the functional user requirements. The source code of the alternatives is evaluated from six criteria: programming language, code size, code comment, code intra-module complexity and code inter-module complexity. The evaluation of support strength depends on the evaluation of field support and support resources. The field support includes commercial support and community support. The community support specifically refers to the direct responses from the community to the support requests. Aside from field support, open source software projects also provide various support-related resources such as, documents, wiki, blog, etc. To determine the popularity of the alternatives, I evaluate them from software use, development participation and web popularity. In the case study, I utilize the process to select the best open source unified modeling language tool from the ten alternatives for the software development process. After the screening phase, the four competitive alternatives, BOUML, ArgoUML, UMLet and Violet, are evaluated from functionality, source code, support strength and popularity criteria. The evaluation result indicates that ArgoUML is the best tool for the requirement. The case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the <b>selection</b> <b>process.</b> Various important attributes of open source software are taken into consideration systematically and the final decision is reached based on comprehensive investigation and analysis. The process provides an operable solution to the <b>open</b> source <b>selection</b> problem in practice...|$|R

The <b>selection</b> <b>process</b> includes advertising the post, shortlisting, interviews, ratification, as well as recommendation and appointment by the HoD. This study confines itself to how the <b>selection</b> <b>processes</b> and procedure for the appointment of educators are followed by the school governing body. The research is also concerned with the ability of the governing body to manage the impact of the <b>selection</b> <b>process.</b> It is essential for them to have the necessary skills and knowledge to manage the <b>selection</b> <b>process.</b> The legislative principles in terms of the <b>selection</b> <b>process</b> were also investigated. The study focuses on the <b>selection</b> <b>process</b> for the appointment of educators in four township schools, namely two primary and two secondary schools. The researcher used a qualitative approach to gather the information for the research. Semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions were conducted. Interviews were conducted with four principals and four chairpersons of school governing bodies. Findings of this research emanating both from a literature review and interviews reveal the importance of following the proper <b>selection</b> <b>processes,</b> procedures and the legal principles when appointing educators. The study also reveals the inadequate training of some school governing bodies to carry out the process. The type of training provided by the Department of Education has a negative impact on the outcomes of the <b>selection</b> <b>process.</b> This study also reveals that the legal requirements of the <b>selection</b> <b>process</b> are not considered during the <b>selection</b> <b>process.</b> The recommendations made are based on the findings of this research. The focus is on the importance of intensive training of school governing bodies to enable them to handle the <b>selection</b> <b>process</b> properly. These bodies have to deal properly with external influences that tend to have an undue influence on the outcome of the <b>selection</b> <b>process.</b> Objectivity has to prevail throughout the process.

40|$|Rural generalist {{medicine}} was recognised in Queensland {{as a medical}} discipline of specialist equivalence in 2008. Since {{the introduction of the}} career pathway in 2007, approximately 140 trainees have commenced training on this education continuum to rural generalist status. The Rural Generalist Pathway—which includes a challenging prevocational start to the career, the opportunity to specialise in a procedural skill or skills of interest and obtain general practice vocational training in a rural setting—is certainly proving an attractive choice for those searching for a challenging and varied career. Although currently a Queensland phenomenon, this unique and exciting career pathway continues to generate increased interest and enthusiasm across all Australian states and territories now wishing to join this new wave of generalist practice. This new generation of health professionals {{for a new generation of}} services will, in turn, provide the rural medical workforce the bush needs. As the number of trainees increases, so in turn does the competition for advanced skills training posts. The pursuit to identify, accredit and develop not only a range, but an appropriate number of advanced skills training posts is now a major focus and challenge to the ongoing expansion of the training pathway. A collaborative approach to identifying posts, selecting appropriate applicants via an <b>open</b> merit <b>selection</b> <b>process</b> and providing ongoing orientation and support throughout the advanced skills training year is currently a major state wide project of the pathway. A significant outcome of the pathway currently being researched concerns the advanced skill(s) being pursued including identifying how many trainees go on to use the skills, in what location(s), and for how long. This paper will identify and report on the outcomes of the research into the advanced skills being pursued and used by rural generalists in Queensland and the new collaborative state wide approach to securing, selecting and supporting advanced skills trainees. It will also outline applicability of the concept of the rural generalist in other jurisdictions, and perhaps in other disciplines...|$|R
