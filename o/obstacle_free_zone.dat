40|$|The {{rapid changes}} in map-based {{technologies}} caused a complexity in spatial data and increased user demands and expectations from Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Considering this reality, Spatial Data Integration (SDI) {{needed to be}} taken into account by National Mapping Agencies and companies for developing strategies to have better data (complete, standard, robust and flexible) for a wide public use of GIS applications. On the other side, visualization became an essential process in data integration facilities as it was used in every stage in GIS, besides providing useful cartographic representing capabilities in 3 -D environment. This paper presents an overview of spatial data integration from different aspects and explores the role of visualization in this context. In the content of this paper it is also examined how to use analytical and visual types of derived information in solving spatial problems by presenting an implementation study related to the construction of <b>obstacle</b> <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> for aerodromes. <b>Obstacle</b> Limitation Surfaces (OLS), the topography and man-made objects were used as cartographic input layers in determining dangerous objects for aircraft and final analyses results were presented with 3 -D screen displays. Consequently, it was perceived that visualization removed the limitations of GIS and modern cartographic developments provided visual cognition of multi-dimensional spatial problems. 1...|$|R

30|$|Understanding {{what the}} term free port covers {{is the first}} step to {{approach}} the structure of free ports. The Atlas of the <b>Free</b> <b>Zones</b> in the World (Bost, 2010), compiled more than forty-five different names that have been used related to the concept of <b>free</b> <b>zones.</b> According to the author, these terms are often used interchangeably, and sometimes they are simply marketing terms from the promoters of a zone. Therefore, there is confusion about both definitions and concepts. From this taxonomy, it is considered that <b>free</b> <b>zone</b> is a concept that can be divided into two categories: export processing zones that are manufacturing-oriented <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> and <b>free</b> trade <b>zones</b> that are trade-oriented <b>free</b> <b>zones.</b> The World Bank (2008; Farole, 2011) has the same dual approach by using the term special economic zone while referring to a <b>free</b> <b>zone.</b> This term makes sense if the status of such zones is considered although it creates confusion because there is a specific Chinese model of <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> named Special Economic Zones and this model covers only a part of the concept. Free port, however, is the long-standing terminology of such zones and refers to the logistic function of the concept (Lavissière et al., 2014). It is argued that the term free port is a transversal concept of <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> and a <b>free</b> port can either be an export processing <b>zone</b> or a <b>free</b> trade <b>zone.</b> It is therefore the term that has been retained.|$|R
40|$|Practice in {{developed}} and developing countries indicates the existence of numerous and heterogeneous <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> {{as well as the}} different role which they have in the economic development of countries that have implemented them. The main objective for start-up of a modern <b>free</b> <b>zone</b> with industrial characteristics is to attract those investors who will build the industrial infrastructure for the production of goods aimed for exports. Consequently, <b>free</b> <b>zone</b> will contribute, inter alia, to the increase in national exports and decrease in deficit of the country’s current account, to the creation of new jobs and new added value, to the increase in the dynamics of economic activities and generation of new entrepreneurial opportunities, to the transfer of new technologies, knowledge, skills, good organizational and managerial business practice, {{as well as to the}} reduction of regional imbalance. Experiences of former transition countries indicate that a <b>free</b> <b>zone</b> represents an important policy instrument for the attraction of foreign direct investment, especially the greenfield ones. Furthermore, experiences of developed countries indicate that <b>free</b> <b>zone</b> can act as a policy instrument for promoting regional development and development of a country as a whole. The main purpose of this paper is to consider the benefits that <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> can have on economic and social development of the area where they are located.

30|$|Today, few free ports {{remain at}} the level of a city state, but there are notable {{exceptions}} such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Malta and Dubai. Still, they belong to larger economic entities having a common customs regulatory regime. Nowadays, there are free ports connecting to a network of <b>free</b> <b>zones.</b> These <b>free</b> ports are incorporating different types of <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> such as industry and services into a ‘free zone area’. Mauritius, for instance, linked the <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> of its port and airport to industrial zones producing textile and then developed an IT dedicated <b>free</b> <b>zone</b> (Lavissière, 2014). All these zones are linked commercially but also physically within customs corridors (where flows are permitted on the domestic system as long as they go from one element of the <b>free</b> <b>zone</b> to another). Tanger-Med has a similar development strategy with its port, a planned airport, an automotive <b>free</b> <b>zone,</b> a logistics <b>free</b> port, an industrial <b>free</b> <b>zone</b> and an offshore banking <b>free</b> <b>zone.</b> This model illustrates a regionalization of free ports by permitting a specialization of the free port functions within the free port itself as well as through satellite facilities. Thus, the regulatory framework of free ports corresponds to infrastructural developments of transport terminals in regard to their hinterland. Tanger-Med and Barcelona <b>Free</b> <b>Zone</b> also signed an agreement on promotion, exchange of best practices and trade facilitation that creates a customs free corridor between the two entities. In the United States, <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> are technically networked since it is possible to move goods from one zone to another without disbursing custom duties. Still, this status is in its infancy at the transnational level and {{it remains to be seen}} the scale and extent free ports will create effective trade networks.|$|R
