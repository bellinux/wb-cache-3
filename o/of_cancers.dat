5|$|Another way enzyme {{malfunctions}} {{can cause}} disease comes from germline mutations in genes coding for DNA repair enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are {{less able to}} repair mutations in their genomes. This causes a slow accumulation of mutations and results in the development <b>of</b> <b>cancers.</b> An {{example of such a}} hereditary cancer syndrome is xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes the development of skin cancers in response to even minimal exposure to ultraviolet light.|$|E

40|$|Cancer is {{characterized}} by the malignant cellular growth that tends to spread. It is the second leading cause of death after heart disease. Cancer incidence varies with regions and populations around the world. The incidence of various types <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> ranges from rare of gallbladder to 12 % <b>of</b> most common <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> lung. In men, the minimum incidence <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> is that <b>of</b> gallbladder (4. 4 %) an the maximum is the incidence <b>of</b> lung <b>cancer</b> (18. 6 %). In women, the minimum incidence <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> is that <b>of</b> endometrium (3. 44 %) and the maximum is that <b>of</b> breast <b>cancer</b> (18. 18 %). Dietary prevention <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> is also a long term process and it may take 10 to 60 years to have an impact, the time scale depending, to some extent on the type <b>of</b> <b>cancer.</b> The epidemiological data suggest that the major causative factor for the incidence <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> is environment. The environmental factors causing cancer include diet, radiation, chemicals and tobacco. The diet {{plays a major role in}} the development and prevention <b>of</b> <b>cancer.</b> Consumption <b>of</b> more meat, fatty foods of animal origin and salted foods increase the incidence <b>of</b> <b>cancer.</b> Method <b>of</b> preparation like grilling and barbecuing of meat also increase the incidence <b>of</b> <b>cancer.</b> Intake <b>of</b> foods of plant origin reduce the chance <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> incidence...|$|R

5|$|Natural thorium decays {{very slowly}} {{compared}} {{to many other}} radioactive materials, and the emitted alpha radiation cannot penetrate human skin. As a result, handling small amounts of thorium, {{such as those in}} gas mantles, is considered safe, although the use of such items may pose some risks. Exposure to an aerosol of thorium, such as contaminated dust, can lead to increased risk <b>of</b> <b>cancers</b> of the lung, pancreas, and blood, as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation. Exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of liver diseases.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Kerala {{became the}} first state in India to offer free cancer {{treatment}} to the poor, via a program called Sukrutham. People in Kerala experience elevated incidence <b>of</b> <b>cancers,</b> liver and kidney diseases. In April 2016, the Economic Times reported that 250,000 residents undergo treatment for cancer. It also reported that approximately 150 to 200 liver transplants are conducted in the region's hospitals annually. Approximately 42,000 cancer cases are reported in the region annually.

40|$|Cancer is {{a disease}} that is widely feared because of its {{prevalence}} and incidence, its widespread causes (heredity, environment, lifestyle) {{and the belief that}} 'everything causes cancer'.

5|$|Mutations in the PRKACA {{gene that}} promote {{abnormal}} enzyme activity {{have been linked}} to disease of the adrenal gland. Several mutations in PRKACA have been found in patients with Cushing’s syndrome that result in an increase in the ability of PKA to broadly phosphorylate other proteins. One mutation in the PRKACA gene that causes an amino acid substitution of leucine to arginine in position 206, was found in over 60% of patients with adrenocortical tumors. Other mutations and genetic alterations in the PRKACA gene have been identified in adrenocortical adenomas that also disrupt PKA signaling, leading to aberrant PKA phosphorylation. The Cα gene has also been incriminated in a variety <b>of</b> <b>cancers,</b> including colon, renal, rectal, prostate, lung, breast, adrenal carcinomas and lymphomas.|$|E
