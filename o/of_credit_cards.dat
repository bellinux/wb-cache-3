In April 2007, WMATA began testing the use <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> to pay for parking at six Metro stations, avoiding the need to pay for parking with SmarTrip cards at those stations. The sites are Anacostia on the Green Line, Shady Grove on the Red Line, Vienna and New Carrollton on the Orange Line, and Franconia-Springfield and Largo Town Center on the Blue Line. One exit lane at each station accepts credit card payments through a reader next to the existing SmarTrip card target.

The characteristics <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> holders studied were (a) gender, (b) age, (c) marital status, (d) education, (e) income, and (f) occupation. Data for this study were collected in Bangkok, Thailand by telephone interviews during July- August 1993. The sample consisted of 150 Bangkok Bank <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> holders. Chi-square and Cramer 2 ̆ 7 s V were used to analyze the hypotheses. For all statistical analyses the level of significance was set at. 05. As a result of the 18 specific null hypothesis tests, only two independent variables were found to have a statistically significant relationship with the extent <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> usage. The findings suggested a positive relationship between the extent <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> usage and occupation and income. Respondents with higher occupational status and income tended to use <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> {{to a greater extent than}} those with lower occupational status and income.

40|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>cards</b> {{have become}} a common form of payment over the past fifty years, {{replacing}} both cash and the cheque that were once commonly used as payment mechanism. However, in recent years, the rising level <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt is concerning. This study addresses this public issue by investigating the antecedents <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> usage and the level <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> indebtedness. The author collected data from <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> holders (aged 18 - 65) by using mixed method approach. Focus group interviews and short survey questionnaire were employed to acquire data from participants. The results show that <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> characteristics such as its low payment transparency and utility functions are factors that influence consumers’ <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> usage. Furthermore, age <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> users also {{found to be associated}} with the usage <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card.</b> Meanwhile, regarding <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt, the results indicate that individual’s age, value, and attitudes are determinants that affect consumers’ likeliness to incur <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt. Consumers’ materialism and their spending behaviours cannot be fully linked to <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt, but the findings on this current study offer useful understanding on this issue.

25|$|In its 1978 Marquette Bank decision, {{the court}} had {{unanimously}} held that the National Banking Act of 1863, which created nationally-chartered banks {{in addition to the}} state ones that had previously existed, barred states from enforcing their anti-usury laws, which set caps on interest rates, against any national bank based in another state. In 1980, Citibank took advantage of that decision and moved its money-losing credit-card operations to South Dakota, after persuading that state's legislature and governor to repeal its anti-usury law. Other states and banks followed the example, and by 1990 the number <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> in circulation had doubled, while the average household's revolving balance increased more than fivefold.

25|$|The {{case has}} been {{called one of the}} most {{important}} of the late 20th century, since it freed nationally chartered banks to offer credit cards to anyone in the U.S. they deemed qualified, and more specifically because it allowed them to export credit card interest rates to states with stricter regulations, opening up a race between states in an effort to attract lending institutions to set up shop in their states and offer a wider variety of consumer credit products. Over the next decade, the states accelerated a process that had already begun of repealing or loosening their anti-usury laws, allowing state-chartered banks to compete more equally with national ones. As a result, the use <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> has vastly increased, and since the mortgage industry soon followed suit, the issuance of subprime mortgages also increased drastically, facilitating the housing bubble that led to the 2008 housing crisis.|$|E

25|$|Although {{credit cards}} reached very high {{adoption}} {{levels in the}} US, Canada and the UK during the latter 20th century, many cultures were more cash-oriented or developed alternative forms of cashless payments, such as Carte bleue or the Eurocard (Germany, France, Switzerland, and others). In these places, adoption <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> was initially much slower. Due to strict regulations regarding bank overdrafts, some countries, France in particular, were much quicker to develop and adopt chip-based credit cards which are seen as major anti-fraud credit devices. Debit cards and online banking (using either ATMs or PCs) are used more widely than credit cards in some countries. It took until the 1990s to reach anything like the percentage market penetration levels achieved in the US, Canada, and UK. In some countries, acceptance still remains low {{as the use of}} a credit card system depends on the banking system of each country; while in others, a country sometimes had to develop its own credit card network, e.g. UK's Barclaycard and Australia's Bankcard. Japan remains a very cash-oriented society, with credit card adoption being limited mainly to the largest of merchants; although stored value cards (such as telephone cards) are used as alternative currencies, the trend is toward RFID-based systems inside cards, cellphones, and other objects.|$|E
