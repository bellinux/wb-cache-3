40|$|Anabolic {{androgenic}} steroids (AAS) are testosterone derivatives used either clinically, in elite sports, or {{for body}} shaping {{with the goal}} to increase muscle size and strength. Clinically developed compounds and nonclinically tested designer steroids often marketed as food supplements are widely used. Despite the considerable evidence for various adverse effects of AAS use, the underlying molecular mechanisms are insufficiently understood. Here, we investigated whether some AAS, {{as a result of}} a lack of target selectivity, might inhibit 11 b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11 b-HSD 2) –dependent inactivation of glucocorticoids. Using recombinant human 11 b-HSD 2, we observed inhibitory effects for several AAS. Whereas oxymetholone, <b>oxymesterone,</b> danazol, and testosterone showed medium inhibitory potential, fluoxymesterone was a potent inhibitor of human 11 b-HSD 2 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC 50] of 60 – 100 nM in cell lysates; IC 5...|$|E

Measurements with rat kidney microsomes and lysates of cells expressing recombinant mouse 11 β-HSD 2 revealed much weaker inhibition by the AAS tested, indicating that the adverse effects of AAS-dependent 11 β-HSD 2 inhibition cannot be investigated in rats and mice. Furthermore, we provide evidence that fluoxymesterone is metabolized to 11 -oxofluoxymesterone by human 11 β-HSD 2. Structural modeling revealed similar binding modes for fluoxymesterone and cortisol, supporting a competitive mode of inhibition of 11 β-HSD 2 -dependent cortisol oxidation by this AAS. No direct modulation of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) function was observed. Thus, 11 β-HSD 2 inhibition by fluoxymesterone may cause cortisol-induced MR activation, thereby leading to electrolyte disturbances and contributing to the development of hypertension and cardiovascular diseas...|$|E
