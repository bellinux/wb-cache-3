5|$|The video {{begins with}} a shot of Minogue posing in a dark room, dressed in a {{sparkling}} costume on which rainbow-lighting is projected. She is then shown {{in front of a}} wall wearing a flowing maroon dress. As the intro ends and the first verse commences, Minogue appears in a hall and performs various dance routine with numerous female dancers clad in nude bodysuits. The singer's attire consists of a pleated red <b>organza</b> dress designed by Austrian fashion designer Helmut Lang (in 2006, Minogue donated this costume to the Arts Centre Melbourne museum, where it is displayed in the Kylie Minogue Collection). Shots of the dancers in kaleidoscopic arrangements are intercut. A few seconds later, Minogue and a man dance together alone in a hall. Their dance ends with the man slowly laying Minogue {{down on the floor and}} leaving. Twelve women in golden and pastel pink dresses are seen dancing on a dark brown floor, which is revealed to be Minogue's hat as the camera pans out. She proceeds to wave to a distant person and then plucks the petals out of a pink rose she is holding. The rest of the video randomly intersperses all of the previous scenes.|$|E
25|$|To {{create the}} ruby slippers, the shoes were dyed red, then {{burgundy}} sequined <b>organza</b> overlays {{were attached to}} each shoe's upper and heel. The film's early three-strip Technicolor process required the sequins to be darker than most red sequins found today; bright red sequins would have appeared orange on screen. Two weeks {{before the start of}} shooting, Adrian added butterfly-shaped red strap leather bows. Each of the Art Deco-inspired bows had three large, rectangular, red-glass jewels with dark red bugle beads, outlined in red glass rhinestones in silver settings. The stones and beads were sewn to the bows, then to the organza-covered shoe. Three pairs of the surviving slippers had orange felt glued to their soles to deaden the sound of Garland dancing on the Yellow Brick Road.|$|E

40|$|I was {{commissioned}} {{to do the}} fabrics for the Louis Vuitton S/S 2007 Collection. I trialled my initial ideas as design prototypes in collaboration with an embroidery company, developing three-dimensional rosebud <b>organzas</b> (a sheer fabric) which I printed both back and front, a technique {{which has not been}} used before. These trials were made without commercial constraints but my prototypes will nevertheless have future implications for the industry in terms of pushing the boundaries of the design discipline. I applied and developed them in the Louis Vuitton “Marie Antoinette” collection (S/S 2007), which used fine, low level embroidery on chiffon which I then printed colour over, blocking and defacing the beauty and fine work of traditional high fashion luxury textiles...|$|R

2500|$|At {{some point}} in 1964, Jacqueline Kennedy had seen Gloria Schiff, the twin sister of the Rome-based fashion editor of American Vogue and Valentino's friend Consuelo Crespi, wearing a two-piece {{ensemble}} in black <b>organza</b> at a gathering. It made such an impression that Kennedy contacted Ms. Schiff to learn {{the name of the}} ensemble's designer, which was Valentino. In September 1964, Valentino was to be in the United States to present a collection of his work at a charity ball at New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Mrs. Kennedy wanted to view the collection but could not attend the event, so Valentino decided to send a model, sales representative and a selection of key pieces from his collection to Mrs. Kennedy's apartment on Fifth Avenue. Mrs. Kennedy ordered six of his haute couture dresses, all in black and white, and wore them during her year of mourning following President John F. Kennedy's assassination. From then on, she was a devoted client and would become a friend. Valentino would later design the white [...] worn by Kennedy at her wedding to Greek tycoon Aristotle Onassis.

2500|$|She also enlisted costume {{designer}} Arianne Phillips {{to create the}} dresses for the film. The costumes designed were a combination of real vintage pieces, others were remade based on patterns that were obtained out of the museum archives, and the rest had to be freshly made. In an interview with W magazine in November 2011, Philips explained that she [...] "started doing research in 2009, a year before [...] began filming... To me, Wallis Simpson was a style icon, but I didn’t know she was a couture client well before she met Edward. She was also a hungry whore for jewelry. Edward gave Wallis jewelry {{to make her feel}} royal. My first task was figuring out how to re-create those famous gifts." [...] Madonna had sent a box of her research to Phillips, so that the designer could get a head start for the project. The singer understood the kind of attention to detail needed to create the costumes, drawing from her own garments which included couture. Phillips then researched the clothes on display at fashion departments of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in New York, the Musée de la Mode et du Textile in Paris and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. She then went to Los Angeles, where retailer Doris Raymond, from The Way We Wore had opened up her personal library of 1930s couture. There Phillips watched old newsreels from the University of California archives. Once filming started, the designer moved in Madonna's guesthouse in London, where they would watch the shot reels together and scrutinise the dresses. Phillips established contacts with designer labels like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels to replicate a cross bracelet and ten other pieces. For the gowns, undergarments, and dresses needed for the 60costume changes in the film, Phillips scoured the archives of Vionnet and Schiaparelli; then with the cooperation of both houses she redesigned Simpson's clothing. The first dress in which Riseborough appeared as Simpson in the film was a re-creation of the dress owned by Simpson herself. Phillips decked the dresses with diamond bow brooch at the neck and paired with <b>organza</b> skirts, and was able to obtain duplicates for some of them from Cos Prop, a costume shop in London.|$|E
