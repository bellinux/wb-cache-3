50|$|Omnichannel {{retailing}} is {{an expansion}} of multi-channel retailing. The major change {{between the two is}} the level of integration. Multi-channel is usually identified as a non-integrated way to approach customers while <b>omni-channel</b> requires coherent and absolute integration. More and more retailers have realized the opportunities and advantages of integrating multi-channels by adopting the <b>omni-channel</b> approach. The boundaries between diverse channels tend to vanish in an <b>omni-channel</b> environment, giving the customer a completely unified experience. An omnichannel retailer has traditional methods of mass advertising integrated with emerging interactive channels. Websites, email offers, social media messaging and physical stores all show the same messages, offers, and products. The <b>omni-channel</b> concept not only extends the range of channels, but also incorporates the needs, communications and interactions between customer, brand and retailer.|$|E

30|$|Warehousing is one {{function}} in the logistics process that most products flow through. As competition for many markets is spelled as “faster,” “cheaper,” “broader assortment,” “more customized,” “home delivery,” etc. and markets {{at the same time}} are becoming more global, those requirements will also impact a logistics function like warehousing. Furthermore, different requirements from different sales channels (e-commerce, retail, indirect channels, <b>omni-channels),</b> from different production philosophies (e.g., lean or agile), different managerial perspectives (e.g., economic efficiency, green performance and social responsibility), and the choice between old and new technologies [e.g., radio frequency identification device (RFID) and bar coding, different degrees of automation, decentralized control, cyber-physical systems, voice picking, warehouse management systems (WMS), etc.] impose challenges and opportunities for the warehousing operations.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Omni-Channels</b> {{ensure that}} {{customers}} {{have the same}} shopping experience online {{as they do in}} a physical store. Customers should be able to view products online and pay for them accordingly. Customers should also be assured that when they are paying for their items online, all their information is safe and secure.

30|$|As {{a result}} of the rapid growth of Chinese economy over the past four decades, the number of Chinese {{companies}} in the global Fortune 500 has reached 115 in 2017, including 109 based in Chinese mainland and Chinese Hong Kong (Fortune, 2017). Not only in size but also in quality and innovation have Chinese companies managed to grow. China is leading the world or among the frontrunners in e-commerce, mobile payment, sharing economy, artificial intelligence, 3 D printing, and pilotless planes. The top four e-commerce giants BATJ (an acronym to refer to Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and JD.com, and especially Alibaba and Tencent) are powering new business models in the name of New Retail, which refers to the combination of <b>omni-channels</b> (online and offline), socialization in addition to merely retail transactions, and the use of big data to personalize consumer experiences. However, no well-known management tool, method, concept, or theory has emerged from best practices of Chinese firms, let alone anything generalizable and adopted beyond a single company. In contrast, during the late 1980 s and later, when the success of Japanese firms produced new manufacturing methodologies such as lean manufacturing, the Kanban system, just-in-time inventory management, popularized by the Toyota Production System.|$|R
