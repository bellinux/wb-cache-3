5|$|At {{the age of}} {{twenty-three years}} male peasants were drafted {{to serve in the}} military, where they were {{assigned}} to infantry, cavalry, or navy service. After one year of training, they went on to perform a year of actual military service in frontier garrisons or as guards in the capital city. They remained liable to perform this year of service until the age of fifty-six. This was also the age when they were dismissed from their local militias, which they could join once they had finished their year of conscripted service. These non-professional conscripted soldiers comprised the Southern Army (Nanjun 南軍), while the Northern Army (Beijun 北軍) was a standing army composed <b>of</b> <b>paid</b> career soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Mental health {{consists}} of a broad scope of measurements of mental well being including depression, stress and measurements of self-worth. Numerous factors affect the prevalence of mental health disorders among women in India, including older age, low educational attainment, fewer children in the home, lack <b>of</b> <b>paid</b> employment and excessive spousal alcohol use. There is also {{evidence to suggest that}} disadvantages associated with gender increase the risk for mental health disorders. Women who find it acceptable for men to use violence against female partners may view themselves as less valuable than men. In turn, this may lead women to seek out fewer avenues of healthcare inhibiting their ability to cope with various mental disorders.|$|E

Users complained that the game was too shortsome saying that it is only four hours long, about the existence <b>of</b> <b>paid,</b> downloadable content for some versions at launch, and that the Windows and OS X versions were ports of the console version. Other journalists countered that the quality of the graphics on the Windows and Mac versions did not suggest a simple console port. Stephen Totilo of Kotaku wrote that the game lasted nine hours and that the downloadable content consisted purely of cosmetic add-ons. Some journalists said that the minimal impact of The Potato Sack alternative reality game on the early release of Portal 2 may be influencing the user scores.|$|E

5|$|Under communism, {{everyone}} was guaranteed employment. However, women suffered the double burden <b>of</b> <b>paid</b> and unpaid work, leading to lower birth rates. The commitment to social equality {{and the issue}} of declining birth rates allowed women to have some rights, such as child care and child allowances. For example, in the Soviet Union, maternity leave was extended to three years and part-time work was introduced. With the collapse of communism, many of these rights have been revoked due to the new largely male oriented democracy that has been put in place. Although there has been an increase in female workers, their need for welfare support such as child care has not been met, and has been ignored.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} that Richard II was deposed in 1399, {{the power of the}} major noble magnates had grown considerably; {{powerful}} rulers such as Henry IV would contain them, but during the minority of Henry VI they controlled the country. The magnates depended upon their income from rent and trade to allow them to maintain groups <b>of</b> <b>paid,</b> armed retainers, often sporting controversial livery, and buy support amongst the wider gentry; this system has been dubbed bastard feudalism. Their influence was exerted both through the House of Lords at Parliament and through the king's council. The gentry and wealthier townsmen exercised increasing influence through the House of Commons, opposing raising taxes to pay for the French wars. By the 1430s and 1440s the English government was in major financial difficulties, leading to the crisis of 1450 and a popular revolt under the leadership of Jack Cade. Law and order deteriorated, and the crown was unable to intervene in the factional fighting between different nobles and their followers. The resulting Wars of the Roses saw a savage escalation of violence between the noble leaderships of both sides: captured enemies were executed and family lands attainted. By {{the time that}} Henry VII took the throne in 1485, England's governmental and social structures had been substantially weakened, with whole noble lines extinguished.|$|E

5|$|Journalists {{noted that}} many of the user reviews for Portal 2 on Metacritic evoked {{negative}} opinion of the game, believed to be tied to the minimal impact on Portal 2s release time. These users cited complaints about the game being too short (with some saying it is only four hours long), the existence <b>of</b> <b>paid</b> downloadable content at launch for some versions, and supposed evidence that the game on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X were ports of the console version. Journalists have defended Valve in these claims, countering that the game's length depends on the amount of immersion the player puts into the game, that the downloadable content is only cosmetic additions for the co-op mode, and that the quality of the graphics on the Windows and Mac version do not suggest a simple console port.|$|E
