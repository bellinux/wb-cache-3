40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: In Australia, {{there have been}} recent reports of unusual abortions in mid- to late-gestation mares. These were clinically distinct from other recognised causes of pregnancy loss and the term 2 ̆ 7 equine amnionitis and fetal loss 2 ̆ 7 (EAFL) was adopted to describe this syndrome. Initial investigations concluded that possible causal factors included the presence on affected stud farms of <b>Processionary</b> <b>caterpillars</b> (Ochrogaster lunifer). Objectives: To determine if exposure of pregnant mares to <b>Processionary</b> <b>caterpillars</b> or their shed exoskeletons can induce EAFL. Methods: <b>Processionary</b> <b>caterpillars</b> and their shed exoskeletons were collected and stored frozen. Mid-gestation mares were dosed with a slurry of caterpillars or shed exoskeleton by nasogastric intubation. Their clinical responses and times to abortion were recorded. All aborted fetuses were autopsied and samples taken for bacteriological and virological culture and histopathology. Results: Intubating mares in mid-pregnancy with preparations of either whole <b>Processionary</b> <b>caterpillars</b> or shed caterpillar exoskeletons induced abortion with few impending clinical signs. The gross pathological and bacteriological findings of the aborted fetuses {{were similar to those}} observed in field cases of EAFL. Potential relevance: Possible exposure to <b>Processionary</b> <b>caterpillars</b> should be considered when examining cases of fetal loss in the mare. The present results provide a starting point to further explore the aetiology and pathogenesis of EAFL...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} abortions {{occurred}} in mares in New South Wales during 2004 that involved unusual bacteria and unique lesions on post mortem examination of aborted foetuses and foetal membranes. Investigations ensued {{to determine the}} cause of the abortions and the condition was termed Equine Amnionitis and Foetal Loss (EAFL). Studies within this body of work detail the histopathology and outline the bacteria associated with the clinical cases of EAFL. A detailed working case definition for EAFL is also given. An epidemiological association was found between the abortions and the presence of the <b>Processionary</b> <b>caterpillar</b> (Ochrogaster lunifer) leading to experimental studies involving the exposure of mid-term pregnant mares to the exoskeleton or whole <b>Processionary</b> <b>caterpillar.</b> The experiments involved nasogastric exposure with suspended emulsified caterpillar exoskeleton (1 g, 3 g, and 5 g) or emulsified suspended whole caterpillar (50 g, 100 g) for 5 days.

50|$|In {{the absence}} of a radiant heat source, the body {{temperature}} of aggregated social caterpillars may be several degrees Celsius above ambient temperature. This phenomenon was first reported in 1938 in Vanessa caterpillars. Subsequently, other studies showed that the shelter of the pine <b>processionary</b> <b>caterpillar</b> Thaumetopoea pityocampa rose 2 to 3 °C when occupied by the caterpillars and cooled down when they left the structure to feed. Studies of the social caterpillars of Eriogaster lanestris showed that the internal temperature of the nest exceed ambient temperature by as much as 6.7 °C, though the average temperature gains of 2 to 3 °C were in line with those reported for other species. These thermal gains reported for these species appear attributable to the trapping of the metabolic heat generated by the caterpillars as they process food.|$|R
50|$|An ant mill is an {{observed}} {{phenomenon in}} which a group of army ants, which are blind, are separated from the main foraging party, lose the pheromone track and begin to follow one another, forming a continuously rotating circle.

The phenomenon is {{a side effect of}} the self-organizing structure of ant colonies. Each ant follows the ant in front of it, which works until something goes wrong, and an ant mill forms. An ant mill was first described by William Beebe in 1921 who observed a mill 1200 ft (~370 m) in circumference. It took each ant 2.5 hours to make one revolution.

40|$|We {{investigated}} how {{modifications in}} winter and spring temperature conditions may affect the survival of a spring-hatching Lepidoptera, the <b>oak</b> <b>processionary</b> moth Thaumetopoea processionea. Supercooling and chilling injury experiments indicate that eggs are especially cold hardy {{at the start of}} the winter period, although this ability is reduced later in the season. In the spring, young larvae are sufficiently cold hardy to ensure no direct mortality as a result of late frosts. A comparison of phenological models shows that neonate larvae may await the unfolding of new oak leaves for relatively long periods (e. g. 1 - 30 days). Under both low (4 °C after 5 days at 16 °C) and high temperature experimental scenarios (constant 16 °C), the majority of neonate larvae can survive starvation for more than 2 weeks. Larvae may also suffer from food depletion once their development has been initiated (e. g. during cold springs) if the threshold temperature for feeding is not reached for several consecutive days, or in the case of late frosts affecting foliage availability. When temperature is reduced to 4 °C, developing larvae become inactive and do not feed anymore; their starvation survival capability is reduced to approximately 2 weeks (cold spring hypothesis). At 16 °C, developing larvae that are deprived of food can only survive for 10 days (late frost hypothesis). We conclude that, in the <b>oak</b> <b>processionary</b> moth, neonate larvae are relatively well adapted to early hatching relative to budburst, ensuring them the highest foliage quality for development. In some years, however, phenological asynchrony or cold spring conditions may affect the persistence of populations at the limits of the species' range. © 2012 The Authors.

In recent years, adverse reactions reports in humans following contact with T. pityocampa have been increasingly reported. Dogs living in pinewood areas are also frequently exposed to the caterpillar. This work consisted on a retrospective study of 41 cases of lepidopterism. All dogs presented drooling, dysphagia, submandibular lymphadenomegaly and clinical signs of pain. The animals were distributed in three groups, according to the time span from exposure to the caterpillar until presentation: up to 2 h (group 1), 2 - 5 h (group 2) and more than 5 h (group 3). All animals from groups 2 (n = 5) and 3 (n = 9), and eight dogs from group 1 (n = 27) developed lingual necrosis. Lepidopterism coursed through a predictable clinical pattern.

40|$|Background. Pine processionary larvae produce urticating hairs (setae) {{that serve}} for {{protection}} against predators. Setae induce cutaneous reactions in animals and humans. The presence of toxic or allergic mechanisms {{is a matter}} of debate. Objectives. To detect the presence of allergens in setae and to characterize them. Materials and methods. Setae extracts were characterized by gel staining and immunoblot, with sera from patients with immediate reactions and positive prick test reactions, as well as a rabbit antiserum raised against setae. Setae proteins were fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography. The most relevant allergen was analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS), and its sequence was deduced from an expressed sequence tag bank. Results. Setae contained at least seven different allergens. The most intense detection corresponded to a protein of MW ∼ 14 000 that was similar to thaumetopoein, a previously described protein with mast cell-degranulating properties. MALDI-MS-based de novo sequencing provided a partial amino acid sequence {{different from that of the}} previously described allergen Tha p 1, and it was named Tha p 2. This allergen was detected in 61 % of patients, and it is therefore a new major caterpillar allergen. Conclusions.

Tissues {{were collected from}} resulting abortions and near or full-term pregnancies consisting of 13 aborted fetuses, 3 fetuses from treated euthanized mares, membranes of 5 foals, and organs from 3 foals. Three control membranes and 1 control fetus and membranes were examined. Caterpillar setal fragments {{were present in the}} allantochorion of the 3 fetuses from the euthanized mares and 11 of 12 aborted fetuses (92 %) embedded in the chorion (villi or stroma) or allantois (vasculature or stroma). Placental locations of fragments ranged from the cervical pole region to the body encompassing the umbilical insertion and pregnant horn. Numbers in each fetus ranged from 1 to 7 fragments. Setae were present in the allantochorion from 2 to 22 days after the initial treatment. Acute to chronic active inflammation was present in all aborted fetuses, all euthanized fetuses, and within at least 1 tissue level (chorion, allantois, umbilical cord, or amnion) of the membranes from full-term foals. Amnionitis, funisitis, and allantoitis were present in 95 % of the examined membranes. Pneumonia was present in 95 % of the specimens, and bacteria were present histologically in 90. 5 % of the specimens with or without accompanying inflammation.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that plants can react to biotic aggressions with highly specific responses. However, {{few studies have}} attempted to jointly investigate whether the induction of plant defences is specific to a targeted plant tissue, plant species, herbivore identity, and defensive trait. Here we studied those factors contributing to the specificity of induced defensive responses in two economically impor- tant pine species against two chewing insect pest herbivores. Juvenile trees of Pinus pinaster andP. radiata were exposed to herbivory by two major pest threats, the large pine weevil Hylobius abietis (a bark-fee- der) and the pine <b>processionary</b> <b>caterpillar</b> Thaumetopoea pityocampa (a folivore). We quantified in two tissues (stem and needles) the constitutive (control plants) and herbivore-induced concentrations of total polyphenolics, volatile and non-volatile resin, {{as well as the}} profile of mono- and sesquiterpenes. Stem chewing by the pine weevil increased concentrations of non-volatile resin, volatile monoterpenes, and (marginally) polyphenolics in stem tissues. Weevil feeding also increased the concentration of non-vol- atile resin and decreased polyphenolics in the needle tissues. Folivory by the caterpillar had no major effects on needle defensive chemistry, but a strong increase in the concentration of polyphenolics in the stem. Interestingly, we found similar patterns for all these above-reported effects in both pine spe- cies. These results offer convincing evidence that induced defences are highly specific and may vary depending on the targeted plant tissue, the insect herbivore causing the damage and the considered defensive compound.

The microorganism used, a Pseudomonas sp., isolated from Pinus nigra, carries the cry 9 a toxin gene from Bacillus thuringiensis. In order to detect the GMM, specific primers were used, and a previously defined protocol for DNA isolation from bacteria colonizing pine needles was applied. The method, based on vortexing in a suspension of glass beads followed by microcolumn extractions, allowed sensitive PCR monitoring of the target transgenes. The presence of the released organism was recorded throughout the trial and compared with its entomocidal performance towards larvae of the pine <b>processionary</b> <b>caterpillar</b> Thaumetopoea pityocampa. At {{the same time the}} dynamics of the released Pseudomonas within the whole epiphytic bacterial community, was followed by amplifying 16 S rDNA pools and comparing ARDRA profiles at seven sampling points. The resulting dendrogram allowed to follow the time-dependent progressive blending of the Pseudomonas profile into those of the resident biota. PCR-dominance of the released bacterium in the community was extended until 21 days from release while its activity against insect larvae lasted for over 3 months. The prokaryotic epiphytic population, irrespective of any particular impact from the released strain, showed no resilience but a general successional trend, which, remarkably, appeared synchronous on all trees tested, including non-inoculated controls. This observation suggests interesting patterns of concerted environmental shifts by phyllospheric microorganisms...|$|R

Focal hyperplastic serositis was found in the duodenum, cecum, dorsal colon, and uteri of various mares occasionally with embedded setal fragments.

Inflammation in deeper tissues ranged from unapparent to neutrophilic (microabscesses), eosinophilic, or mononuclear (microgranulomas).

Were, we present life tables for egg batches and larval cohorts of the <b>processionary</b> <b>caterpillar</b> Ochrogaster lunifer Herrich-Schaffer, using intensive local sampling combined with extensive regional monitoring to ascertain the relative importance of different mortality factors at different localities. Extinction of entire cohorts (representing the entire reproductive output of one female) at natural localities was high, with 82 % of the initial 492 cohorts going extinct. Mortality was highest in the egg and early instar stages due to predation from dermestid beetles, and while different mortality factors (e. g. hatching failure, egg parasitism and failure to establish on the host) were present at many localities, dermestid predation, either directly observed or inferred from indirect evidence, was the dominant mortality factor at 89 % of localities surveyed. Predation was significantly higher in plantations than in natural habitats. The second most important mortality factor was resource depletion, with 14 cohorts defoliating their hosts. Egg and larval parasitism were not major mortality agents. A combination of predation and resource depletion consistently accounted for the majority of mortality across localities, suggesting that both factors are important in limiting population abundance. This evidence shows that O. lunifer is not regulated by natural enemies alone, but that resource patches (Acacia trees) ultimately, and frequently, act together to limit population growth...|$|R
