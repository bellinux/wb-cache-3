5|$|Barriers to {{reproduction}} {{between two}} diverging sexual populations {{are required for}} the populations to become new species. Gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations. Depending <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> two species have diverged since their most recent common ancestor, it may still be {{possible for them to}} produce offspring, as with horses and donkeys mating to produce mules. Such hybrids are generally infertile. In this case, closely related species may regularly interbreed, but hybrids will be selected against and the species will remain distinct. However, viable hybrids are occasionally formed and these new species can either have properties intermediate between their parent species, or possess a totally new phenotype. The importance of hybridisation in producing new species of animals is unclear, although cases have been seen in many types of animals, with the gray tree frog being a particularly well-studied example.|$|E

5|$|Had Flight 19 {{actually}} been where Taylor believed it to be, the flight {{would have made}} landfall with the Florida coastline within 20 minutes, depending <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> down they were. However, a later reconstruction of the incident showed that the islands visible to Taylor were probably the Bahamas, well northeast of the Keys, and that Flight 19 was exactly where it should have been. The board of investigation found that because of his belief {{that he was on}} a base course toward Florida, Taylor actually guided the flight farther northeast and out to sea. Further, it was general knowledge at NAS Fort Lauderdale that if a pilot ever became lost in the area to fly a heading of 270° west (or in evening hours toward the sunset if the compass had failed). By the time the flight actually turned west, they were likely so far out to sea they had already passed their aircraft's fuel endurance. This factor combined with bad weather, and the ditching characteristics of the Avenger, meant that there was little hope of rescue, even if they had managed to stay afloat.|$|E
5|$|While garnering the {{anticipation}} for the album, Big Sean released the mixtape Detroit on September 5, 2012. The mixtape consisted of previously unreleased songs. The mixtape features guest appearances from fellow rappers J.

Production {{was provided by}} Hit-Boy, Da Internz, Lex Luger and Key Wane. Before the album's release, Big Sean released a handful of his inspirational video blogs, which gets in touch <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> he has gotten to where he’s at throughout his career and what he plans on doing to further his position in music. Most of his vlogs feature cameo appearances from Kanye West, 2 Chainz, Pusha T, Common, No I.D., Rita Ora, Trey Songz, Wale, Wiz Khalifa, Lupe Fiasco, Teyana Taylor and T-Pain, among others. Starting on February 23, 2013, Sean began a European tour in promotion of the album, which continued until March 13, 2013. On September 28, 2013, Sean released a 23-minute documentary covering the development and making of the album, which began 269 days before the project's release.|$|E

25|$|C. The All-Ireland Senior Football Championship is {{the premier}} inter-county competition, contested by 31 of Ireland's 32 {{counties}} (plus New York and London). Each county participates {{in their respective}} provincial championship (in Derry's case the Ulster Championship) which operate through a knock-out cup competition format. The winners {{of each of the}} four Provincial Championships earn one of eight places in the All-Ireland quarter-finals. The 28 teams that fail to win their respective provincial championships receive a second opportunity to reach the All-Ireland quarter-finals via the All Ireland Qualifiers. The counties enter the Qualifiers at different stages (depending <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> they reached in their provincial championship). Four teams come through this system and join the four provincial champions in the All-Ireland quarter-finals. See here for more details.|$|E
25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta depends <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and {{can sit in}} the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area.

If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E

On 5 September 2011, three prefectures—Aomori, Fukushima and Ibaraki—were unable to hold the drills before March 2012.
