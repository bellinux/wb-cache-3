40|$|Aggregation between {{suspended}} particulate matter (SPM) and oil droplets, {{which leads to the}} formation of Oil-SPM Aggregates (OSA), is widely acknowledged as a natural process that enhances dispersion of spilled oil in aquatic environments. A new laboratory study was performed to investigate the formation of OSA using the Standard Reference Material 1941 b. The experiments were performed using Arabian Medium, Alaska North Slope and South Louisiana crudes. Sediment concentrations varied from 25 to 300 mg/L. A new procedure was developed to separate the OSAs from the bulk water, measure the <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in OSAs by GC-FID analysis, and isolate the sediment trapped in sinking OSAs for gravimetric quantification. Results showed that this method is appropriate for measuring small amounts (less than 2 mg in this study) of <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in OSAs and does not overestimate the mass of <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in large OSAs as observed in a previous method based on image analysis. For the three oils, results showed also that the percentage of <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in sinking OSAs increases rapidly from about 0. 5 % to about 30 % of the initial oil mass when sediment concentration increases from 25 to 100 mg/l. Further increase of sediment concentration to 300 mg/l showed slower increase of <b>oil</b> <b>trapping</b> to reach about 40 to 50 % {{depending on the type of}} oil. Measurements of the mass of sediment trapped in OSAs showed that the highest trapping efficiency is obtained when the sediment to oil ratio is close to 0. 5. This value decreases exponentially with oil density. ...|$|R

40|$|Previous oil {{containment}} booms have an {{open top}} that allows natural gas to escape, and have significant oil leakage due to wave action. Also, a subsea pyramid <b>oil</b> <b>trap</b> exists, but cannot move relative to moving oil plumes from deepsea oil leaks. The solution is to have large, moveable oil traps. One version floats on the sea surface and has a flexible tarp cover and a lower weighted skirt to completely entrap the floating oil and natural gas. The device must have at least three sides with boats pulling at each apex, and sonar or other system to track the slowly moving oil plume, so that the boats can properly locate the booms. The <b>oil</b> <b>trap</b> device must also have a means for removal of the oil and the natural gas. A second design version has a flexible pyramid cover that is attached by lines to ballast on the ocean floor. This is similar to fixed, metal pyramid oil capture devices in the Santa Barbara Channel {{off the coast of}} California. The ballast lines for the improved design, however, would have winches that can move the pyramid to always be located above the oil and gas plume. A third design is a combination of the first two. It uses a submerged pyramid to trap oil, but has no anchor and uses boats to locate the trap. It has ballast weights located along the bottom of the tarp and/or at the corners of the trap. The improved floating oil-spill containment device has a large floating boom and weighted skirt surrounding the oil and gas entrapment area. The device is triangular (or more than three sides) and has a flexible tarp cover with a raised gas vent area. Boats pull on the apex of the triangles to maintain tension and to allow the device to move to optimum locations to trap oil and gas. The gas is retrieved from a higher buoyant part of the tarp, and oil is retrieved from the floating oil layer contained in the device. These devices can be operated in relatively severe weather, since waves will break over the devices without causing oil leaking. Also, natural gas is entrapped and can be retrieved. All designs can use sonar to locate the moving oil plume, and then be relocated by using boats or winches to move the oil trapping devices. These devices can be constructed of treated, non-permeable DuPont Kevlar cloth (or similar material) ...|$|E

Sedimentary sequences in Charak-Namakin anticlines are known as important geological units which have been selected for prospecting oil related reservoirs by National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) in 2002. Gravimetric datasets have been acquired by NIOC systematic land surveys in a total of 776 stations. The main target areas along Charak- Namakin salt domes are located between 54. 00 - 54. 30 and 27. 00 - 28. 45 geographic longitude and latitudes. Both Asmari (Oligocene) and Pabdeh- Gurpi formations (early Cenozoic) contain limestones with gray marls intercalations as potentially valuable facies for hosting of hydrocarbore reservoirs under ascending movements of the Paleozoic formations in diapiric systems.

40|$|AbstractThe {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} {{has a long history of}} evaluating the adequacy of subsurface traps for containing buoyant fluids and has developed methods for weighing the geologic probability of trap leakage when limited data are available. We have adapted these methods for evaluating the adequacy of sub-surface saline formation traps for CO 2 storage. A principal difference in the evaluation for gas and oil exploration versus CO 2 storage is that the probability of leakage is viewed differently. The oil and {{gas industry}} tolerates substantial leak probabilities in exploration if the potential gas or oil accumulation is sufficiently large, but the tolerance for CO 2 leakage (i. e. the probability of injected CO 2 returning to the surface) will likely be much lower, and that low tolerance has the potential to limit the amount of CO 2 injected into a subsurface trap. We consider three types of saline formation traps: â¢Depleted gas or oil fieldsâ¢Drilled trap structures that failed to discover commercial gas or oil volumesâ¢Undrilled trap structures Each of these types has some probability of CO 2 leakage, but the geologic probability is smaller and better constrained in depleted gas or oil fields and greater and more uncertain in untested structures. However, each of these trap types still possess some geologic probability of leakage. We evaluate the overall probability by considering for each trap element (e. g., capillary seal capacity) the likelihood that each element is adequately developed and the quality and quantity of data available to make that judgment. By following procedures applied to gas and <b>oil</b> <b>trap</b> evaluation, we arrive at probability distributions for a range of CO 2 fill limits. What this analysis reveals, however, is that if we fill traps with CO 2 to levels with minimal probability of CO 2 leakage, the volume of CO 2 that could be stored in subsurface traps is small. Moreover, all traps will, on average, have huge remaining pore volumes that could accommodate additional CO 2 storage and could go unfilled (i. e. pore volumes with a higher probability of leakage). We propose an evaluation method based on a series of redundant traps in a fill-leak sequence. The purpose of secondary and tertiary traps arranged in series is that they allow for filling the primary trap to its uncertain fill limit while minimizing the chance of leakage to the surface...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{safety and}} {{environment}} protection play {{key role in}} the sustainable development of our country. As an environment friendly renewable energy, bodiesel is considered as a promising alternative of fossil diesel. Refined rapeseed and soybean oils in China are too expensive to make biodiesel competitive in the market. High price of feedstock becomes the bottleneck for biodiesel development. This research focus on the utilization of low cost feed stock, such as used frying <b>oil,</b> <b>trap</b> grease, soap stock and jatropha oil with high acid value. Comparison and optimization of the technologies related to different feedstocks have been conducted in this work. Biodiesel production from used frying oil and trap grease via acid catalysis was carried out in a pressurized reactor. Through central rotatable design, two quadric polynomial models were obtained. Methanol, sulfuric acid loading and the reaction time were the significant factors influenced the ester content of the biodiesel. This result provided reliable data for acid catalyzed both esterification and transesterification. Studies on the activity of solid acid (Amberlyst- 15) concluded that used frying oil could be esterified at 60 â and jatropha oil with about 5 % free fatty acids, trap grease with 50 % free fatty acids should be treated at 90 â, 95 â. A novel separation process of soapstock at room temperature was developed through dilution with water, pH control of the followed acidulation. Yield of acid oil can be achieved at 97 % and 91 ~ 93 % based on fresh soapstock and fermented soapstock respectively. Water content of excess methanol and reaction time were taken as two independent variables, the acid values of jatropha oil were taken as response surface, and a quadric polynomial model was established through a full factorial design. A high efficient method was developed by 20 verification experiments carried out based on this model. The total sulfuric acid and the average reaction time were decreased significantly, which is valueble for biodiesel commercialization using jatropha oil as feedstock. A small pilot plant with a capacity of 200 tons/year was designed {{based on the results of}} the experiments in the laboratory. Tung oil with an acid value of 7. 12 mgKOH/g was esterified in the fixed reactor, and then it was transesterified in the plug flow reactor continuously. Economic analysis showed that the profitability of biodiesel production from trap grease was sensitive to the change of prices of trap grease and biodiesel. Budget deficit is expected if the price of trap grease increases 10 % or the price of biodiesel decreases 10 % while other factors are stable. The effect of biodiesel price is more significant than the price of trap grease. The change of methanol and glycerol price is less important because of the sum of them relative to the trap grease and biodiesel is small. ä¿è¯è½æºå®å¨åæ§å¶ç¯å¢æ±¡ææ¯æå½å®ç°å¯æç»­åå±çåæï¼çç©æ´æ²¹ä½ä¸ºç¯å¢åå¥½çå¯åçè½æºå·²ç»æä¸ºéç¹ç ç©¶å¼åçä¸ç§åç³çæçæ¿ä»£åãç®åæ¬§ç¾æ®éä½¿ç¨çå¤§è±æ²¹åèç±½æ²¹å¨ä¸­å½æ²¹æå¸åºä»·æ ¼æè´µï¼åæææ¬è¿é«æ¯æå½çç©æ´æ²¹åä¸åçäº§çç¶é¢ãæ¬ç ç©¶æ ¹æ®å·æä»£è¡¨æ§ççç¸åºæ²¹ãå°æ²æ²¹ãè±æ²¹çèåé«é¸ä»·éº»ç¯æ æ²¹ç­ä½ä»·ä½ãé«é¸ä»·çç©æ´æ²¹çäº§åæçåèªç¹ç¹ï¼éåäºä¸åå·¥èºè¿è¡äºçç©æ´æ²¹çåæç ç©¶ã ä½¿ç¨æ¿åååºè£ç½®ï¼å¨é¸å¬ååçä½ç¨ä¸ï¼å®æäºå©ç¨çç¸åºæ²¹åå°æ²æ²¹ä¸æ­¥æ³çäº§çç©æ´æ²¹çä¼åå®éªãéè¿æè½¬ä¸­å¿ç»æå®éªè®¾è®¡åç»æåæï¼å¾å°äºä¸¤ä¸ªäºæ¬¡å¤é¡¹å¼æ¨¡åãç»æè¯æå¨ç¡®å®ååºæ¸©åº¦çæ¡ä»¶ä¸ï¼ç²éå å¥éãå¬ååç¨éåååºæ¶é´å¨ååºè¿ç¨å³å®äºäº§ç©ç²é¯å«éï¼è¿æ ·ä¸ºé¸å¬ååæ­¥é¯ååé¯äº¤æ¢ååºæä¾äºå¹¿æ³éç¨ççè®ºä¾æ®ã æ¯è¾ç ç©¶äºç¡«é¸ååºä½é¸å¬ååï¼Amberlyst- 15 ï¼å¨çç¸åºæ²¹ãå°æ²æ²¹åé«é¸ä»·éº»ç¯æ æ²¹é¢é¯åè¿ç¨çå¬åææï¼æ»ç»åºå©ç¨åºä½é¸å¬ååå¨ 60 âå®æçç¸åºæ²¹çé¢é¯åï¼å¨ 90 âå 95 âå®æéº»ç¯æ æ²¹åå°æ²æ²¹çé¢é¯åçä¸¤æ¡ç»¿è²å·¥èºè·¯çº¿ã éè¿åç¨æ°´ç¨éè±æ²¹çèï¼åæ§å¶ç¡«é¸å å¥éåº¦åå å¥éçæ¹å¼ï¼å¨å®¤æ¸©æ¡ä»¶ä¸åç¦»åºè±æ²¹çèåçæ¸¸ç¦»èèªé¸åçæ²¹é¯ï¼é¸åæ²¹ï¼ãå¯¹äºæªåéµçèï¼åç¦»çè¾¾ 97 %ï¼å¯¹äºåéµçèï¼åç¦»çä¸º 91 ~ 93 %ã éè¿å¨æå å®éªè®¾è®¡åå®éªç»æåæï¼å»ºç«ä»¥è¿éç²éåå«æ°´éåååºæ¶é´ä¸ºèªåéï¼ä»¥é¢é¯ååéº»ç¯æ æ²¹çé¸å¼ä¸ºå åéçäºæ¬¡å¤é¡¹å¼æ¨¡åãè®¾å®é¢é¯ååéº»ç¯æ æ²¹çé¸å¼ï¼æ ¹æ®æ¨¡åå®æçè®ºè®¡ç®ï¼å¾å°éå¤ä½¿ç¨è¿éç²éåç¡«é¸é¢é¯åéº»ç¯æ æ²¹æéè¦çååºæ¶é´ï¼å¹¶éè¿å®éç 20 æ¬¡å®éªéªè¯äºè¯¥æ¨¡åçåç¡®æ§åå®ç¨æ§ãè¯¥é¢å¤çæ¹æ³åå°äºç¡«é¸å å¥æ»éï¼ç¼©ç­äºååºæ¶é´ï¼å¯¹å®éå·¥ä¸åçäº§å·æåºç¨ä»·å¼ã å¨å°è¯å®éªæ°æ®çåºç¡ä¸è®¾è®¡å®æå¹´äº§ 200 å¨çç©æ´æ²¹çå°åä¸­é´è¯éªè£ç½®ï¼å¹¶å©ç¨åºä½é¸å¬ååå¨è¯¥è£ç½®ä¸è¿è¡äºé¸å¼ä¸º 7. 12 mgKOH/gçæ¡æ²¹é¢é¯åååºå®éªï¼åéåå¨æ´»å¡æµååºå¨ä¸çç¢±å¬åè½¬é¯åååºã åä¸åçäº§çææ¯åæè¡¨æï¼å°æ²æ²¹åçç©æ´æ²¹çä»·æ ¼ååå¯¹é¡¹ç®ç»æµæççå½±åè¡¨ç°å¾ææãå¶å®å ç´ ä¸åçæåµä¸ï¼å°æ²æ²¹ä»·æ ¼å¢å  10 %æçç©æ´æ²¹éä½ 10 %é½ä¼åºç°äºæãä»äºæé¢ä¸åæï¼çç©æ´æ²¹çå¸åºä»·æ ¼å¯¹çå©è½åå½±åæ´å¤§ãç²éåçæ²¹çååå¯¹çå©æ°´å¹³å½±åè¾å°ï¼ä¸»è¦æ¯å ä¸ºæ¯å®ä»¬å¨æ´ä¸ªç©æå¹³è¡¡è¿ç¨ä¸­ç©è´¨æ»éç¸å¯¹äºå°æ²æ²¹åçç©æ´æ²¹...|$|E
30|$|Thus, the mixed-wet system {{significantly}} trapped smaller {{amount of}} residual oil compared to oil-wet system, {{which is consistent}} with Amottâs finding that extreme wettability results in high residual oil, whereas weakly water-wet conditions or slightly oil-wet conditions result in low residual oil. It may be that the mixed wet system <b>trapped</b> less residual <b>oil</b> {{as a result of the}} oil-wet solid surface that allows the oil blobs that are close to each other to connect and form a continuous flow path. As such, an oil-wet solid surface prevents water from forming a continuous thin film, and prevents snap-off. Likewise, the <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in the smaller pores is reduced as compared to an oil-wet system, because the small pores in a mixed-wettability system are water-filled Anderson (1987). According to Anderson (1987), as compared to the water-wet system, the mixed-wet system <b>traps</b> less <b>oil</b> because it <b>traps</b> less <b>oil</b> in the larger oil-wet pores. However, in this experiment, there was no significant difference between the percent <b>oil</b> <b>trapping</b> in mixed-wet (16.39 Â %) and water-wet systems (17.72 Â %). The residual oil was as small as that of the water-wet system or perhaps even smaller, suggesting that global phase trapping in porous media (residual saturation) is sensitive to the wetting characteristics of the solid matrix. Moreover, the saturation history of oil might affect the amount of residual <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> after the water injection, as the amount of oil saturation of the acrylic bead packs (91.68 Â %) was higher than that of mixed-bead packs (85.92 Â %), resulting in higher residual oil saturation.|$|R

40|$|At LuleÃ¥ airport urea {{is used as}} {{deicing agent}} as it dissolves ice {{coatings}} by lowering the freezing point of water. Urea occur natural in water courses and soils {{as the result of}} excretion and degradation of nucleic acids and proteins. The contents are usually low in the natural environment. Large amount of urea were added because of the deicing, 145 tons in the season 2009 / 2010. Urea consists of 46 % nitrogen which occurs as ammonium whose emissions can lead to eutrophication and can be toxic for organisms in high contents. In a study from SGU in 1996 it was showed that a maximum of 10 % of the urea nitrogen from LuleÃ¥ airport leaks in to Bottenviken every year, which suggests that {{the main part of the}} urea nitrogen infiltrate into the ground, is taken up by plants or leaves as nitrogen gas through denitrification. LuleÃ¥ airport has two infiltrations ponds, the north and the south, where all of the airports stormwater sewers link together. Approximately 75 % of the stormwater that drains from LuleÃ¥ airport runs to the south infiltration pond where an <b>oil</b> <b>trap</b> is placed as a first cleaning step. In 2008 an overflow trench was built between the south infiltration pond and the recipient Lulkroksviken to prevent the flooding that regularly took place, causing forest damages. Only the south infiltration pond with its associated overflow trench was included in this thesis. At the same time as the overflow trench was built a sharp edged weir with a pressure sensor were installed in a well placed at the outlet of the trench to measure the flow that passes. In 2010 a control program to assess the direct emissions from the airport area to the recipient through stormwater started, including regular sampling of the overflow water and analysis of the total nitrogen, total phosphorus, suspended solids, conductivity and pH. Also included in the control program were to sample some elements, PFOS and oil compounds at some occasions to get an entire comprehension of the water quality and possible contaminant transport. The control program for 2010 was performed as a master thesis. The purpose with the thesis was to identify potential contaminations, quantify emissions of the analyzed elements and pollutions to the recipient. A part of the thesis work has been to quality assurance the flow measurements. The sample program focused on nitrogen because urea is used as deicing agent at the airports runway, taxiways and aprons. The results showed that approximately 1 ton of nitrogen passed through the overflow trench and run out into Lulkroksviken. The fraction for October is roughly equivalent with earlier surveys. The analyses of total phosphorus and the elements showed low values except from copper. The oil compounds were under the reporting limit. PFOS was found in the water with an average concentration of 140 ng/l and their source is uncertain. The pressure sensor from Norconsult that measured the over flow has under October given 1. 2 - 2. 3 times larger over flow value than the pressure sensor from ISCO that was installed under the same time. This has resulted in an estimated smaller waterflow from April to September compared to when only the pressure sensor from Norconsult was installed. Validerat; 20111221 (anonymous...|$|E
30|$|A {{critical}} rate was noticed through this experimental study. Above the critical flow rate, higher injection rate adversely affects the displacement through fingering. However, {{it should be}} noted that increasing the flow rate up to the critical value is helpful because of the greater effect of viscous force to overcome the capillary force, which is known as the <b>oil</b> <b>trapping</b> force.|$|R

30|$|As it is {{observed}} in this, due to the high viscosity of polymer solution comparing to water injection which was shown before in Fig. 8, there is less residual <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> {{in the corners of}} pores and specifically in throats leading to a better displacement efficiency with minimum oil-bypassing during the injection. This figure shows the efficiency of polymer flooding in systems with more realistic flow patterns.|$|R
30|$|Oil {{displacement}} {{efficiency is}} {{the combination of the}} macroscopic efficiency and the microscopic efficiency. Macroscopic efficiency is the volumetric effect of the displacing fluid(s) in contacting oil zone, while microscopic displacement uses capillary forces to effectively mobile <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> at pore scale. Therefore, the purpose of oil displacement during polymer flooding is to improve the macroscopic and microscopic displacement efficiency to improve oil recovery (Romero-Zeron 2012).|$|R
30|$|Four typical {{types of}} {{residual}} <b>oil,</b> residual <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in dead ends, oil ganglia in pore throats, oil at pore corners and oil film adhered to pore walls, were studied. According to main pore structure characteristics and the fundamental morphological features of residual oil, four displacement models for residual oil were proposed, in which pore-scale flow behavior of viscoelastic fluid was analyzed by a numerical method and micro-mechanisms for mobilization of residual oil were discussed. Calculated {{results indicate that}} the viscoelastic effect enhances micro displacement efficiency and increases swept volume. For residual <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in dead ends, the flow field of viscoelastic fluid is developed in dead ends more deeply, resulting in more contact with oil by the displacing fluid, and consequently increasing swept volume. In addition, intense viscoelastic vortex has great stress, under which residual oil becomes small oil ganglia, and finally be carried into main channels. For residual oil at pore throats, its displacement mechanisms are similar to the <b>oil</b> <b>trapped</b> in dead ends. Vortices are developed {{in the depths of the}} throats and oil ganglia become smaller. Besides, viscoelastic fluid causes higher pressure drop on oil ganglia, as a driving force, which can overcome capillary force, consequently, flow direction can be changed and the displacing fluid enter smaller throats. For oil at pore corners, viscoelastic fluid can enhance displacement efficiency as a result of greater velocity and stress near the corners. For residual oil adhered to pore wall, viscoelastic fluid can provide a greater displacing force on the interface between viscoelastic fluid and oil, thus, making it easier to exceed the minimum interfacial tension for mobilizing the oil film.|$|R
