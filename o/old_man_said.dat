5|$|Like many English {{football}} clubs, Aston Villa {{have had}} several hooligan firms associated with them: Villa Youth, Steamers, Villa Hardcore and the C-Crew, the last mentioned being very active during the 1970s and 1980s. As {{can be seen}} across the whole of English football, the hooligan groups have now been marginalised. In 2004, several Villa firms {{were involved in a}} fight with QPR fans outside Villa Park in which a steward died. The main groupings of supporters can now be found in a number of domestic and international supporters' clubs. This includes the Official Aston Villa Supporters Club which also has many smaller regional and international sections. There were several independent supporters clubs during the reign of Doug Ellis but most of these disbanded after his retirement. The supporter group My <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Said</b> formed to stand up for Villa supporters' rights, {{as a direct result of}} Villa supporters' protest against the club's appointment of Alex McLeish. The club's supporters also publish fanzines such as Heroes and Villains and The Holy Trinity.|$|E
500|$|Matilda Alice Victoria Wood (12 February 1870– 7 October 1922), professionally {{known as}} Marie Lloyd was an English music hall singer, comedian and musical theatre actress. She {{was best known}} for her {{performances}} of songs such as [...] "The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery", [...] "My <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> (<b>Said</b> Follow the Van)" [...] and [...] "Oh Mr Porter What Shall I Do". [...] She received both criticism and praise for her use of innuendo and double entendre during her performances, but enjoyed a long and prosperous career, during which she was affectionately called the [...] "Queen of the Music Hall".|$|E
500|$|Lloyd had a {{turbulent}} private {{life that was}} often the subject of press attention: she was married three times, divorced twice, and frequently found herself giving court testimony against two of her husbands who had physically abused her. [...] In later life, {{she was still in}} demand at music halls and had a late success in 1919 with her performance of [...] "My <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> (<b>Said</b> Follow the Van)", which became one of her most popular songs. Privately, she suffered from bouts of ill-health and became alcohol-dependent, both of which imposed restrictions on her performing career by the 1920s. [...] In 1922, she gave her final performance at the Alhambra Theatre, London, during which she became ill on stage. She died a few days later at the age of 52.|$|E

500|$|In July 1916, Dillon was conscripted {{into the}} army, but disliked the {{discipline}} of regimental life. He applied for exemption on the grounds he had to look after his parents and four brothers, but his claim was rejected. In a later failed attempt, he tried to convince army officials {{that he was too}} obese to carry out military duties. [...] On the rare occasions when Dillon was allowed home on leave, he would often indulge in drinking sessions. [...] One night, Lloyd's friend Bella Burge received a knock at the front door to find a hysterical Lloyd covered in blood and bruises. [...] When asked to explain what had caused her injuries, she stated that she had caught Dillon in bed with another woman and had had a showdown with her husband. By 1917, Dillon's drinking had become worse. That June, two constables were called to Lloyd and Dillon's house in Golders Green after Dillon committed a drunken assault on his wife. [...] Police entered the house and found Lloyd and her maid cowering beneath a table. [...] Dillon confronted the constables and assaulted one of them, which resulted in him being taken to court, fined and sentenced to a month's hard labour. Lloyd began drinking to escape the trauma of her domestic abuse. [...] That year, she was earning £470 per week performing in music halls and making special appearances. By 1918, she had become popular with the British-based American soldiers, but had failed to capture the spirits of their English counterparts, and began feeling sidelined by her peers; Vesta Tilley had led a very successful recruitment drive into the services, and other music hall performers had been honoured by royalty. The following year, she performed perhaps her best known song, [...] "My <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> (<b>Said</b> Follow the Van)", which was written for her by Fred W. Leigh and Charles Collins. [...] The song depicts a mother fleeing her home to avoid the rent man. [...] The lyrics reflected the hardships of working class life in London {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, and gave her the chance to costume the character in a worn out dress and black straw boater, while carrying a birdcage.|$|E
2500|$|I told Foster I {{should hold}} {{him for the}} money, and the old man, Van Triplett, said we acted as if we could not trust him, and gave {{some of the money}} back, and then said he would give us a chance to win it , so Foster turned the right card and [...] started to give him the money, but said, ‘Supposing you had bet that in earnest, did you have the money to put up?’ Foster said, ‘No,’ and turning to me said, ‘You have the money,’ and I said no, I did not have any money; that he took it all, but he said, ‘You have some dust,’ and wanted me to get it just to show the old man that we had the money in case the bet had been a real one. Bowers and I went to Kaufman’s store to get the money and Van Triplett and Foster {{remained}} behind. We came back with the dust and I unrolled it and showed them the sack, and the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> he did not know if that was gold, and Bowers said, ‘Open it and show it to him, as he don’t know gold dust when he sees it,’ but I did not open it, and [...] just about to roll it up again, when Foster grabbed it and handing it to the <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> <b>said,</b> “Git!” and I started to grab the old man when they held me and said if I made a noise it would not be well for me. I pulled away from them and started after the old man, but could not see him and then went across the street and asked a party where there was an officer: that I had been robbed of $3,000 by some men over there.|$|E

[...] How an Indian had {{hidden behind a}} log on the river bank and shot him through the groin while steering a houseboat on the Kiskiminetas River but {{a few miles from}} The Wigwam. [...] He asked the Chief how he would explain such a wholly uncalled-for criminal act. [...] Slow to reply, the Chief wanted to ask if this man was a soldier. [...] Told that he had been a captain in the Revolution, the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> that either the Indian knew the white man, or was drunk when he did the shooting. [...] Investigation of the affair showed that the Indian had been in Pittsburgh and had been drinking that day. [...] But, as the captain shot the Indian, both assailant and victim were dead and nothing was done or could be done about it.|$|E

2500|$|The second tale, {{related by}} the travel writer Will R. Bird, occurs {{at a time}} when men from the north shore of the Minas Basin used to cross the water to buy horses from farmers in the Annapolis Valley. During his summer travels in the late 1950s, Bird {{encountered}} an oldtimer on a farm near the Parrsboro golf course across the harbour from Partridge Island. [...] "You ever hear of our sea horse?" [...] the oldtimer asked. [...] "There ain't nothing to match it in Nova Scotia." [...] The story begins when Tom Smith crosses over to buy a mare from a man in Canning. The mare then had a black foal that [...] "was one of the finest ever seen on this shore." [...] After about seven years, the farmer from Canning showed up at Smith's farm and, obviously regretting that he had sold the mare, he offered Smith [...] "more'n twice the going price" [...] for his fast, black horse. [...] "Tom was a man who watched the dollars and he just couldn't resist," [...] the oldtimer said. The farmer from Canning took the boat back while Smith drove the horse around the Basin to deliver it. [...] "He was no more'n back home," [...] the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "when he happened to look toward the pasture and there was the black horse. Tom couldn't believe his eyes." [...] When he went down to the beach, he saw hoof marks showing where the animal had come ashore. Apparently, the horse had known to wait for low tide before attempting the crossing, but, it [...] "made a mighty long swim just the same." [...] The story ends with Smith returning to Canning to give the money back. [...] "He told the man he couldn't sell a horse that wanted to be with him that much, and the stranger agreed." ...|$|E
