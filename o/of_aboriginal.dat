5|$|The Supreme Court of the United States, under Chief Justice Roger B. Taney (1836–1864), issued several {{important}} {{decisions on the}} status <b>of</b> <b>aboriginal</b> title in the United States, building on the opinions <b>of</b> <b>aboriginal</b> title in the Marshall Court.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the case}} has not been {{formally}} overruled, two Supreme Court decisions in the 1970s and 1980s have undone its effect by ruling that there is federal subject-matter jurisdiction for a federal common law cause of action for recovering possession based on the common-law doctrine <b>of</b> <b>aboriginal</b> title. Moreover, the New York courts' interpretation of the Nonintercourse Act is no longer good law. Modern federal courts hold that only Congress can ratify a conveyance <b>of</b> <b>aboriginal</b> title, and only with a clear statement, rather than implicitly.|$|E

5|$|The 2011 Canadian Census {{enumerated}} 1,400,685 Aboriginal {{people in}} Canada, 4.3% of the country's total population. This total comprises 851,560 people of First Nations descent, 451,795 Métis, and 59,445 Inuit. National representative bodies <b>of</b> <b>Aboriginal</b> people in Canada include the Assembly of First Nations, the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Métis National Council, the Native Women's Association of Canada, the National Association of Native Friendship Centres and the Congress <b>of</b> <b>Aboriginal</b> Peoples.|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal {{versions}} of the story also exist. In 1987, an elderly Aboriginal man from nearby Kingston related {{a version of the}} story, in which Brown shot some Aboriginal people and poisoned others because they were stealing his sheep. Brown then established his alibi by riding to Adelaide. In the same year Hastings' account was reproduced verbatim in Tom McCourt and Hans Mincham's The Coorong and Lakes of the Lower Murray. Three years later, the South Australian Education Department published an Aboriginal studies book for secondary students. It repeated Hastings' version, and followed it with an Aboriginal version told by a Ngarrindjeri man, George Trevorrow, whose family were from the Guichen Bay area. Trevorrow described the exploitation <b>of</b> <b>Aboriginal</b> workers by white settlers, and stated that when times were lean, Aboriginal people would steal flour from landowners. He did not name Brown, but stated that a settler poisoned some flour and rode for Adelaide to establish an alibi. Foster et al. note that while these two accounts were similar, the difference was that Hastings portrayed Brown as a victim <b>of</b> <b>Aboriginal</b> attacks, while Trevorrow emphasised white exploitation <b>of</b> <b>Aboriginal</b> people.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Saunders was demobilised and {{returned}} to civilian life.

In 1971, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his community service. He died in 1990, aged 69.|$|E
5|$|In July 2016, a BLM rally was {{organized}} in Melbourne, Australia, in which 3,500 people attended. The protest also emphasized {{on the issues}} of mistreatment <b>of</b> <b>Aboriginal</b> Australians by the Australian police and government.|$|E
5|$|As of the 2011 census, Aboriginal {{peoples in}} Canada totaled 1,400,685 people, or 4.3% of the {{national}} population, spread over 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands with distinctive cultures, languages, art, and music. National Indigenous Peoples Day recognizes the cultures and contributions <b>of</b> <b>Aboriginal</b> peoples {{to the history of}} Canada.

5|$|On 27 May 1849, {{stores were}} taken from a hut on Thomas Cooper Horn's station and a hutkeeper and {{shepherd}} were threatened by Aboriginal people, who left with the goods they had taken. The station owner {{and some of his}} station hands pursued the group, and when they caught up with the fleeing party <b>of</b> <b>Aboriginal</b> people shots were fired and spears thrown. The Aboriginal group split in two, and Horn and his men followed one party to the Waterloo Bay cliffs, which the group tried to climb down in order to make their escape. Horn and his men opened fire, and two Aboriginal people were killed and one was fatally wounded, with several more being captured. The Government Resident and the police inspector from Port Lincoln both wrote detailed accounts of the incident, neither of which mentioned a large number of casualties. One specified that only two Aboriginal people were killed. In September, a group <b>of</b> <b>Aboriginal</b> men were transported to Adelaide for trial. Two were convicted of the murder of Beevor, and were transported back to the Elliston district where they were hanged outside his hut. Three were charged with the murder of Easton, but were acquitted due to lack of evidence. A number of others were charged over the confrontation at the hut on Horn's station. Shortly after this, two more Aboriginal men were arrested in Port Lincoln by the police and charged with the murder of Hamp. Found guilty and sentenced to death, they were later released when doubts were raised about the testimony <b>of</b> <b>Aboriginal</b> witnesses located by the police. In February 1852 another Aboriginal male was arrested as an accomplice in Hamp's murder, but after being transported to Adelaide, he too was released due to lack of evidence. He tried to walk home to his country, and was murdered by four Aboriginal men for trespassing.|$|E

5|$|The Dutch {{soon found}} trade in deerskins and venison in the East Asian market to be a lucrative {{endeavor}} and recruited Plains Aborigines to procure the hides. The deer trade attracted the first Han traders to aboriginal villages, but {{as early as}} 1642 the demand for deer greatly diminished the deer stocks. This drop significantly reduced the prosperity <b>of</b> <b>aboriginal</b> peoples, forcing many aborigines to take up farming to counter {{the economic impact of}} losing their most vital food source.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Court (18011835) issued {{some of the}} {{earliest}} and most influential opinions by the Supreme Court of the United States on the status <b>of</b> <b>aboriginal</b> title in the United States, several of them written by Chief Justice John Marshall himself. However, without exception, the remarks of the Court on aboriginal title during this period are dicta.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of 19th- and 20th-century missionaries has both transformed and maintained aboriginal integration. Many {{of the churches}} have replaced earlier community functions, but continue to retain a sense of continuity and community that unites members <b>of</b> <b>aboriginal</b> societies against the pressures of modernity. Several church leaders have emerged from within the communities to take on leadership positions in petitioning {{the government in the}} interest of indigenous peoples and seeking a balance between the interests of the communities and economic vitality.|$|E

5|$|The {{respondents}} {{also noted}} that Gaudron made similar comments in the Stolen Generations case, which also considered non-judicial detention in the context <b>of</b> <b>Aboriginal</b> children who were forcibly removed from their parents' care.

5|$|Archæological {{evidence}} from the Birrigai rock shelter in Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve indicates habitation dating back at least 21,000 years.

Another site of significance in the reserve is the Bogong Rocks shelter, which contains the oldest evidence <b>of</b> <b>Aboriginal</b> occupation at a bogong moth resting site. These insects were an important source of food for the Aboriginal peoples of the Southern Alps and would accumulate by the thousands in caves and rock crevices, where they were collected and later roasted in sand or ashes, and then eaten whole.|$|E
