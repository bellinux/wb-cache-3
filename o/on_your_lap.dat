You make the jolliest motive.’ And you reply: ‘Well, I don’t mind, if I may smoke.’ And thereafter the hours go idly by. Your friend at the easel labours doggedly a little way off, in the wide shadow of the tree; and yet farther, across a strait of glaring sunshine, you see another painter, encamped in the shadow of another tree, and up to his waist in the fern. You cannot watch your own effigy growing out of the white trunk, and the trunk beginning to stand forth {{from the rest of the}} wood, and the whole picture getting dappled over with the flecks of sun that slip through the leaves overhead, and, as a wind goes by and sets the trees a-talking, flicker hither and thither like butterflies of light. But you know it is going forward; and, out of emulation with the painter, get ready your own palette, and lay out the colour for a woodland scene in words.|$|E

5000|$|Aside from cost, {{safety is}} the primary reason that a dunk tank might not be {{permitted}} at a given event. If the operator(s) is/are not fully trained or not giving the proper instructions, people have been injured on occasion. General safety guidelines include keeping hands off {{any part of the}} tank assembly - some rental companies recommend keeping hands <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>lap</b> when sitting on a dunk tank. Grasping the seat could result in pinched fingers when the seat falls, and holding on {{to the side of the}} tank or enclosure could cause arm and shoulder injuries when falling in. There is also a slight risk of slipping on the bottom of the tank, so some rental companies recommend wearing shoes or sandals.|$|E

It quickly became apparent that Norman was not feral, but fearful. Shelter staff worked with him for many months to get him comfortable with them, and then continued to work with him to become comfortable with other people. Eventually Norman took an active role in the shelter, acting as receptionist; helping to assess how well shelter animals got along with cats before going home with a new family; and helping to interview potential new staff members and volunteers: [...] "demanding to be let into the office and hopping up on the lap of the candidate as if to say ‘You’re all dressed up, let’s see how you really feel about cats.’ He was an excellent judge of character." [...] Norman was especially appreciated for being [...] "that purring presence when we really needed him. Whether he snuggled up <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>lap</b> or curled up on a bed on your desk, he was a great comfort to us all." [...] Norman lived until January 2014, believed to be 19 years of age.|$|E
