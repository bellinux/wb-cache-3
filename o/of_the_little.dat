40|$|<b>The</b> <b>littlest</b> Higgs {{model is}} the most {{economical}} one among various little Higgs models. In <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>littlest</b> Higgs model, we study the process e + e − → e + e − H at the ILC and calculate <b>the</b> correction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>littlest</b> Higgs model to <b>the</b> cross section <b>of</b> this process. <b>The</b> results show that, in the favorable parameter spaces preferred by the electroweak precision data, <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relative correction is {{in the range from}} a few percent to tens percent. In most case, the correction is large enough to reach <b>the</b> measurement precision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ILC. Therefore, <b>the</b> correction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>littlest</b> Higgs model to the process e + e − → e + e − H might be detected at the ILC which will give an ideal way to test the model.

Beginning in 1950 and {{continuing}} through the early 1980s, however, many of the major glaciers advanced in response to relatively cooler temperatures of the mid-century. The Carbon, Cowlitz, Emmons, and Nisqually Glaciers advanced during the late 1970s and early 1980s {{as a result of}} high snowfalls during the 1960s and 1970s. Since the early-1980s, however, many glaciers have been thinning and retreating and some advances have slowed.|$|E
