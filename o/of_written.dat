What kind <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> are presented to the students and what potentially miss due to the selection? Is any form <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> presented more thoroughly or as {{more important than any}} other in the curriculum? The professor of linguistics, Roz Ivanic, has formed different discourses <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> that she has found being used in education <b>of</b> <b>writing.</b> With these discourses of writing  I have applied them on the curriculum and then been able to see wich forms <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> that are premiered. By using close reading as a method of analyze I have been able to interpret the curriculum. I have connected close reading as a method with the hermeneutic analysis tradition. The discourses <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> is my tool and my theory wich holds different forms <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> that are connected to earlier science <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> that I present as a background in the monograph. The conclusion I have reached are that the curriculum holds four discourses <b>of</b> <b>writing.</b> That means that the form <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> that are presented to the students are a writing to imitate other types of texts, a grammatical correct spelling, a thotoughly processed text and knowledge about their own mental process that is activated during <b>writing.</b> The diskourse <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> that is presented as the most important in the curriculum is the skills discourse <b>of</b> <b>writing.</b> That leads to a form <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> in grammatically correct writing and prepares the students to adjust to a writing that is presented mainly in higher forms of education...|$|R

5|$|On {{the eve of}} the Allies' {{occupation}} of Japan, special-service officers of the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyed virtually all records, drawings, and photographs of or relating to the Yamato-class battleships, leaving only fragmentary records of the design characteristics and other technical matters. The destruction of these documents was so efficient that until 1948 the only known images of Yamato and Musashi were those taken by United States Navy aircraft involved in the attacks on the two battleships. Although some additional photographs and information, from documents that were not destroyed, have come to light over the years, the loss of the majority <b>of</b> <b>written</b> records for the class has made extensive research into the Yamato class somewhat difficult.

40|$|In {{the writing}} {{teaching}} and learning, good students should involve process <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> {{in order to}} produce an effective writing. This statement is supported by Oshima (2006 : 3) that writing is as a process rather than a product. The process <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> includes prewriting, drafting, revising, editing and publishing. The process <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> is used to organize what the students think, plan and help them in writing a composition, especially an essay. It means that the ideas organized can be done through steps or procedures in the process <b>of</b> <b>writing.</b> However, the problem appears when students take an essay writing test. From the writer’s point of view, this process seems inapplicable in the test. Therefore, it is necessary for the writer to get further information on the factors related to the process <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> in the essay writing test.

40|$|This {{article is}} closed access. The quality <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> {{construction}} specifications {{is one of}} the greatest challenges facing construction contractors or their representatives in today’s business environment. Writers of construction specifications have been criticized for their contribution toward construction disputes.

Equally, a <b>written</b> exposition <b>of</b> a quantitative instrument that measures the quality <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> construction specifications is not available in the literature. Thus the construction industry needs to develop methodologies for measuring the quality <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> construction specifications that should overcome their current underperformance in this area.

40|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> to {{represent}} the heritage language represents a contentious issue for many members of Puebloan societies in the American Southwest. Many community members resist the use <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> for this purpose {{on the grounds that}} it acts as a form of colonialism, while others accept the use <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> in the heritage language because it is seen as valorizing the heritage language itself. This study seeks to address three research questions: 1) What factors motivate either a resistance to or acceptance of the use <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> {{to represent}} a heritage language? 2) If the use <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> is accepted or even promoted, what factors motivate the decision to use one writing system (e. g., alphabet, syllabary) over another? and 3) What factors motivate the decision to employ certain sound-symbol correspondences within that system? Ultimately, the factors that motivate a general resistance to the use <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> will be shown to involve the view <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> as a centrifugal, or disunifying, force, whereas the factors that motivate a general acceptance of the use <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> will be shown to involve the view <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> as a centripetal, or unifying, force. Further, by using language ideologies (i. e., syncretism, variationism, utilitarianism) as a heuristic, the decisions made regarding the development of the Than Ówîngeh orthography will be shown to support the principles of learnability, transparency, and acceptability.
