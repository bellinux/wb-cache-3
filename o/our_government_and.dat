2500|$|Regarding the 2006 {{war between}} Israel and Hezbollah, Short stated that [...] "Israel {{is out of}} control and <b>our</b> <b>Government</b> <b>and</b> the US is giving them a green light to continue" [...] and that [...] "Britain clearly now just backs President (George W.) Bush in {{whatever}} he does, in automatically backing Israel in breaching international law, in disproportionate attacks on Lebanon and attacks on Gaza".|$|E
2500|$|Baldwin {{had already}} begun {{promoting}} militia movements on his radio show as early as 1995. He says that in his opinion, people like Morris Dees, head of the Southern Poverty Law Center, try to [...] "pander the market of fear, trying to convince everybody that anyone with a gun, any person who wants to own a gun, and anyone who would consider themselves part of a citizen militia {{is a threat to}} <b>our</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> to our society." ...|$|E
2500|$|How could a {{candidate}} for president credibly signal to the American public that his or her exclusive focus would be to remove this fundamental corruption from our government? ... Here’s one path: Imagine {{a candidate}}—a credible nonpolitician... The candidate makes a single two-part pledge: if elected, she will (1) hold the government hostage until Congress enacts a program to remove the fundamental corruption that is <b>our</b> <b>government,</b> <b>and</b> (2) once that program is enacted, she will resign.|$|E

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to avoid politics. The news headlines which interrupt our favourite television programs and the news banners which scroll across the most popular websites are filled with stories of wars, <b>government</b> failures <b>and</b> corruption.

Given such views, few were surprised when a recent opinion poll found that only 9...|$|R
50|$|That {{loyalty to}} the {{constituted}} authority of our nations and their subdivisions is a cardinal virtue of our brotherhood, the pledged faith of which shall never be broken; and that our brotherhood, receiving the blessings of liberty, education, and fraternity, shall ever support, foster and defend our universities, colleges, and school systems, founded under the dispensation of <b>our</b> <b>governments</b> <b>and</b> constituting the bulwarks of democracy for us, for our posterity and for all men.|$|R
2500|$|Later Boris Almazov made an {{important}} observation in a commemorative speech: [...] "Most of our writers who describe {{the lives of}} Russian state officials and people from governmental spheres have only fleeting experiences of this kind... More often than not they've served only formally, hardly noticing the faces of their chiefs, let alone those of their colleagues. Pisemsky treated working for the State differently. He gave himself to serving the Russian state wholeheartedly and, whatever post he occupied, had one single objective in mind: fighting the dark forces which <b>our</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> {{the best part of}} our society try to fight..." [...] This, according to the speaker, enabled the author not only to fathom the depths of Russian life but to delve down [...] "to the very core of the Russian soul." ...|$|E
2500|$|Panopticon was an overtly {{political}} release, {{and arguably}} the clearest statement made within their music yet. It displayed fears of surveillance and of tacit governmental influence; its namesake, the panopticon, was Jeremy Bentham's concept for a prison {{system in which}} all the prisoners can be viewed by one guard in a central tower, without being able to know whether they are being observed or not. Bentham described the Panopticon as [...] "a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto without example." [...] Quizzed on government conspiracies, Turner states: [...] "I do believe that each and every day <b>our</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> the huge corporate entities of this country lie to us about numerous subjects. In this respect we are all victims of a huge conspiracy—most of those in power are only concerned with the advancement of their agendas and have no qualms about deceiving and hurting the American people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harlan {{was also}} the most stridently anti-imperialist justice on the Supreme Court, arguing {{consistently}} in the Insular Cases (from 1901 to 1905) that the Constitution did not permit the demarcation of different rights between citizens of {{the states and the}} residents of newly acquired territories in the Philippines, Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico, a view that was consistently in the minority. In Hawaii v. Mankichi (1903) his opinion stated: [...] "If the principles now announced should become firmly established, the time may not be far distant when, under the exactions of trade and commerce, and to gratify an ambition to become the dominant power in all the earth, the United States will acquire territories in every direction... whose inhabitants will be regarded as 'subjects' or 'dependent peoples,' to be controlled as Congress may see fit... which will engraft on our republican institutions a colonial system entirely foreign to the genius of <b>our</b> <b>Government</b> <b>and</b> abhorrent to the principles that underlie and pervade our Constitution." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the {{twilight}} of his life, Beveridge came to repudiate some of the earlier expansion of governmental power that he had championed in his earlier career. In one notable address, delivered before the Sons of the Revolution's annual dinner in June 1923, Beveridge decried {{the growth of the}} regulatory state and the proliferation of regulatory bodies, bureaus and commissions. [...] "America would be better off as a country and Americans happier and more prosperous as a people," [...] he suggested, [...] "if half of <b>our</b> <b>Government</b> boards, bureaus <b>and</b> commissions were abolished, hundreds of thousands of <b>our</b> <b>Government</b> officials, agents <b>and</b> employees were discharged <b>and</b> two-thirds of <b>our</b> <b>Government</b> regulations, restrictions <b>and</b> inhibitions were removed." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Wildlife Enforcement Monitoring System {{will provide}} the {{platform}} for our enforcement agencies to collect and share information on the trends and patterns of wildlife crime. Moreover, the cross-border nature of wild life crime underscores the need to enhance cooperation among <b>our</b> <b>governments</b> <b>and</b> to pool financial and human resources. I am confident that these measures {{will go a long}} way in enhancing our capacity to protect our wildlife resources. Mwai Kibaki, President- Republic of Kenya ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{moved from}} Homs {{where he did}} High School, to Damascus in 1969 to study Mechanical Engineering at Damascus University. He {{graduated}} in 1974 as a mechanical engineer. He wrote about the cultural experience of those years, post 6 Day War in 1967, for a Goethe Institute publication, where he considered it a crucial disillusionment: [...] "We were totally convinced that winning the war would be easy for us, due to the propaganda <b>our</b> <b>governments</b> <b>and</b> political leaders had made".|$|R
2500|$|The President must [...] "take {{care that}} the laws be {{faithfully}} executed." [...] This clause in the Constitution imposes a duty on the President to enforce {{the laws of the}} United States and is called the Take Care Clause, also known as the Faithful Execution Clause or Faithfully Executed Clause. This clause is meant to ensure that a law is faithfully executed by the President [...] even if he disagrees with the purpose of that law. Addressing the North Carolina ratifying convention, William Maclaine declared that the Faithful Execution Clause was [...] "one of the [...] best provisions." [...] If the President [...] "takes care to see the laws faithfully executed, it will be more than is done in any government on the continent; for I will venture to say that <b>our</b> <b>government,</b> <b>and</b> those of the other states, are, with respect to the execution of the laws, in many respects mere ciphers." [...] President George Washington interpreted this clause as imposing on him a unique duty to ensure the execution of federal law. Discussing a tax rebellion, Washington observed, [...] "it is my duty to see the Laws executed: to permit them to be trampled upon with impunity would be repugnant to [...] " ...|$|E

The RToP was brilliant, informative and decisive, reminding us that all <b>our</b> <b>Governments,</b> <b>and</b> we the people, have a moral and legal responsibility to act to protect Human Rights and International Law and we cannot be silent when injustice is being done to anyone, anywhere." ...|$|R
