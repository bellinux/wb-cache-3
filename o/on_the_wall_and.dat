5|$|As {{the press}} conference had been {{broadcast}} live, within hours, thousands of people gathered at the Berlin Wall demanding that the guards open the gates. The border guards were unable to contact their superiors for instructions and, fearing a stampede, opened the gates. The iconic scenes that followed– people pouring into West Berlin, standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>and</b> attacking it with pickaxes– were broadcast worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Mulder, still {{restrained}} {{in his bed}} at the hospital, {{sees the}} silhouette of the monster at the window. He screams for the nurse, but she has already been bitten and opens the window to let the monster in. Scully tries to visit Mulder but the nurse refuses access. Suddenly Scully sees the nurse as a corpse, realizes that Mulder is in danger, and runs into Mulder's room. There she sees the monster <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> shoots at it. It leaps through the partially open window, breaking the glass and wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Smith's death, a fan {{memorial}} {{was initiated}} outside Solutions Audio (4334 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California), the site {{at which the}} cover of the Figure 8 album was shot. Farewell messages to Smith were written <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> flowers, photos, candles, and empty bottles of alcohol mentioned in Smith's songs were left. Since then, the wall has been a regular target for graffiti but is regularly restored by fans.|$|E

5|$|The largest Maya sculptures {{consisted}} of architectural façades crafted from stucco. The rough form {{was laid out}} on a plain plaster base coating <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> the three-dimensional form was built up using small stones. Finally, this was coated with stucco and moulded into the finished form; human body forms were first modelled in stucco, with their costumes added afterwards. The final stucco sculpture was then brightly painted. Giant stucco masks were used to adorn temple façades by the Late Preclassic, and such decoration continued into the Classic period.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a shot {{of a little girl}} {{sleeping}} in her bed. As the music starts, rays of light emanate from the bedside radio with cartoon violins playing the music. The sun rises inside a picture <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> the girl wakes and starts playing with her doll. A fairy goes around tapping all her toys on the floor and a large, golden teapot comes alive and shoots a rainbow from its spout. A cartoon version of the girl then slides along the rainbow and, interpreting the lyrics of the song, catches a falling star and rides over the moon.|$|E
5|$|In A Dance with Dragons (2011), after sending Sam {{away to the}} Citadel {{to become}} a Maester, Jon {{successfully}} negotiates the peaceful surrender of the remains of Mance's army. He promises to settle the wildlings in sparsely populated regions of the North, and allows {{some of them to}} join the Watch to garrison the many abandoned Night's Watch fortresses. Many members of the Watch dislike the idea of allowing their ancient enemies through the Wall and welcoming them into their ranks. Jon attempts to juggle the integration of the wildlings, growing unrest within the Night's Watch, and Stannis' attempts to use the Watch in his war for the Iron Throne, while trying to maintain the Watch's strict political neutrality. Already agitated by these unprecedented developments, a group of officers led by Slynt openly defies Jon's orders. When Slynt refuses to submit, Jon executes the man himself. Stannis explains to Jon his plan to attack the Dreadfort, but Jon advises him to instead rally the Mountain Clans and attack Deepwood Motte, the fortress of House Glover recently captured by the Ironborn. Stannis does so, winning the support of the Glovers and the Mormonts. Jon learns that his sister Arya is being married to Ramsay Bolton so that the Boltons may claim Winterfell. Unaware that the bride is actually Jeyne Poole, Jon sends Mance to rescue her while Stannis marches on Winterfell. Jon later receives a letter from Ramsay claiming that Stannis has been defeated and Mance is a prisoner. Ramsay demands hostages, else he will march <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>and</b> kill Jon. Jon decides to seek out and kill Ramsay himself, but he is stabbed by his Night's Watch brothers seeking to uphold the Watch's neutrality before he can leave Castle Black.|$|E

25|$|A {{wide range}} of other devotional {{practices}} can be found among Catholics. An example {{is the use of}} a Home Altar. This practice dates back to the early Christians who used to pray in their homes even before churches were built for public worship. In a Home Altar, a cross usually hangs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> images of Jesus, the Blessed Virgin and saints may be displayed, along with a copy of the Bible or other devotional literature.|$|E
25|$|But {{discrimination}} {{was perhaps}} less overt than such events suggest. It {{could be argued}} that some politicians and publicists may have promoted and disseminated controversial ideologies through popular books such as H. Glynn-Ward’s 1921 The Writing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>and</b> Tom MacInnes’s 1929 The Oriental Occupation of British Columbia. Newspapermen such as L. D. Taylor of the Vancouver World and General Victor Odlum of the Star generated a glut of editorials analyzing and warning about the “Oriental Menace,” as did Danger: The Anti-Asiatic Weekly.|$|E
25|$|The {{subjects}} {{believed that}} for each wrong answer, the learner was receiving actual shocks. In reality, {{there were no}} shocks. After the confederate was separated from the subject, the confederate set up a tape recorder integrated with the electroshock generator, which played prerecorded sounds for each shock level. After a number of voltage-level increases, the actor started to bang on the wall that separated him from the subject. After several times banging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> complaining about his heart condition, all responses by the learner would cease.|$|E

25|$|The {{painting}} in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, called A Visit to the Nursery, dated 1661, may depict the family Hinlopen. According to Walter Liedtke there is some general resemblance. The scene is set in an imaginary room. The chimney resembles {{the one in the}} former Amsterdam townhall, also painted by Pieter de Hooch. A guest is greeted by the new mother and her hat-doffing husband. There is a seascape, a painting of a brawny fisherman <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> Persian carpets on the table and the floor. The dog in the painting could be a Bolognese.|$|E
25|$|Neutral monists {{adhere to}} the {{position}} that perceived {{things in the world}} can be regarded as either physical or mental depending on whether one is interested in their relationship to other things in the world or their relationship to the perceiver. For example, a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> the pigment of which it is made, but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system. Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects.|$|E
25|$|Banda was {{the subject}} of an {{extensive}} cult of personality. Every business building was required to have an official picture of him hanging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> no poster, clock or picture could be higher than his portrait. Before every film, a video of Banda waving to the people was shown while the anthem played. When Banda visited a city, a contingent of women were expected to greet him at the airport and dance for him. A special cloth, bearing the president's picture, was the required attire for these performances. Houses of worship required government approval to operate, and some faiths such as Jehovah's Witnesses were banned entirely.|$|E

25|$|The austere {{portrait}} in his normally constrained palette is another Whistler exercise in tonal harmony and composition. The deceptively simple design {{is in fact}} a balancing act of differing shapes, particularly the rectangles of curtain, picture <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> floor which stabilize the curve of her face, dress, and chair. Again, although his mother is the subject, Whistler commented that the narrative was of little importance. In reality, however, it was an homage to his pious mother. After the initial shock of her moving in with her son, she aided him considerably by stabilizing his behavior somewhat, tending to his domestic needs, and providing an aura of conservative respectability that helped win over patrons.|$|E
25|$|Chelsea {{were unable}} to build on their title success, and {{finished}} a disappointing 16th the following season. The team was aging and there followed a succession of uninspiring mid-table finishes; one bright spot in this period was {{the emergence of the}} prolific goalscorer Jimmy Greaves, who scored 122 league goals in four seasons. Along with Greaves, a series of other promising youngsters, informally known as Drake's Ducklings, emerged in the first team, though their inexperience ensured that performances remained erratic. One of the lowest points for the club in this period was being knocked out of the FA Cup in the 3rd round by Fourth Division side, Crewe Alexandra, in January 1961. When Greaves was sold to Milan in June 1961 the writing was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and,</b> without his goals, results slumped. Drake was sacked in September after a 4–0 loss to Blackpool with Chelsea bottom of the league table. He was replaced by 33-year-old player-coach Tommy Docherty.|$|E
25|$|The site {{on which}} the Flatiron Building would stand was bought in 1857 by Amos Eno, who shortly built the Fifth Avenue Hotel on a site diagonally across from it. Eno tore down the four-story St. Germaine Hotel on {{the south end of}} the lot, and {{replaced}} it with a seven-story apartment building, the Cumberland. On the remainder of the lot he built four three-story buildings for commercial use. This left four stories of the Cumberland's northern face exposed, which Eno rented out to advertisers, including The New York Times, who installed a sign made up of electric lights. Eno later put a canvas screen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> projected images onto it from a magic lantern on top of one of his smaller buildings, presenting advertisements and interesting pictures alternately. Both the Times and the New York Tribune began using the screen for news bulletins, and on election nights tens of thousands of people would gather in Madison Square, waiting for the latest results.|$|E
