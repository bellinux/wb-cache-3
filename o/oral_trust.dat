Among non-equals, a servant {{has to prove}} his trustworthiness but not yet vice versa. The script 信 (xin) tells of living up to one’s words. Yanxing 言行 (speech and action) describes actively keeping a verbal promise. The Agrarian school endorses xin as the primary virtue in its utopia of virtual equals. It knew <b>oral</b> <b>trust</b> and {{had no use for}} written covenants. In debating Mencius, Gaozi kept to that earlier primacy granted public speech as tied to one’s social reputation. Mencius turned inward and elevated mind as the inner good of moral intent instead. In the Doctrine of the Mean, inner xin would expand outward into becoming the ultimate truth, the sincerity of Heaven and Earth. The essay ends on an aside on the case of the Cretan Liar...|$|E
5000|$|Nearly all trusts {{created by}} {{individuals}} {{are the subject}} of some type of writing (either a trust agreement or a will), which provides evidence of not only the intent to create the trust, but the intended operative terms of it. However, abiding by the old common law rules, the Uniform Trust Code does recognize that a trust can be created orally. [...] However, to prove the terms of such a trust can only be established by [...] "clear and convincing evidence." [...] Such <b>oral</b> <b>trusts</b> are extremely rare in modern practice.|$|R

50|$|Article 3 {{provides}} that the Convention only applies to express trusts created voluntarily and evidenced in writing. It will therefore not cover <b>oral</b> <b>trusts,</b> resulting trusts, constructive trusts, statutory trusts or trusts created by judicial order. But signatory states {{are free to}} apply the Convention to any form of trust and the Recognition of Trusts Act 1987 has applied the provisions to all trusts arising under English law, no matter when or how they were created, albeit only applying the provisions to transactions affecting those trusts made after 1 August 1987. There are incidental question problems if the trust is testamentary and, under Article 4, if it is alleged that the testator lacked capacity, or that the will is formally or substantively invalid, or {{that it had been}} revoked, these issues must be determined first under the lex fori Conflict rules on characterisation and choice of law before the Convention rules can apply. This will include, for example, a detailed consideration of any marriage settlement or applicable law containing community property provisions which might prevent the testator alienating property from a spouse or child of the family (see succession (conflict)). Obviously, if the will purporting to create the trust is held invalid, there are no trusts to adjudicate upon.|$|R

Para isto nos amparamos em conceitos histÃricos de MemÃria e HistÃria Oral, acreditando na importÃncia da MemÃria de idosos para a construÃÃo do conhecimento histÃrico. Seguimos uma investigaÃÃo de cunho qualitativo, onde a partir de entrevistas selecionamos quatro histÃrias de vida, de participantes do citado grupo, para que, atravÃs de suas histÃrias, pudÃssemos entender suas trajetÃrias de vida, e investigar o porquÃ de hoje se encontrarem reunidos em grupos de socializaÃÃo, que buscam uma melhoria na qualidade de vida de idosos/pobres. Aqui os idosos aparecem com nomes fictÃcios, tendo suas caracterÃsticas prÃprias e semelhantes aos demais. Foram eles Seu Odair, homem que admira suas amizades e Ã muito popular no grupo; Dona AntÃnia, ainda muito apaixonada pelo marido; Dona Ãngela, que sente muito a morte da mÃe; e Seu Fausto, homem que nÃo esquece seus sofrimentos desde a sua infÃncia. Constatamos em suas memÃrias, que suas vidas haviam sido marcadas pelo sofrimento e por pouco acesso a instituiÃÃes de ensinos. Foram trabalhadores desde a infÃncia e hoje sÃo analfabetos, ou sabem ler muito pouco. Receberam a formaÃÃo para o trabalho atravÃs de relaÃÃes sociais como a familiar, e, ou, dentro dos prÃprios espaÃos onde trabalharam. Hoje estes idosos recebem benefÃcios e aposentadorias do Governo, o que lhes propiciam um sentimento de alegria, pois para a maioria Ã a Ãnica fase de suas vidas onde uma renda mensal fixa veio a fazer parte de suas realidades. Por fim, acreditam que participarem ativamente em reuniÃes de grupos de idosos, Ã um dos fatos que lhes trouxeram uma real melhoria na qualidade de vida. ABSTRACT Analysing the Educational and Social Memory {{of participants}} from the: Grupo de Idosos SÃo JosÃ do SeminÃrio Crato-CE {{is the main}} objective of this paper. For this we used historical concepts of Memory and <b>Oral</b> History, <b>trusting</b> {{in the importance of}} the Elderlyâs Memory for the construction of the historical knowledge. We performed a qualitative research and through interviews we selected four life histories of participants from the mentioned group, in order that, through their histories, we could understand their lives and investigate why nowadays they are reunited in socializing groups which seek improvements in the life quality of elders/poor. The elderly appear with fictitious names, having their own characteristics and similar to the others. They were Odair, a man who admires his friendships and is very popular in the group; Antonia, who is still in love with her husband; Ãngela, who mourns her motherâs death; and Fausto, a man who has not forgotten his suffering since his childhood. We noticed in their memories that they had suffered a lot and they had not had much access education institutions. They had been workers since their childhood and nowadays they are illiterate or know how to read just a little. They had received their training for working through social relations such as familiar and/or inside their own spaces where they worked. Nowadays these elders receive benefits or retirement grants from the Government which offer them a feeling of joy, because for the majority, this is the only phase of their lives which a monthly fixed incoming becomes part of their realities. Finally, they believe that frequently participating in meetings of elderly groups is one of the facts that brought them a real improvement in their life quality...|$|R
