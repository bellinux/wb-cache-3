5|$|While no {{official}} knot exists for tying the two {{ends of the}} thong together, the decorative diamond knot {{has become the most}} common. When produced, the thong is joined by a simple <b>overhand</b> <b>knot</b> and various region specific traditions have arisen around tying the diamond knot, including: having a fellow course member tie it; having a mentor or course leader tie it; and having the recipient tie it after completing some additional activity that shows he or she has mastered the skills taught to him or her during training.|$|E
2500|$|Square knots are {{rectangular}} cloth patches {{that use}} a multi-colored knot and/or border design to informally represent certain awards. Some emblems use other designs, {{such as the}} <b>overhand</b> <b>knot</b> for the District Award of Merit, but they are all referred to as [...] "square knots". Some awards are represented by both medals or badges and square knots; others certificates or plaques and square knots; while other awards or recognitions have a certificate and a small device to wear atop a square knot emblem. Only a few square knots may be worn by youth, among them the Hornaday conservation award, the religious emblem or life-saving awards.|$|E
50|$|An arbor knot is tied {{by first}} passing the line around the reel arbor. The tag end is then tied in an <b>overhand</b> <b>knot</b> around the running line. Finally, an <b>overhand</b> <b>knot</b> is tied in the tag end. When tightened, the <b>overhand</b> <b>knot</b> in the tag end jams against the <b>overhand</b> <b>knot</b> tied around the running line.|$|E
50|$|Ashley's bend is a knot used to {{securely}} {{join the}} ends of two ropes together. It is similar to several related bend knots which consist of two interlocking <b>overhand</b> <b>knots,</b> {{and in particular the}} alpine butterfly bend. These related bends differ by the way the two constituent <b>overhand</b> <b>knots</b> are interlocked.|$|R

5000|$|The double <b>overhand</b> <b>knot</b> {{is simply}} a logical {{extension}} of the regular <b>overhand</b> <b>knot,</b> made with one additional pass. The result is slightly larger {{and more difficult to}} untie. It forms {{the first part of the}} surgeon's knot and both sides of a double fisherman's knot. The strangle knot is a rearranged double <b>overhand</b> <b>knot</b> made around an object. It is sometimes used to secure items to posts. According to The Ashley Book of Knots, [...] "A double <b>overhand</b> <b>knot</b> tied in a cat-o'-nine-tails is termed a blood knot." [...] See: blood knot.|$|E

50|$|The <b>overhand</b> <b>knot</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fundamental}} knots, and it forms the basis of many others, including the simple noose, overhand loop, angler's loop, reef knot, fisherman's knot, and water knot. The <b>overhand</b> <b>knot</b> is a stopper, especially when used alone, and hence it is very secure, to the point of jamming badly. It should be used if the knot is intended to be permanent. It is often used to prevent the end of a rope from unraveling. An <b>overhand</b> <b>knot</b> becomes a trefoil knot, a true knot in the mathematical sense, by joining the ends.|$|E
50|$|In {{practical}} terms, these knots {{are generally}} shown as {{consisting of two}} interlocked <b>overhand</b> <b>knots</b> made in two parallel ropes or cords. The variations are differentiated by {{the way in which}} the <b>overhand</b> <b>knots</b> interweave and in the final arrangement of the knot.To show if a young couple's love would last, each would take a small limb of a tree and tie a lovers knot. If the knot held and grew for approximately a year, their love would stay true.|$|R

50|$|Hunter's bend (or rigger's bend) is a knot used to join two lines. It {{consists}} of interlocking <b>overhand</b> <b>knots,</b> and can jam under moderate strain. It is topologically {{similar to the}} Zeppelin bend.|$|R
50|$|The fisherman's knot is a bend (a knot {{for joining}} two lines) with a {{symmetrical}} structure {{consisting of two}} <b>overhand</b> <b>knots,</b> each tied around the standing part of the other. Other names for the fisherman's knot include: angler's knot, English knot, halibut knot, waterman's knot.|$|R
40|$|We combine {{experiments}} and theory {{to study the}} mechanics of <b>overhand</b> <b>knots</b> in slender elastic rods under tension. The equilibrium shape of the knot is governed by an interplay between topology, friction, and bending. We use precision model experiments to quantify the dependence of the mechanical response of the knot {{as a function of}} the geometry of the self-contacting region, and for different topologies as measured by their crossing number. An analytical model based on the nonlinear theory of thin elastic rods is then developed to describe how the physical and topological parameters of the knot set the tensile force required for equilibrium. Excellent agreement is found between theory and experiments for <b>overhand</b> <b>knots</b> over a wide range of crossing numbers. National Science Foundation (U. S.) (CMMI- 1129894...|$|R

50|$|The {{strangle}} knot is {{a simple}} binding knot. Similar to the constrictor knot, it also features an <b>overhand</b> <b>knot</b> under a riding turn. A visible {{difference is that the}} ends emerge at the outside edges, rather than between the turns as for a constrictor. This knot is a rearranged double <b>overhand</b> <b>knot</b> and makes up each half of the double fisherman's knot.|$|E
5000|$|A honda knot is {{the loop}} knot {{commonly}} used in a lasso. [...] Its round shape, especially when tied in stiff rope, helps it slide freely along the rope it is tied around.

50|$|On knotted rope halters, {{the knot}} often is used under the jaw {{both as a}} {{decorative}} knot, and also to fashion the lower loop onto which a lead rope is attached.

50|$|The {{dough is}} rolled and then pulled into small, tight <b>overhand</b> <b>knots,</b> and pre-baked in a pizza oven (authentically, at {{temperatures}} of 700°F or higher).

Before serving, garlic knots are baked a second time, and may be accompanied with marinara sauce.|$|R
50|$|The figure-eight knot or figure-of-eight knot {{is a type}} of stopper knot. It is very {{important}} in both sailing and rock climbing as a method of stopping ropes from running out of retaining devices. Like the <b>overhand</b> <b>knot,</b> which will jam under strain, often requiring the rope to be cut, the figure-of-eight will also jam, but is usually more easily undone than the <b>overhand</b> <b>knot.</b>|$|E

[...] Jewelry is often made in combination of both the knots and various beads (glass, wooden, and so on), pendants or shells. Sometimes 'found' focal points are used for necklaces, such as rings or gemstones, either wire-wrapped to allow for securing or captured in a net-like array of intertwining <b>overhand</b> <b>knots.</b> A knotting board {{is often used to}} mount the cords for macramé work.
