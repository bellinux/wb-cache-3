Although given a tight time frame of only three months, the new school was created on the location of Horwang School, and gradually absorbed the older school, the entire staff merging within a few years. ML Pin became the first director of the school, the country's first coeducational school, now known as Triam Udom Suksa School. It {{is widely regarded as}} one of the best schools in the country. During his term as director, which lasted until 1944, he developed and implemented a fixed class schedule system, along with a mechanical timetable used to assign teaching periods, which is still in use today.|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} four {{forms of the}} {{philosophical}} consciousness <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> {{which can lead to}} a break-through of Hegel' s logical ontology at the metalogicallevel. The views of K. Jaspers, S. L. Frank, P T. Raju and D. T. Suzuki are considered in succession. These four modern philosophers conform to the following methodological conditions: a. they <b>are</b> representative <b>of</b> prevailing forms of the consciousness <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in the traditions of Western, Russian. Indian and Chinese philosophy; b. they have given expression to the metalogical factor in the consciousness <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> and c. they can be confronted basically. with Hegel's logical ontology. Their views are. structurally characterized by the author and submitted to critical comparison. It is then demonstrated that the Indian philosopher Aurobindo Ghose has assimilated these forms of the consciousness <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in his personal experience <b>of</b> <b>Being.</b> Finally, the author shows how the Western logical Notion <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> is overcome by the metalogical experience <b>of</b> <b>Being.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Heidegger {{argued that}} modern {{human beings have}} {{forgotten}} a more fundamental and originary understanding of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>Being.</b> This forgetting <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> {{is not limited to}} lived experience but permeates the history of philosophy and metaphysics. Put simply, modern philosophy (and, for Heidegger, metaphysics) presupposes a reductive understanding <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> as an entity, or an entity with enduring presence, that ultimately limits the possibilities of human thinking and existence. Educational practice and scholarship also operates from this comportment of a forgetting <b>of</b> <b>Being.</b> The following inquiry raises the question <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in teaching by phenomenologically engaging with three key distinctions from Heidegger’s thinking as each bears upon educational practice. World and attunement, the first two distinctions, are most accessible in Heidegger’s thinking from his magnum opus Being and Time. The third distinction represents a theme from Heidegger’s later thinking on technology, the danger of Enframing. While not exhaustive, each concept interrogates the many-sided question <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in order to illuminate new possibilities for teaching. The inquiry does not offer solutions but rather traces a path that opens and keeps in tension the question <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in teaching in order to support further study...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of {{relation}} between the question <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> {{and the question of}} art in the thought of Martin Heidegger. His thought trajectory comprises two different forms <b>of</b> question considering <b>Being.</b> He calls the first one the main question. This form he considers to be metaphysical since it can be traced in traditional philosophical thought back to Plato and Nietzsche, or the thought of the first beginning. The second form is the fundamental question about Being which leads to overcoming of metaphysical understanding <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> and belongs to the thought of the second beginning. This second form, according to his words at the seminar at Le Thor appears in three forms along his thought trajectory; firstly, as a fundamental ontological question of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>Being,</b> then, as significant historical question concerning the truth <b>of</b> <b>Being,</b> and finally, as a topological question concerning the space and spatiality <b>of</b> <b>Being.</b> His position concerning art needs to be considered in the light of fundamental issue <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in his thought...|$|R
