40|$|This report {{provides}} {{estimates of}} generic {{costs for the}} management, disposal, and surveillance of various waste types, {{from the time they}} are generated to the end of their institutional control. Costs include monitoring and surveillance costs required after waste disposal. Available data on costs for the treatment, storage, disposal, and transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive, low-level radioactive, transuranic radioactive, hazardous, mixed (low-level radioactive plus hazardous), and sanitary wastes are presented. The costs cover all major elements that contribute to the total system life-cycle (i. e., ``cradle to grave``) cost for each waste type. This total cost is the sum of fixed and variable cost components. Variable costs are affected by <b>operating</b> <b>rates</b> and throughput capacities and vary in direct proportion to changes in the level of activity. Fixed costs remain constant regardless of changes in the amount of waste, <b>operating</b> <b>rates,</b> or throughput capacities. Key factors that influence cost, such as the size and throughput capacity of facilities, are identified. In many cases, ranges of values for the key variables are presented.

40|$|Abstract—The {{processes}} and routes of syngas production from biomass gasification were first outlined, {{and the key}} processes of this technology were highlighted in the paper. Simultaneously, the cost of syngas production from biomass gasification was evaluated to be RMB 1. 05 /Nm 3 when the handling capacity of gasifier, material cost and system <b>operating</b> <b>rate</b> is separately fixed to be 1 ton/h, RMB 250 /ton and 0. 8.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the problem of characterizing production structures when there is input fixity but fixed inputs can be utilized with varying intensities. Unless the rate of utilization of quasi-fixed factors is adequately measured, primal or dual characterizations of producer behavior common in the empirical literature may not be valid. The problem is overcome by specifying another input, the <b>operating</b> <b>rate,</b> which firms can use the short run to adjust to unexpected market changes when there is quasi-fixity in production. The model {{is applied to the}} Canadian pulp and paper and sawmilling industries. The results do not permit rejection of the hypotheses of quasi-fixity and varying utilization of quasi-fixed factors in the short run. A model of instantaneous adjustment of factor inputs is clearly outperformed by the quasi-fixity model incorporating an <b>operating</b> <b>rate</b> decision. Production Economics,...|$|E

The <b>operating</b> <b>rate</b> decision also reveals most clearly the important consequences of quasi-fixity, and shows how our model contrasts with more conventional treatments. Other models of temporary equilibrium of production usually assume either the strict applicability of the underlying production function (requiring the assumption of either completely flexible product prices {{or at least one}} fully variable factor if quantity rationing is not to take place) or that current output is determined by aggregate demand without reference to the production function constraint. The assumed long-run production structure is two-level CES, with the inner function's vintage bundle of capital and energy combining with efficiency units of labour in the outer function. Long-run average cost minimization assumptions are used to derive the parameters of the production function, assuming constant returns to scale and constant growth of labour efficiency. These assumptions about the functional form and properties of the long-run production function are tested against various alternatives {{in the context of the}} derived temporary equilibrium output decision. ...|$|E
