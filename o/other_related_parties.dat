I consider the ownership of the firm as the ownership of the rights to terminate cooperation with any party while maintaining a contractual or employment relation with all the <b>other</b> <b>related</b> <b>parties</b> of the firm. The model in this paper allows for the separation of the ownership of the firm from the ownership of the alienable assets that partly constitute it.

40|$|Recent {{corporate}} scandals have raised considerable concern among regulators and stock market participants about <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions (RPTs), prompting Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) to prohibit personal loans to executives and non-executive board members. In a large {{representative sample of}} companies for a period that predates SOX, we find RPTs are wide spread and involve equally executive and non-executives board members; additionally, the proportion of <b>related</b> <b>party</b> loans is smaller than <b>other</b> non-loan <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions such as purchases or direct services. When we {{examine the relationship between}} RPTs and the extant literature's corporate governance mechanisms (such as board characteristics, CEO pay-performance sensitivity, and outside monitors), we generally find weaker corporate governance mechanisms associated with more RPTs. We also find that industry-adjusted returns are negatively associated with RPTs. On further examination of loans versus other types of RPTs not considered in SOX, we find a negative relationship between industry-adjusted returns and loans to executives and nonexecutive directors, and a similar relationship for other types of RPTs with non-executive directors. In summary, our results show strong support for RPTs as conflicts of interest between managers/board members and their shareholders. ...|$|R

To know {{the success or failure}} of the teaching and learning process, an assessment needs to be done. The result of an assessment can give beneficial information for students, teachers, schools, parents, and <b>other</b> <b>related</b> <b>parties</b> when it is done correctly. 	There are different types of assessments that can be applied in the language classes. Each has its own weaknesses and strengths. Commonly, the assessment can be grouped into two: standardized vs authentic, or traditional vs alternative, or formal vs informal assessment. Standardized, traditional, or formal assessment is the type of assessment that is considered as old paradigm. It usually refers to pencil and paper test. On the other hand, alternative, authentic, and informal assessment is the type considered as a new paradigm. It refers to assessment that requires students to create, produce, or do something. Which type should be used in assessing the students’ language competence? 	This paper will discuss the importance of both old paradigm (Traditional) and new paradigm (Alternative) to be used in assessing students’ language competences. Traditional assessment is practical, objective, and can cover large scope. However, it cannot portray the whole pictures of the students. Meanwhile, the alternative assessment shows the real language competence of the students, although it is quite often not practical. Therefore, to get a clear picture of the students’ language competences the two types of assessment must be combined in its implementation.

The internal and external users cannot obtain similar information regarding the knowledge based products from the standard financial statements, because the accounting standards are not designed to have in their focus the intangible assets, {{and as a consequence}} the information regarding the intangibles is “lost ” in income table as expense. In the function of measurement and management of intangibles several models have been developed. These models are divided in two main groups, monetary and non-monetary based models. These models can provide to the internal and external users more accurate information regarding the value and the management of intangible assets.

Corporate Tax, Personal Income Tax, Real Property Gains Tax, Estate Duty and Stamp Duty are an examples of direct taxes whereas indirect taxes consist of import duties, export duties, excise duties, sales tax and service tax. Goods and services tax (GST) is an example of indirect tax. Revenues from GST form a significant portion of government income in many countries. Despite the increasing popularity and success of GST implementation around the world, Malaysian citizens are not entirely convinced with the new tax regime which caused by their lower level of understanding of the benefits behind the implementation of GST. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the level of understanding of GST and also examine the relationship between the understanding of GST and spending behavior among consumers in Batu Pahat, Johor.
