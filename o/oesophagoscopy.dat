5000|$|Endoscopy {{is close}} to 100% {{sensitive}} {{for the detection of}} this disease, although again, some masses can be extra-oesophageal or, with inadequate insufflation of the oesophagus, completely undetectable. Patients undergoing anaesthesia for these procedures should not be premedicated with α2-agonists (medetomidine, xylazine) as this may raise aortic pressures and cause aneurismal rupture. It is important to us a methodical approach to gastro-oesophagoscopy; always start by advancing the scope to the stomach, retroflex the scope completely and check the inner cardiac sphincter for masses. Even a small 1 cm mass in this area can trigger profound vomition. Secondly, when doing <b>oesophagoscopy,</b> consider that you may not (a) have video-recoding facilities and (b) you may need to rescope to assess response to treatment, particularly if this isn’t a good resolution of symptoms, and you may need to check for neoplastic transformation (evidence as ulceration and necrosis of the mass). In this instance, use a spirocerca mapping chart so that you can record “before” and “after” sizes, numbers, location and appearance of the mass. Write the distance to the lower oesophageal sphincter in the centre. T ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Flexible <b>oesophagoscopy</b> is {{regarded}} as superior to rigid <b>oesophagoscopy</b> {{on the basis of}} perforation rates as an end point. This advantage may be more apparent than real because no comparison has been made in a diagnostic setting in patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus with both perforation rate and diagnostic efficacy as indices. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out on data on 336 diagnostic oesophagoscopies in patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus, comparing rigid with flexible <b>oesophagoscopy.</b> RESULTS: Both rigid and flexible oesophagoscopies were performed without perforation when they were used for diagnosis only. Rigid biopsy achieved a diagnostic success rate of 99. 3 %, compared with 80. 5 % for flexible <b>oesophagoscopy.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic <b>oesophagoscopy</b> can be achieved without perforation with either instrument, but the chance of diagnosing carcinoma was significantly greater with the rigid instrument...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} rigid <b>oesophagoscopy</b> in diagnostic and therapeutic settings in a consecutive series of 404 patients with oesophageal carcinoma were studied and compared to that for flexible <b>oesophagoscopy</b> in the same group. In addition, we examined the same parameters in a smaller group who had undergone radiotherapy with subsequent malignant stricturing. We performed 328 rigid procedures and 118 flexible procedures in a single regional surgical referral unit over a 7 year period. The combined perforation rate was 1. 3 %, with an overall mortality of 1 % from 446 procedures. We conclude that rigid <b>oesophagoscopy</b> {{in the presence of}} carcinoma retains an important diagnostic and therapeutic role which can be achieved with low incidence of perforation in high-risk patients...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} 49 year {{old man who}} {{presented}} with left leg weakness, frontal headache, impaired concentration and dysphagia.

The diagnosis of meningeal carcinomatosis was confirmed at post-mortem. Sudden bilateral blindness is a common feature of meningeal carcinomatosis but, as this is rare, it is not commonly considered in the differential diagnosis of visual loss.

Eleven electronic databases were searched for articles on transnasal <b>oesophagoscopy.</b> A total of 67 relevant titles were identified and 39 abstracts were screened of which 17 full- text articles were included in this report.

There was evidence to suggest potential cost savings by performing TNE in the office setting compared with conventional investigation and examination for dysphagia.

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} use of plain film {{radiology}} in the detection of fish and chicken bones in the upper aerodigestive tract. METHODS: This retrospective chart review was conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, and comprised medical charts of patients who had undergone <b>oesophagoscopy</b> for removal of fish and chicken bone from 1990 to 2015. SPSS 19 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Of the 24 patients, foreign body was detected on X-ray in 7 (29. 2 %) and through fibre optic laryngoscopy in 13 (54. 2 %). All the patients underwent surgical intervention for removal of the foreign body. Also, 19 (79. 2 %) patients underwent direct laryngoscopy and 5 (16. 7 %) required <b>oesophagoscopy.</b> The sensitivity with X-ray was 15 % and specificity was zero.

40|$|Seven {{patients}} with candidal oesophagitis were treated {{for up to}} 8 weeks with an intravenous infusion of miconazole, usually 600 mg given {{over a period of}} 30 - 60 minutes with a frequency depending upon the individual patient. As well as <b>oesophagoscopy,</b> biopsy and culture to establish the clinical course of the disease, a series of immunological investigations were performed, to assess the involvement of the patients' immune mechanisms, together with a whole battery of laboratory investigations to assess their response to the drug. A subjective improvement was observed in all patients after periods varying from 3 to 10 days and objective improvements were observed by <b>oesophagoscopy</b> by 5 of the patients in periods of one to four weeks. The same procedure showed 3 patients to have become completely normal after periods of one to three months.

40|$|Forty-one {{patients}} with {{carcinoma of the}} gullet and oesophagogastric junction have been investigated {{by means of a}} new pneumomediastinographic method of pertracheal insufflation. More than 1, 600 patients suffering from various pulmonary or mediastinal lesions have undergone this simple time-saving procedure. Pneumomediastinography cannot replace radiography of the gullet or <b>oesophagoscopy</b> in cases of cancer of the oesophagus. Since it reveals valuable details, which remain hidden in conventional radiographs or during <b>oesophagoscopy,</b> it may complement the findings of two traditional methods of investigation. The main advantages of pneumomediastinography in the diagnosis of cancer of the gullet are: it permits accurate assessment of {{the size and shape of}} the tumour; in patients submitted to radiotherapy, the local response to this treatment may be determined by changes in the size of the tumour shadow in pneumomediastinal tomograms; it establishes reliably that the tumour does not invade the adjacent organs; it facilitates visualization of some of the enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum which are not visible in conventional radiographs or tomograms; and the radiological characteristics of these lymph nodes facilitate an approximate differentiation between inflammatory and metastatic enlargements...|$|E
40|$|Complications {{occurred}} in a 41 -year-old woman (case 1) following a first attempt to remove a partial denture by <b>oesophagoscopy.</b> These were: laceration of the oesophagus with subsequent mediastinitis, pneumothorax, and pneumopericardium. With a second <b>oesophagoscopy</b> the denture {{was removed from the}} oesophagus using a flexible endoscope with a latex hood. Following antibiotic treatment the patient recovered. With a 45 -year-old man (case 2) who had also swallowed a denture, the denture initially could not be localized. It was eventually recovered from the gastric antrum using a flexible scope with a latex hood, also in the second attempt. Psychiatric and mentally handicapped patients run a high risk of denture ingestion. Ingested dental prostheses are often radiolucent, and are difficult to visualize using conventional radiological methods. Extraction of the ingested foreign objects can lead to severe complications. This is why in this type of case, we recommend having an expert remove from a foreign object {{with the use of a}} flexible scope fitted with a latex hood. It is advisable to make removable dental prostheses radiopaque or to avoid using them with the identified risk-group...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Accidental {{foreign body}} {{ingestion}} is common otolaryngological emergencies. Foreign body ingestion is encountered in {{both children and}} adults. Foreign body aspiration is commonly seen in children. Treatment of foreign body is prompt by invasive removal under general anaesthesia for maximum safety and minimal trauma. A total of 56 patients over 2 years’ period were studied. Early rigid oesophagoscopy/flexible bronchoscopy are effective and safe in removal of foreign body to prevent any complications. OBJECTIVES To evaluate early diagnosis and removal of foreign body in prevention of complications and to determine a common age group {{in the incidence of}} foreign body ingestion/aspiration.
