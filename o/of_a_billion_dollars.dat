25|$|Considerable debts owed to Iran by Israel for {{business}} conducted before the Iranian revolution, {{in the order}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>dollars,</b> were not paid to Iran. Some of the debt comes from oil purchased by Israel, and a larger amount arises from operation of the Trans-Israel oil pipeline and associated port facilities, which were {{a joint venture between}} Israeli companies and the National Iranian Oil Company. The Israeli cabinet decided against paying the debt at a meeting in 1979 and granted legal indemnity to the Israeli companies which owed it. At least one Israeli bank account is known to hold $250 million owed to Iran. Since the 1980s, Iran has been suing in the European courts for payment of the debt and has won several cases. However payment of the debt is legally complicated by the international sanctions against Iran and by the fact that Israel classifies Iran as an enemy state. In May 2015 a European court ordered the Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline Company to pay $1.1 billion to Iran, which Israel refused to do.|$|E

500|$|The {{means of}} {{generating}} such a controlled reaction were uncertain, {{and the data}} obtained {{would not be as}} useful as that from a full-scale explosion. Oppenheimer argued that the [...] "implosion gadget must be tested in a range where the energy release is comparable with that contemplated for final use." [...] In March 1944, he obtained Groves's tentative approval for testing a full-scale explosion inside a containment vessel, although Groves was still worried about how he would explain the loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>dollars</b> worth of plutonium to a Senate Committee {{in the event of a}} failure.|$|E
500|$|Groves did not {{relish the}} {{prospect}} of explaining the loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>dollars</b> worth of plutonium to a Senate committee, so a cylindrical containment vessel codenamed [...] "Jumbo" [...] was constructed to recover the active material {{in the event of}} a failure. Measuring [...] long and [...] wide, it was fabricated at great expense from [...] of iron and steel by Babcock & Wilcox in Barberton, Ohio. Brought in a special railroad car to a siding in Pope, New Mexico, it was transported the last [...] to the test site on a trailer pulled by two tractors. By the time it arrived, confidence in the implosion method was high enough, and the availability of plutonium was sufficient, that Oppenheimer decided not to use it. Instead, it was placed atop a steel tower [...] from the weapon as a rough measure of how powerful the explosion would be. In the end, Jumbo survived, although its tower did not, adding credence to the belief that Jumbo would have successfully contained a fizzled explosion.|$|E
500|$|By 2001 {{and nearly}} {{eighteen}} years of stagnant growth, {{many of its}} franchises were {{in some sort of}} financial distress. [...] The lack of growth severely impacted Burger King's largest franchise, the nearly 400-store AmeriKing; the company, which until this point had been struggling under a nearly $300million debt load and been shedding stores across the US, was forced to enter Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The failure of AmeriKing accompanied with declining market position deeply affected the value of the company, and put negotiations between Diageo and the TPC Capital-lead group on hold. The developments eventually forced Diageo to lower the total selling price by almost three-quarters <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>dollars.</b> After the sale, newly appointed CEO Bradley Blum initiated a program to help the roughly 20 percent of its franchises, including its four largest, who were in financial distress, bankruptcy or had ceased operations altogether. Partnering with the California-based Trinity Capital, LLC, the company established the Franchisee Financial Restructuring Initiative, a program to address the financial issues facing BK's financially distressed franchisees. The initiative was designed to assist franchisees in restructuring their businesses in order to meet financial obligations, focus on restaurant operational excellence, reinvest in their operations and return to profitability.|$|E

He sold his share in the business in 1986 and retired with his family to Germany to work with the international relief organization Salem International.
