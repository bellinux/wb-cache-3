40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a treatise on the rendering <b>of</b> <b>focused</b> sources using wave field synthesis (WFS). The thesis describes the fundamental theory of WFS and {{presents a}} thorough derivation <b>of</b> <b>focused</b> source driving functions including, monopoles, dipoles and pistonic sources. The principle characteristics <b>of</b> <b>focused</b> sources including, array truncation, spatial aliasing, pre-echo artefacts, colouration and amplitude errors are analysed in depth {{and a new}} spatial aliasing criterion is presented for focused sources. Additionally a new secondary source selection protocol is presented allowing for directed and symmetrically rendered sources. This thesis also describes how the low frequency rendering <b>of</b> <b>focused</b> sources {{is limited by the}} <b>focusing</b> ability <b>of</b> the loudspeaker array and thus derives a formula to predict the focusing limits and the corresponding focal shift that occurs at low frequencies and with short arrays. Subsequently a frequency dependent position correction is derived which increases the positional accuracy of the source. Other characteristics and issues with the rendering <b>of</b> <b>focused</b> sources are also described including the use of large arrays, rendering <b>of</b> moving <b>focused</b> sources, issues with multiple focused sources in the scene, the phase response, and the focal point size <b>of</b> <b>focused</b> sound field. The perceptual characteristics are also covered, with {{a review of the literature}} and a series of subjective tests into the localisation <b>of</b> <b>focused</b> sources. It is shown that an improvement in the localisation can be achieved by including the virtual first order images as point sources into the WFS rendering. Practical rendering <b>of</b> <b>focused</b> sources is generally done in compromised scenarios such as in non-anechoic, reverberant rooms which contain various scattering objects. These issues are also covered in this thesis with the aid of finite difference time domain models which allow the characterisation of room effects on the reproduced field, it is shown that room effects can actually even out spatial aliasing artefacts and therefore reduce the perception of colouration. Scattering objects can also be included in the model, thus the effects of scattering are also shown and a method of correcting for the scattering is suggested. Also covered is the rendering <b>of</b> <b>focused</b> sources using elevated arrays which can introduce position errors in the rendering...|$|R

40|$|This {{exploratory}} {{investigation was}} conducted to uncover the influence of toy type, level of toy difficulty, and temperament on the duration <b>of</b> <b>focused</b> attention in young children. A total of 28 children, all attending childcare centers, {{participated in this study}} and were aged between 33 and 39 months. Each child participated in two play sessions and played with two types of toys of two different levels of difficulty for a 4 -minute period. The children's parents and educators were asked to complete a temperament questionnaire for each child. The duration <b>of</b> <b>focused</b> attention for each child was calculated through analysis of the recoded play sessions. Results indicated that children showed a longer duration <b>of</b> <b>focused</b> attention during play with construction toys than during play with puzzles.

40|$|Background: Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported multiple activation foci associated {{with a variety of}} conditions, stimuli or tasks. However, most of these studies used fewer than 40 participants. Methodology: After extracting data (number of subjects, condition studied, number <b>of</b> <b>foci</b> identified and threshold) from 94 brain fMRI meta-analyses (k = 1, 788 unique datasets) published through December of 2011, we analyzed the correlation between individual study sample sizes and number <b>of</b> significant <b>foci</b> reported. We also performed an analysis where we evaluated each meta-analysis to test whether there was a correlation between the sample size of the meta-analysis and the number <b>of</b> <b>foci</b> that it had identified. Correlation coefficients were then combined across all meta-analyses to obtain a summary correlation coefficient with a fixed effects model and we combine correlation coefficients, using a Fisherâ€™s z transformation. Principal Findings: There was no correlation between sample size and the number <b>of</b> <b>foci</b> reported in single studies (r = 0. 0050) but there was a strong correlation between sample size and number <b>of</b> <b>foci</b> in meta-analyses (r = 0. 62, p, 0. 001).

5|$|Desert Strike was {{followed}} by four sequels Jungle Strike, Urban Strike, Soviet Strike, and Nuclear Strike that expanded on the basic gameplay it established. The design staff made efforts to retain game mechanics they felt embodied {{the core of the}} original. They believed removing those elements would result in a loss <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> of what attracted fans. As the series moved to more advanced consoles, Posehn became less involved in the programming side of development. Jungle Strike and Urban Strike, both released for the Genesis, featured additional vehicles and locations. Soviet Strike, released for the original PlayStation and the Sega Saturn in 1996, featured 3D graphics, as did Nuclear Strike, released on PC and PlayStation in 1997 and the Nintendo 64 in 1999. A fifth sequel provisionally titled Future Strike was planned, but the game was eventually released as , a mech-based shooter game.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau {{created a}} tourist route {{that is a}} {{predecessor}} of the modern Great Lakes Circle Tours (GLCT). The Great Lakes Automobile Route {{was a series of}} roads on both the Upper and Lower peninsulas of Michigan. It included US31 between Manistee and the Benton Harborâ€“St. Joseph area. The concept did not last a year; the American entry into World War I and a lack <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> on a single route consigned the idea into obscurity. The idea of a tourist route around the Great Lakes was revived in 1986 as a pet project of Michigan First Lady Paula Blanchard. MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Ontario created the GLCT scheme which includes the LMCT that follows US31 from Lake Michigan Beach northward to Manistee and from Traverse City north to the terminus near Mackinaw City excluding locations where business loops run closer to the lake at South Haven, Muskegon, Whitehallâ€“Montague and Pentwater.|$|E
5|$|In {{completing}} missions, {{the player}} can have Talion engage in melee, ranged combat, and stealth approaches, with some missions rewarding the player more for completing the mission {{in a specific}} manner. Talion's ranger abilities are enhanced through Celebrimbor, allowing the player to mix combat with special focus-based attacks; these latter attacks {{can be used to}} slow time down while aiming with the bow, drain focus out of an enemy foe, or, later in the game, brand the foe to become an ally of Talion. The combat system uses an attack-chain system that enables the player to perform special moves after building the chain to a large enough value, such as instantly draining a foe <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> or performing an area focus attack. With the combat system, they can also counter and dodge attacks. Stealth is a critical element in some missions; several areas are considered Strongholds and should Talion's presence be discovered, an alarm will sound and more Uruks will arrive to try to kill him.|$|E
5|$|Max Payne 2 {{uses the}} same game engine as the one used in Max Payne, but with several {{significant}} upgrades. Even though the game only supports DirectX 8.1, the graphics in Max Payne 2 mimic those generated by DirectX 9 by making optimal use of effects such as reflection, refraction, shaders, and ghosting. The developers considered one particular scene in which effects are used well: When Max has lucid dreams, the screen appears fuzzy and out <b>of</b> <b>focus.</b> Since Max Payne, the polygon count (the number of polygons rendered per frame) has been increased, which smooths out the edges of character models. In addition, characters have a much greater range of expressions. Previously, Max had only one expression available; in Max Payne 2, he often smirks and moves his eyebrows to react to different scenarios.|$|E

5|$|Reflector sights {{were invented}} as an {{improved}} gun-sight and since their invention {{they have been}} adapted to many types of weapons. When used with different types of guns, reflector sights are considered an improvement over simple iron sights (sights composed of two spaced metal aiming points {{that have to be}} aligned). Iron sights take considerable experience and skill in the user who has to hold a proper eye position and focus exclusively on the front sight, keeping it centered on the (unfocused) rear sight, while keeping the whole centered on a target at different distances, requiring alignment of all three planes <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> to achieve a hit. The reflector sight's single, parallax-free virtual image, in focus with the target, removes this aiming problem, helping poor, average, and expert shooters alike.|$|E

From some experiments, it was found that glassy cavities can, as focusing cavities, be closely related to the generation of severe erosion. A simplified cascading process <b>of</b> the <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> collapse energy is also assumed for the glassy cavity. Furthermore, erosion tests results showed that any type of fluctuations in the <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> the collapse energy lead to a decrease of the collapse pressure and thus a decrease of the erosion...|$|R
40|$|Pre-radiation dental {{screening}} of head-neck cancer patients aims {{to identify and}} eliminate oral <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> infection to prevent post-radiation oral problems. The evidence for the efficacy of dental screening is unclear. In this systematic review, we analyzed available evidence on the efficacy of pre-radiation elimination <b>of</b> oral <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> infection in preventing oral sequelae. A search was conducted (MEDLINE/EMBASE) for papers published up to May 2014. Papers on head-neck cancer patients subjected to pre-radiation dental screening, (chemo) radiation and oral follow-up were included. Of the 1770 identified papers, 20 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria of which 17 were retrospective. A great heterogeneity in patient groups, dental screening techniques, definitions <b>of</b> oral <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> infection and techniques for eliminating foci was found. Most papers lacked essential details on how dental screening was performed and a clear definition <b>of</b> an oral <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> infection. The evidence for efficacy of elimination <b>of</b> oral <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> infection to prevent post-radiotherapy oral sequelae was inconclusive. Consequently, the efficacy of pre-radiation elimination <b>of</b> oral <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> infection remains unclear. No conclusions can be drawn about a definition <b>of</b> an oral <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> infection and whether pre-radiation elimination <b>of</b> these <b>foci</b> should be mandatory. We therefore suggest prospective studies with well-defined criteria for oral <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> infection, a clear description <b>of</b> which <b>foci</b> were eliminated and how, {{a detailed description of}} pre-radiation dental screening, clearly described patient and tumor characteristics, and a detailed dental history and dental status. Subsequently, oral problems that occur post-radiation should be systematically recorded. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
