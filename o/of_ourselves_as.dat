25|$|According to Kant, {{we think}} <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> having free will. This lets us make {{judgments}} such as “you {{ought to have}} done that thing {{that you did not}} do.” Kant argues that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our experience. We can be sure that this concept of freedom doesn't come from experience because experience itself contradicts it. Our experience is of everything in the sensible world and in the sensible world, everything that happens does so in accord with the laws of nature and {{there is no room for}} a free will to influence events.|$|E
25|$|In section three, Kant {{argues that}} we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. The fact of freedom means that we are bound by the moral law. In the course of his discussion, Kant {{establishes}} two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves. We can view ourselves as members of the world of appearances – which operates according to the laws of nature – or we can view ourselves as members of the intellectual world, which is how we view ourselves when we think <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> having free wills and when we think about how to act. These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how we can have free wills, {{despite the fact that the}} world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would like to be able to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. This is because the intellectual world - in which morality is grounded - is something that we cannot make positive claims about.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{the end of}} the Beatles' {{performing}} career, McCartney sensed unease in {{the band}} and wanted them to maintain creative productivity. He pressed them to start a new project, which became Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, widely regarded as rock's first concept album. McCartney was inspired to create a new persona for the group, to serve as a vehicle for experimentation and to demonstrate to their fans that they had musically matured. He invented the fictional band of the album's title track. As McCartney explained, [...] "We were fed up with being the Beatles. We really hated that fucking four little mop-top approach. We were not boys we were men... and [...] thought <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> artists rather than just performers." ...|$|E

2500|$|In principle, [...] "So {{act as if}} your maxims {{should serve}} {{at the same time}} as the {{universal}} law (of all rational beings)", meaning that we should so act that we may think <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a member in the universal realm of ends", legislating universal laws through our maxims (that is, a universal code of conduct), in a [...] "possible realm of ends". None may elevate themselves above the universal law, therefore it is one's duty to follow the maxim(s).|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{greatest}} religious problems is that people fear having a relationship with God and consequently distance themselves from Him. Just as angels serve God without fear despite their lower status in comparison to God, so too human beings should take their model (walk amongst them) and not be afraid of developing a relationship with God and serving Him. This represents a wholeness that we as human beings are capable of only if we think <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> walking amongst angels. (Sfas Emes, Parshat Beha'alotecha 5636) ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{several of}} his later publications, {{especially}} Beyond Theology and The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are, Watts put forward a worldview, drawing on Hinduism, Chinese philosophy, pantheism or panentheism, and modern science, in which he maintains that the whole universe consists of a cosmic Self playing hide-and-seek (Lila); hiding from itself (Maya) by becoming all the living and non-living things in the universe and forgetting {{what it really is}} – the upshot being that we are all IT in disguise. In this worldview, Watts asserts that our conception <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> an [...] "ego in a bag of skin," [...] or [...] "skin-encapsulated ego" [...] is a myth; the entities we call the separate [...] "things" [...] are merely aspects or features of the whole.|$|E

60|$|The gift <b>of</b> seeing <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> {{others see}} us is, as the poet indicates, vouchsafed to few men. Lord Belpher, not {{being one of}} these fortunates, had not the {{slightest}} conception how intensely revolting his personal appearance was at that moment. The red-rimmed eyes, the growth of stubble on the cheeks, and the thick coating of mud which had resulted from his rambles in the ditch combined to render him a horrifying object.|$|R
2500|$|Helen Chadwick (18 May 1953 – 15 March 1996) was a British sculptor, {{photographer}} and installation artist. In 1987, she {{became one of}} the first women artists to be nominated for the Turner Prize. Chadwick was known for [...] "challenging stereotypical perceptions of the body in elegant yet unconventional forms. [...] Her work draws from a range of sources, from myths to science, grappling with a plethora of unconventional, visceral materials that included chocolate, lambs tongues and rotting vegetable matter. Her skilled use of traditional fabrication methods and sophisticated technologies transform these unusual materials into complex installations. Maureen Paley noted that [...] "Helen was always talking about craftsmanship—a constant fount of information". Binary oppositions was a strong theme in Chadwick's work; seductive/repulsive, male/female, organic/man-made. Her combinations [...] "emphasise yet simultaneously dissolve the contrasts between them". Her gender representations forge a sense of ambiguity and a disquieting sexuality blurring the boundaries <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> singular and stable beings." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jagabandhu {{tried to}} arrange best {{possible}} education for their children. He got Pritilata admitted in Dr. Khastagir Government Girls' School of Chittagong. Pritilata was a meritorious student. A {{teacher in the}} school, whom students affectionately used called Usha Di, used stories of Rani Lakshmibai to inspire nationalism in her students. Kalpana Datta, a classmate of Pritilata, writes in the biography Chittagong Armoury Raiders– [...] "We had no clear idea in our school days about our future. Then the Rani of Jhansi fired our imagination with her example. Sometimes {{we used to think}} <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> fearless...". Arts and literature were Pritilata's favourite subjects. She passed out of Dr. Khastagir Government Girls' School in 1928 and in 1929, got admitted to the Eden College, Dhaka. In the Intermediate examinations, she stood first among all students who appeared in that year's examination from the Dhaka Board. As a student in Eden College, she participated in various social activities. She joined the group Sree Sangha, headed by Leela Nag, under the banner Dipali Sangha.|$|E
2500|$|Powell {{wrote an}} article for The Times on 29 June, in which he said: [...] "The Falklands have brought {{to the surface of}} the British mind our latent {{perception}} <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>as</b> a sea animal.... No assault on a landward possession would have evoked the same automatic defiance, tinged with a touch of that self sufficiency which belongs to all nations". The United States' response was [...] "very different but just as deep an instinctual reaction... the United States have an almost neurotic sense of vulnerability... its two coastlines, its two theatres, its two navies are separated by the entire length of the New World... she lives with... the nightmare of having one day to fight a decisive sea battle without the benefit of concentration, the perpetual spectre of naval 'war on two fronts'." [...] Powell added: [...] "The Panama Canal from 1914 onwards could never quite exorcise the spectre.... It was the position of the Falkland Islands in relation to that route which gave and gives them their significance—for the United States above all. The British people have become uneasily aware that their American allies would prefer the Falkland Islands to pass out of Britain's possession into hands which, if not wholly American, might be amenable to American control. In fact, the American struggle to wrest the islands from Britain has only commenced in earnest now that the fighting is over". Powell then said there was [...] "the Hispanic factor": [...] "If we could gather together all the anxieties for the future which in Britain cluster around race relations... and then attribute them, translated into Hispanic terms, to the Americans, we would have something of the phobias which haunt the United States and addressed itself to the aftermath of the Falklands campaign".|$|E
