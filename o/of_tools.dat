40|$|It {{is still}} unclear on what and how tool and learner {{characteristics}} influence tool use and consequently performance in computer-based learning environments (CBLE’s). This study examines the relationships between tool-related characteristics (tool presentation: non-/embedded tool and instructional cues: non-/explained tool functionality) and learner-related characteristics (self-efficacy and goal orientation) {{as well as their}} effects on tool use (quantity and quality) and performance in a CBLE. One hundred and forty students, without statically difference in prior knowledge, were randomly assigned to the four conditions (Embedded and non-embedded with explained tool functionality and embedded and non-embedded with non-explained tool functionality) to study a hypertext. Results reveal that embedding tools influenced positively quantity <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> use and negatively quality <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> use.

5|$|Since tool use is {{considered}} to be a key feature of primate intelligence, the apparent lack of this behavior in wild lemurs, as well as the lack of non-food object play, has helped reinforce the perception that lemurs are less intelligent than their simian cousins. However, another study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve examined the representation of tool functionality in both the ring-tailed lemur and the common brown lemur and discovered that, like monkeys, they used tools with functional properties (e.g., tool orientation or ease of use) instead <b>of</b> <b>tools</b> with nonfunctional features (e.g., color or texture). Although the ring-tailed lemur may not use tools in the wild, it can not only be trained to use a tool, but will preferentially select tools based on their functional qualities. Therefore, the conceptual competence to use a tool may have been present in the common primate ancestor, even though the use <b>of</b> <b>tools</b> may not have appeared until much later.|$|E

40|$|Tool use {{was once}} {{considered}} the sole domain of humans. Over the last 40 years, however, {{it has become}} apparent that tool use may be widespread across the animal kingdom. Pioneering studies in primates have shaped {{the way we think}} about tool use in animals, but have also lead to a bias both in terms of our expectations about which animals should be capable <b>of</b> using <b>tools</b> and the working definition <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> use. Here I briefly examine tool use in terrestrial animals and consider the constraints of the current working definition <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> use in fishes. Fishes lack grasping limbs and operate underwater where there are clear constraints with respect to the physics <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> use that differ dramatically from the terrestrial environment. I then examine all of the documented accounts <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> use in fishes. The review reveals that tool use seems to be confined to a limited number of fish taxa, particularly the wrasse, which may show similarities with the greater than expected number <b>of</b> examples <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> use in primates and corvids amongst mammals and birds, respectively. As fish are seldom studied as intensely as birds and mammals, there is a clear need for further observation <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> use in fishes. It is likely that further examples will be unveiled allowing us to perform comparative analyses of the evolution <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> use in fish. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Once {{considered}} only a human behavior, reports <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> use by {{a variety}} of animals have accumulated. Likewise, various definitions <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> use have also amassed. Although some researchers argue that understanding the evolutionary drivers <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> use is more important than identifying and describing these behaviors, the central issue of defining what constitutes tool use has not been fully addressed. Here we analyze prominent definitions <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> use and review the application of these definitions in scientific and educational literature. We demonstrate that many behaviors recently described as tool use do not meet criteria for prevalent definitions, while other neglected behaviors may constitute a form <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> use. These examples show how the use of inconsistent definitions <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> use in research can result in different conclusions from the same observations. Our aim is to demonstrate that a universally acceptable definition <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> use based on traditional, evolutionary, and operational understanding of behavior is needed. The rationale is that this review will stimulate the consistent and explicit use of specific terminology in tool use research. This would help define specific examples of each natural observation from a common measuring stick, allowing better comparative studies and classification of these unique behaviors. // </script...|$|R

40|$|CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tools {{have played}} a {{critical}} role in improving software productivity and quality by assisting tasks in software development processes since 1970 ’s. Several parametric software cost models adopt “use <b>of</b> software <b>tools</b> ” as one of environmental factors that affect software development productivity. However, most software development teams use CASE tools that are assembled over time and adopt new tools without establishing formal evaluation criteria. Several software cost models assess the productivity impacts <b>of</b> CASE <b>tools</b> based just on breadth <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> coverage without considering other productivity dimensions such as degree <b>of</b> integration, <b>tool</b> maturity, and user support.
