50|$|During {{the later}} {{developments}} of the engine compression ratios were lowered, then raised. Pistons were lightened 20 percent along with connecting rods to reduce the reciprocating mass inside the engine. Aluminum pistons are slightly domed with valve pockets. Pistons have three rings installed, two compression and one <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
50|$|Where the RC30 {{had used}} roller {{bearings}} on the camshafts, the RC45 used more conventional plain bearings. The RC30 {{had used a}} piston with one compression ring and <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> to reduce friction. This was very effective for racing but resulted in increased oil consumption in the road-going bikes. The RC45 changed to the more conventional two compression ring system, also with an <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring.</b> It used low friction rings and a molybdenum disulphide coating on smaller piston skirts to reduce friction. One huge change in engine architecture was the change from centre gear drive mechanism to crank/camshaft drive, which was located {{on the end of}} the crankshaft (another NR750 follow on). This reduced the number of engine crankshaft bearings by one and camshaft bearings by four with an associated reduction in friction. This overall reduction in friction also allowed the engine to see the higher engine revolutions Honda desired without losing horsepower. The RC45 also followed the RC30 in using titanium connecting rods in a revised format, made lighter and stronger, to help cope with the extra rpm the moving parts of a race engine were expected to see.|$|E

For the engine simulation, conditions close to the top reversal and at mid-stroke were simulated. Different micro-dimple geometries were considered, as well as full and partial texturing. As main conclusion, micro-dimples on the bore and rings were able to generate significant hydrodynamic support with potential to reduce both friction and wear. A special benefit was predicted when the micro-dimples were on the flat surface of the <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>rings...</b>|$|R
50|$|The spring backed oil {{rings and}} the cast iron oil rings have {{essentially}} the same range of peripheral forms which consist of two scraping lands of various detailed form. The multipiece <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>rings</b> usually consist of two rails or segments (these are thin steel rings) with a spacer expander spring which keeps the two rails apart and provides the radial load.|$|R
50|$|For the 1990 model year, all Blazers {{now had a}} {{standard}} rear wheel anti-lock braking system. A new electronic speedometer system, with a 6 digit odometer on the dashboard was also introduced for 1990, along with non-asbestos brake linings. A new brake warning light on the dashboard was also introduced for 1990. The Blazer body also used double sided, galvanized exterior sheet metal. A new option for 1990 was power mirrors. The 5.7-liter V-8 (L05) engine was improved for 1990 {{with the addition of}} improved <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>rings,</b> a redesigned rear crankshaft seal, a new camshaft sprocket design, non-asbestos intake manifold gaskets, and heavy-duty intake valves.|$|R
50|$|The '3E' and '3E-E' {{engines are}} {{considered}} slightly less reliable than other Toyota engines, {{although they are}} also among the easiest engines to service. The most common problems affecting these engines are premature valve stem seal (nitrile) failure, carbon buildup on the intake valves, and collapse of the <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> on the piston. Any of these conditions can lead to rough idling, stalling, and fouled spark plugs, and therefore need to be differentially diagnosed. The valve stem seals, at least, can be replaced with silicone or viton-based seals which last much longer.|$|E
50|$|Engines for {{vehicles}} {{are equipped with}} an air compressor, to supply compressed air for the brakes. It is an air-cooled single-cylinder air-compressor driven by a belt. The air-intake is next to the engine intake manifold. The crankcase is not divided, the crankshaft is forged and has two ball bearings. The pushrod is housed in a needle bearing, the piston journal has a plain bearing pressed into the push rod bore. The piston has two piston rings and one <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring.</b> Lubrication is done by a dry sump lubrication system, the compressor valves are poppet valves.|$|E
50|$|Mark IV engines saw {{extensive}} {{application in}} Chevrolet and GMC medium duty trucks, {{as well as}} in Blue Bird Corporation's All American and TC/2000 transit buses (the latter up until 1995, using a 427 with purpose-built carburetor). In addition to the 427, a 366-cubic-inch (6.0 L) version was produced for the commercial market. Both the 366 and 427 commercial versions were built with a raised-deck, four-bolt main bearing cap cylinder to accommodate an extra <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> on the pistons. Unfortunately, the raised deck design complicated the use of the block in racing applications, as standard intake manifolds required spacers for proper fit. Distributors with adjustable collars that allowed adjustments to the length of the distributor shaft also had to be used with 366 and 427 truck blocks.|$|E
50|$|Most {{automotive}} pistons {{have three}} rings: The top two while also <b>controlling</b> <b>oil</b> are primarily for compression sealing (compression rings); the lower <b>ring</b> is for <b>controlling</b> {{the supply of}} oil to the liner which lubricates the piston skirt and the compression <b>rings</b> (<b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>rings).</b> At least two piston rings are found on most piston and cylinder combination. Typical compression ring designs will have an essentially rectangular cross section or a keystone (right angled trapezoidal) cross section. The periphery will then have either a barrel profile (top compression rings) or a taper napier form (second compression rings or scraper rings). There are some taper faced top rings and on some old engines simple plain faced rings were used.|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} the thesis is {{tribology}} of piston rings for internal combustion engines. The work is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter deals with the piston rings, piston rings requirements, describes the main functions of piston rings, types of piston rings, compression <b>rings</b> and <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>rings.</b> Finally, this chapter provides information about the kinematics of piston rings. The second chapter presents the mechanism of friction and lubrication of piston rings, is dedicated to tribology, friction, friction observation history, mechanism of friction and friction suitability. In addition, the work contains information about lubrication, specifically about a lubrication way of internal combustion engines and lubrication regimes. The third chapter deals with hydrodynamic lubrication. The {{theme of the}} fourth chapter is boundary lubrication. The fifth chapter provides information about mixed lubrication.

40|$|In modern {{marine diesel}} engines, power output and {{in-cylinder}} firing pressures are constantly increasing, leading to higher friction in engine components {{and especially in}} the piston assembly. A good understanding of the friction contributions of the various engine components is needed, if mechanical efficiency is to be improved. A friction model for the engine piston assembly has been developed and is presented in this paper. The model, based on lubrication theory, considers the detailed engine geometry and the complete lubricant action, and thus can be applied {{to a wide range of}} engines. In detail, the analysis takes into account the friction components of compression <b>rings,</b> <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>rings,</b> piston skirt and gudgeon pin of the engine piston assembly. The model was applied to a four-stroke (medium speed) marine diesel engine and the effect of engine speed and load on friction was examined and compared with results from other semi-empirical models. The engine friction was predicted at constant rotational speed (generator operation) and variable rotational speed (propulsion operation). (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|Piston {{rings are}} subject to wear as they {{move up and down}} the {{cylinder}} bore due to their own inherent load and due to the gas load acting on the ring. To minimize this, they are made of wear-resistant materials, such as cast iron and steel, and are coated or treated to enhance the wear resistance. Two-stroke port design is critical to ring life. Newer modern motorcycle manufacturers have many single function but serrated ports to retain the ring. Typically, top ring and oil control rings will be coated with chromium, or Nitrided, possibly plasma sprayed [...] or have a PVD (physical vapour deposition) ceramic coating. For enhanced scuff resistance and further improved wear, most modern diesel engines have top rings coated with a modified chromium coating known as CKS or GDC, a patent coating from Goetze which has aluminium oxide or diamond particles respectively included in the chrome surface. The lower <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> is designed to leave a lubricating oil film, a few micrometres thick on the bore, as the piston descends. Three piece oil rings, i.e. with two rails and one spacer, are used for four-stroke gasoline engines.|$|E
50|$|The engine has a forged crankshaft, {{supported}} in changeable thin-wall bearing shells. The journals of the crankshaft and the connecting rods are polished and induction hardened. The counter-weights are screwed {{on the center}} and outer crank arms. The flywheel {{is connected to the}} power take-off side of the engine with screws. The gear drive side of the crankshaft is equipped with a gear, which drives the oil pump and the gear which drives the camshaft. The connecting rods are forged and weight-balanced. While the small connecting rod bore has a bearing pressed into the bore, the crank-sided bore of the connecting rod has a thin-wall bearing. For lubrication and cooling of the connecting rods they have small oil-ducts. Oil is pressed in the ducts from a nozzle at the upper side of the connecting rod. The piston journals are secured with two circlips and are bathed in oil. A heat resistant light-metal-alloy is used for the cast pistons. The combustion chamber is integrated into the piston. For compression, the pistons have two piston rings which slots are cast into the piston. The pistons are also equipped with an <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring.</b> The cylinder liners are made of centrifugally cast iron, two rubber rings seal the liners off from the crankcase. The engine has two cast iron cylinder blocks with two cylinders; every block has a head, which makes two cylinder heads.|$|E
50|$|The {{crankcase}} is {{a single}} cast piece, the drop-forged crankshaft with counter weights screwed on is supported in bearings made of steel-lead-bronze. The crank and shaft pins of the crankshaft are heat-hardened. Due to the air-cooling of the engine, the cylinders have cooling fins made of centrifugal cast metal. The combustion chamber of the engine {{is a part of}} the piston bowls because of the direct injection. The pistons are made of a special highly heat resistant light metal alloy, they have three piston rings and one <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring.</b> The connecting rods are cranked as well as the lower crank ends. The lower big crank ends are made of steel-lead-bronze, the upper small crank ends are made of special-bronze. The camshaft is supported by rolling bearings. The overhead valves are pushed by rockers and pushrods. The cylinder head {{is a single}} piece made of low pressure chill cast highly heat resistant light metal alloy. The air filter of the engine is a wet filter. For dusty environments MWM offered an oil bath air filter. The air intake must not draw in hot air; this would reduce the engine power output. The fuel is pumped by a Bosch pump. The fuel pump is controlled by a centrifugal control mechanism using a pushrod. The control trap makes it possible to change the injection time at the engine start-up to pump more fuel into the cylinder. A forced feed lubrication system lubricates the engine, powered by a gear oil pump. The oil is filtered by a strainer in the low pressure circuit and a fine sieve strainer in the high pressure circuit. A gap filter in the high pressure circuit was also available. The cooling is done by an axial cooling fan powered by the crankshaft using a belt. The power can be taken off the flywheel or the PTO-shaft. An electric motor can be used to start the engine as well as a crank. The AKD 112 Z does not have glow plugs but a decompression system.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. One {{of the key}} conjunctions in the IC engine is that made by the top {{compression}} ring to the cylinder liner. Although the compression ring has seen considerable improvements since its introduction into steam engines by John Ramsbottom in the 1850 s, its multiple and often contradictory functions still remain a challenge today. The primary aim {{has always been to}} seal the combustion chamber and guard against leakage of combustion gasses. The ring is also required to conduct some of the generated heat away. These requirements call for good ring-bore conformance, but often at the expense of increased friction. A simplified inter-ring gas flow model, as well as the measured chamber pressure using a Kistler pressure transducer is carried out under motored conditions to obtain the net gas pressure acting behind the ring. This and the elastic pressure as the result of ring restoring tension force in fitment constitute the contact load, which is usually carried by a mixed-hydrodynamic regime of lubrication. The conjunction pressures are treated as a combination of hydrodynamic generated pressures and asperity-pair interactions. The former is obtained by solution of two dimensional Reynolds equation, whilst the latter is determined assuming a Gaussian distribution of asperities on the counterfaces. Surface topography of the bounding solids; the compression ring and the liner are measured and used as appropriate statistical functions in the Greenwood and Tripp model. Using an analytical flow model, pressure acting behind the ring (on the inner periphery of the ring) is obtained, leading to the calculation of ring-bore friction. A floating liner is used to measure friction of piston and ringpack in situ. The characteristic of the predicted variations are compared with the measured data. However, a quantitative comparison is not possible as the measured data corresponds to all the conjunctions of piston system, including the <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>rings</b> as well as the piston skirt. The results show that variation of gas force behind the ring significantly changes the ring-bore contact, thus friction and the nature of interactions...|$|R

40|$|Twin-land <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> {{is widely}} used in the {{automotive}} diesel engines, and is gaining more and more applications in the modern designs of gasoline engines. Its interaction with the cylinder liner surface accounts for around 10 % of the total frictional losses within an internal combustion engine, and {{is the most important}} factor that affects the lubricant oil consumption. A twin-land <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> model is developed based on the deterministic hydrodynamic method by Li et al. [31] and the Greenwood Tripp asperity contact model [39]. Unlike the traditional methods of piston ring pack modeling determined by the ring face macro profile which hardly exists on the twin-land <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring,</b> the model considers the liner finish micro geometry, and uses a correlation method to predict the behavior of the ring liner interaction in both frictions losses and oil control. The model is used to study the effect of some key design parameters of the twin-land <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring,</b> including the unit load pressure, the ring tension and the ring axial land width. The results show a large potential of the model in the optimization of the twin-land <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> design. Although many non-conventional cylinder liner finishes are now being developed to reduce friction and oil consumption, the effects of surface finish on ring-pack performance is not well understood. To solver this mystery, the twin-land <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> model and Li's deterministic hydrodynamic model are used to study the effect of the liner finish micro geometry. Several key parameters of liner finish texture are examined, and the analytical results show important effects of some of these key parameters on the twin-land <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> friction losses as well as the lubricant oil control. (cont.) These key parameters include the surface wavelength of the plateau part, the frequency of deep valleys and the honing cross-hatch angle.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} interest in decreasing {{the environmental impact}} from internal combustion engines as well as increasing the fuel efficiency has led to deeper investigation into {{the components of the}} engine. The mechanical friction in an engine is a major concern, any improvements or reductions in friction can have large implication on the' efficiency of the engines. This thesis focuses on the piston/ ring pack assembly and its contribution to friction. It investigates several key components and trends in friction for the piston/ ring pack assembly, specifically the trends related to the <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> and the liner surface. The Floating Liner Engine is used in this study to isolate results from different components. The data collected can be used for comparative analysis and to identify trends in the friction trace. The thesis starts with describing the Floating Liner Engine system at MIT in detail. Both the data collection and the hardware systems are described as well as the test capabilities of the Floating Liner Engine. The results used in the thesis have been collected using the motoring condition. The <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> {{plays a key role in}} controlling the supply of oil to the top two rings and hence has a higher tension that the top two rings. This leads to the <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> having a significant contribution to the total friction of the system. The two most prevalent oil control rings used in the industry are the twin land <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> (TLOCR) and the three piece <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> (TPOCR). The thesis investigates the effect of changing liner roughness on the friction of the TLOCR. A comparison between the TLOCR and the TPOCR is also performed using the same liner surfaces.

40|$|The ring {{spinning}} {{process has been}} used to produce fine and high quality staple fibre yarns. The stability of the rotating yarn loop (i. e. balloon) between the yarn-guide and the traveller-ring is crucial to the success and economics of this process. Balloon <b>control</b> <b>rings</b> are used to contain the yarn-loop, by reducing the yarn tension and decreasing the balloon flutter instability. Flutter instability here refers to the uncontrolled changes in a ballooning yarn under dynamic forces, including the air drag. Due to the significant variation in the length and radius of the balloon during the bobbin filling process, the optimal location for the balloon <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> is not easily determined. In order to address this difficulty, this study investigates the variation in the radius of a free balloon and examines the effect of balloon <b>control</b> <b>rings</b> of various diameters at different locations on yarn tension and balloon flutter stability. The results indicate that the maximum radius of a free balloon and its corresponding position depend not only on the yarn-length to balloon-height ratio, but also on yarn type and count. A <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> of suitable radius and position can significantly reduce yarn tension and decrease flutter instability of free single-loop balloons.

40|$|Piston ring {{friction}} losses account for approximately 20 % {{of the total}} mechanical losses in modern internal combustion engines. A reduction in piston ring friction would therefore result in higher efficiency, lower fuel consumption and reduced emissions. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop low-friction piston ring designs to improve engine efficiency, without adversely affecting oil consumption, blowby, wear, or cost. These are desirable objectives for today's engine manufacturers as they strive to improve engine performance while trying to meet increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Using an existing piston ring friction and lubrication model, the main contributors to friction in modern internal combustion engines were identified as the top ring around top dead center of the compression/expansion strokes and the <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> throughout the engine cycle. Model predictions indicated that the top ring friction could be reduced by implementing a skewed barrel profile design or an upward piston groove tilt design, and <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> friction could be reduced by decreasing ring tension. An increase in groove wear was predicted to occur with the upward piston groove tilt design, which could be eliminated by the introduction of a positive static twist on the top ring. An increase in oil consumption was predicted to occur with the low-tension <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> design, which could be mitigated either by the introduction of a negative static twist on the second ring, or by the implementation of the skewed barrel top ring design. Model predictions indicated that by combining the low-friction designs, a reduction in piston ring pack friction of 30 - 35 % could be achieved, without an increase in blowby, wear, or oil consumption. (cont.) Experimental results conducted on a full-scale natural gas power generation engine supported the model predictions for the low-tension <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> design. The predicted reduction in piston ring friction would translate to a 0. 5 - 1 % increase in brake thermal efficiency, which would result in a significant improvement in fuel economy and a substantial reduction in emissions over the life of the engine. by Grant Smedley.

40|$|The recent {{worldwide}} {{quest to}} increase the fuel efficiency of internal combustion engines has led to great effects to reduce friction {{of many of the}} components in these engines. One area of major concern pertaining to this area is the friction of the piston/ring pack assembly. Because of the importance and necessity of this component to the internal combustion engine, any improvements can have relatively large implications for friction reduction. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate several key components of the piston/ring pack assembly and how they influence friction levels. Specifically, experimental friction trends related to the <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring,</b> piston skirt, liner surface and lubricant will be discussed. The Floating Liner Engine is used in this study in both the motored and fired configuration to isolate results from components and provide data for comparative analysis. The <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> (OCR) controls the supply of lubricating oil to the top two rings of the ring pack and has a significant contribution to friction of the system. This study investigates the two most prevalent types of OCR in the automotive market: the twin land <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> (TLOCR) and three piece <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> (TPOCR). The effect of changing the land width and spring tension on different liner surfaces for the TLOCR is investigated, and distinct trends are identified. A comparison is then done between the TLOCR and TPOCR on different liner surfaces. Results showed the TPOCR displayed different patterns of friction compared the TLOCR in certain cases. The piston skirt is also an important contributor of friction in the piston assembly. This thesis discusses the investigation into low friction coatings on the piston skirt. A brief study of piston skirt patterns is presented, with little gains being made by applying patterns the piston skirt coating. Next the roughness of the piston skirt coating is analyzed, and results show that reducing piston skirt roughness can have positive effects on friction reduction. Finally, an introductory study into the profile of the piston skirt is presented, with the outcome being that friction reduction is possible by optimizing the skirt profile. The final section of this thesis discusses the effects of lubricants pertaining to friction in the piston assembly. The effects of changing lubricant viscosity through both temperature and formulation are presented, as well as results from testing the effects of select anti-wear additives in the oil. The results identify new developments related to lubricant/additive effects on the liner surface, and how these effects can influence friction. by Zach Westerfield. Thesis: S.

Varying oil consumption rates and their effect on particulates were analyzed at selected operation conditions of the CARB 8 -mode test cycle. The three steady-state engine operating conditions tested were mode 4 (1200 RPM, 25 % load), mode 5 (1200 RPM, 100 % load), and mode 1 (1800 RPM, 100 % load).
