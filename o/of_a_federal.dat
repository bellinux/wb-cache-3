5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, for mainly {{patriotic}} reasons, the Australian Natives' Association helped establish the Federation League, a society {{dedicated to the}} creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> nation. Following a series of addresses by the future Prime Minister, Edmund Barton to large crowds, some 15 League branches were established in the towns along the southern border. One of these towns, Corowa, was the location for the first conference of the Australian Federation League in 1893. At this conference, Dr John Quick, a delegate from Bendigo, proposed a resolution calling for the colonial legislatures to pass an act providing for the election of representatives to a convention to develop a federal constitution. This {{has been seen as}} the turning point in the push for Federation. The momentum generated from this point lead to a series of conventions and elections and finally, the inauguration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> constitution on 1 January 1901.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war in Slovenia, the army still saw itself as the defender <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal,</b> {{communist}} Yugoslavia, rather than an instrument of Serbian nationalism. Its head, General Veljko Kadijević, the Yugoslav Minister of Defence and a committed communist, initially sought to forcibly keep Yugoslavia together and proclaimed the army's neutrality in the Serb-Croat conflict. The JNA leadership aimed to cut Croatia in two by seizing the Serb-inhabited inland regions, almost all of the Dalmatian coast and much of central and eastern Croatia. It aimed to force Croatia's political leadership to capitulate and renegotiate its membership of Yugoslavia. The JNA's leadership was not yet dominated by ethnic Serbs, and these early goals reflected the Yugoslav outlook of its multiethnic leadership. Kadijević was half-Croat and half-Serb, his deputy was a Slovene, the commander of JNA forces in the first phase of the battle was a Macedonian, and the head of the Yugoslav Air Force, which repeatedly bombed Vukovar during the battle, was a Croat.|$|E

5|$|Before {{establishing}} the party, Mike Nattrass {{had long been}} involved with Britain's Eurosceptic movement. In 1994, Nattrass joined the New Britain Party and unsuccessfully stood for the group in the Dudley West by-election of the same year. Alike most New Britain candidates, Nattrass was absorbed into and stood in Solihull for the single-issue Referendum Party at the 1997 general election. Led by James Goldsmith, this party's policy was for a referendum to be held on the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU), specifically {{as to whether the}} British population wanted to be part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> European state or whether they wanted the EU to revert to being a free-trade bloc without wider political functions. Nattrass subsequently joined the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and eventually rose to the positions of Party Chairman and Deputy Leader. As the UKIP candidate, he was elected as a representative for the West Midlands constituency in the 2004 European Parliament election, and was re-elected in 2009.|$|E
