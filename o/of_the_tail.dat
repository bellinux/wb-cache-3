40|$|<b>The</b> {{stability}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operation <b>of</b> a <b>tailing</b> dam {{is affected}} by reservoir water level, phreatic line, and mechanical parameters <b>of</b> tailings. <b>The</b> values <b>of</b> these factors are not a definite value in different situations. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phreatic line makes it a more complex issue to analyze <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tailing</b> dam. Additionally, {{it is very hard}} to give a definite limit to <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> <b>tailing</b> dam from security to failure.

5|$|The Cuban macaw had a red {{forehead}} fading {{to orange}} {{and then to}} yellow {{at the nape of}} the neck. It had white unfeathered areas around the eyes, and yellow irises. The face, chin, chest, abdomen and thighs were orange. The legs were brown. The upper back was brownish red with feathers scalloped with green. The rump, undertail feathers, and lower back were blue. The wing feathers were brown, red and purplish blue. The upper surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> was dark red fading to blue at the tip, and the under surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> was brownish red.

5|$|The abdomen is {{composed}} of five somites, all of which lack appendages except the last. The back-facing margins of these somites bear small spines and four or more larger spines.

In addition to stabilising the body while swimming, a quick flick <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> fan can rapidly propel the animal backwards, which may have functioned as a means of escaping predators like in modern shrimp. Traces of four fused segments are evident in the three faint lines dividing each lobe <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> fan. A long telson is present {{at the end of the}} body. Traces of a rounded stomach, small digestive glands, and an intestine that terminates into a tiny anal opening on the telson can also be observed in some specimens.|$|E

5|$|The {{difference}} between teleosts and other bony fish lies mainly in their jaw bones; teleosts have a movable premaxilla and corresponding modifications {{in the jaw}} musculature which {{make it possible for}} them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. This is of great advantage, enabling them to grab prey and draw it into the mouth. In more derived teleosts, the enlarged premaxilla is the main tooth-bearing bone, and the maxilla, which is attached to the lower jaw, acts as a lever, pushing and pulling the premaxilla as the mouth is opened and closed. Other bones further back in the mouth serve to grind and swallow food. Another difference is that the upper and lower lobes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> (caudal) fin are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, distinguishing this group from other fish in which the spine extends into the upper lobe <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> fin.|$|E
5|$|The {{most serious}} {{pathology}} discovered {{was in a}} series of five large tail vertebrae. The first two vertebrae showed only minor abnormalities {{with the exception of a}} large groove that extended along the left side of both bones. However, the next three vertebrae were completely fused together at many different points, forming a solid bony mass. There is no sign of any other vertebrae after the fifth in the series, indicating that the tail ended there prematurely. From the size of the last vertebrae, scientists judged that about ten vertebrae were lost. One explanation for this pathology is severe physical trauma resulting in the loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> tip, followed by osteomyelitis (infection) of the last remaining vertebrae. Alternatively, the infection may have come first and led to the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> becoming necrotic and falling off. This is the first example of tail truncation known in a non-avian theropod dinosaur.|$|E
5|$|The winter fur is dense, soft, silky and {{relatively}} long. For the northern foxes, the fur is very long, dense and fluffy, but is shorter, sparser and coarser in southern forms. Among northern foxes, the North American varieties generally have the silkiest guard hairs, while most Eurasian red foxes have coarser fur. There are three main colour morphs; red, silver/black and cross (see Mutations). In the typical red morph, their coats are generally bright reddish-rusty with yellowish tints. A stripe of weak, diffuse patterns of many brown-reddish-chestnut hairs occurs along the spine. Two additional stripes pass down the shoulder blades, which, {{together with the}} spinal stripe, form a cross. The lower back is often a mottled silvery colour. The flanks are lighter coloured than the back, while the chin, lower lips, throat and front of the chest are white. The remaining lower {{surface of the body}} is dark, brown or reddish. During lactation, the belly fur of vixens may turn brick red. The upper parts of the limbs are rusty reddish, while the paws are black. The frontal part of the face and upper neck is bright brownish-rusty red, while the upper lips are white. The backs of the ears are black or brownish-reddish, while the inner surface is whitish. The top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> is brownish-reddish, but lighter in colour than the back and flanks. The underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> is pale grey with a straw-coloured tint. A black spot, the location of the supracaudal gland, is usually present at the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail.</b> The tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> is white.|$|E

40|$|Highly-purified human {{fibronectin}} receptor (a heterodimer of {{two distinct}} subunits, alpha and beta) was studied using electron microscopy {{and a variety}} of preparative procedures.

5|$|Another {{interpretation}} is that megalodon bore a similarity to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) or the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus).

This build is common in other large aquatic animals, such as whales, tuna, and other sharks, in order to reduce drag while swimming.
