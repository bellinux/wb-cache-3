40|$|In this work, {{we study}} {{temperature}} drift behavior of thermally actuated high frequency single crystalline silicon resonators and demonstrate temperature compensation of such via {{a combination of}} N-type degenerate doping and adjustment of the <b>operating</b> <b>bias</b> current. Significant suppression of the large negative temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) for the resonators (- 40 ppm/ºC) has been demonstrated using phosphorous degenerate doping resulting in even slightly positive TCF {{for some of the}} devices. Furthermore, it is shown that the TCF for such resonators can be fine tuned by changing the <b>operating</b> <b>bias</b> current enabling very close to zero TCF to be realized. Temperature compensation results for several resonators with different frequencies ranging from 3 MHz to 60 MHz are presented. TCF as low as- 0. 05 ppm/ºC (- 50 ppb/ºC) has been demonstrated for an 8. 2 MHz resonator, which {{to the best of our}} knowledge is the lowest reported value for silicon-based micromechanical resonators...|$|E

Government policies that promote the existence of small less productive firms by levying taxes on large ones can generate big TFP and output losses. This is so as taxing large firms makes the aggregate demand for labor as well as the equilibrium wage be inefficiently low. In such a situation, unproductive entrepreneurs can afford to <b>operate,</b> <b>biasing</b> the size distribution of plants towards small production units.

40|$|When {{electronic}} components {{are to be}} used in systems destined for operation in the extraterrestrial environment, one must be concerned about the effects of the naturally occurring radiation in outer space. For example, power metal-oxide-semiconductor-field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) and power bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) are susceptible to a phenomenon called single-event burnout (SEB) which may result from bombardment by heavy ions originating from the nuclear reactions within the sun and other stars. SEB is a catastrophic failure mechanism initiated by the passage of a heavy ion through sensitive regions of the power MOSFET or power BJT. The main thrust of this dissertation is an analytical model describing the device-related aspects of the SEB mechanism. Physical device parameters such as doping concentrations, dimensions of various regions, and <b>operating</b> <b>bias</b> are related to SEB by the model. It is shown that the model predicts a decrease in the SEB susceptibility with a decrease in the internal base resistance (in the power BJT or parasitic BJT in the power MOSFET structure), a decrease in the <b>operating</b> <b>bias,</b> or an increase in the ambient device temperature. These findings are then qualitatively verified with experimental data...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{efficient}} procedure for determination of small-signal and noise behavior of microwave transistors for various bias conditions is proposed. An empirical transistor noise model {{based on an}} equivalent circuit (improvement of Pospieszalski’s noise model) is considered. Since {{it is necessary to}} extract values of the model equivalent circuit for each bias point (which requires the measured data acquiring and repeated time consuming extraction procedures), it is proposed to use an artificial neural network to model the bias dependence of the equivalent circuit parameters. In that way, it is necessary to acquire the measured data and extract the equivalent circuit parameters only for several <b>operating</b> <b>biases</b> used for the network training. Once the neural network is trained, the device small-signal scattering and noise parameters are easily obtained for an arbitrary bias point from the device operating range without changes in the model.

40|$|A large {{magnetoresistance}} {{effect is}} obtained at room-temperature by using p-i-n armchair-graphene-nanoribbon (GNR) heterostructures. The key advantage is the virtual elimination of thermal currents {{due to the}} presence of band gaps in the contacts. The current at B= 0 T is greatly decreased while the current at B> 0 T is relatively large due to the band-to-band tunneling effects, resulting in a high magnetoresistance ratio, even at room-temperature. Moreover, we explore the effects of edge-roughness, length, and width of GNR channels on device performance. An increase in edge-roughness and channel length enhances the magnetoresistance ratio while increased channel width can reduce the <b>operating</b> <b>bias.</b> Comment: [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. While {{there have}} been {{numerous}} reports of short-term transistor operation at 500 °C or above, these devices have previously not demonstrated sufficient long-term operational durability at 500 °C to be considered viable for most envisioned applications. This paper reports the development of SiC field effect transistors capable of long-term electrical operation at 500 °C. A 6 H-SiC MESFET was packaged and subjected to continuous electrical operation while residing in a 500 °C oven in oxidizing air atmosphere for over 2400 hours. The transistor gain, saturation current (IDSS), and on-resistance (RDS) changed by less than 20 % from initial values throughout the duration of the biased 500 °C test. Another high-temperature packaged 6 H-SiC MESFET was employed to form a simple one-stage high-temperature low-frequency voltage amplifier. This single-stage common-source amplifier demonstrated stable continuous electrical operation (negligible changes to gain and <b>operating</b> <b>biases)</b> for over 600 hours while residing in a 500 °C air ambient oven. In both cases, increased leakage from annealing of the Schottky gate-to-channel diode was the dominant transistor degradation mechanism that limited the duration of 500 °C electrical operation...|$|R

40|$|Electrolyte-gated organic {{transistors}} offer low bias operation {{facilitated by}} direct contact of the transistor channel with an electrolyte. Their operation mode is generally {{defined by the}} dimensionality of charge transport, where a field-effect transistor allows for electrostatic charge accumulation at the electrolyte/semiconductor interface, whereas an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) facilitates penetration of ions into {{the bulk of the}} channel, considered a slow process, leading to volumetric doping and electronic transport. Conducting polymer OECTs allow for fast switching and high currents through incorporation of excess, hygroscopic ionic phases, but operate in depletion mode. Here, we show that the use of glycolated side chains on a thiophene backbone can result in accumulation mode OECTs with high currents, transconductance, and sharp subthreshold switching, while maintaining fast switching speeds. Compared with alkylated analogs of the same backbone, the triethylene glycol side chains shift the mode of operation of aqueous electrolyte-gated transistors from interfacial to bulk doping/transport and show complete and reversible electrochromism and high volumetric capacitance at low <b>operating</b> <b>biases.</b> We propose that the glycol side chains facilitate hydration and ion penetration, without compromising electronic mobility, and suggest that this synthetic approach can be used to guide the design of organic mixed conductors...|$|R

30|$|To {{characterize}} {{an organic}} floating-gate memory, many parameters are used, {{such as the}} operating voltage, on/off ratio, memory window, program/erase speed, retention time, and endurance. First, the operating voltage of OFET memory is mainly determined by the minimum bias during programing and erasing processes to achieve a sufficient memory window and on/off current ratio. It {{is expected to be}} below 10  V because of the desire for low power consumption and to increase the reliability of the memory. Notably, organic floating-gate memory has a relatively high operation voltage above 50  V, since those reports were mostly focused on conceptual approaches and used conventional silicon dioxide or low permittivity (k) polymer gate dielectric layers with sufficient thickness.
