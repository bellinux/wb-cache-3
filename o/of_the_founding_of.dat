5|$|Within a {{few months}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>founding</b> <b>of</b> the Swan River Colony in June 1829 by free-settlers, {{there was a need}} for a prison to incarcerate criminals.

This arrangement was quite arduous for the sheriff, who spent much of his time rowing a small boat, either to transfer prisoners or bring over their meals. It was not until September 1830 that work started on a new prison at the west end of High Street: the twelve-sided Round House on Arthur Head.|$|E
