5|$|Iniki's {{high winds}} also downed 26.5% of the island's {{transmission}} poles, 37% of its distribution poles, and 35% of its 800mile (1300km) distribution wire system. The entire island lacked electricity and television service {{for an extended}} period of time. Electric companies restored only 20% of the island's power service within four weeks of Iniki, while other areas were without power for up to three months. Also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector. Though much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> cane was already harvested, what was left was severely damaged. The winds destroyed tender tropical plants like bananas and papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut trees.|$|E
5|$|Polyols, {{compounds}} containing {{more than}} one alcohol functional group, generally interact with cupric salts. For example, copper salts are used to test for reducing sugars. Specifically, using Benedict's reagent and Fehling's solution the presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> is signaled by a color change from blue Cu(II) to reddish copper(I) oxide. Schweizer's reagent and related complexes with ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose. Amino acids form very stable chelate complexes with copper(II). Many wet-chemical tests for copper ions exist, one involving potassium ferrocyanide, which gives a brown precipitate with copper(II) salts.|$|E

5|$|A band of ranch land on Mauna Kea's lower slopes was {{formerly}} Acacia koa – Metrosideros polymorpha (koa-ōhia) forest. Its destruction {{was driven by}} an influx of European and American settlers in the early 19th century, as extensive logging during the 1830s provided lumber for new homes. Vast swathes of the forest were burned and cleared for sugarcane plantations. Most of the houses on the island were built of koa, and {{those parts of the}} forest that survived became a source for firewood to power boilers on the sugarcane plantations and to heat homes. The once vast forest had almost disappeared by 1880, and by 1900 logging interests had shifted to Kona and the island of Maui. With the collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> industry in the 1990s, much of this land lies fallow but portions are used for cattle grazing, small-scale farming and the cultivation of eucalyptus for wood pulp.|$|E
5|$|Boxing was {{introduced}} and practiced in a clandestine manner in Puerto Rico while the archipelago {{was still a}} Spanish colony. Fights were organized in haciendas among the workers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> and coffee plantations, and the objective {{was to determine the}} best fighter among the employees. Following the culmination of the Puerto Rican Campaign and Spanish–American War, American soldiers who were stationed in the main island practiced the sport. During World War I, a championship known as Campeonato Las Casas was held as training for military personnel. Nero Chen, the first Puerto Rican boxer to gain recognition, began his career in these tournaments. The Combat Maneuver Training Center followed this example and organized boxing activities, which they named Los Campeones del Campamento. These were received with enthusiasm by the young recruits. Most of these events were celebrated without restriction due to military jurisdictional limits, although prohibitions were put in place for the civilian population. Illegal matches were organized on the rooftops of residences in Old San Juan, empty terrain's in El Condado and in hippodromes.|$|E
5|$|Bute died in 1900 and his widow, the Marchioness, {{was given}} a life {{interest}} in Castell Coch; during her mourning, she and her daughter, Lady Margaret Crichton-Stuart, occupied the castle and made occasional visits thereafter. Production in the castle vineyards ceased during the First World War due to the shortages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> needed for the fermentation process, and in 1920 the vineyards were uprooted. John, the 4th Marquess, acquired the castle in 1932 but made little use of it. He also began to reduce the family's investments in South Wales. The coal trade had declined after 1918 and industry had suffered during the depression of the 1920s; by 1938, {{the great majority of}} the family interests, including the coal mines and docks, had been sold off or nationalised.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this work, we {{aimed at}} {{studying}} formulation {{and design of}} powders by modified wet compression method. In order to focus only on <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquid binder in <b>the</b> mechanical cohesion <b>of</b> compacts, glass beads were used as model particles {{because they do not}} deform or fragment at the compression pressure used (35 kN). The three different binders studied were sugars: fructose, glucose and saccharose, used as solutions. Therefore, compacts were stored at controlled conditions until reaching water activity equilibrium at a fixed temperature of 25 degrees C. Then, <b>the</b> tensile strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compacts was determined using a Brazilian test. It was found to be dependent on the water activity. Critical values of Aw were measured (A(w) = 0. 23 for the fructose, A(w) = 0. 33 for the glucose, and A(w) = 0. 44 for the saccharose), beyond which the glass transition phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sugars</b> appeared, and resulted in a sharp drop in <b>the</b> mechanical strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compacts. <b>The</b> classification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sugars</b> according to their respective glass transition temperature (Tg(fructose) < Tg(glucose), < Tg(saccharose)) permitted to confirm <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glass transition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sugars</b> as binders in <b>the</b> mechanical resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compacts. Finally, sorption isotherms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sugars</b> coupled to <b>the</b> tensile strength results showed that the main parameter for predicting mechanical strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compact was <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> sorbed water by <b>the</b> <b>sugar,</b> regardless to his nature...|$|R

5|$|Near its {{landfall}} location, Charley destroyed 290 of the 300houses in the village, while over 70,000homes in Havana {{were either}} damaged or destroyed. Numerous hotels reported damage, potentially impacting the important tourism {{industry in the}} country. Agricultural damage was heavy, with the hurricane damaging more than 3,000 agricultural institutions. Citrus officials estimated a loss of 15,000metric tons of grapefruit on the Isle of Youth, while strong winds ruined 66,000metric tons of citrus trees in the Havana area. Charley also destroyed around 57,000acres (230km²) of fruit trees in the Havana area. Approximately 95% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> cane, bean, and banana crops were affected in Cuban territory. In all, Charley was directly responsible for four deaths in Cuba, and was responsible for $923million in property damage, primarily from agricultural losses.|$|E

5|$|This system {{developed}} as a tropical depression just offshore {{the west coast of}} Africa on September6. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm later that day, shortly before passing south of the Cape Verde Islands. Further intensification was slow and halted by late on September7. However, about 48hours later, the storm resumed strengthening and became a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Still moving westward, the system reached Category4 intensity before striking Guadeloupe on September12. There, the storm brought 1,200deaths and extensive damage, including the destruction of approximately 85%–95% of banana crops, the severe damage dealt to 70%–80% of tree crops, and the roughly 40% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> cane crops ruined.

5|$|Another {{commodity}} {{that was}} a prominent source of trade was the production of sugar from the crop sugar cane. The original habitat of sugar was in India, where it was taken and planted in various islands. Once reaching {{to the people of}} the Iberian Peninsula, it was further migrated across the Atlantic Ocean. In the 16th century, the first plantations of sugar were started in the New World, marking the last great stage of migration of the cane to the West. Because of the conflict of transporting sugar in its raw form, sugar was not associated with commerce until the act of refining it came into play; this act became the center for industry. Venice was the center for refining during the Middle Ages, therefore making them the chief traders of sugar. Although, the Spanish and Portuguese held the monopolies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> cane fields in America, they were being supplied by Venice. In the 17th century, England dominated Venice and became the center for refining and cultivating sugar; this leadership was maintained until the rise of French industry. Sugar throughout the 17th century was still considered a luxury until the latter half of the 17th century when the sugar was being produced in mass quantities making it available to the mass of the English people. This turn of events made the sugar a commodity, because the crop was not being used in only special occasion, but in all daily meals.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} climates {{there is}} a sudden movement of sap {{at the end of}} the winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining 10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The sap is harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the trees and collecting the liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. One litre of maple syrup is obtained from every forty litres of sap and has a sugar content of exactly 66%. Similarly in northern Europe the spring rise in the sap of the silver birch (Betula pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented into an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, the sap of the sweet birch (Betula lenta) is made into a syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch sap is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required to make one litre of birch syrup.|$|E
5|$|The freeway {{enters the}} Salt Lake Valley {{on the former}} {{alignment}} of North Temple Street until it passes the Salt Lake City International Airport, where the freeway veers slightly south and leaves the North Temple Street corridor which leads to Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City. The Green Line of the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) TRAX system briefly parallels I-80 before traveling {{down the center of}} North Temple Street. I-80 becomes concurrent with I-15 after interchanges with SR-58 and 600South and continues south for about , passing along the western and southern edges of downtown Salt Lake City. The southern interchange with I-15, which also includes SR-201 (21st South Freeway) and marks the end of the concurrency, is known as the Spaghetti Bowl,. In the southwestern corner of the Spaghetti Bowl is another portion of the UTA TRAX Green Line as it travels towards West Valley City. After separating from I-15, the freeway continues easterly through South Salt Lake, loosely following an alignment just south of 2100South and the UTA S Line streetcar through the Sugar House neighborhood and past Sugar House Parkonce the home <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sugar</b> House Prison towards the clockwise terminus of the I-215 270° belt route around Salt Lake. It continues through Parley's Canyon, where the freeway joins the historical route of the Lincoln Highway.

5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The beans are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sugar</b> without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E

40|$|Natural {{cytotoxic}} (NC) {{and natural}} killer (NK) cells have been defined by {{their ability to}} lyse certain solid or lymphoid tumor targets in vitro, without prior sensitization. Our present studies describe an attempt to characterize the structures involved in the effector-target recognition leading to tumor cell lysis. Addition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monosaccharide D-mannose to the NC cell assay significantly blocked cytotoxicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fibrosarcoma Meth A target by the effector cells at 50 mM and lower concentrations. D-Galactose showed blocking activity in one of five experiments, only at 50 mM. L-Fucose, D-glucose, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine did not affect NC cell cytotoxicity at similar concentrations. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sugars</b> tested inhibited NK cell lysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lymphoma YAC-I target. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sugars</b> affected killing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> appropriate target by allosensitized cytotoxic T lymphocytes. <b>The</b> blocking <b>of</b> NC-mediated cytotoxicity was not due to a direct toxic action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sugars</b> on <b>the</b> effector cells. These findings suggest that, in the NC system, recognition involves lectin-like structures with a specificity for D-mannose (or D-galactose, or both), whereas, in the NK system, such lectin-like structures are less restricted. Such structures appear not {{to be involved in}} the specific cytotoxicity mediated by T cells...|$|R
