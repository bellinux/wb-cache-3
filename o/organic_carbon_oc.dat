50|$|Equilibrium {{partitioning}} Sediment Benchmarks (ESBs) are {{a type of}} Sediment Quality Guideline (SQG) {{derived by}} the USEPA {{for the protection of}} benthic organisms. ESBs are based on the bioavailable concentration of contaminants in sediments rather than the dry-weight concentration. It has been demonstrated that sediment concentrations on a dry-weight basis often do not predict biological effects. Interstitial water concentrations, however, predict biological effects much better. This is true because the chemical present in the interstitial water (or pore water) is the uncomplexed/free phase of the chemical that is bioavailable and toxic to benthic organisms. Other phases of the chemical are bound to sediment particles like <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> (<b>OC)</b> or acid volatile sulfides (AVS) and are not bioavailable. Thus the interstitial water concentration is important to consider for effects to benthic organisms.|$|E

Since many atmospheric organic compounds have different optical properties, {{it is difficult to}} determine the optical properties of OC accurately. In particular, hygroscopicity and light absorption of OC are important factors in understanding the aerosol optical properties. In this study, the sensitivity of <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> (<b>OC)</b> to aerosol optical properties was tested. Both the refractive index and the hygroscopicity of OC were considered. Based on the filter-based monthly averaged sampling measurement data from an intensive observation site in Seoul, Korea, the contribution of each component on the aerosol optical properties was estimated. The aerosol optical properties were simulated by combining the aerosol dynamic model for polydispersed aerosols with an optical properties model based on Mie code. The optical properties were compared with the AERONET Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) measurement data. In order to estimate the contribution of the light absorption and hygroscopicity of <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> (<b>OC)</b> on the optical properties of the aerosols, a sensitivity test was conducted with different imaginary refractive indices and OC hygroscopic growth factors. The results show that mass absorption efficiency can be fitted linearly as the imaginary refractive index increases. This means that one can estimate the mass absorption efficiency of OC as a function of the imaginary refractive index. The results also show that mass extinction and absorption efficiency decrease as the hygroscopic factor of OC increases because of the increase in water content. The contribution of OC to the mass extinction efficiency, however, depends on the chemical composition of other aerosol mixtures and hence, more comprehensive studies are required in this regard...|$|E

The agreement between certified and measured results suggested that SOC could be completely recovered by using wet digestion under tested method described (except Walkley Black midified method). <b>Organic</b> <b>carbon</b> contents from the Walkley Black modified method were higher in all investigated samples than those obtained by the other titrimetric methods. The most significant increase is observed in the standards 3, 6 and 7, i. e. the standards with the highest content of organic matter. The Tube digestion method and Tjurin method (1500 C with phosphoric acid added before titration) are very effective for soil samples up to 2 % of <b>organic</b> <b>carbon.</b> The Tube digestion method for <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> determination seem to be the most suitable methods, for soil samples, compost and sludge with high organic matter content.

Field sampling results indicated that PM 2. 5 concentrations over sea were generally higher than those at the offshore islands, while the PM 2. 5 concentrations in the daytime were commonly higher than those at nighttime. Moreover, the concentrations of PM 2. 5 were generally {{higher than those of}} coarse particles (PM 2. 5 – 10) with an exception of the winter cruise in 2014. Moreover, sea salts accounted for 6. 5 – 11. 1  % and 11. 0 – 13. 5  % of PM 2. 5 at the offshore islands and over sea, respectively. The contributions of non-sea salt-water soluble ions (nss-WSI) to PM 2. 5 at the offshore islands were obviously higher than those over sea, while the contributions of ss-WSI for PM 2. 5 at the offshore islands were much lower than those over sea during the cruise sampling campaigns. Anthropogenic metallic elements including Zn, Mn, Pb, Cr, and Ni had higher concentrations over sea than those at the offshore islands, suggesting that PM 2. 5 was not only influenced by marine aerosols but also by anthropogenic particles originated from human activities such as industrial processing, fuel burning, and vehicular and shipping exhausts. Higher mass ratios of Ni/Al and Ni/Fe over sea than those at the offshore islands suggested that shipping emissions had higher influences on marine fine particles than crustal dusts in open sea while compared to those at the offshore islands.

Average concentrations of 2. 2 μgCm- 3 and 6. 8 μgCm- 3 were observed, for EC and OC, respectively. The combined contribution of carbonaceous compounds (EC plus organic matter) to PM 10 was calculated at 26 %. The seasonal variability of EC was limited, while OC mean {{concentrations were}} significantly higher (by 23 %), during the warm months (May-August). The weekly variation followed a different pattern, with the weekend decrease of EC levels (25 %) being more pronounced than of OC (14 %). EC produced a bimodal diurnal cycle, with the morning rush hour traffic mode prevailing. The OC mean circadian variation displayed those peaks as well. However, midday-to-afternoon presence of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) was strongly indicated. The conditional probability function {{was used to assess}} the impact of wind direction. High EC, OC levels were linked to southern flows, which during summer are mainly related to the appearance of sea breeze circulation. The temporal variation of EC, OC and their correlation patterns with primary and secondary gaseous pollutants, suggested that, although primary emissions affected both fractions, SOA formation is an important factor to be accounted for, especially during the photochemical season.

Ice nucleation was found to be most efficient for uncoated soot of low <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> content (~ 5 % <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> content) where deposition freezing occurred at an ice saturation ratio Sice ~ 1. 22 at a temperature T = 226. 6 K with 25 % of the test soot becoming active as ice nuclei. Propane flame soot of higher <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> content (~ 30 % and ~ 70 % <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> content) showed significantly lower ice nucleation efficiency (an activated fraction of the order of a few percent in the experiments) than the low <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> content soot, with water saturation being required for freezing to occur.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to assess the}} influence of soil organic amendments on the sorption properties of the fungicide thiram. The organic amendments studied were organic household compost (COM), sewage sludge from municipal water treatment facilities (SLU) and farmyard manure (FYM), which were compared to mineral fertilizer application (MIN). Sorption-desorption experiments were performed using the batch method and the results indicated that the adsorption isotherms were non-linear and were found to conform to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model, suggesting multilayer adsorption and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions after the saturation of the surface layer. In general, distribution coefficient values, K(D), are dependent on, but not proportional to, the initial concentration of thiram. For a fixed thiram initial concentration, a significant correlation (r(2) > 0. 851 : p < 0. 001) between K(D) values and the soil <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> content (<b>OC)</b> was observed. The highest value of K(D) was observed for the soil amended with compost, which is the one with the highest <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> content. K(D) values were divided by the soil <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> contents in order to obtain <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> partition coefficients K(oc). Comparing Koc means from 3 (initial concentrations) x 4 (soil organic matter compositions) x 3 (replicates) factorial ANOVA allow us to conclude that there is a significant but not proportional influence of the initial concentration of thiram on those values, but changes in the soil organic matter composition, associated to different soil amendments, have no significant influence on adsorption of thiram. To evaluate the reversibility of thiram adsorption, two consecutive desorption cycles were performed with CaCI(2) 0. 01 mol L(- 1). The desorption K(D) values were consistently higher (approximately twice) than those for adsorption at the same equilibrium concentrations for all soil samples supporting the existence of hysteresis in the adsorption-desorption behavior of thiram. Despite the fact that the adsorption K(D) values were proportionally increased with increasing total <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> content, {{this was not the case}} for the desorption K(D) values.
