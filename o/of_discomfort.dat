5|$|As {{successful}} self-determination movements {{spread throughout}} Africa after World War II, many Mozambicans became progressively nationalistic in outlook, and increasingly {{frustrated by the}} nation's continued subservience to foreign rule. For the other side, many enculturated indigenous Africans who were fully integrated into the Portugal-ruled social organization of Portuguese Mozambique, in particular those from the urban centres, reacted to the independentist claims with a mixture <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> and suspicion. The ethnic Portuguese of the territory, which included most of the ruling authorities, responded with increased military presence and fast-paced development projects.|$|E
5|$|In their 2002 book Myofascial Pain and Fibromyalgia: Trigger Point Management authors {{orthopedic}} surgeon Edward S.

They wrote that continued use of the Magic Wand on myofascial trigger points or tense areas of muscle could result in decreasing the amount <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> felt by patients. Rachlin and Rachlin suggested that such treatment {{could be done in}} one's residence outside of a clinical setting.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Greek slaves {{was a constant}} source <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> for free Greeks. The enslavement of cities was also a controversial practice. Some generals refused, such as the Spartans Agesilaus II and Callicratidas. Some cities passed accords to forbid the practice: {{in the middle of}} the 3rd century BC, Miletus agreed not to reduce any free Knossian to slavery, and vice versa. Conversely, the emancipation by ransom of a city that had been entirely reduced to slavery carried great prestige: Cassander, in 316 BC, restored Thebes. Before him, Philip II of Macedon enslaved and then emancipated Stageira.|$|E

40|$|A {{test program}} to {{determine}} the total discomfort associated with vehicle vibration is described. The program utilizes a three-degree-of-freedom vibration simulator {{to determine the}} effects of multifrequency and multiaxis vibration inputs. The approach to multifrequency vibration includes a separate consideration <b>of</b> the <b>discomfort</b> associated with each frequency component or band of the total spectrum and a subsequent empirical weighting <b>of</b> the <b>discomfort</b> components <b>of</b> these frequency bands when in various random combinations. The results are in the form <b>of</b> equal <b>discomfort</b> curves that specify the discomfort associated with discrete frequencies between 1 and 30 Hz and different acceleration levels. These results provide detailed information <b>of</b> the human <b>discomfort</b> response to increases in acceleration level for each frequency investigated. More importantly, the results provide a method for adding the discomfort associated with separate frequencies to give a total typification <b>of</b> the <b>discomfort</b> <b>of</b> a random spectrum of vibration...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} for an experimental study directed to derive equal vibration discomfort curves, {{to determine the}} influence of vibration masking in order to account for the total <b>discomfort</b> <b>of</b> any random vibration, and to develop a scale <b>of</b> total vibration <b>discomfort</b> in the case of human response to whole-body vertical vibration. Discomfort is referred to as a subjective discomfort associated with the acceleration level of a particular frequency band. It is shown that passenger discomfort to whole-body vibration increases linearly with acceleration level for each frequency. Empirical data provide a mechanism for determining the degree of masking (or summation) <b>of</b> the <b>discomfort</b> <b>of</b> multiple frequency vibration. A scale for the prediction <b>of</b> passenger <b>discomfort</b> is developed...|$|R
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which would immediately succumb to the cold and drown in water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs <b>of</b> <b>discomfort.</b> This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: Many review {{articles}} {{report the}} safety and lack of serious side-effects associated with the histamine challenge. Even though methacholine and hypertonic saline are more commonly used to measure airway responsiveness, histamine challenges are used in many countries around the world. Levels <b>of</b> subjects <b>discomfort</b> after a challenge have not been quantified. This study quantified the incidence, severity and duration <b>of</b> subject <b>discomfort</b> after histamine challenge. Methods: Ninety-nine subjects were recruited in an Australian multi-centre population-based study of the genetic epidemiology of asthma. Subjects completed a histamine challenge with final cumulative dose 3. 2 μmol. Immediately, and 10 min, after challenge subjects rated their discomfort for cough, headache, throat irritation, hoarse voice and flushed. Research personnel also reported their perception <b>of</b> subject <b>discomfort.</b> Results: Subjects and research personnel reported a small degree <b>of</b> subject <b>discomfort</b> for all symptoms immediately after the histamine challenge. Overall, median symptom scores were less than 1. 5 out <b>of</b> 10. <b>Discomfort</b> scores improved 10 min after challenge and cough, throat irritation and flushed improved significantly. Conclusions: This study confirms the tolerability of the histamine challenge...|$|R

25|$|The {{individual}} {{engages in}} the behavior because it produces a decrease in aversive stimulation. Put another way, something aversive is occurring in some location on the organism's body, and engaging {{in the behavior}} decreases the level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort.</b> For example, a child bangs {{his head against the}} wall to decrease the pain experienced from a toothache. Another example includes a child scratching his arm to decrease the level of itchiness experienced from a bug bite. Common forms of aversive stimulation abated by engaging in specific behaviors include sinus pain, itching, hunger, etc.|$|E
25|$|Suggested by Leon Festinger, {{cognitive}} dissonance occurs {{when an individual}} experiences some degree <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> resulting from an inconsistency between two cognitions: {{their views on the}} world around them, and their own personal feelings and actions. For example, a consumer may seek to reassure themselves regarding a purchase, feeling that another decision may have been preferable. Their feeling that another purchase would have been preferable is inconsistent with their action of purchasing the item. The difference between their feelings and beliefs causes dissonance, so they seek to reassure themselves.|$|E
25|$|Both EMG and NCS {{involve some}} measure <b>of</b> <b>discomfort.</b> EMG {{involves}} the use of a tiny needle that is inserted into specific muscles to test the associated muscle and nerve function. Both EMG & NCS involve very mild shocks that in normal patients are comparable to a rubber band snapping on the skin. Although these tests can be very useful in CRPS, thorough informed consent needs to be obtained prior to the procedure, particularly in patients experiencing severe allodynia. In spite of the utility of the test, these patients may wish to decline the procedure in order to avoid discomfort.|$|E

Tendinitis and bursitis also cause pain when the arm is lifted {{away from the body}} or overhead. If tendinitis involves the biceps tendon (the tendon located in front of the shoulder that helps bend the elbow and turn the forearm), pain will occur in the front or side of the shoulder and may travel down to the elbow and forearm. Pain may also occur when the arm is forcefully pushed upward overhead.|$|E
25|$|The owners closely {{watch the}} cricket's {{behavior}} for signs <b>of</b> <b>discomfort,</b> {{and adjust the}} diet to bring the fighters into shape. The crickets are mated with females before the fight, as the Chinese believe that, unlike other beings, male crickets become more aggressive after having sex. In Laufer's time the fighters were sorted in three weight classes; present-day Shanghai aficionados have a system of nine classes from 0.51 to 0.74grams. Both sides in a fight should {{belong to the same}} class, thus before the fight the crickets are weighed on high-precision scales (huang). The units of cricket weight, zun and dian, are not used anywhere else.|$|E

25|$|Riis's {{concern for}} the poor and {{destitute}} often caused people to assume he disliked the rich. However, Riis showed no sign <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> among the affluent, often asking them for their support. Although seldom involved with party politics, Riis was sufficiently disgusted by the corruption of Tammany Hall to change from being an endorser of the Democratic Party to endorse the Republican Party. The period just before the Spanish–American War was difficult for Riis. He was approached by liberals who suspected that protests of alleged Spanish mistreatment of the Cubans was merely a ruse intended to provide a pretext for US expansionism; perhaps to avoid offending his friend Roosevelt, Riis refused the offer of good payment to investigate this and made nationalist statements.|$|E
25|$|A {{popular belief}} is that MSG can cause {{headaches}} and other feelings <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> but double-blind tests have found {{no evidence to support}} this. MSG has been used for more than 100 years to season food, with a number of studies conducted on its safety. Consumption and manufacture of high-salt and high-glutamate foods, which contain both sodium and glutamate, stretch back far longer, with evidence of cheese manufacture as early as 5,500 BC. International and national bodies governing food additives currently consider MSG safe for human consumption as a flavor enhancer. Under normal conditions, humans can metabolize relatively large quantities of glutamate, which is naturally produced in the gut in the course of protein hydrolysis. The median lethal dose (LD50) is between 15 and 18 g/kg body weight in rats and mice, respectively, five times greater than the LD50 of salt (3 g/kg in rats). The use of MSG as a food additive and the natural level of glutamic acid in foods are not toxicological concerns in humans.|$|E
