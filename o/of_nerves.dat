5|$|Apical {{periodontitis}} is acute {{or chronic}} inflammation around {{the apex of}} a tooth caused by an immune response to bacteria within an infected pulp. It does not occur because of pulp necrosis, meaning that a tooth that tests as if it's alive (vital) may cause apical periodontitis, and a pulp which has become non-vital due to a sterile, non-infectious processes (such as trauma) may not cause any apical periodontitis. Bacterial cytotoxins reach the region around {{the roots of the}} tooth via the apical foramina and lateral canals, causing vasodilation, sensitization <b>of</b> <b>nerves,</b> osteolysis (bone resorption) and potentially abscess or cyst formation.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December three {{prisoners in}} Armagh Women's Prison joined the strike, {{including}} Mairéad Farrell, {{followed by a}} short-lived hunger strike by several dozen more prisoners in HM Prison Maze. In a war <b>of</b> <b>nerves</b> between the IRA leadership and the British government, with McKenna lapsing {{in and out of}} a coma and on the brink of death, the government appeared to concede the essence of the prisoners' five demands with a thirty-page document detailing a proposed settlement. With the document in transit to Belfast, Hughes took the decision to save McKenna's life and end the strike after 53 days on 18 December.|$|E
5|$|Pituitary {{apoplexy}} or pituitary tumor apoplexy is bleeding into or impaired {{blood supply}} of the pituitary gland {{at the base of}} the brain. This usually occurs in the presence of a tumor of the pituitary, although in 80% of cases this has not been diagnosed previously. The most common initial symptom is a sudden headache, often associated with a rapidly worsening visual field defect or double vision caused by compression <b>of</b> <b>nerves</b> surrounding the gland. This is followed in many cases by acute symptoms caused by lack of secretion of essential hormones, predominantly adrenal insufficiency.|$|E
50|$|Imaging studies, such as {{ultrasound}} or MRI, {{may reveal}} anatomic abnormalities or masses {{responsible for the}} impingement. Additionally, imaging may show secondary signs <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> damage that further confirm the diagnosis of impingement. Signs <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> damage include flattening <b>of</b> the <b>nerve,</b> swelling <b>of</b> the <b>nerve</b> proximal to site of injury, abnormal appearance <b>of</b> <b>nerve,</b> or characteristic changes to the muscles innervated by the nerve.|$|R

5|$|The heart {{receives}} nerve {{signals from}} the vagus nerve and from nerves arising from the sympathetic trunk. These nerves act to influence, but not control, the heart rate. Sympathetic nerves also influence the force of heart contraction. Signals that travel along these nerves arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongata. The vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system acts to decrease the heart rate, and nerves from the sympathetic trunk act to increase the heart rate. These nerves form a network <b>of</b> <b>nerves</b> that lies over the heart called the cardiac plexus.|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to the {{pituitary}} lies {{a part of}} {{the skull}} base known as the cavernous sinus. This contains a number <b>of</b> <b>nerves</b> that control the eye muscles. 70% of people with pituitary apoplexy experience double vision due to compression of one of the nerves. In half of these cases, the oculomotor nerve (the third cranial nerve), which controls a number of eye muscles, is affected. This leads to diagonal double vision and a dilated pupil. The fourth (trochlear) and sixth (abducens) cranial nerves are located in the same compartment and can cause diagonal or horizontal double vision, respectively. The oculomotor nerve is predominantly affected as it lies closest to the pituitary. The cavernous sinus also contains the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain; occasionally, compression of the artery can lead to one-sided weakness and other symptoms of stroke.|$|E
5|$|The cephalic {{molluscs}} {{have two}} pairs of main nerve cords organized around a number of paired ganglia, the visceral cords serving the internal organs and the pedal ones serving the foot. Most pairs of corresponding ganglia {{on both sides of}} the body are linked by commissures (relatively large bundles <b>of</b> <b>nerves).</b> The ganglia above the gut are the cerebral, the pleural, and the visceral, which are located above the esophagus (gullet). The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are below the esophagus and their commissure and connectives to the cerebral and pleural ganglia surround the esophagus in a circumesophageal nerve ring or nerve collar.|$|E

50|$|The {{severity}} of brachial plexus injury {{is determined by}} the type <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> damage. There are several different classification systems for grading the severity <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> and brachial plexus injuries. Most systems attempt to correlate the degree of injury with symptoms, pathology and prognosis. Seddon's classification, devised in 1943, continues to be used, and is based on three main types <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> fiber injury, and whether there is continuity <b>of</b> the <b>nerve.</b>|$|R
30|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to compare the {{efficacy}} <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> regeneration between autograft and two different types <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> conduits, Nerbridge™ and NeuraGen®, using DTI, electrodiagnostic testing, limb function, and histopathologic measurements.|$|R
5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, a group <b>of</b> <b>nerves</b> {{that arise from}} the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. The facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of facial expression on one or both sides of the face.|$|E

25|$|Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) is a {{heterogeneous}} inherited disorder <b>of</b> <b>nerves</b> (neuropathy) that {{is characterized by}} loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation, predominantly in the feet and legs {{but also in the}} hands and arms in the advanced stages of disease.

25|$|Synkinesis is {{the result}} from miswiring <b>of</b> <b>nerves</b> after trauma. This result is {{manifested}} through involuntary muscular movements accompanying voluntary movements. For example, voluntary smiling will induce an involuntary contraction of the eye muscles causing the eye to squint when smiling. Most commonly involved are facial muscles and the extraocular muscles, rarely the hands are performing mirror movements.|$|E

The large intestine of the horse is a complex system where most digestion takes place, and comprises the cecum, the colon, and the rectum.

Samples of affected tissue show a lack <b>of</b> <b>nerves</b> that allow the intestine to move material through the digestive system, a condition called intestinal agangliosis.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, David L.

25|$|Surgery, {{such as the}} denervation of {{selected}} muscles, may also provide some relief; however, the destruction <b>of</b> <b>nerves</b> in the limbs or brain is not reversible and should be considered only in the most extreme cases.

DBS as treatment for medication-refractory dystonia, on the other hand, may increase the risk of suicide in patients. However, reference data of patients without DBS therapy are lacking.|$|E

25|$|The lumbar plexus {{block is}} an {{advanced}} technique indicated for hip, anterior thigh, and knee surgery. The lumbar plexus is composed <b>of</b> <b>nerves</b> originating from L1 to L4 spinal roots {{such as the}} iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, femoral, and obturator nerves. Since the plexus is located deep, there is {{an increased risk of}} local anesthetic toxicity, so less toxic anesthetics like chloroprocaine or mepivacaine mixed with ropivacaine are often recommended. A curvilinear ultrasound probe can be used but {{it is often difficult to}} see the plexus, so a nerve stimulator is used to locate it.|$|E
