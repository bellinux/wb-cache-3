5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} areas of interpretation of John is its sacramental theology. Scholars' views have fallen along a wide spectrum ranging from anti-sacramental and non-sacramental, to sacramental, to ultra-sacramental and hyper-sacramental. Scholars disagree both on whether and how frequently John refers to the sacraments at all, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> of importance he places upon them. Individual scholars' answers {{to one of these}} questions do not always correspond to their answer to the other.|$|E
5|$|In humans, bites {{from this}} species can produce severe local and {{systemic}} symptoms. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> {{and type of}} local effect, bites {{can be divided into}} two symptomatic categories: those with little or no surface extravasation, and those with hemorrhages evident as ecchymosis, bleeding and swelling. In both cases there is severe pain and tenderness, but in the latter there is widespread superficial or deep necrosis and compartment syndrome. Serious bites cause limbs to become immovably flexed as a result of significant hemorrhage or coagulation in the affected muscles. Residual induration, however, is rare and usually these areas completely resolve.|$|E
5|$|In {{psychological}} assessments, the name-letter {{effect has}} been exploited to measure self-esteem. There {{are two types of}} self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem. Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to introspection, measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts.|$|E

30|$|We proceed this way, {{since it}} is unfair to rank users by maximal belief masses they have <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>degrees.</b> This is because {{during the process of}} the masses fusion, a user’s {{influence}} increases and passes from an influence <b>degree</b> to <b>the</b> next greater <b>degree</b> and so on. Thus, for users who have many combinations, they pass from <b>the</b> weaker influence <b>degree</b> (V.Weak) until they reach high influence <b>degrees.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> masses <b>on</b> each <b>degree</b> starts weak, and as we combine, this mass becomes more important, and then it decreases and <b>the</b> mass <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next greater influence degree increases instead. For this reason, to rank users who have maximal belief mass <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same <b>degree</b> (for example, two users who have <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> V.Strong as a maximal degree), we should not consider the mass they have on this degree, because we may have a user more influential than another, although he has a weaker belief mass than him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same <b>degree.</b> This {{is due to the fact}} that, <b>the</b> belief mass <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next-greater <b>degree</b> has increased and became quite important. Hence, to compare users who have maximal belief mass <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same <b>degree,</b> we should rather consider <b>the</b> belief mass <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next greater <b>degree.</b>|$|R
5|$|Technically, a slave {{could not}} own property, but a slave who {{conducted}} business might be {{given access to}} an individual account or fund (peculium) that he could use {{as if it were}} his own. The terms of this account varied depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> of trust and co-operation between owner and slave: a slave with an aptitude for business could be given considerable leeway to generate profit, and might be allowed to bequeath the peculium he managed to other slaves of his household. Within a household or workplace, a hierarchy of slaves might exist, with one slave in effect acting as the master of other slaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{properties}} of thorium vary widely depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> of impurities in the sample. The major impurity is usually thorium dioxide (ThO2); even the purest thorium specimens usually contain about {{a tenth of}} a percent of the dioxide. Experimental measurements of its density give values between 11.5and11.66g/cm3: these are slightly lower than the theoretically expected value of 11.7g/cm3 calculated from thorium's lattice parameters, perhaps due to microscopic voids forming in the metal when it is cast. These values lie between those of its neighbours actinium (10.1g/cm3) and protactinium (15.4g/cm3), part of a trend across the early actinides.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} migration between the Nordic countries, but {{owing to the}} similarity between the cultures and languages (with the exception of Finnish), expatriates generally assimilate quickly and do not stand out as a group.

Outside Sweden and Finland, there are about 40,000 active learners enrolled in Swedish language courses.|$|E

5|$|A random {{assemblage}} of fish merely using some localised resource {{such as food}} or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> of organisation. A shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to {{other members of the}} group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to {{the other members of the}} group. Schools of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Y.Kobayasi {{reported}} the form L.mokusin f. sinensis, {{which he said}} differed from the main species in having a head that was more angular and conical at the top; the form sinensis was also reported in Korea in 1995. Some authors have attempted to define forms of L.mokusin as new species based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> of separation of the apical arms. For example, to contrast with his concept of Lysurus in which the arms were either free or slightly fused, the genus Lloydia was created by Chow in 1935 to contain species in which {{the tips of the}} arms were fused. As a result of various differing interpretations of the limits of L.mokusin, and the desire of some authors to define new species based on perceived differences, the fungus has acquired a lengthy list of synonyms over the years.|$|E
5|$|The {{crystallization}} of uric acid, often {{related to}} relatively high {{levels in the}} blood, is the underlying cause of gout. This can occur because of diet, genetic predisposition, or underexcretion of urate, the salts of uric acid. Underexcretion of uric acid by the kidney is {{the primary cause of}} hyperuricemia in about 90% of cases, while overproduction is the cause in less than 10%. About 10% of people with hyperuricemia develop gout {{at some point in their}} lifetimes. The risk, however, varies depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> of hyperuricemia. When levels are between 415 and 530μmol/l (7 and 8.9mg/dl), the risk is 0.5% per year, while in those with a level greater than 535μmol/l (9mg/dL), the risk is 4.5% per year.|$|E

5|$|The order Rodentia may {{be divided}} into suborders, infraorders, superfamilies and families. There {{is a great deal}} of {{parallelism}} and convergence among rodents caused by the fact that they have tended to evolve to fill largely similar niches. This parallel evolution includes not only the structure of the teeth, but also the infraorbital region of the skull (below the eye socket) and makes classification difficult as similar traits may not be due to common ancestry. Brandt (1855) was the first to propose dividing Rodentia into three suborders, Sciuromorpha, Hystricomorpha and Myomorpha, based on the development of certain muscles in the jaw and this system was widely accepted. Schlosser (1884) performed a comprehensive review of rodent fossils, mainly using the cheek teeth, and found that they fitted into the classical system, but Tullborg (1899) proposed just two sub-orders, Sciurognathi and Hystricognathi. These were based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> of inflection of the lower jaw and were to be further subdivided into Sciuromorpha, Myomorpha, Hystricomorpha and Bathyergomorpha. Matthew (1910) created a phylogenetic tree of New World rodents but did not include the more problematic Old World species. Further attempts at classification continued without agreement, with some authors adopting the classical three suborder system and others Tullborg's two suborders.|$|E
