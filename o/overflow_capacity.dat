XTM is implemented in software using virtual memory support. It operates at page granularity, using private copies of overflowed pages to buffer memory updates until the transaction commits and snapshots of pages to detect interference between transactions. We also describe two enhancements to XTM that use limited hardware support to address key performance bottlenecks. We compare XTM to hardwarebased virtualization using both real applications and synthetic microbenchmarks.

Overall, we demonstrate that XTM provides a complete, flexible, and low-cost mechanism for practical TM virtualization...|$|R

40|$|Completed in 1885, the Gold Creek dam is an earthen dam {{located on}} the {{outskirts}} of Brisbane, Australia. The spillway system was refurbished three times, each time to increase the maximum <b>overflow</b> <b>capacity.</b> In 1890, a concrete stepped waterway was built to replace the damaged unlined-rock channel.

The characteristics of the dam and its unusual stepped spillway are reviewed in a historical context. The design is compared with contemporary structures and present knowledge in stepped spillway design.

40|$|The {{background}} {{of this study}} is a rather classical but complex inventory control/production planning/line scheduling problem of a major soft-drink company in Hong Kong. The issue that stands out for this many-product high-sales manufacture is the storage space of its central warehouse, which often finds itself in the state of <b>overflow</b> or near <b>capacity</b> with finished goods and work-in-process inventory. This phenomenon can create immediate interruptions of production, capital tie-ups and subsequent potential of lost saales. Another obviously important concern is the meeting of forecast demands. A mathematical modelling approach that entails techniques of multi-period aggregate optimization is proposed to tackle the overall problem. The dual objectives are to achieve better production planning and line scheduling in order to minimize inventory build-up maximize demand satisfaction.

40|$|Abstract—Capacity and buffer {{sizes are}} {{critical}} design parameters in schedulers which multiplex many flows. Previous {{studies show that}} in an asymptotic regime, {{when the number of}} traffic flows N goes to infinity, the choice of scheduling algorithm does not have a big impact on performance. We raise the question whether or not the choice of scheduling algorithm impacts the capacity and buffer sizing for moderate values of N (e. g., few hundred). For Markov-modulated On-Off sources and for finite N, we show that the choice of scheduling is influential on (1) buffer <b>overflow</b> probability, (2) <b>capacity</b> provisioning, and (3) the viability of network decomposition in a non-asymptotic regime. This conclusion is drawn based on numerical examples and by a comparison of the scaling properties of different scheduling algorithms. In particular, we show that the per-flow capacity converges to the per-flow long-term average (√ rate of) the log N arrivals with convergence speeds ranging from O t...|$|R
