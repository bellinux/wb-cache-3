5000|$|Oil van : The Oil van fits an <b>oil</b> <b>canister</b> to {{the back}} of a player's car. When deployed, the oil pours out onto the road behind players, causing any cars that drive over it to skid uncontrollably until they crash. This can be very powerful, and also allows players to destroy the armored Jeep. Players should be careful not to let civilians get caught in the mess.|$|E
50|$|On {{the return}} {{journey from the}} pole, the men find that the <b>oil</b> <b>canisters</b> in the depots are not full. The seals are not broken, so they {{speculate}} that the oil has evaporated.|$|R
5000|$|The company {{initially}} {{used the}} trade name of [...] "Atlas" [...] for the accessory and supply segment, producing vehicle lights, signaling equipment, fuel and <b>oil</b> <b>canisters,</b> jacks and air pumps. In October 1926, the company patented its crank drive for lowerable windows. After buying {{the rights to}} use the patent for the wrap sling brake from the American company Ternstedt, series production of mechanical window regulators started in 1928. Commonly {{referred to as a}} window crank apparatus, this device was also manufactured for buses, trains and streetcars. Windshields and ventilation systems expanded the range of products in the years following.|$|R
40|$|This paper summarises {{research}} and commercial developments in robotics for handling and processing tasks involving {{a high degree}} of variability. The variability is often derived from the characteristics of individual items to be processed e. g. natural product items such as meat portions or fish fillets which vary uniquely on an individual basis. Research into flexible knowledge-biled programming, sensor measurement, and sensor feedback to accommodate task variability is described. Example developed systems include scaled wall framing construction for domestic buildings using expert knowledge on building techniques, palletising of variable-size <b>oil</b> <b>canisters,</b> automated de-boning of fish fillets, and robotic cutting of lamb carcasses. The projects described were all carried out by members of the Advance...|$|R
5000|$|Lagenda Z 110cc - (2005-2010) The Lagenda Z is the facelifted {{version of}} the Lagenda 110cc and started {{production}} since 2005. The model is facelifted in January 2008, returning the former [...] "Lagenda" [...] logo from the Lagenda 110. The 2008 model {{is equipped with a}} key slot cover for better protection against theft. The moped is sold at RM4,686.35 for the kick-start version and RM4,999.25 for the electric version.Lagenda ZR 110cc - (2005-2010) A modified {{version of the}} Lagenda Z for those who prefer more sporty features. Prominent features include sport rims, electric starter, and the rear absorbers have extra <b>oil</b> <b>canisters</b> for a smoother ride on uneven roads. This model is only available in blue and has exactly the same engine specification as the Lagenda Z.|$|R
5|$|Enemy {{detection}} {{works on}} line-of-sight, with players {{being able to}} use cover or high areas out of enemies' cones of vision to stay undetected. Darkness can aid the player in staying hidden, {{but it is only}} effective at a distance. Enemy alert meters and musical cues let the player know if they've been spotted. Noise will cause enemies to go to investigate, including noise made by broken bottles or the player striking a sword against the wall; this may be used deliberately to lure guards into traps or disrupt their patrol route. Players can look through keyholes to help them survey a room before entering, and can lean to look from cover without fully exposing themselves. The player is now able to be detected if they peer out from behind a wall for too long, a feature not seen in Dishonored. To avoid detection, the player may choke people out or have their throat slit. Bodies can be carried away and concealed. Alarms can be disabled to assure that enemies are not alerted to the player's presence. Walls of Light, barriers powered by wind or whale oil, are subject to have their power turned off or be rewired so that only enemies are killed by going through them. Whale <b>oil</b> <b>canisters</b> explode on harsh impact, and can be thrown at enemies to that end.|$|R
50|$|Minor {{changes were}} made to the unit during its production, {{including}} an uprated oil pump around mid-1997, with the addition of larger oilways in the head machining (T-Vents), and modified valve lifters to reduce top-end valve noise, at which point the cam belt arrangement also changed with the lower idler moving. Around 1998, the spin-on metal <b>canister</b> <b>oil</b> filter was changed to a disposable paper element.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Pressure {{safety relief}} valve is the key {{component}} in any system where pressure rising could be hazardous to safety of the workers as well as plant. Though electronically operated safety controls are there, but {{to take care of}} any malfunctioning in it, mechanically operated relief valve is necessary. In oil refinery sector, safety is of prime important. The clay canisters are used to refine the <b>oil.</b> Sometimes these <b>canisters</b> get clogged and pressure rising may take place. The key requirement of process is to relieve this pressure rise in no time. Conventional valves are unable to fulfill that requirement. This paper focuses on design and analysis of an emergency safety valve by Design by Analysis (DBA) approach. From the data given by the client, suitable valve is designed using FEA. The working environment is hazardous & explosive; hence ASME code is used to design. This valve is a onetime operating valve used as tertiary safety arrangement for critical applications...|$|R
