It is an effective antidepressant on its own, but is also popular as an add-on medication in cases of incomplete response to first-line SSRI antidepressants. Bupropion is taken in tablet form and is available <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>prescription</b> in most countries.|$|E
2500|$|Athletes in many {{sports have}} used {{human growth hormone}} in order to attempt to enhance their {{athletic}} performance. Some recent studies {{have not been able}} to support claims that human growth hormone can improve the athletic performance of professional male athletes. [...] Many athletic societies ban the use of GH and will issue sanctions against athletes who are caught using it. However, because GH is a potent endogenous protein, it is very difficult to detect GH doping. In the United States, GH is legally available <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>prescription</b> from a medical doctor.|$|E
2500|$|In the US {{even though}} {{sildenafil}} is available <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>prescription</b> from a doctor, it was advertised directly to consumers on TV (famously being endorsed by former United States Senator Bob Dole and football star Pel√©). Numerous {{sites on the}} Internet offer Viagra for sale after an [...] "online consultation", often a simple web questionnaire. The Viagra name has become so well known, many fake aphrodisiacs now call themselves [...] "herbal viagra" [...] or are presented as blue tablets imitating the shape and colour of Pfizer's product. Viagra is also informally known as [...] "vitamin V", [...] "the blue pill", or [...] "blue diamond", as well as various other nicknames.|$|E

2500|$|Orlistat (Xenical) reduces {{intestinal}} fat absorption by inhibiting pancreatic lipase. [...] Some side-effects {{of using}} Orlistat include frequent, oily bowel movements (steatorrhea). But if {{fat in the}} diet is reduced, symptoms often improve. [...] Originally available <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>prescription,</b> it {{was approved by the}} FDA for over-the-counter sale in February 2007. On 26 May 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a revised label for Xenical to include new safety information about cases of severe liver injury that have been reported rarely with the use of this medication. [...] Of the 40 million users of Orlistat worldwide, 13 cases of severe liver damage have been reported.|$|E
2500|$|Side {{effects of}} {{melatonin}} may include sleep disturbance, nightmares, daytime sleepiness, and depression, though the current tendency to use lower doses has decreased such complaints. Large doses of melatonin {{can even be}} counterproductive: Lewy et al. provide support to [...] "the idea that too much melatonin may spill over onto the wrong zone of the melatonin phase-response curve." [...] The long-term effects of melatonin administration have not been examined. In some countries, the hormone is available <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>prescription</b> or not at all. In the United States and Canada, melatonin is on the shelf of most pharmacies and herbal stores. The prescription drug Rozerem (ramelteon) is a melatonin analogue that selectively binds to the melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors and, hence, has {{the possibility of being}} effective in the treatment of DSPD.|$|E

50|$|Under prohibition, {{millions}} of people {{find it very difficult}} to obtain controlled medications, particularly opiate pain-relievers. The United Nations 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs requires that opiates be distributed <b>only</b> <b>by</b> medical <b>prescription,</b> but this is impractical in many areas.|$|R

5000|$|New drugs receive {{extensive}} scrutiny before FDA {{approval in}} a process called a new drug application (NDA).

A drug that is approved {{is said to be}} [...] "safe and effective when used as directed".|$|E

Rapper Pimp C, from the group UGK, died from an overdose of this combination. [...] This mixture is, owing to promethazine being a prescription-only antihistamine, available <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>prescription</b> in all 50 U.S. states.|$|E
50|$|Motofen {{is higher}} priced than both Imodium and Lomotil, {{does not have}} a generic equivalent, and is <b>only</b> {{available}} <b>by</b> <b>prescription</b> in the United States. Many United States insurance companies do not include Motofen as one of their formulary drugs, causing consumers to pay the highest copay, if it is covered by their health insurance at all. This is most likely due to the high cost of the medication itself, and the fact that similar lower-priced medicines can help ease symptoms of diarrhea. The United States is currently the only country where Motofen tablets are prescribed, approved by the government, and sold.|$|R
50|$|Self-medication {{is highly}} {{regulated}} {{in much of}} the world and many classes of drugs are available for administration <b>only</b> upon <b>prescription</b> <b>by</b> licensed medical personnel.
