5|$|Fleming {{subsequently}} {{requested that}} there should be no reprints or paperback version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>and</b> for the British market no paperback version appeared until after Fleming's death. Because of the heightened sexual writing in the novel, it was banned in a number of countries. In the US the story was also published in Stag magazine, with the title changed to Motel Nymph.|$|E

5|$|In 1873, {{journalist}} George Alfred Townsend published Washington, Outside and Inside. A Picture and A Narrative of the Origin, Growth, Excellences, Abuses, Beauties, and Personages of Our Governing City, a {{work that}} covered the history of Washington from its inception to the then-present day. The Civil War defenses of Washington figure prominently in the later portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>and</b> he uses the state of Fort Stanton {{as an example of}} what had become of the forts a decade after they had been built.|$|E
5|$|Motte was a London {{publisher}} {{who took}} over Benjamin Tooke's publishing business, which printed many of Swift's earlier works. In 1726, Swift sent Motte a copy of Gulliver's Travels to be printed anonymously. Motte took great care to protect {{the identity of the}} author, and employed five publishing houses to speed production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> avoid unlicensed copying. In 1727, Motte formed his first direct contract with Swift in order to publish Swift's Miscellanies. As part of the contract, Motte paid Tooke for the original copyright to the work.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Army and Navy {{strongly}} approved <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> {{several thousand}} copies {{of it were}} bought by the War Ministry and Naval Ministry who {{by the beginning of}} 1934 were distributing the books for free to foreign journalists and officials. By contrast, the Nationalist Government of China responded by banning Townsend's book throughout China from 1935. Even so, the journalist George Moorad reported that in 1946 Chinese communists distributed contraband copies of the book to American China Marines in the hopes of disillusioning them about conditions in China.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> {{the subject}} matter of the poem within it share a metaphorical connection in the decay of memory. In this light, critic Peter Schwenger asserts that Agrippa can be understood as organized by two ideas: the death of Gibson's father, and the disappearance or absence of the book itself. In this sense, it instantiates the ephemeral nature of all text.|$|E
5|$|When released, Raptor Red was {{generally}} praised: Bakker's anthropomorphism {{was seen as}} a unique and positive aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>and</b> his writing was described as folksy and heartfelt. Criticisms of the novel included a perceived lack of characterization and average writing. Some scientists, such as paleontologist David B. Norman, took issue with the scientific theories portrayed in the novel, fearing that the public would accept them as fact, while Discovery Channel host Jay Ingram defended Bakker's creative decisions in an editorial.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Tapps in 1835, his son Sir George William Tapps-Gervis {{inherited}} his father's estate. He hired the young local architect Benjamin Ferrey to develop the coastal area {{on the east side}} of the stream. Bournemouth's first hotel, later to become part of the Royal Bath Hotel, opened in 1838 and is one of the few buildings designed by Ferrey still standing. Bournemouth started to grow at a faster rate as Tapps-Gervis began developing the area similarly to the south coast resorts of Weymouth and Brighton. Despite enormous investment, the town's share of the market remained modest. In 1841 Tapps-Gervis invited the physician and writer Augustus Granville to stay. Granville was the author of The Spas of England, which described health resorts around the country, and as a result of his visit he included a chapter on Bournemouth in the second edition of his book. The publication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>and</b> the increase in visitors seeking the medicinal use of seawater and the pine-scented air, helped the town to grow and establish itself as an early tourist destination.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the court {{vacation}} in August 1904, Hastings decided that {{it would be best to}} find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give briefs to a barrister of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book on the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> reduced how much he would actually have to write.|$|E
5|$|During mid-1997, Jackson and Walsh {{began writing}} with Stephen Sinclair. Sinclair's partner, Philippa Boyens, {{was a major}} fan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> joined the writing team after reading their treatment. It took 13–14 months to write the two film scripts, which were 147 and 144 pages respectively. Sinclair left the project due to {{theatrical}} obligations. Amongst their revisions, Sam is caught eavesdropping and forced {{to go along with}} Frodo, instead of Sam, Merry, and Pippin figuring out about the One Ring themselves and voluntarily going along after confronting Frodo about it, as occurs in the original novel. Gandalf's account of his time at Orthanc was pulled out of flashback and Lothlórien was cut, with Galadriel doing what she does in the story at Rivendell. Denethor attends the Council with his son. Other changes included having Arwen rescue Frodo, and the action sequence involving the cave troll. The writers also considered having Arwen absorb Éowyn's role entirely by having her kill the Witch-king.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, {{she began}} writing In a German Women's Prison, recounting her {{experience}} in jail with political prisoners and petty criminals. The French newspaper Le Monde published excerpts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>and</b> {{it was soon}} translated and published in English, German, Russian, Spanish and Chinese, making her a celebrity. In the summer of 1934 the Soviet luminary Maxim Gorky invited her to attend the First Congress of Russian Writers, and reportedly singled her out for praise. In Moscow she met the Chinese Communist leaders Li Lisan and Kang Sheng, who asked {{her to go to}} Hong Kong to act as a liaison between left-wing KMT leaders and the Communists.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{botanist}} Asa Gray, an American {{colleague of}} Darwin, negotiated with a Boston publisher for publication of an authorised American version, but learnt that two New York publishing firms were already planning {{to exploit the}} absence of international copyright to print Origin. Darwin was delighted by the popularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>and</b> asked Gray to keep any profits. Gray managed to negotiate a 5% royalty with Appleton's of New York, who got their edition out in mid January 1860, {{and the other two}} withdrew. In a May letter, Darwin mentioned a print run of 2,500 copies, {{but it is not clear}} if this referred to the first printing only as there were four that year.|$|E
5|$|Many women's {{rights activists}} {{who worked with}} Stanton were opposed to the {{publication}} of The Woman's Bible; they felt it would harm the drive for women's suffrage. Although it was never accepted by Bible scholars as a major work, it became a popular best-seller, much {{to the dismay of}} suffragists who worked alongside Stanton within the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Susan B. Anthony tried to calm the younger suffragists, but they issued a formal denunciation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>and</b> worked to distance the suffrage movement from Stanton's broader scope which included attacks on traditional religion. Because of the widespread negative reaction, including that of suffragists who had been close to her, publication of the book effectively ended Stanton's influence in the suffrage movement.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{generally}} gave positive reviews <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> {{were impressed}} by the novel's suspense and vernacular language. In addition to the Newbery Medal, Shiloh has received several state awards voted upon by children, including the Sequoyah Children's Book Award, the Mark Twain Readers Award, and the William Allen White Children's Book Award. In 1996, the book was adapted into a movie of the same name. The novel spawned three sequels, Shiloh Season, Saving Shiloh, and A Shiloh Christmas published in 1996, 1997, and 2015, respectively. Shiloh is taught in many elementary school courses in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Satisfied {{with his}} skills, the {{publishers}} asked Tolkien {{to design a}} dust jacket. This project, too, {{became the subject of}} many iterations and much correspondence, with Tolkien always writing disparagingly of his own ability to draw. The runic inscription {{around the edges of the}} illustration are a phonetic transliteration of English, giving the title <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> details of the author and publisher. The original jacket design contained several shades of various colours, but Tolkien redrew it several times using fewer colours each time. His final design consisted of four colours. The publishers, mindful of the cost, removed the red from the sun to end up with only black, blue, and green ink on white stock.|$|E
5|$|The 10th Mountain Division was {{the subject}} of the 1996 film Fire on the Mountain, which {{documented}} its exploits during World War II. The 10th Mountain Division is also a prominent element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> film Black Hawk Down, which portrays the Battle of Mogadishu and the division's participation in that conflict. Among the division's other appearances are the Tom Clancy novel Clear and Present Danger, the SCI FI 2005 film Manticore, Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds, and Sean Parnell's war memoir about his platoon's experiences in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom, titled Outlaw Platoon (2012).|$|E
5|$|The {{second book}} was {{published}} {{on the subject of}} The Bitmap Brothers, a prominent British developer known for games such as Speedball, Xenon, and The Chaos Engine. Written by games journalist Duncan Harris, the 360-page book covers the developer's catalogue alongside concept art and interviews with its personnel. It features information about the developer's unfinished games and possible sequels. An interview with Sega's Tetsuya Mizuguchi spoke to the developer's influence, and musicians Tim Simenon and John Foxx discussed the role of music in the developer's games. Patrons who crowdfunded the project on Kickstarter received rewards including signed copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> art prints. Nintendo Life reviewer praised the book's anecdotes and recommended the title for readers interested in the history of British games.|$|E
