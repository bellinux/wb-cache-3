5000|$|The {{idea for}} a cable hauled street railway in California belonged to Benjamin Brooks, who {{was not able to}} {{accomplish}} it {{due to the lack of}} capital. Instead, Andrew Hallidie, a Scottish emigre, gave San Francisco the first effective and commercially successful route, using steel cables. Hallidie was a manufacturer of such cables. The system featured a man <b>operated</b> <b>grip,</b> which was able to start the carrier and stop it safely as well. The rope that was used allowed the independent use of more than one cable car at once and soon Hallidie`s concept was extended to the whole city of San Francisco. The carriers had a capacity of between 14 and 16 people but during the rush hours, they could fit between 24 and 26 passengers without any problems. The tickets cost about 5 cents, which was relatively expensive for back then but still seems unbelievable compared to the price today - approximately 5 dollars! ...|$|R

25|$|Two {{versions}} of Kong's {{right hand and}} arm were constructed of steel, sponge rubber, rubber, and bearskin. The first hand was non articulated, mounted on a crane, and <b>operated</b> by <b>grips</b> for the scene in which Kong grabs at Driscoll in the cave. The other hand and arm had articulated fingers, was mounted on a lever to elevate it, and {{was used in the}} several scenes in which Kong grasps Ann. A non articulated leg was created of materials similar to the hands, mounted on a crane, and used to stomp on Kong's victims.|$|R
25|$|The {{driver of}} a cable car {{is known as}} the gripman or grip operator. This is a highly skilled job, {{requiring}} the gripman to smoothly <b>operate</b> the <b>grip</b> lever to grip and release the cable, release the grip at certain points to coast the vehicle over crossing cables or places where the cable does not follow the tracks, and to anticipate well in advance possible collisions with other traffic that may not understand the limitations of a cable car. Being a gripman requires great upper body strength needed for the grip and brakes, as well as good hand–eye coordination and balance.|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} that the user only leans on the robotic cart without <b>operating</b> the handle <b>grips,</b> all of the user’s weight becomes a load {{detected}} by the DFSs; thus, no signal is sensed by the FFSs or BFSs. Therefore, we can ensure that the robotic cart remains stationary by monitoring the value from the DFSs.|$|R
50|$|Model A has {{a manual}} safety {{on the left}} side of the frame as well as a Browning-style grip safety at the rear of the frame. This feature ensures that the firing {{mechanism}} does not <b>operate</b> unless the <b>grip</b> lock is depressed against the palm of the operator's hand, thereby eliminating chances of accidental firing of the weapon.|$|R
25|$|Safeties: A grip safety, sear disconnect, slide stop, a half cock position, and manual safety (located on {{the left}} rear of the frame) are on all {{standard}} M1911A1s. Several companies have developed a firing pin block. Colt's 80 series uses a trigger operated one and several other manufacturers (such as Smith & Wesson) use one <b>operated</b> by the <b>grip</b> safety.|$|R
50|$|The camera dolly {{may be used}} as a {{shooting}} platform on any surface but is often raised onto a track, to create smooth movement on a horizontal axis known as a tracking shot. Additionally, most professional film studio dollies have a hydraulic jib arm that raises or lowers the camera on the vertical axis. When a dolly <b>grip</b> <b>operates</b> a dolly on perpendicular axes simultaneously, it's known as a compound move.|$|R
50|$|A two-pinned lewis {{consists}} of two 13 mm diameter steel pins, linked by a short chain. The pins are inserted into opposing holes that are drilled {{into the top of}} the stone at about 15° from vertical, and at least 75 mm deep. It <b>operates</b> by <b>gripping</b> the stone (like two fingers lifting a tenpin bowling ball) as the weight of the stone is taken up by a crane or winch. The advantage of using this type of lewis is that it is simple to prepare—two angled drill holes are all that is necessary. Like other types of lewis, it is susceptible to pulling out as the stone is lifted. It should always be tested before hoisting, and used in conjunction with safety slings.|$|R
30|$|We, then, {{carried out}} some {{measurement}} experiments {{to confirm the}} effectiveness of our proposed handling interface. In the measurement experiments, the participant (normal male age 23) <b>operated</b> the handle <b>grip</b> of the prototype robotic cart which is shown in Fig.  10. We measured the force signals detected by the FFS, BFS, and DFS when the participant moved {{in a straight line}} and only twisted the handle grip in the forward and backward directions.|$|R
40|$|We {{assess the}} effects of stretch rate on the {{mechanical}} properties of Prolene® (Ethicon, Gynecare, Somerville, NJ, USA), a knitted polypropylene mesh. Prolene®, consisting of macroporous knitted polypropylene, is considered here as a suitable proxy to midurethral tape (MUT) {{as well as to}} many other prosthesis products used in surgery applications. Such products are utilized to treat urine incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, as well as hernia in humans. Of the mechanical properties of special significance are the following three properties: peak load (N), extension (%) at peak load, and linear stiffness (N/mm). Uniaxial tensile testing was performed on mesh samples on a universal testing machine and involved loading different samples at 5 cross-head speeds of: 1, 10, 50, 100, and 500 mm/min. The corresponding properties were measured under these 5 conditions. In order to minimize damage to the specimens at the jaws, special dual action pneumatically <b>operated</b> <b>grips</b> with rubber faced jaws were used to hold the samples in place. The effectiveness of these grips was illustrated by the fact that none of the failed samples broke at grips. Statistically significant findings suggest an increasing trend for Prolene® stiffness vs. stretch rate (R 2 = 0. 9679; two-tailed p value = 0. 0025) where the stiffness increases 26. 2 % when increasing the displacement rate from 1 to 500 mm/min. For extension (%) at peak load, a decreasing trend was found vs. stretch rate (R 2 = 0. 81; two-tailed p value = 0. 037) where increasing the displacement rate from 1 mm/min to 500 mm/min corresponds to a 22 % decrease in the relative elongation of the mesh. No statistically significant dependence of peak load on stretch rate was found. These findings may help workers in the biomedical field develop suitable uniaxial tensile testing protocols of such materials. N/...|$|R
40|$|For {{a method}} for <b>operating</b> a <b>gripping</b> device using {{electrostatic}} forces, in which a potential difference is generated for a gripping operation between electrodes of an electrode pair arranged in a gripping element (1, 11) of the gripping device, it is proposed that, in order to deposit a gripped article, the absolute value, between the electrodes, of the potential difference is reduced {{and in the process}} the sign of the potential difference is changed at least once. An electrostatic gripping device suitable therefor, comprising a gripping element (1, 11) having an electrode pair and means for generating a potential difference between the electrodes of the electrode pair, is characterized by means for lowering the absolute value, between the electrodes, of the potential difference and for changing the sign of the potential difference...|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} <b>operated</b> using two <b>grip</b> trams which were later {{destroyed by a}} fire. Later, the line was operated by the former Elgin Road grip tram, DCCT No 106. When this car was being overhauled, it would be replaced by 'convertible' grip tram No 105, which {{was used as a}} spare car on the Mornington and Maryhill lines as its grip could be set at two different heights to allow it to run on either line.|$|R
25|$|The {{military}} mandated a grip {{safety and}} a manual safety. A grip safety, sear disconnect, slide stop, half cock position, and manual safety (located {{on the left}} rear of the frame) are on all standard M1911A1s. Several companies have developed a firing pin block safety. Colt's 80 series uses a trigger operated one and several other manufacturers, including Kimber and Smith & Wesson, use a Swartz firing-pin safety, which is <b>operated</b> by the <b>grip</b> safety. Language cautioning against pulling the trigger with the second finger {{was included in the}} initial M1911 manual, and later manuals up to the 1940s.|$|R
5000|$|Inspector Frederick Abberline {{investigates the}} Ripper crimes without success until a {{fraudulent}} psychic, Robert James Lees, {{acting on a}} personal grudge against Gull, identifies him as the murderer. Gull confesses, and Lees and Abberline, shocked, report the matter to superiors within the police, who cover up the discovery. They inform both Abberline and Lees that Gull was <b>operating</b> alone, and <b>gripped</b> by insanity. Abberline later discovers through chance Gull's actual intentions {{to cover up the}} matter of the royal [...] "bastard" [...] fathered by the Duke of Clarence, and resigns from the Metropolitan Police, protesting the official cover-up of the murders.|$|R
50|$|Like the M1911, the Ruger 1911 {{is single}} action only. It also has {{features}} such as a beavertail grip safety and a manually operated thumb safety. In addition to these two safeties, the Ruger SR1911 also has a sear disconnect, slide stop and half-cock position. Although Colt's 80 series developed a trigger operated firing pin block safety, and Kimber and Smith & Wesson use a Swartz firing-pin safety, which is <b>operated</b> by the <b>grip</b> safety; the Ruger SR1911 pistol features a titanium firing pin and heavy firing pin spring, which negates {{the need for a}} firing pin block, offering an updated safety feature without compromising trigger pull weight.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Although {{researchers}} have studied various parameters that affect grip force, few studies investigate {{the effects of}} tactile sensation on pinch force. This study aims to determine the influences of tactile sensation on pinch force with a special emphasis on screw knobs under loaded and unloaded conditions. The participants included 32 manual workers who were required to pinch and turn the knobs to generate pinch force under reduced and increased sensations simulated using cotton and nitrile gloves. The data were analysed using the analysis of variance via Minitab 16. Results show that the pinch force exerted for reduced sensations is {{higher than that of}} increased sensations because the reduced friction increased skin-object slippages, which caused participants to spontaneously increase their force to prevent slippages. This study serves as a guideline to potentially improve the design of objects <b>operated</b> with pinch <b>grips</b> to be safe and suitable for manual, sedentary or general tasks...|$|R
