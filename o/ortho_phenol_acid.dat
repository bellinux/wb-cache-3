They base their mechanism on results from hybrid DFT calculations with B3LYP functionals using the programs Gaussian03 and Jaguar. The opening of the aromatic ring in homogentisate is a multi-step process. In the first two steps Fe2+ coordinates to the carbonyl and <b>ortho</b> <b>phenol</b> oxygens. The iron atom is also coordinated to His335, His371, and Glu341. O2 then binds to the iron atom., subsequently reacting with the aromatic ring to form a peroxo-bridged intermediate.|$|R

In this study, SRB strains showed tolerance (up to 5 mM) towards <b>phenol,</b> benzoic <b>acid</b> and catechol. The strains also grew in the presence of cadmium, however variations were observed with respect to cadmium toxicity between the cultures as revealed by their patterns of lactate utilization, acetate production, sulphate-reduction and protein production. Desulfovibrio vulgaris DSM 644 showed the least tolerance while Desulfovibrio desulfuricans DSM 1926 and Desulfococcus multivorans DSM 2059 showed maximum tolerance towards cadmium. Treatments with cadmium in combination of either <b>phenol,</b> benzoic <b>acid</b> or catechol showed no significant effect on growth compared to growth on cadmium alone for three SRB strains tested. However, a mixed SRB culture showed decreased tolerance to cadmium in the presence of <b>phenol,</b> benzoic <b>acid</b> and catechol and Desulfomicrobium norvegicans II showed increased tolerance to cadmium in presence of <b>phenol</b> and benzoic <b>acid.</b> All SRB strains tested were found capable to precipitate cadmium as sulphide from the growth medium. Metal removal was also observed in the presence of the organic compounds but less metal precipitation was detected in the presence of catechol. Two strains, Desulfovibrio vulgaris DSM 644 and Desulfococcus multivorans DSM 2059 showed oxidation of <b>phenol</b> and benzoic <b>acid.</b> Benzoic acid oxidation was also demonstrated by Desulfovibrio desulfuricans DSM 1926.

Desulfovibrio desulfuricans DSM 1926 and Desulfococcus multivorans DSM 2059 also showed DNA homology with known genes encoding heavy metal translocating ATPases.
