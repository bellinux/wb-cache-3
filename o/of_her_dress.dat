5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1851, women in several states were wearing the dress in public. In March, Amelia Bloomer, editor of the temperance {{newspaper}} The Lily, announced that she was wearing it and printed a description <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> along with {{instructions on how to}} make it. Soon, newspapers had dubbed it the “Bloomer dress”, and the name stuck.|$|E
5|$|Although van der Weyden did not title the work, and the sitter's {{name is not}} {{recorded}} {{in any of the}} early inventories, the style <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> has been used to place the picture very late in van der Weyden's career. The c.1460 dating is based on the high-fashion dress and the work's apparent chronological position in the evolution of van der Weyden's style. However, it is possible that it was executed even later (van der Weyden died in 1464).|$|E
5|$|Anna has {{distinguishable}} {{facial features}} of a typical Disney heroine, including big eyes, thin lips and a small nose. Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even has them on her shoulders. Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of magenta, black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs on the bottom <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>dress.</b>|$|E

5|$|Christus frames his sitter in a {{rigid and}} {{balanced}} architectural setting. She is positioned within a narrow rectangular space, before a wainscotted wall. The image is {{divided by the}} horizontal parallel lines of her wainscot and blouse, which join at the inverted triangle formed by the neckline <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>dress.</b> The rendering of the background departs somewhat from contemporary conventions in portraiture: Christus sets the girl against a dark brown wall with little detail, {{in contrast to the}} elaborate interiors of Jan van Eyck, who is often regarded as Christus' master. It is defined entirely by its material, a wooden dado rail along the top and the wainscot that forms the lower portion. The wall sets her in a realistic interior, perhaps intended to represent a space within her home.|$|E
5|$|The {{panel is}} the {{smallest}} extant work by van der Weyden and follows the tradition of a Madonna Lactans, with significant differences. Christ {{is dressed in a}} red garment, as opposed to the swaddling he usually wears in 15th-century Virgin and Child portrayals. This is one of two exceptions where he is fully clothed; the other is Robert Campin's Madonna in Frankfurt, where he is shown in blue clothing. Mary's unbound blond hair falls across her shoulders and down across her arms. Showing the influence of Campin, it is brushed behind the ears. She wears a crown as Queen of Heaven and a ring on a finger as the Bride of Christ. Reinforcing this, the blue colour of her robe alludes to her devotion and fidelity to her son. The folds <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> are reminiscent of the lengthy, crisp, curved intertwined gowns of Gothic sculpture.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{the subject}} of L'Âme de la France has its own {{individual}} characteristics that contrast strongly with its martial attributes. First, she was “lovingly fashioned down to the smallest details, from the folds <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> to her splendid braids”, two long pigtails that “slide down her back”. In addition and even more importantly, she represents a young half-nude woman, her belly and her breasts bared “to the open air”, the slender body and the head turned to the right in a position that is ultimately very sensual.|$|E
25|$|Most historians {{believe that}} a {{portrait}} miniature (shown here)—which exists in two versions by Holbein (Royal Collection and Duke of Buccleuch)—is the only surviving image of Catherine painted from life (in {{the case of the}} Windsor version). The historian David Starkey dated it (from details <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> and the technique of the miniature) to the short period when Catherine was queen. In it, she wears the same large jewel as Jane Seymour in Holbein's panel portrait in Vienna. Records show that these jewels belonged to the Crown, not to any queen personally, and there is no record that they were removed from the treasury and given to anyone else.|$|E
25|$|Juvenal's {{account of}} her nights spent in the brothel is {{commonly}} portrayed. Gustave Moreau paints her leading another man onto the bed while an exhausted prostitute sleeps in the background, while in Paul Rouffio's painting of 1875 she reclines bare-breasted as a slave offers grapes. The Dane Peder Severin Krøyer depicts her standing, her full body apparent under the thin material <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>dress.</b> The ranks of her customers are just visible behind the curtain against which she stands (see above). Two drawings by Aubrey Beardsley were produced for a private printing of Juvenal's satires (1897). The one titled Messalina and her companion shows her {{on the way to}} the brothel, while a rejected drawing is usually titled Messalina returning from the bath.|$|E

25|$|The {{procession}} included foreign royalty {{and heads}} of state riding to Westminster Abbey in various carriages, so many that volunteers ranging from wealthy businessmen to rural landowners were required to supplement the insufficient ranks of regular footmen. The first royal coach left Buckingham Palace and moved down the Mall, which was filled with flag-waving and cheering crowds. It {{was followed by the}} Irish State Coach carrying Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who wore the circlet of her crown bearing the Koh-i-Noor diamond. Queen Elizabeth II proceeded through London from Buckingham Palace, through Trafalgar Square, and towards the abbey in the Gold State Coach. Attached to the shoulders <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>dress,</b> the Queen wore the Robe of State, a 6-yard (5.5metre) long, hand woven silk velvet cloak lined with Canadian ermine that required the assistance of the Queen's maids of honour—Lady Jane Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Lady Anne Coke, Lady Moyra Hamilton, Lady Mary Baillie-Hamilton, Lady Jane Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, Lady Rosemary Spencer-Churchill and the Duchess of Devonshire—to carry.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{influences}} of the Pompeii and Herculaneum excavations, several other factors came together to popularize neoclassical dress. Starting in the early 1790s, Emma Hamilton began her performances of attitudes, something that was considered by contemporaries as entirely new. These attitudes were based loosely on the ancient practice of pantomime, though Emma’s performances lacked masks and musical accompaniment. Her performances created a fusion between art and nature; art came alive and her body became a type of art. As an aid to her performances of tragic mythological and historical figures, Emma wore the clothing á la grecque that would become popular in mainstream France in the coming years. A simple light colored chemise made from thin, flowing material was worn and gathered with a narrow ribbon under the breasts. Simple cashmere shawls were used as headdresses or to give more fullness to the drapery of the chemise. They also helped to prevent broken lines in the performance so that the outstretched arms were always connected with the body, escalating the effect of fluid movement, and oftentimes, a cape or a cloak was worn to emphasize {{the lines of the}} body in certain poses. This highlighted the continuity of surface of line and form {{in the body of the}} performer to emphasize the unity, simplicity, and continuously flowing movement from one part of the body to the next. The hair was worn in a natural, loose, and flowing fashion. All of these properties blended together to allow an extensive play of light and shadow to reveal and accent certain parts of the body during the performance, while covering others. Emma was highly capable in her attitudes, and the influence <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> spread from Naples to Paris as wealthy Parisians took the Grand Tour.|$|E

500|$|Clothing {{played an}} {{important}} factor in Monroe's star image. She often wore white to emphasize her blondness, and drew attention by wearing revealing outfits that showed off her figure. Her publicity stunts often revolved around her clothing that exposed large amounts of her body or even a wardrobe malfunction, such as when one of the shoulder straps <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> suddenly snapped during a press conference. In press stories, Monroe was portrayed as the embodiment of the American Dream, a girl who had risen from a miserable childhood to Hollywood stardom.

Portinari has dark eyes, a strong nose, full lips and a pointed chin. Her visible hand, folded in prayer but unrealistically off center, wears what looks like a jeweled ring. The dark sleeves <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> contain red or rouge velvet-like cloth tightened by a white belt. Her hair is shaved back to achieve the high forehead and sculptural look fashionable at the time.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, a small figure dated {{at around}} 800 AD was {{discovered}} in Hårby, Denmark by three amateur archaeologists. The figurine portrays a woman with long hair knotted into a ponytail who is wearing a long dress which is sleeveless and vest like at the top. Over the top <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> she is wearing an embroidered apron. Her clothing keeps the woman's arms unobstructed so she can fight with the sword and shield she is holding. Commenting on the figure, archaeologist Mogens Bo Henriksen said that [...] "there can hardly be any doubt that the figure depicts one of Odin's valkyries {{as we know them}} from the sagas as well as from Swedish picture stones from the time around AD700".|$|E

Four doctors who {{examined}} Mylett's body {{thought she had}} been murdered, but Robert Anderson thought she had accidentally hanged herself on the collar <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> while in a drunken stupor. At Anderson's request Dr Bond examined Mylett's body, and he agreed with Anderson. Commissioner Monro also suspected it was a suicide or natural death as {{there were no signs}} of a struggle.

Nevertheless, the jury returned a verdict of [...] "wilful murder against some person or persons unknown" [...] and the case was added to the Whitechapel file.|$|E
