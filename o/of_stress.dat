5|$|Metrical rhythm {{generally}} involves precise arrangements <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> or syllables into repeated patterns called feet {{within a}} line.

In the classical languages, on the other hand, while the metrical units are similar, vowel length rather than stresses define the meter.

5|$|Concepts {{related to}} force include: thrust, which {{increases}} the velocity of an object; drag, which decreases the velocity of an object; and torque, which produces changes in rotational speed of an object. In an extended body, each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal mechanical stress. Such internal mechanical stresses cause no accelation of that body as the forces balance one another. Pressure, the distribution of many small forces applied over an area of a body, is a simple type <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> that if unbalanced can cause the body to accelerate. Stress usually causes deformation of solid materials, or flow in fluids.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explains}} the type <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> induced in the AA 2014 solid cylindrical specimens when deformed plastically between {{a set of}} rigid dies. The solid cylindrical specimens machined to different height (h) to the diameter (d) ratios namely h/d= 1, h/d= 0. 75 and h/d= 0. 5 were compressed between the two flat cylindrical dies using a 100 ton capacity UTM. These billets were deformed to different strain levels. At each and every stage of the incremental strain, the various elements of the geometry such as contact diameter at the die/billet interface, bulged diameter at the equatorial region and the height after deformation were noted down. The significance of measuring the various elements of the geometry is to predict the value <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> namely axial stress, hoop stress, hydrostatic stress and effective stress which influence the ductility or formability of the material. The stresses induced in the billets were predicted using the empirical equations and a comparison has been made for uni-axial, bi-axial and tri-axial state <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> for different aspect ratios. A notified behavior in the value <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> has been observed for all the aspect ratios and for different state <b>of</b> <b>stresses...</b>|$|R

5|$|Scottie cramp is an {{autosomal}} recessive hereditary disorder which inhibits the dog's ability to walk. It {{is caused by}} a defect in the pathways in the brain that control muscle contraction due to a low level of serotonin in the body. Typically symptoms only show when the particular dog is under some degree <b>of</b> <b>stress.</b> The front legs are pushed out to the side, the back arches and the rear legs overflex, causing the dog to fall should they be moving at speed. The condition is not seizure related, and the dog remains conscious throughout the event, with symptoms abating once the cause of the stress has been removed.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Nicaragua {{earthquake}} was {{the first}} tsunami earthquake to be captured on modern broadband seismic networks. The initial surface wave magnitude was estimated at 7.2.
