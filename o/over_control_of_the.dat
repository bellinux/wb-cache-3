5|$|After {{the release}} of Licence to Kill, legal wrangling <b>over</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series and the James Bond {{character}} resulted in a six-year delay before production of the next Bond film which resulted in Dalton deciding not to return. It is also the final Bond film for actors Robert Brown (as M) and Caroline Bliss (as Moneypenny), screenwriter Richard Maibaum, title designer Maurice Binder, editor John Grover, cinematographer Alec Mills, director and former Bond film editor John Glen, and producer Albert R. Broccoli, although he would later act as a consulting producer for GoldenEye before his death.|$|E

5|$|By May 1940, Castle Bromwich {{had not yet}} {{built its}} first Spitfire, in spite of {{promises}} that the factory would be producing 60 per week starting in April. On 17 May, Minister of Aircraft Production Lord Beaverbrook telephoned Lord Nuffield and manoeuvred him into handing <b>over</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Castle Bromwich plant to his Ministry. Beaverbrook immediately sent in experienced management staff and experienced workers from Supermarine and gave <b>over</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factory to Vickers-Armstrong. Although it would {{take some time to}} resolve the problems, in June 1940, 10 Mk IIs were built; 23 rolled out in July, 37 in August, and 56 in September. By the time production ended at Castle Bromwich in June 1945, a total of 12,129 Spitfires (921 Mk IIs, 4,489 Mk Vs, 5,665 Mk IXs, and 1,054 Mk XVIs) had been built. CBAF {{went on to become the}} largest and most successful plant of its type during the 1939–45 conflict. As the largest Spitfire factory in the UK, by producing a maximum of 320 aircraft per month, it built over half of the approximately 20,000 aircraft of this type.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{appropriated}} {{funds for}} the establishment of a permanent fort in 1891, and the Interior Department allocated land just north of Camp Sheridan for permanent facilities. Camp Sheridan was renamed Fort Yellowstone on May 11, 1891.

5|$|Conwy Castle was {{not well}} {{maintained}} during the early 14th century and by 1321 a survey reported it was poorly equipped, with limited stores and suffering from leaking roofs and rotten timbers. These problems persisted until Edward, the Black Prince, took <b>over</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle in 1343. Sir John Weston, his chamberlain, conducted repairs, building new stone support arches for the great hall {{and other parts of}} the castle. After the death of the Black Prince, however, Conwy fell into neglect again.|$|E

Maximilian's second marriage in 1493 with Bianca Maria Sforza from Milan then got the Habsburgs directly involved in the Italian Wars, clashing again with the French kings <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Duchy <b>of</b> Milan.|$|R

5|$|Haynes asked Fitch {{to observe}} the ailerons through the {{passenger}} cabin windows to see if control inputs were having any effect. Fitch reported back that the ailerons were not moving at all. Nonetheless, the crew continued to manipulate their control columns {{for the remainder of}} the flight, hoping for at least some effect. Haynes then asked Fitch to take <b>over</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> throttles so that Haynes could concentrate on his control column. With one throttle in each hand, Fitch was able to mitigate the phugoid cycle and make rough steering adjustments.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Île Ronde {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} between small French Navy and British Royal Navy squadrons off Île de France, now named Mauritius, in {{the early}} stages of the French Revolutionary Wars. The battle was fought <b>over</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waters around Île de France, which was under blockade from the British squadron as French warships and privateers operating from the island posed a significant threat to vital British trade routes connected to British India and China.|$|E
5|$|The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff at the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Bostock was considered a leading candidate for the position of Chief of the Air Staff in 1942 but was passed over in favour of Air Commodore George Jones, a friend of twenty years. Appointed Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command soon after, Bostock became involved in a bitter and long-running dispute with Jones <b>over</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Air Force in the South West Pacific. Following his retirement from the RAAF in 1946, he became a journalist and later a Federal Member of Parliament.|$|E

The tunnels were closed in 1910, but the groundwater continued {{to be used for}} the prison's gardens. In 1989, oil leaking from nearby tanks contaminated the water. The pollution was eventually cleared by 1996 through bioremediation.|$|E

5|$|The state {{took over}} the {{management}} of the property in 1950, but by the 1980s the visitor facilities were felt to be unsuitable, leading to a three-way partnership being created between the local council, the state agency English Heritage and a local charitable trust to develop the castle. The keep was re-roofed and re-floored in the 1990s with the help of European Union funding. English Heritage took <b>over</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle in 2008 and continues to operate the property as a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|After Lavasani's {{body had}} been recovered, Sir David McNee, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, {{contacted}} the Home Secretary to request approval to hand control of the operation over to the British Army, under the provisions of Military Aid to the Civil Power. Whitelaw relayed the request to Thatcher, {{and the prime minister}} agreed immediately. Thus John Dellow, the ranking police officer at the embassy, signed <b>over</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operation to Lieutenant Colonel Mike Rose at 19:07, authorising Rose to order an assault at his discretion. Meanwhile, the police negotiators began stalling Oan. They offered concessions in order to distract him and prevent him killing further hostages, buying time for the SAS to make its final preparations for the now-inevitable assault.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of Bannockburn, however, Arundel's loyalty began to shift back towards the king. Edward's {{rapprochement}} towards the earl had in fact started earlier, when on 2 November 1313, the king pardoned Arundel's royal debts. The most significant factor in this process though, was the marriage alliance between Arundel and the king's new favourites, the Despensers. Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father Hugh Despenser the elder were gradually taking <b>over</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government, and using their power to enrich themselves. While this alienated most of the nobility, Arundel's situation was different. At some point in 1314–1315, his son Richard was betrothed to Isabel, daughter of Hugh Despenser the Younger. Now that he found himself back in royal favour, Arundel started receiving rewards {{in the form of}} official appointments. In 1317 he was appointed Warden of the Marches of Scotland, and in August 1318, he helped negotiate the Treaty of Leake, which temporarily reconciled the king with Thomas of Lancaster.|$|E
5|$|Echmarcach {{may well}} have {{controlled}} Mann throughout his second reign in Dublin. Silver hoards uncovered on Mann, dated by their coins to the years 1030s1050s, {{may well be the}} by-product of the intense conflict <b>over</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island. There is evidence indicating that, {{at some point in the}} early eleventh centuryperhaps in the 1020s1030sa mint may have developed and functioned on Mann. Coins that appear to have been minted on the island roughly coincide with Echmarcach's rule. These coins are very similar to those produced in Dublin, and may be evidence that Echmarcach attempted to harmonise the coinage utilised within his realm. The production of coins on Mann appears to be evidence of a sophisticated economy in the Isles. In fact, the wealth and sophistication of commerce in Echmarcach's realm could in part explain why the constant struggle for control of Dublin and the Isles was so bitter, and could account for Þórfinnr's apparent presence in the region.|$|E
