This Group appears to have closed for a while, as it was reregistered in 1925, the year when the 2nd and 3rd Canberra Scout Groups were formed.

These data were compiled from four administrative sources that originated from the registers of the Federal Employment Service. 10 The data comprise employment and benefit histories till 1990 and <b>official</b> <b>registrations</b> for job search, periods of unemployment, and participation in active labor market programs till 2000.

25|$|Also, the {{spelling}} of given and surnames, varying previously from author to author, or even entry to entry, was then mostly fixed {{according to the}} official recorded form. Former noble titles appearing in male and female variants were transformed by the Weimar Constitution, article 109, into parts of the surnames in Germany, but a new tradition of gender-specific variants, for <b>official</b> <b>registration,</b> was established for these surnames. This practice was confirmed in a judgement by the Reichsgericht on 10 March 1926.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{there was}} a {{differentiation}} of surnames of women from those of their male siblings (as is still a rule in Czech, Eastern Slavic, or Polish female surnames), widespread in Germany until the 18th century. Thus, in old records, especially church registers on rites de passage, such as baptisms, deaths and marriages etc., women may appear bearing regionally typical female surname variants (like, in South Germany: Peter Huber, but Anna Huberin). With the establishment of general <b>official</b> <b>registration</b> of legal names, this practice was abolished in the 18th and the 19th centuries, depending on the legislation of the respective states.|$|E

At the same time, the forward canopy section was revised again, its sides extended downwards below the rear cockpit rim. Post-World War II, it flew with a Gipsy Major 10 engine.

25|$|By November 1938, Esterházy raised {{additional}} {{demands for}} extension of Hungarian minority rights. The autonomous Slovak government evaluated {{the situation in}} the annexed territory, then did the opposite – binding Hungarian minority rights to the level provided by Hungary which de facto meant their reduction. The applied principle of reciprocity blocked <b>official</b> <b>registration</b> of the SMP and the existence of several Hungarian institutions, as similar organizations were not permitted in Hungary. Moreover, the government banned usage of Hungarian national colors, singing the Hungarian national anthem, did not recognize equality of Hungarian national groups in Bratislava and cancelled a planned office of state secretary for Hungarian minority. The Hungarian government and Esterházy protested against the principle and criticized it as non-constructive.|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} 2072 {{children}} who developed cerebral or spinal cord tumours of {{varying degrees of}} malignancy before 15 years of age has shown that there is equally good representation of fatal and non-fatal cases in <b>official</b> <b>registrations.</b> Attack rates are higher for boys than girls and the prognosis is better for girls than boys. The risk of an early death is negatively correlated with age at diagnosis, {{and the risk of}} a late death shows the opposite relationship. These observations and a relatively high incidence of hindbrain tumours are suggestive of an embryonic origin for most of the cases...|$|R

25|$|Toole {{took the}} {{rejection}} of the book in his intended form as a tremendous personal blow. He eventually ceased work on Dunces and for a time left it atop an armoire in his bedroom. He continued to teach at Dominican where he remained a favorite among the student body with his classes regularly filling up well before <b>official</b> <b>registration.</b> His comedic performances during lectures remained especially popular among students. He attempted to work on another novel which he titled The Conqueror Worm, a reference to death as portrayed in Edgar Allan Poe's poem of the same name, but he found little peace at home. Toole's mother persuaded him to take Dunces to Hodding Carter Jr., who was well known as a reporter and publisher for the Delta Democrat Times in Greenville, Mississippi, and was spending a semester teaching at Tulane. Carter showed little interest in the book, but complimented him on it. The face-to-face rejection Carter dealt Toole drove him further into despair and he became angry with his mother for causing him further embarrassment.|$|E
25|$|With $18.8 million {{spent in}} 2013, Comcast has the seventh largest {{lobbying}} budget of any individual company or {{organization in the}} United States. Comcast employs multiple former US Congressmen as lobbyists. The National Cable & Telecommunications Association, which has multiple Comcast executives on its board, also represents Comcast and other cable companies as the fifth largest lobbying organization in the United States, spending $19.8 million in 2013. Comcast was among the top backers of Barack Obama's presidential runs, with Comcast vice president David Cohen raising over $2.2 million from 2007 to 2012. Cohen {{has been described by}} many sources as influential in the US government, though he is no longer a registered lobbyist, as the time he spends lobbying falls short of the 20% which requires <b>official</b> <b>registration.</b> Comcast's PAC, the Comcast Corporation and NBCUniversal Political Action Committee, is the among the largest PACs in the US, raising about $3.7 million from 2011 to 2012 for the campaigns of various candidates for office in the United States Federal Government. Comcast is also a major backer of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association Political Action Committee, which raised $2.6 million from 2011 to 2012. Comcast spent the most money of any organization in support of the Stop Online Piracy and PROTECT IP bills, spending roughly $5 million to lobby for their passage.|$|E
500|$|All modern Thoroughbreds trace back {{to three}} stallions {{imported}} into England from the Middle East {{in the late}} 17th and early 18th centuries: the Byerley Turk (1680s), the Darley Arabian (1704), and [...] the Godolphin Arabian (1729). [...] Other stallions of oriental breeding were less influential, but still made noteworthy contributions to the breed. These included the Alcock's Arabian, [...] D'Arcy's White Turk, Leedes Arabian, and Curwen's Bay Barb. Another was the Brownlow Turk, who, among other attributes, {{is thought to be}} largely responsible for the gray coat color in Thoroughbreds. In all, about 160 stallions of Oriental breeding have been traced in the historical record as contributing {{to the creation of the}} Thoroughbred. The addition of horses of Eastern bloodlines, whether Arabian, Barb, or Turk, to the native English mares ultimately led to the creation of the General Stud Book (GSB) in 1791 and the practice of <b>official</b> <b>registration</b> of horses. According to Peter Willett, about 50% of the foundation stallions appear to have been of Arabian bloodlines, with the remainder being evenly divided between Turkoman and Barb breeding.|$|E
