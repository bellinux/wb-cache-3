40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the effect of settling error due to finite gain-bandwidth product (GBW) and slew-rate (SR) of <b>opamps</b> in SC Σ ∆ A/D modulators. Based on the theoretical point of view, a new architecture for cascade multibit Σ ∆ A/D modulators is proposed to achieve better performances at low oversampling ratio. The performance improvement is analyzed and compared with traditional cascade architectures. Simulation results show that the proposed Sigma-Delta modulator relaxes the circuit requirement on the GBW of <b>opamps</b> up to twice the sampling frequency. At the same time, the requirement on slew rate is significantly low, {{so that it can be}} automatically satisfied for an adequate settle during its settling phase. Therefore, the proposed architecture is suitable for wideband and low-power applications. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed architecture is also immune to other non-idealities, such as finite DC-gain, capacitor mismatching and non-linear DC-gain.

For example, with a typical operational amplifier the Absolute Maximum Rating for the supply voltage is 36 volts, but a safe operating design supply voltage is 30 volts; if this was supplied as a perfectly balanced +15V and -15V then the theoretical peak output for an ideal rail-to-rail output <b>opamp</b> would be 15 Volts peak (10.6V RMS, 30V peak-to-peak), but a real-world <b>opamp</b> such as the 741 is likely to only be able to drive about 10 volts peak into loads above 2 kilohms, i.e. about 7.1V RMS).|$|E

40|$|The {{quest for}} {{high-performance}} flexible circuits call for scaling {{of the minimum}} feature size in Thin-Film Transistors (TFTs). Although reduced channel lengths can guarantee an improvement in the electrical properties of the devices, proper design rules also {{play a crucial role}} to minimize parasitics when designing fast circuits. In this letter, systematic Computer-Aided Design (CAD) simulations have guided the fabrication of highperformance flexible operational amplifiers (<b>opamps)</b> and logic circuits based on Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide (IGZO) TFTs. In particular, the performance improvements due to the use of an additional third metal layer for the interconnections has been estimated for the first time.

40|$|Abstract- In {{this work}} a new voltage buffer, the drain-follower, {{achieves}} 300 MHz bandwidth with 2 pF load, a dc gain of 0. 993 V/V, 1 mV offset voltage,- 60 dB {{total harmonic distortion}} at 1. 4 Vpp output voltage and 6. 5 mW power dissipation from 5 V supply. A unity-gain buffer switched-capacitor biquad filter has been implemented in 0. 5 µm CMOS technology. The circuit has been sent for fabrication. Simulation results of the biquad filter indicate operation at 100 MHz with 20 mW power consumption from a 5 V supply can be achieved. High-frequency operation of conventional switched-capacitor (SC) filters {{is limited by the}} need for high-gain, large-bandwidth <b>opamps</b> [1]-[3]. While it is possible to realize <b>opamps</b> with the required gain and bandwidth, power consumption becomes an issue [4],[5]. Realizing SC filters with unity-gain buffers rather than <b>opamps</b> may be a solution. A simple unity-gain buffer (UGB) can operate at very high-frequency with competitive power consumption. Several buffers have been characterized to determine their applicability to unity-gain buffer SC filters. The primary metrics are gain, bandwidth and offset voltage. An ideal buffer will have a gain of unity, extremely large bandwidth and no offset voltage. Hspice simulations were performed using realistic CMOS models and load capacitance. It was found that the PMOS SF has the most desirable characteristics. While the PMOS SF suffers from large offset voltage (|Vgs|) and relatively low bandwidth (due to the lower mobility of holes) the other buffers tested exhibit poor gain and linearity primarily due to the body effect. The body effect can be eliminated in the PMOS SF by tying the source to the n-well. Unfortunately the capacitive load introduced by the n-well reduces bandwidth. Bandwidth can be improved by inserting a buffer between the source and n-well which drives the additional load but maintains a constant n-well to source voltage, as shown in Fig...|$|R
