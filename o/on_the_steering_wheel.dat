25|$|This {{new version}} {{featured}} the 147's dual-zone digital climate controller while the interior climate {{could also be}} controlled via an air quality sensor. A different choice of colours were available for the interior, with the option of a two-tone interior very much like that on offer from its European rivals. A wider range of options including xenon lighting, tele-informatics (CONNECT and CONNECT NAV) and a Bose stereo system were available, the stereo system could now also be operated via buttons <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> Also the Selespeed gearbox control system was updated, buttons <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> were replaced by paddle shifters, as seen on the earlier Alfa Romeo 147. In the center console the designers added a multifunctional display with trip computer, fault and service monitor.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} was a Cassini hallmark featuring a special black fabric with copper metal {{buttons on the}} individual adjustable and reclining front seats and on the padded door panels, that was set off by extra thick copper carpeting. Additional copper accents were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> door pulls, and on the instrument panel. Embroidered Cassini medallions were featured on the headrests. The glove compartment door, trunk lid, front fender, and hood featured Cassini's signature.|$|E
25|$|These {{operate in}} an {{identical}} manner as the floor mounted shift lever {{when it is}} placed across the gate in manual mode. The paddle shifters have two distinct advantages: the driver can safely keep both hands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> when using the Manual/tiptronic mode; and the driver can temporarily manually override either of the automatic programmes (D or S), and gain instant manual control of the DSG transmission (within the above described constraints).|$|E
6000|$|He {{had had the}} {{monopoly}} of damage. Mr. Britling, holding <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> had not even been thrown out. [...] "Unless I'm internally injured," [...] he said, [...] "I'm not hurt at all. My liver perhaps--bruised a little...." ...|$|R
50|$|Inside, the 2.5GT tS has {{black leather}} and {{alcantara}} sports seats with red seams and STI label, titanium-finished instrument panels, and STI logo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> speedometer, <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> shift lever, engine start/stop button, and floor mats.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> driver sat <b>on</b> a {{full width}} bench {{seat in a}} {{relatively}} upright position which was said to make length-wise adjustment for different sizes of driver unnecessary, although there was 2.75 in (7 cm) of telescopic adjustment available <b>on</b> <b>the</b> low-set <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
25|$|Despite this, the Aura {{has a few}} criticisms. The Aura's {{interior}} {{has been}} criticized for using cheap materials. Also, the steering wheel {{has been criticized for}} being too big for some drivers and that rear headroom was tight when equipped with the optional sunroof. The Aura was also criticized for being noisy over bumps and its lack of a rear armrest and head restraint, and that the push button controls <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> cannot be operated while holding the wheel. Robert Cumberford of Autombile magazine claimed that the Aura is a good car watered down by GM's cost cutting department.|$|E
25|$|The race {{became part}} of the Formula One World Championship in 1985 and was held at the Adelaide Street Circuit in Adelaide, South Australia, from that year to 1995, before moving to the Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit at Albert Park in Melbourne. in 1996. The winner of the race is {{presented}} with a circular plate, recently named the Jack Brabham trophy named for the three-time winner in a design based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> of one of Brabham's racing cars and a perpetual trophy, the Lex Davison trophy, named for four-time winner and dates back to the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 Shelby GT500 was {{revealed}} by Ford through {{a press release}} on January 1, 2009, prior to a public unveiling at the 2009 North American International Auto Show. Many of the basic design characteristics of the new GT500 are shared {{with that of the}} Mustang and Mustang GT. The GT500 gains the same exterior and interior updates as the 2010 Mustang and Mustang GT. The front fascia is new with larger upper and lower grilles, a unique hood, large fog lights mounted in the lower front fascia (similar to the previous GT500), Shelby's signature cobra badges on the grille, front fenders, and trunk lid medallion (with Shelby lettering over the medallion), 19-inch wheels (18-inch on the convertible model), and a Gurney Flap rear spoiler. Inside the GT500 gains a cobra disc <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> shift ball, and seats with embroidered cobras.|$|E
50|$|The Kabine had a steel unit body. Access to the {{interior}} was by an opening front. In order not to infringe Iso Rivolta's patent used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Isetta, <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> did not hinge outwards with the door to ease passenger access. However, it did feature a reverse gear, unlike some other bubble cars. The fabric sun roof served as an emergency escape hatch should the sole door in front become jammed in a collision.|$|R
2500|$|Models were molded in {{different}} colors, but often painted with actual factory paints, {{a practice that}} {{went back to the}} 1930s. Also, as with the 1964 Pontiac Grand Prix, the roof was cast in [...] "vinyl" [...] black. Script and emblem details were intricately molded into plastic bodies, grilles and wheels. Hoods did not open, there was no engine detail and no interiors on most models in the 1950s. Thus promos without interior or engine detail were called “coaster models” as opposed to kits with more detail. With the development of kits, however, viewing the interior became practical and as important as exterior appearance. Speedometer numbers could be read <b>on</b> <b>the</b> instrument panels. Horn rings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheels</b> were accurately depicted brand by brand.|$|R
5000|$|All T Series models {{used the}} {{familiar}} Windsor V8 Engine renamed [...] "Synergy 5000", but was hand built {{to provide more}} power over the XR8's standard 185 kW and it also feature an engraved plaque with the signature of its builder. The TE50 and TL50 models were equipped with a 200 kW version, whilst the TS50 gained aluminium cylinder heads to produce 220 kW. The TE50 was available with a 5-speed manual or optional 4-speed automatic transmission. This transmission was <b>the</b> only choice <b>on</b> <b>the</b> TS50 and TL50. Along with being combined with traction control, the 4-speed automatic had ESS (Electronic Sports Shift), which was an Australian-production first by providing buttons <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheels</b> allowing for manual gear shifting. Inside, each car featured Momo <b>steering</b> <b>wheels</b> and gear levers.|$|R
25|$|The Model T's {{transmission}} {{was controlled}} with three foot pedals and a lever mounted {{to the road}} side of the driver's seat. The throttle was controlled with a lever <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> The left pedal was used to engage the transmission. With the floor lever in either the mid position or fully forward and the pedal pressed and held forward, the car entered low gear. When held in an intermediate position, the car was in neutral. If the left pedal was released, the Model T entered high gear, but only when the lever was fully forward – in any other position, the pedal would only move up {{as far as the}} central neutral position. This allowed the car to be held in neutral while the driver cranked the engine by hand. The car could thus cruise without the driver having to press any of the pedals.|$|E
25|$|Just {{after finding}} Laurie, Jill is {{killed by a}} scalpel-wielding Michael, who then pursues Laurie through the {{hospital}}. Laurie escapes {{to the parking lot}} and hides in Jimmy's car. Regaining consciousness, Jimmy exits the hospital and gets in the car to seek help, but he falls unconscious <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> horn because of his injuries, alerting Michael to their location. Loomis, Marion, and the marshal get to the hospital just in time to save Laurie. Loomis shoots Michael five more times. As Marion attempts to contact the police, Michael kills the marshal and chases Loomis and Laurie into an operating room. Michael stabs Loomis in the stomach, wounding him, but Laurie shoots Michael in the eyes, blinding him. Loomis and Laurie fill the room with ether and oxygen gas. Loomis orders Laurie to run and sacrifices himself by igniting the gas, which blows up the operating room with him and Michael inside. Michael emerges from the room, engulfed in flames, before he collapses and finally dies. Early the next morning, Laurie is put in an ambulance and driven to safety.|$|E
25|$|The Adaptive Cruise Control {{function}} senses {{the speed}} and pace of vehicles ahead, and can automatically adjust the speed the car is traveling at accordingly to maintain one of four user selectable gaps. Pre-Collision Braking uses the same cameras to monitor {{the activity of the}} vehicles ahead, and alerts the driver visually and audibly. If the driver fails to act, more alerts will be sounded and the car will actively brake itself. According to the IIHS, the Legacy prevented a collision while traveling at 25mph towards a stopped obstacle. When the car was first released for the 2015 model year, Lane Departure with Sway warning was included in the Eyesight package. This function watched the driver's position within the lane lines, and alerted the driver if they were drifting out of the lane (if a turn signal was used, this alert was not activated), with Sway warning notified the driver if they appeared to be unable to stay centered in the lane, suggesting they may be overly drowsy. For the 2016 model year, a Lane Keep Assist was added, which applied steering torque to prevent the driver from drifting from the lane. This function is active above 40 miles an hour. Also standard on all cars with the Eyesight system are adaptive fog lights aid in turns and cornering and is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> degree.|$|E
50|$|The Custom Royal Lancer also {{featured}} a padded dashboard and <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> Lancer emblems <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fenders, <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> hubcaps, foot-operated windshield wipers, dual radio antennas, deluxe side trim, and thick chrome eyebrows. Optional equipment included power windows and brakes, air conditioning, and swivel seats. The Lancer designation was dropped for 1960.|$|R
5000|$|It {{features}} leather sport {{seats in}} [...] "San Remo” microfiber with embossed Pirelli tyre tread pattern down the centre. It also has yellow stitching <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seats, <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and gear shift. There {{is also a}} Pirelli logo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head restraints. The exterior and valences are painted sunflower yellow. Other colours are also available.|$|R
5000|$|As I recovered, I {{realized}} that my whole life {{had been out of}} balance...I had graduated high school at 16, and had been working nonstop since then, first as a waitress, then as a restaurant manager. I had been obsessed by my career, success, and material things. The crash woke me up to the importance of the moment, and doing whatever I could to make a positive impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> future. <b>The</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> in my head, both figuratively and literally, steered me in a new direction in my life.|$|R
500|$|From the inside, the [...] "New Edge" [...] {{interior}} of the AU was discarded in favour of a contemporary style, based upon European designs. Marcus Hotblack, the director of interior design, focused on improving user friendliness. The resulting design was an ergonomically-correct interior command centre, highlighted by the satin-finish centre console. The theme was further extended by the audio and cruise control switches' location <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
500|$|... "Our Song" [...] {{received}} acclaim {{from contemporary}} music critics. Sean Dooley of About.com listed [...] "Our Song" [...] as Swift's fifth best song to date. He identified Swift's [...] "uncanny ability, especially {{at such a}} young age, to write a compelling narrative" [...] as the song's highlight, referencing the opening lines [...] "I was riding shotgun with my hair undone {{in the front seat of}} his car / He's got a one-hand feel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> / The other on my heart." [...] Rob Sheffield of Blender magazine described the track as gem that hit hard. Rick Bell of Country Standard Time said Taylor Swifts best efforts were Swift self-penned song, including [...] "Our Song", which [...] "she sings with stirring conviction." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine said the song [...] "follow time-tested narrative conventions and, more often than not, build to massive pop hooks." [...] Fiona Chua of MTV Asia selected the track as a choice cut from Swift's second studio album, Fearless. Kate Kiefer of Paste magazine recognized the song to be Swift's [...] "first great hit" [...] and believed it became many couples' song. In 2008, [...] "Our Song" [...] was listed as a [...] "Winning Song" [...] by Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI).|$|E
500|$|During a {{visit to}} a closing video store during a DVD sale, Peter decides to buy Road House and, after {{watching}} it, decides to start roundhouse kicking everything in sight including his family. While driving with Brian and using his feet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> Peter crashes into a young woman's car, leading Brian to ensure she is okay. The woman apologizes to Brian, and he asks her out. She accepts, but when he comes to her house to pick her up, her mother Rita says she has just left with somebody else. Brian keeps talking to Rita and finds himself attracted to her. After dating for several weeks, they sneak into the Griffin home late one night, but the family finds out the next morning and ridicules Rita behind her back. [...] Brian attempts to convince the family that Rita is a wonderful, charming woman despite the fact that she's significantly older than he is, and invites her to dinner to prove his point. It doesn't go well: they demand that she reveal her age, and she breaks down and admits that she's 50. Infuriated with the Griffins, Brian goes to console Rita, and proposes to her. Feeling guilty for how they treated him, the Griffins give Brian their blessings.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mobile phone}} {{is placed in}} a cradle {{connected}} to a telephone network unit and operated using <b>the</b> buttons <b>on</b> <b>the</b> multi-function <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> It is controlled by COMAND, a Motorola operating system which also allows SMS messages to be read and edited <b>on</b> <b>the</b> existing dashboard display. [...] There are {{a large number of}} different cradles now available for various phones.|$|R
5000|$|In some modern sports cars, {{the gear}} lever has been {{replaced}} entirely by [...] "paddles", which are a pair of levers, usually operating electrical switches (rather than a mechanical connection to <b>the</b> gearbox), mounted <b>on</b> either side of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> column, where one increments the gears up, and the other down. Formula 1 cars used to hide the gear stick behind <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> within <b>the</b> nose bodywork before the modern practice of mounting the [...] "paddles" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> (removable) <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> itself.|$|R
25|$|Third: See that {{spark control}} lever, {{which is the}} short lever located <b>on</b> top of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right side, is {{back as far as}} {{possible}} toward the driver and <b>the</b> long lever, <b>on</b> top of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> column controlling <b>the</b> carburetor, is pushed forward about one inch from its retarded position.|$|R
2500|$|SVZ: Based on the SV6 plus leather seats, paddle shifts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> Monaro CV8 rims. Available with 3.6-litre [...] Alloytec V6 – {{five-speed}} automatic or six-speed manual ...|$|E
2500|$|Driving gloves {{intended}} {{to improve the}} grip <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> [...] Driving gloves have external seams, open knuckles, open backs, ventilation holes, short cuffs, and wrist snaps. [...] The most luxurious are made from Peccary gloving leather.|$|E
2500|$|The Enzo has a {{semi-automatic}} transmission (also {{known as the}} F1 gearbox) using paddles to control an automated shifting and clutch mechanism, with LED lights <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> telling the driver when to change gears. [...] The gearbox has a shift time of just 150milliseconds. [...] The transmission was a first generation [...] "clutchless" [...] design from the late 1990s, {{and there have been}} complaints about its abrupt shifting.|$|E
2500|$|Standard {{equipment}} {{levels and}} convenience features were increased <b>on</b> <b>the</b> new Spirit compared to previous AMC Gremlins. The DL models featured upgraded trim inside and out, including color-keyed wheel covers, custom bucket seats in corduroy fabric or [...] "sport" [...] vinyl upholstery, wood accents <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dashboard, <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> and floor gearshift knob, and fluorescent-display digital clock. The Limited model included leather seats and trim, air conditioning, AM/FM radio, adjustable <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> dual remote outside mirrors, full length center console with armrest, {{and many more}} features.|$|R
50|$|The VJM02 had {{the option}} to feature a Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS), which allows energy which would {{otherwise}} be wasted while braking to be re-used in set amounts per lap, via a boost button <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driver's <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> energy is stored in either a battery or a flywheel. This {{is the result of}} new rules for the 2009 season. The VJM02 was supposed to use the same system from the McLaren MP4-24, however Force India did not use it during the season.|$|R
50|$|Changes to Civic {{hatchback}} include retuned {{electric power}} steering {{to provide a more}} secure control during higher speeds, front and rear dampers were revised for improving body control, toe and camber of the rear suspension were realigned to improve the hatchback's handling, privacy glass <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower rear window, piano black touches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> number plate surround, tailgate and lower bumper; piano black front bumper, new alloy wheels, darker wheel arch garnishes, white stitching <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seats, <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and knee pad; aluminum inserts around the cup holder, glossy black inserts.|$|R
2500|$|The {{traditional}} mechanical {{shift lever}} {{was replaced by}} a Shift by wire shifter, as introduced in the 2007 E70 X5 and the 2008 LCI update of the E60 5 Series. The LCD and iDrive scroll button <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> became standard equipment. GPS navigation and an [...] widescreen display were included in the Technology and Navigation packages. Other options include heated front seats and split-fold rear seats. Rear headroom, leg room and shoulder room has increased, compared with its E90 predecessor.|$|E
2500|$|A new Plus Sport System is standard. If {{the battery}} {{is more than}} 30 percent charged and the CR-Z is {{traveling}} over 18mph, the driver can press the [...] "S+" [...] button <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> to deliver increased acceleration {{for up to five}} seconds. Manual-transmission versions also receive both a larger clutch and a new lower final drive ratio. EPA-rated fuel economy figures increased by 1 mpg city for CVT equipped models, and 1 mpg highway for those with the six-speed manual transmission.|$|E
2500|$|Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems, a {{regenerative}} braking device designed to recover {{some of the}} vehicle's kinetic energy normally dissipated as heat during braking, were introduced for the 2009 season. The recovered energy can be stored electrically, in a battery or supercapacitor, or mechanically, in a flywheel, {{for use as a}} source of additional accelerative power at the driver's discretion by way of a boost button <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> The regulations limit the additional power to around [...] of 400kJ for six seconds a lap. The systems were not made compulsory, and because of concerns about both limited performance gains and safety implications only four teams opted to use the system during the season.|$|E
5000|$|Inside, the {{dashboard}} is part-trimmed in leather and carbon fibre trim {{and the engine}} start button is located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> multi-function <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> driver is offered Alfa Romeo's [...] "DNA" [...] dynamic control selector, which is placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> centre dashboard.

40|$|Abstract. Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) is {{the study}} and {{modification}} of the noise and vibration characteristics of vehicles, particularly cars and trucks. NVH parameters which consist of noise (unwanted sound), vibration (mechanical oscillation) and harshness (severity or discomfort of noise or vibration) need to be evaluated {{in order to improve}} comfort and safety levels for vehicle occupants. In this paper, NVH study was conducted on Malaysian Armed Forces (MAF) tactical vehicles {{in order to ensure that}} the vehicles meet the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Directive 2002 / 44 /EC. The project aim was to identify the preferable solution that can improve the NVH parameters of the vehicles in accordance to the standard and test protocols. A 4 x 4 Troop Transporter vehicle which carried 8 persons at the rear cabin was used in the NVH testing. The vibration parameters studied are hand arm vibration (HAV), focussing <b>on</b> vibration <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheels</b> of <b>the</b> vehicle, and whole body vibration (WBV), focussing <b>on</b> vibration <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seats. For noise, it was measured at the driver cabin and rear cabin of the vehicles. From the results, the HAV value for driver during idle speed was found to be higher than the others velocity. For WBV, vibration value for passenger 1 in rear cabin was highest compared to the other WBV test points...|$|R
