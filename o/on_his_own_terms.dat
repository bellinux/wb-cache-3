5|$|If Wilde's {{period at}} the helm of the {{magazine}} was a mixed success from an organizational point of view, one can also argue that it played a pivotal role in his development as a writer and facilitated his ascent to fame. Whilst Wilde the journalist supplied articles under the guidance of his editors, Wilde the editor is forced to learn to manipulate the literary marketplace <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{both sides}} wished for a decisive battle that would tip {{the war in}} their favor. However, Lazenby {{believed}} that Mardonius' actions during the Plataea campaign were not consistent with an aggressive policy. He interprets the Persian operations during the prelude not as attempts to force the Allies into battle but as attempts to force the Allies into retreat (which indeed became the case). Mardonius may have felt he had little to gain in battle {{and that he could}} simply wait for the Greek alliance to fall apart (as it had nearly done over the winter). There can be little doubt from Herodotus' account that Mardonius was prepared to accept battle <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> however. Regardless of the exact motives, the initial strategic situation allowed both sides to procrastinate, since food supplies were ample for both armies. Under these conditions, the tactical considerations outweighed the strategic need for action.|$|E
5|$|In 1445, Casimir, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, {{was asked}} to assume the Polish throne vacated upon {{the death of his}} brother Władysław. Casimir was a tough {{negotiator}} and did not accept the Polish nobility's conditions for his election. He finally arrived in Poland and was crowned in 1447 <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> His assumption of the Crown of Poland freed Casimir from the control that the Lithuanian oligarchy had imposed on him; in the Vilnius Privilege of 1447, he declared the Lithuanian nobility to have equal rights with Polish szlachta. In time, Casimir was able to wrest power from Cardinal Oleśnicki and his group. He replaced their influence with a power base built on the younger middle nobility. Casimir was able to resolve a conflict with the pope and the local Church hierarchy over the right to fill vacant bishop positions in his favor.|$|E

5000|$|Goncourt judge Tahar Ben Jelloun said of {{the novel}} [...] "It’s {{important}} to exorcise the unpleasant parts of history through literature, and not through political discourse, which doesn’t help at all. Thanks to fiction, we can probe deep into these problems and touch people’s consciences and hearts." [...] Journalist Jean Birnbaum (b. 1974) echoed that sentiment, praising the book for verbalizing the subconscious feelings of his generation; until Jenni’s novel was published there was no literature to help process the country’s recent military past <b>on</b> <b>his</b> generation's <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> the novel made honest debate possible.|$|R
5|$|The Apostles of the Stars launch {{their first}} {{attack on the}} World Summit, killing the leaders from 20 top nations, causing Chronos to declare war on them. Chronos even notify Train of a new Sweeper bounty on Creed {{in order to gain}} his help, though he resists, {{planning}} to go after him <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> Chronos assassin Jenos Hazard is sent to hire Rinslet to gather information on the Apostles, however, this is really in order to use her as bait to lure Creed out of hiding and force Train to get involved, who was lured to the same area via false Sweeper intel. Jenos and the other two members of the special unit Cerebus launch an assault on Creed's lair, that results in it being turned to rubble, while Train simply rescues Rinslet and leaves. Creed then tries to kill Sven, believing he is holding Train back from joining him, but accidentally shoots Train with a nanomachine-enhanced bullet that has the unplanned effect of reverting his body to that of a child. In order to return Train to normal, Train, Sven and Eve visit nanotechnology expert Dr. Tearju, who is also Eve's creator. While there, the Apostles of the Stars attack to force Tearju to join them in order to grant Creed eternal life through nanomachines, but are defeated by a returned Train who can now fire a railgun shot thanks to the nanomachines. However, Eathes was able to copy Tearju, gaining all of her knowledge, and Train, Sven and Eve finally decide {{to put a stop to}} Creed.|$|E

40|$|In 1964 Searle {{argued against}} the naturalistic fallacy thesis that an ought-statement can {{in fact be}} derived from is-statements. From an {{analysis}} of this argument and of Searle’s social ontology of 1995 – which includes a full-blown theory of institutional facts – I conclude that this argument is unsound <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> (later) <b>terms.</b> The conclusion that can now be drawn from Searle’s argument is that social or institutional obligations are epistemically objective {{even though they are}} observer-dependent. I go on to argue that the strength of such obligations depends on the strength of the underlying collective acceptance, which is a kind of collective intentionality. I also point out that all normativity in Searle’s framework {{can be traced back to}} either individual or collective intentionality. This bars him from providing an account of intention-independent moral facts...|$|R

25|$|On January 27, 1927, Judge Landis cleared Cobb and Speaker of any {{wrongdoing}} because of Leonard's refusal to appear at the hearings. Landis allowed both Cobb and Speaker {{to return to their}} original teams, but each team let them know that they were free agents and could sign with any club they wanted. Speaker signed with the Washington Senators for 1927, and Cobb with the Philadelphia Athletics. Speaker then joined Cobb in Philadelphia for the 1928 season.

He was soon dropped again, replaced by Ridley Jacobs. His career seemed over but he got a surprise recall for the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy in England.

50|$|In a {{relatively}} short period of time, social media software, apps and sites have become another audience-building resource available to artists, allowing them to release music and sell products − without being forced to rely on often reluctant or short-sighted record label executives to do all this for them when they decide get around to it or find the funds. Today’s social media-astute artist is no longer a record label’s product or property as in the past.

30|$|One of {{the other}} pitfalls which needs to be avoided is the {{building}} of a ‘politics of recognition’ through media visibility. Even though the use of the media is also a way to raise awareness among a non-Native public, self-making should not be ‘fixed by the look of another’ and should constantly negotiate the difficulties entangled with the paradox of trying to convince the very structures oppressing indigenous people of their authenticity and of the legitimacy of their claims (Coulthard 2008). Indeed, self-representation and self-making are linked to building one’s identity <b>on</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> But ‘does one actually decide one’s own identity or is it applied from the outside, determined, socially constructed and performed?’ (Smith 2011).|$|R
25|$|The Allies {{stood still}} between March 4 and 6, {{tracking}} the French manoeuvres {{and trying to}} discern Masséna's intentions with certainty. To Wellington the apparent French retreat was itself a welcome relief, and the general opted to wait out events rather than risk compromising his advantage with precipitous actions against the enemy (nor was Wellington eager to try conclusions with a commander as reputed as Masséna, even an apparently beaten Masséna, unless it were <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms).</b> Unbeknownst to the French, however, several Allied detachments (largely Portuguese recruits) had already seized many positions along the Mondego. Consequently, the Allies did not march until {{the morning of the}} 6th, with Wellington directing a circumspect and cautious pursuit of Ney.|$|E
25|$|Rommel {{attempted}} {{to turn the}} left flank of the Eighth Army at the Battle of Alam el Halfa from 31 August 1942. The German/Italian armoured Corps infantry attack was stopped in very heavy fighting. Rommel's forces had to withdraw urgently lest their retreat through the British minefields be cut off. Montgomery was criticised for not counter-attacking the retreating forces immediately, but he felt strongly that his methodical build-up of British forces was not yet ready. A hasty counter-attack risked ruining his strategy for an offensive <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms</b> in late October, planning for which had begun soon after he took command. He was confirmed in the permanent rank of lieutenant-general in mid October.|$|E
25|$|Hood made {{a serious}} {{strategic}} error before the battle. On December 2, {{he sent the}} three brigades of William B. Bate's Division of Cheatham's Corps to attack the Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad between Nashville and Murfreesboro {{as well as the}} Federal garrison in the latter city. Three days later, he sent an additional two brigades of infantry and two divisions of cavalry, all under Forrest's command, to reinforce Bate. Hood believed this diversion would draw Thomas out of the Nashville fortifications, allowing Hood to either defeat Thomas in detail or to seize Nashville by a coup de main once its garrison was depleted. While the railroad between Nashville and Murfreesboro was broken in a number of places, the Murfreesboro garrison drove off the Confederates in the Third Battle of Murfreesboro (also called the Battle of the Cedars) on December 7. Furthermore, Thomas was not fooled by this diversion, and remained in his fortifications until he was ready to attack <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> Bate's Division and one of the two attached infantry brigades returned to Nashville, but Hood had seriously diminished his already outnumbered forces, and he had also deprived his army of its strongest and most mobile unit, Forrest and his cavalry.|$|E
40|$|This article {{cautions}} against underestimating {{the complexity}} of the intersubjective interpretation involved in deliberation between citizens in a democracy. The subjective nature of interpretation potentially sabotages the possibility of truly hearing, or reading, others on their <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> which, in turn, undermines the democratic ideal of basing decisions on the actual will of the interlocutors. Authentic deliberation can in fact only follow on from a ‘good reading’ of the other, based on the actual rather than the interpreted views of the various parties. I argue that literary theory’s long engagement with such interpretive complexity can be employed to illuminate an interpretive stance that would do justice to both deliberation and democracy. In particular, C. S. Lewis’s and Mikhail Bakhtin’s arguments point to a reading of the other that, while acknowledging our subjectivity, also envisions the possibility of engaging with the other <b>on</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> [URL] Science...|$|R
40|$|Two of {{the most}} {{influential}} theories about scientific inference are Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE) and Bayesianism. How are they related? Bas van Fraassen has claimed that IBE and Bayesianism are incompatible rival theories, since any probabilistic version of IBE would violate Bayesian conditionalisation. In response, several authors have defended the view that IBE is compatible with Bayesian updating. They claim that the explanatory considerations in IBE are taken into account by the Bayesian because the Bayesian either does or should make use of them in assigning probabilities (priors and/or likelihoods) to hypotheses. I argue that van Fraassen has not succeeded in establishing that IBE and Bayesianism are incompatible, but that the existing compatibilist response is also not satisfactory. I suggest that a more promising approach to the problem is to investigate whether explanatory considerations are taken into account by a Bayesian who assigns priors and likelihoods <b>on</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> In this case, IBE would emerge from the Bayesian account, rather than being used to constrain priors and likelihoods.

25|$|As {{the son of}} Colley Cibber, one of the theatre's managers, Theophilus became {{involved}} in the management of Drury Lane. In 1723, he became manager of the summer season, and in 1727 became assistant manager during the regular season. In 1732, one of the managers, Barton Booth, sold his share to John Highmore, and another of the managers, Robert Wilks, fell ill and died. Cibber senior became disenchanted by the involvement of Wilks' widow, through her representative John Ellys, in the management of the company. He dropped out of the management and leased his share in the company to his son. Cibber junior took the lead in the management of the theatre during the 1732–33 season, until he fell ill. The actions of Ellys and Highmore in his absence, which appear to have been largely centred on saving or making money, irritated Theophilus and friction grew between them. The other managers approached Cibber senior and offered to buy out his share. Without consulting Theophilus, Colley Cibber sold them his share for 3,000 guineas, and they promptly gave Theophilus his notice. Theophilus led the actors in a walkout and they set themselves up as rival, but informal, company of players in the Haymarket. The Cibbers applied for a letters patent to perform at the Haymarket, but it was refused, and the Drury Lane managers attempted to shut down Cibber by conspiring in the arrest of his leading actor, John Harper, on a charge of vagrancy. Public opinion swung to Theophilus' side, and Harper was released. The Drury Lane managers were defeated, and Theophilus regained control of the company <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E
