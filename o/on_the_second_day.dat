40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{test the}} {{capacity}} of the Logistic CASUS Score <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> postoperative <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> total serum bilirubin dosage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> postoperative <b>day</b> and <b>the</b> extracorporeal circulation time, as possible predictive factors of long-term stay in Intensive Care Unit after cardiac surgery. Methods: Eight-two patients submitted to cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation were selected. The Logistic CASUS Score <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> postoperative <b>day</b> was calculated and bilirubin dosage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> postoperative <b>day</b> was measured. The extracorporeal circulation time was also registered. Patients were divided into two groups: Group A, those who were discharged up to <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> of postoperative care; Group B, those who were discharged after <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> of postoperative care. Results: In this study, 40 cases were listed in Group A and 42 cases in Group B. The mean extracorporeal circulation time was 83. 9 ± 29. 4 min in Group A and 95. 8 ± 29. 31 min in Group B. Extracorporeal circulation time was not significant in this study (P= 0. 0735). The level of P significance of bilirubin dosage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> postoperative <b>day</b> was 0. 0003 and an area under the ROC curve of 0. 708 with a cut-off point at 0. 51 mg/dl was registered. The level of P significance of Logistic CASUS Score <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> postoperative <b>day</b> was 0. 0001 and an area under the ROC curve of 0. 723 with a cut-off point at 0. 40 % was registered. Conclusion: The Logistic CASUS Score <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> postoperative <b>day</b> has shown to be better than <b>the</b> bilirubin dosage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> postoperative <b>day</b> as a predictive tool for calculating the length of stay in intensive care unit during the postoperative care period of patients. Notwithstanding, extracorporeal circulation time has failed to prove itself as an efficient tool to predict an extended length of stay in intensive care unit...|$|R

40|$|Background: It {{is known}} that {{breastfeeding}} offers numerous benefits for the mothers and their babies. In this sense, “Promotion of Breast Milk and Baby Friendly Hospital” initiation was started in 1992 all over the world. Systematically trainings are provided at the baby friendly hospitals {{in order to promote}} breastfeeding and to continue breastfeeding behavior. However, the efficacy of the planned counseling services for breastfeeding provided following the birth at the baby friendly hospitals reduces due to the early discharge. The present research was conducted {{in order to determine the}} effect of counseling provided <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> post partum <b>day</b> through home visits on breastfeeding success. Methods: Design: Randomized-controlled. The research was consisted of 100 women (intervention group= 50, control group= 50) who resided in Çorum Province, Turkey. Women of the intervention group were provided with trainings and counseling related to breastfeeding at the hospital after birth and at home following <b>the</b> discharge (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> postpartum <b>day).</b> <b>The</b> data were collected using Descriptive Data Collection Form used to obtain information about mothers’ characteristics, Breastfeeding Evaluation Forms used to analyze the aspects about breastfeeding and LATCH Breastfeeding Charting System. Results: The mean LATCH scores and LATCH subscale scores of the intervention group were higher <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> postpartum <b>day</b> than those in the control group. Moreover, the rate of babies fed only with breast milk by the women in the intervention group during the last 24 hours was higher than those in the control group.
