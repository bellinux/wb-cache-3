40|$|The {{land rent}} {{is one of}} many factors that {{influences}} the socialization <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> Manifestations <b>of</b> the <b>land</b> rent through the amount of the rent-charge and the price <b>of</b> <b>land</b> are very important for the socialization <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> The large amount of the rent-charge influences negatively the development of social renting and. social purchase <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> In regions where the amount of the rentcharge is large the conditions for the development of social renting are less favourable, because social agricultural holdings have no economic interest for renting. As in these regions, as a rule, the prices <b>of</b> <b>land</b> are also high the conditions for socialization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> by purchase <b>of</b> <b>land</b> from individual owners are not favourable too. This conclusion results from the negative correlation between the social renting and the amount of rent-charge (index of correlation: 0. 21443), and the negative correlation between the social purchase <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and the amount of the rent-charge (index of correlation: 0. 19005). Though the amount of the rent-charge is not identical with the real value <b>of</b> <b>land</b> rent because the first almost entirely depends on the supply and demand 2 ̆ 7 <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> stated correlations indicate that the large amount of the rent-charge negatively influences the socialization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> by renting and purchase <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> The negative influence <b>of</b> the <b>land</b> rent on socialization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> manifests itself also through the negative influence of high prices <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> The correlation between socialization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and the high prices <b>of</b> <b>land</b> is negative (coefficient of correlation- 0. 180041, index: 0. 34380). But the price <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> in conditions <b>of</b> the domination of small peasants’ holdings, is not always identical with the capitalized land rent. It mostly depends on the supply and. demand <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> and therefore it appears that the negative influence of the large amount of the rent-charge on socialization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> through purchase <b>of</b> <b>land</b> is not always sufficiently expressed. In agrarian overpopulated regions the price <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> as a rule, is considerably higher than the capitalized land rent. In our conditions the demand <b>of</b> <b>land</b> in the interpeasants 2 ̆ 7 buying. and selling <b>of</b> <b>land</b> has a tendency of decrease, while the supply <b>of</b> <b>land</b> for sale has the tendency of increase due to the employment of rural population out of their holdings. So the supply <b>of</b> <b>land</b> from individual holdings and the demand <b>of</b> <b>land</b> from social holdings have become the important regulator of prices, especially in grain-growing regions. On the base <b>of</b> the <b>land</b> rent realized by the social holdings economical criteria in socialization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> by purchase <b>of</b> <b>land</b> can be established. The amount of the rent-charge can be a source of means for paying the price <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and can considerably influence not only the price <b>of</b> <b>land</b> but also the orientation of agricultural organizations towards purchase <b>of</b> more fertile <b>land</b> which can bring the larger land rent...|$|R

Second, approaches to separation (division) <b>of</b> <b>land</b> associated with the peculiarities of the functions that the earth takes in society, the selected criteria for the classification <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> which in turn can not be absolute and uniform for all occasions.

In order to attain the most points from the style judges, athletes strive for a 'Telemark' landing: instead <b>of</b> <b>landing</b> with simply both feet together (a 'two-footed' landing), one foot is planted clearly {{in front of the}} other (without sliding the skis), both feet held no more than four ski widths' apart, and the body held stable with a straight back and arms outstretched. This pose must be maintained until the 'outrun' – a line at the very end of the hill, where the slope has fully flattened out – is reached. The exact placement <b>of</b> <b>landing</b> is measured between the athlete's front and back feet. Failing to make a Telemark landing results in a loss of style points. Considerably more points are lost if a landing fails before the outrun line, such as falling over or touching the ground with any part of the body except the feet. However, when the hill begins to flatten out, it becomes increasingly difficult to make a Telemark landing.|$|E
