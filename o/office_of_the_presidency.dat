5|$|The Republic of Belarus {{was formed}} in 1991 shortly after declaring itself {{independent}} of the Soviet Union. Under {{the government of the}} Byelorussian SSR, the de facto leader of the Soviet Republic was the first secretaries of the Communist Party of Byelorussia, the only legal party in Soviet Belarus. From independence until passage of the Constitution in 1994, the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet was the head of state and the Prime Minister as the head of government. When the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> was created, the role of the prime minister was reduced to assisting the president and resulted in the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet, along with its Chairman, in 1996.|$|E

After Harriet Beecher Stowe (who served as president from 1859 to 1860), she was the second woman to hold the office. Rose Wilder was succeeded by Ayn Rand, who became the third woman to hold the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ak Saray was {{originally}} {{designed as a}} new office for the Prime Minister. However, upon assuming the presidency, Erdoğan announced that the palace would become the new Presidential Palace, while the Çankaya Köşkü will {{be used by the}} Prime Minister instead. The move was seen as a historic change since the Çankaya Köşkü had been used as the iconic <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> ever since its inception. The Ak Saray has almost 1,000 rooms and cost $350million (€270million), leading to huge criticism at a time when mining accidents and workers' rights had been dominating the agenda.|$|E

Neil Smith, in which the United States becomes a Libertarian State after a successful Whiskey Rebellion and the overthrowing execution of George Washington by firing squad for treason in 1794, Osceola served as the ninth President of the North American Confederacy from 1842 to 1848. He was the second Native American to hold the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency,</b> with the first being Sequoyah Guess, who served from 1840 until his death in a battle in 1842.

25|$|President Taylor died on July 9, {{resulting}} in Millard Fillmore of New York, his vice president, taking the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b> Taylor had opposed the Compromise, but Fillmore supported it. Taylor's cabinet, knowing this, resigned soon after. Webster {{was once again}} appointed Secretary of State, and he took office on July 23. With the Compromise unable to pass Congress as a whole, the parts were divided up and passed through separately, each receiving the support of moderates and partisans on either sides, with the votes of partisans {{on the other side}} being overruled. The bills were then signed into law by President Fillmore.|$|E
25|$|Women in Kosovo {{are women}} who live in or are from the Republic of Kosovo. As {{citizens}} of a post-war nation, some Kosovar (or Kosovan) women have become participants {{in the process of}} peace-building and establishing pro-gender equality in Kosovo's rehabilitation process. Women in Kosovo have also become active in politics and law enforcement in the Republic of Kosovo. An example of which is the election of Atifete Jahjaga as the fourth President of Kosovo, and as such she became the first female, the first non-partisan candidate, and the youngest to be elected to the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> in the country. Before becoming president, she served as Deputy Director of the Kosovo Police, holding the rank of Major general, the highest among women in Southeastern Europe.|$|E

2500|$|On 3 February, Zuma responded, {{confirming}} {{that the child}} was his, and that he had paid inhlawulo, acknowledging paternity. He protested <b>the</b> publishing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child's name, saying it was illegal exploitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. He denied that the incident had relevance to the government's AIDS programme (which promotes marital fidelity as a mechanism for preventing the disease), and appealed for privacy. On 6 February, Zuma said he [...] "deeply regretted the pain that he caused to his family, the ANC, the alliance and South Africans in general."

25|$|Despite {{being placed}} in a {{position}} to shape the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> via precedent, Hyde by and large opted for a quiet, conservative interpretation of the office. His age and health obligated him to schedule periods of rest throughout his days, and his lack of political experience caused him to defer to his advisers on questions of policy and discretionary powers, especially to his Secretary, Michael McDunphy. On 13 November 1938, just months after Hyde's inauguration, Hyde attended an international soccer match between Ireland and Poland at Dalymount Park in Dublin. This was seen as breaching the GAA's ban on 'foreign games' and he was subsequently removed as patron of the GAA, an honour he had held since 1902.|$|E

500|$|Because of {{his short}} tenure, Taylor is not {{considered}} to have strongly influenced the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidency</b> or the United States. [...] Some historians believe that Taylor was too inexperienced with politics, {{at a time when}} officials needed close ties with political operatives. Despite his shortcomings, the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty affecting relations with Great Britain in Central America is [...] "recognized as an important step in scaling down the nation's commitment to Manifest Destiny as a policy." [...] While historical rankings of Presidents of the United States have generally placed Taylor in the bottom quarter of chief executives, most surveys tend to rank him as the most effective of the four Presidents from the Whig Party.|$|E

2500|$|In 1800, Jefferson {{was elected}} as President of the United States over Adams. He won more electoral votes than Adams, aided by {{southern}} power. The Constitution {{provided for the}} counting of slaves as 3/5ths of their total population, {{to be added to}} a state's total population for purposes of apportionment and the electoral college. [...] States with large slave populations, therefore, gained greater representation even though the number of voting citizens was smaller than that of other states. It was only due to this population advantage that Jefferson won the election. This advantage also aided southern states in their Congressional apportionment; thus, the planter class held disproportionate power nationally for decades, and southerners dominated the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> well into the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|Upon the {{announcement}} of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's candidacy, the CHP, LDP and MHP contested his refusal to resign as Prime Minister during the campaign. The case {{was taken to the}} Supreme Electoral Council by both the MHP and Mahmut Tanal, a CHP MP from İstanbul on 9 July. In a press statement, Tanal also attributed the case to the alleged incompatibility of Erdoğan's ideologies and the history of his premiership to the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidency</b> and referred to the 2008 judicial verdict which curbed the AKP's state funding due to the [...] "violations of democratic and secular principles."

2500|$|Also in {{that same}} year, on the Avenue de l'Observatoire in Paris, Mitterrand claimed to have escaped an assassin's bullet by diving behind a hedge, in {{what became known as}} the Observatory Affair. The {{incident}} brought him a great deal of publicity, initially boosting his political ambitions. Some of his critics claimed, however, that he had staged the incident himself, resulting in a backlash against Mitterrand. He later said he had earlier been warned by right-wing deputy Pesquet that he was the target of an Algérie française death squad and accused Prime Minister Michel Debré of being its instigator. Before his death, Pesquet claimed that Mitterrand had set up a fake attempt on his life. Prosecution was initiated against Mitterrand but was later dropped. Nonetheless, the Observatory Affair cast a lasting shadow over Mitterrand's reputation. Years later in 1965, when Mitterrand emerged as the challenger to de Gaulle in the second round of the presidential elections, de Gaulle was urged by an aide to use the Observatory Affair to discredit his opponent. [...] "No, and don't insist" [...] was the General's response, [...] "It would be wrong to demean the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidency,</b> since one day he [...] may have the job." ...|$|E
