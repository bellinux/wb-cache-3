5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system of}} Mortal Kombat II is an improved version <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>from</b> the original Mortal Kombat. There are several changes in standard moves: a crouching punch and turnaround kick are added, {{low and high}} kicks have greater differentiation (be they crouching or standing up), the roundhouse kick are made more powerful (knocking an opponent across the screen, like the game's uppercut), and {{it is easier to}} perform a combo due to reduced recovery times for attacks. Returning characters also gained new special moves, including some to be used in mid-air, and the game plays almost twice as fast as the original. However, all playable characters in the game still share most generic attributes (such as power and jump height) and all normal moves are also the same between each character.|$|E

Murray remained President for two terms, until 1955. In her 1954 presidential address, [...] "England as a Field for Folklore Research", she lamented what she saw as the English people's disinterest in their own folklore in favour <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>from</b> other nations. For the autumn 1961 issue of Folklore, the society published a festschrift to Murray to commemorate her 98th birthday. The issue contained contributions from various scholars paying tribute to her – with papers dealing with archaeology, fairies, Near Eastern religious symbols, Greek folk songs – but notably not about witchcraft, potentially because no other folklorists were willing to defend her witch-cult theory.|$|E

500|$|With {{liability}} established, {{the court}} then recommended an amount for the damages {{to be paid}} by Harrison and Apple to Bright Tunes, which Owen totalled at $1,599,987 – amounting to three-quarters of the royalty revenue raised in North America from [...] "My Sweet Lord", {{as well as a}} significant proportion <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>from</b> the All Things Must Pass album. This figure has been considered over-harsh and unrealistic by some observers, since it both underplayed the unique elements of Harrison's recording – the universal spiritual message of its lyrics, the signature guitar hook, and its production – and ignored the critical acclaim his album received in its own right. Elliot Huntley observes: [...] "People don't usually hear a single and then automatically go and buy an expensive boxed-set triple album on the off-chance." [...] The award factored in the royalty revenue raised from [...] "My Sweet Lord"'s inclusion on the recent Best of George Harrison compilation, though at a more moderate percentage than for the 1970 album.|$|E

2500|$|The Moke's {{construction}} is simple.

These are connected by the floor pan, the firewall and a sturdy lateral torque box that runs under the front seats and stiffens the body in torsion. The left-hand pontoon contains the fuel tank; the right-hand has a compartment for the battery and a small lockable storage area. The 1972 [...] "Moke, Special Export", commonly referred to as a [...] "Californian" [...] Moke, has an Austin Sprite/MG Midget type fuel tank fitted beneath the rear floor area to meet the American FMVSS safety requirements of the time. Standard Mokes of the same period and later Californian Mokes use the conventional tank mounted in the left sidebox. Later Portuguese Mokes have additional lockable storage space at the rear of the vehicle. The optional cloth canopy has plastic side windows, and is held up by a thin tubular structure that can easily be removed when not needed. In later versions this was replaced with a more solid roll cage. The windscreen can easily be unbolted and removed if not needed. There are just three curved panels in the Moke, the bonnet, the firewall and the floor, each of which is only curved in one direction. This makes it relatively straightforward to reproduce and replace Moke body components without access to sophisticated machine tools.|$|E
