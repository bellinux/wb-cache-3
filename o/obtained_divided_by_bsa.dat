50|$|The most {{straightforward}} way {{to quantify}} fairly uniform fouling is by stating the average deposit surface loading, i.e., kg of deposit per m² of surface area. The fouling rate {{will then be}} expressed in kg/m²s, and it is <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> <b>dividing</b> the deposit surface loading by the effective operating time. The normalized fouling rate (also in kg/m²s) will additionally account for the concentration of the foulant in the process fluid (kg/kg) during preceding operations, and is useful for comparison of fouling rates between different systems. It is <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> <b>dividing</b> the fouling rate by the foulant concentration.

Thus, noninvasive quantitation of rat CBF could enhance the repeatable CBF assessment without the physiological damage due to arterial cannulation and blood sampling.|$|R
