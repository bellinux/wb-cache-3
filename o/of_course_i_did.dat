2500|$|Youzhny {{was born}} on 25 June 1982 to Mikhail, a Soviet army colonel and Lubov, a {{professional}} tennis player. 25 June is also his father's birthday. His father sacrificed {{his career in the}} Soviet army to steer Youzhny and his older brother Andrei into becoming tennis players. It was because of his father that Boris Sobkin became his coach. At 13, he was a ballboy for a Russia â€“ United States Davis Cup final in Moscow. Youzhny's father was recommended that Mikhail and his brother should join the tennis club Spartak Club if they wanted to become professional players. Mikhail and Andrei had to travel on an underground metro train and then on two buses to reach their destination, taking well over an hour to reach the club. His mother had to take a part-time job to pay for their club membership fees. At Spartak Club, Youzhny, along with many others his age, would watch Andrei Chesnokov, a former top-10 player, practice for hours. However, his parents had difficulty finding a good coach for Mikhail and Andrei. According to Mikhail, [...] "It was not so easy. In the beginning me and Andrei would watch how coaches were working with students. Then we would make our own drills with a bag of old balls that we collected." [...] Remembering Youzhny's early years, Sobkin said, [...] "Mischa and Andrei were practising together all the time without [...] coach". Sobkin continued: [...] "In the beginning, Mischa is all the time breaking racquets and crying. Not so many coaches want to work with boy with strong character like this. So, they would practise on one court for 15 minutes and then comes a member so they must leave court immediately and move to another court. Ten minutes maybe 20 minutes later comes another member and like this all day. There was something in Mischa's eyes, a sparkle, maybe, I don't know. Sometimes the eyes tells more than parents. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see Mischa is Top 10 player then. But I could see he had something special." ...|$|E

60|$|HARRY. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> When I {{heard someone}} {{shouting}} in English {{the first thing}} I thought of was George.|$|E
60|$|HOTCHKISS. I {{should think}} it quite likely, but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> know.|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not wish}} to be sick: only it looks such {{beautiful}} weather.|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> will <b>do</b> it, and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> will <b>do</b> it for {{the love}} of you and Procter. You can give me my brief, and we can speak about its details. Once again, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> will <b>do</b> it, and with all my heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{spoke of}} a lot of things which, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand," [...] he said. [...] "For instance, there was Ulric. Who was he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} her name, {{and she is}} not very large; but I brought her down the shoot with such {{violence}} that--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But how did he--how is it he {{went out}} to fight, Doctor? I could hardly believe it when I was told, though <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not say so." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY. Well, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> But what <b>I</b> mean is {{a certain}} strong {{simplicity}} about you.|$|R
60|$|MRS WHITEFIELD. Why, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> What queer {{things you}} say, Jack! We can't help loving our own blood relations.|$|R
60|$|MRS. ERLYNNE. [Laughing.] <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> You'll {{carry it}} so gracefully. You would carry off {{anything}} gracefully, dear Lord Augustus.|$|R
60|$|After the {{conversation}} which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir Henry {{put on his}} hat and prepared to go out. As a matter <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the same.|$|E
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not--I {{had never}} heard of him before; but the old lady seemed to regard his {{existence}} as a universally understood fact, with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did care," [...] I replied, [...] "in {{fact it was}} awkward not to know it; but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not want}} to--interfere in any way with the rules of your establishment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well now, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> It's terrible lonesome downstairs without you. Just go {{and smooth}} things over--that's a good girl." ...|$|R
60|$|HORNBLOWER. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> told ye I {{was a bad}} man to be up against. Perhaps ye'll {{believe me}} now.|$|R
60|$|THE GENERAL [impatiently] Oh, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> {{mean that}} you used those words. But that was the meaning {{and the spirit of}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "As I came close, I {{could make}} {{out that there was}} someone behind the bars, but I could not see who it was. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not come {{straight}} to the spot, but went about promiscuously.|$|E
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not read. How could I? Nor did I sleep. My mind ran on, and on, and {{not until}} the steward brought my coffee, shortly before five, did I sink into my first doze.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do regret him in one way, <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> like it very much; but I don't {{think it}} nice, when {{much has been}} done for me, to say that I want to have more done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never said}} a word about her not meeting him. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish that any meeting should be {{contrived}} between them." ...|$|R
6000|$|VOICE. (Mockingly.) <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Who {{does not}} know {{the man who was}} so cruel to his wife--almost the only one he ever had? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> {{really and}} truly; {{and if it}} is to come to pass, it is time to take measures. Don't you see, Margaret?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon, dear Voltaire, this {{definition}} of the French; at worst, it is only of those in Strasburg I speak. To scrape acquaintance, I had to invite some Officers on our arrival, whom <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're horribly logical," [...] Barbara rejoined with a twinkle. [...] "When {{we started}} he didn't know I {{ought not to}} have gone. Mr. Lister is not like you; he's very obvious. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> know, but I went!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, father, if {{you wish}} to hear," [...] {{answered}} Rachel, [...] "Mr. Ishmael, or Mr. Smith as you call him, has been asking me to marry him, and when I refused, as <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> behaved very unpleasantly." ...|$|E
60|$|FRANK. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Ever so much better. Vivvums mustn't lecture: {{her little}} boy's incorrigible. [He {{attempts}} {{to take her}} face caressingly in his hands].|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I don't--but for Manfredi's sake, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> But for his sake {{more than}} my own, I admit. And I think he knows it." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. G. Want to know! <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do!</b> <b>I</b> can't have {{my husband}} cut to pieces in this way. How did it come? Was it an accident? Tell me, Pip.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} girl, with her unsparing honesty, [...] "if you {{had given me}} any hint, I would not have told for the world. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not think--a girl wouldn't--of the effect it {{would have on the}} property." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{understand}} then {{that this was}} an allusion to her supposed experience of the stricken Pidger; but I saw, from the gravity with which Miss Clarissa nodded her head, that great weight was attached to these words.|$|E
60|$|MRS. JONES. [In {{her quiet}} voice, {{still out of}} breath, her hand upon her breast.] <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not take it, sir. I never have taken {{anything}} that {{did n't belong to}} me; and of course I know nothing about it.|$|E
6000|$|HE, {{taking her}} in his arms: [...] "Forgive you? <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> But you must change this room at once, Ethel; you see you hear {{everything}} on the other side, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Silly! <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> when <b>I</b> {{can manage}} it. For drives, rather. Aunt Lora is rather against his walking {{much in the}} city. He might so easily catch something, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--I suppose--I don't know--yes, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do!</b> What {{a stupid}} ass I am. Luke told me {{himself that he}} was going to see his uncle at the Something Club in Shaftesbury Avenue." ...|$|R
