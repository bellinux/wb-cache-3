5|$|A {{man named}} John Plummer {{purchased}} {{the land that}} was Brook Farm in 1849 before selling it six years later to James Freeman Clarke, who intended to establish another community there. Instead, Clarke <b>offered</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War and the Second Massachusetts Regiment used it for training as Camp Andrew.|$|E
5|$|However, the King did {{not want}} the house himself, and he <b>offered</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his heir-apparent, Beatrice's nephew George, who declined, objecting to the high cost of maintenance. Edward {{subsequently}} extended the grounds of Beatrice's home, Osborne Cottage, to compensate her for the impending loss of her privacy. Shortly afterwards, the King declared to Arthur Balfour, the Prime Minister, that the main house would go to the nation as a gift. An exception was made for the private apartments, which were closed to all but the royal family members, who made it a shrine to their mother's memory.|$|E
5|$|In 1562 the First War of Religion {{started in}} France, and Elizabeth was under {{pressure}} from her Protestant councillors to help the Huguenots. These were in possession of Le Havre, which was besieged by the Catholic Duke of Guise, and <b>offered</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the English in return for military helplater, they promised, they would exchange it for Calais, which England had lost to France only in 1558. Elizabeth agreed to send 6,000 men to garrison Le Havre. Ambrose Dudley was chosen to lead the expedition in place of Robert Dudley, whom Elizabeth would not let go despite his strong desire to do so.|$|E

A female person in the position of a remainderman is also termed a remainderman. For instance in a will chattels are left to one person, who can then <b>offer</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a second person, who can then <b>offer</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a third person who can then <b>it</b> <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> the last person who is referred to as [...] "the remainderman".|$|R

5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans prized saffron as a perfume or {{deodoriser}} {{and scattered}} it about their public spaces: royal halls, courts, and amphitheatres alike. When Nero entered Rome they spread saffron along the streets; wealthy Romans partook of daily saffron baths. They {{used it as}} mascara, stirred saffron threads into their wines, cast it aloft in their halls and streets as a potpourri, and <b>offered</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> their deities. Roman colonists took saffron {{with them when they}} settled in southern Roman Gaul, where it was extensively cultivated until the AD 271 barbarian invasion of Italy. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th-century Moors or with the Avignon Papacy in the 14th century.|$|E
5|$|As {{the end of}} his Northwestern career {{approached}} in November 1963, Parseghian called Father Edmund Joyce, the vice president and chairman of the athletics board at Notre Dame, a Catholic university near South Bend, Indiana. He asked whether Hugh Devore, who was then interim head football coach, was going to be given the job on a longer-term basis. When Joyce said the university was searching for a new coach, Parseghian expressed interest in the job. Joyce did not immediately seem warm to the idea, however, and Parseghian explored an offer to coach at the University of Miami, where his old friend Andy Gustafson had been promoted from head coach to athletic director. Notre Dame was also considering Dan Devine for its coaching job, but ultimately <b>offered</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Parseghian. Parseghian waffled at first, recalling his father's dislike of Catholics who had {{played a role in the}} Armenian deportations, but accepted in December and was given a salary of about $20,000 a year ($ today).|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{sought to}} run a more {{efficient}} and accountable government than his predecessors. His Cabinet members implemented an early system of civil service examinations which was a forerunner to the Pendleton Act passed three decades later. The Interior Department was reformed by Secretary Robert McClelland, who systematized its operations, expanded the use of paper records, and pursued fraud. Another of Pierce's reforms was to expand {{the role of the}} U.S. attorney general in appointing federal judges and attorneys, which was an important step in the eventual development of the Justice Department. There was a vacancy on the Supreme Court—Fillmore, having failed to get Senate confirmation for his nominees, had <b>offered</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> newly elected Louisiana Senator Judah P. Benjamin, who had declined. Pierce also offered the seat to Benjamin, and when the Louisianan persisted in his refusal, nominated instead John Archibald Campbell, an advocate of states' rights; this would be Pierce's only Supreme Court appointment.|$|E

5|$|Quatermass {{was played}} by the {{experienced}} Reginald Tate, who had appeared in various films, including The Way Ahead (1944). He died two years later, while preparing to take {{the role of the}} Professor again in Quatermass II. Tate was the second choice for the part; Cartier had previously <b>offered</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> André Morell, who declined the role. (Morell did later play Quatermass in the third instalment of the series, Quatermass and the Pit.) Victor Carroon was played by Scottish actor Duncan Lamont, who later appeared in the film Mutiny on the Bounty (1962), and as a different character in the film adaptation of Quatermass and the Pit (1967). He enjoyed working on The Quatermass Experiment so much that, although he was not required for the final episode, he went to Alexandra Palace to lend moral support. While there, he helped Kneale and Kerr to prepare their 'monster' prop.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} {{was at first}} housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job. He decided, more as a hobby than a job, {{to put it on}} public display in Reykjavík and was awarded a grant from the city council of ISK 200,000 to support the opening of a museum in August 1997. By 2003, it was attracting 5,200 visitors a year, of which 4,200 were from abroad. He put the museum up for sale in 2003, but also <b>offered</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the city of Reykjavík as a gift. However, he was unsuccessful in obtaining financial support from the state or city. When he retired in 2004, he could no longer afford the rent on the museum's premises.|$|E
5|$|William {{called a}} Scottish Convention, which convened on 14 March in Edinburgh. It was {{dominated}} by the Presbyterians. There was a faction that supported James, including many episcopalians, but these were divided by James' attempts to achieve tolerance for Roman Catholics. A letter from James, received on 16 March, contained a threat to punish all who rebelled against him and declaring the assembly illegal, resulted in his followers to abandon the Convention, leaving the Williamites dominant. On 4 April the Convention formulated the Claim of Right and the Articles of Grievances. These suggested that James had forfeited the crown by his actions (in contrast to England, which relied on the legal fiction of an abdication) and <b>offered</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> William and Mary, which William accepted, along with limitations on royal power. On 11 May William and Mary accepted the Crown of Scotland as co-regents, as William II and Mary II. The final settlement, completed by William's Second parliament in 1690, restored Presbyterianism and abolished the bishops, who had generally supported James. Remaining ministers outed in 1662 were restored. The General Assembly of 1692 refused to reinstate even those Episcopalian ministers who pledged to accept Presbyterianism. However, the King issued two acts of indulgences in 1693 and 1695, allowing those who accepted him as king {{to return to the}} church and around a hundred took advantage of the offer. All but the hardened Jacobites would be given toleration in 1707, leaving only a small remnant of Jacobite episcopalians.|$|E

25|$|Butthole Surfers weren't under {{contract}} to any record label when they recorded this album.

This, combined with questions the group had regarding Alternative Tentacles' handling of royalties from Butthole Surfers and Live PCPPEP, resulted in the album ultimately being released on Touch and Go.|$|E

25|$|Priestley {{found that}} water treated {{in this manner}} had a {{pleasant}} taste, and he <b>offered</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his friends as a refreshing drink. In 1772, Priestley published a paper entitled Impregnating Water with Fixed Air in which he describes dripping oil of vitriol (or sulfuric acid {{as it is now}} called) onto chalk to produce carbon dioxide gas, and encouraging the gas to dissolve into an agitated bowl of water.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} the Volk Field Combat Readiness Training Center (CRTC) {{can be traced back}} to 1888 when the state {{adjutant}} general, General Chandler Chapman, purchased a site for a rifle range and <b>offered</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the state for a camp. In 1889 the state legislature authorized the governor to purchase land near the site for a permanent training site to include a dedicated pistol, rifle, and artillery training range for the Wisconsin National Guard.|$|E

25|$|Haridasa Thakur in Gaudiya Vaishnavism is {{believed}} to be a combined incarnation of Brahma Mahatapa, the son of Richika Muni and Prahlada.

His father then cursed him to become a mleccha in his next life. He was thus born as Haridasa, a great devotee.|$|E
25|$|During 1960, several leading Soviet {{directors}} proposed {{themselves to}} head the project, including Mikhail Romm and Sergei Gerasimov. But soon, the only viable candidate remaining was Ivan Pyryev. As his selection to the role seemed secure, several officials in the Ministry of Culture <b>offered</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> forty-year-old Sergei Bondarchuk, who had completed his directorial debut, Destiny of a Man, in 1959. Bondarchuk had not sought out the position {{and did not know}} of the proposal until a letter from the Ministry reached him, but he chose to accept it and contend with Pyryev.|$|E
