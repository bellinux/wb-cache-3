5|$|A lattice gas {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed {{to simulate the}} motion of particles in a fluid or an ideal gas. In such a system, gas particles move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other particles. Lattice gas automata simplify these models by only allowing a constant number of velocities (typically, only one speed and either four <b>or</b> <b>six</b> directions of motion) and by simplifying the types of collision that are possible.|$|E

5|$|A {{study showed}} that high levels of {{nutrients}} used in farming and ranching activities fuel parasite infections that have caused frog deformities in ponds and lakes across North America. The study showed increased levels of nitrogen and phosphorus cause sharp hikes in the abundance of trematodes, and that the parasites subsequently form cysts in the developing limbs of tadpoles causing missing limbs, extra limbs and other severe malformations including five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> extra or even no limbs.|$|E
5|$|After mating in August or September, {{the female}} katipo {{produces}} five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> egg sacs in November or December.

5|$|Besides Majungasaurus, fossil taxa {{recovered}} from the Maevarano include fish, frogs, lizards, snakes, seven distinct species of crocodylomorphs, five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> species of mammals, Vorona and several other birds, the possibly flighted dromaeosaurid Rahonavis, the noasaurid Masiakasaurus and two titanosaurian sauropods, including Rapetosaurus. Majungasaurus {{was by far the}} largest carnivore and probably the dominant predator on land, although large crocodylomorphs like Mahajangasuchus and Trematochampsa might have competed with it closer to water.|$|E
5|$|During April 6, 80 SAMs were {{launched}} by the NVA {{in the area around}} Hambleton. It was estimated that Hambleton and Clark {{were in the midst of}} five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> NVA battalions.

5|$|Plant Hybridization is more commonplace {{compared}} to animal hybridization. Many crop species are hybrids, including notably the polyploid wheats: some have {{four sets of}} chromosomes (tetraploid) <b>or</b> <b>six</b> (hexaploid), while other wheat species have (like most eukaryotic organisms) two sets (diploid), so hybridization events likely involved the doubling of chromosome sets, causing immediate genetic isolation.|$|E
