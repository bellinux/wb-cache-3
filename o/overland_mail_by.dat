50|$|A {{post office}} was {{established}} at the reservation in September 1858, but it was moved in 1859 to Sinks of Tejon Station, one of the stagecoach stations of the Butterfield <b>Overland</b> <b>Mail.</b> <b>By</b> 1858, {{nearly all of the}} remaining inhabitants were living in houses. Several families were raising livestock, and the women had learned to make American style clothing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{town was}} started in 1855, {{at the head of}} {{navigation}} on Fresno Slough. A pier was built to accommodate flatboats and barges that could make it up the shallow slough. Warehouses, houses, and the Casa Blanca Hotel were built. In 1858, it became a station on the Butterfield <b>Overland</b> <b>Mail.</b> <b>By</b> 1860, the telegraph line from San Francisco arrived. Plans for a much larger town were contemplated but the Butterfeild line closed in early 1861, the Great Flood of 1862 did great damage and the City was practically abandoned by 1865. A post office operated at Fresno City from 1860 to 1863. [...] Today there are no traces of it left.|$|E
50|$|Wells Fargo's {{involvement}} in Overland Mail {{led to its}} participation in the Pony Express {{in the last six}} of the express's 18 months of existence. Russell, Majors and Waddell launched the privately owned and operated Pony Express. By the end of 1860, the Pony Express was in deep financial trouble; its fees did not cover its costs and, without government subsidies and lucrative mail contracts, it could not make up the difference. After <b>Overland</b> <b>Mail,</b> <b>by</b> then controlled by Wells Fargo, was awarded a $1 million government contract in early 1861 to provide daily mail service over a central route (the American Civil War had forced the discontinuation of the southern line), Wells Fargo took over the western portion of the Pony Express route from Salt Lake City, Utah to San Francisco. Russell, Majors & Waddell continued to operate the eastern leg from Salt Lake City to St. Joseph, Missouri, under subcontract.|$|E
50|$|Simpson Springs was {{established}} as an <b>Overland</b> <b>Mail</b> station <b>by</b> George Chorpenning for mule train connection between Salt Lake and Sacramento. It later {{became an important}} Pony Express, Overland Stage, and later, Wells Fargo stations on the trail through Utah desert. The station was discontinued after completion of the first Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. It continued {{to be used for}} local freight between Fairfield and Ibapah into the 1890s.|$|R
50|$|Special {{stationery}} on thin {{sheets of}} paper, called Air Letter Cards {{were available in}} Iraq as early as 1933. The sheets were folded {{to the size of}} the blue border, and gummed flaps were used to seal the sheet. Douglas Gumbley, director of Posts to the Iraq Government in the 1930s, realised there was a need for a lightweight form for use in the developing air services in, and through, the Middle East because regular <b>overland</b> <b>mail</b> was charged <b>by</b> weight and varied in size and seemed likely to be too expensive for airmail service. He personally copyrighted the product in February 1933 and it was used first in Iraq and later in the British Mandate of Palestine where Gumbley was in charge of postal matters in the late 1930s.|$|R
50|$|In {{its early}} days, Wells Fargo {{participated in the}} staging {{business}} to support its banking and express businesses. But the character of Wells Fargo's participation changed when it helped start the <b>Overland</b> <b>Mail</b> Company. <b>Overland</b> <b>Mail</b> was organized in 1857 by men with substantial interests {{in four of the}} leading express companies—American Express, United States Express, Adams Express Company, and Wells Fargo. John Butterfield, the third founder of American Express, was made <b>Overland</b> <b>Mail's</b> president. In 1858 <b>Overland</b> <b>Mail</b> was awarded a government contract to carry United States Postal Service mail over the southern overland route from Memphis and St. Louis to California. From the beginning, Wells Fargo was <b>Overland</b> <b>Mail's</b> banker and primary lender.|$|R

50|$|In 1859, {{there was}} a crisis when Congress failed to pass the annual post office {{appropriation}} bill, thereby leaving the post office with no {{way to pay for}} the <b>Overland</b> <b>Mail</b> Company's services. As <b>Overland</b> <b>Mail's</b> indebtedness to Wells Fargo climbed, Wells Fargo became increasingly disenchanted with Butterfield's management strategy. In March 1860, Wells Fargo threatened foreclosure. As a compromise, Butterfield resigned as president of <b>Overland</b> <b>Mail,</b> and control of the company passed to Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo, however, did not acquire ownership of the company until the consolidation of 1866.|$|R
