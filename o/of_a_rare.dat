5|$|Allen {{was born}} with a {{deformed}} left arm from the effects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> object, known as Innocence. Abandoned by his parents, he was raised in a circus and meets clown Mana Walker (who adopts him when his contract with the circus expires). When Mana dies, Allen tries to resurrect him through Millennium Earl. Mana, revived as a demon known as an Akuma, cuts Allen's left eye. Allen's deformed left arm awakens as an anti-Akuma weapon, later called , and destroys Mana. His left eye allows him to see the souls of Akuma. Exorcist General Cross Marian soon adopts Allen as a disciple.|$|E

5|$|Beef steaks are {{commonly}} grilled, broiled or occasionally fried. Grilled beef steaks can be cooked at different temperatures, or for different lengths of time; the resulting cooked steak ranges from blue (very rare) to overdone. The most common characteristics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> steak is a soft, cold, red center. The outside is seared for flavor, while the inside is cooked {{to suit the}} diner's preference. Steaks cooked well-done are typically cooked throughout the entire cut of meat. For example, a beefsteak cooked well-done will not have any pinkness in the middle when sliced. Uncooked beef steak can be served raw, such as in steak tartare.|$|E

David is befriended by Teddy, a robotic teddy bear who cares for David's well-being.|$|E
5|$|England won the toss {{and the new}} captain {{received}} the first ball, but Gooch was soon out with the score on only 12. Some solid top-order play followed, with Curtis (30), Bailey (43) and Smith (57) all making starts but getting out when well set. From 120/3, England lost their remaining wickets for 85, but that is perhaps less surprising {{than the fact that}} off-spinner Roger Harper took three of them. A lion-hearted response by the England bowlers, led by Neil Foster (5/64), gave England a chance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> win, as the West Indies were dismissed for 183, giving the England team their first first-innings lead of the series, 22 runs ahead.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Sacred Spain: Art and Belief in the Spanish World brought {{together}} 71 {{works of art}} {{from a wide variety}} of lenders, including Peru, Mexico, and the Prado in Spain. The exhibit was composed <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> collection of pieces, many of which had never been on view in the United States. It featured paintings, sculpture, metalwork, and books by artists such as El Greco, Diego Velázquez, and Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. Andy Warhol Enterprises was displayed at the IMA from October, 2010 to January, 2011 and featured more than 150 works of art by Andy Warhol, as well as archival materials. The exhibition was the largest to illustrate Warhol's fascination with money and feature consumerism as a central theme. Visitors were able to view the progression of Warhol's career, from his beginnings as a commercial artist to his multimillion-dollar empire.|$|E
5|$|Playing the Yankees on June 25, 1953, he {{was part}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> {{defensive}} shift; leading 4–2 in the ninth inning, he was moved to first base, with Harry Dorish entering in relief. Pinch hitter Don Bollweg barely beat out a bunt single to first base, but Pierce than recorded a putout on Gil McDougald's grounder to third base. He then retook the mound, and after issuing a walk, gained the final two outs to finish the victory; the White Sox set an AL record by using five first basemen in the game. Pierce was also an excellent baserunner, and {{was used as a}} pinch runner 30 times between 1949 and 1957 – even scoring as a substitute for three-time stolen base champion Minnie Miñoso in a 5–4 victory over the Yankees on June 22, 1956.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} star is the magnitude2.2 Alpha Coronae Borealis. The yellow supergiant R Coronae Borealis is the prototype <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> class of giant stars—the R Coronae Borealis variables—that are extremely hydrogen deficient, and thought {{to result from}} the merger of two white dwarfs. T Coronae Borealis, {{also known as the}} Blaze Star, is another unusual type of variable star known as a recurrent nova. Normally of magnitude10, it last flared up to magnitude2 in 1946. ADS 9731 and Sigma Coronae Borealis are multiple star systems with six and five components respectively. Five star systems have been found to have Jupiter-sized exoplanets. Abell 2065 is a highly concentrated galaxy cluster one billion light-years from the Solar System containing more than 400 members, and is itself part of the larger Corona Borealis Supercluster.|$|E

5|$|The unique {{political}} structures of late Middle Ages Italy have led some to theorize that its unusual social climate allowed the emergence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> cultural efflorescence. Italy {{did not exist}} as a political entity in the early modern period. Instead, it was divided into smaller city states and territories: the Kingdom of Naples controlled the south, the Republic of Florence and the Papal States at the center, the Milanese and the Genoese {{to the north and}} west respectively, and the Venetians to the east. Fifteenth-century Italy {{was one of the most}} urbanised areas in Europe. Many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient Roman buildings; it seems likely that the classical nature of the Renaissance was linked to its origin in the Roman Empire's heartland.|$|E
5|$|Located {{close to}} Polaris is Lambda Ursae Minoris, a red giant of {{spectral}} type M1III. It is a semiregular variable varying from magnitudes 6.35 to 6.45. The northerly {{nature of the}} constellation means that the variable stars can be observed all year: the red giant R Ursae Minoris is a semiregular variable varying from magnitude 8.5 to 11.5 over 328days, while S Ursae Minoris is a long period variable that ranges between magnitudes 8.0 and 11 over 331days. Located south of Kochab and Pherkad towards Draco is RR Ursae Minoris, a red giant of spectral type M5III that is also a semiregular variable ranging from magnitude 4.44 to 4.85 {{over a period of}} 43.3days. T Ursae Minoris is another red giant variable star that has undergone a dramatic change in status—from being a long period (Mira) variable ranging from magnitude 7.8 to 15 over 310–315 days to a semiregular variable. The star is thought to have undergone a shell helium flash—a point where the shell of helium around the star's core reaches a critical mass and ignites—marked by its abrupt change in variability in 1979. Z Ursae Minoris is a faint variable star that suddenly dropped 6magnitudes in 1992 and was identified as one <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> class of stars—R Coronae Borealis variables.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark {{was first}} teased to {{consumers}} in April 2009 via a screenshot <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Rare</b> employee's Xbox 360 dashboard which showed an icon for the game. It was confirmed {{to be in}} development on June 2, 2009 via Xbox Live Director of Programming Larry Hryb's Twitter account. The game was released on March 17, 2010 as part of Microsoft's Xbox Live Block Party promotion. As a cross-promotion with the game Crackdown 2, users can unlock that game's protagonist, known simply as Agent 4, although a Crackdown 2 savegame is required on the Xbox 360 hard drive. A title update was released in April 2010 which addressed bugs, added two control schemes, and expanded playlists. Perfect Dark was downloaded over 150,000 times during its first week of release and grossed approximately $1.61 million {{at the end of}} the month. The game has sold more than 285,000 units as of August 2010 and nearly 325,000 units at the end of 2010. As of year-end 2011, sales had increased to nearly 410,000 units. In 2015, the game was included in the Rare Replay video game compilation for Xbox One.|$|E

5|$|Rupert's {{imprisonment}} {{became more}} relaxed {{on the advice}} of the Archduke Leopold, Ferdinand's younger brother, who met and grew to like Rupert. Rupert practised etching, played tennis, practised shooting, read military textbooks and was taken on accompanied hunting trips. He also entered into a romantic affair with Susan Kuffstein, the daughter of Count von Kuffstein, his gaoler. He received a present <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> white poodle that Rupert called Boy, or sometimes Pudel, and which remained with him into the English Civil War. Despite attempts by a Franco-Swedish army to seize Linz and free Rupert, his release was ultimately negotiated through Leopold and the Empress Maria Anna; in exchange for a commitment never again to take up arms against the Emperor, Rupert would be released. Rupert formally kissed the Emperor's hand at the end of 1641, turned down a final offer of an Imperial command and left Germany for England.|$|E
5|$|Through the Etherians, Voyager learns of {{an energy}} field being {{projected}} by a gigantic space station, the Forge, which is draining power and preventing repairs from being completed. To counteract {{the effects of}} the field, chief engineer B'Elanna Torres suggests the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> substance called Isodesium, and the Hazard Team is sent on a stealth mission to the scavenger base to steal their supplies of Isodesium. However, the mission is a disaster: despite acquiring the Isodesium, one crewman is briefly captured and another team member is critically injured. As the team attempts to extract, Borg drones transport into the extraction point, killing another team member, capturing Lieutenant Foster and taking the Isodesium. In Foster's absence, Munro is made the team leader. Along with Seven of Nine, the team transports to the Borg cube to retrieve the Isodesium. While on the cube, Munro is given the chance to rescue Foster from assimilation by the Borg. Matters are complicated when the Borg corner the team, leveraging their freedom and the Isodesium for assistance against a number of Species 8472 on board, a race highly resistant to the Borg. Although successful, the Borg attempt to assimilate the team; anticipating a double cross, however, Munro has Chang detonate an explosive in a sensitive part of the cube and the team escapes with the Isodesium in the chaos.|$|E
