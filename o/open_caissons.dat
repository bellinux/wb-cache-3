There are many {{engineering}} measures for toe protection, such as sheet piles, small <b>open</b> <b>caissons</b> and the indirect protection of groin group. Before these measures were used, people normally used rock riprap and other large-scale materials (in this paper the large-scale materials refer to riprap、concert or reinforced concrete block {{and other kinds of}} frame). But their effects are not good for resisting toe scour, although it is successful when this materials are used in the Yangtze and Yellow rivers in China. The characteristics of erosion-resisting of different materials (including block stone, reinforced concrete block and frame) were studied in physical tidal bore model experiment. It is shown from the experimental results that the large-scale materials can be successfully applied in the cutoff and blocking...|$|E

50|$|A caisson is sunk by self-weight, {{concrete}} {{or water}} ballast placed on top, or by hydraulic jacks. The leading edge (or cutting shoe) of the caisson is sloped {{out at a}} sharp angle to aid sinking in a vertical manner; it is usually made of steel. The shoe is generally wider than the caisson to reduce friction, and the leading edge may be supplied with pressurised bentonite slurry, which swells in water, stabilizing settlement by filling depressions and voids.

500|$|In early 1917, Tompkins {{submitted}} {{a plan to}} attempt a pumping out of the constructed cofferdam, which it noted as dangerous to the crew. This plan was denied {{because there was no}} artificial seal in place. The commission did not want Tompkins to proceed until the commission consulted an advisory engineer. In April 1917, William Burr was made the advisory engineer and made many changes to the original Strauss designs, most importantly the requirement that piers project into the concrete cylinders was stricken. Burr's alterations called for an <b>open</b> <b>caisson</b> for the central piers which made impossible the projection of piles into the concrete and required dredging that was unnecessary under the initial Strauss plan. The seal for the end piers was thickened to [...] and would be deposited through a tremie, as previously suggested by Tompkins. The Bridgeport bridge commission terminated the contract on August 20, 1917 and notified Tompkins that it would complete the project. The commission had Tompkin's crew forcibly ejected from the site on September 3, 1917 and took possession of its equipment until October 19, 1917. While the contract allowed the equipment to be taken, it also stipulated that delays that were the fault of the city would result in an equal extension to the time lost and Tompkins would sue the City of Bridgeport. The City of Bridgeport hired another contractor to complete the bridge.|$|R
40|$|The potash {{industry}} in Saskatchewan produces potash tailings as a waste material. These tailings are transported in a brine slurry to the tailings facility {{where they are}} spigotted onto the tailings pile. The current maximum height of the potash tailings piles in Saskatchewan ranges from 50 to 60 meters, in which only the bottom 3 to 5 meters of tailings is saturated. In the management of these waste piles, concerns regarding {{the environmental impact of}} the tailings pile on the existing groundwater, an tmderstand ing of a brine balance within the pile, and the stability of the pile arise. In order to address these concerns, an understanding of the flow of brine within the saturated-unsaturated potash tailings is critical. Analysis of the saturated-unsaturated flow syntem within the potash tailings requires that two basic relationships be established. These are the fluid retention and the permeability-suction curves. In order to examine the validity of the fluid retention curves evaluated in the laboratory and the calculated permeability-suction curves to the analysis of flow through the unsaturated potash tailings, a series of field infiltration tests were carried out on a tailings pile. These tests included single ring infiltrometer, shallow pit, <b>open</b> <b>caisson,</b> and trench type infiltration tests. The results of the single ring infiltrometer, shallow pit, and <b>open</b> <b>caisson</b> type infiltration tests Were used to establish the field saturated permeability of the tailings using analytical techniques. Monitoring of the trench infiltration test site for negative fluid pressure and fluid content within the tailings using tensiometers and neutron probes was used to establish the fluid retention curves for the tailings in the field. These field curves were then compared with laboratory evaluation of the fluid retention curve using the Tempe pressure cell method. The responses of the field instrumentation during the trench infiltration tests were also compared to the results of the computer simulation of infiltration which utilized the laboratory fluid retention curves and permeability functions as input data. In addition, sensitivity analyses of the various parameters characterizing the tailings material properties were performed also. In general, measurement of the field saturated permeability using the infiltration tests gives quite consistent results and indicates a significant degree of anisotropy in the permeability of the tailings. A good correlation is found between the fluid retention curve measured in the field using a gravimetric determination of the fluid content and the curves that were obtained in the laboratory. The field curves that were defined by using the neutron probe measurements indicate that fluid contents are too high in comparison to the laboratory curves. Numerical simulation of brine infiltration using laboratory data is in good agreement with field measurements both in terms of infiltration rate and pressure renponse. Sensitivity analyses illustrate that both the infiltration rate and the propagation of the wetting front are strongly dependent on the horizontal and vertical permeability, the degree of anisotropy and the fluid storage capacity of the tailings. In conclusion, the characterization of the potash tailings by a fluid retention curve determined in the laboratory and a calculated permeability-suction relationship is found to be adequate...|$|R

Construction of Arkansas' 2.5 mi approach of highway and bridge, costing $66 million, began in March 2006; Mississippi began its 1.8 mi approach in April, 2006, costing almost $86 million. Hill Brothers Construction and Jensen Construction, in a joint venture with the Rasmussen Group, were awarded the contract for the eastern approach of US 82 in Greenville to the Mississippi River crossing. Hills Brothers Construction was awarded a $85.9 million contract to work on the road deck of the Mississippi approach to the bridge, the concrete footings, and the substructure and superstructure of that portion. Austin Bridge and Road was awarded a $65 million contract to build Arkansas's 4657 ft of approach bridge and 3225 ft of connecting roadway which was completed in August 2009. The remaining contract, to apply a latex surface to the bridge, add stripes, tie US 82 into the approaches, and dismantle the Humphreys Bridge, was awarded in January 2010.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{observational}} method was introduced into geotechnical engineering to improve both theories and construction techniques. This method {{was developed to}} avoid highly conservative assumptions about soil properties in geotechnical design when faced with unavoidable uncertainties of natural ground conditions. The assumptions involved in soil mechanics theories usually differ {{to a certain extent}} from reality. These assumptions can be improved by employing an observational database. Thus, theories of geotechnical engineering can be developed by observations during the construction stage. Moreover, precise management of construction work by close observations is essential to avoid risk and to alter the design if needed to match the real conditions. This paper sheds some light on the importance of the observational concept in deep foundations through three case studies. The first one demonstrates the effect of working hypotheses on design outputs of an <b>open</b> <b>caisson</b> of 22 m internal diameter. The other two case studies present the difference between theory and reality during construction stage of auger cast-in-place piles (ACIP) in difficult subsoil conditions. Importance of merging the documented theories with the available observations is discussed. The study shows that working hypotheses and engineering models affect the cost and the time required for construction of deep foundations. Field observations are essential during installation of ACIP at a site. Some precautions should be considered when drilling ACIP through sandstone of inclined top surface. These precautions are mainly dependent upon field observations during construction. ACIP can be used effectively in soil formations that have galleries and caves using a cement–bentonite mixture to fill the holes of the unsuccessful piles. Finally, the paper shares a series of practical guidelines with engineering community all over the world that may assist in design and construction of deep foundations...|$|R
