5|$|DeHavilland's career spanned 53 years, from 1935 to 1988. During that time, she {{appeared}} in 49 feature films, {{and was one of}} the leading movie stars during the golden age of Classical Hollywood. She began her career playing demure ingénues opposite popular male stars, including Errol Flynn, with whom she made her breakout film Captain Blood in 1935. They would go on to make eight more feature films together, and became one of Hollywood's most popular romantic on-screen pairings. Her range of performances included roles in most major movie genres. Following her film debut in the Shakespeare adaptation A Midsummer Night's Dream, deHavilland achieved her initial popularity in romantic comedies, such as The Great Garrick and Hard to Get, and Western adventure films, such as Dodge City and Santa Fe Trail. In her later career, she was most successful in drama films, such as In This <b>Our</b> <b>Life</b> and Light in the Piazza, and psychological dramas playing non-glamorous characters in films such as The Dark Mirror, The Snake Pit, and Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte.|$|E
5|$|Several {{interconnected}} themes {{run through}} Szabó’s films, {{the most common}} being {{the relationship between the}} personal and the political or historical. On the personal level, his first three feature films deal with coming of age issues, but political/historical events form the backdrop of these issues and continually rupture the attempts of the characters to lead their private lives. In an interview in 2008, Szabó said, “My mother once told me, ‘We had a nice childhood and our youth was beautiful, but <b>our</b> <b>life</b> was destroyed by politics and history.’” The political/historical events most commonly depicted are the dominant traumatic events of mid-20th century Hungarian and Central European history—Nazism, the Second World War, and, in Hungary—or, more accurately, Budapest—the Arrow Cross dictatorship and the Holocaust, the Communist takeover, and the 1956 Revolution. Szabó himself has frequently referred to this theme as the search for security.|$|E

But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that <b>our</b> <b>life</b> is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

5000|$|Distributism {{has often}} been {{described}} in opposition to both socialism and capitalism, which distributists see as equally flawed and exploitive. Thomas Storck argues: [...] "both socialism and capitalism are products of the European Enlightenment and are thus modernizing and anti-traditional forces. Further, some distributists argue that socialism is the logical conclusion of capitalism as capitalism's concentrated powers eventually capture the state, resulting in a form of socialism. In contrast, distributism seeks to subordinate economic activity to human life as a whole, to <b>our</b> spiritual <b>life,</b> <b>our</b> intellectual <b>life,</b> <b>our</b> family life".|$|R

25|$|Yes, I suppose. The {{violence}} {{served a}} therapeutic purpose. It's unsettling {{to think that}} at any moment life can flare up into senseless violence. But it can and does, and {{people need to be}} ready for it. What you make for others is first of all what you make for yourself. If I’m persuaded that <b>our</b> <b>life</b> is predicated upon violence, that the entire structure of what we call civilization, the scaffolding that we’ve built up over the millennia, can collapse at any moment, then whatever I write is going to be affected by that assumption. The process of life presupposes violence, in the plant world the same as the animal world. But among the animals only man can conceptualize violence. Only man can enjoy the idea of destruction.|$|E

25|$|Cabell {{maintained}} {{a close and}} lifelong friendship with well-known Richmond writer Ellen Glasgow, whose house on West Main Street {{was only a few}} blocks from Cabell's family home on East Franklin Street. They corresponded extensively between 1923 and Glasgow's death in 1945 and over 200 of their letters survive. Cabell dedicated his 1927 novel Something About Eve to her, and she in turn dedicated her book They Stooped to Folly: A Comedy of Morals (1929) to Cabell. In her autobiography, Glasgow also gave considerable thanks to Cabell for his help in the editing of her Pulitzer Prize-winning book In This <b>Our</b> <b>Life</b> (1941). However, late in their lives, friction developed between the two writers as a result of Cabell's critical 1943 review of Glasgow's novel A Certain Measure.|$|E

25|$|The strong anthropic {{principle}} (SAP) as explained by John D. Barrow and Frank Tipler states {{that this is}} all the case because the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life emerge within it. Some critics of the SAP argue in favor of a weak {{anthropic principle}} (WAP) similar to the one defined by Brandon Carter, which states that the universe's ostensible fine tuning is the result of selection bias (specifically survivor bias): i.e., only in a universe capable of eventually supporting life will there be living beings capable of observing and reflecting upon fine tuning. Most often such arguments draw upon some notion of the multiverse for there to be a statistical population of universes to select from and from which selection bias (our observance of only this universe, compatible with <b>our</b> <b>life)</b> could occur.|$|E
