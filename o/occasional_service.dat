CIT de la Vallée du Richelieu offers a bus service linking Saint-Hyacinthe to Longueuil by way of Beloeil along route 116. Its Longueuil terminus connects directly to the Yellow Line of the Montreal Metro. An additional, more <b>occasional</b> <b>service</b> links Beloeil to downtown Montreal directly.|$|E

2500|$|In a later {{publication}} and response Goldstein agreed to differ {{on the use}} of the word [...] "serf" [...] to prevent a terminological discussion distracting from the examination of societal conditions. He argued that running away was an act of desperation severing familial, social and economic ties. He discussed the form of partial manumission known as [...] "human lease" [...] and argued that: it only temporarily freed from daily service but not <b>occasional</b> <b>service</b> at the lord's discretion; the payment of an annual fee decided by the lord was required; it was revocable at will by the lord. Thus he felt it was a very weak form of manumission.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the level currently in use, there was formerly a lower platform on the southbound side (one track underneath the downtown local track on the upper level, and one side platform underneath the island platform above). The lower level was built together with the upper level platforms in the late 1920s/early 1930s, but existed as an unfinished shell until it was completed and opened in August 1952 to serve rush hour [...] trains.For most of its existence, the lower level platform was only used for <b>occasional</b> <b>service</b> specials, including summer [...] "Rockaway Special" [...] trains to Beach 98th Street at the Rockaways' Playland beginning in 1958, the Aqueduct Racetrack special fare trains from 1959 to 1981, and rush hour E trains in the 1970s, beginning on March 23, 1970.|$|E

2500|$|There were gaps in {{the work}} of Dionysius; he seems, in particular, to have taken the papal decretals not from the {{archives}} of the Roman Church, but from previous compilations, hence certain omissions, which need not arouse any suspicion of the authenticity of documents nor quotes, as to certain catholic apologists. In spite of its defects this collection far surpassed all previous efforts of the kind, not alone by its good order, but also by the clear, intelligible text of its version, and by the importance of its documents. Very soon it superseded all earlier collections and was much used (celeberimo usu), especially in the Roman Church, says Cassiodorus. It became popular in Spain and Africa and even before Charlemagne had found its way into Gaul and Britain. It was the medium by which the African canons reached the East. Copyists used it to correct the text of the other collections, a fact not to be lost sight of at the risk of taking an interdependence of manuscripts for an interdependence of collections. Despite its authority of daily use and its <b>occasional</b> <b>service</b> in the papal chancery, it never had a truly official character; it even seems that the popes were wont to quote their own decretal letters not from Dionysius, but directly from the papal registers. - In time the [...] "Collectio Dionysiana", as it came to be known, was enlarged and some of these additions entered the [...] "Collectio Hadriana", which pope Adrian I sent (774) to Charlemagne, and which was received by the bishops of the empire at Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen) in 802. It is none other than the [...] "Collectio Dionysiana", with some additions in each of its two parts. In this shape it acquired and kept the title of [...] "Codex Canonum". Neither the action of Pope Adrian nor the acceptance by the Synod of Aix-la-Chapelle conferred on the book an official character, or made it a code of universally obligatory laws; with much greater reason may it be said that it did not thereby become an exclusively authoritative code of ecclesiastical law.|$|E
