Finally deciding that enough is enough, Hester reveals that she has decided to join a terrorist group and take over a television studio at gunpoint to announce their manifesto for reform to the whole city.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the spread}} of patriarchy is not even. The nature and degree of women’s {{subordination}} vary across classes, regions, and the rural/urban divide. Patriarchal structures are relatively stronger in the rural and tribal setting where local customs establish male authority and power over women's lives. On the other hand, women belonging to the upper and middle classes have increasingly greater access to education and employment opportunities and can assume greater control <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E
25|$|Established uitlanders, {{including}} the mining magnates, wanted political, social, and economic control <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> These rights included a stable constitution, a fair franchise law, an independent judiciary, {{and a better}} educational system. The Boers, for their part, recognised that the more concessions they made to the uitlanders the greater the likelihood – with approximately 30,000 white male Boer voters and potentially 60,000 white male uitlanders – that their independent control of the Transvaal would be lost and the territory absorbed into the British Empire.|$|E

25|$|Taíno {{society was}} based on a matrilineal system, meaning that descent was traced through the mother and that women lived {{together}} with other women and their children apart from the men. Because of this Taíno women seem to {{have had a lot of}} control <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> their co-villagers and their bodies. Since they lived separately from men, they were able to decide when they wanted to involve in sexual contact. This is in part what shaped the views of conquistadors who came in contact with Taíno culture. They reportedly perceived women as “macho women” who had strong control over the men.|$|E
25|$|Findings {{have shown}} in {{specific}} cases that paranormal belief {{acts as a}} psychodynamic coping function {{and serves as a}} mechanism for coping with stress. Survivors from childhood sexual abuse, violent and unsettled home environments have reported to have higher levels of paranormal belief. A study of a random sample of 502 adults revealed paranormal experiences were common in the population which were linked to a history of childhood trauma and dissociative symptoms. Research has also suggested that people who perceive themselves as having little control <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> may develop paranormal beliefs to help provide an enhanced sense of control.|$|E

25|$|The {{goal of a}} trafficker is to turn a {{human being}} into a slave. To do this, {{perpetrators}} employ tactics {{that can lead to}} the psychological consequence of learned helplessness for the victims, where they sense that they no longer have any autonomy or control <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> Traffickers may hold their victims captive, expose them to large amounts of alcohol or use drugs, keep them in isolation, or withhold food or sleep. During this time the victim often begins to feel the onset of depression, guilt and self-blame, anger and rage, and sleep disturbances, PTSD, numbing, and extreme stress. Under these pressures, the victim can fall into the hopeless mental state of learned helplessness.|$|E

Over the years, he taught {{at a number of}} other universities including the University of Cincinnati, Yale University, Harvard University, and the New School for Social Research. Numerous poets, critics and scholars, including Kathleen Spivack, James Atlas, Helen Vendler, and Dudley Young have written essays about Lowell's teaching style and/or about his influence <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> In 2012, Spivack also published a book, With Robert Lowell and His Circle, about her experience studying with Lowell at Boston University in 1959.

25|$|The {{ability to}} live {{independently}} with CP varies widely, depending {{partly on the}} severity of each person's impairment and partly on the capability of each person to self-manage the logistics of life. Some individuals with CP require personal assistant services for all activities of daily living. Others only need assistance with certain activities, and still others do not require any physical assistance. But regardless {{of the severity of}} a person's physical impairment, a person's ability to live independently often depends primarily on the person's capacity to manage the physical realities of his or her life autonomously. In some cases, people with CP recruit, hire, and manage a staff of personal care assistants (PCAs). PCAs facilitate the independence of their employers by assisting them with their daily personal needs in a way that allows them to maintain control <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E

500|$|In The Slave Community, Blassingame {{argues that}} [...] "historians have never {{systematically}} explored the life experiences of American slaves." [...] He asserts that {{by concentrating on}} the slaveowner, historians have presented a distorted view of plantation life that [...] "strips the slave of any meaningful and distinctive culture, family life, religion, or manhood." [...] Blassingame outlines that the reliance on planter sources led historians like Elkins to mimic planter stereotypes of slaves such as the [...] "submissive half-man, half child" [...] Sambo. Noting the agency slaves possessed <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> he contends, [...] "Rather than identifying with and submitting totally to his master, the slave held onto many remnants of his African culture, gained a sense of worth in the quarters, {{spent most of his}} time free from surveillance by whites, controlled important aspects of his life, and did some personally meaningful things on his own volition." ...|$|E
500|$|Berger's {{choice of}} [...] "framework for {{understanding}} Wicca {{within the context}} of late modernity" [...] was that of structuration, a theory put forward by the English sociologist and political theorist Anthony Giddens (1938) in his book The Constitution of Society (1984). Structuration theory maintains that both structure and agency influence human beings in their choices; the former refers to the recurrent patterned arrangements which influence or limit the choices and opportunities available for an individual, whilst the latter refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices. Berger argued that whilst the beliefs and practices of Wiccans were [...] "in part determined by social factors, such as class, race and gender", at the same time these Wiccans exerted a level of control and self-determination <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> [...] "both by the very act of becoming a Witch and through the self-conscious use of rituals to create a persona." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{long line}} of {{scholars}} has challenged conventional views of the African diaspora as a mere dispersion of Black people. For them, it is a movement of liberation that opposes the implications of racialization. Their position assumes that Africans and their descendants abroad struggle to reclaim power <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> through voluntary migration, cultural production and political conceptions and practices. It also implies the presence of cultures of resistance with similar objectives throughout the global diaspora. Thinkers like W. E. B. Dubois and more recently Robin Kelley, for example, have argued that Black politics of survival reveal more {{about the meaning of}} the African diaspora than labels of ethnicity and race, and degrees of skin hue. From this view, the daily struggle against what they call the [...] "world-historical processes" [...] of racial colonization, capitalism, and western domination defines Blacks links to Africa.|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with the}} New Left and the Civil Rights Movement, the hippie {{movement}} {{was one of}} three dissenting groups of the 1960s counterculture. Hippies rejected established institutions, criticized middle class values, opposed nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War, embraced aspects of Eastern philosophy, championed sexual liberation, were often vegetarian and eco-friendly, promoted the use of psychedelic drugs which they believed expanded one's consciousness, and created intentional communities or communes. They used alternative arts, street theatre, folk music, and psychedelic rock as a part of their lifestyle and as a way of expressing their feelings, their protests and their vision of the world and life. Hippies opposed political and social orthodoxy, choosing a gentle and nondoctrinaire ideology that favored peace, love and personal freedom, expressed for example in The Beatles' song [...] "All You Need is Love". Hippies perceived the dominant culture as a corrupt, monolithic entity that exercised undue power <b>over</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> calling this culture [...] "The Establishment", [...] "Big Brother", or [...] "The Man". Noting that they were [...] "seekers of meaning and value", scholars like Timothy Miller have described hippies as a new religious movement.|$|E
