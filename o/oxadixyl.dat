50|$|Seed {{treatment}} {{has been shown}} to be effective in controlling the disease, as the establishment of P. halstedii in an area of soil is nearly irreversible. The compounds metalaxyl and <b>oxadixyl</b> have been shown to protect seeds in the case of infection, and treatments containing these compounds are commercially available. Fungicides seed dressings of this nature have also been shown to give significant control over the pathogen. However, some strains of P. halstedii have begun to show resistance to metalaxyl-based fungicides, reported in multiple countries. Alternate forms of resistance are being developed for the future, including the use of biological antagonists and defense-related proteins.|$|E
40|$|Pesticides used in crop {{production}} {{are the most}} important source of diffuse pollution to groundwater, and their discharge into surface water may be a contributing factor towards the decline of living resources and the deterioration of ecosystems. In this work, we studied the movement of <b>oxadixyl</b> through soil columns (30 cm length and 14 cm diameter) in laboratory conditions using onion soil from Lake Tota (Boyacá, Colombia). A solution of 0. 01 M CaCl 2, containing a tracer (bromide) and <b>oxadixyl</b> was sprayed onto the surface of the soil column, and then simulated rainfall was applied at an intensity of 0. 034 cm h- 1. After 30 days, and 2. 13 relative pore volumes, <b>oxadixyl</b> percentages recovered {{at the bottom of the}} column were 92. 1 %. The <b>oxadixyl</b> experimental elution curve was analyzed using the Stanmod program (inverse problem) to obtain transport parameters. The non-equilibrium chemical model described the experimental elution curve well. The tail of the elution curve was particularly well captured. The retardation factor calculated for the fungicide was 3. 94 and the partition coefficient, kd, was close to 1 kg L- 1, indicating low adsorption in this soil. Under the experimental conditions, it could be concluded that <b>oxadixyl</b> is mobile in this soil, and therefore presents a risk of potential groundwater contamination...|$|E
40|$|Downy mildew of broccoli, {{caused by}} the fungus Peronospora parasitica, is a {{perennial}} disease problem affecting winter broccoli production in Arizona. During 1985 - 87, potential systemic fungicides were evaluated {{in the field for}} disease control. In the 1985 - 86 season, a period of high disease incidence, lesion development was significantly reduced by fosetyl-Al (44 %), phosphorous acid (42 %), <b>oxadixyl</b> + mancozeb (35 %), chlorothalonil (33 %), metalaxyl + mancozeb (30 %) and metalaxyl + chlorothalonil (28 %). During the 1986 - 87 growing season, disease incidence was low and lesion development was significantly reduced by phosphorous acid (82 %), fosetyl -Al or <b>oxadixyl</b> + chlorothalonil (77 %), metalaxyl + chlorothalonil (68 %) and chlorothalonil (54 %). Fosetyl-Al, phosphorous acid and <b>oxadixyl</b> were as effective as currently available fungicides (metalaxyl and chlorothalonil) for control of downy mildew of broccoli in Arizona...|$|E
40|$|The {{mycelium}} of Phomopsis helianthi (Ascomycete) was hydrolyzed with boiling NaOH {{to give an}} insoluble fraction {{composed of}} chitosan and glucans. The biomass obtained was tested as an agent {{for the removal of}} pesticides from an aqueous solution. <b>Oxadixyl,</b> which has a solubility in water of 3400 mg L− 1, has been chosen as a hydrophilic organic contaminant model. The new, cheap material was demonstrated to recover up to 6 mg of <b>oxadixyl</b> per gram of adsorbent. The experimental data show an excellent correlation with the Langmuir isotherm model...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the three}} {{fungicides}} tested in vitro against Sclerospora graminicola, metalaxyl and <b>oxadixyl</b> were effective in completely inhibiting sporangial production and germination at 250 ppm concentration. With mancozeb, complete inhibition of sporangial production was observed only at 1000 ppm concentration {{while there was}} no complete inhibition of sporangial germination even at 1000 ppm. In a field trial conducted during the kharif season of 1985, metalaxyl 25 WP seed treatment protected the pearl millet crop from downy mildew upto 30 days. Seed treatment followed by one foliar spray with metalaxyl or mancozeb was more effective than seed treatment alone. Seed treatment with metalaxyl followed by a single combined foliar spray of metalaxyl + mancozeb was superior to seed treatment with metalaxyl followed by a single foliar spray of either of these fungicides. ...|$|E
40|$|Screening of a {{large number}} of {{emerging}} pollutants is highly desirable for the control of water quality. In this respect, a novel, fully automated contaminant screening method based on an integrated sample preconcentration and liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (SPE-UHPLC-HRMS) has been developed. The optimal chromatographic column and experimental conditions allowing the retention and subsequent elution of the maximum number of analytes were defined. Liquid chromatography and Q-exactive (Orbitrap (TM)) parameters were optimized to obtain the best separation of molecules of interest, and the lowest detection limits. Due to the large amount of data to compare, a script written in R language was developed to evaluate the quality of the data generated by the comparison of 14 experimental conditions. The developed method enables the simultaneous semi quantitative analysis of 539 compounds (pesticides and drug residues), in 36 min with only 5 mL of water. Method validation was achieved through studies of repeatability, selectivity, linearity and matrix effect. Application to 20 tap water samples collected in and around Paris showed the presence of 34 different compounds all with concentrations below 0. 1 mu g/L, the European Union limit for drinking water. Pesticides and transformation products frequently found in water resources such as atrazine and its metabolites, hexazinone, <b>oxadixyl,</b> propazine and simazine were detected. Drug residues such as valsartan and carbamazepine, usually not monitored, were also found. The next step will be to assess the ability of this method to highlight the presence of unexpected contaminants not present in our database. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
