40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effect of levels of supplementation in morphometric carcass traits and the non-carcass-components of crossbred Anglo Nubian x non-defined breed (NDB) goats under grazing system of semi-arid native pasture, during the dry season. The study was conducted from August to December, at the Agronomic Institute of Pernambuco, located in the municipality of Sertânia-PE, in the Moxotó microregion 600 m above sea level. Twenty-eight castrated goats Anglo Nubian x NDB, six month-old and averaging 18. 75 ± 2 kg of initial live weight (LW) were used. The management system was semi-intensive with animals grazing in native pasture (caatinga) {{during the day and}} being transferred to individual pens {{at the end of the}} day, receiving concentrate (0. 0; 0. 5; 1. 0 and 1. 5 % of LW). The productive performance was impacted as increased supplemented feeding, with higher live weight and hot and cold carcass weights at the supplementation level of 1. 5 % LW. It also occurred to the morphometric measurements made on the back (width and girth). The weight of lung, heart, liver, spleen and pancreas were influenced by the supplementation. Small intestine also showed significant difference (P< 0. 05) in weight, which increased in a linear way as the supplementation levels increased; related to the co-products, <b>only</b> <b>fats</b> (mesentery, omentum and total fat) increased weight due to increased energy reserves. The increased level of supplementation resulted in a high linear effect for carcass weight and the same effect for some organs and viscera that were marketed in the Northeast region, contributing to increase the income of goat production in the caatinga. The supplementation level of 1. 5 % LW is the most suitable for animals bred under such conditions...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of an infant formula supplemented with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) on iron metabolism in rats. Three isocaloric diets were given to weaning rats during 28 days (150 g/kg fat) : control diet (C), unsupplemented (F) and supplemented (FS) infant formula (as the <b>only</b> <b>fat</b> source) diets. Food intake and body weight evolution showed no significant differences between F and FS, but in both groups resulted lower compared to C. LCPUFA supplementation did not affect apparent iron absorption and retention nor the absorption and retention efficiencies, haemoglobin, serum iron, total iron binding capacity, haematocrit, liver and spleen iron. However, erythrocytic iron showed significant differences: FS>F>C. The results indicate that consumption of a diet containing an infant formula supplemented with LCPUFA does not affect iron metabolism in growing rats. Further studies based on the relationship between iron and lipid composition of erythrocytic membranes are required. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
