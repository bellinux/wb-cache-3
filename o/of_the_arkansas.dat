5|$|In 1942, the Tower Building was renovated due to {{the efforts}} of the Æsthetic Club, Little Rock philanthropist Frederick W. Allsop, and the Works Progress Administration.

5|$|On both {{approach}}es, the dropoff is steep {{enough for}} Highway 82 {{to require a}} 6% grade and switchbacks: one on the west and three on the east. The former approach uses the narrow valley of the Roaring Fork River, {{a tributary of the}} Colorado, which rises from Independence Lake west of the pass.

25|$|By <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Murfreesboro, <b>the</b> 4th <b>Arkansas</b> {{had been}} issued McCown Style battle flag. This was a {{moderately}} rectangular banner with a predominantly blue field. The field was crossed {{with a white}} St. Andrew's Cross and the entire flag was bordered in white. From battle descriptions {{it is likely that}} every regiment of McNair's Arkansas Brigade carried a similar flag. Only one of these flags survived <b>the</b> war, that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 25th <b>Arkansas</b> Infantry Regiment, which was then known as <b>the</b> 30th <b>Arkansas.</b> <b>The</b> flag <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 25th/30th <b>Arkansas</b> was captured after the color bearer's hand was shot off.

5|$|The Colorado River basin shares {{drainage}} boundaries {{with many}} other major watersheds of North America. The Continental Divide of the Americas forms {{a large portion of}} the eastern boundary of the watershed, separating it from the basins of the Yellowstone River and the Platte River – both tributaries of the Missouri River – on the northeast, and from the headwaters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arkansas</b> River on the east. Both the Missouri and Arkansas rivers are part of the Mississippi River system. Further south, the Colorado River basin borders on the Rio Grande drainage, which along with the Mississippi flows to the Gulf of Mexico, as well as a series of endorheic (closed) drainage basins in southwestern New Mexico and extreme southeastern Arizona.|$|E

After its rotation, the brigade trained the 39th Infantry Brigade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arkansas</b> Army National Guard, which saw the next rotation in the JRTC.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Clinton made reform <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arkansas</b> {{education}} system {{a top priority}} of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was also an attorney {{as well as the}} chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session—the longest in Arkansas history. Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship. He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).|$|E
5|$|The Brigade was alerted for {{deployment}} to Iraq {{in support}} of Operation Iraqi Freedom in late 2005. In the summer of 2006, it trained for three months at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin to prepare. Its mission in Iraq was to integrate other smaller engineer units and provide engineer support to the other Army units operating in the country. The brigade headquarters took command of several other engineer battalions during this deployment. Among the units under brigade's control was the 502nd Engineer Battalion based in Hanau, Germany which worked on bridges around Baghdad, {{as well as the}} 875th Engineer Battalion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arkansas</b> Army National Guard based at Camp Striker and the active duty 92nd Engineer Battalion.

5|$|Tulsa was a {{small town}} near the banks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arkansas</b> River in 1901 when its first oil well, named Sue Bland No. 1, was established. Much of the oil was {{discovered}} on land whose mineral rights were owned {{by members of the}} Osage Nation under a system of headrights. By 1905, the discovery of the large Glenn Pool (located approximately 15 miles south of downtown Tulsa and site of the present-day town of Glenpool) prompted a rush of entrepreneurs to the area's growing number of oil fields; Tulsa's population swelled to over 140,000 between 1901 and 1930. By 1909, seven years after the discovery of oil in the area, Tulsa's population had sprouted to 180,000. Unlike the early settlers of Northeastern Oklahoma, who most frequently migrated from the South and Texas, many of these new oil-driven settlers came to Tulsa from the commercial centers of the East Coast and lower Midwest. This migration distinguished the city's demographics from neighboring communities (Tulsa has larger and more prominent Catholic and Jewish populations than most Oklahoma cities) and is reflected in the designs of early Tulsa's upscale neighborhoods.|$|E
