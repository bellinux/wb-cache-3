5|$|During {{the first}} weekend of sale, {{more than one million}} units were sold. Soon after {{the first weekend}}, Ashok Kumar, a {{technology}} analyst for a financial firm predicted that Apple would sell 35 million iPad 2s in 2011. Investment banking firm, Piper Jaffray monitored the initial sales of the iPad 2 and reported that 70% of all iPad 2 sales were to first-time iPad buyers with 49% <b>of</b> <b>buyers</b> owning a PC compared to the initial buyers of the original iPad where only 26% <b>of</b> <b>buyers</b> owned a PC. 12,000 units were sold on auction site eBay in its first two weeks of release. When the iPhone 4S was released, rumors about the third generation iPad caused a decline in iPad 2 sales. Official figures released {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2011 indicate that Apple sold 11.4 million iPads in the third quarter, a 166% increase from the third quarter of 2010.|$|E
5|$|Most of Paine's {{arguments}} {{had long}} been available to the educated elite, but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style, he made deism appealing and accessible to a mass audience. Originally distributed as unbound pamphlets, the book was also inexpensive, putting it within the reach {{of a large number}} <b>of</b> <b>buyers.</b> Fearing the spread of what they viewed as potentially revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted printers and book-sellers who tried to publish and distribute it. Nevertheless, Paine's work inspired and guided many free thinkers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} summer of 1920, a total of 50,028 Maine Centennial half dollars were {{produced}} at the Philadelphia Mint, including 28 pieces reserved for inspection and testing at the 1921 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. No special care was taken in the minting; they were ejected into bins and many display bag marks. They were sent to Maine and placed on sale through the Office of the State Treasurer at a price of $1. Thirty thousand sold immediately and they remained on sale through the treasurer's office until all fifty thousand were vended, though this did not happen until at least 1929. Bowers speculated that had the full 100,000 authorized coins been struck, most of the additional quantity would have been returned to the Mint and melted for lack <b>of</b> <b>buyers.</b> Many pieces were spent {{in the years after}} 1920 and entered circulation.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates how the {{formation}} <b>of</b> larger <b>buyers</b> affects a supplier's profits and, by doing so, his incentives to undertake non-contractible activities. We first identify two chan-nels <b>of</b> <b>buyer</b> power, which allows larger buyers to obtain discounts. We subsequently exam-ine the effects <b>of</b> <b>buyer</b> {{power on the}} supplier's incentives and on social welfare. Contrary to some informal claims in the policy debate on buyer power, {{we find that the}} exercise <b>of</b> <b>buyer</b> power-even though reducing supplier's profits- may often increase a supplier's incentive to undertake welfare enhancing activities...|$|R

25|$|For the Austrians, {{cost was}} a result of demand, as this would {{determine}} the level of production, depending on the willingness <b>of</b> <b>buyers</b> to pay that cost. Since demand is dependent upon the action <b>of</b> <b>buyers,</b> utility would determine a thing's cost rather than technology. In this context, the Austrian concept of opportunity cost claimed to ruin the British parametric concept of cost. The opportunity cost would be that which the purchaser would willingly forgo in agreeing to pay the cost of the option chosen.|$|E

40|$|Economic intuition {{suggests}} that increased competition generates lower prices. However, recent theoretical work {{shows that a}} monopolist may charge a lower price than a firm facing a competitor selling a differentiated product. The direction of the price change when competition is introduced is dependent upon the joint distribution <b>of</b> <b>buyer</b> values for the two products. We explore this relationship using controlled laboratory experiments. Our {{results indicate that the}} distribution <b>of</b> <b>buyer</b> values does affect prices {{in a manner consistent with}} the theoretical predictions, although price increasing competition is rare due in part to overly intense competition regardless of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>buyer</b> values.

25|$|Growth in the {{secondary}} market continued trending upward in 2014 reaching its highest level yet, with an estimated total transaction volume of $49.3bn per the Setter Capital Volume Report 2014, as follows: private equity $37.9 billion, real estate secondaries $6.8 billion, hedge fund side pockets $2.5 billion, infrastructure funding $1.9 billion and timber fund deals at $0.2 billion. According to Setter Capital Inc, there were a total of 1270 transactions in 2014, with an average size of approximately $37.7 million. Although the number of transactions was roughly {{the same as in}} 2013, the average deal size increased 34.6% year over year, reflecting the fact that more multi-hundred million / billion+ dollar transactions were completed in 2014. Indeed, the breadth and number <b>of</b> <b>buyers</b> continues to increase with total volume and activity of small and medium buyers becoming more significant. Large buyers accounted for 59.8% of the market’s total volume in 2014, while mid-sized buyers accounted for roughly 34.9% of total volume and small buyers represented roughly 5.3%. Also driving the expansion of {{the secondary}} market is the number <b>of</b> <b>buyers</b> expanding their scope of interest into areas in which they were previously inactive. Approximately 31.4% <b>of</b> <b>buyers</b> broadened their secondary focus in 2014 to include buying other alternative investment types (e.g. infrastructure, real estate, portfolios of direct, etc.) – an increase of 1.4% from 2013.|$|E

25|$|For example, in marketplaces such as eBay or Taobao, {{buyers and}} sellers are the two groups. Buyers prefer {{a large number of}} sellers, and, meanwhile, sellers prefer a large number <b>of</b> <b>buyers,</b> such that the members in one group can easily find their trading {{partners}} from the other group. Therefore, the cross-side network effect is positive. On the other hand, a large number of sellers mean severe competition among sellers. Therefore, the same-side network effect is negative. Figure 1 depicts these relationships.|$|E

25|$|By 1925, {{the market}} ran out <b>of</b> <b>buyers</b> {{to pay the}} high prices, and soon the boom became a bust. The 1926 Miami Hurricane, which nearly {{destroyed}} the city further depressed the real estate market. In 1928 another hurricane struck Southern Florida. The 1928 Okeechobee hurricane made landfall near Palm Beach, severely damaging the local infrastructure. In townships near Lake Okeechobee, the storm breached a dike separating the water from land, creating a storm surge that killed over 2,000 people and destroying the towns of Belle Glade and Pahokee.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies a model <b>of</b> <b>buyer</b> {{investment}} {{and its effect}} on the variety and vertical structure of international trade. A distinction is made between two types <b>of</b> <b>buyer</b> investment: "Flexible" and "specific", which differ in the ability <b>of</b> a <b>buyer</b> to match with a seller. The interaction <b>of</b> <b>buyer</b> investment with the entry and pricing incentives of suppliers are analyzed. It is shown that (i) there can be multiple equilibria in the variety of products traded, and (ii) less product variety is associated with more intrafirm trade. The possibility of multiple equilibria is consistent with the observation that some similar economies, such as Taiwan and South Korea, differ substantially in their export varieties to the U. S. A cross-country empirical analysis confirms the negative correlation between export variety and intrafirm trade.

In five forces analysis he identified the forces that shape the industry structure or environment.

Certain color base-model Neons, including red and black, had bumper covers molded in color rather than painted. These covers, while textured and not as glossy as paint, absorbed scuffs and scrapes with less visible damage. The mid-level Highline models in 95 & 96 used wheel covers with a bubble design. Initially, Neons were available in many bold colors including Nitro yellow-green, Lapis Blue, Aqua, and Magenta, however paint color choices became more subdued by the 1998-1999 model years, as the majority <b>of</b> <b>buyers</b> opted for more traditional colors.|$|E
