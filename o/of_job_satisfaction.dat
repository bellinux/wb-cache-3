Background: No model <b>of</b> nurse <b>job</b> <b>satisfaction</b> {{was found in}} the literature that had been empirically tested in Jamaica or surrounding countries in the Caribbean. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} test an instrument <b>of</b> nurse <b>job</b> <b>satisfaction</b> in Jamaica and use results to improve nurse <b>job</b> <b>satisfaction</b> at the unit level and refine efficiency of care delivery across the hospital. Methods: Convenience sampling was used to gather data in a 579 -bed urban hospital in Southeast Jamaica regarding nurse <b>job</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> nurses' clarity <b>of</b> self, role and system, and demographics. Parceling of data was used in a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test an 11 -factor construct <b>of</b> nurse <b>job</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> Hierarchical regression was used to examine explained variance <b>of</b> nurse <b>job</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> Results: Complete surveys from 82 nurses (14 % response rate) revealed good model fit for all 11 dimensions, including four social factors (satisfaction with relationship with coworkers, relationship with the patient, relationship with unit/ward manager, and relationship with physicians) and seven technical dimensions (satisfaction with resources, autonomy, staffing/scheduling, professional growth, executive leadership, distributive justice, and workload). Results revealed adequate fit, RMSEA. 08, CFI. 90, and SRMR. 07. Path coefficients ranged from. 35 to. 72 (p = <. 001 for all coefficients). The best fitting model for predicting nurse <b>job</b> <b>satisfaction</b> included service line (R =. 475, R 2 =. 226, F (7, 74) = 3. 078, p =. 007), and clarity of role (R =. 543, R 2 =. 295, F (1, 73) = 7. 192, p =. 009). Combined, both predictors explained 29. 5 % of the variance <b>of</b> nurse <b>job</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> Discussion: Data was presented to staff and management to understand the 11 dimensions <b>of</b> nurse <b>job</b> <b>satisfaction</b> in this sample in Jamaica. Results were presented at the aggregate hospital and unit level. Staff and management are currently using the results to make changes at the unit level, using the data to guide planning.

2500|$|Core self-evaluations (CSE) {{represent}} a stable personality trait which encompasses an individual's subconscious, fundamental evaluations about themselves, their own abilities {{and their own}} control.

[...] Conversely, people with low core self-evaluations will have a negative appraisal of themselves and will lack confidence.
