5|$|To {{support its}} {{assertion}} that the Sultan of Johor did not have sovereignty over Pedra Branca, Singapore contended that the traditional Malay concept of sovereignty was based mainly on control over people and not over territory. Thus, the only reliable way {{to determine whether a}} particular territory belonged to a ruler was to find <b>out</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants pledged allegiance to that ruler. This was difficult to do with respect to Pedra Branca since it was isolated and uninhabited, and Malaysia had not provided clear evidence of a direct claim to or actual exercise of sovereign authority over the island.|$|E
5|$|Some of a patient's single {{nucleotide}} polymorphismsslight {{differences in their}} DNAcan help predict how quickly they will metabolise particular drugs; this is called pharmacogenomics. For example, the enzyme CYP2C19 metabolises several drugs, such as the anti-clotting agent Clopidogrel, into their active forms. Some patients possess polymorphisms in specific places on the 2C19 gene that make poor metabolisers of those drugs; physicians can test for these polymorphisms and find <b>out</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> drugs will be fully effective for that patient. Advances in molecular biology have helped show that some syndromes that were previously classed as a single disease are actually multiple subtypes with entirely different causes and treatments. Molecular diagnostics can help diagnose the subtypefor example of infections and cancersor the genetic analysis of a disease with an inherited component, such as Silver-Russell syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The Malagasy on the ship, {{seeing the}} signal fires, cut the anchor cable, {{allowing}} Meermin to drift shorewards, where she grounded on a sandbank. Crew member Rijk Meyer, who had earlier been thrown overboard and swum around {{the ship to}} the safety of the gunroom, now swam from the ship to the shore and was brought to Le Sueur. He informed Le Sueur that the Malagasy on the ship had told him to find <b>out</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> earlier landing party was there, but that he had secretly arranged with the other crew members that, if help was available on shore, he would signal back to the ship by waving a handkerchief above his head. Six Malagasy and another crew member also left Meermin in a canoe, but a unit of the militia immediately surrounded the party when they landed. One Malagasy was shot dead and three others taken prisoner; the dead Malagasy was later identified by one of the ship's crew as the mutiny's overall ringleader, but his name was not recorded. Of the remaining two, one swam away and the other was believed either to have swum back to the ship or drowned in the attempt. Enraged by the crew's deception, the Malagasy still on Meermin launched an attack on the crew which lasted for three hours, but the crew were able to defend themselves.|$|E

25|$|Following Tibet's {{unexpected}} offer, the Mount Everest Committee {{decided on}} an {{attempt on the}} summit for 1936 but preceded by a reconnaissance in the current year. Tom Longstaff had been very praising of the Nanda Devi trek and so this approach {{would be used for}} 1935 on Everest. The reconnaissance could be mounted quickly and paid for out of the existing funds of £1,400 so that all the new funds raised could be allocated to the 1936 bid for the summit. Shipton was offered the leadership of the 1935 slot with Ruttledge's approval.

500|$|With digital effects work {{running behind}} schedule, Zemeckis {{convinced}} Wes Takahashi, an animation supervisor from visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic, to help work on The Frighteners. [...] "The shots Zemeckis showed me were pretty remarkable," [...] Takahashi reflected, [...] "but {{there were still}} about 400 shots to do, and everyone was kind of worried." [...] Takahashi was quickly drafted as a visual effects supervisor, and began looking at the schedule, trying to work <b>out</b> <b>whether</b> <b>The</b> Frighteners could be finished in time. [...] "There was no way we'd make the deadline. I figured out a concerted plan involving Jackson and Zemeckis to convince Universal it was worthy of asking for more money." [...] The executives at Universal proposed splitting some of the shots to visual effects companies in the United States, but Jackson, for whom the film {{was a chance to}} show New Zealand filmmaking could stand alongside Hollywood, convinced Universal otherwise. Instead, The Frighteners received an accelerated release date, four months earlier than planned, and an additional $6 million in financing, with fifteen digital animators and computer workstations (some were borrowed from Universal and other effects companies in the US). Andrew Adamson was hired as a digital effects supervisor.|$|E

2500|$|A British Court of Inquiry convened on 7 July 1943 to {{investigate}} the crash, following the order by Air Marshal Sir John Slessor of 5 July 1943.

The report noted that [...] "it has not been possible to determine how the jamming occurred" [...] although it ruled out sabotage. Slessor was not satisfied with the report and on 28 July ordered the Court to continue its investigation to find <b>out</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> controls were indeed jammed or not, and if they were, then for what reason.

[...] The comment came after the Indian team registered a one-point win over England to claim the gold medal.
