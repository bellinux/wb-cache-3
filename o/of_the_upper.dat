The Army of the Lower Rhine had a 20,000-strong right wing under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg on the east bank observing the French bridgehead at Düsseldorf. The archduke's remaining 70,000 troops lay on the west bank along the Nahe River with powerful garrisons in Mainz and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress.|$|E

5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} is congenital and {{is characterized by}} a number of nasal, facial and cranial features. These include a broad and high, sometimes depressed nasal bridge (top of the nose, between the eyes) and a flattened nasal tip. This can give the nose a shortened, arch-like appearance. Hypertelorism (unusually wide-set eyes), prominent frontal bones and supraorbital ridge (the eyebrow ridge), bilateral epicanthic folds (an extra flap of skin over the eyelids), a broad forehead and an overall enlarged head circumference have also been observed. A bulging <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> lip with an exaggerated cupid's bow shape, and maxillary hypoplasia (underdevelopment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> jaw) with retraction have also been reported.|$|E
5|$|On 29 September 1940, a mid-air {{collision}} occurred over Brocklesby, New South Wales, Australia. The accident was unusual {{in that the}} aircraft involved, two Avro Ansons of No.2 Service Flying Training School RAAF, remained locked together after colliding, and then landed safely. The collision stopped the engines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> Anson, but those of the machine underneath continued to run, allowing the pair of aircraft to keep flying. Both navigators and the pilot of the lower Anson bailed out. The pilot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> Anson {{found that he was}} able to control the interlocked aircraft with his ailerons and flaps, and made an emergency landing in a nearby paddock. All four crewmen survived the incident, and the upper Anson was repaired and returned to flight service.|$|E
