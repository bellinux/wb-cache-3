The first paper begins by defining set, subset, etc., {{in ways that}} would be largely acceptable now. The cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are reviewed. Cantor wanted the second paper to include a proof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> hypothesis, but had to settle for expositing his theory of well-ordered sets and ordinal numbers. Cantor attempts to prove that if A and B are sets with A equivalent to a subset of B and B equivalent to a subset of A, then A and B are equivalent. Ernst Schröder had stated this theorem a bit earlier, but his proof, as well as Cantor's, was flawed. Felix Bernstein supplied a correct proof in his 1898 PhD thesis; hence the name Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem.|$|E

40|$|We derive <b>the</b> elastodynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spacetime <b>continuum</b> by {{applying}} continuum me- chanical results to strained spacetime. Based on this model, a stress-strain relation is derived for <b>the</b> spacetime <b>continuum.</b> From <b>the</b> kinematic {{relations and the}} equilibrium dynamic equation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spacetime <b>continuum,</b> we derive a series <b>of</b> wave equations: <b>the</b> displacement, dilatational, rotational and strain wave equations. Hence energy propa- gates in <b>the</b> spacetime <b>continuum</b> as wave-like deformations which can be decomposed into dilatations and distortions. Dilatations involve an invariant change in volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spacetime <b>continuum</b> which is <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> associated rest-mass energy density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deformation, while distortions correspond to a change <b>of</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> space- time <b>continuum</b> without a change in volume and are thus massless. The deformations propagate in <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> by longitudinal and transverse wave displacements. This is somewhat reminiscent of wave-particle duality, with the transverse mode correspond- ing to the wave aspects and the longitudinal mode corresponding to the particle aspects. A continuity equation for deformations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spacetime <b>continuum</b> is derived, where <b>the</b> gradient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> massive volume dilatation acts as a source term. <b>The</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spacetime <b>continuum</b> volume force and the inhomogeneous wave equations need further investigation...|$|R

40|$|We study coupled axial and polar {{axisymmetric}} oscillations of {{a neutron}} star endowed with a strong magnetic field, having both poloidal and toroidal components. <b>The</b> toroidal component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetic field is driving the coupling between the polar and axial oscillations. The star is composed of a fluid core {{as well as a}} solid crust. Using a two dimensional general relativistic simulation and a magnetic field B = 10 ^ 16 G, we study the change in the polar and axial spectrum caused by the coupling. We find that the axial spectrum suffers a dramatic change in its nature, losing its continuum character. In fact, we find that only <b>the</b> 'edges' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continua</b> survive, generating a discrete spectrum. As a consequence the crustal frequencies, that in our previous simulation could be absorbed by <b>the</b> <b>continua,</b> if they were embedded inside it, are now long living oscillations.

25|$|If proof {{theory and}} model theory {{have been the}} {{foundation}} of mathematical logic, they have been {{but two of the}} four pillars of the subject. Set theory originated {{in the study of the}} infinite by Georg Cantor, and it has been the source of many of the most challenging and important issues in mathematical logic, from Cantor's theorem, through the status of the Axiom of Choice and the question of the independence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> hypothesis, to the modern debate on large cardinal axioms.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that I can find in Being and Event that the author really understands what he is talking about when he invokes (as he constantly does) Georg Cantor's theory of transfinite cardinals, the axioms of set theory, Gödel's incompleteness proof or Paul Cohen's proof of the independence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> hypothesis. When these things appear in Badiou's texts it is always allusively, with fragments of symbolism detached from the context that endows them with sense, and often with free variables and bound variables colliding randomly. No proof is clearly stated or examined, and the jargon of set theory is waved like a magician's wand, to give authority to bursts of all but unintelligible metaphysics.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} the {{symbiosis}} between fungus and plant reaches a point of inseparability; fungal material is transmitted vertically from the maternal parent plant to seeds, forming a near-obligate mutualism. Because seeds are {{an important aspect of}} both fecundity and competitive ability for plants, high germination rates and seedling survival increase lifetime fitness. When fitness of plant and fungus become tightly intertwined, it {{is in the best interest}} of the endophyte to act in a manner beneficial to the plant, pushing it further toward the mutualism end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuum.</b> Such effects of seed defense can also occur in dense stands of conspecifics through horizontal transmission of beneficial fungi. Mechanisms of microbial association defense, protecting the seeds rather than the already established plants, can have such drastic impacts on seed survival that they have been recognized to be an important aspect of the larger ‘seed defence theory’.|$|E

25|$|Jan van Mill has {{described}} βN as a 'three headed monster' — the three heads being a smiling and friendly head (the behaviour {{under the assumption}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> hypothesis), the ugly head of independence which constantly tries to confuse you (determining what behaviour is possible in different models of set theory), and the third head is the smallest of all (what you can prove about it in ZFC). It has relatively recently been observed that this characterisation isn't quite right - there {{is in fact a}} fourth head of βN, in which forcing axioms and Ramsey type axioms give properties of βN almost diametrically opposed to those under the continuum hypothesis, giving very few maps from N* indeed. Examples of these axioms include the combination of Martin's axiom and the Open colouring axiom which, for example, prove that (N*)2 ≠ N*, while the continuum hypothesis implies the opposite.|$|E
25|$|The {{validity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> {{assumption is}} dependent on the density of the gas and the application in question. For the continuum assumption to be valid, the mean free path length must be much smaller than the length scale of the application in question. For example, many aerodynamics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions, where the mean free path length is on the order of micrometers and where the body is orders of magnitude larger. In these cases, the length scale of the aircraft ranges from a few meters to a few tens of meters, which is much larger than the mean free path length. For such applications, the continuum assumption is reasonable. The continuum assumption is less valid for extremely low-density flows, such as those encountered by vehicles at very high altitudes (e.g. 300,000ft/90km) or satellites in Low Earth orbit. In those cases, statistical mechanics is a more accurate method of solving the problem than is continuum aerodynamics. The Knudsen number can be used to guide the choice between statistical mechanics and the continuous formulation of aerodynamics.|$|E
25|$|Psycho-physiological {{measures}} {{also serve}} as process indices of operator SA by providing {{an assessment of the}} relationship between human performance and a corrected change in the operator's physiology (e.g., French, Clark, Pomeroy, Seymour, & Clarke, 2007). In other words, cognitive activity is associated with changes in the operator's physiological states. For example, the operator's overall functional state (as assessed using psycho-physiological measures, such as electroencephalographic (EEG) data, eyeblinks, and cardiac activity) may provide an indication as to whether the operator is sleep fatigued at one end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuum,</b> or mentally overloaded at the other end (Wilson, 2000). Other psycho-physiological measures, such as event related potentials (ERP), event related desynchronization (ERD), transient heart rate (HR), and electrodermal activity (EDA), may be useful for evaluating an operator's perception of critical environmental cues, that is, to determine if the operator has detected and perceived a task-relevant stimulus (Wilson, 2000). In addition, it is also possible to use psycho-physiological measures to monitor operators' environmental expectancies, that is, their physiological responses to upcoming events, as a measure of their current level of SA (Wilson, 2000).|$|E
