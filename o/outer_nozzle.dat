40|$|A nozzle {{assembly}} is described {{for use in}} a system that forms small gas-filled shells, which avoids the need for holding a miniature inner nozzle precisely concentric with a miniature <b>outer</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The <b>outer</b> <b>nozzle</b> has a diameter which is less than about 0. 7 millimeter, which results in fluid passing through the nozzle having a progressively greater velocity at locations progressively further from the walls of the <b>outer</b> <b>nozzle</b> across most of the nozzle. This highly variable velocity profile automatically forces gas {{to the center of the}} <b>outer</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The end of the inner nozzle, which emits gas, is spaced upstream from the tip of the <b>outer</b> <b>nozzle,</b> to provide a distance along which to center the gas. This self-centering characteristic permits the inner nozzle to be positioned so its axis is not concentric with the axis of the <b>outer</b> <b>nozzle...</b>|$|E

His British patent, No. 1636 of 1864, contains points of interest. He realized that the high velocity of the gas jet exiting his combustion chamber nozzle offered a practical difficulty, and proposed to remedy this by the use of successive induced jets of increasing volume and consequently lower velocity. This was shown in his drawing, with gases being delivered through collinear nozzles of increasing diameter, with the <b>outer</b> <b>nozzles</b> operating at increased gas volumes with reduced velocities, similar to the exhaust of a high-bypass turbofan jet engine.|$|R
40|$|Three {{different}} {{structures of}} a new dual fuel nozzle design concept (inner swirl nozzle, double swirl <b>nozzle,</b> and <b>outer</b> swirl <b>nozzle)</b> were developed for the chemically recuperated gas turbine (CRGT) combustor. The combustion flow fields in the combustor with the three nozzles were investigated, respectively, based on the FLUENT simulation. The realizable - model and PDF model were adopted, respectively, for the turbulence flow and nonpremixed reformed gas combustion. The obtained results using these models showed good agreement with experimental results in original oil combustor. The effects of different dual fuel nozzle structures on the flow field, fuel concentration distribution, and temperature distribution in the combustor were simulated and analyzed. Results suggest that the double swirl <b>nozzle</b> and <b>outer</b> swirl <b>nozzle</b> can form a better flow field with obvious central recirculation zone (CRZ), shorten fuel and air mixing distance, and obtain a more uniform outlet temperature distribution, {{in comparison with the}} inner swirl nozzle. However, compared with double swirl <b>nozzle,</b> the <b>outer</b> swirl <b>nozzle</b> can result in a better combustion flow field with the high temperature region in the CRZ, which is important to stabilize the flame...|$|R
40|$|Reynolds-averaged and hybrid Reynolds-averaged/large-eddy {{simulations}} {{have been}} applied to a supersonic coaxial jet flow experiment. The experiment utilized either helium or argon as the inner jet nozzle fluid, and the <b>outer</b> jet <b>nozzle</b> fluid consisted of laboratory air. The inner and <b>outer</b> <b>nozzles</b> were designed and operated to produce nearly pressure-matched Mach 1. 8 flow conditions at the jet exit. The purpose of the computational effort {{was to assess the}} state-of-the-art for each modeling approach, and to use the hybrid Reynolds-averaged/large-eddy simulations to gather insight into the deficiencies of the Reynolds-averaged closure models. The Reynolds-averaged simulations displayed a strong sensitivity to choice of turbulent Schmidt number. The baseline value chosen for this parameter resulted in an over-prediction of the mixing layer spreading rate for the helium case, but the opposite trend was noted when argon was used as the injectant. A larger turbulent Schmidt number greatly improved the comparison of the results with measurements for the helium simulations, but variations in the Schmidt number did not improve the argon comparisons. The hybrid simulation results showed the same trends as the baseline Reynolds-averaged predictions. The primary reason conjectured for the discrepancy between the hybrid simulation results and the measurements centered around issues related to the transition from a Reynolds-averaged state to one with resolved turbulent content. Improvements to the inflow conditions are suggested as a remedy to this dilemma. Comparisons between resolved second-order turbulence statistics and their modeled Reynolds-averaged counterparts were also performed...|$|R

The flow of the cold water is guided by the baffles provided over the tubes; the water is entered at 298  K and atmospheric pressure and it is exited from the shell <b>outer</b> <b>nozzle</b> into atmospheric pressure. Hence, the pressure boundary is defined at the outlet of the shell.|$|E
40|$|Jet {{spreading}} enhancement with {{a certain}} coannular nozzle configuration has been explored. When the <b>outer</b> <b>nozzle</b> is flaired (i. e., made convergent-divergent) the ensuing jet spreads faster than the case where the <b>outer</b> <b>nozzle</b> is convergent. The spreading enhancement is most pronounced when the outer flow is run near 'transonic' condition, in an overexpanded state. Under this condition, the increased spreading takes place regardless of the operating conditions of the inner jet. This observation, first made in a small scale facility, has been confirmed and studied in some detail in a larger-scale facility. Results of the latter experiment are presented in this paper. The spreading increase is shown to be substantial and comparable to or better than that achieved by a lobed nozzle. Estimates based on idealized flow indicate {{that there is an}} accompanying thrust penalty - the actual penalty is expected to be less than the estimate but remains undetermined at this time. In both the earlier and the present experiments, the spreading increase has often been found to accompany a flow resonance. The nature of this resonance is addressed in this paper. It is shown that the spreading increase takes place even if the resonance is absent. Thus, flow excitation due to the resonance is ruled out as the underlying mechanism. While the complete mechanism remains unclear, it is conjectured that pressure gradients near the nozzle, characteristic of overexpanded flow, are {{at the root of the}} phenomenon...|$|E

When model and full-scale spectra of fluctuating surface pressures are reduced to plots of pressure coefficient power-spectral density vs Strouhal number, moderate agreement is obtained, but a shift of spectral peaks is noted.

40|$|An {{inherent}} difficulty {{associated with}} the application of suitable bioscaffolds for tissue engineering is the incorporation of adequate mechanical characteristics into the materials which recapitulate that of the native tissue, whilst maintaining cell proliferation and nutrient transfer qualities. Biomaterial composites fabricated using rapid prototyping techniques can potentially improve the functionality and patient-specific processing of tissue engineering scaffolds. In this work, a technique for the coaxial melt extrusion printing of core-shell scaffold structures was designed, implemented and assessed {{with respect to the}} repeatability, cell efficacy and scaffold porosity obtainable. Encapsulated alginate hydrogel/thermoplastic polycaprolactone (Alg-PCL) cofibre scaffolds were fabricated. Selective laser melting was used to produce a high resolution stainless steel 316 L coaxial extrusion nozzle, exhibiting diameters of 300 ?m/ 900 ?m for the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>nozzles</b> respectively. We present coaxial melt extrusion printed scaffolds of Alg-PCL cofibres with ? 0. 4 volume fraction alginate, with total fibre diameter as low as 600 ?m and core material offset as low as 10 % of the total diameter. Furthermore the tuneability of scaffold porosity, pore size and interconnectivity, as well as the preliminary inclusion, compatibility and survival of an L- 929 mouse fibroblast cell-line within the scaffolds were explored.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{popularity of}} Additive Fabrication (AF) processing techniques {{in recent years}} has catalysed its application {{in a wide range of}} research disciplines. The use of Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) as a technique for the synthesis of functional biomaterial scaffolds for tissue engineering implants epitomises the level of specialisation, as well as the diversity in application, that is possible through the utilisation of an additive approach. While these scaffolds can provide ideal cellular interfaces and be impregnated with growth factors and electrically conducting nanomaterials, the processing itself provides only minimal flexibility with respect to the number of composite materials which can be implemented to reach these targets of function. In this work, a method for the Coaxial Melt Extrusion Printing (CMEP) of multifunctional, conductive and biocompatible co-fibres is presented. This allows for the coupling of two materials into an encapsulated core and shell configuration, and their subsequent extrusion into complex scaffold and path-oriented architectures. Selective Laser Melting was implemented to produce a high resolution stainless steel 316 L coaxial extrusion nozzle, exhibiting diameters of 300 m/ 900 m for the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>nozzles</b> respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{potential}} of a novel 3 -fluid nozzle spray drying technology to formulate differentiated layered microparticles (MPs) of diclofenac sodium (DFS) /ethyl cellulose (EC). METHODS: DFS/EC MPs were formulated using the inner and/or <b>outer</b> <b>nozzles</b> of a novel 3 -fluid nozzle and compared with MPs formed using conventional (2 -fluid) spray drying. MPs were characterised for particle size and for morphology by TEM and SEM. Distribution of DFS and EC of MPs was analysed by FT-IR and DSC. A two-factor, three-level (3 (2)) factorial design was applied to investigate the effect and interaction of total feed solid content (TSC) and feed flow rate (FFR) on MP size, D(50 %) and D(90 %), bulk density and MP yield. RESULTS: Interestingly, TEM demonstrated that MPs formed by 3 -fluid nozzle spray drying showed a heterogeneous internal morphology consisting of a core and coat, characteristic of a microcapsule. In comparison, MPs from conventional spray drying showed a homogeneous internal morphology, characteristics of a matrix system. This differential distribution of DFS/EC was supported by FT-IR and DSC. Results of multiple linear regression analysis showed a linear relationship for the effect of TSC and FFR on all responses except for D(50 %) where a quadratric model was valid. The effect of TSC/FFR on MP size and yield was similar to conventional spray drying. CONCLUSION: The novel 3 -fluid nozzle spray drying offers a new method of designing layered microparticles or microcapsules which can have wide applications from drug stabilisation to controlled drug delivery and targeting...|$|R

40|$|A method {{which shows}} that {{increasing}} the annulus width of a conventional coaxial nozzle with constant bypass velocity will lower the noise level is described. The method entails modifying a concentric coaxial nozzle to provide an eccentric outer stream annulus while maintaining approximately the same through flow as that for the original concentric bypass nozzle. Acoustical tests to determine the noise generating characteristics of the nozzle over a range of flow conditions are described. The tests involved sequentially analyzing the noise signals and digitally recording the 1 / 3 octave band sound pressure levels. The measurements were made in a plane passing through the minimum and maximum annulus width points, {{as well as at}} 90 degrees in this plane, by rotating the <b>outer</b> <b>nozzle</b> about its axis.

40|$|AbstractNumerical {{investigation}} of underexpanded sonic coaxial jets {{was carried out}} using large-eddy simulation. The system consists of two coaxial nozzles, in which one is inner round nozzle and another is outer annular nozzle. Since the pressure ratio of inner to <b>outer</b> <b>nozzle</b> dominates the flow structures and behaviors, two typical pressure ratios 5 / 3 (case A) and 3 / 5 (case B) are considered.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of vortex generation and its contribu-tion to mixing enhancement in a coaxial jet controlled by miniature flap actuators are investigated experimentally and numerically. First, flow visualization and PIV measurement {{are carried out}} in order to study the velocity field induced by the flapping motion of actuators and the resultant vortex ring generation in the initial inner and outer jet shear layers. Then, we numerically simulate such near-field evolution and associated mixing process by assuming the periodic veloc-ity profile of different frequencies at the <b>outer</b> <b>nozzle</b> exit. In addition, the three-dimensional vortical structures and mixing property are studied under two different control con-ditions, i. e., axisymmetric and helical flapping modes. As a result, {{it is found that}} the helical forcing mode generates more streamwise vortices in the shear layers than the ax-isymmetric mode. This enhancement is due to the increased production of rib vortex structures through tilting and sub-sequent stretching of vortices generated by flapping...|$|E
40|$|A general {{empirical}} method, {{developed for}} source noise predictions, uses tensor splines {{to represent the}} dependence of the acoustic field on frequency and direction and Taylor's series to represent the dependence on source state parameters. The method is applied to prediction of mixing noise from subsonic circular and coaxial jets. A noise data base of 1 / 3 -octave-band sound pressure levels (SPL's) from 540 tests was gathered from three countries: United States, United Kingdom, and France. The SPL's depend on seven variables: frequency, polar direction angle, and five source state parameters: inner and <b>outer</b> <b>nozzle</b> pressure ratios, inner and outer stream total temperatures, and nozzle area ratio. A least-squares seven-dimensional curve fit defines a table of constants which {{is used for the}} prediction method. The resulting prediction has a mean error of 0 dB and a standard deviation of 1. 2 dB.

Keeping all other geometrical and operating conditions the same, the exit-stagger of the inner (round) and the <b>outer</b> (annular) <b>nozzles</b> was varied.

For such jets, several families of acoustically coupled instability waves exist, beyond the regular vortical Kelvin-Helmholtz mode, with different shapes and propagation characteristics, which can therefore affect {{the character of}} the radiated sound. In our model, the coaxial shear layers are vortex sheets while the incident acoustic disturbances are the propagating shroud modes. The Wiener-Hopf method is used to compute their scattering at the sharp shroud edge to obtain the far-field radiation.

The obtained nanostructures were morphologically characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The SDZ release profiles and kinetics were analyzed. The SDZ or SCH nanoparticles loosely attached at the surface of the nanofibers, provide a burst release in the first 20 min, which is important to stop the possible initial infection in a wound, while the SDZ and SCH from the nanoparticles which are better confined (or even encapsulated) into the CH nanofibers would be slowly released with the erosion/disruption of the CH nanofiber mesh...|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} for {{the regulation of}} boom sprayers working in circular trajectories has been developed. In this type of trajectory, {{the areas of the}} plots of land treated by the <b>outer</b> <b>nozzles</b> of the boom are treated at reduced rates, and those treated by the inner nozzles are treated in excess. The goal {{of this study was to}} establish the methodology to determine the flow of the individual nozzles on the boom to guarantee that the dose of the product applied per surface unit is similar across the plot. This flow is a function of the position of the equipment (circular trajectory radius) and of the displacement velocity such that the treatment applied per surface unit is uniform. GPS technology was proposed as a basis to establish the position and displacement velocity of the tractor. The viability of this methodology was simulated considering two circular plots with radii of 160 m and 310 m, using three sets of equipment with boom widths of 14. 5, 24. 5 and 29. 5 m. Data showed as increasing boom widths produce bigger errors in the surface dose applied (L/m 2). Error also increases with decreasing plot surface. As an example, considering the three boom widths of 14. 5, 24. 5 and 29. 5 m working on a circular plot with a radius of 160 m, the percentage of surface with errors in the applied surface dose greater than 5 % was 30 %, 58 % and 65 % respectively. Considering a circular plot with radius of 310 m the same errors were 8 %, 22 % and 31 %. To obtain a uniform superficial dose two sprayer regulation alternatives have been simulated considering a 14. 5 m boom: the regulation of the pressure of each nozzle and the regulation of the pressure of each boom section. The viability of implementing the proposed methodology on commercial boom sprayers using GPS antennas to establish the position and displacement velocity of the tractor was justified with a field trial in which a self-guiding commercial GPS system was used along with three precision GPS systems located in the sprayer boom. The use of an unique central GPS unit should allow the estimation of the work parameters of the boom nozzles (including those located at the boom ends) with great accuracy...|$|R

The flow response was sensed using the quantitative schlieren technique, and consistent results were obtained on the basis of both axial and transverse optical beam deflections and appropriate analysis of signal records. The two dominant modes of response were identified as a series of alternating ring disturbances along the flow axis at the higher frequency and a series of alternating ring disturbances containing on axis disturbances of opposite sign at the lower frequency. The former mode was essentially associated with the fuel jet shear layer, whilst the latter was associated with the outer annular shear layer surrounding the air flow from the <b>outer</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The strength of disturbances was consistent with mixing fluctuations between cold fuel gas and the products of combustion. Structures induced in the outer shear layer weakened rapidly with the distance from the nozzle, indicating a relatively sudden breakup of coherent structures caused by the excitation near the nozzle. These results provide conclusive evidence that signal recovery from noise by phase reference to an acoustic excitation is an effective means of determining structures and strength of induced disturbance of diffusion flame. The fractal texture of Propane/ Air diffusion flame were obtained by analysing the fractal distribution of flame schlieren images based on the box counting method which is an efficient method used to analyse the fractal texture of diffusion flame schlieren images with a variance of approximately 0. 04 in the fractal dimension. The results suggest that diffusion flames do exhibit fractal behaviour and that the value of fractal dimension are around of 2. 3 2. 47, which varies with the excitation and character of turbulent flow. The Power Spectrum Density (PSD) of propane/air diffusion flame has also been investigated. These observations of PSD appeared to be generally consistent with the fractal dimensions. A numerical simulation investigation into the fractal relationship between the original field and its schlieren images showed that there is no simple universal relationship between the fractal dimension of the schlieren image and that of the actual spatial field which gave rise to the image. However, it seems that the fractal dimension of the diffusion flame and its schlieren image are similar, whilst the fractal dimension of the schlieren image of a fairly homogeneous turbulent mixing field may exceed that of the field itself appreciably. Contours of differentiated images have potential for revealing any regular character in diffusion flames, the present work showing clear evidence of structures at approximately ± 25 o to the flame axis...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. This experimental study focuses on generation and control of annular impinging jets. An annular nozzle was designed with an active flow control system using twelve radial synthetic jets issuing from the central body of the nozzle. Measurements of the wall pressure and wall mass transfer were performed with air as the working fluid. The control action causes modification of the flowfield resulting in changes of the corresponding heat/mass transfer distributions. The convective transfer rate on the stagnation circle can be demonstrably enhanced by 20 % at a moderate nozzle-to-wall distance, equal to 0. 6 of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>outer</b> diameter. dc 201...|$|R
40|$|The wind {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} code was used to perform a series of analyses on a single-flow plug nozzle with chevrons. Air was injected from tubes tangent to the <b>nozzle</b> <b>outer</b> surface at three different points along the chevron at the nozzle exit: near the chevron notch, at the chevron mid-point, and near the chevron tip. Three injection pressures were used for each injection tube location [...] 10, 30, and 50 psig-giving injection mass flow rates of 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 3 percent of the nozzle mass flow. The results showed subtle changes in the jet plume s turbulence and vorticity structure in the region immediately downstream of the nozzle exit. Distinctive patterns in the plume structure emerged from each injection location, and these became more pronounced as the injection pressure was increased. However, no significant changes in centerline velocity decay or turbulent kinetic energy were observed in the jet plume {{as a result of}} flow injection. Furthermore, computational acoustics calculations performed with the JeNo code showed no real reduction in jet noise relative to the baseline chevron nozzle...|$|R
40|$|Test {{results are}} {{presented}} for a dual throat thruster burning gaseous oxygen and hydrogen at primary (inner) chamber pressures from 380 to 680 psia. Heat flux profiles were obtained from calorimetric cooling channels in the inner <b>nozzle,</b> <b>outer</b> or secondary chamber and {{the tip of the}} inner nozzle. Data were obtained for two nozzle spacings over a chamber pressure ratio (secondary/primary) range of 0. 45 to 0. 83 with both chambers firing (Mode I). Fluxes {{near the end of the}} inner nozzle were significantly higher than in Mode II when only the inner chamber was fired, due to flow separation and recirculation caused by the back pressure imposed by the secondary chamber. As the pressure ratio increased, these heat fluxes increased and the region of high heat flux relative to Mode II extended farther upstream. The use of a gaseous hydrogen bleed flow in the secondary chamber to control heat fluxes in the primary plume attachment region was investigated in Mode II testing. A bleed flow of less than two percent of the primary chamber flow was required...|$|R
40|$|Through {{the use of}} {{theoretical}} predictions of fluid properties and experimental heat transfer and thrust measurements, the zones of laminar, transitional, and turbulent boundary layer flow were defined for the NASA Lewis 1030 : 1 area ratio rocket nozzle. Tests were performed on the nozzle at chamber pressures from 350 to 100 psia. For these conditions, the throat diameter Reynolds numbers varied from 300, 000 to 1 million. The propellants used were gaseous hydrogen and gaseous oxygen. Thrust measurements and <b>nozzle</b> <b>outer</b> wall temperature measurements were taken during the 3 -sec test runs. Comparison of experimental heat transfer and thrust data with the corresponding predictions from the Two-Dimensional Kinetics (TDK) nozzle analysis program indicated laminar flow in the nozzle at a throat diameter Reynolds number of 320, 000 or chamber pressure of 360 psia. Comparison of experimental and predicted heat transfer data indicated transitional flow {{up to and including}} a chamber pressure of 1000 psia. Predicted values of the axisymmetric acceleration parameter within the convergent and divergent nozzle were consistent with the above results. Based upon an extrapolation of the heat transfer data and predicted distributions of the axisymmetric acceleration parameter, transitional flow was predicted up to a throat diameter Reynolds number of 220, 000 or 2600 -psia chamber pressure. Above 2600 -psia chamber pressure, fully developed turbulent flow was predicted...|$|R
