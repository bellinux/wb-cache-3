5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single sufficient interest test for all prerogative <b>orders.</b> <b>In</b> R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, ex parte Cook (1969), for example, the High Court used a sufficient interest test {{to determine whether}} an applicant had standing {{to apply for a}} mandatory order. Singapore followed the UK's move towards a uniform test for all prerogative <b>orders.</b> <b>In</b> Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient interest test for mandatory <b>orders.</b> <b>In</b> that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus (now known as a mandatory order) to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981), held that the test for standing was whether the applicant had a sufficient interest in the subject matter, and not whether he or she had a specific legal right.|$|E
