This opinion polarised people, and the cost of promoting these three bands fell outside of the budget <b>of</b> <b>Jeff’s</b> partner Mike Chadwick, leading to the partnership dissolving - but not before they released one <b>of</b> <b>Jeff’s</b> favourite Heavenly singles, ‘Circles’ by East Village.|$|R

The band sent this tape to various recording companies and played forty-two different showcases for recording industry representatives, including performances for Los Angeles promoter and impresario, Mike Galaxy's showcase at The Gig on Melrose. However, they were initially {{turned down by}} most of the major labels and several independent record labels. The band was signed by Warner Bros.

5|$|The show {{takes place}} at the fictional Greendale Community College in Greendale, Colorado. Harmon based the show on his own {{experiences}} in community college, and partly modeled the character <b>of</b> <b>Jeff</b> Winger on himself. He emphasized the cast's importance to the show, and also credited some of the actors for their improvisational skills. The episode attracted generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised both the actors and the comedy writing. The show received good viewership, and stood out in NBC's Thursday lineup, where the network's other shows suffered declines in ratings.|$|E
5|$|Breakaway is {{the second}} studio album by American singer Kelly Clarkson, {{released}} on November 30, 2004, by RCA Records. The album is a follow-up to her successful debut album, Thankful (2003). Executive produced by Clive Davis, Breakaway sees Clarkson collaborating with various producers and songwriters for the first time, primarily Dr. Luke, Max Martin, John Shanks, Kara DioGuardi, Ben Moody, and David Hodges; the latter two are former members of American rock band Evanescence. Despite the established commercial success of Thankful, music critics still continued to typecast Clarkson as an American Idol winner and were also critical of her attempts of establishing a commercial appeal on her own. Wanting to stray from those, she was convinced by Davis to work with Dr. Luke and Martin in Stockholm, and with Moody and Hodges in Los Angeles, {{in pursuit of a}} pop rock direction. This also led her to part ways with her manager Simon Fuller and hire the management services <b>of</b> <b>Jeff</b> Kwatinetz before the album's release. Breakaway is predominately a pop rock album with elements of rock and soul music, marking a departure from the R sound of Thankful; its lyrics explore themes of heartbreak, love, and escapism.|$|E
5|$|QPR {{continued}} to be outplayed {{for the most part}} by their First Division opponents. In the twenty fifth minute, Clark once again ran with the ball down the left hand side of the pitch, outrunning QPR's Ron Hunt, before crossing it into the path <b>of</b> <b>Jeff</b> Astle. His subsequent shot was saved by QPR goalkeeper Peter Springett, who managed to push the ball around the post. QPR briefly had a chance for a counterattack as Mark Lazarus found himself on the halfway line with the ball, before taking it around Ian Collard and found the Albion defence out of position, leaving him with a clear path to goal. But the opposition players were gaining on him as he approached the penalty area, with the attack falling apart shortly afterwards. Nine minutes before half time, QPR found themselves under attack by Albion again with some cross pitch passing resulting in Clark's second goal of the game. QPR had a corner just before half time which fell to the feet of club captain Mike Keen, but his shot went off the post. The game went into half time at 2–0 to Albion.|$|E

5|$|The CFL re-gained {{relative}} {{stability in the}} 2000s, mostly thanks to enforcement of a salary cap, stricter standards of ownership, and increasingly lucrative television contracts negotiated with Canadian networks. The league has remained solely focused on its Canadian operations, with expansion efforts focused on returning a stable team to Ottawa. The first attempt at a replacement for the Rough Riders, the Ottawa Renegades, played from 2002 to 2005; in its last season, despite league resistance but without any other buyers, the Gliebermans purchased the franchise, then gave {{it back to the}} league, which suspended it prior to the 2006 season. After an extended delay due to stadium problems in Ottawa, the Ottawa Redblacks, who own the Rough Riders' history and trademarks, launched in 2014 and have so far been a success under the ownership <b>of</b> <b>Jeff</b> Hunt's consortium. Further expansion has been limited to one-off games such as Touchdown Atlantic and Northern Kickoff in more distant Canadian markets.|$|E
5|$|The finish to {{the main}} event and the segment after the Last Man Standing match led to several matches and {{segments}} following Hard Justice. Sting was announced at No Surrender to be the challenger for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at TNA's Bound for Glory IV PPV event on October12. Sting ended up defeating Joe for the title at the event due to Nash betraying and hitting Joe with a baseball bat. Styles went on to challenge Sting at TNA's Turning Point and Final Resolution PPV events for the title, failing to win on both occasions. These matches {{were part of a}} storyline between veterans wrestlers, which made up The Main Event Mafia, and younger wrestlers, called The TNA Front Line, in TNA. Meanwhile, the finish of the main event led to the return <b>of</b> <b>Jeff</b> Jarrett at No Surrender, when he aided Joe in retaining the TNA World Heavyweight Championship by hitting Angle with a guitar.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Final Resolution was a Tag Team match pitting {{the team of}} Christian Cage and Sting against the team <b>of</b> <b>Jeff</b> Jarrett and Monty Brown. The {{background}} to this match began at TNA's Genesis PPV event on November13, 2005 where Cage made his debut proclaiming he wanted to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship held by Jarrett. TNA advertised a major announcement to take place at their previous PPV event Turning Point on December11, 2005. The announcement was the acquisition of Sting as a newly signed wrestler to the TNA roster. Cage {{then went on to}} defeat Brown at Turning Point to become number-one contender to the title. This match was announced on the December31, 2005 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!.|$|E
