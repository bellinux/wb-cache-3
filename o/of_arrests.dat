5|$|Rioting {{broke out}} in Tottenham again in August 2011, after the police shot and killed a local man, Mark Duggan (1981–2011), believing that he was armed. Violence and looting spread {{throughout}} England for several days, leading to five deaths and thousands <b>of</b> <b>arrests.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Polish victory infuriated the Soviets, {{leading to}} dozens <b>of</b> <b>arrests</b> and several executions among those {{connected}} to the Lit-Bel.; the former Lit-Bel leaders began accusing one another of culpability {{for the loss of}} their capital. Lenin considered the city vital to his plans, and ordered its immediate recapture, with the Red Army attempting several counteroffensives in April 1919.|$|E
5|$|In late 1937, Stalin {{appointed}} Khrushchev {{as head of}} the Communist Party in Ukraine, and Khrushchev duly left Moscow for Kiev, {{again the}} Ukrainian capital, in January 1938. Ukraine had been the site of extensive purges, with the murdered including professors in Stalino whom Khrushchev greatly respected. The high ranks of the Party were not immune; the Central Committee of Ukraine was so devastated that it could not convene a quorum. After Khrushchev's arrival, the pace <b>of</b> <b>arrests</b> accelerated. All but one member of the Ukrainian Politburo Organizational Bureau and Secretariat were arrested. Almost all government officials and Red Army commanders were replaced. During the first few months after Khrushchev's arrival, almost everyone arrested received the death penalty.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by the {{regional}} Arab Spring, Bahrain's Shia majority started large protests against its Sunni rulers in early 2011. The government initially allowed protests following a pre-dawn raid on protesters camped in Pearl Roundabout. A month later it requested security assistance from Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries and declared a three-month state of emergency. The government then launched {{a crackdown on}} the opposition that included conducting thousands <b>of</b> <b>arrests</b> and systematic torture. Almost daily clashes between protesters and security forces led to dozens of deaths. Protests, sometimes staged by opposition parties, were ongoing. More than 80 civilians and 13 policemen have been killed as of March 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church was persecuted {{under the}} Third Reich, with the Nazi {{leadership}} hoping to gradually de-Christianize Germany. Political Catholicism was {{a target of}} Hitler's 1934 Night of the Long Knives. German clergy, nuns and lay leaders were also targeted after the Nazi takeover, leading to thousands <b>of</b> <b>arrests</b> over the following years. Priests {{who were part of}} the Catholic resistance were killed. Hitler's invasion of Catholic Poland in 1939 began World War II, and the Nazis targeted clergy, monks and nuns in their campaign to destroy Polish culture.|$|E
5|$|The DDoS {{attacks were}} at first {{carried out with}} the Gigaloader and JMeter {{application}}s. Within a few days, these were supplanted by the Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC), a network stress-testing application allowing users to flood a server with TCP or UDP packets. The LOIC soon became a signature weapon in the Anonymous arsenal; however, it would also lead to a number <b>of</b> <b>arrests</b> of less experienced Anons who failed to conceal their IP addresses. Some operators in Anonymous IRC channels incorrectly told or lied to new volunteers that using the LOIC carried no legal risk.|$|E
40|$|This report {{identifies}} the powers <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> currently available in Tasmania and the arrest laws that frame such powers.  It {{shows that there}} has been a proliferation <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> powers and that this has caused arrest laws in Tasmania to be unnecessarily complex, inconsistent and uncertain. The Report contains a number of recommendations relating to the consolidation, clarification and simplification of the powers <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> in Tasmania. Recommendations include that arrest powers in Tasmania be consolidated into one statute and that the distinction between arrestable and non-arrestable offences be eliminated.   The Report also contains a number of recommendations that relate to the introduction of protective provisions for vulnerable persons and that relate to the process <b>of</b> <b>arrest.</b> The Report makes a number of recommendations in relation to the use of force, entry to private premises, the use <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> warrants and private citizens’ power <b>of</b> <b>arrest.</b> Image: mr. smashy / flick...|$|R
50|$|Originally, powers <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> were {{confined}} to sheriffs in England for a local area.

40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} belief updating of {{the perceived}} probability <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> and its criminal deterrence effects using two longitudinal data sources. While beliefs about the probability <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> are positively correlated with local official arrest rates, they are unresponsive to information acquired from random individuals and local neighborhood conditions. Importantly, perceptions respond to changes in an individual's criminal and arrest history. Young males who engage in crime without getting arrested revise their perceived probability <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> downward, while those who are arrested revise their probability upward. Estimates suggest that beliefs about the probability <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> significantly deter crime. (JEL K 42) ...|$|R
5|$|In 1897 an Italian anarchist assassinated Prime Minister Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, {{motivated}} by a growing number <b>of</b> <b>arrests</b> {{and the use of}} torture by the government. The loss of Cuba, Spain's last valuable colony, in the Spanish–American War of 1898 hit exports from Catalonia hardest; there were acts of terrorism and actions by agents provocateurs in Barcelona. In the first two decades of the 20th century, the industrial working class grew in number. There was a growing discontent in the Basque country and Catalonia, where much of Spain's industry was based. They believed that the government favoured agrarianism and therefore failed to represent their interests. The average illiteracy rate was 64%, with considerable regional variation. Poverty in some areas was great and mass emigration to the New World occurred {{in the first decade of}} the century.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{was born}} in 1894 {{in the village of}} Kalinovka, which is close to the present-day border between Russia and Ukraine. He was {{employed}} as a metal worker during his youth, and he was a political commissar during the Russian Civil War. With the help of Lazar Kaganovich, he worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy. He supported Joseph Stalin's purges, and approved thousands <b>of</b> <b>arrests.</b> In 1938, Stalin sent him to govern Ukraine, and he continued the purges there. During what was known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War (Eastern Front of World War II), Khrushchev was again a commissar, serving as an intermediary between Stalin and his generals. Khrushchev was present at the bloody defense of Stalingrad, a fact he took great pride in throughout his life. After the war, he returned to Ukraine before being recalled to Moscow as one of Stalin's close advisers.|$|E
5|$|Over 300 {{more people}} were {{reported}} arrested in early August. According to the BBC, the total number <b>of</b> <b>arrests</b> {{in connection with the}} riots was over 1,500. The Financial Times estimated that the number was higher, citing an insider saying that some 4,000 arrests had already taken place by mid July, and that Ürümqi's prisons were so full that newly arrested people were being held in a People's Liberation Army warehouse. According to the Uyghur American Association, several other Uyghur journalists and bloggers were also detained after the riots; one of them, journalist Gheyret Niyaz, was later sentenced to 15 years in prison for having spoken to foreign media. In the most high-profile case, Ilham Tohti, an ethnic Uyghur economist at Minzu University of China, was arrested two days after the riots over his criticisms of the Xinjiang government.|$|E

5|$|Republicans {{around the}} state {{expected}} the committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Additional armed men from eastern Kentucky filled the capital. Taylor, recognizing that the slightest incident could lead to violence, ordered the men home, {{and many of them}} complied. Still, two or three hundred remained, awaiting the election committee's findings. Others remained as witnesses set to testify before the contest committee. Some of these Republican witnesses were arrested by local police, who were mostly Goebel partisans. Governor Taylor issued pardons for some of them, citing their claims that the police robbed them upon their arrest. To avoid arrest for carrying a concealed weapon, many of the Republican partisans began wearing their guns openly, adding to the tensions in the city, but effectively reducing the number <b>of</b> <b>arrests</b> by local police.|$|E
5|$|Persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany {{followed}} the Nazi takeover. Hitler {{moved quickly to}} eliminate political Catholicism, rounding up functionaries of the Catholic-aligned Bavarian People's Party and Catholic Centre Party, which along with all other non-Nazi political parties ceased to exist by July. The Reichskonkordat (Reich Concordat) treaty with the Vatican was signed in 1933, amid continuing harassment {{of the church in}} Germany. The treaty required the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics. Hitler routinely disregarded the Concordat, closing all Catholic institutions whose functions were not strictly religious. Clergy, nuns and lay leaders were targeted, with thousands <b>of</b> <b>arrests</b> over the ensuing years, often on trumped-up charges of currency smuggling or immorality. Several high-profile Catholic lay leaders were targeted in the 1934 Night of the Long Knives assassinations. Most Catholic youth groups refused to dissolve themselves and Hitler Youth leader Baldur von Schirach encouraged members to attack Catholic boys in the streets. Propaganda campaigns claimed the church was corrupt, restrictions were placed on public meetings and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings.|$|E
5|$|The strike {{involved}} {{three of}} the province's four major copper mines: the mines at Mufulira, Nkana and Roan Antelope. On the morning of 21 May 1935, police at Mulfulira announced that taxes were raised from 12 to 15 shillings a year. The strike was spontaneous, with morning-shift miners refusing to go underground. It was led by three Zambians from the Northern Province: William Sankata, Ngostino Mwamba and James Mutali at the Mufulira mine. The other African miners refused to report to work, shouted slogans against the authorities and threw stones at them and non-supportive Africans. At the other two mines, the strike was less spontaneous than at Mufulira (where the tax increase was received with disbelief) and police arrested leaders as a precautionary measure. News of the Mufulira strike spread {{to the other two}} mines with the inflow of miners from Mufulira. Beni dancers, who developed the dance form during the colonial era and who mimicked military and colonial administration with music and aesthetic expression, were instrumental in structured communication during the strike. African workers went on strike in Nkana on 27 May, but it failed and ended the following day due to poor leadership. The strike at Roan Antelope, where some tribal leaders participated, turned violent. On 29 May, a large crowd gathered around the compound containing police, officials, clerks and elders; protesters began throwing stones and shouting slogans. The police panicked and fired, leading to the deaths of six protesters and injuring 17 others. Shocked at the shootout, the strikers called off the strike. According to a UNESCO International Scientific Committee report, organized demonstrations were held on 22 May at the Mulfra mine and spread to Nkana on 26 May and the Luansha mines on 28 May. Casualties were reported as 28 killed or injured, with an unspecified number <b>of</b> <b>arrests.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Data {{reflecting}} {{cardiopulmonary resuscitation}} (CPR) efforts in Saudi Arabia are limited. In this study, we analyzed the characteristics, and estimated the outcome, of in-hospital CPR in a teaching hospital in Saudi Arabia over 4 years. Methods: A retrospective, observational {{study was conducted}} between January 2009 and December 2012 and included 4361 patients with sudden cardiopulmonary arrest. Resuscitation forms were reviewed. Demographic data, resuscitation characteristics, and survival outcomes were recorded. Results: The mean ± standard deviation age <b>of</b> <b>arrested</b> patient was 40 ± 31 years. The immediate survival rate was 64 %, 43 % at 24 h, and 30 % at discharge. The death rate was 70 %. Respiratory type <b>of</b> <b>arrest,</b> time and place <b>of</b> <b>arrest,</b> short duration <b>of</b> <b>arrest,</b> witnessed <b>arrest,</b> the use <b>of</b> epinephrine and atropine boluses, and shockable arrhythmias were associated with higher 24 -h survival rates. A low survival rate was found among patients with cardiac types <b>of</b> <b>arrest,</b> and those with a longer duration <b>of</b> <b>arrest,</b> pulseless electrical activity, and asystole. Comorbidities were present in 3786 patients with cardiac arrest and contributed to a poor survival rate (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: The study confirms the findings of previously published studies in highly developed countries and provides some reflection on the practice of resuscitation in Saudi Arabia...|$|R
