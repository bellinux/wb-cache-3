5|$|To {{minimize}} Soviet opposition, Norway {{attempted to}} move the debate from the political to the specialist scene, {{while at the same}} time establishing a protocol for Norwegian control and operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facility.</b> To achieve this, Norwegian authorities worked towards establishing an inspection procedure to insure that the facilities remained solely used for 'peaceful activities'. This would particularly focus on the regular inspection of auxiliary equipment. To depoliticize the issue further, the government appointed the semi-independent NTNF as the operator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facility.</b> The first oral consultations between the Soviet embassy and the Norwegian government took place in November 1964.|$|E

Along the way, he activates a rocket engine test facility to destroy a giant tentacled creature and uses a disused railway system to reach and launch a satellite rocket.
