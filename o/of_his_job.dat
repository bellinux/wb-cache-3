40|$|Two agents, each having <b>his</b> own set <b>of</b> <b>jobs,</b> {{compete to}} perform their own jobs on a common {{processing}} resource.

The cost of the first agent is the maximum weighted completion time <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jobs</b> while {{the cost of the}} second agent is the total weighted completion time <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jobs.</b> We consider the scheduling problem of determining the sequence of the jobs such that the total cost of the two agents is minimized. We provide a 2 -approximation algorithm for the problem, show that the case where the number of jobs of the first agent is fixed is NP-hard, and devise a polynomial time approximation scheme for this case.

Much of the effort went into completing it perfectly, however at the end of the first day, Angie and Johnnie had only few of the challenges complete, while Brian and Eric were more than halfway through the list. After the group challenge took up the morning of the second day, Angie had completed her entire list, Brian had finished nearly all <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jobs,</b> Eric still had about a quarter <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jobs</b> unfinished, while Johnnie was in last place by a large margin, having finished just three jobs.|$|R

The men traveled around Indiana creating large billboard-like signs on the sides of buildings and barns and in high places that would be visible from a distance. The company was financially successful, but Riley was continually drawn to poetry. In October he traveled to South Bend where he took a job at Stockford & Blowney painting verses on signs for a month; the short duration <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> may have been due to his frequent drunkenness at that time.|$|E
5|$|As it {{is clear}} that the demands <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> are taking a toll on Chris, Carla becomes {{increasingly}} uncomfortable with the brutal competition among firms and the violence they incite in other countries.

This position is viewed as honourable but ultimately ineffective as neither the US nor UK recognise the UN's authority and run roughshod over them in their pursuit of profits. After an initially frosty meeting, Chris' conditions are agreed on, but with the requirement that he stay in place at Shorn through the end of the current conflict in Cambodia, in which Shorn is backing a rebel leader.|$|E
