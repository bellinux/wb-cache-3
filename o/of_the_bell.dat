5|$|Japanese temple bells are struck {{externally}} {{with either}} a hammer or a suspended beam rather than with an internal clapper. The sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> {{is made up of}} three parts. First is the atari, the impact of the strike. A well-made bell should produce a clean, clear tone. The initial sound of the strike is immediately followed by the prolonged oshi, the reverberation that continues to sound after the bell is struck. This is higher in pitch and is a low rumble with a sorrowful air, rich in harmonics; it lasts for up to ten seconds. Finally comes the okuri or decay, the resonance that is heard as the vibration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> dies away, which can last up to a minute. There are also continuous harmonic overtones heard throughout the tolling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell.</b> These multiple tones create a complex pitch profile.|$|E

5|$|Medusae swim by {{a form of}} jet propulsion: muscles, {{especially}} {{inside the}} rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell,</b> squeeze {{water out of the}} cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, {{the city}} allowed the National Park Service to take custody <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell,</b> while {{retaining}} ownership. The bell {{was used as}} a symbol of freedom during the Cold War and was a popular site for protests in the 1960s. It was moved from its longtime home in Independence Hall to a nearby glass pavilion on Independence Mall in 1976, and then to the larger Liberty Bell Center adjacent to the pavilion in 2003. The bell has been featured on coins and stamps, and its name and image have been widely used by corporations.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath has one museum, {{the former}} Bell Rock Lighthouse Signal Tower. In 1807 Arbroath became {{the base of}} {{operations}} for the building <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bell</b> Rock Lighthouse. The shore station for the lighthouse – the Bell Rock Signal Tower – was completed in 1813 and acted as a lifeline for the keepers offshore. Signal Tower Museum was opened in 1974 as a visitor centre detailing the history of the lighthouse and the town of Arbroath.|$|E

5|$|In 1890, Menage {{sponsored}} a scientific {{expedition to the}} Philippines {{in partnership with the}} Minnesota Academy of Natural Sciences. The expedition, led primarily by Dean Conant Worcester and Frank Swift Bourns, collected thousands of specimens of birds and animals; some, such as the Philippine slow loris (Nycticebus menagensis) and the Sulu bleeding-heart (Gallicolumba menagei), were named in honor of Menage. While many of the specimens from the expedition appear to have been lost or discarded, some remain in the collections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bell</b> Museum of Natural History and the Field Museum of Natural History.|$|E
5|$|Some parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bell</b> Hill cutting {{are still}} visible from Princes Street, though {{the most obvious}} {{escarpment}} of the hill is found between Moray Place and Queen's Gardens, close to First Church. From Princes Street, the most notable part of the cutting is at Dowling Street, 300 metres south of the Octagon. Dowling Street narrows significantly above this intersection. The Dowling Street Steps, a 1926 structure listed by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, rise from close to the Princes Street-Dowling Street intersection, ascending a cliff that was formed {{as a result of}} the original work on Bell Hill.|$|E
5|$|The Bell 212 is {{the primary}} {{helicopter}} used for flights to district villages. The older Sikorsky S-61N machines are stationed in Ilulissat Airport and Qaqortoq Heliport. With a capacity to seat 25 passengers, the S-61 based in southern Greenland was used to shuttle passengers arriving from Copenhagen at Narsarsuaq Airport. The sale of the Boeing 757 in April 2010 contributed to the long-term decline of the airport, with the airline planning to remove the old helicopter from the fleet. Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bell</b> 222 helicopters are taken out of active service and remain stationed in Kangerlussuaq Airport having been put up for sale.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps {{were given}} the lead in 1983. The JVX {{combined}} requirements from the U.S. Marine Corps, Air Force, Army and Navy. A request for proposals (RFP) was issued in December 1982 for preliminary design work. Interest was expressed by Aérospatiale, Bell Helicopter, Boeing Vertol, Grumman, Lockheed, and Westland. Contractors were encouraged to form teams. Bell partnered with Boeing Vertol to submit a proposal for an enlarged version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bell</b> XV-15 prototype on 17 February 1983. Being the only proposal received, a preliminary design contract was awarded on 26 April 1983.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} an {{individual}} – signified by the tolling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> – is thus a treasure buried {{at the bottom of}} a mine: only of value if it is given to someone who makes good use of it. In this he refers to the work of Augustine of Hippo, specifically On Christian Doctrine, in which Augustine describes the knowledge of pagans as gold and silver: something that can be involved in Christian purposes if appropriated properly. Donne, twisting this idea, is arguing that the {{death of an}}y individual is something others can learn from, should they understand it properly.|$|E
5|$|The fan {{press and}} fandom grew {{throughout}} this period, and was bolstered when Patrick Loubert and Michael Hirsh, {{the founders of}} the animation company Nelvana, published of The Great Canadian Comic Books in 1971, a book-length study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bell</b> Features comics, and the touring of a related exhibition mounted by the National Gallery of Canada, Comic Art Traditions in Canada, 1941-45, which together served to introduce English-Canadian comics creators and fans to their lost heritage.|$|E

5|$|The sonorous sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> {{was also}} used to warn of {{impending}} typhoons and as a general alert. Because the ringing of a temple bell could be heard over considerable distances, it was also sometimes used for other signalling purposes; there are records of temple bells being used for military communication from {{as far back as}} the Genpei War (1180–1185 CE). Smaller versions were subsequently cast for battlefield use, as the large temple bells were too heavy and unwieldy to transport. These smaller bonshō were used primarily as alarms to warn of enemy attacks; commands were given using drums and conches.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, and {{following}} considerable controversy, the City of Philadelphia {{agreed that it}} would transfer custody <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> and Independence Hall, while retaining ownership, to the federal government. The city would also transfer various colonial-era buildings it owned. Congress agreed to the transfer in 1948, and three years later Independence National Historical Park was founded, incorporating those properties and administered by the National Park Service (NPS or Park Service). The Park Service {{would be responsible for}} maintaining and displaying the bell. The NPS would also administer the three blocks just north of Independence Hall, which had been condemned by the state, razed, and developed into a park, Independence Mall.|$|E
5|$|During the 1870s ice {{began to}} be used by Timothy Eastman, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bell</b> Brothers firm, to {{transport}} American meat to Britain; the first shipment successfully arrived in 1875 and by the following year 9,888 tons (8,909,000kg) of meat was shipped. The chilled meat was retailed through special warehouses and stores. There was concern in Britain that chilled American meat might flood the market and harm domestic farmers, but the exports continued. The rival Chicago-based meat firms of Armour and Swift entered the refrigerated meat transport market in the late 1870, establishing their own fleet of refrigerator cars, network of icing stations and other infrastructure, increasing the sales of chilled Chicago beef to the eastern seaboard from 15,680 tons (14,128,000kg) a year in 1880, to 173,067 tons (155,933,000kg) in 1884.|$|E
