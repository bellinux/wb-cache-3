40|$|AbstractUntreated {{produced}} water contains numerous substances {{that can cause}} {{harm to the environment}} such as dispersed and dissolved oil, heavy metals, and production chemicals. Dispersed oil content in {{produced water}} may vary with different oil wells. Dispersed oil in water is classified as toxicants to human beings and marine life. The focus of doing this research is to study the oil adsorption characteristics of dried Khaya Senegalensis leaves in produced water and to investigate the effect of temperature on oil adsorption efficiency of the dried leaves. Khaya Senegalensis dried leaves were chosen for the research because they are considered as natural waste that exist in abundance in the environment. The results from SEM analysis showed that adsorbed <b>oil</b> <b>patches</b> appeared {{on the surface of the}} leaves. This is due to the leaves’ rich phytochemical constituents which is lipophilic in nature. However, an increase in temperature of the solution will result in the decrease in the number of adsorbed <b>oil</b> <b>patches</b> on the surface of the leaves. This is due to the leaching of these phytochemical constituents into the surrounding solution which reduces oil adsorption efficiency of the dried leaves...|$|R

We enrolled 370 patients with traumatic TM perforations of different sizes. These patients were randomly assigned to control group and treatment group. In the treatment group, a sterile cotton patch with sea buckthorn oil was used to cover the TM perforations. In the control group, patients were treated with a sterile cotton patch. The healing rate and time were compared between the two groups. We found that the overall healing rate was significantly higher in the treatment group than in the control group. For middle and large TM perforations, sea buckthorn oil treatment led to {{a significant increase in the}} healing rate. At 2 months after injury, the duration of healing was, generally, shorter in the treatment group than in the control group (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, sea buckthorn <b>oil</b> <b>patches</b> are effective in treating middle and large TM perforations, which results in increased healing rates and decreased healing time.

40|$|A very mysterious spill was {{recently}} discovered near the Istrian peninsula. Immediate response action was launched and later successful oil recovery was announced. Late that same afternoon, after the announced recovery, some <b>oil</b> <b>patches</b> were found along the coast. Four different images were analyzed - {{three of them}} acquired by optical sensor and one with radar. The {{size and shape of}} the fingerprint as well as the oil's weathered condition suggested that this could be more extensive pollution, the initial release location still unknown, as well as the quantity, carrying the possibility that oil remained below the surface, and that thus further impact on the coast was possible. Three days later, an unusually intense storm hit the area, and part of the hidden/sunken oil beached on the coast 10 Nm north of the initial location where the oil reached the coast. Based on the described case study, integration of an spill area derived from the satellite images, with HF measured currents and AIS shipping database supporting the backtracking oil spill application will be demonstrated as an appropriate system for the purpose of polluter identification.

40|$|Hydrographic data {{collected}} during the cruise HIDROPRESTIGE were combined with meteorological and dynamic data provided by remote sensors and drifting/moored buoys, to describe the surface circulation of the Northern Iberian basin in March–April 2003. Sea surface winds transported the floating Prestige oil slicks from the sinking area to the continental slope off the Rías Baixas in 1 / 2 month: the surface current intensity was 2 % of the wind intensity and it was rotated clockwise 5 from the wind direction.

40|$|Tar balls, the little, dark-colored {{pieces of}} oil that stick to our feet {{when we go}} to the beach, are {{actually}} remnants of oil spills. When crude oil (or a heavier refined product) floats on the ocean surface, its physical characteristics change. During the first few hours of a spill, the oil spreads into a thin slick. Winds and waves tear the slick into smaller patches that are scattered over a much wider area Various physical, chemical, and biological processes change the appearance of the oil. These processes are generally called “weathering. ” Initially, the lighter components of the oil evaporate much like a small gasoline spill. In the cases of heavier types of oil, such as crude oil or home heating oil, much of the oil remains behind. At the same time, some crude oils mix with water to form an emulsion that often looks like chocolate pudding. This emulsion is much thicker and stickier than the original oil. Winds and waves continue to stretch and tear the <b>oil</b> <b>patches</b> into smaller pieces, or tar balls. While some tar balls may be as large as pancakes, most are coin-sized.
