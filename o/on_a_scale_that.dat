(If a destination station is full, riders can use the kiosk to get 15 more free minutes to return the bike to another location.) Longer trips incur fees for each additional half-hour <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> rises from $1.50 to $8.00. These prices are designed to encourage short trips {{from place to place}} instead of longer leisure rides.|$|E

However they are used by other organizations, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. An example of such scale is the Integrated Kinetic Energy index, which {{measures}} the destructive potential of the storm surge; it works <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> ranges from one to six, with six having the highest destructive potential.|$|E

25|$|The most {{commonly}} used method of calculation is that originally proposed by Linus Pauling. This gives a dimensionless quantity, {{commonly referred to as}} the Pauling scale (χr), on a relative scale running from around 0.7 to 3.98 (hydrogen= 2.20). When other methods of calculation are used, it is conventional (although not obligatory) to quote the results <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> covers the same range of numerical values: this is known as an electronegativity in Pauling units.|$|E
25|$|The {{scale of}} {{destruction}} and devastation was unprecedented: treasures, art collections, scrolls from the imperial library and human lives were lost <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> the Chinese {{had never seen}} before. Due to the heavy damage to the country's economy and military, {{and the loss of}} talented manpower, the Southern Song dynasty did not recover the lost territories, despite constant fighting between the Song and Jin, the territory was ruled by non-Han Chinese emperors. It would take another 200 years, until the Ming dynasty, to claim back all the territories that the Song dynasty lost.|$|E
25|$|The 99th as a whole, outnumbered five to one, inflicted {{casualties}} at a {{ratio of}} eighteen to one. They devastated the attacking Volksgrenadier formations. The 99th lost about 20% of its effective strength, including 465 killed and 2,524 evacuated due to wounds, injuries, fatigue, or trench foot. German losses were much higher. In the northern sector opposite the 99th, this included deaths <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> routed the attacking infantry, and included the destruction of many tanks and assault guns. This performance prevented the Sixth Panzer Army from outflanking Elsenborn Ridge, and resulted in many commendations and unit citations for the 99th.|$|E

25|$|Wind power {{offers a}} {{reliability}} benefit in that its generation (though not its transmission) is highly decentralized. Sabotage and industrial accidents can be potential {{threats to the}} large, centrally located, power plants that provide most of Texas’ electricity. Should one of these plants be damaged, repairs could {{take more than a}} year, possibly creating power shortages <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> Texans have never experienced before. Coal trains and gas pipelines are also vulnerable to disruption. However, wind power plants are quickly installed and repaired. The modular structure of a wind farm also means that if one turbine is damaged, the overall output of the plant is not significantly affected.|$|E
25|$|Egg {{collecting}} {{for food}} {{on a massive}} scale was frequent in the past but is now outlawed. It is to be noted that the sooty terns for example could sustain occasional collection of effectively all of a season's eggs (over 10 million), if given sufficient time to recover and if cats are absent. Even egg collecting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> significantly decreases costly food imports thus in theory could be possible, but not until the cat and rat populations have been brought under control. Poaching remains a concern; with the population rising and spreading out on Kiritimati, formerly remote bird colonies became more accessible and especially the red-tailed tropicbirds and the Sula are strongly affected by hunting and disturbance. Tropicbirds are mainly poached for their feathers which are used in local arts and handicraft; it would certainly be possible to obtain them from living birds as it was routinely done {{at the height of the}} Polynesian civilization.|$|E
25|$|Cooper felt Creelman's {{final draft}} was slow-paced, {{too full of}} flowery dialogue, weighted-down with long scenes of exposition, and written <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> would have been prohibitively {{expensive}} to film. Writer Ruth Rose (Schoedsack's wife) {{was brought in to}} for rewrites and, although she had never written a screenplay, undertook the task with a complete understanding of Cooper's style, streamlining the script and tightening the action. Rather than explaining how Kong would be transported to New York, for example, she simply cut from the island to the theater. She incorporated autobiographical elements into the script with Cooper mirrored in the Denham character, her husband Schoedsack in the tough but tender Driscoll character, and herself in struggling actress Ann Darrow. Rose also rewrote the dialogue and created the film's opening sequence, showing Denham meeting Ann on the streets of New York. Cooper was delighted with Rose's script, approving the newly re-titled Kong for production. Cooper and Schoedsack decided to co-direct scenes but their styles were different (Cooper was slow and meticulous, Schoedsack brisk) and they finally agreed to work separately, with Cooper overseeing O'Brien's miniature work and directing the special effects sequences, and Schoedsack directing the dialogue scenes.|$|E

500|$|The game {{utilizes}} a new in-house engine {{called the}} Northlight Engine. To represent {{the idea of}} [...] "broken time" [...] and have a detailed destruction system, the team created lots of environments which put the player character {{in the midst of}} destruction, utilizing technologies ranging from geometric distortion waves to Thinking Particles. The team also used Digital Molecular Matter, a technology developed by Pixelux that allows structures and objects to react in the game the same way they would in reality. According to Mikko Uromo, the technology allows them to [...] "simulate complex scenarios <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> hasn't been possible before" [...] and is crucial to the game's development. The team also worked significantly on the game's lighting system. It was designed to be dynamic, and the team refined it to include eyes and hair. They also created a new global illumination system for indirect lighting. The game's resolution foundation was 720p, but Remedy attempted to raise it to 1080p by using temporal reconstruction.|$|E

His site-specific works challenge viewers’ perception of their bodies in relation to interior spaces and landscapes, and his work often encourages movement in and around his sculptures. Most famous is the [...] "Torqued Ellipse" [...] series, which began in 1996 as single elliptical forms inspired by the soaring space of the early 17th century Baroque church San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane in Rome. Made of huge steel plates bent into circular sculptures with open tops, they rotate upward as they lean in or out.|$|E

2500|$|Now {{that there}} was an {{aggressive}} general in the field, Halleck's administrative capabilities complemented Grant nicely and they worked well together. Throughout the arduous Overland Campaign and Richmond-Petersburg Campaign of 1864, Halleck saw to it that Grant was properly supplied, equipped, and reinforced <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> wore down the Confederates. He agreed with Grant and Sherman on the implementation of a hard war toward the Southern economy and endorsed both Sherman's March to the Sea and Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan's destruction of the Shenandoah Valley. However, the 1864 Red River Campaign, a doomed attempt to occupy Eastern Texas, had been advocated by Halleck, over the objections of Nathaniel P. Banks, who commanded the operation. When the campaign failed, Halleck claimed to Grant that it had been Banks' idea in the first place, not his [...] - [...] an example of Halleck's habit of deflecting blame.|$|E
2500|$|Wall Street {{itself and}} the Financial District as a whole are crowded with highrises. Further, {{the loss of the}} World Trade Center has spurred {{development}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> had not been seen in decades. In 2006, Goldman Sachs began building a tower near the former Trade Center site. Tax incentives provided by federal, state and local governments encouraged development. A new World Trade Center complex centered on Daniel Libeskind's Memory Foundations plan is under development, the centerpiece of which is the [...] tall One World Trade Center that opened in 2014. New residential buildings are sprouting up, and buildings that were previously office space are being converted to residential units, also benefiting from tax incentives. A new Fulton Center is planned to improve access. In 2007, the Maharishi Global Financial Capital of New York opened headquarters at 70 Broad Street near the NYSE, in an effort to seek investors.|$|E
2500|$|In mathematics, a {{negative}} number {{is a real}} number that is less than zero. [...] Negative numbers represent opposites. [...] If positive represents movement to the right, negative represents movement to the left. [...] If positive represents above sea level, then negative represents below level. [...] If positive represents a deposit, negative represents a withdrawal. [...] They are often used to represent the magnitude of a loss or deficiency. [...] A debt that is owed may {{be thought of as}} {{a negative}} asset, a decrease in some quantity may {{be thought of as a}} negative increase. [...] If a quantity may have either of two opposite senses, then one may choose to distinguish between those senses—perhaps arbitrarily—as positive and negative. [...] In the medical context of fighting a tumor, an expansion could be thought of as a negative shrinkage. [...] Negative numbers are used to describe values <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> goes below zero, such as the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales for temperature. [...] The laws of arithmetic for negative numbers ensure that the common sense idea of an opposite is reflected in arithmetic. [...] For example, − − 3 = 3 because the opposite of an opposite is the original thing.|$|E
