40|$|Usually it {{is assumed}} that the {{supplier}} would offer a fixed credit period to the retailer but the retailer in turn would not <b>offer</b> any credit <b>period</b> to its customers, which is unrealistic, because in real practice retailer might <b>offer</b> a credit <b>period</b> to its customers in order to stimulate his own demand. Moreover, it is observed that credit <b>period</b> <b>offered</b> by the retailer to its customers has a positive impact on demand of an item but the impact of credit period on demand has received a very little attention by the researchers. To incorporate this phenomenon, we assume that demand is linked to credit <b>period</b> <b>offered</b> by the retailer to the customers. This paper incorporates the concept of credit-linked demand and develops a new inventory model under two levels of trade credit policy to reflect the real-life situations. An easy-to-use algorithm is developed to determine the optimal credit as well as replenishment policy jointly for the retailer. Finally, numerical example is presented to illustrate the theoretical results followed by the sensitivity of various parameters on the optimal solution. ...|$|R

To increase over-subscription, firms should time their IPOs to coincide with periods of large positive initial returns and low volume of IPO activity.

Thus, it was observed that the most efficient treatment to reduce blueberry post-harvest loss was the combination of kefir grains in association with storage cooled at 5 ºC, not changing the chemical composition and nutritional of blueberry...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} first-trading day {{performance}} for {{a sample of}} 217 equity carve-out IPOs offered {{during the period of}} 1980 - 1998. Unlike IPOs examined in previous studies, where trading during the pre-IPO book-building period does not exist, and trading on the IPO date is rationed, investors can trade in the non-rationed market for shares in the parent, which holds a significant fraction of the subsidiary. We find an unconditional positive first-trading day return and that the returns to both the carved-out subsidiary and the parent on the IPO date are predicable conditional on the return to the parent during the book-building period. We provide evidence of cross-subsidization; specifically, initial returns to the subsidiary are related to price revisions to the subsidiary during the book-building period and in the market value of the remaining assets of the parent over the same period. Initial trading day returns to both the parent and the subsidiary are significantly related to market performance during the <b>offer</b> <b>period,</b> but the relation is negative. 1 1...|$|E
