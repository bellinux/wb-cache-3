The potential applications of furan-based {{building blocks for}} polymer applications has been extensively reviewed by Gandini. A notable example is Polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate, but also <b>other</b> <b>polyesters</b> and various polyamides and polyurethanes have been described in literature. Amongst others like Dupont and Corbion, the company [...] claims to have developed a cost effective route to produce FDCA and the derived polyesters via so-called YXY Building Blocks. [...] FDCA has also been applied in pharmacology. It was demonstrated that its diethyl ester had a strong anaesthetic action similar to cocaine. Dicalcium 2,5-furandicarboxylate was shown to inhibit the growth of Baccillus megatorium. Screening studies on FDCA-derived anilides showed their important anti-bacterial action. The diacid itself is a strong complexing agent, chelating such ions as: Ca2+, Cu2+ and Pb2+; it is utilized in medicine to remove kidney stones. Interestingly, HMF is metabolized via FDCA in mammals including humans. A very diluted solution of FDCA in tetrahydrofuran is utilized for preparing artificial veins for transplantation. At {{the beginning of this}} chapter, it was mentioned that FDCA is a chemically stable compound. This property has been well benefited in industry – FDCA as most of polycarboxylic acids can be an ingredient of fire foams. Such foams help to extinguish fires in a short time caused by polar and non-polar solvents.|$|E

40|$|International audienceElectrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) is able {{to support}} the {{adhesion}} and growth of h-osteoblasts and to delay their degradation rate {{to a greater extent}} with respect to <b>other</b> <b>polyesters.</b> The drawbacks linked to its employment in regenerative medicine arise fromits hydrophobic nature and the lack of biochemical signals linked to it. This work reports on the attempt to add five different self-assembling (SA) peptides to PCL solutions before electrospinning. The hybrid scaffolds obtained had regular fibers (SEM analysis) whose diameters were {{similar to those of the}} extracellularmatrix, more stable hydrophilic (contact angle measurement) surfaces, and anamorphous phase constrained by peptides (DSC analysis). They appeared to have a notable capacity to promote the h-osteoblast adhesion and differentiation process by increasing the gene expression of alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, and osteopontin. Adding an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif to a self-assembling sequence was found to enhance cell adhesion, while the same motif condensed with a scrambled sequence did not, indicating that there is a cooperative effect between RGD and 3 D architecture created by the self-assembling peptides. The study demonstrates that self-assembling peptide scaffolds are still able to promote beneficial effects on h-osteoblasts even after they have been included in electrospun polycaprolactone.

Interchange of PPVL with the diacetates and the diol occured readily, {{in particular in}} the presence of a titanium catalyst. Melting PPVL with 10 mol-% of bisphenol-Adiacetate {{in the presence of}} 0, 5 wt. % tetrabutylorthotitanate resulted in an incorporation of 33 % of the diacetate in the polymer chains, whereas the logarithmic viscosity number decreased by 81 %. The ester interchange was suggested to proceed by an initial cleavage of ester bonds in the polymer chain of PPVL, resulting in the formation of shorter chains, followed by a reaction between the newly formed ester end-groups and initially present hydroxyl chain ends. The acidolysis of PPVL with the diacids proved to be less effective; in the case of the acidolysis of PPVL with 10 mol-% isophthalic acid, less than 1 % of the diacid was incorporated in the polymer chains and a decrease in the logarithmic viscosity number of only 22 % was found. Both the high stability of the ester bond in PPVL towards acids in general and the heterogeneity of these systems were supposed to cause the behaviour of PPVL with respect to acidolysis.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{biomaterial}} science experienced enormous expansion {{because of its}} peculiar connections with other scientific, medical, and engineering disciplines, including molecular and cell biology, human physiology, and materials science. The continuous flow of knowledge among these fields, and the constant demand for new supplies and solutions is driving biomaterial science {{to be one of}} the most promising and intriguing scientific fields. In particular, two major applications of biomaterial science, that is tissue engineering and controlled drug delivery, attracted attention and dedication from many branches of academic and industrial entities. Tissue engineering is aimed at creating partial or complete bioartificial organs by exploiting the synergistic interactions of living cells and synthetic materials. Controlled drug delivery technology also represents one of the most rapidly advancing areas of biomaterial science. With respect to conventional dosage forms, delivery systems offer several advantages, including improved efficacy, reduced toxicity, better patient compliance, and convenience. Recently, the combination of drug delivery and tissue engineering techniques has been proposed, to afford systems that not only constitute a supportive scaffold for cell proliferation, but also guide cell development and organization by progressive and controlled release of cell growth and differentiating factors. Aliphatic polyesters are generally considered to be well–suited for applications as polymer–based biomaterials due to their demonstrated biocompatibility and biodegradability, because of the wide range of properties that can be attained by careful modulation of their chemical structure. The present work was aimed at the development of bioactive polymeric materials to be used for the targeted delivery of proteic drug and for applications in the tissue engineering field. The proposed strategy was based on the design of special polymer classes whose structures and functionality could be easily modified by finely tuning the adopted synthetic procedures. Polymalolactonate and <b>other</b> <b>polyesters</b> containing side chain primary hydroxyl groups were chosen as promising materials for the proposed applications. Initially, polyesters containing pendant primary hydroxyl groups were synthesized by polyaddition of oxetanes and carboxylic anhydrides catalyzed by quaternary onium halides. The polyaddition of bis(oxetane) with different dicarboxylic acids in the presence of the same catalysts was also investigated. In all cases, the oxetane monomers contained one hydroxyl functionality either free or protected by a benzyl group. The yield and the molecular weight of soluble polymer are good when aromatic anhydrides were used. In all other cases low conversions or no polymerization at all were obtained. On the other hand, readily available alcoholic derivatives were successfully employed to synthesize a series of á,á’,â–trisubstituted â–lactone monomers displaying a wide range of physical–chemical derivatives. The preparations were carried out according to established synthetic routes, in five steps starting from diethyl oxalpropionate. Final yields were related to the preparation method as well as to the nature of the monomer side chain, and were comprised in the 53 – 63 % range as based on the precursor alcohol. The purity of all synthesized monomers and intermediates were assessed by chromatographic techniques whereas their structural features were confirmed by FT–IR and 1 H–NMR spectroscopy. In the presence of catalytic amounts of quaternary ammonium salts, the synthesized functional lactones underwent anionic ring opening polymerization leading to the corresponding homopolymers and copolymers in fairly good yields. The prepared polymeric materials were extensively characterized by spectroscopic techniques, gel permeation chromatography, and thermal analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis evidenced materials stability up to 190 – 240 °C, the actual values being fairly dependent on the nature of pendant groups in the polymers. Preliminary biological tests performed on thin polymer films indicated that the polymer surface did not promote cell adhesion, although no significant toxic effect was detected. These data suggest that the synthesized, poly(alkyl malolactonate) s are better suited for drug delivery than for tissue engineering applications...|$|E

The conventional method for administering ganciclovir in cytomegalovirus retinitis patients is repeated intravitreal injections. In order to obviate the possible detrimental effects of repeated intraocular injections, to improve compliance and to eliminate systemic side-effects, we investigated the tuning of the ganciclovir pro-drug valganciclovir and the release from thin films of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polycaprolactone (PCL), or mixtures of both, as a step towards prototyping periocular valganciclovir implants. To investigate the drug release, we established and evaluated a high throughput fluorescence-based quantification screening assay for the detection of valganciclovir.
