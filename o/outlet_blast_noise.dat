This negatively impacts the military's testing & training capabilities due to restrictions, curfews, or range closures enacted to address noise complaints. In order to more directly manage noise around military installations, accurate noise monitoring has become a necessity. Although most noise monitors are simple sound level meters, more recent ones are capable of discerning <b>blasts</b> from ambient <b>noise</b> with some success.

Recent work will be presented from the development of a more advanced classifier that identifies additional classes of noise such as machine gun fire, vehicles, and thunder. Additional signal metrics were explored given the increased complexity of the classifier.

40|$|Several trench {{structures}} in corrugated ground are investigated {{for the possibility}} of mitigating gun <b>blast</b> <b>noise</b> by numerical simulations. The <b>blast</b> <b>noise</b> usually includes large explosive energy with nonlinearity in the near field and exhibits a very low-frequency spectrum. In this study, the linearity approximation for the noise is taken because the nonlinearity of the wave reaching the scatterer is not serious for many proved guns and the low-frequency characteristic is concentrated. The structures are designed based on the surface impedance design approach proposed in our previous work and arbitrary three-dimensional (3 D) geometries within a truncated ground are now assumed. The acoustic characteristic of the structures is evaluated by using a fast numerical solver. The solver employs the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) as an accelerator and can solve very large acoustic wave scattering problems with millions of unknowns on workstations within several days. This tool allows us to truncate the ground as large as needed for accurate modeling. Four structures are mainly considered in the design, namely, concentric trenches, sectorial trapezoidal trenches, interlaced arc trenches and parabolic reflectors. Some of them may have a sloped inner wall or tilted surface as a means of adjustment. Numerical simulations show that the concentric trench design has a very good mitigation behavior for linear and continuous noise sources and the structure is further studied for mitigating real-world gun <b>blast</b> <b>noise.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The surface {{impedance}} design approach is proposed for mitigating large-calibre gun <b>blast</b> <b>noise.</b> Surrounding the <b>blast</b> <b>noise,</b> we employ {{a group of}} concentric trenches with critical depths to dampen the propagation of the acoustic wave. These trenches behave like quarter-wavelength resonators and produce acoustic soft surfaces at their openings. The sound pressure is then mitigated over these soft surfaces by destructive interference and the wave attenuates rapidly along the ground surface. To evaluate the overall acoustic performance of such a design, we develop an efficient numerical solver by treating the geometry as a body of revolution (BOR). The symmetry of the structure in the revolution direction allows the 3 D boundary integral equation (BIE) for acoustic wave scattering to {{be reduced to a}} 2 D integral equation by the use of Fourier series expansions. Numerical experiments show that this model can effectively suppress the acoustic wave propagation horizontally and the reduction can reach about 15 dB for large-calibre gun noise with very low-frequency components. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the current}} study was to compare the quality of esophageal speech and voice to videofluoroscopic {{features}} of the esophagus and pharyngoesophageal (PE) segment. The speech and voice characteristics of 30 laryngectomized patients were rated by 5 speech-language pathologists. Based on these ratings, patients were divided into 3 categories: fluent (n = 9), moderately fluent (n = 10) and nonfluent (n = 11). Videofluoroscopy of the PE region was then performed during both swallowing and voice production. An insufflation test and percutaneous pharyngeal plexus block were required in 9 patients to determine the etiology of poor esophageal voice production. The strongest videofluoroscopic indicators of nonfluent speakers were: (1) small or absent air reservoir and (2) lack of a vibrating PE segment. Fluent speakers presented with shorter PE segments (1. 17 mm) compared to moderately fluent speakers (17. 1 - 29. 9 mm). Perceptually, fluent speakers presented with a predominantly rough vocal quality. In contrast, moderately fluent speakers presented with a tense quality.

40|$|The {{multilevel}} fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) {{is extended}} to solve for acoustic wave scattering by very large objects with three-dimensional arbitrary shapes. Although the fast multipole method as {{the prototype of}} MLFMA was introduced to acoustics early, {{it has not been}} used to study acoustic problems with millions of unknowns. In this work, the MLFMA is applied to analyze the acoustic behavior for very large truncated ground with many trenches in order to investigate the approach for mitigating gun <b>blast</b> <b>noise</b> at proving grounds. The implementation of the MLFMA is based on the Nyström method to create matrix equations for the acoustic boundary integral equation. As the Nyström method has a simpler mechanism in the generation of far-interaction terms, which MLFMA acts on, the resulting scheme is more efficient than those based on the method of moments and the boundary element method (BEM). For near-interaction terms, the singular or near-singular integrals are evaluated using a robust technique, which differs from that in BEM. Due to the enhanced efficiency, the MLFMA can rapidly solve acoustic wave scattering problems with more than two million unknowns on workstations without involving parallel algorithms. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the performance of the MLFMA with report of consumed CPU time and memory usage. © 2008 Acoustical Society of America. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Therefore the HATS already used by manufacturers to show compliance of their product with BS EN 271 : 1995 could also be used to provide information on the helmet’s noise attenuation.
