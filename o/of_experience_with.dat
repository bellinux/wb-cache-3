5|$|In {{the matter}} of Alvarado's age, Breyer {{found that it was}} {{relevant}} to the custody analysis. Further, Breyer held that nothing in the law prevents a judge from including age in the custody analysis. Breyer called the discussion <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> law enforcement misleading; while experience with law enforcement can be difficult to determine, Breyer noted that Alvarado's age was a known objective fact.|$|E
5|$|Laid down {{nearly four}} years after Vittorio Veneto and Littorio, Roma was able to {{incorporate}} a few design improvements. Her bow was noticeably redesigned to give Roma additional freeboard; partway into construction, it was modified on the basis <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> Vittorio Veneto so that it had had a finer end at the waterline. She was also equipped with thirty-two rather than twenty-four /65 caliber Breda guns.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with PBS in 2006, (after sixteen years <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> Grameen Bank as a social business) Yunus expressed satisfaction in the micro-credit system of Grameen bank as a motivation and {{an opportunity for the}} poor to improve their own situations. He stressed that he has observed that Grameen's borrowers attain a sense of confidence and self-sufficiency when they pay back their loans from Grameen bank. While being careful not to criticise charity's rightful place, he added that the recipient of a charitable gift does not experience these long-term emotional benefits in the same way.|$|E

5|$|There was one {{change of}} driver before the race. Jon Wood, the {{grandson}} of retired driver Glen Wood, was originally scheduled to replace 1988 NASCAR Winston Cup Series champion Bill Elliott in the No. 21 Wood Brothers Racing car, but withdrew {{because of a lack}} <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> the Car of Tomorrow, and former Haas CNC Racing driver Johnny Sauter took over his seat. Wood said he felt Sauter was a better qualifier and Elliott was not available to drive. Kahne developed a sinus infection two days before the event, and his team had Nationwide Series driver Jason Keller ready to replace him if he could not compete.|$|E
5|$|The first {{title to}} be {{conceived}} was Advent Children, original envisioned as a short film presentation created by Visual Works, the animation studio behind CGI cutscenes for the company's games. Early in pre-production, {{plans to make}} Advent Children a video game rather than a film were considered, but due to several factors including Visual Works' lack <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> actual game production, it remained a film. One of the main conditions for the project's launch was to reunite the original staff members of Final Fantasy VII: Nojima, art director Yusuke Naora, composer Nobuo Uematsu. After Advent Children began development, it was decided by the team that one title {{was not enough to}} fully explore the VII universe. In response, Before Crisis, Dirge of Cerberus and Crisis Core were conceived so as to embrace more aspects of the world and characters. Nomura himself was surprised at the creation of the games, having originally assumed that the film would be the sole product of the project.|$|E

50|$|After {{publishing}} {{an influential}} {{book on the}} subject, Goodman began to create a psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic model of reading inspired {{by the work of}} Noam Chomsky. Goodman decided that the process of reading was similar to the process of learning a language as conceptualized by Chomsky, and that literacy developed naturally as a consequence <b>of</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>with</b> print, just as language ability developed naturally as a consequence <b>of</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>with</b> language. Goodman concluded that attempts to teach rules ("phonics") to children for decoding words were inappropriate and not likely to succeed.|$|R
25|$|Spore is a {{game that}} is {{separated}} into stages, each stage presenting a different type <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> different goals to achieve.

25|$|England's bowlers made {{light of}} the West Indies vaunted batting line-up, with Fraser {{especially}} bringing some steel and determination to the attack.

Chanderpaul again defied his lack <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> a four-hour 77, and he received sterling support from Ambrose (44) and Kenny Benjamin (43*) that dragged the total above 300.|$|E
25|$|Drug {{rehabilitation}} (often drug rehab or just rehab) is {{the processes}} of medical or psychotherapeutic treatment for dependency on psychoactive substances such as alcohol, prescription drugs, and street drugs such as cocaine, heroin or amphetamines. The general intent is to enable the patient to confront substance dependence, if present, and cease substance abuse to avoid the psychological, legal, financial, social, and physical consequences that can be caused, especially by extreme abuse. Treatment includes medication for depression or other disorders, counseling by experts and sharing <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> other addicts.|$|E

25|$|Another {{school that}} began after the Revolution {{is now known}} as Constructivism. Some of the Constructivists (like the Vesnin brothers) were young {{professionals}} who had established themselves before 1917, while others had just completed their professional education (like Konstantin Melnikov) or didn't have any. They associated themselves with groups of modern artists, compensating for lack <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> public exposure. When the New Economic Policy began, their publicity resulted in architectural commissions. Experience was not gained quickly, and many constructivist buildings were justly criticized for irrational floorplans, cost overruns and low quality.|$|E
25|$|The Classis Germanica was {{established}} in 12 BC by Drusus at Castra Vetera. It controlled the Rhine river, and was mainly a fluvial fleet, although it also operated in the North Sea. It is noteworthy that the Romans' initial lack <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> the tides of the ocean left Drusus' fleet stranded on the Zuiderzee. After ca. 30 AD, the fleet moved its main base to the castrum of Alteburg, some 4km south of Colonia Agrippinensis (modern Cologne). Later granted the honorifics Augusta Pia Fidelis Domitiana following {{the suppression of the}} Revolt of Saturninus.|$|E
25|$|The first Berkeley was {{accepted}} for trials at RAF Martlesham Heath in May 1925 and remained there until November. Other aircraft competing for production contracts were the Handley Page Handcross, the Hawker Horsley and the Westland Yeovil. The Handcross and the Berkeley {{were the two}} larger machines {{and for that reason}} judged more suitable for the night bombing role; unfortunately for Handley-Page and Bristol, the Air Ministry had already decided, on the basis <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> the Avro Aldershot that single-engine aircraft were not suitable for night-bombing. In the end, therefore the only successful contender was the Horsley, chosen for the day-bomber role.|$|E

25|$|Cognitive systems {{engineering}} (CSE) {{is a specific}} approach to the description and analysis of human-machine systems or sociotechnical systems. The three main themes of CSE are how humans cope with complexity, how work is accomplished {{by the use of}} artifacts, and how human-machine systems and socio-technical systems can be described as joint cognitive systems. CSE has since its beginning become a recognized scientific discipline, sometimes also referred to as cognitive engineering. The concept of a Joint Cognitive System (JCS) has in particular become widely used as a way of understanding how complex socio-technical systems can be described with varying degrees of resolution. The more than 20 years <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> CSE has been described extensively.|$|E
25|$|Flight-ready Dragonfly engines were {{delivered}} during 1919. As they were heavier than expected, the design {{had to be}} modified with the engines mounted further back and the stagger on the wings adjusted. The Dragonfly powered aircraft were also fitted with a larger rudder as a result <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> the Puma powered aircraft. The two Dragonfly powered prototypes, designated Cobham Mk I (with the Puma-powered first prototype designated Cobham Mk II), flew in January and February 1920. The Dragonfly proved to be extremely unreliable, {{and development of the}} engine was stopped in September 1920, leading to the two Dragonfly powered prototypes being discarded. The first prototype did not last much longer, being last flown on 27 January 1921 at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough.|$|E
25|$|One {{hundred and}} five {{aircraft}} were in {{service at the}} start of World War II, more than enough to equip the major surface units of the Italian Navy, but soon a better aircraft was requested, possibly a navalized fighter. This resulted in a small series being built of a naval version of the Reggiane Re.2000 that could be catapulted but was not fitted with floats so had to either return to a land base or ditch, in a similar fashion to the Hawker Hurricanes operated by British CAM ships. The best feature were the folding wings, but even so the maximum carried on board was usually two. This, together with the modest possibilities of recovery and the lack <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> naval aviation (even though the Italian Navy possessed a seaplane carrier, the Giuseppe Miraglia) limited the use of the aircraft in combat.|$|E
