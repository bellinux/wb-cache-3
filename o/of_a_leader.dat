5|$|Formerly an {{administrative}} district {{in its own}} right, even a regional capital, Carabane is now just one of 23villages in the rural community of Diembéring, of which Kabrousse, Cap Skirring, and Boucott-Diembéring are the largest centres. This rural community {{is located in the}} Kabrousse Arrondissement. It is part of Oussouye Department, the smallest and least central of the three departments in Ziguinchor Region. In a country which includes some 13,000 villages, the village is considered, by a 1972 decree, the elementary entity in the administrative body of the nation. Each is administered by a leader, assisted by a council. After consultation, the nomination <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> is established by the prefect and approved by the Minister of the Interior. Under Senegalese law, the leader of the village has certain prerogatives, including law enforcement, tax collection, and keeping of vital records in the village.|$|E

On 19 December 1979 he was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. In detention, he distanced himself from the RAF. In February 1987 the rest of his punishment to the probation was suspended because he was seriously ill.|$|E
40|$|Status {{within a}} group {{can be quickly}} achieved. Research has shown, for instance, that {{individual}} traits such as race, gender, or expertise influence individuals’ status and their team’s early interactions. The current research digs into the micro-behaviors of these early interactions by investigating the potent impact <b>of</b> <b>a</b> team <b>leader’s</b> nonverbal behavior (e. g., unequal visual attention) on the status hierarchy within small groups. In Study 1, individuals who received more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> visual attention {{were more likely to}} influence group decisions than individuals who received less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> visual attention, and groups that received this unequal visual attention performed worse than groups that received equal attention. Study 2 investigated whether the effects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> visual attention were due simply to the attention itself or whether it depended on the leader’s status. The results supported the latter hypothesis, as attention transferred status: more attention from <b>a</b> high-status <b>leader</b> increased <b>a</b> person’s status but more attention from <b>a</b> low-status <b>leader</b> decreased it. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|The ties {{of loyalty}} to a lord, were to the person of a lord, not to his station; {{there was no real}} concept of patriotism or loyalty to a cause. This {{explains}} why dynasties waxed and waned so quickly, a kingdom was only as strong as its leader-king. There was no underlying administration or bureaucracy to maintain any gains beyond the lifetime <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader.</b> An example of this was the leadership of Rædwald of East Anglia and how the East Anglian primacy did not survive his death. Kings could not, except in exceptional circumstances, make new laws. Their role instead was to uphold and clarify previous custom and to assure his subjects that he would uphold their ancient privileges, laws, and customs. Although the person of the king as a leader could be exalted, the office of kingship was not in any sense as powerful or as invested with authority as it was to become. One of the tools kings used was to tie themselves closely to the new Christian church; through the practice of having a church leader anoint and crown the king; God and king were joined in peoples' minds.|$|E
25|$|Each {{unit that}} can be {{included}} in a union is composed <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader,</b> the head, and as many as seven underlings, or 'members'. For example, in the case of Yggdra's unit, Yggdra is the head, and her five members are Sword Maidens. Each unit has a weapon type, with strengths and weaknesses in a rock-paper-scissors fashion. Each unit comes with six stats: Morale, an indicator with a function similar to Hit points; GEN, generalcy; ATK, attack; TEC, technique; and LUK, luck. The final stat depends on alignment of the unit. Player units have REP, reputation, measuring victory rates, and enemy units have POW.UP, which is a reducible stat that increases card POW upon player victory. Each unit also has the potential for five 'effects', which are strategy altering hooks that do many things, from the in-clash voiding of damage enhanced with a particular element, to out of clash Morale restoration. Up to four effects can be innate to the unit, with one effect coming from the unit's equipped item. Items are multi-purpose in Yggdra Union; they can be equipped for stat ups and effects, or they can be consumed to recover Morale. Equipped items cannot be removed, and will disappear after a set amount of battlefields.|$|E

40|$|Political {{conflict}} across Africa {{is often}} {{linked to the}} pervasive use of patron-age in retaining control of the state. However, few sources of data have been available to systematically {{examine the relationship between}} <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> patronage strategies and the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extraconstitutional change in power. This article employs ministerial appointments to the cabinet as a proxy for changes in the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> patronage coalition. With time-series cross-section data on 40 African countries, this study shows that the size of cabinets varies systematically according to regime type, resource constraints, ethnic fractionalization, and total population. It then shows that African leaders extend their tenure in office by expanding their patronage coalition through cabinet appointments. A proportional hazards model of regime duration indicates that cabinet expansion lowers the probability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> being deposed through a coup. The appointment of one additional minister to the cabinet lowers <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> coup risk by a greater extent than does a 1 -percentage-point increase in economic growth...|$|R

Anime News Network also commented on this development, calling Shikamaru's emergence as [...] "an unlikely hero" [...] {{one of the highlights of}} the arc. In a subsequent review of episode 135, in which the mission to retrieve Sasuke has failed and the members of Shikamaru's team were critically injured, IGN lauded the [...] "great moment" [...] in the episode in which Shikamaru began to cry after learning his friends will recover, and declared that he will be a better leader for the sake of his friends. Mania Entertainment's Justin Rich celebrated his [...] "sheer intellect", calling him [...] "one of the most fascinating characters in the series" [...] and [...] "one of the few truly brilliant fighters in shōnen anime".

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} how individuals form perceptions of authenticity about their leaders and the subsequent organizational outcomes associated with these perceptions. To date, studies on leader authenticity have primarily focused on how <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> can become more authentic by first getting in touch with his or her internal values and then by choosing behaviors to enact these values. As such, the literature has clarified <b>leader</b> authenticity on <b>an</b> individual level, but does not explain how others come to perceive <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> as authentic. To this end, an experiment will be completed to investigate leader authenticity from the point-of-view of the “recipients” <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> behavior. In particular, the focus will be on individuals’ perceptions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader’s</b> enactment <b>of</b> procedural fairness by inviting voice during a promotion decision. <b>A</b> new model <b>of</b> perceived authenticity will be tested by determining how two types of interpersonal perceptions—volitionality and intentionality—influence perceptions of authenticity and related outcomes...|$|R
