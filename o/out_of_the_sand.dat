5|$|The {{waters in}} which Kimberella dwelt were {{occasionally}} disturbed by sandy currents, caused when sediments were whipped up by storms or meltwater discharge, and washed over the creatures. In {{response to this}} stress, the organisms appear to have retracted their soft parts into their shells; apparently they could not move fast enough to outrun the currents. Some organisms survived the current, and attempted to burrow <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> that had been deposited above them; some unsuccessful attempts can be seen where juveniles were fossilised {{at the end of}} a burrow a few centimetres long.|$|E
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass have an {{important}} function in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and grey hair-grass help to bind the sand. Sea holly, sand sedge, bird's-foot trefoil and pyramidal orchid are other specialists of this arid habitat. Some specialised mosses and lichens are found on the dunes, and help to consolidate the sand; a survey in September 2009 found 41 lichen species. The plant distribution {{is influenced by the}} dunes' age as well as their moisture content, the deposits becoming less alkaline as calcium carbonate from animal shells is leached <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> to be replaced by more acidic humus from plant decomposition products. Marram grass is particularly discouraged by the change in acidity. A similar pattern is seen with mosses and lichens, with the various areas of the dunes containing different species according to the acidity of the sand. At least four moss species have been identified as important in dune stabilization, since they help to consolidate the sand, add nutrients as they decompose, and pave the way for more exacting plant species. The moss and lichen flora of Blakeney Point differs markedly from that of lime-rich dunes on the western coasts of the UK. Non-native tree lupins have become established near the Lifeboat House, where they now grow wild.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the video, soil crumbles down, as Björk appears, buried to her waist in the sand, wearing a golden dress (by Michael van der Ham), a brooch on her shoulder designed by the singer herself and a blue wig, holding a rock. As she starts singing, she divides the rock into two pieces. As she waves the pieces, the sand around her stirs. She then lays the two pieces on the sand, and they become part of two rock sprites, that come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> and start writhing around Björk, while strata emerges from them. In {{the end of the first}} verse, the strata of the two rocky sprites try to unite, as Björk grabs the sand and let it slips out from her fingers. During the second verse other rocks emerge from the sand and revolve around Björk, who dances in the sand. Other rocky sprites spring out of the new rocks and link to the main two, which are still spinning around the singer's head. The two parts are irresistibly attracted to each other and try to unite as they are stroked by Björk. The strata of the rocks morph to form a face, similar to that of the singer. As the chorus begins, Björk disappears in the darkness. The two rocky parts, now united, start to bestir themselves, whilst various rocks on the sand start to erupt. Lava, magma, smoke and fire storm while Björk's face appears in the lava. Every rock erupts noisily, causing a rain of volcanic ash.|$|E

The nanobots follow Kryten's orders but, perhaps feeling guilty for the all the trouble they've caused, they seemingly overcompensate by giving Lister an upgrade - giving him <b>the</b> body <b>of</b> a muscular bodybuilder. Also, as Starbug flies into the reconstructed Red Dwarf landing bay, something feels odd: it seems awfully, awfully big. In the last shot Starbug flies in like a buzzing fly against a massively enlarged ship.|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the most}} unusual parts of the cave is the Sand Garden, located about 3,000 feet (914m) from the entrance. [...] Here the floor of the cave is covered with sand. [...] The sand was carried into the cave by {{dripping}} water. [...] The sand is fine volcanic ash from the eruption of Mount Mazama 6,600 years ago. [...] Rain and melting snow carried the ash down from the surface through cracks in the rock and deposited it {{on the floor of the}} cave one grain at a time. [...] Occasionally, enough water leaks into the cave to create a pool. [...] This allows the sand to spread out across the floor. [...] At the Sand Garden, the constant dripping of water has carved spires and pinnacles in the sand. [...] Since it takes hundreds of years to build these delicate sand forms, the Forest Service has fenced off the garden area to protect it. [...] The 2,211 feet (674m) of cave trail beyond the Sand Garden has a sandy floor. [...] Along the way, the ceiling descends lower and lower until the sand fills the cave. [...] The last 310 feet (95m) of the cave was dug <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> plug by two men in the 1930s. [...] Exploring this section of the cave requires visitors to crawl on hands and knees for much of the distance to the cave’s end, and usually takes at least thirty minutes.|$|E

50|$|In 1990 David Vostell {{directed}} the feature film The Being from Earth in Los Angeles. This feature, with German title Das Wesen der Erde, tells <b>the</b> fantastic story <b>of</b> a being / creature, a mixture between animal and plant, born <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mojave desert. The film title alludes mainly to this being born from earth, {{but it can}} also be seen as a metaphor. In its metaphorical sense, it could refer to <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet Earth, to its being or to existence itself. Long camera takes, scenes which are designed to show the acting pared down to the essential, dialogues only as necessary and lots of music show his individual directing style, but often leave the cinema audience puzzled. The Being from Earth differs strongly from <b>the</b> conventional view <b>of</b> cinema.|$|R
60|$|It {{would be}} {{tiresome}} {{to the reader}} to particularise my account with <b>the</b> relation <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> fine things our host had in his house, and I could not be persuaded {{but that he had}} borrowed all the plate in the town to furnish out his sideboard and table. But my doctor told me it was nothing but what was very usual among them that were men of any substance, as it was apparent he was; and that the silversmiths at St. Jago supplied them generally with their plate ready wrought, in exchange (with allowance for the quality) for the gold which they found in the mountains, or in the brooks and streams which came from the mountains, into which <b>the</b> hasty showers <b>of</b> winter rain frequently washed down pretty large lumps, and others, which were smaller, they washed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sands</b> by <b>the</b> ordinary methods <b>of</b> washing of ore.|$|R
5000|$|The Lost City (B4) is a Dungeons & Dragons {{adventure}} module by Tom Moldvay.

60|$|This boiling spring, as {{they called}} it, was a {{beautiful}} spring, from which fine cool water was always boiling up <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand.</b> It was in a narrow glen, shaded by trees, and the water running down into a little sort of meadow, kept the grass green there, even in very dry times; so that the cows were very fond of this spot.|$|E
50|$|This species {{feeds on}} chironomid larvae, copepods, nematodes, {{and other small}} animals. It is also herbivorous.

60|$|Kit had {{not seen}} a Berber laugh, but when Simon {{translated}} {{it looked as if}} the headman smiled.

All the same, he doubted if the headman knew there was a cartridge in the magazine. Macallister, stopping by the other, opened the pistol.|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} day and a quarter our men all {{together}} had gathered a pound and two ounces of gold or thereabouts, and as we found the quantity increased the farther we went, we followed it about three days, till another small rivulet joined the first, and then searching up the stream, we found gold there too; so we pitched our camp in the angle where the rivers joined, and we diverted ourselves, as I may call it, in washing the gold <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> of the river, and in getting provisions.|$|E
