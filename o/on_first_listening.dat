5000|$|For many NBS fans {{this album}} {{may seem to}} sound very strange <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>listen.</b> The music can be {{considered}} to be a mash of Kosmikud's and No-Big-Silence's music.

5000|$|.....<b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>listen</b> (and in general) I {{found the}} second half 'easier on the ear'. At least at that time, in February 1997, I found the first half very bitter and more {{suitable}} as a climax following on from part 2. By doing this I caused confusion (not bad in itself) and misinterpretation (e.g., the N.O.T.E.S. fanzine called disc 2 an encore) which I had not foreseen. Today I would have explained the swap in the CD booklet.|$|R
2500|$|As a teaser, Yamin {{released}} the song [...] "Movin' On" [...] from his self-titled debut album <b>on</b> AOL's <b>First</b> <b>Listen</b> and iTunes in February 2007. His first radio single, [...] "Wait For You", {{was released on}} March 13, 2007.|$|R
50|$|On December 4, 2013 {{the band}} {{announced}} the upcoming release of its third studio album, Lost in the Dream (March 18, 2014). The band streamed the album {{in its entirety}} <b>on</b> NPR's <b>First</b> <b>Listen</b> site for a week before its release.|$|R
500|$|... "Run the World (Girls)" [...] is {{a complex}} but catchy track that's {{actually}} more reminiscent of M.I.A. and Santigold than Sasha Fierce. The song combines a dancefloor-defying military drumbeat, a sample from Switch's group Major Lazer, an unconventional song structure and some incongruously pretty, layered melodics that are basically chanted but still employ [...] full vocal range. The lyrics, however, are just as female-empowering as we've come to expect. There's much more to the song than first meets the ear—it confuses <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>listen</b> but coalesces beautifully with repeated plays.|$|R
50|$|The song debuted <b>on</b> AOL Music: <b>First</b> <b>Listen</b> <b>on</b> December 22, 2006. The {{song was}} {{featured}} on the album, Radio Disney Jams, Vol. 10.|$|R
50|$|Years in {{development}} and previewed <b>first</b> <b>on</b> NPR’s <b>First</b> <b>Listen,</b> Midnight Sun {{was released on}} April 29, 2014 on Chimera Music and received strong critical response. A departure from their previous more acoustic efforts, critics were almost universally positive about the album, with Metacritic giving it a composite 82 rating.|$|R
5000|$|Recipe for Hate {{received}} generally mixed {{to positive}} reviews from most music critics. Allmusic reviewer Jack Rabid gave the album {{a rating of}} three-and-a-half stars out of five and states: [...] "It's easy to take them for granted, to view Recipe as just another red-hot LP (ho hum) by the last and best band to survive the '80s L.A. punk explosion. And <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>listen,</b> it's tarnished by their previous mild malaise: everything sounds alike, and some exit the boat here too quickly. But then the beautiful sonic smack starts to sink in, and the luxurious melodies introduce erudite parables." ...|$|R
50|$|The single was {{released}} {{ahead of the}} album, initially appearing <b>on</b> AOL <b>First</b> <b>Listen</b> <b>on</b> March 28, 2005, then as a digital single on iTunes on March 29, then on radio as of April 4 and finally from other digital music providers as of April 5.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Alex Henderson awarded the album 4 stars stating [...] "Topaz, {{like a lot}} of avant-garde jazz, isn't easy to absorb <b>on</b> the <b>first</b> <b>listen.</b> But the more times you listen, the more you realize how much this left-of-center CD has going for it".|$|R
5000|$|The BBC gave [...] "Outta Here" [...] 3 out of 5 stars, {{calling it}} 'fun' and 'good'. Music Focus Release said that [...] ""Outta Here" [...] isn’t {{a song that}} {{immediately}} grabs you. In fact <b>on</b> the <b>first</b> <b>listen</b> we found ourselves a little disappointed and indifferent." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{song was}} picked up quickly {{by a couple of}} {{alternative}} rock stations {{in the first week of}} availability. San Diego's 91x spun the song for the very <b>first</b> time <b>on</b> July 20, with Los Angeles' KROQ featuring the single <b>on</b> their <b>First</b> <b>Listen</b> blog a couple of days later.|$|R
5000|$|... "No Bleeding Hearts" [...] {{features}} Harley's son, Kerr Nice, playing piano. The {{idea was}} {{suggested by the}} band's keyboardist James Lascelles, after Nice arrived for an overnight stay at the studio. The song was described by Harley in October 2009: [...] "The song may seem mysterious <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>listen,</b> but I'm quietly hoping {{that those who have}} now heard it twice, some even three times on this tour, will have started to form some interpretation." [...] In the May 2010 issue of Acoustic Magazine, Harley stated that the song sounded like the early Cockney Rebel, and [...] "could be very much my modern day Sebastian".|$|R
5000|$|PopMatters {{observed}} [...] "if Threads won’t immediately make Ware as {{well known}} as a composer as he is as a player, it definitely serves as a loud call that his skills don’t end with his saxophone". The All About Jazz review said [...] "While some may question this seemingly off-kilter group of selections, it seems that Ware is once again searching for some new musical plane that may be unknown but definitely makes the journey interesting". JazzTimes noted [...] "It's hard {{not to think of}} Ware as a guest star on Threads, at least <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>listen.</b> However the music's power ends up taking over, making the album likely {{to become one of the}} most significant offerings in the saxophonist's career".|$|R
5000|$|Songs on {{the album}} have been cited by musicians as influences. Dean Spunt of the American noise rock duo No Age said in 2011 that [...] "D.I. Go Pop" [...] is a song he [...] "can listen to 50 {{times in a row}} and not get sick of. There is so much to {{decipher}} and read into. An amazing piece of music." [...] Double Denim Records owner and Pitchfork Media writer Hari Ashurt said [...] "D.I. Go Pop" [...] has [...] "that effect where <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>listen</b> it races ahead of you before you can arrange it into something that makes sense," [...] noting [...] "I had the same feeling listening to Loveless for the <b>first</b> time-- <b>listening</b> to it loudly almost triggers motion sickness." [...] Contact Music described [...] "D. I. Go Pop" [...] as being [...] "made like mutated strains of C86 that, instead of bursting out into a controlled mushroom cloud, reached critical mass and became black-holes, devouring anything nearby." ...|$|R
500|$|The group {{recorded}} [...] "Wings" [...] at TMS' {{studio in}} London, The Music Shed. It was mixed by Serban Ghenea and John Hanes, with assistance from Phil Seaford at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Little Mix knew <b>on</b> their <b>first</b> <b>listen</b> {{that it had}} to be DNAs lead single. In April 2012, they played it to Cowell who according to the group tapped his foot to the song and called it [...] "genius".|$|R
5000|$|You & Me {{garnered}} broadly positive {{critical acclaim}} from reviewers. Turntable Kitchen {{described it as}} [...] "a thoughtful album that bears witness to a band that is comfortable in their own skin having learned the value of subtlety." [...] Spin gave the album four stars out of five, calling it [...] "a bittersweet, but emboldened fairy tale of New York City rock." [...] The Guardian awarded the album five out of five stars, describing it as [...] "intimate, intense and beautiful... You & Me demands repeat plays and The Walkmen deserve a new respect." [...] Drowned in Sound gave the album 8 out of 10, saying [...] "It's not a showy record, but one that when peeled apart reveals itself to be a darker and more engaging album than <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>listen.</b> But not only that, as {{it might also be}} the best thing they've ever done." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Chasing Lions" [...] {{received}} positive reviews, {{with the}} 405 calling the song [...] "sonically fearless". Vinyl Noise commented: [...] "'Chasing Lions' comes sun kissed {{in a new}} sound, more electronic than before, but not too over the top. They still fit the tribal-pop bill, but with synths and glitches sprinkled on top." [...] Furthemore, Popped Music said: [...] "Some songs just have impact <b>on</b> the <b>first</b> <b>listen</b> and Natives' <b>first</b> track in over a year, 'Chasing Lions,' has had just that." ...|$|R
500|$|Among mixed reviews, Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork criticized A Ghost Is Born as [...] "wildly uneven" [...] and [...] "less {{cohesive}} {{than any}} other Wilco release." [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau called it a [...] "privileged self-indulgence" [...] due to its extreme musical dynamics. NME wrote of the album: [...] "It's like Scissor Sisters on tranquilisers. With a bit of ELO. And a dash of Ramones. And, with this eclecticism, a worrying lack of focus." [...] Joshua Klein of the Chicago Tribune felt that the album possessed an [...] "incomplete" [...] quality which nonetheless can be [...] "quite intriguing, more of a side step than a forward leap, but a worthy experiment all the same." [...] Ann Powers of Blender wrote that <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>listen,</b> the album is [...] "rather monotonous, a bunch of moderately singable tunes with some noise piled up around the edges", but that it [...] "starts to insinuate meaning" [...] over subsequent listens.|$|R
5000|$|... "Ah, cheeky little scamps - MGMT {{save their}} most simplistic song for last, 'Congratulations' playing {{out like a}} sequel to the {{reckless}} decadence of 'Time to Pretend', the duo overlooking their success with a sneering, sarcastic eye. [...] "Out with a whimper/It's no blaze of glory" [...] sings Van Wyngarden over a folky, tender rhythm section. Ending with a round of (we imagine) piss-taking handclaps, it's a fitting close to an album that will test the patience of MGMT fans who were only into the 'HITS', but perhaps that's the point; in one big, imaginative sidestep, MGMT might have just leapt the hurdle of becoming a one-album wonder, carving out a career at the true heirs to Flaming Lips' throne in the process. It's not an album that will thrill <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>listen</b> - I listened about, umm, ten times before I wrote this, but it’s a record that deserves your attention nonetheless." ...|$|R
5000|$|Digital Spy {{gave the}} song 4 stars, stating [...] "Provocative, ostentatious, restless, fearless, shameless... {{are just a}} handful of {{adjectives}} we'd happily slap on the back of Lady GaGa's meat dress. Current X Factor champ Joe McElderry, on t'other hand, is just a lovely young man with a lovely face and a lovely voice. However, as his first non-Winner's Song single shows, sometimes that's enough. 'Ambitions' is actually a cover of a Scando chart-topper from little-known Norwegian band Donkeyboy, but Awur Joe, you'll be glad to know, Really Makes It... In fact, he impresses with a falsetto that has all of Mika's finesse but none of the flounce, the chorus hits the spot <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>listen</b> and the whole thing's got more bounce than a puppy with rubber booties on. A few more tunes like this, and the Geordie lad's going {{to make a lot of}} pop fans go a little bit... GaGa." ...|$|R
5000|$|Paige {{partnered with}} {{producer}} Jeremy Bose {{to begin work}} on her fourth studio album in early 2016. Funds for the album were raised through a Kickstarter campaign, where fans were able help cover album costs. [...] "My plan {{was to create a}} simple acoustic-type album," [...] Paige recalled. In regard to the change in sound she continued, [...] "Once a pop girl, always a pop girl. Give me those synths over a guitar any day." [...] Paige clarified that the song is not a break up song. [...] "This song speaks to the sometimes exhausting grind that troubles even the happiest of couples. Sometimes we just aren’t connecting, and it doesn’t have to be some over the top reason. It can be something so simple that begins to break us down. <b>On</b> <b>first</b> <b>listen,</b> this may seem like a break-up song, but it’s more a song about finding your way back when times get super tough.".|$|R
5000|$|I {{discovered}} Miles Davis {{at the age}} of nineteen, when a {{good friend}} of mine introduced me to his music. I thought it was futuristic <b>on</b> a <b>first</b> <b>listen</b> and didn’t really understand the essence of it. When moving to London and listening to it again, I managed to open my mind to those sounds and arrangements. Since then, my music has contained jazz elements. The first part of Th1rt3en is definitively exploring a more jazzy approach, while the second half gets a little more progressive.—Robert Miles, interview on tokafi.com ...|$|R
5000|$|The Agent Intellect is {{the third}} studio album by Detroit post-punk band Protomartyr, {{released}} on 9 October 2015. The first single from the album, [...] "Why Does It Shake" [...] was released on 14 July 2015, along with the formal announcement of the album's title, release date, cover art and track listing. On 25 August the band released the second single for the album, [...] "Dope Cloud". on 28 September the band released the third single for the album, [...] "I Forgive You".

5000|$|The {{release of}} their third album, El Desierto Y La Ciudad, was a sonic {{departure}} {{for the band}} that earned them praise {{from the likes of}} NPR, The Wall Street Journal, and The Village Voice. The album was featured <b>on</b> NPR's <b>First</b> <b>Listen</b> for which Felix Contreras wrote, “…inventive sense of arrangement, combined with great songwriting, elevates El Desierto y la Ciudad above and beyond its traditional source material. The result is a major step forward for a songwriter and a band that deserves wider recognition. With this album, Pistolera just might get it.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Heartbeat {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reception from music critics. The four star review by CCM Magazines Andrew Greer was {{given for the}} music coming [...] "With a burden for bearing life-changing spiritual truths through his rhyming prowess over thick jams, the gospel hip-hop forerunner enrolls a list of Grammy-winning producers to distribute a LP that is musically both experimental and highly accessible." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic rated the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, stating that [...] "its the usual T.R.U.T.H. boldness and brilliance all over again, along {{with the return of}} the overabundance issue, although even at 16 tracks, this one only seems overstuffed by about one or two". At New Release Tuesday, Dwayne Lacy rated the album three-and-a-half stars, writing that [...] "this album has so much to offer". Branden Murphy of Wade-O Radio stated that while the album allowed Da T.R.U.T.H.s creativity and freedom that comes with recording under his own, newly established label, the wide variety of styles on the album can come across as [...] "scattered" [...] <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>listen.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 18 February, RTCG {{announced}} that the Montenegrin entry would be composed by Serbian singer-songwriter Željko Joksimović. Joksimović had previously participated in the Eurovision Song Contest as a performer himself, performing [...] "Lane moje" [...] for Serbia and Montenegro in 2004 where he placed second and [...] "Nije ljubav stvar" [...] for Serbia in 2012 where he placed third. Joksimović had also composed entries for Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2006 and Serbia in 2008. On 11 March, {{the title of the}} song was revealed to be [...] "Adio" [...] with lyrics by Marina Tucaković and Dejan Ivanović. In response to preparations surrounding the song, Knez stated: [...] "I am very pleased with the composition which will represent our country and I can say that the reactions of those who had the opportunity to hear it are positive <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>listen,</b> as we inspire optimism that we will achieve a good result in Vienna." [...] On 17 March, [...] "Adio" [...] premiered online via the official Eurovision Song Contest website with the official video for the song being released shortly afterwards on 18 March.|$|R
