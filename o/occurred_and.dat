5|$|Tropical Storm Two {{was first}} {{observed}} 440mi (705km) southwest of Zihuatanejo on June16. While remaining far {{west of the}} Mexican coast, Two peaked as a 50mph (80km/h) tropical storm. No change in intensity <b>occurred,</b> <b>and</b> the tropical storm dissipated southwest of Baja California at 1200 UTC June23.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression was first observed 300mi (485km) southeast of Socorro Island on September29. The depression rapidly intensified, {{and was a}} Category1 hurricane only twelve hours after being first observed. Peaking as an 85mph (140km/h) Category1 hurricane, Hurricane Six tied Hurricane Four as the strongest tropical cyclone of the season. After reaching its peak intensity, Hurricane Six rapidly weakened, and passed 70mi (125km) southeast of Socorro Island with winds of 50mph (85km/h). Further weakening <b>occurred,</b> <b>and</b> the storm had dissipated on September 30.|$|E
5|$|About half-past {{one o'clock}} on the morning, an {{explosion}} {{took place in}} Felling colliery, by which nine men and thirteen boys were hurried into eternity, several others severely burnt, and all the underground horses but one destroyed. The accident occurred {{at the time of}} calling course, or when one set of men were relieving another. Several of the morning shift men were standing round the mouth of the pit, waiting to go down, when the blast <b>occurred,</b> <b>and</b> the part who had just descended met it soon after they had reached the bottom of the shaft; these were most miserably burnt and mangled.|$|E

5|$|After Victoria {{converted}} to alphanumeric route markers the Victorian section was signed as B23. In 2013 the NSW and ACT conversion to alphanumeric routes <b>occurred</b> <b>and</b> {{the remainder of}} the highway (south of Hindmarsh Drive in the ACT) was then also signed as B23. This violates the convention in New South Wales, where numbered routes below 50 are prefixed with an 'A' and 'B' routes are numbered above 50; the violation was allowed so the number and letter would be consistent across state lines.|$|E

5|$|At 5:32 pm CST (2332 UTC), a {{supercell}} thunderstorm {{produced a}} multiple-vortex tornado in Southaven, Mississippi. The tornado first struck Southaven High School, where 30 windows were broken, minor roof damage <b>occurred,</b> <b>and</b> damage was rated EF0. In the nearby Carriage Hill subdivision, several homes sustained minor damage as well. The tornado rapidly intensified to EF2 strength as it crossed {{the intersection of}} Stateline Road and Airways Boulevard, destroying three warehouse buildings. One of the buildings destroyed was the Cooper Lighting Plant, and a gas station in this area was damaged as well. Numerous trees and power poles were also downed in Southaven.|$|E

5|$|Bivalve fossils {{are formed}} when the {{sediment}} {{in which the}} shells are buried hardens into rock. Often, the impression made by the valves remains as the fossil rather than the valves. During the Early Ordovician, a great increase in the diversity of bivalve species <b>occurred,</b> <b>and</b> the dysodont, heterodont, and taxodont dentitions evolved. By the early Silurian, the gills were becoming adapted for filter feeding, and during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, siphons first appeared, which, with the newly developed muscular foot, allowed the animals to bury themselves deep in the sediment.|$|E
5|$|Due to both Mamie and Nelson, {{widespread}} flooding {{was reported}} {{across much of}} northern China, with 19rivers overflowing. The typhoon forced around 1,000factories to temporarily close, and toppled approximately 6.5million trees. Moreover, about 8,000homes were flooded and 120,000houses received damage Nearly 1million people were directly affected by the typhoon. The typhoon killed more than 120,000animals and sank more than 200boats. Overall, 17fatalities <b>occurred</b> <b>and</b> 165were injured. Losses totaled $172million (1985USD).|$|E
5|$|During its operation, Virgin Atlantic Little Red's fleet {{consisted}} of four Airbus A320s wet leased from Aer Lingus under a three-year contract. The aircraft had 29 rows of seating with a 3–3 configuration, {{for a total}} of 174 seats. The fleet was painted with Virgin Atlantic livery with future plans to eventually repaint them with Little Red livery. However, due to the closure of operations, this rebrand of the planes never <b>occurred</b> <b>and</b> they retained their original livery.|$|E

5|$|During the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma), Scotland lay {{close to}} the equator. Several changes in sea level <b>occurred</b> <b>and</b> the coal {{deposits}} of Lanarkshire and West Lothian and limestones of Fife and Dunbar date from this time. There are oil shales near Bathgate around which the 19th-century oil-processing industry developed, {{and elsewhere in the}} Midland Valley there are ironstones and fire clay deposits that had significance in the early Industrial Revolution. Fossil Grove in Victoria Park, Glasgow contains the preserved remains of a Carboniferous forest. More volcanic activity formed Arthur's Seat and the Salisbury Crags in Edinburgh and the nearby Bathgate Hills.|$|E
5|$|During the Permian, Triassic and Jurassic (300 to 150 Mya), further {{episodes of}} desertification, {{subsidence}} and uplift <b>occurred</b> <b>and</b> Wales was alternately inundated {{by the sea}} and raised above it. By the Cretaceous (140 to 70 Mya), Wales was permanently above sea level and in the Pleistocene (2.5 Mya to recent), it underwent several exceptionally cold periods, the ice ages. The mountains we see today largely assumed their present shape during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation.|$|E
5|$|Euryalus and Bacchante were {{transferred}} to Egypt in late January 1915 to reinforce the defences of the Suez Canal, although the Turkish raid on the Suez Canal had already been repulsed {{by the time that}} they arrived in February. Upon arrival Rear-Admiral Richard Peirse, commander of the East Indies Station, hoisted his flag in Euryalus. By this time the preliminary bombardments of the Turkish defences of the Dardanelles had already <b>occurred,</b> <b>and</b> the sisters {{were transferred}} north in March as the Turks east of the Canal proved to be reasonably quiet.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} on Saint Lucia destroyed about 15% of its yearly banana crop. Damage was heaviest on Martinique, where seven casualties <b>occurred</b> <b>and</b> 1,500people {{were left}} homeless as the heavy rainfall caused severe flooding on the island, resulting in some landslides. The remnant moisture of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, dropping heavy rainfall and causing four casualties; {{the same area}} was affected with more precipitation {{a few days later}} by Tropical Storm Marco. Due to the damage caused by the storm, the name Klaus was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E
5|$|However, {{although}} no structural brain damage occurs {{according to the}} classic definition, some researchers have included injuries in which structural damage has <b>occurred</b> <b>and</b> the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence definition includes physiological or physical disruption in the brain's synapses. Also, by definition, concussion has historically involved a loss of consciousness. However, the definition has evolved over time to include a change in consciousness, such as amnesia, although controversy continues about whether the definition should include only those injuries in which loss of consciousness occurs.|$|E
