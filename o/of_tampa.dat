5|$|Across the Western Caribbean, {{the storm}} {{produced}} heavy rainfall, causing some minor damage. In Florida, a moderate storm tide caused coastal damage and flooding, while Alberto's outer rainbands produced several tornadoes. The storm was indirectly responsible for two drownings {{off the coast}} <b>of</b> <b>Tampa</b> Bay. In North Carolina, heavy rainfall caused locally severe flooding, and one child drowned in a flooded storm drain near Raleigh. The remnants of Alberto produced strong winds and left four people missing in Atlantic Canada. Overall, damage was minor along Alberto's path.|$|E
5|$|On August 22, a {{tropical}} wave moved {{off the coast}} of Africa, and it moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without developing significantly. On September 1 the wave axis entered the Gulf of Mexico, and upon doing so convection steadily organized around a low-level center of circulation. The system moved northward and developed into Tropical Depression Twelve on September 3 while located about 300miles (480kilometers) west <b>of</b> <b>Tampa,</b> Florida. Embedded within a slow mid-latitude trough, the depression moved eastward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Henri on September 5.|$|E
5|$|On September 10, 2017, Hurricane Irma {{struck the}} Florida Keys {{and then made}} {{landfall}} near Marco Island in southwest Florida as a Category 3 storm. Irma moved north up {{the length of the}} Florida peninsula and had weakened to a Category 1 storm by the time it neared central Florida. On the night of September 10 and 11, the eye passed east <b>of</b> <b>Tampa</b> through eastern Hillsborough County, bringing at least tropical storm winds to the entire Tampa Bay area. Irma caused significant damage to the region, particularly to the electrical grid.|$|E

5|$|Pinellas County lies on a {{peninsula}} between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, {{and much}} of the city <b>of</b> <b>Tampa</b> lies on a smaller peninsula jutting out into Tampa Bay. This proximity to large bodies of water both moderates temperatures and introduces large amounts of humidity into the atmosphere. In general, the local communities farthest from the coast have larger temperature ranges, both during a single day and throughout the seasons of the year.|$|E

5|$|As {{the storm}} progressed westward, Tampa and nearby {{locations}} started to experience its effects. Strong winds {{from the northeast}} blew {{water out of the}} Tampa Bay to the lowest level ever recorded. The barometer fell to 961mbar (hPa; 28.4inHg), and extremely high waves battered the shore from Flamingo to Cape Romano. The surf continued well inland, forcing survivors to cling atop trees. North <b>of</b> <b>Tampa,</b> the hurricane's effects were moderate or light, while in the southwestern part of the state, damage increased in severity. A portion of the local citrus crop was destroyed. Property damage was widespread from Tampa to Jacksonville and points south. High winds tore the roofs off homes and shook some structures off their foundations.|$|E

Florida has no state income tax.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was poorly organized, {{with much of}} the convection located well to the southeast of the broad center due to strong upper-level wind shear. The shearing environment was caused by a trough in the Gulf of Mexico and from the outflow from Pacific Hurricane Celia. This was reflected in forecasts, with the National Hurricane Center predicting no significant change in intensity or structure. The depression moved northward before turning to the northeast, and on June 26 the poorly organized system made landfall just north <b>of</b> <b>Tampa,</b> Florida. The low-level circulation dissipated while crossing the Florida peninsula, with the remnants continuing northeastward before being absorbed by a large extratropical cyclone over the western Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|By August 15, {{convection}} {{began to}} consolidate around {{the center of}} the system as it passed over the Florida Keys. Early on August16, the system rapidly organized, with a low-level circulation developing roughly 80mi (130km) southwest <b>of</b> <b>Tampa,</b> Florida. Favorable environmental conditions led to the NHC anticipating the system to develop into a tropical depression later that day. Several hours later, the first advisory was issued on Tropical Depression Four. Low wind shear provided an environment that promoted quick development of the cyclone and the storm was forecast to attain tropical storm status within 12 hours. The depression tracked northwest around the periphery of a subtropical ridge to the east. Around 11:00am EDT, the NHC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Claudette in light of information from the NEXRAD Doppler weather radar in Tallahassee, Florida that found winds of 40mph (65km/h) around the center of circulation.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} tracked to {{the northwest}} through the Yucatán Channel into an area of increased wind shear, which left the center exposed and elongated. Despite its poor structure, the system maintained strong winds in its eastern semicircle. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alberto early on June 11 about 260miles (420km) southwest of the Dry Tortugas, based on Hurricane Hunters' reports of flight level winds of 50mph (80km/h) in a few convective bands. Upon becoming a tropical storm, the low-level circulation had become better defined, though forecasts predicted the wind shear would increase, preventing significant strengthening of the storm. One forecaster at the National Hurricane Center remarked the system resembled a subtropical cyclone. However, deep convection developed and built westward against the wind shear as the overall organization improved. At the same time Alberto turned northeastward {{under the influence of}} an approaching trough. On June 12, the circulation abruptly reformed under the area of deepest convection, which coincided with the storm's passage over the loop current; consequentially, Alberto quickly strengthened to reach peak winds of 70mph (115km/h) about 220miles (350km) west-northwest <b>of</b> <b>Tampa,</b> Florida.|$|E

Upon arrival, Eric is arrested for insulting a police officer, and the protagonist does favors for the local police department to secure his bail. However, when they arrive for the contest, it is revealed that Eric had only completed his own application form and not the protagonist's, forcing a dejected protagonist to try and impress competitors in the pro contest {{in order to gain}} admission. After impressing Tony Hawk, the protagonist wins the Best Trick event at Tampa AM and is offered deals by major skateboard sponsors, much to Eric's dismay. The protagonist then heads to San Diego, California to meet Todd, the manager of the team, and completes several photo shoots for a magazine. Following a wild celebration party, it is revealed that Eric has been picked up by the same sponsor.|$|E
5|$|Tropical storm {{warnings}} {{were issued}} for the Florida Keys, the Florida Bay, {{and from the}} Jupiter Inlet coast southward to Cape Sable on September28. A tropical storm watch was {{in place for the}} mainland north from the Jupiter Inlet to the Sebastian Inlet and north of East Cape Sable to Chokoloskee. The warnings and watch were discontinued the next day, after a direct impact was no longer expected. At the time, a flood watch remained in effect for Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade, Collier, and Monroe counties into September30. An airport weather warning was issued for Orlando International Airport and Executive Airport on September 28; arriving flights were put on hold, and pilots rerouted to other airports if possible. Eight Southwest Airlines flights were diverted to the airports <b>of</b> <b>Tampa</b> and Jacksonville, and one JetBlue flight to West Palm Beach. Though airport officials later reported normalized conditions, an additional 26 flights were canceled at Miami International Airport the next day.|$|E

5|$|While {{leading the}} team with 16 goals midway through the 2001–02 season, St. Louis {{suffered}} a broken leg following an awkward check by Josef Melichar of the Pittsburgh Penguins in a late January game. Consequently, he appeared in only 53 <b>of</b> <b>Tampa</b> Bay's 82 games, finishing with 35 points. He had a breakout season in 2002–03, finishing fourth in team scoring with 70 points and tying Vincent Lecavalier for the team lead with 33 goals. He led the team in plus-minus at +10 and appeared in his first NHL All-Star Game. St. Louis won the puck control relay event and {{finished second in the}} fastest skater events of the 2003 All-Star Game's skills competition. He scored his first career hat trick on January 30, 2003, in a game against the Carolina Hurricanes. In the postseason, Tampa Bay won its first playoff series in franchise history when it eliminated the Washington Capitals. Three of St. Louis' seven goals were game-winners, including the overtime goal in the sixth game that won the series. He led {{the team with}} 12 points in 11 playoff games.|$|E

Bass had previously served {{as head of}} scouting and defensive coordinator for the Cincinnati Bengals, the only team apart from the Buccaneers and Raiders that still maintained a human scouting staff instead of using the computerized services, and the team on whose model the Buccaneers’ expansion strategy was patterned. Bass was Paul Brown’s first coaching hire with the expansion Bengals, and previously had been an assistant under Sid Gillman with the San Diego Chargers, and with Don Coryell at San Diego State. Former McKay assistant and Utah State head coach Phil Krueger {{was added to the}} staff, joined shortly thereafter by USC assistants Wayne Fontes and Willie Brown, as defensive backs and receivers coaches, respectively. Dennis Fryzel, the last University <b>of</b> <b>Tampa</b> head coach, was added to handle special teams. Denver Broncos assistant Jerry Frei was hired as offensive line coach, becoming McKay’s first assistant hired from the professional ranks, and was followed by former New York Jets defensive coordinator Dick Voris, hired initially as defensive line coach. Abe Gibron, former head coach of the Chicago Bears and college teammate of McKay at Purdue, was brought on board as a defensive assistant. The staff was completed with the addition of Atlanta Falcons assistant and former Oakland Raiders and Buffalo Bills head coach John Rauch as offensive coordinator. Tampa resident Harry Smith, a trainer with experience working with local college athletes such as John Matuszak and Gary Huff, became the team’s strength and conditioning coach.|$|E
