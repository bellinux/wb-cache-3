5|$|The {{conventional}} {{level of}} moral reasoning is typical <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> and adults. To reason {{in a conventional}} way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of {{the third and fourth}} stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.|$|E
5|$|As {{predicted}} {{through the}} actions of the boys in the film, there were numerous news reports of underage South Park fans engaging in unsuccessful attempts to gain entrance to the film at theaters. There were reports <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> purchasing tickets for WB's own Wild Wild West and instead sitting in to see South Park. This came {{as a result of a}} movie-industry crackdown that would make it tougher for children to sneak into R-rated films, as proposed by President Bill Clinton at the time in response to the moral panic generated by the Columbine High School massacre, which occurred two months before the film's release. South Park was cited, along with American Pie, as an explicit film released in the summer of 1999 tempting teens to sneak into theaters. When the film was released in the United Kingdom in August 1999, there were similar reports of the film drawing an underage crowd.|$|E
5|$|Fred Gildersleeve, a Waco-based {{professional}} photographer, {{arrived at}} city hall shortly before the lynching, possibly at the mayor's request, and photographed the event. His photographs provide rare depictions of a lynching in progress, rather than typical lynching photography, which only shows dead victims. Gildersleeve's photographs include views of the crowd shot from a building and close images of Washington's body; some may have been taken by an assistant. Gildersleeve produced postcards featuring images <b>of</b> <b>adolescents,</b> some as young as twelve, gathered around Washington's body. The individuals in the photographs made no attempts to hide their identities. Berg believes that their willingness to be photographed indicates that they knew {{that no one would}} be prosecuted for Washington's death. Although some Waco residents sent the cards to out-of-town relatives, several prominent local citizens persuaded Gildersleeve to stop selling them, fearing that the images would come to characterize the town.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that, during adulthood, the offspring <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> rats differ in emotionality, learning and memory from the offspring of adult rats. The behavior of the offspring <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> (age, 50 - 55 days) and adult rats (age, 90 - 95 days) was tested in the open field, activity cage, and passive and active avoidance apparatus. The latencies during training and testing in the passive avoidance apparatus of the offspring <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> parents were shorter than the latencies of control offspring (P< 0. 001 on both training and testing days). Offspring <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> parents showed shorter latency time in acquisition trials during active avoidance testing compared to control offspring (P< 0. 001). They also showed a higher number of active avoidance responses in the last four blocks of acquisition (P< 0. 001) and first two blocks of extinction trials (P< 0. 05 and P< 0. 001, respectively). The offspring <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> parents showed higher latency on the first day of testing in the open field (P< 0. 01) and a lower latency on the third day of testing (P< 0. 01). They also showed higher activity during all three days of testing (1 st and 2 nd day: P< 0. 01; 3 rd day: P< 0. 05). The spontaneous activity of the offspring <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> parents in the activity cage was higher in the last three intervals of testing (P< 0. 001). In summary, the offspring <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> parents were less anxious and tended to be more active. The results of two learning and memory tests were opposite, but could be explained by a higher exploratory drive of the offspring <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> parents. This was probably due to chronic malnutrition stress and the disturbed mother-infant relationship in the litters <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> mothers...|$|R

25|$|Binge {{drinking}} {{is associated with}} a profound social harm, economic costs as well as increased disease burden. Binge {{drinking is}} more common in males, during adolescence and young adulthood. Heavy regular binge drinking {{is associated with a}}dverse effects on neurologic, cardiac, gastrointestinal, hematologic, immune, musculoskeletal organ systems as well as increasing the risk of alcohol induced psychiatric disorders. A US-based review of the literature found that up to one-third <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> binge-drink, with six percent reaching the threshold of having an alcohol-related substance use disorder. Approximately one in 25 women binge-drinks during pregnancy, which can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Binge drinking during adolescence is associated with traffic accidents and other types of accidents, violent behavior as well as suicide. The more often a child or adolescent binge drinks and the younger they are the more likely that they will develop an alcohol use disorder including alcoholism. A large number <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> who binge-drink also consume other psychotropic substances.|$|E
25|$|While {{adolescence}} {{is a time}} frequently marked by participation in the workforce, the number <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> in the workforce is much lower now than in years past {{as a result of}} increased accessibility and perceived importance of formal higher education.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examined the}} prediction of anxiety symptoms over time during developmentally significant periods - the transition to middle school (12 years old) and the transition to high school (15 years old). Specifically, relationships between child behavioral inhibition, paternal anxiety, maternal anxiety, and parental control and concurrent levels <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> anxiety {{at each time point}} were analyzed. Despite a strong research base supporting individual connections between child behavioral inhibition, levels of parental control, parental anxiety symptoms and adolescent anxiety, the joint longitudinal associations have received scant attention in the literature. The current study also compared two different models <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> anxiety, a mediated model <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> anxiety and a moderated model <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> anxiety, to determine which better fit the data. Data for the study was part of the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD), a study funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). Participants initially enrolled in the study were 1, 364 children (659 girls and 705 boys) and their caregivers and were recruited from 10 different geographic locations in the United States. The current study demonstrated associations between child behavioral inhibition, paternal anxiety, maternal anxiety, parental control and adolescent anxiety and suggests that they predict adolescent anxiety at 15 years. This study also indicated that earlier levels <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> and parental anxiety predict later levels <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> and parental anxiety and that parental anxiety symptoms have implications for concurrent and future levels <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> anxiety. Further research concerning the risk and protective factors as they relate to the etiology <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> anxiety should be explored to positively guide therapeutic interventions and shape appropriate parental behaviors...|$|R

25|$|Among {{young people}} {{engaging}} {{in some form}} of sexual activity, definitions of virginity differ. Virginity is usually defined as the state of a person who has never engaged in sexual intercourse, although there are some gray areas.

Of those polled, 70% <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> aged 11–16 believed oral sex did not disqualify someone from virginity, and 30% believed they were still abstinent.|$|E

However, 44% believed that one was abstinent after genital touching and 33% believed one could have oral sex and still remain abstinent. Of anal and vaginal sex, 14% believed one could engage in the former and 12% said one could participate in the latter while still remaining abstinent.|$|E
