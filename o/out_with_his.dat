Homer then pulls out an axe and angrily chases Bart for using the device.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, a {{dysentery}} epidemic swept communities {{along the}} Assiniboine River in Manitoba. On June 22 of that year, Belcourt left his mission at Baie-Saint-Paul {{to join a}} group of hunters on their journey south for the summer. The hunters carried the disease, infecting others, and 25 people died of dysentery by July 5. On the worst days, eight people had to be buried. Belcourt and six of the hunters travelled south to the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in search of medicine, as the priest's supply had quickly run <b>out.</b> <b>With</b> <b>his</b> medicine supplies replenished, the missionary {{headed back to the}} encampment of hunters before returning to his mission.|$|E

5|$|In late 2002, Miller {{divorced}} {{his wife}} Peg, {{with whom he}} had four sons. He did so to marry his long-term mistress Marie Challman, {{with whom he had}} been living since 1999. Challman was a hospital receptionist and Miller reasoned that he would receive more effective medical treatment by moving to Melbourne to live with her, as his specialist doctors also lived there. He had other long-term mistresses, including an Australian beauty queen with whom he was photographed in public. During his later years, his illness contributed to what his family felt was a deteriorating attitude and he fell <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> sons, but they were reconciled shortly before his death.|$|E
5|$|In the 1880s Muller {{was active}} for his businesses, and {{travelled}} to the Congo Conference in Berlin in 1884, to Portugal in 1886 and North Africa in 1889. In {{the same year}} he succeeded his father as consul general for Liberia in the Netherlands, a position he would hold until 1913. After a third business journey to Africa in 1890, now to Liberia and the Gold Coast, for Hendrik Muller & Co., he returned home seriously ill, and had to convalesce for months. In this period he fell <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> father and younger brother Abram Muller, about both personal and business matters. It was a personal break that would never be healed and with professional repercussions. In 1891 Muller left business for good and embarked on a totally new career.|$|E
5|$|Priestley also {{defended the}} rights of Dissenters against the attacks of William Blackstone, an eminent legal theorist, whose Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765–69) had become the {{standard}} legal guide. Blackstone's book stated that dissent from the Church of England was a crime and that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects. Furious, Priestley lashed <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> Remarks on Dr. Blackstone's Commentaries (1769), correcting Blackstone's interpretation of the law, his grammar (a highly politicised subject at the time), and history. Blackstone, chastened, altered subsequent editions of his Commentaries: he rephrased the offending passages and removed the sections claiming that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects, but he retained his description of Dissent as a crime.|$|E

5|$|Two {{days after}} the Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) program, Insane Clown Posse began its rescheduled {{nationwide}} tour with House of Krazees and Myzery. Their first concert, held in Orlando, Florida, was hand-picked by Insane Clown Posse and free to the public. Halfway through the tour, Brian Jones of House of Krazees had a falling <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> band members. Jones left the group, forcing House of Krazees to quit the tour. The success of the tour enabled Bruce and Utsler to purchase new houses both {{for each other and}} for their families. Bruce even told his mother to quit her job because he would pay her expenses.|$|E
5|$|After {{assuming}} his new position, Treloar {{was sent}} to AIF Headquarters in the Middle East where Australian forces were engaged in the North African Campaign. While {{en route to the}} Middle East he visited Malaya. Conditions in North Africa proved more challenging than those in World War I, however, as the combat was fast-moving and the Australian troops felt less motivation to collect artefacts than those of the First AIF. Treloar was supported by a small staff, but fell <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> second in command who questioned both how he administered the unit and his personal efficiency. He also lacked a patron in the AIF and was handicapped by his relatively junior rank. Due to his absence from the Memorial, Treloar had only limited input into the design of its galleries and he was unable to attend its official opening in November 1941.|$|E

5|$|Cerezeda finally set <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> {{expedition}} to the interior but was forced to return when Díaz de Herrera attempted to abandon Trujillo, taking all the colonists with him. Trujillo was now {{at the point of}} collapse; the Spanish lacked essential provisions, and although more Spanish soldiers had come to Honduras than were needed to overthrow Peru, the bitter Spanish infighting had resulted in the almost complete collapse of the colony. Trujillo was the only Spanish settlement left in the territory, and possessed less than 200 Spanish inhabitants. The Spanish assaults upon the native population had wreaked havoc upon them, but failed to successfully conquer any territory outside the immediate environs of Trujillo. The native population level collapsed, with many Indians being sold as slaves to supply the workforce on the plantations of the Caribbean islands. In 1533, an epidemic swept through the natives within the reduced Spanish area of control, killing half their number. The encomienda system was dysfunctional in the colony, with little tribute, and no rich mines of silver or gold. Many colonists had heard of the riches to be had in Peru, and threatened to leave. By 1534, the only richly inhabited native region left was the Naco valley; in desperation, Cerezeda once again planned to move the colony west to Naco.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{remained}} aloof {{from the}} Italian conflict, however. Over {{the spring and}} summer of 307AD, he had left Gaul for Britain to avoid any involvement in the Italian turmoil; now, instead of giving Maxentius military aid, he sent his troops against Germanic tribes along the Rhine. In 308AD, he raided the territory of the Bructeri, and made a bridge across the Rhine at Colonia Agrippinensium (Cologne). In 310AD, he marched to the northern Rhine and fought the Franks. When not campaigning, he toured his lands advertising his benevolence, and supporting the economy and the arts. His refusal to participate in the war increased his popularity among his people, and strengthened his power base in the West. Maximian returned to Rome in the winter of 307–308AD, but soon fell <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> son. In early 308AD, after a failed attempt to usurp Maxentius' title, Maximian returned to Constantine's court.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} sack, rumours reached the caliph that Theophilos was {{advancing}} to attack him. Mu'tasim set <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> army a day's march {{along the road}} in the direction of Dorylaion, but encountered no sign of a Byzantine attack. According to al-Tabari, Mu'tasim now pondered extending his campaign to attack Constantinople, when news reached him of a conspiracy headed by his nephew, al-Abbas ibn al-Ma'mun. Mu'tasim was forced to cut short his campaign and return quickly to his realm, leaving intact the fortresses around Amorium as well as Theophilos and his army in Dorylaion. Taking the direct route from Amorium to the Cilician Gates, both the caliph's army and its prisoners suffered in the march through the arid countryside of central Anatolia. Some captives were so exhausted that they could not move and were executed, whereupon others found the opportunity to escape. In retaliation, Mu'tasim, after separating the most prominent among them, executed the rest, some 6,000 in number.|$|E
