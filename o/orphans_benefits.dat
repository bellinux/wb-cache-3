As access to orphan medicinal products depends on assessment and appraisal by health authorities, this article is focused on health technology assessment (HTA) and reimbursement decision-making considerations for orphan drugs. A critical analysis may identify important factors that could predetermine the combined outcomes of these two processes. Following this objective, an analytical framework was developed, comprising three overlaying issues: to outline what is currently done and {{what needs to be}} done in the field of HTA of orphan drugs, to synthesize important variables relevant to the reimbursement decision-making about orphan drugs, and to unveil relationships between theory and practice. Methods for economic evaluation, cost-effectiveness threshold, budget impact, uncertainty of evidence, criteria in reimbursement decision-making, and HTA research agenda are all explored and discussed from an orphan drug perspective. Reimbursement decision-making for orphan drugs is a debate of policy priorities, health system specifics, and societal attitudes. Health authorities need to pursue a multidisciplinary analysis on a range of criteria, ensuring an explicit understanding of the trade-offs for decisions related to eligibility for reimbursement. The only reasonable way to accept a higher valuation of <b>orphan</b> drug <b>benefits</b> is if these are demonstrated empirically. Rarity means that the quality of orphan drug evidence is not the same as for conventional therapies. Closing this gap is another crucial point for the timely access to these products. The generation of evidence goes far beyond pre-market authorization trials and requires transnational cooperation and coordination. Early constructive dialogue among orphan drug stakeholders and elaboration of orphan drug-tailored methodology tools could set the scene for ongoing accumulation of evidence, as well as for proper and timely assessment and appraisal.

40|$|Abstract Pricing and {{reimbursement}} of orphan {{drugs are}} {{an issue of}} high priority for policy makers, legislators, health care professionals, industry leaders, academics and patients. This study aims to conduct a literature review to {{provide insight into the}} drivers of orphan drug pricing and reimbursement. Although orphan drug pricing follows the same economic logic as drug pricing in general, the monopolistic power of orphan drugs results in high prices: a) <b>orphan</b> drugs <b>benefit</b> from a period of marketing exclusivity; b) few alternative health technologies are available; c) third-party payers and patients have limited negotiating power; d) manufacturers attempt to maximise orphan drug prices within the constraints of domestic pricing and reimbursement policies; and e) substantial R&D costs need to be recouped from a small number of patients. Although these conditions apply to some orphan drugs, they do not apply to all orphan drugs. Indeed, the small number of patients treated with an orphan drug and the limited economic viability of orphan drugs can be questioned in a number of cases. Additionally, manufacturers have an incentive to game the system by artificially creating monopolistic market conditions. Given their high price for an often modest effectiveness, orphan drugs are unlikely to provide value for money. However, additional criteria are used to inform reimbursement decisions in some countries. These criteria may include: the seriousness of the disease; the availability of other therapies to treat the disease; and the cost to the patient if the medicine is not reimbursed. Therefore, the maximum cost per unit of outcome that a health care payer is willing to pay for a drug could be set higher for orphan drugs to which society attaches a high social value. There is a need for a transparent and evidence-based approach towards orphan drug pricing and reimbursement. Such an approach should be targeted at demonstrating the relative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and economic viability of orphan drugs with a view to informing pricing and reimbursement decisions. </p...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the turn}} of the millennium, Zimbabwe has {{witnessed}} a raft of socio-economic and political problems characterised by hyper-inflation; shortage of basic commodities; dwindling fiscal reserves; ballooning domestic and foreign debt; falling standard of living and high levels of migration. The devastating effects of the Aids pandemic have not helped the situation. With estimates indicating that there are more than million orphaned children, social security programmes have been overstretched resulting in the State failing to adequately provide for the needs of these orphans in the country. It is against this background that the study sought to explore the community level initiatives that communities are taking {{to meet the needs of}} orphans through community based programmes. The goal of the study was to explore the contribution of social entrepreneurship in meeting the needs of orphans in the Mberengwa district, Zimbabwe. The study was conducted using a qualitative research approach. The study was exploratory and the type of research was applied. The collective case study design was utilised. A total of twenty participants took part in the study; including six children who were benefiting from the income generating projects, four key informants who work closely with the projects as well as ten villagers who were involved in the day to day running of the projects. The participants were selected from two villages that have the projects <b>benefiting</b> <b>orphans.</b> The participants were selected through purposive sampling. Data was collected from the children and key informants by way of interviews and from the villagers through focus group discussions. The findings show that the government of Zimbabwe lacks capacity to meet the needs of orphans due to the socio-economic and political challenges and as a result, communities in Mberengwa district have taken the initiative to care for the orphans in their area through income generating projects. The income generating projects are social entrepreneurial ventures in that they aim at generating profits which are channelled towards meeting the needs of the orphans. Through the income generating projects, the orphans in Mberengwa district are able to access their needs which include food, education, clothing, shelter, birth registration and protection from abuse. Findings also indicated that in the Mberengwa district, orphan care is viewed as a community, rather than individual responsibility. Furthermore, the findings indicated that the communities in Mberengwa have inherent strengths which make it possible for them to work together in achieving common objectives. Consequently, their social ties and close social relations enable them to work together to deal with problems confronting them collectively. vi projects <b>benefiting</b> <b>orphans.</b> The participants were selected through purposive sampling.

It was concluded that income generating projects based on social entrepreneurial principles are a critical poverty alleviation and social protection mechanism for orphans in the Mberengwa communities as they lead to meeting their needs and furthermore, alleviate social problems in the community. In order to respond to the gap created by the government’s lack of capacity to care for the orphans, social entrepreneurship through income generating projects can be utilised to achieve social protection and poverty alleviation goals more so in the country’s quest to meet the Millennium Development Goals. Recommendations include the need to review the legal and policy framework governing the care and protection of orphans in the country to include community-based programmes. Furthermore, it is recommended to strengthen traditional orphan care structures in facilitating income generating projects based on social entrepreneurial principles as they have the propensity to help meet the needs of orphans at the community level.

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Recreation Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. HIV/AIDS is {{a growing}} {{pandemic}} -not only in South Africa, but also globally. Worldwide there are currently more than 40 million people living with HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS, 2006 : 8). The increasing number of HIV-infections also leads {{to an increase in}} the number of deaths related to HIV/AIDS. A result of the mortality rate is the increasing number of children who are orphaned. It is projected by Dorrington et al. (2006 : 25) that, in South Africa, nearly 2. 2 million children will be orphaned as a result of AIDS by 2015. The death of a parent, especially due to AIDS, is a very traumatic and stressful event. Exposure to such an event is a main factor leading to risk behaviour (Anon, 2002 : 2). AIDS is endangering the future of youth in South Africa. Recreation programmes can playa changing role in managing the effects the AIDS pandemic has on AIDS orphans (Brown & Lourie, 2000 : 86). Recreation programmes can help improve the health of these youths and assist in solving the emotional, social and psychological problems they face. Numerous research findings supported this notion that recreation participation can be beneficial on a personal, social, environmental and economic level (Tesnear, 2004 : 78; Bloemhoff, 2006 : 1 - 11; Meyer, 2007 : 97; Louw, 2008 : 138). The purpose of this study was firstly, to determine the necessity for recreation programmes for AIDS orphans based on the perspectives of the staff working with these youths and those of the youths themselves. Secondly, to determine the benefits associated with recreation participation for AIDS orphans according to the perspectives of the staff working with these youths and the youths themselves. A qualitative research design was used for the collection of the data in this study. Thanda After-School Programme was use as a case study. The participants were recruited purposively to form a non-probability sample. The sample size (n= 17) was determined through data saturation. The sample was divided into two groups, staff at Thanda ASP (n= 9) and students at Thanda ASP (n= 8). Data gathering was done by means of a semi-structure interview with each of the participants as well as analysis of personal documents written by the participants. Data analysis was done by means of the following steps: planning for recording data; data collection and preliminary analysis; organising the data; reading and writing memos; generating categories, themes and patterns; coding the data; testing; and representing. Through the process of data analysis two main categories were identified, namely the necessity for recreation programmes for AIDS <b>orphans</b> and the <b>benefits</b> of recreation programmes for AIDS orphans. The necessity was accentuated by both the staff and the students of Thanda ASP. Both highlighted this through their responses to the question as to why they are involved in Thanda ASP as well as the reason for the students' risk behaviour before their involvement in the programme. Health, emotional, social and psychological improvement were the key themes that emerged with regard to the <b>benefits</b> to ADIS <b>orphans</b> as a result of recreation participation. These benefits were stated by the majority of staff members as well as students at Thanda ASP and it was also echoed in the journals written by the students. The participants, staff and students alike, strongly emphasised the improvement of the youths' future perspectives and improvement of life skills. The results from this study compare positively with what is stated in the literature and with previous research. Based on these results, recreation programmes for AIDS orphans can be regarded as beneficial to and thus essential for the improvement of quality of life. Master...|$|R

This first took the shape of fundraising for international humanitarian crises, but eventually grew into various financial aid and scholarship opportunities to <b>benefit</b> <b>orphaned</b> students from around the world. Why study in Japan? Japan is a global leader in higher education, with its universities consistently ranking among the top in Asia and featuring in lists of the best universities around the world. Through the Global 30 University initiative, Japan’s universities are also more open and international than ever. Japan is also considered a forerunner in technology, sustainability, and the drive for global peace. Students studying here will benefit greatly from seeing how this country is able to attain high levels of development, while still maintaining relative harmony among its population as well as a balance between globalization and tradition. Our student support team Moving far away to a country quite different from one’s own can be daunting, which is why all of our students who study in the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan, Australia, and New Zealand are looked after by our experienced student support team. They are there to ensure you get the support you need {{to make the most of}} the university experience, and also so that you have someone to turn to with any problems or questions. Ashinaga Uganda and Senegal Since 2006, Ashinaga has been providing support and financial aid to students in Uganda, so that they can pursue their undergraduate studies in Japan. Typically, we have supported two students per year, who then are offered housing at our Ashinaga Kokoro-Juku in either Kobe or Tokyo. Previous students have studied at Waseda University, International Christian University, Sophia University, Meiji University, Doshisha University, Kyoto University, and many others. Ashinaga has also begun giving scholarships to high school students from Uganda and Senegal to study at senior high schools in Japan. This intensive, immersive program allows students to quickly excel in their Japanese language skills. Learn more about Ashinaga’s activities in Sub-Saharan Africa Ashinaga Africa Initiative Students on the Ashinaga Africa Initiative are also encouraged to undertake their studies in Japan. The Ashinaga Africa Initiative hopes to contribute to the continued development of Sub-Saharan Africa through providing a high-quality education to ambitious orphaned students who want to use that education to make a difference. One-year Programs Ashinaga currently runs a one-year exchange program for orphaned students from Indonesia and Vietnam currently studying at our partner institutions, Airlangga University and the Sakura Japanese Language School. Interested students should contact their school directly. Rainbow Exchange In exchange for accepting our Japanese students at their institutions as part of our Overseas Training Program, Ashinaga invites students from Kocaeli University and Airlangga University to Japan every year. Invitees spend the summer interacting with Ashinaga students, learning Japanese, and learning about Japanese culture. Learn more about the Overseas Training Program for Japanese students Past Programs International summer camps From 2000 to 2005, Ashinaga held annual international summer camps, or international tsudoi, in which students from 15 different countries gathered and shared memorable experiences with one another. These gatherings brought together orphaned students from Afghanistan, Algeria, Colombia, El Salvador, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Malaysia, Maldives, Serbia Montenegro (Kosovo), Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, and the USA. Through these camps, students were able to discover that despite the national and linguistic barriers tht divided them, they shared the pain of losing a parent and becoming orphaned.
