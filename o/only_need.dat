5|$|A limerick is a {{poem that}} {{consists}} of five lines and is often humorous. Rhythm {{is very important in}} limericks for the first, second and fifth lines must have seven to ten syllables. However, the third and fourth lines <b>only</b> <b>need</b> five to seven. All of the lines must rhyme and have the same rhythm.|$|E

5|$|Donkeys, like mules, need less {{protein and}} more fiber than horses. Although the donkey’s {{gastrointestinal}} tract has no marked differences in structure {{to that of}} the horse, donkeys are more efficient at digesting food and thrive on less forage than a similar sized pony. They <b>only</b> <b>need</b> to eat 1.5% of their body weight per day in dry matter. It is not fully understood why donkeys are such efficient digestors, but it is thought that they may have a different microbial population in the large intestine than do horses, or possibly an increased gut retention time.|$|E

5|$|During the {{transition}} period participants in energy, fossil fuels and industry will <b>only</b> <b>need</b> to surrender one NZU for two tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. Free allocation of units to energy-intensive and trade-exposed activities will also be halved. Secondly, participants may pay a fixed price of NZ$25 instead of buying and surrendering units. This measure means that firms will face a cost of no higher than NZ$12.50 per tonne of emissions. There is a restriction {{on the sale of}} units oversea during this transition period, except for forest removal credits.|$|E
5|$|Each of the valid Band1 {{permutations}} can {{be expanded}} (completed) into a specific number of solutions with the Band2,3 permutations. By {{virtue of their}} similarity, each member of an equivalence class {{will have the same}} number of completions. Consequently, we <b>only</b> <b>need</b> to construct the solutions for one member of each equivalence class and then multiply the number of solutions {{by the size of the}} equivalence class. We are still left with the task of identifying and calculating the size of each equivalence class. Further progress requires the dexterous application of computational techniques to catalogue (classify and count) the permutations into equivalence classes.|$|E
5|$|In state-run institutions, {{students}} <b>only</b> <b>need</b> pay registration fees; {{there are}} no tuition fees. Private institutions, however, charge fees. All students are eligible to some financial support from the Icelandic Student Loan Fund; the exact amount depends on their financial and personal situation. The student must begin to repay this money two years after completing their study programme. In addition to Icelandic students, students from the European Union or EEA-EFTA member states are also eligible to apply for loans, {{if they have been}} working in their trade in the country for at least one year.|$|E

5|$|Magic in Vagrant Story {{is learned}} {{later in the}} game using Grimoires that are dropped by enemies. Once a Grimoire is used, the magic spell {{associated}} with the Grimoire {{will remain in the}} menu, and players <b>only</b> <b>need</b> to spend magic points (MP) to cast a learned spell. Magic spells can be used to attack, heal, create status effects, and manipulate Ashley's elemental and enemy affinities. Certain magic spells allow the player to affect multiple targets by using a small sphere positioned within the Battle Mode wire frame. Unlike physical attacks however, magic attacks cannot be chained.|$|E
5|$|This article poses {{two general}} limits to {{non-member}} states. First, only European states {{are eligible for}} new membership, and second, these states not <b>only</b> <b>need</b> the approval of all the existing member states, but every member state can put some criteria forward {{that have to be}} attained. In practice, NATO formulates a common set of criteria, but for instance Greece blocks the Republic of Macedonia's accession to NATO, due to the disagreement over the use of the name Macedonia. Turkey similarly opposes the participation of the Republic of Cyprus with NATO institutions as long as the Cyprus dispute is not resolved.|$|E
5|$|In April1995, when Parliament {{decided to}} nationalize twenty-six {{regional}} airports owned by their respective municipalities, they also debated {{a proposal to}} build a new airport in Båtsfjord. At the time Widerøe was obliged to operate routes to the airport until 31March1997. In December1995, Widerøe took delivery of their fifteenth Dash8 and thus their <b>only</b> <b>need</b> for a Twin Otter was to serve Båtsfjord. From 1994 to 1997, the cost estimates for the new airport increased from NOK95 to 125million. By June1998, Parliament approved additional funding which brought the cost to NOK178 million, including a new county road for NOK8million. The airport opened on 9 September 1999. From the opening Widerøe used the Twin Otter until 1April2000, when the route was taken over by larger Dash8 aircraft. Airport security was introduced on 1January2005.|$|E

5|$|Tizard put his {{thoughts}} in a 27 April 1936 letter to Hugh Dowding, {{who was at}} that time the Air Member for Research and Development. He also sent a copy to Watt, who forwarded it to the researchers who were moving to their new research station at Bawdsey Manor. In a meeting at the Crown and Castle pub, Bowen pressed Watt for permission to form a group to study the possibility of placing a radar on the aircraft itself. This would mean the CH stations would <b>only</b> <b>need</b> to get the fighter into the general area of the bomber, the fighter would be able to use its own radar {{for the rest of the}} interception. Watt was eventually convinced that the staffing needed to support development of both CH and a new system was available, and the Airborne Group was spun off from the CH effort in August 1936.|$|E
5|$|Further {{treatment}} for other complications such as seizure, hypotension, cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary edema, and acidosis may be required. Increased muscle activity and seizures {{should be treated}} with dantrolene or diazepam; diazepam should only be given with appropriate respiratory support. Hypotension requires treatment with intravenous fluids; vasopressors {{may be required to}} treat myocardial depression. Cardiac dysrhythmias are treated with standard advanced cardiac life support protocols. If severe, metabolic acidosis is treated with sodium bicarbonate. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate is controversial as acidosis may increase tissue oxygen availability. Treatment of acidosis may <b>only</b> <b>need</b> to consist of oxygen therapy. The delayed development of neuropsychiatric impairment {{is one of the most}} serious complications of carbon monoxide poisoning. Brain damage is confirmed following MRI or CAT scans. Extensive follow up and supportive treatment is often required for delayed neurological damage. Outcomes are often difficult to predict following poisoning, especially people who have symptoms of cardiac arrest, coma, metabolic acidosis, or have high carboxyhemoglobin levels. One study reported that approximately 30% of people with severe carbon monoxide poisoning will have a fatal outcome. It has been reported that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may increase the likelihood of delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) after carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.|$|E
