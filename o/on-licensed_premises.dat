50|$|There {{are many}} {{exemption}} categories and qualifications {{to the above}} definitions, particularly in respect of Regulated Entertainment and Late Night Refreshment. As a result of changes by the Live Music Act 2012, for example, live music in <b>on-licensed</b> <b>premises</b> {{is no longer a}} licensable activity between 08:00 and 23:00 hours before audiences of up to 200 people. Similarly performances of plays and of dance are not licensable before audiences of up to 500 people and indoor sporting events up to 1000 people. These changes, brought in from 2013, coupled with the Live Music Act in 2012, display a readiness by the Coalition Government to deregulate the prescriptive and sometimes confusing definitions of Regulated Entertainment stated above (although {{it should be noted that}} the Live Music Act was a Private Members’ Bill sponsored by Lord Clement-Jones and drafted by Poppleston Allen Solicitors which was subsequently supported by the Government).|$|E
50|$|Throughout the United Kingdom, {{the sale}} of alcohol is restricted—pubs, restaurants, shops and other {{premises}} must be licensed by the local authority. In England, Wales and Scotland the authority to sell alcohol {{is divided into two}} parts - the Premises Licence, which prescribes the times and conditions under which alcohol can be sold, and a Personal Licence which allows individuals to sell alcohol or authorise its sale by others. Every Premises Licence which authorises {{the sale of}} alcohol must also name a Designated Premises Supervisor (Designated Premises Manager in Scotland) (“DPS” or “DPM” for short) who must hold a valid Personal Licence - otherwise alcohol cannot be sold at that premises. The DPS has day-to-day responsibility for the sale of alcohol at licensed premises. Premises licences, in as far as they concern the sale of alcohol, can be categorised to include on-licences (allowing consumption of alcohol on the premises) and off-licences. However, these distinctions are not explicitly made in the Licensing Act 2003, and the position in Scotland and Northern Ireland is more complex. Many <b>on-licensed</b> <b>premises</b> also permit off-sales.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Licensed {{premises}} {{are associated}} with a considerable level of alcohol-related harm. This study examined the effectiveness of an educational policing strategy, implemented as routine policing practice, {{to reduce the number of}} patrons of licensed premises involved in police-recorded incidents of violence, disorder and motor vehicle crashes. Participants: The educational policing strategy targeted <b>on-licensed</b> <b>premises</b> registered as operating in 2003. The strategy was delivered by police and was overseen by the research team. Setting: The intervention was conducted in 21 non-metropolitan New South Wales Police Force commands. Intervention: On the basis of routinely collected and recorded police data, premises received one of three levels of police response on three separate occasions from December 2002 to July 2003. The police responses were letters, incident reports, covert audits and feedback meetings. Outcomes: The rate of patrons who had last consumed alcohol on licensed premises before being involved in police-recorded incidents decreased from 1. 24 per premises in the 4 -month baseline period to 1. 11 in the 4 -month follow-up period (p= 0. 08). There was a significant reduction, from 7. 08 to 5. 65 patrons (p= 0. 03), in such a rate for high-risk premises that received the most intensive police response. High-risk premises also recorded a significant reduction in the rate of intoxicated patrons involved in such incidents, from 5. 50 to 4. 40 (p= 0. 05). Conclusion: The findings suggest a potential benefit of an educational policing strategy in reducing alcohol-related harm associated with licensed premises. Further implementation of this strategy concurrent with rigorous evaluation is warranted...|$|E

Den søker å svare på når og hvor overskjenking foregår, og gir noen mulige forklaringer på funnene. Undersøkelsen er gjort på oppdrag av Sosial- og helsedirektoratet, og fokuserer også på effekter av Ansvarlig Vertskap i Bergen. Rapporten bygger på testkjøp på 55 skjenkesteder i Bergen sentrum i {{november}} 2006. Ved bruk av skuespillere som spilte svært beruset ble det testet om fulle gjester får servering og hva som skjer når gjestene bestiller. Antall overskjenkinger i Bergen har økt fra 63 prosent i 2003 til 84 prosent i 2006. I denne perioden har opplæring i Ansvarlig Vertskap blitt obligatorisk for alle ansatte på steder som har åpent til kl tre på natta i Bergen. I rapporten presenteres mulige forklaringer på overskjenkingen. Resultatene viser at det er lettere for svært berusede å få servering når det er høy musikk, mange gjester i lokalet og beruselsesnivået generelt er høyt. Mannlige skuespillere ble nektet servering noe oftere enn kvinner, og kvinnelige bartendere nektet å servere noe oftere enn mannlige. Den kulturelle konteksten blir framhevet som en viktig faktor. Den uformelle aksepten av beruselse er sterk i Norge, ikke minst blant de unge gjestene og ansatte på utestedene. Denne allmenne aksepten kan være mer avgjørende for om fulle gjester får servering enn lovens bestemmelser. Forskerne konkluderer med at det fortsatt er behov for mer og bedre opplæring om overskjenking og dens konsekvenser for ansatte i skjenkenæringen. Men kursingen må følges av mer og bedre kontroller, og alkoholloven må faktisk håndheves. ENGLISH SUMMARY: Under {{the provisions}} of the Alcohol Act, it is forbidden to serve alcoholic beverages to customers of bars and restaurants that are ”obviously {{under the influence of alcohol}} or drugs” (”åpenbart påvirket av rusmidler”). Despite this, overserving is known to be a highly prevalent occurrence. But we also know that other countries, not least Sweden, have had marked success in their efforts to reduce overserving by running staff training programmes. This report sets out the results of the first Norwegian study of overserving in bars and restaurants after most of the staff had completed a responsible alcohol serving programme. In addition to exploring the prevalence of overserving, we seek to explain why over¬serving takes place. Since 2000, more than 1, 200 serving staff in the hospitality trade in Bergen have attended a Responsible host programme. In 2003 the programme became compulsory for workers in bars and restaurants with extended opening hours. In the same period, from 2000 to the end of 2006, more than 7, 000 on-site inspections were carried out to monitor overserving. Only eight violations were reported, however, indicating either broad compliance with the Alcohol Act in Bergen, or a failure of the inspectors to report infringements. Over one weekend in November 2006, test purchases were made at 55 bars and restaurants in the centre of Bergen. By using actors to play inebriated customers, we were able to see whether they were served and to record aspects of the interaction and setting. The study also involved participant observation, qualitative interviews and document analysis. Our findings indicate that overserving is very widespread indeed, despite the fact that most of the staff involved in these situations had gone through the responsible serving programme. In 84 per cent of all test situations, the ”inebriated” customer received what s/he’d ordered, a rise of 21 per centage point since the previous evaluation, done in 2003. Although all serving staff at <b>on-licensed</b> <b>premises</b> with opening hours extending after midnight had attended the responsible serving programme, we did not observe a single case of our ”drunk customer” not being served in the last hour before closing, between 2 and 3 am. Since customers have probably consumed alcohol the whole evening, this is when most customers are likely to be drunk. Staff at a third of the 46 bars/restaurants did express misgivings about the customer’s state, but went on to serve him/her all the same. What the staff did in effect was to refrain from taking responsibility and “pass the buck” on to the customer saying something like ”you can have a beer, but nothing stronger!”, to the customer’s sober companion, ”You’ll just have to look after him!”, or to the bouncer, ”Since the bouncer let you in, then [...] . !”. To understand the underlying causes of overserving we looked at the physical context, the people involved and Norwegian drinking culture. And what we found was that our “drunk” actor would be more likely to be served if the place was crowded, the music was loud, and other customers had already drunk to excess. We also discovered that our male actors were more likely to be turned down than the female actors. Regarding the bar staff, female servers were more likely to refuse to serve “drunk” customers than male servers, and older than younger servers. In most cases, the explanation for overserving is complex and a mix of several factors. One of the most influential factors however, is probably the drinking culture. Pubs and restaurants satisfy several social needs, and represent a setting where, for many customers, getting drunk plays an important role. Indeed, drinking to excess – within certain limits – is both expected and accepted behaviour, especially among younger age-groups. This is the age-group that consumes most alcohol and has the highest incidence of drunkenness. Daily life in the hospitality trade is often hectic. Customers want to enjoy themselves and drink in quantity. And it seems that behavioural norms that apply elsewhere in society are replaced by others, resulting in a collective acceptance of drunkenness. Refusing to serve a customer may therefore be felt as transgressing informal social norms. Whether a drunken customer is served or not, clearly other mechanisms are at play than the Alcohol Act. Our study shows a need for improved training programmes, heightened awareness about overserving and its consequences. The Responsible host programme trains the staff in conflict avoidance methods and prevention of drink-related violence. Information on overserving is however only a small part of the short programme, which in its present configuration at least is clearly not having much of an effect on the prevalence of overserving. It is also a well known fact the increased knowledge does not necessarily result in modified behaviour. Training also needs following up with practical steps to enforce the law; inspections should be held more frequently and control measures improved. If businesses break the law, sanctions should be used. Given its mission to “to curb to the greatest possible extent the harm to society and the individual that may result from the consumption of alcoholic beverages”, the Alcohol Act has, together with local licensing byelaws, a large, but possibly unused potential as a preventive mechanism...|$|E
