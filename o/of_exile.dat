5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades <b>of</b> <b>Exile,</b> {{replacing}} the Blades of Athena used in previous installments {{and the opening}} moments of this game. The weapon {{is a pair of}} blades that are attached to chains wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms, which can be swung in a number of maneuvers. During the game, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Claws of Hades, the Nemean Cestus, and the Nemesis Whip—with other combat options. The Nemean Cestus, a pair of gauntlets, and the Nemesis Whip, which is similar to the Blades <b>of</b> <b>Exile,</b> are required to advance in parts of the game; for example, the Nemean Cestus is needed to break through objects composed of onyx.|$|E

5|$|John of Fordun {{wrote that}} Duncan's wife fled Scotland, taking her children, {{including}} the future kings Malcolm III (Máel Coluim mac Donnchada) and Donald III (Domnall Bán mac Donnchada, or Donalbane) with her.

William Robertson proposes the safest place for Duncan's widow and her children would be with her or Duncan's kin and supporters in Atholl.|$|E

During their period <b>of</b> <b>exile,</b> rivalry between the various factions became obvious, a conflict which became the basis for political allegiances in later years.|$|E

5|$|Abd al-Rahman's son Sayyid al-Siddiq al-Mahdi was Imam of the Ansar for {{the next}} two years.

Sadiq Al-Mahdi was arrested in 1970, and for many years alternated between spells in prison in Sudan and periods <b>of</b> <b>exile.</b> In 1985 Sadiq al-Mahdi was again elected president of the Umma party. In the 1986 elections he became Prime Minister of Sudan, holding office until the government was overthrown in 1989. After further imprisonment and exile, Sadiq al-Mahdi returned to Sudan in 2000 and in 2002 was elected Imam of the Ansar. In 2003 Sadiq Al-Mahdi was re-elected President of Umma.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from exile, Æthelbald of Mercia succeeded Coelred and afterwards endowed {{the church at}} Crowland. Ælfwald's friendly stance towards Æthelbald helped to maintain peaceful relations with his more powerful neighbour. The Life of Guthlac, which includes information about Æthelbald during his period <b>of</b> <b>exile</b> at Crowland, is dedicated to Ælfwald. Later versions of the Life reveal the high quality of written Old English produced in East Anglia during Ælfwald's reign. He was a literate and devoutly Christian king: his letter written to Boniface in around 747 reveals his diplomatic skills and gives a rare glimpse {{into the life of}} a ruler who is otherwise shrouded in obscurity.|$|E
5|$|Audioslave was an American rock {{supergroup}} {{formed in}} Los Angeles in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave {{as a combination}} of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, Out <b>of</b> <b>Exile,</b> {{it was noted that}} they had established a separate identity. Audioslave's sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals.|$|E
5|$|Bristol {{was founded}} by 1000; by about 1020, it was a trading centre with a mint {{producing}} silver pennies bearing its name. By 1067 Brycgstow was a well-fortified burh, and that year the townsmen beat off a raiding party from Ireland led by three of Harold Godwinson's sons. Under Norman rule, the town {{had one of the}} strongest castles in southern England. Bristol was the place <b>of</b> <b>exile</b> for Diarmait Mac Murchada, the Irish king of Leinster, after being overthrown. The Bristol merchants subsequently played a prominent role in funding Richard Strongbow de Clare and the Norman invasion of Ireland.|$|E

He was allowed to work in an occupation of his own choosing, and earned his living tutoring local children in mathematics and foreign languages (he knew French, German and Lithuanian in addition to Russian and his native Polish; he would later learn English). Local officials decided that as a Polish noble he was not entitled to the 10-ruble pension received by most other exiles.|$|E
5|$|In 1987 Rambhadradas {{established}} a religious {{and social service}} institution called Tulsi Peeth (The seat of Tulsi) in Chitrakoot, where, according to the Ramayana, Rama had spent twelve out of his fourteen years <b>of</b> <b>exile.</b> As {{the founder of the}} seat, the title of Śrīcitrakūṭatulasīpīṭhādhīśvara (literally, the Lord of the Tulsi Peeth at Chitrakoot) was bestowed upon him by Sadhus and intellectuals. In the Tulsi Peeth, he arranged for a temple devoted to Rama and his consort Sita to be constructed, which is known as Kanch Mandir ("glass temple").|$|E

The following week, however, it dropped to number three, with a 62-percent sales decrease—consequently reaching platinum. Cornell admitted to writing his most personal songs ever on this album, influenced by the positive changes in his life since 2002. He also described the album as more varied than the debut and relying less on heavy guitar riffs.|$|E
5|$|The trial De Iniusta details {{took place}} at Salisbury in November 1088, and {{concerned}} St-Calais' equivocal actions in the revolt against King William II's rule {{that had taken place}} earlier in the year. The work is one of the primary sources for the early part of King William II's reign, and was probably compiled from notes taken by the bishop's subordinates and then worked into a tractate that was designed to present the bishop's case in the best light. It was probably composed during the 1090s when St-Calais was engaged in an effort to regain the favour of King William after his return from the sentence <b>of</b> <b>exile</b> he received at the trial.|$|E
5|$|The {{writing of}} Roa Bastos spans four countries, six decades, and countless genres. In his {{lifetime}} he made important contributions to Latin American Boom writing, to the related Dictator Novel, {{and to the}} Nuevo Cine film movement through screenplays like Alias Gardelito (1961). Roa Bastos' influence {{can be found in}} the works of many foreign post-boom writers, including Mempo Giardinelli, Isabel Allende, Eraclio Zepeda, Antonio Skármeta, Saul Ibargoyen, and Luisa Valenzuela. The most important author to come out of Paraguay, he also remains highly influential for a new generation of Paraguayan authors. Roa Bastos' relationship with his country, unbroken by over 40 years <b>of</b> <b>exile,</b> was considered so important that in 1989 he was invited back by Paraguay's new president, Andrés Rodríguez, following the collapse of the Stroessner regime.|$|E
