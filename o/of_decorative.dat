5|$|A {{commission}} {{to create a}} portal for Paris' planned Museum <b>of</b> <b>Decorative</b> Arts was awarded to Rodin in 1880. Although the museum was never built, Rodin worked throughout his life on The Gates of Hell, a monumental sculptural group depicting scenes from Dante's Inferno in high relief. Often lacking a clear conception of his major works, Rodin compensated with hard work and a striving for perfection.|$|E
5|$|Japanese lacquerware {{has a long}} history, {{back as far as}} the Jōmon period, because <b>of</b> <b>decorative</b> {{value and}} the quality as {{protective}} finish. Initially lacquer was used to enhance properties of utilitarian objects such as watertight drinking vessels, cooking and household goods. The oldest extant decorated item dates to the 6th century; in the medieval and early modern period lacquer was used in the manufacture of many products such as toiletry boxes, inkstone cases, eating utensils, plates, bowls, containers, furniture, saddles, stirrups or armour.|$|E

5|$|Oldham's {{museum and}} gallery service {{dates back to}} 1883. Since then it has {{established}} itself as a cultural focus for Oldham and has developed {{one of the largest}} and most varied permanent collections in North West England. The current collection includes over 12,000 social and industrial history items, more than 2,000 works of art, about 1,000 items <b>of</b> <b>decorative</b> art, more than 80,000 natural history specimens, over 1,000 geological specimens, about 3,000 archaeological artefacts, 15,000 photographs and a large number of books, pamphlets and documents. Meanwhile the Rifle Street drill hall dates back to 1897.|$|E
5|$|Rococo {{provided}} {{a brief but}} significant interlude in Norway, appearing primarily in the decorative arts, and mainly in interiors, furniture and luxury articles such as table silver, glass and stoneware. In some country districts folk artists produced the distinctly Norwegian craft <b>of</b> <b>decorative</b> painting, rosemaling, and related wood carving style. In polite architecture, a few wooden town houses and manors show rococo influence, notably in Trondheim and Bergen, Damsgård Manor in Bergen being the most significant.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} palace has been home to three of Strasbourg's most {{important}} museums: the Archaeological Museum (Musée archéologique, basement), the Museum <b>of</b> <b>Decorative</b> Arts (Musée des arts décoratifs, ground floor) and the Museum of Fine Arts (Musée des beaux-arts, first and second floor). The municipal art gallery, Galerie Robert Heitz, in a lateral wing of the palace, is used for temporary exhibitions. The Palais Rohan has been listed since 1920 as a Monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.|$|E

5|$|The College, {{like the}} Church of All Saints, is {{constructed}} of Kentish rag-stone in the Perpendicular style. The main building, a two-storey structure with attic, was mostly {{built in the}} 14th century and served originally as the Master's house. Some later 18th century alterations have been made and later windows added. The building contains a collar beam roof and a 16th-century staircase, moulded ceiling and aumbry cupboard.

5|$|Beckford's Tower in Lansdown {{overlooking}} {{the city of}} Bath, was completed in 1827 for wealthy local resident William Beckford, to a design by Bath architect Henry Goodridge. Beckford was an English novelist, an art collector and patron of works <b>of</b> <b>decorative</b> art, a critic, travel writer and sometime politician, reputed at one stage in his life to be the richest commoner in England. In 1822 he sold Fonthill Abbey, and {{a large part of}} his art collection, to John Farquhar for £330,000, and moved to Bath, where he bought No. 20 Lansdown Crescent and No. 1 Lansdown Place West, joining them with a one-storey arch thrown across a driveway. In 1836 he also bought Nos. 18 and 19 Lansdown Crescent.|$|E
5|$|Douglas's output {{included}} new churches, restoring and renovating existing churches, church furnishings, {{new houses}} and alterations to existing houses, {{and a variety}} of other buildings, including shops, banks, offices, schools, memorials and public buildings. His architectural styles were eclectic. Douglas worked during the period of the Gothic Revival, and many of his works incorporate elements of the English Gothic style. He was also influenced by architectural styles from the mainland of Europe and included elements of French, German and Dutch architecture. However he is probably best remembered for his incorporation of vernacular elements in his buildings, in particular half-timbering, influenced by the black-and-white revival in Chester. Other vernacular elements he incorporated include tile-hanging, pargeting, and the use <b>of</b> <b>decorative</b> brick in diapering and the design of tall chimney stacks. Of particular importance is Douglas's use of joinery and highly detailed wood carving.|$|E

5|$|FIU {{has three}} museums, the Frost Art Museum, the Wolfsonian-FIU Museum and the Jewish Museum of Florida. The Frost Art Museum {{is located on}} Modesto A. Maidique campus and was opened in 1977 as The Art Museum at Florida International University. The Frost Art Museum's Permanent Collection {{consists}} of {{a broad array of}} art objects from ancient cultural artifacts to contemporary works of art. The Wolfsonian-FIU Museum is located in Miami Beach and promotes the collection, preservation and understanding <b>of</b> <b>decorative</b> art and design from the period from 1885 to 1945. FIU also has a large sculpture collection, named the Sculpture Park at FIU, with sculptures from such prominent artists as Anthony Caro, Jacques Lipchitz, Daniel Joseph Martinez, and Tony Rosenthal. Many different art structures, statues, paintings and mosaics can be seen throughout campus in gardens, buildings, walkways, and on walls.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's works, {{especially}} his Lives of the Poets series, describe various features of excellent writing. He {{believed that the}} best poetry relied on contemporary language, and he disliked the use <b>of</b> <b>decorative</b> or purposefully archaic language. He was suspicious of the poetic language used by Milton, whose blank verse he believed would inspire many bad imitations. Also, Johnson opposed the poetic language of his contemporary Thomas Gray. His greatest complaint was that obscure allusions found in works like Milton's Lycidas were overused; he preferred poetry that could be easily read and understood. In addition to his views on language, Johnson believed that a good poem incorporated new and unique imagery.|$|E
5|$|Museum curators {{consider}} {{visitors who}} pick up {{items from the}} ground to be thieves, and local police will charge them as such. The maximum penalty is a prison sentence of ten years. On 22 June 2015, two British youths from the Perse School were convicted of theft after picking up buttons and shards <b>of</b> <b>decorative</b> glass they found on the ground near the area where camp victims' confiscated personal effects were stored. The boys, both 17 years old, received probation and were fined £170, but later appealed the sentence. Curators said that similar incidents happen {{once or twice a}} year.|$|E

5|$|Nothing survives of the {{original}} buildings, La Oriole and the smaller St Martin's Hall in the south-east; both were demolished before the quadrangle {{was built in the}} artisan mannerist style during the 17th century. The south and west ranges and the gate tower were built around 1620 to 1622; the north and east ranges and the chapel buildings date from 1637 to 1642. The façade of the east range forms a classical E shape comprising the college chapel, hall and undercroft. The exterior and interior of the ranges are topped by an alternating pattern <b>of</b> <b>decorative</b> gables. The gate house has a Perpendicular portal and canted Gothic oriel windows, with fan vaulting in the entrance. The room above has a particularly fine plaster ceiling and chimney piece of stucco caryatids and panelling interlaced with studded bands sprouting into large flowers.|$|E
5|$|Rodin's {{relationship}} with Turquet was rewarding: through him, {{he won the}} 1880 commission to create a portal for a planned museum <b>of</b> <b>decorative</b> arts. Rodin dedicated much of the next four decades to his elaborate Gates of Hell, an unfinished portal for a museum that was never built. Many of the portal's figures became sculptures in themselves, including Rodin's most famous, The Thinker and The Kiss. With the museum commission came a free studio, granting Rodin {{a new level of}} artistic freedom. Soon, he stopped working at the porcelain factory; his income came from private commissions.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{primarily}} built from bricks, with stone {{used for the}} detailing, such as doorways. The brickwork was decorated with patterns of darker bricks, called diapering, which was used to show symbols associated with Lord Hastings, as well as objects such as a jug and a ship. This style <b>of</b> <b>decorative</b> brickwork and stonework was popular across England at this time, but particularly so at Eton College, where John Cowper, the master mason on the project, had been an apprentice. Although the castle was not extensively decorated, the brickwork at Kirby Muxloe was skillfully executed, with the bricklayers cutting and shaping the kiln-fired bricks to produce spiral and domed vaulting.|$|E

5|$|The vimana {{of their}} temples (tower over the shrine) is a {{compromise}} in detail between the plain stepped {{style of the}} early Chalukyas and the decorative finish of the Hoysalas. To the credit of the Western Chalukya architects {{is the development of}} the lathe turned (tuned) pillars and use of Soapstone (Chloritic Schist) as basic building and sculptural material, a very popular idiom in later Hoysala temples. They popularised the use <b>of</b> <b>decorative</b> Kirtimukha (demon faces) in their sculptures. Famous architects in the Hoysala kingdom included Chalukyan architects who were natives of places such as Balligavi. The artistic wall decor and the general sculptural idiom was dravidian architecture. This style is sometimes called Karnata dravida, one of the notable traditions in Indian architecture.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} commemorating Corkhill's {{efforts in}} the war was erected in Tilba, and she was presented with the medal by Governor-General Lord Foster. Following the war, Corkhill went on to pursue a nursing career. After serving as a nurse in various hospitals both in Australia and overseas, Corkhill became the senior sister at the District Hospital in Bega, New South Wales in 1951. In 1975, she donated a large collection of her father's photographs to the National Library of Australia. Amongst the one thousand piece collection were personal photographs along with pictures of the Tilba area, which were later {{used to create a}} book, Taken at Tilba, and an engagement calendar. Corkhill was a skilled horsewoman, and was the lead in the centenary Cooma Show. A supper cloth made by Corkhill while on duty has been used as an example <b>of</b> <b>decorative</b> crafts of the era, and a number of photographs she had taken while on duty were donated to the Australian War Memorial. Corkhill died on 4 December 1985 in Dalmeny, New South Wales. She was unmarried.|$|E
5|$|A similar, strong {{competition}} was established very probably between Gasparo Cairano and Antonio della Porta (Tamagnino), who debuted in Brescia (in documentary terms) along with Cairano with his cycle of twelve Angels {{for the first}} dome of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, between 24 December 1489 and May 3, 1490. It {{is not clear what}} brought this Milanese artist to Brescia. He belonged to a family of sculptors, and between 1484 and 1489 was known to have worked in Milan and Pavia for the Sforza, in close contact with Giovanni Antonio Amadeo. His debut as a figurative sculptor at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, however, owed to the Sanmicheli, who typically specialized in the field <b>of</b> <b>decorative</b> sculpture and lacked outside of this field. Note that Gasparo Cairano himself also first appeared on the art scene as a figurative sculptor under the Sanmicheli: he created his sequence of twelve Apostles at the same project.|$|E
