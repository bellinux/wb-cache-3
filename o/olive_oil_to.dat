25|$|All Roman cities had {{at least}} one Thermae, a popular {{facility}} for public bathing, exercising and socializing. Exercise might include wrestling and weight-lifting, as well as swimming. Bathing was {{an important part of the}} Roman day, where some hours might be spent, at a very low cost subsidized by the government. Wealthier Romans were often accompanied by one or more slaves, who performed any required tasks such as fetching refreshment, guarding valuables, providing towels, and at the end of the session, applying <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> their masters' bodies which was then scraped off with a strigil, a scraper made of wood or bone. Romans did not wash with soap and water as we do now.|$|E
25|$|The Carthaginians were rivals to the Greeks and Romans. Carthage {{fought the}} Punic Wars, three wars with Rome: the First Punic War (264 to 241 BC), over Sicily; the Second Punic War (218 to 201 BC), in which Hannibal invaded Europe; and the Third Punic War (149 to 146 BC). Carthage lost {{the first two}} wars, and in the third it was destroyed, {{becoming}} the Roman province of Africa, with the Berber Kingdom of Numidia assisting Rome. The Roman province of Africa became a major agricultural supplier of wheat, olives, and <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> imperial Rome via exorbitant taxation. Two centuries later, Rome brought the Berber kingdoms of Numidia and Mauretania under its authority. In the 420's AD, Vandals invaded North Africa and Rome lost her territories. The Berber kingdoms subsequently regained their independence.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to find if there is direct evidence relating the fatty acid composition of <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> <b>to</b> specific cultivars grown within a well-limited geographical region. <b>To</b> group <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> according <b>to</b> their own cultivars, 13 C high-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography (GC) were used to analyze 60 extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> from the same Italian region (southwestern Sicily) obtained from four monovarietal cultivars. The 13 C NMR spectrum provides information about glycerol triesters of <b>olive</b> <b>oils,</b> i. e., about the acyl composition of major components and about the fatty acids’ positional distribution on the glycerol moiety. GC gives the complete fatty acid profile of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> samples. Selection of NMR and GC peaks {{on the basis of their}} sensitivity to the different cultivars was performed by using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Principal component analysis, tree clustering analysis, multidimensional scaling (MDS), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were then performed on the MANOVA-selected peaks. Results obtained from 13 C NMR and GC techniques combined with the multivariate statistical procedure are in good agreement and prove the usefulness of fatty acids analysis to group the monovarietal <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> belonging <b>to</b> the same cultivars.

40|$|Despite a {{rapid growth}} in <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> {{consumption}} in recent few years, the culinary use of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> is still relatively new to UK consumers, and is still regarded {{as a set of}} particular attributes rather than as an everyday cooking <b>oil.</b> <b>To</b> increase sales and attract new users, <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> needs <b>to</b> be seen by UK consumers as an 'everyday' cooking oil, and enter into direct competition with standard vegetable <b>oils.</b> <b>To</b> achieve this, we argue in this paper that standard <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> needs <b>to</b> be repositioned and distanced from extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> in order <b>to</b> give customers sufficient cues to revise their opinions and consumption strategies.
