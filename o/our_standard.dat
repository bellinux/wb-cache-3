The Vilna Gaon's emendations were often based on his quest for internal consistency in the text rather than on manuscript evidence; nevertheless many of the Gaon's emendations were later verified by textual critics, such as Solomon Schechter, who had Cairo Genizah texts with which to compare <b>our</b> <b>standard</b> editions.|$|E
500|$|The 1920s were {{a time of}} {{modernization}} for America. Use of electricity became increasingly common. Mass production of the motor car stimulated other industries, as well, such as highway construction, rubber, steel, and building, as hotels were erected to accommodate the tourists venturing upon the roads. This economic boost helped bring the nation out of the recession. To improve and expand the nation's highway system, Harding signed the Federal Highway Act of 1921. From 1921 to 1923, the federal government spent $162million on America's highway system, infusing the U.S. economy with {{a large amount of}} capital. In 1922, Harding proclaimed that America was {{in the age of the}} [...] "motor car", which [...] "reflects <b>our</b> <b>standard</b> of living and gauges the speed of our present-day life." ...|$|E
500|$|Later in February, Specter accused Sestak of mistreating his {{employees}} and disobeying {{state and federal}} minimum wage laws by severely underpaying his House staff. Citing Federal Election Commission reports, Specter claimed ten of Sestak's sixteen campaign staffers were making less than minimum wage {{and that they were}} so underpaid they were eligible for food stamps. He also noted that Sestak's three highest-paid staffers were members of his family, including his brother Richard Sestak, who worked as campaign manager. T.J. Rooney, a Specter supporter, wrote a letter to Sestak expressing concern about the potential violation of minimum wage laws, which read: [...] "It is inconceivable to me that <b>our</b> <b>standard</b> bearer wouldn’t be paying his workers the minimum wage". Sestak responded by acknowledging his staff could make more money elsewhere, but said [...] "they choose to work hard and make some sacrifices because they know {{how important it is to}} elect someone to the United States Senate who shares their principles".|$|E

I will show that transcendental arguments present a solution to this problem by presenting a transcendental argument and examining the conditional necessities on which it is based. Then the nature of conditional necessities themselves will be examined and it will be shown how <b>our</b> <b>standards</b> of rationality are justified. As a result, the need for transcendental arguments will have been established and skepticism regarding these standards will have been countered...|$|R

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series {{consulting}} producer Gary Janetti as his second episode of the season, and directed by series regular Dominic Bianchi, also in his second episode of the season. In an interview with Forbes, series producer Kara Vallow revealed that the plot was inspired by an episode of the CBS sitcom All in the Family entitled [...] "Archie in the Cellar," [...] in which Archie Bunker is locked in a cellar, breaking from the show's usual storyline. [...] Vallow and Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane were fans of All in the Family during its original airing {{and came up with}} the original concept for the episode. Vallow went on to state that the episode [...] " [...] like a one-act stage play in a way," [...] because it [...] " [...] rely on <b>our</b> <b>standard</b> cutaways and gags." [...] In a first for the series, the only voice actor to perform in the episode was series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, who portrays both characters. In addition, neither composer Ron Jones nor composer Walter Murphy contributed any background music to the episode whatsoever. The writer of the episode, Gary Janetti, wrote the episode based on a loose script written by MacFarlane, as well as various phone conversations about the structure of the storyline, and the various acts.|$|E
