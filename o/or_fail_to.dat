5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report the gender of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further {{compounded by the fact that}} the majority of animal studies also exclude females <b>or</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> account for differences in sex and gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E

25|$|No {{controlled}} {{clinical trials}} {{have been conducted}} on ADEM treatment, but aggressive treatment aimed at rapidly reducing inflammation of the CNS is standard. The widely accepted first-line treatment is high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone, followed by 3–6 weeks of gradually lower oral doses of prednisolone. Patients treated with methylprednisolone have shown better outcomes than those treated with dexamethasone. Oral tapers of {{less than three weeks}} duration show a higher chance of relapsing, and tend to show poorer outcomes. Other anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies have been reported to show beneficial effect, such as plasmapheresis, high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide.

25|$|Since {{registration}} for the Gypsy Horse has only existed {{within the last}} 20 years, most associations require a genetic analysis for registration, to verify identity and identify future offspring. All of the North American Gypsy Horse and Drum Horse societies employ the Animal Genetics Research Laboratory of the University of Kentucky to perform DNA analysis and maintain a database of registered horses' DNA markers. UKY currently tests markers at 17 loci of a horse's genetic makeup. The aim of this analysis is to either exclude <b>or</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> exclude another horse as a parent. In a spirit of co-operation, five American breed societies have jointly granted the University of Kentucky permission to employ DNA markers in confirming parentage. Since information regarding the past histories, including parentage, {{of many of the}} Gypsy Horses imported to North America was lost, many owners seek to reclaim the genetic roots of their animals, and services have sprung up to satisfy this desire.|$|E
25|$|By law, all Saudi {{citizens}} who are infected with HIV or AIDS are entitled to free medical care, protection of their privacy and employment opportunities. The government has produced educational material on how the disease is spread and since the 1980s Abdullah al-Hokail, a Saudi doctor who specializes in the pandemic, {{has been allowed to}} air public service announcements on television about the disease and how it is spread. Yet, ignorance, fear and prejudice are often directed at people living with the disease. While the government has designated several hospitals to treat those people infected with AIDS or HIV, other hospitals often refuse to care for such people <b>or</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> treat them in a compassionate and humane manner. Hospitals and schools are often reluctant to distribute government information about the disease because of strong taboos and the stigma attached to how the virus can be spread. For example, condoms are legal, but until recently, they were rarely available anywhere other than certain hospitals or medical supply stores.|$|E
25|$|To {{prepare for}} an assay, the {{researcher}} fills each {{well of the}} plate with some biological entity that they wish to conduct the experiment upon, such as a protein, cells, or an animal embryo. After some incubation time has passed to allow the biological matter to absorb, bind to, or otherwise react (<b>or</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> react) with the compounds in the wells, measurements are taken across all the plate's wells, either manually or by a machine. Manual measurements are often necessary when the researcher is using microscopy to (for example) seek changes or defects in embryonic development caused by the wells' compounds, looking for effects that a computer could not easily determine by itself. Otherwise, a specialized automated analysis machine can run a number of experiments on the wells (such as shining polarized light on them and measuring reflectivity, which can be an indication of protein binding). In this case, the machine outputs the result of each experiment as a grid of numeric values, with each number mapping to the value obtained from a single well. A high-capacity analysis machine can measure dozens of plates {{in the space of}} a few minutes like this, generating thousands of experimental datapoints very quickly.|$|E

25|$|The main single player {{portion of}} TimeSplitters 2 {{is divided into}} ten levels. Each level is in a {{different}} time period and contains a series of objectives that must be completed. Some objectives are present {{at the start of}} the level, while others are added during play. A few levels have secondary objectives, which are not required to complete unless on the normal or hard difficulty setting. Each level includes a single checkpoint in the middle where the player can restart if they die <b>or</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> complete an objective (with the exception of the last level on any difficulty and the fourth level on easy). For each level, the player must choose from three difficulty levels. These difficulty levels not only change the strength of the enemies, but also increase the length of the level by adding additional objectives; for instance, in both easy and normal levels, there are optional secondary objectives, whereas in the hard levels, all secondary objectives are now primary and must be completed. At the end of every level, a time crystal must be recovered. After it is picked up, a time portal will appear which must be entered in order to complete the level. However, this is sometimes made more difficult by TimeSplitters that teleport to the player's location. In secret places of certain levels, there are cartridges of old school arcade games such as Snake, that can be picked up and played on the player's Temporal Uplink, the device that normally shows the map of the current level.|$|E
500|$|In a {{response}} to the 2005-2006 India National Family Health Survey III, 31 percent of all women reported having been the victims of physical violence in the 12 months preceding the survey. However, the actual number of victims may be much higher. [...] Women who are victimised by domestic violence may underreport <b>or</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> report instances. This may be due to a sense of shame or embarrassment stemming from cultural norms associated with women being subservient to their husbands. [...] Furthermore, underreporting by women may occur in order to protect family honour.|$|E
500|$|Traditional Chinese {{literary}} criticism emphasized {{the life of}} the author when interpreting a work, a practice which Burton Watson attributes to [...] "the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between art and morality". Since many of Du Fu's poems feature morality and history, this practice is particularly important. Another reason, identified by the Chinese historian William Hung, is that Chinese poems are typically concise, omitting context that might be relevant, but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know. For modern Western readers, [...] "The less accurately we know the time, the place and the circumstances in the background, the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly, and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem <b>or</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> understand it altogether". [...] Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu, arguing that the variety of the poet's work required consideration of his whole life, rather than the [...] "reductive" [...] categorizations used for more limited poets.|$|E

500|$|In the single-player mode, the game's main [...] {{sees the}} player {{take on the}} part of a Terran pilot, in which they engage in a series of {{missions}} that become increasingly challenging and sophisticated overtime the more the progress into the campaign; the difficulty level of the campaign can be changed at any time, in between missions. To ease players into the various controls of the game, training missions are included in the campaign, mixed in between regular missions, that gradually introduce the player to advanced commands and techniques. Completing a mission and subsequently unlocking the next one, requires meeting a number of objective defined for it, although not all need to be completed to end the mission successfully; some are scripted to be failed as part of the campaign's story. If a player dies on a mission, <b>or</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> complete vital objectives (i.e. protecting an important ship), players can restart a mission and try it again. In missions, players receive directives tied to their missions, such as destroying a target, protecting an asset, or another task (i.e. inspecting something), which turn blue for completion, red for being failed; multiple targets of a directive (such as destroying an enemy wing) include a number in brackets that decreases as targets are destroyed or depart.|$|E

Through them, the Doctor is led to the living head of Dorium Maldovar, one of the Doctor's allies taken by the Order of the Headless Monks ("A Good Man Goes to War").
