After a substantial <b>overhaul,</b> <b>the</b> Duchess was declared fit in 1990 to continue working on the national network {{and at the same}} time the museum purchased it outright from Butlins. In 1998, however, {{the locomotive}} returned to static display at the National Railway Museum in York.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) {{finalized}} {{plans to}} <b>overhaul</b> <b>the</b> station completely. In 1999, the MTA requested $125 {{million in federal}} funding for the renovation. As part of renovation, a group of satellite dishes was proposed for the station. By this point, the New York City Transit Police were operating from a tent adjacent to the station, and there were vestiges of a carousel within the station.|$|E
5|$|The {{line has}} six steam {{locomotives}} for passenger trains and four diesel locomotives, which are primarily used for shunting and to haul works trains. It is unusual for all steam locomotives to be operable {{at the same}} time, as at least one is normally scheduled for <b>overhaul.</b> <b>The</b> railway also owns 23carriages and vans, including all of the original carriages and the brake van built for the railway.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} {{important}} for transport along the coast until 1944, when {{the completion of the}} Sørland Line made Flekkefjord a branch station. At the same time, the line was converted to standard gauge, the number of station tracks was reduced, and the station received an <b>overhaul.</b> <b>The</b> station building was demolished in 1970, but the station was still served until the line closed in 1990. The tracks and depot buildings still exist.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Siboney was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration and {{assigned}} to the War Department as a U.S. Army transport. She made several transatlantic trips and called at ports in Africa, the Middle East, Canada, the Caribbean, and the United Kingdom. During a 1944 <b>overhaul,</b> <b>the</b> ship was selected for conversion to a hospital ship. Renamed USAHS Charles A. Stafford after a U.S. Army doctor killed in action in Australia, the ship served in both the European and the Pacific Theatres. After {{the end of her}} army service, the ship was laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet in February 1948, and sold for scrapping in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower favored Shoup {{because he}} feared other {{officers}} {{spent too much}} time in political affairs, and felt Shoup would reduce the influence of the military industrial complex. Immediately after his appointment, Shoup sought to place new officers in key positions, in an attempt to <b>overhaul</b> <b>the</b> leadership of the Marine Corps. He and Pate disagreed over some of the new appointments, as Shoup transferred many senior officers and encouraged others to retire. Shoup later wrote he felt the Joint Chiefs of Staff had an undue weight in the direction of military strategy. He also sought to curtail politicking by lower-level Marine officers seeking career advancement.|$|E

5|$|Elected {{officials}} on Staten Island such as Diane Savino have been demanding {{the replacement of}} the Staten Island Railway's aging R44 train cars. Initially, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority planned to order R179s for the Staten Island Railway, but later decided to overhaul some R46s to replace the existing R44s there. However, the plan to <b>overhaul</b> <b>the</b> R46s for the Staten Island Railway was also dropped, and 75 future R211S cars are planned to replace the Staten Island Railway's fleet of R44s instead. Until then, the R44s are undergoing another round of scheduled maintenance to extend their usefulness until at least 2023.|$|E
5|$|In April 1958, Eisenhower asked Congress for {{legislation}} to <b>overhaul</b> <b>the</b> Department of Defense. Over a decade {{had passed since}} the legislation which had established it, and {{he was concerned about}} the degree of inter-service rivalry, duplication and mismanagement that was evident in many programs. In ballistic missile development, the Soviet Sputnik program had demonstrated that country's technological lead over the United States. The Army and Air Force had rival programs, PGM-19 Jupiter and PGM-17 Thor respectively, and the additional cost to the taxpayers of developing two systems instead of one was estimated at $500million.|$|E
5|$|Indiana {{returned}} to Puget Sound naval yard for a needed <b>overhaul.</b> <b>The</b> work lasted until January 1945; the ship {{returned to}} active duty on the 24th of that month. Indiana {{took part in the}} bombardment of Iwo Jima, as well as in attacks on the Japanese home islands. Following the shore bombardments, Indiana joined the task force that had assembled to invade Okinawa; the ship provided ground support fire as well as anti-aircraft defense against the increasing number of Kamikazes that were attacking the invasion fleet. Indiana continued in these duties {{until the end of the}} war in August 1945.|$|E

5|$|Arkansas {{participated in}} the FLEX 2 at Culebra in January 1936, and then visited New Orleans, during Mardi Gras. She went to Norfolk for a major {{overhaul}} that lasted through the spring of 1936. After completing the <b>overhaul,</b> <b>the</b> ship took another midshipmen crew to European waters; she called in the ports of Portsmouth, England, Gothenburg, Sweden, and Cherbourg, and returned to Annapolis, in August. As in the previous year, she conducted another Reserve training cruise, and then went into drydock for an overhaul in Norfolk. The remainder of the 1930s followed a similar pattern; in 1937, the midshipmen training cruise went to Europe, but the 1938 and 1939 cruises remained in the western Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Gannon became {{manager of}} Stockport County, {{now in the}} National League North, {{for the third time}} in his career on 18 January 2016. Gannon started off well, taking the team to the Cheshire Senior Cup final and up to ninth in the table with a {{sequence}} of seven games unbeaten, including five victories, in the run up to Easter. County finished eighth in the 2016–17 season, one point outside the play-offs. Gannon was credited with turning around the career of Danny Lloyd, who signed for Peterborough United in May 2017, 12 months after Gannon had persuaded him to play for County rather than quit the game altogether. Gannon said that he was pleased with his defence, but wanted to <b>overhaul</b> <b>the</b> attacking side so as to reach the play-offs the following season.|$|E

5|$|Gellibrand {{was sent}} to the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom as Brigadier General, General Staff (BGGS) to Major General James Whiteside McCay. McCay was known as a hard task master, but he had nothing but praise for the work of Gellibrand, who helped him <b>overhaul</b> <b>the</b> {{organisation}} and the training syllabus. Likewise, Gellibrand held McCay in high regard. Gellibrand returned to the Western Front on 14 November 1917, taking over command of the 12th Infantry Brigade vice Brigadier General James Campbell Robertson, who was returning to Australia on leave. He soon placed his own distinctive stamp on his new command. In April 1918, the brigade was committed to battle {{in the path of the}} advancing German Army in the Battle of Dernancourt. The brigade held and defeated the German advance.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{had planned}} to {{introduce}} legislation to place a one-year moratorium on new Colorado health insurance mandates with independent Rep. Kathleen Curry, {{as part of a}} proposal to <b>overhaul</b> <b>the</b> states insurance mandate commission. However, they announced {{at the start of the}} session that their proposal would not include an immediate moratorium on insurance mandates, and the legislation was killed on its first hearing in a House committee. Roberts also withdrew one of her proposals to continue a pilot program for training of Certified Nursing Assistants, on account of its cost. Roberts also sponsored a contentious piece of legislation with general election opponent Sen. Bruce Whitehead, negotiated by Governor Ritter's office, to require utilities to convert some Front Range coal-fired power plants to natural gas.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{leadership}} {{expected to}} reach these targets with economic aid from the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) and loans from international agencies of the capitalist world. The 4th National Congress {{made it clear that}} agriculture would be socialised; however, during the Second Five-Year Plan the socialisation measures went so badly that Võ Chí Công, a Politburo member and Chairman of the Committee for the Socialist Transformation of Agriculture, claimed {{it would be impossible to}} meet the targets set by the plan by 1980. An estimated 10,000 out of 13,246 socialist cooperatives, established during the plan, had collapsed in the South by 1980. Politburo member Lê Thanh Nghị attacked lower-level cadres for the failure of the socialist agriculture transformation. The collectivisation process led to an abrupt drop in food production in 1977 and 1978, leading the 6th Plenum of the Central Committee to completely <b>overhaul</b> <b>the</b> Party's agricultural policies.|$|E
