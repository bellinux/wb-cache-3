In this paper, we reviewed our recent work on development of <b>composite</b> <b>catalysts,</b> mainly focusing on the <b>composite</b> <b>catalysts</b> obtained from porous materials such as zeolites, mesoporous materials, carbon nanotubes (CNT), etc. Six types of porous <b>composite</b> <b>catalysts</b> are discussed, including amorphous oxide modified zeolite <b>composite</b> <b>catalysts,</b> zeolite <b>composites</b> prepared by co-crystallization or overgrowth, hierarchical porous <b>catalysts,</b> host-guest porous <b>composites,</b> inorganic and organic mesoporous <b>composite</b> <b>catalysts,</b> and polymer/CNT <b>composite</b> <b>catalysts...</b>|$|R

These conventional filter systems operate with a large excess of NO 2 so that they work even under adverse operating conditions properly. However, it is worth mentioning that new regulated CRT filter systems with the so-called NOxOPT technique[17] reduce the excess NO 2 by 75 % and, thus also, the direct NO 2 emissions.|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} on a diesel engine operating on Euro V diesel fuel, pure biodiesel and biodiesel blended with ethanol (BE blends) to assess the particulate and unregulated emissions with and without diesel <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst</b> (DOC). The results indicate an increase of particle number concentration, formaldehyde emission and acetaldehyde emission while a decrease of particulate mass concentration, when the diesel engine is operated with biodiesel, compared with the diesel fuel. Adding ethanol in biodiesel can help to control particulate emissions, especially particle number concentration. However, the unregulated emissions, such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and unburned ethanol are worsened with BE blended fuels. The diesel <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst</b> (DOC) can effectively reduce particulate mass concentration, particle number concentration and unregulated emissions for all different fuels, while the conversion efficiency of DOC is different for each fuel. The <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst</b> is not equally active for different hydrocarbon species.

40|$|The {{project is}} focused on the {{development}} of an energy efficient aftertreatment system capable of reducing NOx and methane by 90 % from lean-burn natural gas engines by applying active exhaust flow control. Compared to conventional passive flow-through reactors, the proposed scheme cuts supplemental energy by 50 %- 70 %. The system consists of a Lean NOx Trap (LNT) system and an <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst.</b> Through alternating flow control, a major amount of engine exhaust flows through {{a large portion of the}} LNT system in the absorption mode, while a small amount of exhaust goes through a small portion of the LNT system in the regeneration or desulfurization mode.

40|$|This {{final report}} {{describes}} the objectives, technical approach, results and conclusions {{for a project}} funded by the U. S. Department of Energy to test a hybrid sulfur recovery process for natural gas upgrading. The process concept is a configuration of CrystaTech, Inc. 's CrystaSulf{reg_sign} process which utilizes a direct <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst</b> upstream of the absorber tower to oxidize {{a portion of the}} inlet hydrogen sulfide (H{sub 2 }S) to sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2 }) and elemental sulfur. This hybrid configuration of CrystaSulf has been named CrystaSulf-DO and represents a low-cost option for direct treatment of natural gas streams to remove H{sub 2 }S in quantities equivalent to 0. 2 - 25 metric tons (LT) of sulfur per day and more. This hybrid process is projected to have lower capital and operating costs than the competing technologies, amine/aqueous iron liquid redox and amine/Claus/tail gas treating, and have a smaller plant footprint, making it well suited to both onshore and offshore applications. CrystaSulf is a nonaqueous sulfur recovery process that removes H{sub 2 }S from gas streams and converts it to elemental sulfur. In CrystaSulf, H{sub 2 }S in the inlet gas is reacted with SO{sub 2 } to make elemental sulfur according to the liquid phase Claus reaction: 2 H{sub 2 }S + SO{sub 2 } {yields} 2 H{sub 2 }O + 3 S. The SO{sub 2 } for the reaction can be supplied from external sources by purchasing liquid SO{sub 2 } and injecting it into the CrystaSulf solution, or produced internally by converting a portion of the inlet gas H{sub 2 }S to SO{sub 2 } or by burning a portion of the sulfur produced to make SO{sub 2 }. CrystaSulf features high sulfur recovery similar to aqueous-iron liquid redox sulfur recovery processes, but differs from the aqueous processes in that CrystaSulf controls the location where elemental sulfur particles are formed. In the hybrid process, the needed SO{sub 2 } is produced by placing a bed of direct <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst</b> in the inlet gas stream to oxidize a portion of the inlet H{sub 2 }S. <b>Oxidation</b> <b>catalysts</b> may also produce some elemental sulfur under these conditions, which can be removed and recovered prior to the CrystaSulf absorber. The CrystaSulf-DO process can utilize direct <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst</b> from many sources. Numerous direct <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalysts</b> are available from many suppliers worldwide. They have been used for H{sub 2 }S oxidation to sulfur and/or SO{sub 2 } for decades. It was believed {{at the outset of the}} project that TDA Research, Inc., a subcontractor, could develop a direct <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst</b> that would offer advantages over other commercially available catalysts for this CrystaSulf-DO process application. This project involved the development of several of TDA's candidate proprietary direct <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalysts</b> through laboratory bench-scale testing. These catalysts were shown to be effective for conversion of H{sub 2 }S to SO{sub 2 } and to elemental sulfur under certain operating conditions. One of these catalysts was subsequently tested on a commercial gas stream in a bench-scale reactor at CrystaTech's pilot plant site in west Texas with good results. However, commercial developments have precluded the use of TDA catalysts in the CrystaSulf-DO process. Nonetheless, this project has advanced direct <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst</b> technology for H{sub 2 }S control in energy industries and led to several viable paths to commercialization. TDA is commercializing the use of its direct <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst</b> technology in conjunction with the SulfaTreat{reg_sign} solid scavenger for natural gas applications and in conjunction with ConocoPhillips and DOE for gasification applications using ConocoPhillips gasification technology.

Latest technologies have been developed in the automotive exhaust system to acknowledge the emission norms. Diesel <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst</b> and Muffler both are playing major roles in reducing emission and noise level as well. Diesel <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst</b> reduces CO and unburned HC emissions. Muffler reduces noise level of exhaust gases. Nowadays automobile industry is using CFD software extensively to analyze the flow properties inside the diesel <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst</b> and Muffler.

40|$|How a {{chemical}} reaction engineer would approach {{the challenge of}} designing a CO <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst</b> for pulsed CO 2 lasers is described. CO <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalysts</b> {{have a long history}} of application, of course, so it is instructive to first consider the special requirements of the laser application and then to compare them to the characteristics of existing processes which utilize CO <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalysts.</b> All CO 2 laser applications require a CO <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst</b> with the following characteristics: (1) active at stoichiometric ratios of O 2 and CO, (2) no inhibition by CO 2 or other components of the laser environment, (3) releases no particulates during vibration or thermal cycling, and (4) long lifetime with a stable activity. In all applications, low consumption of power is desirable, a characteristic especially critical in aerospace applications and, thus, catalyst activity at low temperatures is highly desirable. High power lasers with high pulse repetition rates inherently require circulation of the gas mixture and this forced circulation is available for moving gas past the catalyst. Low repetition rate lasers, however, do not inherently require gas circulation, so a catalyst that did not require such circulation would be favorable from the standpoint of minimum power consumption. Lasers designed for atmospheric penetration of their infrared radiation utilize CO 2 formed from rare isotopes of oxygen and this application has the additional constraint that normal abundance oxygen isotopes in the catalyst must not exchange with rare isotopes in the gas mixture...|$|R
