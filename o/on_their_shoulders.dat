5|$|The two lions have a male mane, {{patterned}} with dense, short lines; the manes continue beneath the body. Distinctly patterned tufts of hair grow from the lion's ears and <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders,</b> emanating from a central disk-shaped whorl. They lie prone, their heads are sculpted with attention to detail, {{but with a}} degree of artistic liberty in their form, e.g., regarding their rounded shapes. Both lions look towards the viewer, and both have their mouths closed.|$|E
5|$|The {{first six}} seasons {{featured}} sixteen fighters, in either {{one or two}} weight categories. The first two seasons, however, were very different from each following season. The original format for The Ultimate Fighter saw each team compete in challenges, such as hoisting their respective coach up <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> and sprinting down a beach, or a team tug-of-war. These challenges resulted in eliminations of fighters who hadn't fought, {{until late in the}} season when the challenge incentive was to select the next fight where fighters would be eliminated, having lost the fight. In the first two seasons, fighters would also leave the house for good upon losing and this often resulted in odd numbers for teams, which forced the moving of fighters to opposing teams.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2007, the brigade was mobilized to Fort Dix for {{training}} along with the 72nd Field Artillery Brigade from April until September. Soldiers of the 174th Infantry Brigade trained other units in land navigation, area security, urban operations, marksmanship, and live fire exercises. Most of the soldiers being trained {{were members of the}} Army National Guard. The brigade received distinctive unit insignia and shoulder sleeve insignia in September 2007. These items contained allusions to the brigade's honors during World War I and II, and its history with the 78th Infantry Division. However, as it is subordinate to the First Army, soldiers of the brigade wear that patch <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> instead. Later that month, the brigade was again mobilized to Fort Bragg, North Carolina for another training mission.|$|E

5|$|Looking {{to improve}} their on-field product, and also to find a player with talent and star power to better compete with the Jets for New York fans' affections, the Giants {{acquired}} quarterback Fran Tarkenton from the Minnesota Vikings before the 1967 season and showed improvement. They finished 7–7 in both the 1967 and 1968 seasons. In those seasons, one of Tarkenton's favorite targets, wide receiver Homer Jones made the Pro Bowl by amassing over 2,200 yards and 21 touchdowns. The team also upset the division champion Dallas Cowboys 27–21 {{in one of their}} biggest wins in years, and the Giants' jubilant players carried Sherman off the field <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders.</b> After the game, Wellington Mara said he expected Sherman to remain the team's coach for several more seasons, however, after starting 7–3 they lost their final four games.|$|E
5|$|The true {{origin of}} the rhyme is unknown, but there are several theories. Complicated metaphors are often said to exist within the lyrics, as is common with nursery rhyme exegesis. Most {{explanations}} post-date the first publication of the rhyme and have no corroborating evidence. These include the suggestion by S. Baring-Gould in the 19th century that the events were {{a version of the}} story told in the 13th-century Prose Edda Gylfaginning written by Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson. Baring-Gould stated that Hjúki and Bil, brother and sister respectively in Norse mythology, were taken up from the earth by the moon (personified as the god Máni) as they were fetching water from the well called Byrgir, bearing <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> the cask called Saegr and the pole called Simul. Around 1835, John Bellenden Ker suggested that Jack and Jill were two priests; this was enlarged by Katherine Elwes in 1930 to indicate that Jack represented Cardinal Wolsey (c.1471–1530) and Jill was Bishop Tarbes, who negotiated the marriage of Mary Tudor to the French king in 1514.|$|E
5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam are bipedal Pokémon {{characterized}} by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox-like appearance. They {{look like they}} are wearing armor, as they have two pauldron-shaped pieces <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> and a fauld-like piece around their chest. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam have three fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot, with two toes in the front on either side {{and one in the}} back near the ankle. Abra and Kadabra also have thick tails the same gold color as the rest of its body, except for a brown band located near the top. Kadabra and Alakazam have relatively large mustaches, which are shorter in female species. Kadabra has a red star-shaped symbol on its forehead, and three red wavy lines on its fauld-like torso. After evolving into Alakazam, the creatures no longer have the Zener markings and tails, while their heads become much larger, resulting in extremely powerful mental powers. Alakazam undergoes slight changes upon Mega Evolving into Mega Alakazam, as its overall color scheme becomes slightly paler, it gains a white beard alongside its now white mustache, a considerably thinner torso, and a red gem-like organ on its forehead.|$|E

At {{the end of the}} match, Kanu joined the rest of the Arsenal side in hoisting the retired Dutchman <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> as fans gave him a standing ovation. He remains a popular figure at Arsenal, being applauded when he appears at the Emirates Stadium.|$|E
25|$|A {{great effort}} {{would have been}} needed by the England batsmen {{to put them in}} a {{position}} beyond defeat, and Milton and Bailey went to the wicket with a load <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Benaud at once set a very aggressive field, especially to Bailey, where he fielded only three yards from the bat to Meckiff's bowling, a little deeper for Davidson. Bailey had a word with Benaud, no doubt asking him not to move when the bowler was running up to bowl. I thought he was so close that if Bailey had put his bat out to swing at a ball he would have hit him.|$|E

25|$|The butler’s mosaic {{dating from}} the middle of the 3rd century CE {{features}} a drinking scene. Two characters are serving two others, who are much smaller, from amphoras <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders.</b> The two amphoras bear the letters PIE (“Drink!” in Ancient Greek) and ZHCHC (“You will live” in Ancient Greek). The amphora bearers are flanked by another two characters, one of whom is carrying another amphora, the other of whom is carrying a branch of laurel and a basket of roses. This depiction is a greeting to all guests and a promise of hospitality. The same is true of another mosaic held at the museum which bears the phrase Omnia tibi felicia (May everything please you).|$|E
25|$|The {{company was}} marching from Melville Barracks to the Royal Naval Barracks, Chatham, {{to attend a}} boxing tournament. It was divided into three platoons; the rear platoon {{consisted}} of new recruits {{who had not yet}} received uniforms. They were generally under the command of cadet non-commissioned officers (NCOs); the only adult present was the contingent adjutant, Lieutenant Clarence Murrayfield Carter, a regular Royal Marines officer. The column was about fifteen yards long and was marching three abreast on the left-hand side of the road. It was showing no lights, there being no official requirement to do so, and the boys in uniform were wearing Royal Marines standard-issue dark blue battledress and berets, although they had white belts and white lanyards <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders.</b>|$|E
25|$|Duke Ellington, B.B. King, and Dizzy Gillespie {{all made}} trips to Africa that fostered {{connections}} with the African diaspora. In 1956, Dizzy Gillespie took on the role as a musical ambassador during his trip to the Middle East. He reported to President Eisenhower {{that he and his}} jazz band were effective against Red propaganda. With their interracial group, the jazz band was able to communicate across social and language barriers. During the band's trip to Athens, Greece, a performance transformed an audience of Anti-American students angered by the U.S. stance on Greece's right-wing dictatorship. By the end of the performance, Gillespie said the audience loved the music and threw him up <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> after the performance. Diplomats emphasized the positive effects of musical diplomacy on the public.|$|E
25|$|This {{is a rare}} form of synesthesia where {{individuals}} {{feel the}} same sensation that another person feels (such as touch). For instance, when such a synesthete observes someone being tapped <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulder,</b> the synesthete involuntarily feels a tap <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own <b>shoulder</b> as well. People {{with this type of}} synesthesia have been shown to have higher empathy levels compared to the general population. This {{may be related to the}} so-called mirror neurons present in the motor areas of the brain, which have also been linked to empathy.|$|R

25|$|Every legion {{had a large}} baggage train, which {{included}} 640 mules (1 mule for every 8 legionaries) just for the soldiers' equipment. To keep these baggage trains from becoming too large and slow, Marius had each infantryman carry as much of his own equipment as he could, including his own armour, weapons and 15 days' rations, for about 25–30kg (50–60 pounds) of load total. To make this easier, he issued each legionary a cross stick to carry their loads <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders.</b> The soldiers were nicknamed Marius' Mules because {{of the amount of}} gear they had to carry themselves. This arrangement allowed for the possibility for the supply train to become temporarily detached from {{the main body of the}} legion, thus greatly increasing the army's speed when needed.|$|E
25|$|The {{heart the}} city, around the Île de la Cité, was {{a maze of}} narrow, winding streets and {{crumbling}} buildings from earlier centuries; it was picturesque, but dark, crowded, unhealthy and dangerous. Water was distributed by porters carrying buckets from a pole <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and the sewers emptied directly into the Seine. A cholera outbreak in 1832 killed twenty thousand people. The Comte de Rambuteau, the Prefect of the Seine for fifteen years under Louis-Philippe, made tentative {{efforts to improve the}} center of the city: he paved the quays of the Seine with stone paths and planted trees along the river. He built a new street (now the Rue Rambuteau) to connect the Le Marais district with the markets and began construction of Les Halles, the famous central market of Paris, which was finished by Napoleon III.|$|E
25|$|Despite his age, Moore again {{played for}} the state when George Parr's team toured Australia during the 1863–64 season, opening the bowling with Nat Thomson. With New South Wales fielding 18 players, the match was not accorded {{first-class}} status, although Moore took four wickets in the English team's first innings. Moore did not make his first-class debut until March 1870, when {{at the age of}} 50 years and 325 days he played against Victoria in an intercolonial match at the Albert Ground, Sydney. Coming in last in the batting order, he scored eight not out in a 33-run partnership with Charles Bannerman (also on debut), which enabled New South Wales to reach 200 runs {{for the first time in}} intercolonial matches. This achievement so excited their teammates that they were carried off the ground <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Moore went on to play two further first-class matches, both against Victoria, with his best bowling figures, 6/56, coming during the 1871–72 season, in a match New South Wales lost by an innings and 26 runs. In recognition of his performance at the match, he was presented with the match ball mounted on a silver stand.|$|E
