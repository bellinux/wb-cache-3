5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences the risk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by {{a family history of}} alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E

By May that year, construction had not yet began nor had a new contractor been found.|$|E
5|$|Among Imperial {{historian}}s {{who wrote in}} Greek are Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the Jewish historian Josephus, and the senator Cassius Dio. Other major Greek authors of the Empire include the biographer and antiquarian Plutarch, the geographer Strabo, and the rhetorician and satirist Lucian. Popular Greek romance novels were part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of long-form fiction works, represented in Latin by the Satyricon of Petronius and The Golden Ass of Apuleius.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants, such as {{vitamins}} C and E, {{have been}} proposed {{to protect against the}} disease, but results of studies have been contradictory and no positive effect has been proven. The results regarding fat and fatty acids have been contradictory, with various studies reporting protective effects, risk-increasing effects or no effects. There have been preliminary indications that the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium channel blockers may be protective. A 2010 meta-analysis found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (apart from aspirin), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of Parkinson's disease.|$|E

5|$|As part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> {{over the}} sub-surface platforms, the station {{buildings}} were remodelled internally {{to share a}} single entrance and ticket office. Space in the Piccadilly line building that was formerly used for operational purposes or as the exit to the street is now used for retail purposes. During the 2000s, the deep-level parts of the station underwent refurbishment with areas of damaged wall tiles being replaced. The dark green and cream tiled walls of the Piccadilly line's lower level passages and platforms were restored, with damaged tiles being replaced by reproductions to match the original designs.|$|E
5|$|At release, 1979 Revolution {{was well}} {{received}} by critics, with praise particularly {{directed at the}} narrative, characters and performances, and historical representations, though some criticism was directed at the quick-time sequences and visual quality. The game was also criticized by an Iranian journalist who declared it as propaganda. Khonsari felt afraid to reenter Iran as a result, and other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> team adopted aliases for protection. The game was nominated for multiple year-end accolades from several gaming publications.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current consensus is that the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E

5|$|Development began {{soon after}} Grand Theft Auto IVs release and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The {{development}} team drew influence {{from many of}} their previous projects such as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3, and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of its predecessors. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> work constituted the open world's creation, and several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the design team. The game's soundtrack features an original score composed {{by a team of}} producers who collaborated over several years.|$|E
5|$|End of Ages was {{positively}} received upon release. Despite complaints such as lessened interactivity compared to previous games and poorer graphics, publications including Macworld, Computer Gaming World, and The Washington Post judged the game a fitting {{end to the}} series. After End of Agess release, Cyan abruptly announced the end of software development and the layoff of most of its staff, but was able to rehire much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> team a few weeks later. Including End of Agess sales, the Myst franchise had sold more than 12 million copies by November 2007.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{investment}} in the project by the bank, the developers successfully sought modification of the original planning approval by the Perth City Council to allow {{the use of the}} Palace Hotel as a bank, rather than remaining as a public hotel. With this permission, construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> by Multiplex proceeded, and floor space was leased rapidly; by October 1985 only four floors of the building remained for lease and it was expected to be fully let before completion.|$|E

Maxwell was put in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of the Cavendish Laboratory, supervising every step in the {{progress}} of the building and of the purchase of the collection of apparatus. One of Maxwell's last great contributions to science was the editing (with copious original notes) of the research of Henry Cavendish, from which it appeared that Cavendish researched, amongst other things, such questions as the density of the Earth and the composition of water.|$|E
