5|$|Non-military use of {{camouflage}} includes making cell telephone towers less <b>obtrusive</b> {{and helping}} hunters to approach wary game animals. Patterns derived from military camouflage are frequently used in fashion clothing, exploiting their strong designs and sometimes their symbolism. Camouflage themes recur in modern art, and both figuratively and literally in science fiction and works of literature.|$|E
5|$|A {{roof was}} {{restored}} to the Main Stand by 1951 and, soon after, the three remaining stands were covered, the operation culminating {{with the addition of}} a roof to the Stretford End (now the West Stand) in 1959. The club also invested £40,000 in the installation of proper floodlighting, so that they would be able to use the stadium for the European games that were played in the late evening of weekdays, instead of having to play at Maine Road. In order to avoid <b>obtrusive</b> shadows being cast on the pitch, two sections of the Main Stand roof were cut away. The first match to be played under floodlights at Old Trafford was a First Division match between Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers on 25 March 1957.|$|E
5|$|Measure 32 was {{a medium}} pattern of <b>obtrusive</b> polygons in navy blue or black, against {{background}} polygons of lighter grays and greens. This measure emphasized mistaken identity and course deception to complicate submarine attack. Patterns were carried across the bow, and light gray was used aft to blend with the wake. This measure {{was based on}} the World War I dazzle system modified by observations in the western Pacific; and was applied to most surface ships in the Pacific during 1944 and 1945. Different patterns were devised for classes with large numbers of ships so the pattern would not identify the class of ship.|$|E
25|$|The low {{weight of}} PRT's small {{vehicles}} allows smaller guideways and support structures than mass transit systems like light rail. The smaller structures translate into lower construction costs, smaller easements, and less visually <b>obtrusive</b> infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|Some {{features}} of Windows 7 are faster booting, Device Stage, Windows PowerShell, less <b>obtrusive</b> User Account Control, multi-touch, and improved window management. Features included with Windows Vista {{and not in}} Windows 7 include the sidebar (although gadgets remain) and several programs that were removed in favor of downloading their Windows Live counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Offshore wind {{turbines}} are less <b>obtrusive</b> than turbines on land, as their apparent size and noise is mitigated by distance. Because water has less surface roughness than land (especially deeper water), the average wind speed is usually considerably higher over open water. Capacity factors (utilisation rates) are considerably {{higher than for}} onshore locations.|$|E
25|$|Light pollution, {{also known}} as photopollution, is the {{presence}} of anthropogenic light in the night environment. It is exacerbated by excessive, misdirected or <b>obtrusive</b> uses of light, but even carefully used light fundamentally alters natural conditions. As a major side-effect of urbanization, it is blamed for compromising health, disrupting ecosystems and spoiling aesthetic environments.|$|E
25|$|The other duty of {{the chair}} — the {{advancement}} of mathematical science — was discharged in a handsome manner by the long series of memoirs that he published, ranging over every department of pure mathematics. But it was also discharged in a much less <b>obtrusive</b> way; he became the standing referee {{on the merits of}} mathematical papers to many societies both at home and abroad.|$|E
25|$|But overweening vanity {{formed a}} strong part of Cruikshank's character. He boasted {{so much of}} the {{assistance}} he had rendered authors, that at last he believed he had written their works. Had he been connected with Fielding, he would no doubt have asserted that he wrote a great portion of Tom Jones. Moreover, he was excessively troublesome and <b>obtrusive</b> in his suggestions. Mr. Dickens declared to me that he could not stand it, and should send him printed matter in future.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the statements relating to prosecutions of persons because of their sexual orientation, {{the head of the}} delegation said that homosexuality is a purely private matter, with a long history in Senegal, and is not in itself a cause for prosecution. The prosecutions referred to occurred only when the homosexual relations took place in public and were of an <b>obtrusive</b> nature, therefore placing them in conflict with morality and religion. Concerning decriminalization, it is necessary to take account of the culture, and avoid exacerbating the rejection of homosexuals and endangering their lives.|$|E
25|$|Another Fairbairn crane survives at Dover, on the {{quayside}} of Wellington Dock. It is now {{a scheduled}} ancient monument.This is a hand-cranked crane of 1868, built by the Fairbairn Engineering Company of Manchester. When originally installed it was rated at 50 tons and worked by four men. The Ordnance Department of the Royal Navy used it for handling cannon. In later years it was down-rated to 20 tons and was used for lifting yachts from what was now Dover Marina. In 2014 the crane was 'lovingly restored' and repainted, with an <b>obtrusive</b> vertical steel prop beneath the jib.|$|E
25|$|Most {{designers}} avoid track switching, instead advocating vehicle-mounted switches or conventional steering. Those designers {{say that}} vehicle-switching permits faster switching, so vehicles can be closer together. It also simplifies the guideway, makes junctions less visually <b>obtrusive</b> {{and reduces the}} impact of malfunctions, because a failed switch on one vehicle {{is less likely to}} affect other vehicles. Other designers point out that track-switching simplifies the vehicles, reducing the number of small moving parts in each car. Track-switching replaces in-vehicle mechanisms with larger track-moving components, that can be designed for durability with little regard for weight or size.|$|E
25|$|A newer {{method for}} {{predicting}} and measuring {{various aspects of}} light pollution was described in the journal Lighting Research Technology (September 2008). Scientists at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Lighting Research Center have developed a comprehensive method called Outdoor Site-Lighting Performance (OSP), which allows users to quantify, and thus optimize, the performance of existing and planned lighting designs and applications to minimize excessive or <b>obtrusive</b> light leaving the boundaries of a property. OSP {{can be used by}} lighting engineers immediately, particularly for the investigation of glow and trespass (glare analyses are more complex to perform and current commercial software does not readily allow them), and can help users compare several lighting design alternatives for the same site.|$|E
25|$|In British 00 scale (similar to H0 scale) models the 'tension lock' coupler {{developed}} by Tri-ang is standard. This {{is similar in}} operation to the meatchopper type of coupling. Remote uncoupling is possible by using a sprung ramp between the rails. The design of the hooks is such that the couplings will not uncouple when under tension (instead depressing the ramp). When the train is pushed over the ramp, it will lift the coupling hooks as the train passes over. By halting the train over the ramp, it is split at this point. While it works well, it is often seen as ugly and <b>obtrusive</b> (although smaller designs are available, these are not always fully compatible with other models) and many British modellers prefer to retrofit either Kadee types or working hook and chain couplings.|$|E
25|$|Of his cathedral restorations, {{inspired}} as {{they were}} by the mistaken idea that a medieval church ought to be homogeneous in style and unencumbered by screens, monuments, and other <b>obtrusive</b> relics of the past, {{it can only be}} said that the Chapters who employed him were no more enlightened than their architect, and that at Westminster Abbey at least he accomplished an urgent work of repair in an unexceptionable manner. His activities at Salisbury, Durham, Hereford, and Lichfield were bitterly criticized by John Carter in his Pursuits of Architectural Innovation, and it was due in large measure to Carter's persistent denunciation that, in 1796, Wyatt failed to secure election as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In the following year, however, he was permitted to add F.S.A. to his name by a majority of one hundred and twenty-three votes.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in almost}} all cases we are {{involved}} in the world in an ordinary, and more involved, way. We are usually doing things with a view to achieving something. Take for example, a hammer: it is ready-to-hand; we use it without theorizing. In fact, if we were to look at it as present-at-hand, we might easily make a mistake. Only when it breaks or something goes wrong might we see the hammer as present-at-hand, just lying there. Even then however, it may be not fully present-at-hand, as it is now showing itself as something to be repaired or disposed, and therefore a part of the totality of our involvements. In this case its Being may be seen as unreadiness-to-hand. Heidegger outlines three manners of unreadiness-to-hand: Conspicuous (damaged; e.g., a lamp's wiring has broken), <b>Obtrusive</b> (a part is missing which is required for the entity to function; e.g., we find the bulb is missing), Obstinate (when the entity is a hindrance to us in pursuing a project; e.g., the lamp blocks my view of the computer screen).|$|E
25|$|Hoveyda's plan {{to crack}} down on {{corruption}} became an example of the entrenched ineptitude of many in power. Many important members of the government were corrupt, and the Shah was consistently flattered and schmoozed by them and {{turned a blind eye to}} the problem. The Shah began receiving an increasingly distorted picture of Iranian society, while becoming completely blind to increasing frustration to this rule by regular Iranians, as well as the shortcomings of his own government. Hoveyda's inability to move forward with his personal mandate eventually turned the overtly optimistic prime minister into a cynic. After years of political maneuvering, most of his proposed initiatives were stonewalled by bureaucratic obstacles. During the 1970s, the now veteran Prime Minister became nonchalant when it came to following through with his own convictions. His earlier aggression towards the dysfunctions of an <b>obtrusive</b> system slowly turned into feigned support. Publicly, Hoveyda assumed the notion that the regime in its current state would eventually reform on its own, and that political liberalization was only a small issue in the grand scheme of modernization. In private, Hoveyda often lamented over Iran's conditions, admitting to insufficiencies of the state and his own political impotence. The powerlessness of the premier's office was coupled with intricate internal rivalries. Hoveyda had an intensely rough relationship with the likes of Asadollah Alam and Ardeshir Zahedi, son of the famed participant in the 1953 coup against Mossadegh, General Fazlollah Zahedi.|$|E
500|$|Among the show's main child characters, Cartman is {{distinguished}} as [...] "the fat kid", and his obesity {{is a continuing}} subject of insults and ridicule from other characters throughout the show's run. Cartman is frequently portrayed as an antagonist or villain whose actions set in motion the events serving as the main plot of an episode. Other children and classmates are alienated by Cartman's insensitive, racist, xenophobic, anti-semitic, lazy, self-righteous behavior, but are occasionally influenced by his <b>obtrusive,</b> manipulative, and propagandist antics.|$|E
500|$|From 1906 Abd al-Rahman {{lived in}} Gezirat al-Fil, near to Omdurman. He {{was subject to}} {{constant}} and <b>obtrusive</b> supervision by the intelligence department. After 1908 Abd al-Rahman was allowed to live in Omdurman and study under a distinguished Azharite named Muhammad al-Badawi, where he gained some understanding of Islamic jurisprudence and the fundamentals of his religion, including the Hadith, or Prophet's tradition. However, he was never to become a well-educated and knowledgeable Islamic scholar as his father had been. The government lent him money to build the family mosque in Omdurman in 1908, and let him farm part of his father's land on Aba Island. He emphasized his peaceful intentions, convincing the colonialist government that his movement was not dangerous. A British official described him in 1909, when he was aged about twenty-four, as [...] "an obsequious, sorry-looking youth in soiled clothes". In 1910 he made a public speech in which he supported the Condominium administration of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.|$|E
500|$|As the album's producer, Hendrix had a {{difficult}} time completing the task. [...] Presented with the sometimes problematic recordings and resigned to turning it over to a different record company, Hendrix expressed his dissatisfaction with the final product. [...] Shortly after its release, Band of Gypsys reached the top ten of the album charts in the US and UK as well as appearing in charts in several other countries. [...] Although it was as popular as his albums with the Experience, it received mixed reviews. [...] Some faulted the performances as tentative and underprepared; additionally, Miles' contributions on drums and vocals have been characterized as plodding and <b>obtrusive.</b> [...] However, [...] "Machine Gun" [...] is generally regarded as the album's highlight and one of Hendrix's greatest achievements. [...] The influence of Band of Gypsys is heard in the funk rock developments of the 1970s and has been cited as an inspiration by various later rock musicians. Reissues of the album on compact disc included three extra songs recorded during the Fillmore East shows, and additional material has been released on later albums.|$|E
500|$|Many Victorian critics {{appreciated}} {{the emotion of}} the [...] "Lucy poems" [...] and focused on [...] "Strange fits". John Wilson, a personal friend of both Wordsworth and Coleridge, described the poem in 1842 as [...] "powerfully pathetic". In 1849, critic Rev. Francis Jacox, writing under the pseudonym [...] "Parson Frank", remarked that [...] "Strange fits" [...] contained [...] "true pathos. We are moved to our soul's centre by sorrow expressed as that is; for, without periphrasis or wordy anguish, without circumlocution of officious and <b>obtrusive,</b> and therefore, artificial grief; the mourner gives sorrow words... But he does it in words as few as may be: how intense their beauty!" [...] A few years later, John Wright, an early Wordsworth commentator, described the contemporary perception that [...] "Strange fits" [...] had a [...] "deep but subdued and 'silent fervour'". Other reviewers emphasised the importance of [...] "She dwelt among the untrodden ways", including Scottish writer William Angus Knight (1836–1916), when he described the poem as an [...] "incomparable twelve lines".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to his costume chores, Fletcher designed the Klingon and Vulcan makeup. Makeup artist Thomas R. Burman suggested that Fletcher was asked to help because the studio neglected to contract the work out; Burman received a contract only {{three weeks before the}} start of photography. Burman's bid of $160,000 was much higher than Paramount's $50,000 budget, but he secured the job when his competitor dropped out close to the start of production. [...] "It didn't come down to money in the end but to who could do it quickly [...] we had a [...] for working fast and doing quality work," [...] Burman explained. Fletcher and Burman agreed that the cragged foreheads of the Klingons in The Motion Picture were too prominent, obscuring the individuals' faces. [...] "It was just too cartoonish, and I didn't want a Star Wars look in [...] movie. There had never been a good marriage between the forehead appliance and the actor's faces. We tried to keep them in character rather than have these <b>obtrusive</b> things on their heads," [...] Burman said. The resulting Klingon makeup took two hours to apply.|$|E
500|$|Carr {{begins his}} {{argument}} by reasoning how {{the capacity to}} concentrate may be weakened by regular Internet usage. He mentions a historical example involving Friedrich Nietzsche's usage of a typewriter, a fairly new technology in the 1880s. According to German scholar Friedrich A. Kittler, Nietzsche's prose style changed when he started using a typewriter, which he had adopted because of his developing difficulty with writing by hand due to failing eyesight. Carr proceeds to explain that scientific {{research in the field}} of neuroplasticity as of 2008 has demonstrated that the brain's neural circuitry can in fact be rewired. In the humanities, sociologist Daniel Bell coined the term [...] "intellectual technologies" [...] to describe those technologies that extend the brain's cognitive faculties, and Carr states that he believes that the human brain adopts the qualities of these intellectual technologies. In discussing the mechanical clock, Carr deliberates upon the benefits and losses that are characteristic of new technologies. Then, Carr ventures that the cognitive impact of the Internet may be far more encompassing than any other previous intellectual technology because the Internet is gradually performing the services of most intellectual technologies, thus replacing them. Carr finally contends that the prevalent style of presentation for much of the Internet's content may significantly hinder the capacity to concentrate due to the many distractions that often surround the Internet's content, in the form of ads and <b>obtrusive</b> notifications. Additionally, he claims that these detrimental effects on concentration are compounded by traditional media because they are gradually adopting a style of presentation for their content that mimics the Internet, in order to remain competitive as consumer expectations change.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year, Channel 5 commissioned Newman Street {{to produce}} a new police procedural series, the broadcaster’s first original drama for eight years. Building on the drama/documentary hybrid format, Suspects was filmed in a less <b>obtrusive</b> fly-on-the wall documentary [...] style than Crime Stories, but still relied on the actors to improvise the dialogue based on a tightly plotted storylines.|$|E
2500|$|The chapel is set a {{long way}} back from the street within its graveyard. [...] At the time of its construction, mistrust of Christian {{denominations}} outside the Established (Anglican) Church was still prevalent, and the building intentionally avoided drawing attention to itself or its congregation by being <b>obtrusive.</b> [...] The graveyard survives on three sides, although many monuments were moved or taken away in 1976.|$|E
2500|$|Beatified figures, not yet canonised as saints, are {{sometimes}} shown in medieval Italian art with linear rays radiating {{out from the}} head, but no circular edge of the nimbus defined; later this became a less <b>obtrusive</b> form of halo {{that could be used}} for all figures. [...] Mary has, especially from the Baroque period onwards, a special form of halo in a circle of twelve stars, derived from her identification as the Woman of the Apocalypse.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the public}} debate over the {{expansion}} of advertising in the 1920s, Senator Pepper argued for a [...] "nationwide code of regulation," [...] described in a 1929 speech to the Outdoor Advertising Association of America. He pointed out that in preserving natural beauty, no national economic benefit was lost—-real estate values would increase without the addition of billboards. Pepper voiced {{what was then the}} general public fear: that if billboards became mainstream, advertising would become too <b>obtrusive.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The film drew {{frequent}} {{comparisons to}} {{the works of}} Andrei Tarkovsky, as well as visually referencing Ingmar Bergman, Robert Bresson, and Michelangelo Antonioni. Birgit Beumers of KinoKultura criticized {{this aspect of the}} film, stating [...] "these quotations are <b>obtrusive</b> and too obvious" [...] while Neil Young's Film Lounge concurred, stating [...] "Zvyagintsev has ended up merely aping the cinematic giants who have come before him." [...] Empires David Parkinson said the film [...] "feels more like a ciné dissertation designed to showcase Zvyagintsev's appreciation of the medium than an original piece of cinema." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1935, the United States Navy Naval Research Laboratory began {{studies and}} tests on low {{visibility}} ship camouflage. Research continued through World War II to (1) reduce visibility by painting vertical surfaces to harmonize with {{the horizon and}} horizontal surfaces to blend with the sea, or (2) confuse identity and course by painting <b>obtrusive</b> patterns on vertical surfaces. Some camouflage methods served both purposes. [...] American captains exercised less freedom of interpretation with these schemes (other than Measure 12 Modified) than their British Commonwealth counterparts applied to Admiralty camouflage schemes.|$|E
2500|$|With {{very rare}} exceptions, diapering is not [...] {{a part of}} [...] the blazon, but is mere decoration, or {{ornamental}} accessory. Thus a shield with diapering is considered {{the same as a}} shield of the same design but without diapering. For this reason diapering must not be so <b>obtrusive</b> or so heavily drawn that it could be mistaken for a substantive charge or for a variation of the field. This is especially the case with diaper of simple cross-hatching which might be mistaken for a field of lozengy.|$|E
2500|$|Many attractions {{are housed}} in large, soundstage-like buildings, {{some of which are}} {{partially}} or completely disguised by external theming. Generally, these buildings are painted a dull green color in areas not seen by guests, this choice helps to disguise the buildings among the foliage and make them less visually <b>obtrusive.</b> Walt Disney Imagineering has termed this color [...] "Go Away Green." [...] Most of them have off-white flat roofs that support HVAC units and footpaths for cast members. Inside are the rides, as well as hidden walkways, service areas, control rooms, and other behind-the-scenes operations.|$|E

Some of the new features included a revamped Aero subsystem, and a completely overhauled and significantly less <b>obtrusive</b> User Account Control interface. [...] "List view" [...] in Windows Explorer was brought back, after having been removed in Beta 1. Microsoft developer Ben Betz later explained in a blog entry that, while they felt that removing List mode made sense based on usability research and its inability to support Windows Explorer's new [...] "grouping" [...] feature, the feature was restored based on {{a great deal of}} feedback from beta testers.|$|E
2500|$|Cohen's {{book was}} {{mentioned}} in Yugoslavia and its Historians, published by Stanford University Press in 2003. In a chapter titled Clio amid the Ruins. Yugoslavia and Its Predecessors in Recent Historiography, Dušan J. Djordjevich observes that [...] "the {{quantity and quality}} of new historiography on Serbs and Serbia are disappointing", and states that [...] "fforts to reinterpret or fill gaps in the literature are often subject to <b>obtrusive,</b> distorting agendas of apology or condemnation". In a footnote to these observations, Djordjevich describes Cohen's and another book as ones which explore important topics, but [...] "in which censorious zeal trumps balanced scholarship".|$|E
2500|$|The March 1976 coup, led by General Jorge Videla, only {{escalated}} this conflict; the [...] "Dirty War" [...] {{resulted in}} 30,000 desaparecidos (people kidnapped {{and killed by}} the military {{during the years of}} the junta). The silent marches of their mothers (Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo) are a well-known image of Argentines' suffering during those times. The dictatorship's appointed mayor, Osvaldo Cacciatore, also drew up plans for a network of freeways intended to relieve the city's acute traffic gridlock. The plan, however, called for a seemingly indiscriminate razing of residential areas and, though only three of the eight planned were put up at the time, they were mostly <b>obtrusive</b> raised freeways that continue to blight a number of formerly comfortable neighborhoods to this day.|$|E
2500|$|Curtiss and Fromkin {{wrote that}} by 1973 Genie {{seemed to be}} slowly {{improving}} her articulation {{and that she had}} clearly strengthened and gained more control over her voice, and by at least the middle of that year she could distinguish and articulate all the sounds of General American. During that year she started to use pitch variation in addition to vowel duration to indicate stress, with the latter remaining the primary method for doing so but becoming much less <b>obtrusive</b> and exaggerated, but she still did not vary pitch or volume to indicate either questions or imperative sentences. While her voice remained largely monotonic she began including [...] more speech patterns and intonation, sometimes in spontaneous speech but more consistently in imitation. Despite this she still did not use either voiced or voiceless dental fricatives in spontaneous speech, though she had imitated them since June 1972, and inconsistently used affricates in spontaneous speech.|$|E
