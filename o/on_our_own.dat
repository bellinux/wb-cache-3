25|$|Of course these {{movements}} exercised tremendous {{pressure on the}} British Government and shook the government machinery.

They acted courageously and did not submit so easily to unjust oppression; their outlook widened and they began to think a little in terms of India as a whole.... It was a remarkable transformation and the Congress, under Gandhi's leadership, must have the credit for it.|$|E

25|$|A {{feature that}} distinguishes humans from most animals {{is that we}} are not born with an {{extensive}} repertoire of behavioral programs that would enable us to survive <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> ("physiological prematurity"). To compensate for this, we have an unmatched ability to learn, i.e., to consciously acquire such programs by imitation or exploration. Once consciously acquired and sufficiently exercised, these programs can become automated to the extent that their execution happens beyond the realms of our awareness. Take, as an example, the incredible fine motor skills exerted in playing a Beethoven piano sonata or the sensorimotor coordination required to ride a motorcycle along a curvy mountain road. Such complex behaviors are possible only because a sufficient number of the subprograms involved can be executed with minimal or even suspended conscious control. In fact, the conscious system may actually interfere somewhat with these automated programs.|$|E

In June 2017, it was reported that the band would return to Studio X in Seattle to record a new album later that month, for a tentative early 2018 release. The sessions will be helmed by Nick Raskulinecz, who produced the band's last two albums. Studio X was the studio where Alice in Chains recorded its 1995 self-titled album.

They've had writers work on it since then." [...] Josh Cooley and Meg LeFauve were credited as co-writers of the screenplay following their contributions during the rewrite. Like Docter, Cooley and LeFauve included experiences with raising their own children into the screenplay.

500|$|The band {{continued}} its boycott against Ticketmaster during its 1995 tour for Vitalogy, but {{was surprised that}} virtually no other bands joined in. Pearl Jam's initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues effectively, with a few exceptions, prevented it from playing shows in the United States {{for the next three}} years. Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> and it pretty much killed us, killed our career." [...] In the same year Pearl Jam backed Neil Young, whom the band had noted as an influence, on his album Mirror Ball. Contractual obligations prevented the use of the band's name anywhere on the album, but the members were all credited individually in the album's liner notes. Two songs from the sessions were left off Mirror Ball: [...] "I Got Id" [...] and [...] "Long Road". These two tracks were released separately by Pearl Jam {{in the form of the}} 1995 EP, Merkin Ball.|$|E
500|$|The Ludys {{argue that}} one's love {{life should be}} both guided by and {{subordinate}} to one's relationship with God.

The Ludys contest the definition of [...] "true love" [...] as an emotion; instead, they define [...] "true love" [...] as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that [...] "there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs.

Ellen DeGeneres presented Gaga with a bikini made of vegetables when the singer appeared on her talk show, and the singer used the platform to respond to the controversy surrounding the dress saying, [...] "... it has many interpretations.
