25|$|At {{the price}} of {{increased}} complication for a high pressure diesel type injection system, fuel consumption in the same range as small pre-chamber automotive and industrial diesels has been demonstrated with Curtiss-Wright's stratified charge multi-fuel engines, while preserving Wankel rotary advantages Unlike a piston and <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine,</b> there are no valves which can float at higher rpm causing loss of performance. The Wankel is a more effective design at high revolutions with no reciprocating parts, far fewer moving parts and no cylinder head.|$|E

500|$|The muscle-car era {{is deeply}} rooted in the 1950s, {{although}} there is some debate as to the exact beginning. Old Cars Weekly claims it started with the introduction of the original Chrysler [...] "Firepower" [...] hemi V8 engine in 1951, while others such as Hot Rod magazine consider the first <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine</b> by Chevrolet, the 265 cid V8, as the [...] "heir apparent to Ford flathead's position as the staple of racing", in 1955. The [...] "small block Chevy" [...] itself developed its own subculture that exists today. Other contenders include the 1949 Oldsmobile V8 engine, the first {{in a long line of}} such powerful V8 engines, as well as the Cadillac V8 of the same year.|$|E
50|$|The {{motorcycles}} {{were made}} in several models ranging from 98 cc two stroke to 750 cc <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> four cylinder <b>engines.</b> There were also one and two cylinder models, with a sheet metal frame and Cardan shaft final drive.

50|$|Following World War I, {{the company}} offered 12, 18 and 30 hp cars. By 1923 {{the whole range}} was fitted with <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines</b> of entirely new design {{and a variety of}} {{coachwork}} styles.|$|R
50|$|From 1946 to 1953, the AMA Grand National Champion was crowned {{based on}} the results of a single race, the Springfield Mile held at the Illinois State Fairgrounds Racetrack.

The flathead six had no visible intake manifold since it was integrated within the cylinder head, while the exhaust manifold is a [...] "log-type" [...] {{that looks like a}} long tube. All models received an enlarged gas tank, now [...] capacity, while power steering was a new option.|$|E
2500|$|At mid-year 1977, Pontiac {{introduced}} the Phoenix, an upscale {{version of the}} Ventura which replaced the Ventura entirely {{after the end of}} the 1977 model year. Pontiac also introduced its 151 cubic inch [...] "Iron Duke" [...] 4-cylinder <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine.</b> It was first used in the 1977 Astre, replacing Astre's aluminum-block 140 cubic inch Vega engine. The 'Iron Duke' engine would later go into many GM and non-GM automobiles into the early 1990s. The 151 cubic inch L4 and the 301 cubic inch V8 were the last two engines designed solely by Pontiac. Subsequent engine design would be accomplished by one central office with all designs being shared by each brand.|$|E
2500|$|While the C5 {{may have}} been {{initially}} criticized for using inexpensive materials and older technology (e.g., [...] composites in body panels and floor boards; an OHV engine; and leaf springs), ostensibly as cost-cutting measures, these components are actually very strong for their relatively light weight (low mass), or have proven reliability. The C5's modular body panels make excellent use of a lightweight composite material known in the automotive industry as SMC or Sheet Molded Composite, a type of fiberglass that is blended and bonded with plastics. SMC provides better protection against direct blows because it is very stiff and will not dent. The floor boards on the C5 are a composite sandwich of SMC with balsa wood in the middle. Balsa wood was chosen for its extreme stiffness, light weight and excellent sound absorption qualities. The all aluminium LS1 <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine</b> is much lighter than its cast iron predecessor, the LT1, and provides for a much lower hoodline when compared to an overhead cam design of relative displacement. The composite leaf springs are much lighter and sit much lower than typical coil springs and help provide the C5 with its excellent ride characteristics and distinctive ride height.|$|E

A common example of this is, in <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines,</b> replacing the production rocker arms with replacements incorporating roller bearings in the roller contacting the valve stem.|$|R
5000|$|American {{automakers}} {{found it}} more profitable to sell slow-speed straight-sixes as [...] "economy" [...] engines, and V8s as [...] "performance" [...] engines {{regardless of their}} horsepower potential, since big, unsophisticated, <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines</b> were relatively cheap to manufacture, and fuel economy was not a concern prior to the 1973 oil crisis.|$|R

50|$|The side-valve {{engines of}} the {{immediate}} post WW1 era were inefficient, and the intrinsic limitations of their combustion chamber geometries prevented them from achieving high enough compression ratios to develop reasonable power outputs. Only the more complex and much less reliable <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines</b> could manage respectable power figures; these were generally confined to sports and expensive luxury cars.|$|R
50|$|The system {{discouraged}} manufacturers from {{switching to}} more fuel-efficient <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines</b> as these generally required larger bores, while the established sidevalve layout could easily use very narrow bores. Despite OHV engines having significant benefits in economy, refinement and performance the RAC system often made these engines {{more expensive to}} run because it placed them in a higher tax class than sidevalve engines of identical power output.|$|R

The flathead single-cylinder motorcycles were designated Model A for engines with magneto systems only and Model B for engines with battery and coil systems, while <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> versions were designated Model AA and Model BA respectively, and a magneto-only racing version was designated Model S.
