40|$|We {{investigate}} scenarios {{in which}} dark matter {{interacts with the}} Standard Model primarily through electroweak gauge bosons. We employ an effective field theory frame-work wherein the Standard Model and the dark matter particle are the only light states in order to derive model-independent bounds. Bounds on such interactions are derived from dark matter production by weak boson fusion at the LHC, indirect detection searches for the products of dark matter annihilation and from the measured invisible width of the Z 0. We find that limits on the UV scale, Λ, reach weak scale values for most operators {{and values of the}} dark matter mass, thus probing the most natural scenarios in the WIMP dark matter paradigm. Our bounds suggest that light dark matter (mχ < ∼ mZ/ 2 or mχ < ∼ 100 − 200 GeV, depending on the operator) cannot interact only with the electroweak gauge bosons of the Standard Model, but rather requires additional operator contributions or dark sector structure to avoid <b>overclosing</b> the universe...|$|E
40|$|We {{calculate}} the cosmic ray positron and antiproton spectra of a gauge-Higgs dark matter candidate in a warped five-dimensional SO(5) × U(1) gauge-Higgs unification model. The {{stability of the}} gauge-Higgs boson is guaranteed by the H parity under which only the Higgs boson is odd at low energy. The 4 -point vertices of HHW^+W^- and HHZZ, allowed by H parity conservation, have the same magnitude as in the standard model, which yields efficient annihilation rate for m_H > m_W. The most dominant annihilation channel is H H → W^+ W^- followed by the subsequent decays of the W bosons into positrons or quarks, which undergo fragmentation into antiproton. Comparing with the observed positron and antiproton spectra with the PAMALA and Fermi/LAT, {{we found that the}} Higgs boson mass cannot be larger than 90 GeV, in order not to overrun the observations. Together with the constraint on not <b>overclosing</b> the Universe, the valid range of the dark matter mass is restricted to 70 - 90 GeV. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|Self-interacting {{dark matter}} (SIDM) {{is a simple}} and well-motivated {{scenario}} that could explain long-standing puzzles in structure formation on small scales. If the required self-interaction arises through a light mediator (with mass ∼ 10 MeV) in the dark sector, this new particle must be unstable to avoid <b>overclosing</b> the universe. The decay of the light mediator could happen due to a weak coupling of the hidden and visible sectors, providing new signatures for direct detection experiments. The SIDM nuclear recoil spectrum is more peaked towards low energies compared to the usual case of contact interactions, because the mediator mass {{is comparable to the}} momentum transfer of nuclear recoils. We show that the SIDM signal could be distinguished from that of DM particles with contact interactions by considering the time-average energy spectrum in experiments employing different target materials, or the average and modulated spectra in a single experiment. Using current limits from LUX and SuperCDMS, we also derive strong bounds on the mixing parameter between hidden and visible sector. Comment: 21 pages, 8 figures. To be published on JCA...|$|E
30|$|The node-to-surface {{contact between}} the strip and the {{concrete}} was modelled through the master-slave algorithm. General contact automatically assigns master and slave roles for contact interactions, and ABAQUS calculates an overclosure tolerance based {{on the size of}} the underlying element facets on a slave surface. Slave surfaces (or nodes) in a particular interaction are repositioned onto the associated master surface (or nodes) if the two surfaces are initially <b>overclosed</b> by a distance smaller than the calculated tolerance. Initial gaps between surfaces remain unchanged by default adjustments. If a portion of a slave surface is initially <b>overclosed</b> by a distance greater than the calculated tolerance, ABAQUS automatically generates a contact exclusion for this surface portion and its associated master surface. Therefore, general contact does not create interactions between surfaces (or portions of surfaces) that are severely <b>overclosed</b> in the initial configuration of the model, and these surfaces can freely penetrate each other throughout the analysis.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{cosmology}} of supersymmetric models {{in which the}} supersymmetry breaking effects are mediated by gauge interactions at about the 10 ^ 5 GeV scale. We first {{point out that the}} gravitino is likely to <b>overclose</b> the Universe in this class of models. This requires an entropy production, which prefers a baryogenesis mechanism at a relatively low temperature. The Affleck-Dine mechanism for baryogenesis is one of the possibilities to generate enough baryon asymmetry, but the analysis is non-trivial since the shape of the potential for the flat direction differs substantially from the conventional hidden sector case. To see this, we first perform a 2 -loop calculation to determine the shape of the potential. By combining the potential with the supergravity contribution, we then find that the Affleck-Dine baryogenesis works efficiently to generate sufficient baryon asymmetry. On the other hand, we also point out that string moduli fields, if present, are stable and their coherent oscillations <b>overclose</b> the Universe by more than 15 orders of magnitude. One needs a very late inflationary period with an e-folding of N ≳ 5 and an energy density of ≲ (10 ^ 7 GeV) ^ 4. A thermal inflation is enough for this purpose. Fortunately, the Affleck-Dine baryogenesis is so efficient that enough baryon asymmetry can survive the late inflation. Comment: 40 pages, LaTeX, epsf. st...|$|R

40|$|A QCD axion with a {{time-dependent}} {{decay constant}} {{has been known}} to be able to accommodate high-scale inflation without producing topological defects or too large isocurvature perturbations on CMB scales. We point out that a dynamical decay constant also has the effect of enhancing the small-scale axion isocurvature perturbations. The enhanced axion perturbations can even exceed the periodicity of the axion potential, and thus lead to the formation of axionic domain walls. Unlike the well-studied axionic walls, the walls produced from the enhanced perturbations are not bounded by cosmic strings, and thus would <b>overclose</b> the universe independently of the number of degenerate vacua along the axion potential.

40|$|A generic {{feature of}} gauge-mediated {{supersymmetry}} breaking models {{is that the}} gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP).

It is shown that the moduli problem can be relaxed by making use of parametric resonance. A new non-perturbative decay channel for moduli oscillations is discussed. This channel becomes effective when the oscillating field results in a net negative mass term for the decay products.
