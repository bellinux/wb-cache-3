5|$|Living mammal {{species can}} be {{identified}} {{by the presence of}} sweat glands, including those that are specialized to produce milk to nourish their young. In classifying fossils, however, <b>other</b> <b>features</b> must be used, since soft tissue glands and many <b>other</b> <b>features</b> are not visible in fossils.|$|E
5|$|All tracks {{except the}} few yards {{embedded}} in the quayside at Watchet were removed by 1920, but <b>other</b> <b>features</b> were removed or altered piecemeal over time. By 1940, for example, no trace remained of Washford station, but both sets of level crossing gates remained in place.|$|E

5|$|Interpretations of <b>other</b> <b>features</b> of Opabinia fossils differ. Since {{the animals}} {{did not have}} mineralized armor nor even tough organic exoskeletons like those of insects, their bodies were {{flattened}} as they were buried and fossilized, and smaller or internal features appear as markings within {{the outlines of the}} fossils.|$|E
5|$|The unusual {{characteristics}} that set it {{apart from other}} species in the genus include the woody rhizome, undivided styles, and the operculate pollen. Droseraregia shares <b>other</b> <b>features</b> with the robust Tasmanian form of D.arcturi, including the lack of stipules and petioles and the non-circinate growth of the scape.|$|E

30|$|Moving {{onto the}} {{diabetes}} dataset, {{we see that}} decision trees and KNN yield almost equivalent classification accuracy for the proposed method compared to <b>other</b> <b>feature</b> selection methods. However, the proposed method shows a slightly low classification accuracy with random forest and SVM classifiers. With the Car dataset, decision tree achieves 95 % classification accuracy which {{is equivalent to the}} results obtained for <b>other</b> <b>feature</b> selection methods. Similarly, with random forest our method gives around 96 % accuracy which is almost similar to the accuracy found on <b>other</b> <b>feature</b> selection methods. Moreover, KNN and SVM give higher classification accuracy on the proposed method compared to <b>other</b> <b>feature</b> selection methods. On Heart dataset, classification accuracy found on the proposed method is comparatively low with random forest, KNN and SVM classifier. However, decision tree gives better result on the proposed method compared to chisquare feature selection method only.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Table 6, on the Tic-Tac-Toe dataset, {{experimental}} result establishes that {{the performance of}} the proposed method is almost similar with <b>other</b> <b>feature</b> selection methods using SVM classifier. But, decision trees, random forest and KNN show low classification accuracy on the proposed method. In the similar fashion, on Zoo dataset, decision trees yield around 87 % accuracy which is almost same to the accuracy found on <b>other</b> <b>feature</b> selection methods. Similarly, SVM approximately yields 95 % accuracy, which is better than the results obtained by <b>other</b> <b>feature</b> selection methods employed in ensemble. Random forests and KNN yield a slightly lower classification accuracy on our proposed method.|$|R
5|$|Acrocanthosaurus is {{classified}} in the superfamily Allosauroidea within the infraorder Tetanurae. This superfamily is characterized by paired ridges on the nasal and lacrimal bones {{on top of the}} snout and tall neural spines on the neck vertebrae, among <b>other</b> <b>features.</b> It was originally placed in the family Allosauridae with Allosaurus, an arrangement also supported by studies as late as 2000. Most studies have found it {{to be a member of}} the related family Carcharodontosauridae.|$|E
5|$|Alongside the Unix File System, {{which is}} {{typically}} the default file system on BSDs, DragonFly BSD supports HAMMER file system. It was developed specifically for DragonFly BSD {{to provide a}} feature-rich yet better designed analogue of the increasingly popular ZFS. HAMMER supports configurable file system history, snapshots, checksumming, data deduplication and <b>other</b> <b>features</b> typical for file systems of its kind.|$|E
5|$|Although Jean-Jacques Dessalines, {{a pivotal}} {{figure in the}} Haitian Revolution, is barely {{mentioned}} in the novel, the one page dedicated to him emphasizes his connection to African gods while neglecting to mention any of his <b>other</b> <b>features</b> that made him an effective leader. While Dessaline's belief in African gods is highlighted, Henri Christophe's abandonment of the religion is stressed, being identified {{as the reason for}} his downfall.|$|E

5|$|An initial {{prototype}} design was developed between January and May 1964. When used with MAR, the MSR needed only short range, enough to hand off the Sprint missiles. This {{led to a}} design with limited radiated power. For Small City Defense, this would not offer enough power to acquire the warheads at reasonable range. This led to an upgraded design with five times the transmitter power, which was sent to Raytheon in May 1965. A further upgrade in May 1966 included the battle control computers and <b>other</b> <b>features</b> for the SCD system.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} pet species, {{a variety of}} colors, coat types, and <b>other</b> <b>features</b> that do {{not appear in the}} wild have either been developed, or have {{appeared}} spontaneously. Any individual rat may be defined one or more ways by its color, coat, marking, and non-standard body type. This allows for very specific classifications such as a ruby-eyed cinnamon Berkshire rex Dumbo.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of apeomyines, Apeomyoides was a large eomyid with high-crowned cheekteeth and a large gap between the incisors and cheekteeth. Furthermore, the cheekteeth—premolars and molars—approach a bilophodont pattern, with two distinct lobes. <b>Other</b> <b>features</b> distinguish Apeomyoides from other apeomyines, including the rectangular shape of the cheekteeth. The fourth lower premolar (p4) {{is larger than the}} molars behind it and has two roots, while the lower molars have three.|$|E

5|$|Blacklist has platform-specific features, {{including}} voice {{integration with}} Xbox 360's Kinect peripheral which allows players to distract enemies before attacking. A player {{can also use}} the Kinect sensor to control the protagonist with their body instead of the Xbox 360 controller. In the Wii U version, the Gamepad controller's touchscreen is an interface, accessing gadgets and <b>other</b> <b>features</b> from the protagonist's arm-mounted computer (OPSAT), and incorporating screen and motion controls to highlight enemies with thermal vision when using Killing in Motion. The Wii U version was not shipped with the game's cooperative mode.|$|E
5|$|Each {{neighbourhood}} has self-contained recreational areas, {{and there}} are other larger parks throughout the town. The Memorial Gardens, on the eastern side of Queen's Square, feature art displays, children's play areas and lawns, and a plaque commemorating those who died in two Second World War bombing incidents in 1943 and 1944. Goffs Park in Southgate covers , and has lakes, boating ponds, a model railway and many <b>other</b> <b>features.</b> Tilgate Park and Nature Centre has walled gardens, lakes, large areas of woodland with footpaths and bridleways, a golfing area and a collection of animals and birds.|$|E
5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and <b>other</b> <b>features</b> we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints {{is controlled by the}} amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to create a more resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.|$|E

The North Course is on rolling terrain, while the South Course features narrow, tree-lined fairways. <b>Other</b> <b>features</b> include playgrounds, athletic fields, and picnic areas.|$|E
5|$|Ida's surface appears heavily cratered {{and mostly}} gray, {{although}} minor color variations mark newly formed or uncovered areas. Besides craters, <b>other</b> <b>features</b> are evident, such as grooves, ridges, and protrusions. Ida {{is covered by}} {{a thick layer of}} regolith, loose debris that obscures the solid rock beneath. The largest, boulder-sized, debris fragments are called ejecta blocks, several of which have been observed on the surface.|$|E
5|$|If the TSH {{level is}} normal or low and serum free T4 levels are low, this is suggestive of central {{hypothyroidism}} (not enough TSH or TRH secretion by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus). There may be <b>other</b> <b>features</b> of hypopituitarism, such as menstrual cycle abnormalities and adrenal insufficiency. There {{might also be}} symptoms of a pituitary mass such as headaches and vision changes. Central hypothyroidism should be investigated further to determine the underlying cause.|$|E
