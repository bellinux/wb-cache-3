5|$|Brazil {{was created}} as a kingdom on 16 December 1815, when Prince João, Prince <b>of</b> <b>Brazil,</b> who was then acting as regent for his ailing mother, Queen Maria, {{elevated}} the colony to a constituent country of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. While the royal court was still based in Rio de Janeiro, João ascended as king {{of the united kingdom}} the following year, and returned to Portugal in 1821, leaving his son, Prince Pedro, Prince <b>of</b> <b>Brazil,</b> as his regent in the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Brazil.</b> In September of that same year, the Portuguese parliament threatened to diminish Brazil back to the status of a colony, dismantle all the royal agencies in Rio de Janeiro, and demanded Pedro return to Lisbon. The Prince, however, feared these moves would trigger separatist movements and refused to comply; instead, at the urging of his father, he declared Brazil an independent Nation on 7 September 1822, leading to the formation of the Empire <b>of</b> <b>Brazil,</b> a constitutional monarchy. Prince Pedro became the first Emperor <b>of</b> <b>Brazil</b> on 12 October 1822, with the title of Pedro I (on that date, he was formally offered the Throne of the newly created Empire, accepted it, and was acclaimed as monarch), and his coronation took place on 1 December 1822. After Pedro abdicated the throne on 7 April 1831, the Brazilian empire saw only one additional monarch: Pedro II, who reigned for 58 years before a coup d'état overthrew the monarchy on 15 November 1889. There are two pretenders to the defunct Brazilian throne: Prince Luiz of Orléans-Braganza, head of the Vassouras branch of the Brazilian Imperial Family, and, according to legitimist claims, de jure Emperor of Brazil; and Prince Pedro Carlos of Orléans-Braganza, head of the Petrópolis line of the Brazilian Imperial Family, and heir to the Brazilian throne according to royalists.|$|E
