5|$|Madhvacharya was {{critical}} of the teachings of Adi Shankara and argued the world is real and not an illusion. His Dvaita Vedanta gained popularity, enabling him to establish eight mathas in Udupi. Ramanuja, head of the Vaishnava monastery in Srirangam, preached the way <b>of</b> <b>devotion</b> (bhakti marga) and wrote Sribhashya, a critique on Adi Shankara's Advaita.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{sense of}} values and the feeling <b>of</b> <b>devotion</b> to a cause, which became so {{characteristic}} of him in later life, were derived, in part at least, from the instruction imparted so zealously and unquestioningly inside the severely unadorned walls of the Baptist Church at Otterville.|$|E

5|$|Females perform all {{tasks of}} feeding and raising offspring, and have {{occasionally}} been observed caring for orphaned pups. Much {{has been written}} about the level <b>of</b> <b>devotion</b> of sea otter mothers for their pups– a mother gives her infant almost constant attention, cradling it on her chest away from the cold water and attentively grooming its fur. When foraging, she leaves her pup floating on the water, sometimes wrapped in kelp to keep it from floating away; if the pup is not sleeping, it cries loudly until she returns. Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.|$|E
5|$|Prominent {{among the}} more than thirty women poets was Akka Mahadevi. Born to a {{merchant}} family in the town Udatadi (or Udugani) in the Shivamogga district, and possibly married against her wishes to a feudal chief called Kausika, she renounced worldly pleasures, opting for a life <b>of</b> <b>devotion</b> and asceticism. She is often compared to other such notable female saint-poets of Hinduism as Andal, Lalleswari and Meera Bai, and {{is considered one of the}} prominent female poets of the Kannada language.|$|E
5|$|The earlier Saxon Kings were {{assigned}} a gold cross {{on a blue}} shield, but this did not exist until the 13th century. The arms of Saint Edward the Confessor, a blue shield charged with a gold cross and five gold birds, {{appears to have been}} suggested by heralds in the time of Henry III of England (Boutell, 18) based on a coin minted in Edward's reign (Neubecker, 30). These arms were later used by Richard II of England out <b>of</b> <b>devotion</b> to the saint (Fraser, 44).|$|E

5|$|Heydrich {{developed}} close professional relationships {{only within}} the circle of the SS security forces. Heinrich Müller was one such example, and Heydrich appears to have trusted him. Adolf Eichmann's straightforward loyalty impressed Heydrich, and was one reason why he appointed him as secretary for the Wannsee Conference. Herbert Kappler, who was appointed as commander of all SS security forces in Rome, {{was said to have}} been a protégé of Heydrich. SS personnel favoured by Heydrich, especially those who attended the Wannsee conference, possessed similar traits <b>of</b> <b>devotion</b> to SS, lack of remorse regarding brutal or genocidal orders, and above all personal loyalty to Heydrich in his capacity as commander of the security forces. On the other hand, Heydrich's dislike and distrust of Arthur Nebe and Walter Schellenberg may have stemmed from their independence and ambition.|$|E
5|$|In most Scottish burghs, in {{contrast}} to English towns where churches and parishes tended to proliferate, there was usually only one parish church, As the doctrine of Purgatory gained importance in the period, the number of chapelries, priests and masses for the dead within them, designed to speed the passage of souls to Heaven, grew rapidly. The number of altars dedicated to saints, who could intercede in this process, also grew dramatically, with St. Mary's in Dundee having perhaps 48 and St Giles' in Edinburgh over 50. The number of saints celebrated in Scotland also proliferated, with about 90 being added to the missal used in St Nicholas church in Aberdeen. New cults <b>of</b> <b>devotion</b> connected with Jesus and the Virgin Mary began to reach Scotland in the fifteenth century, including the Five Wounds, the Holy Blood and the Holy Name of Jesus. There were also new religious feasts, including celebrations of the Presentation, the Visitation and Mary of the Snows.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages the {{problems}} of schism in the Catholic Church allowed the Scottish Crown to gain greater influence over senior appointments and two archbishoprics had been established {{by the end of}} the fifteenth century. Historians have discerned a decline in traditional monastic life in the late Middle Ages, but the mendicant orders of friars grew, particularly in the expanding burghs, emphasised preaching and ministering to the population. New saints and cults <b>of</b> <b>devotion</b> also proliferated. Despite problems over the number and quality of clergy after the Black Death in the fourteenth century, and evidence of heresy in the fifteenth century, the Church in Scotland remained stable before the Reformation in the sixteenth century.|$|E

5|$|Marian devotion {{grew from}} the 13th century, mostly forming around the {{concepts}} of the Immaculate Conception and her Assumption into heaven. In a culture that venerated the possession of relics {{as a means to}} bring the earthly closer to the divine, Mary left no bodily relics, thus assuming a special position between heaven and humanity. By the early 15th century, Mary had grown in importance within the Christian doctrine to the extent that she was commonly seen as the most accessible intercessor with God. It was thought that the length each person would need to suffer in limbo was proportional to their display <b>of</b> <b>devotion</b> while on earth. The veneration of Mary reached a peak in the early 15th century, an era that saw an unending demand for works depicting her likeness. From the mid-15th century, Netherlandish portrayals of the life of Christ tended to be centred on the iconography of the Man of Sorrows.|$|E
5|$|Mírzá Yahyá's {{leadership}} was controversial. He generally absented {{himself from the}} Bábí community, spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise; on several occasions he {{went so far as}} to publicly disavow allegiance to the Báb. Mírzá Yahyá gradually alienated himself from a large number of the Bábís, who started giving their allegiance to other claimants. During the time that Mírzá Yahyá remained in hiding, Bahá'u'lláh performed much of the daily administration of Bábí affairs. In contrast to Mírzá Yahyá, Bahá'u'lláh was outgoing and accessible and he was seen by an increasing number of Bábís as a religious leader, rather than just an organizer, and became their center <b>of</b> <b>devotion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{was about}} fifteen when Churchill {{returned}} from the Continent in 1675, and {{he appears to have}} been almost immediately captivated by her charms and considerable good looks. Churchill's amorous, almost abject, missives <b>of</b> <b>devotion</b> were, it seems, received with suspicion – his first lover, Barbara Villiers, was just moving her household to Paris, feeding doubts that he may well have been looking at Sarah as a replacement mistress rather than a fiancée. However, his persistent courtship over the coming months eventually won over the beautiful, if relatively poor, Maid of Honour. Although Winston wished his son to marry the wealthy Catherine Sedley (if only to ease his own burden of debt), Colonel Churchill married Sarah sometime in the winter of 1677–78, possibly in the apartments of the Duchess of York.|$|E

5|$|Scottish Protestantism in {{the seventeenth}} century was highly focused on the Bible, which was seen as infallible and the major source of moral authority. In {{the early part of the}} century the Genevan {{translation}} was commonly used. In 1611 the Kirk adopted the Authorised King James Version and the first Scots version was printed in Scotland in 1633, but the Geneva Bible continued to be employed into the late seventeenth century. Many Bibles were large, illustrated and highly valuable objects. They often became the subject of superstitions, being used in divination. Family worship was strongly encouraged by the Covenanters. Books <b>of</b> <b>devotion</b> were distributed to encourage the practice and ministers were encouraged to investigate whether this was being carried out.|$|E
5|$|The Bhakti (devotional) {{movement}} was active during this time, and involved well known Haridasas (devotee saints) of that time. Like the Virashaiva {{movement of the}} 12th century, this movement presented another strong current <b>of</b> <b>devotion,</b> pervading the lives of millions. The haridasas represented two groups, the Vyasakuta and Dasakuta, the former being required to be proficient in the Vedas, Upanishads and other Darshanas, while the Dasakuta merely conveyed the message of Madhvacharya through the Kannada language {{to the people in}} the form of devotional songs (Devaranamas and Kirthanas). The philosophy of Madhvacharya was spread by eminent disciples such as Naraharitirtha, Jayatirtha, Sripadaraya, Vyasatirtha, Vadirajatirtha and others. Vyasatirtha, the guru (teacher) of Vadirajatirtha, Purandaradasa (Father of Carnatic music) and Kanakadasa earned the devotion of King Krishnadevaraya. The king considered the saint his Kuladevata (family deity) and honoured him in his writings. During this time, another great composer of early carnatic music, Annamacharya composed hundreds of Kirthanas in Telugu at Tirupati in present-day Andhra Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|The Vaishnava Bhakti (devotional) {{movement}} involving well-known haridasas (devotee saints) of the 14th through 16th centuries made {{an indelible}} imprint on Kannada literature, {{with the development}} of a body of literature called Haridasa Sahitya ("Haridasa literature"). This philosophy presented another strong current <b>of</b> <b>devotion,</b> pervading the lives of millions, similar to the effects of the Veerashaiva movement of the 12th century. The haridasas conveyed the message of Madhvacharya through esoteric Sanskrit writings (written by Vyasa kuta or Vyasa school) and simple Kannada language compositions, appealing to the common man, in the form of devotional songs (written by the Dasa Kuta or Dasa school). The philosophy of Madhvacharya was spread by eminent disciples such as Naraharitirtha, Jayatirtha, Vyasatirtha, Sripadaraya, Vadirajatirtha, Purandara Dasa, Kanaka Dasa and others.|$|E
