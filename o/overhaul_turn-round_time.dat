During March 1960, the Drakens of unit F13 participated in a three-day long exercise, flying by night and day while operating under a state of [...] "highest readiness" [...] throughout. According to Flight International, the introduction to service of the J 35A was [...] "very smooth", and that the scramble and <b>turn-round</b> <b>times</b> had {{been found to be}} [...] "most satisfactory".

When no wharf was available, the barge could use the ebbing tide {{to stand on the}} mud, close to shore and offload its goods onto carts. A barge with no topsail - or top mast sailing stumpy-rigged required a smaller crew. With a shallow draught, they could penetrate deep into the back waters.

40|$|Everybody {{agrees that}} {{containers}} are a "good thing";the actual advantages of transporting cargo, and in particular, dry cargo, in containers over {{other forms of}} transport have, to our knowledge, nowhere been stated in quantitative terms. It is claimed that containers will reduce the <b>turn-round</b> <b>time</b> of ships, ease congestion in the docks, speed-up total transit time of cargo, {{reduce the risk of}} pilferage, reduce packaging cost and reduce total handling effort in all stages of transit. Given that all these advantages are real, it is obvious that they do not accrue in equal measure to all parties concerned in the movement of goods from consignor to consignee. There is indeed a likelihood of a conflict of interest between these parties. In this report we shall try to delineate the various problem areas, indicate the quantitative information that needs to be collected in order to decide how to solve these problems and outline an approach to such solutions...|$|R
40|$|Americium- 241 and {{plutonium}} determinations {{will become}} of greater importance over the coming decades as 137 Cs and 241 Pu decay. The impact of 137 Cs on environmental chronology has been great, but its potency is waning as it decays and diffuses. Having 241 Am and Pu as unequivocal markers for the 1963 weapon fallout maximum is important for short time scale environmental work, but a fast and reliable procedure is required for their separation. The developed method described here begins by digesting samples using a lithium borate fusion although an aqua regia leachate is also effective in many instances. Isolation of the Am and Pu is then achieved {{using a combination of}} extraction chromatography and conventional anion exchange chromatography. The whole procedure has been optimized, validated, and assessed for safety. The straightforwardness of this technique permits the analysis of large numbers of samples and makes 241 Am-based techniques for high-resolution sediment accumulation rate studies attractive. In addition, the technique can be employed for the sequential measurement of Pu and Am in environmental surveillance programs, potentially reducing analytical costs and <b>turn-round</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R
30|$|Airport delay {{computations}} {{are often}} construed to suit different definitions (Madas and Zografos 2008). Some definitions include aircraft <b>turn-round</b> <b>time,</b> whereas others exclude it. The problem is even larger when one desires to assess daily efficiency of an airport. Many {{studies have been}} conducted with the purpose of assessing efficiencies of operations at an airport. In their study of the factors for delays at European airports relative to the airports of the United States of America (Santos and Robin 2014) found that while delays were higher at hub airports, hub airlines experienced lower delays than non-hub airlines. A similar study (Liu et al. 2014) found that there was 30 Â % greater traffic at airports in the United States of America airports than at European airports that explained more delay at such airports. However, none of the studies considered optimal delay thresholds and its effect on drawing such important conclusions about levels and differences between airports. In his recent study (Wesonga 2015) published the first study that attempted to analyse delay thresholds at airport.|$|R
40|$|In the 'rice-wheat' and the 'cotton-wheat' farming {{systems of}} Pakistan's Punjab, late {{planting}} of wheat is a perennial problem due to often delayed harvesting {{of the previously}} planted and late maturing rice and cotton crops. This leaves very limited time for land preparation for 'on-time' planting of wheat. 'No-tillage' technologies that reduce the <b>turn-round</b> <b>time</b> for wheat cultivation after rice and cotton have been developed, but their uptake {{has not been as}} expected. -This paper attempts to determine the farm and farmer characteristics and other socio-economic factors that influence the adoption of 'no-tillage' technologies'. Logit models were developed for the analysis undertaken. In the 'cotton-wheat' system personal characteristics like education, tenancy status, attitude towards risk implied in the use of new technologies and contact with extension agents are the main factors that affect adoption. As regards the 'rice-wheat' system, resource endowments such as farm size, access to a 'no-tillage' drill, clayey soils and the area sown to the rice-wheat sequence along with tenancy and contact with extension agents were dominant in explaining adoption.

50|$|Economic {{liberalization}} of 1991 followed by Information Technology industry explosion have taken India {{to a new}} growth scenario. Backed by strong fundamentals and commendable growth {{in the past three}} to four years, the resplendent Indian Economy is poised to grow even further at an average of 8 to 10% in the next 3 years. Transport requirement in the country, being primarily a derived demand, is slated to increase with elasticity of 1.25 with GDP growth by 10 to 12% in the medium and long term range. Riding on the waves of economic success, Indian Railways has witnessed a dramatic turn around and unprecedented financial turnover in the last two and a half years. This has been made possible by higher freight volumes without substantial investment in infrastructure, increased axle load, reduction of <b>turn-round</b> <b>time</b> of rolling stock, reduced unit cost of transportation, rationalization of tariffs resulting in improvement in market share and improved operational margins. Over the last 2 to 3 years, the railway freight traffic has grown by 8 to 11%, which is projected to cross 1100 million tonnes by the end of 11th Five Year Plan.|$|R
40|$|It {{is unusual}} {{to find that}} housing {{refurbishment}} projects have been undertaken with a clear focus on customer orientation directed towards the tenants, or owners of cooperative flats or condominiums. Only recently have researchers in construction management begun to look closer at the relationship between contractors and customers. To assess the scope for customer orientation in the refurbishment industry, current thinking in service management is reviewed here {{in an attempt to}} identify principles with implications for housing refurbishment. There is a consensus among service management investigators that services are intangible; other often mentioned characteristics are heterogeneity, perishability, and the inseparability of production and consumption. Except for inseparability these characteristics are valid for refurbishment. Nevertheless, features such as the long <b>turn-round</b> <b>time,</b> the number of participants, the complexity and the uncertainty, distinguish housing refurbishment from most services. There is strong empirical support for the claim that customer satisfaction increases customer loyalty and gives the service producer a positive reputation, ultimately increasing profitability. It is concluded that this insight can be interpreted operationally for housing refurbishment projects, bearing in mind that the tenant or the owner of a cooperative flat is the customer's customer.

50|$|In 1948 the LMS was nationalised as British Railways, London Midland Region. Nationalisation greatly {{facilitated}} the modernisation of British Railways and, after a false start developing new improved steam engines, electrification came, along with diesel power and fixed-formation air-braked trains. These changes {{had a significant}} effect on Crewe station. Notably, the variation in station use caused firstly by the electrification in stages of the West Coast Main Line between 1959 and 1974 and secondly by the general end of steam traction on Britain's railways. Following the completion of electrification in 1974, trains did not need to change locomotives at Crewe, except for the London to Chester and Holyhead service. Many locomotive hauled trains were replaced by electric or diesel multiple unit trains, with much faster <b>turn-round</b> <b>times.</b> Additionally, two local branch lines had closed, which resulted in fewer trains terminating at Crewe. However, compensating for the decline of local passenger traffic, the reduction in mail and parcels traffic and the total elimination of livestock carriage, came the great increase in inter-city passenger traffic and the need for even faster, smoother and more efficient handling of passenger trains.|$|R
40|$|A {{computer-assisted}} {{model for}} diagnosing jaundice has been adapted {{for use on}} the University of London C. D. C. 7600 computer via an on-line terminal at King's College Hospital to provide a rapid <b>turn-round</b> <b>time.</b> The model was used prospectively in the diagnosis of 219 patients [...] 135 seen in a specialized liver unit and 84 seen in one of four district hospitals in south-east London [...] with an overall accuracy in distinguishing among 11 different causes of jaundice of 69 % and 62 % respectively. These figures rose to 77 % and 88 % respectively when only those patients in whom the final diagnosis reached a "certain" probability were considered. When used to distinguish between a medical and a surgical cause of jaundice the accuracy was 86 % in the liver unit and 77 % in the district hospitals, rising to 95 % in both series for those with a diagnosis of certain probability. The proposed improvements to the model [...] namely, the use of two deparate data bases and more diagnoses within the matrix [...] should be improve the accuracy even further.

40|$|A data {{processing}} system for the emergency laboratory was integrated in our clinical laboratory computer system, its prime objective being the service requirements of the laboratory. It included the possibility of simultaneous optical reading of request forms and on-line capturing, processing, and printing of laboratory test data. Priority request forms, which allow the clinician to specify the interval by which emergency test results must be available, are registered by an optical reader and arranged according to urgency by the computer. The production of worksheets is replaced by visual display of information required for accurate specimen analyses on a large colour TV screen. The individual processing status of all tests from as many as 30 request forms is displayed in a colour code. For process control the updated delay time for test performance is faded in. All reports are produced by direct machine transfer of verified test results. For security purposes all steps of sample processing (request, result, report) are recorded via line printers outside the emergency laboratory. The capacity of the computer for managing sample and {{data processing}} reduces the work load for technicians. This results in a reduction of the <b>turn-round</b> <b>time</b> of tests. 95 % of all requested tests are performed and reported within the requested time period and in emergencies, test results are available within 5 - 10 min. There has been no major breakdown of the system in over one year of use...|$|R
40|$|For the Large Hadron Collider under {{construction}} at CERN, an essential requirement is the acceptance test of its 1706 Cryo-magnets in cryogenic conditions in a purpose-built facility at CERN. Several teams ensure the proper {{operation of the}} infrastructure on a round the clock basis. The cold test part {{is one of the}} key elements amongst many other essential activities requiring magnet transport and connections/disconnections, cryogenic preparation and pumping, cooling down to 1. 9 K as well warm up before disconnection & removal. All these operations involve multi-tasking and usage of 12 test benches with nominal <b>turn-round</b> <b>time</b> per dipole magnet of 120 hours. It also involves multiple teams of industrial contractors, a support contract for cryogenics operation, CERN staff in magnet testing Operation, aided by a large external collaboration of visiting staff for round the clock operation.

It explains how the complexity and the volume of tests are managed in the most automated way by our control systems and web-based management tools, using backbone database applications helping the different operation teams to work together efficiently and in harmony to meet the tight tests schedule for the LHC...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{microfluidic}} devices transport fluids by {{a variety}} of physical means. Among them, pump-based and capillary-based fluid delivery systems are commonly adapted to move fluids. The pump-based systems intrinsically require sub systems consisting of mechanical and/or electrical instruments, which poses tremendous difficulties to system-level miniaturization. Herein, the investigations of two capillary-based microfluidic platforms are described. The first platform encapsulates biological reagents by capillary force in carefully designed microchannels, and detects biomolecules by moving magnetic beads in it. The second platform provides functional microfluidic devices made of paperâa fabric and abundant material that autonomously wicks fluids. Chapter 1 describes the development of the polymer-based platform, whereas Chapter 2 and 3 present the paper-based platform. ^ Specifically, Chapter 1 reports a the polymer-based microfluidic device for immuno-diagnostics. Rather than handling fluid reagents against a stationary solid phase, the platform manipulates analyte-coated magnetic beads through stationary plugs of fluid reagents to detect an antigenic analyte. These isolated but accessible plugs are pre-encapsulated in a microchannel by capillary force. We call this platform microfluidic inverse phase enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (Î¼IPELISA). Î¼IPELISA has distinctive advantages in the family of microfluidic immunoassay. In particular, it avoids pumping and valving fluid reagents during assaying, thus leading to a lab-on-a-chip format that is free of instrumentation for fluid actuation and control. We use Î¼IPELISA to detect digoxigenin-labeled DNA segments amplified from E. Coli O 157 :H 7 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and compare its detection capability with that of microplate ELISA. For 0. 259 ng per 2 Ì 6 mgr;Lâ 1 of digoxigenin-labeled amplicon, Î¼IPELISA is as responsive as the microplate ELISA. Also, we simultaneously conduct Î¼IPELISA in two parallel microchannels. ^ Chapter 2 reports a fluidic diode, valves and a circuit fabricated entirely on a single layer of paper to control wicking of fluids. Our fluidic diode is a two-terminal component that promotes or stops wicking along a paper channel. We further constructed a trigger valve and a delay valve based on the fluidic diode. Furthermore, we demonstrate a high-level functional circuit, consisted of a diode and a delay valve, to manipulate two fluids in a sequential manner. Our study provides new, transformative tools to manipulate fluid for microfluidic paper-based devices. ^ Chapter 3 reports the 3 D counterparts of the fluidic components described in the previous chapter. By using printing, stacking and taping, we create channels defined by wax contours in multilayer of paper to further reduce the footprints of microfluidic paper-based devices. This fabrication method is simple with a high yield: the channels are ready for assembling in minutes, and the typical <b>turn-round</b> <b>time</b> from a design to an end assembly is less than an hour. We believe these features are attractive for rapid prototyping of microfluidic paper-based devices. ...|$|R
