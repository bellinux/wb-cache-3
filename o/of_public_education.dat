This paper develops a new model <b>of</b> <b>public</b> school <b>education</b> and demonstrates how the presence of private tutoring in developing countries, compromises the above argument. The teachers, by shirking at school and supplying private tutoring to the students at a cost, divert the benefits <b>of</b> free <b>public</b> <b>education</b> towards themselves. This model also conforms with the merit-cum-means principle adopted in developing countries to subsidize the education of the poor and high ability students when it is extended to an heterogeneous environment. private tutoring, club, imperfect monitoring...|$|R
5|$|Due to ill health, Blackburn {{could not}} take {{an active part in}} the {{campaign}}. He sought relief from his ailments at Crab Orchard Springs, while much of the campaign oratory was delivered on his behalf by fellow Democrats Boyd Winchester, Parker Watkins Hardin, W. C. P. Breckinridge, and others. Republicans, who had nominated Walter Evans, had fewer speakers with which to canvass the state, and were at a decided disadvantage. Democrats attacked the administrations of Republican Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, cited the alleged abuses perpetrated in the South by Carpetbaggers and Scalawags, and leveled charges that Republicans favored capitalists over the state's working class. Republican orators, led by William O'Connell Bradley, charged Democrats with financial extravagance, citing a $3million surplus in the state treasury in 1865 compared with a $1million debt in 1878. Bradley claimed that Democrats had maintained their power in the state through gerrymandering election districts. He cited poor conditions at the state penitentiary and inadequate funding <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>education</b> as evidence of Democratic mismanagement of the state.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} specific relationship of federal economic {{policies of the}} Reagan administration, known as Reaganomics, to <b>public</b> higher <b>education.</b> In conducting this study three questions are asked: what were the economic policies of the Reagan administration; what was the impact on state finances of these policies; {{and what was the}} effect on access to <b>public</b> higher <b>education</b> <b>of</b> this impact on state finances?^ To answer these questions this dissertation studies the federal economic policies of the Reagan administration known as Reaganomics and their impact on state financing <b>of</b> <b>public</b> higher <b>education</b> during the period 1981 - 1992. ^ This study makes clear that Reaganomics was developed and implemented based on the faulty assumption that taxes could be cut, the needy protected, military spending increased and the budget balanced. The impact of these economic policies on state government finances was significant in two major ways: the substantial reduction in federal aid to state governments during the initial phase of the implementation of Reaganomics; and the transferring of responsibility for certain social services from the federal government to state governments, particularly in the Medicaid program. These changes in state finances {{had a significant impact on}} state funding <b>of</b> <b>public</b> higher <b>education</b> and access to these institutions. ^ The findings of this study have significant implications for the understanding of future state financing and accessibility <b>of</b> <b>public</b> higher <b>education</b> because they clearly establish the relationship between federal economic policies, state finances, state financing <b>of</b> <b>public</b> higher <b>education,</b> and access to <b>public</b> higher <b>education.</b> Because <b>of</b> these relationships it becomes clear that the future levels of state financing <b>of</b> <b>public</b> higher <b>education</b> and access to these institutions will depend greatly on the economic policies of the federal government. The dissertation concludes with an examination of the potential impact of the choices facing the Clinton administration on state financing <b>of</b> <b>public</b> higher <b>education.</b> ...|$|R
