5000|$|West Coast Choppers {{motorcycles}} {{are described}} as old school, and minimalist. [...] WCC bikes have been called more stripped down when contrasted with decades-long established chopper builders like Arlen Ness, that is, a bike with, [...] "not much there but engine, what the law requires, and something to hold onto." [...] In spite of this characterization, a WCC trademark {{is the use of}} 9×19mm and [...]44 Magnum shell casings as purely non-functional decorations, adorning the fuel or <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> or top of the motorcycle's handlebar risers, or elsewhere. The presence of this 20th-century gun ammunition is intended to evoke Jesse James' distant ancestor, old west outlaw and gunfighter Jesse James. [...] A strong metaphorical tie between the chopper-riding biker and old west outlaws is a mainstay of biker culture, established by [...] "the biker world's Norman Rockwell," [...] painter David Mann. [...] The biker's cross logo, a version of the Iron Cross or the Maltese Cross, is also typical of a WCC bike, though that symbol is nearly ubiquitous in Kustom Kulture regardless.|$|R

50|$|Tell-tale {{signs of}} such {{eventual}} related damage are a white foam that {{appears on the}} inside of the <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> and the gradually increasing loss of antifreeze coolant (due to seepage into the intake passages which will lead to engine lock up failure in such cases). External seepage is also found near the valley edge of the lower intake manifold. These engines are also known for problematic EGR Valves in which carbon build-up occurs very rapidly, therefore reducing gas mileage drastically, however without affecting the reliability of the engine.|$|E

50|$|Just past Siena, Marzotto {{remembered that}} the Ferrari {{mechanics}} did not change his engine oil at the last control point, as {{they were unable to}} open the bonnet.

50|$|In 1967 Ducati's {{successful}} 350 scrambler motor {{was selected}} {{for use in the}} new Swiss military motorcycle. At first plans were to just import the engine block but later plans were changed to import the whole engine, although there was some Swiss tinkering. The exhaust port and assembly was made more robust. The steel exhaust pipe and muffler were built to run almost silently and the whole assembly is sprayed with aluminum. The <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> changed to a longer tube to make filling easier. Compression was reduced to 8.2:1 so that the bike could run on poor quality gas. The result is a reliable engine that made only 16.6 hp, and it will do about 70 miles per hour. The oil filter was mounted remotely.|$|E

50|$|The early Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman {{cars had}} an {{internal}} fuel tank {{located on the}} left hand side of the rear load area. This is identifiable by the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> being on the left hand {{side of the car}} just below the rear window.In October 1961 the fuel tank was relocated to the underneath of the car and the <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> was moved to low down on the right hand side of the car - the same configuration that was already in use on the Mini Van.|$|R
40|$|This degree {{project was}} {{conducted}} in collaboration with Husqvarna AB, the headquarters of which are located in Jönköping. The aim was to further develop the <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> found on {{more or less the}} whole of the company’s range of chain saws, {{in order to make it}} more user friendly. The present <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> is not easy to open and close, especially when wearing gloves, and under difficult conditions, which creates problems and prolongs filling time. On the basis of market surveys, different prototypes and tests, we have created an ergonomically improved cap of a new shape, which can be moved in the axial direction, thus making filling easier...|$|R

50|$|The first {{refinement}} in {{crankcase ventilation}} was the road draft tube, {{which is a}} pipe running from a high location contiguous to the crankcase (such as {{the side of the}} engine block, or the valve cover on an overhead valve engine) down to an open end facing down and located in the vehicle's slipstream. When the vehicle is moving, airflow across the open end of the tube creates a draft that pulls gases out of the crankcase. The high location of the engine end of the pipe minimises liquid oil loss. An air inlet path to the crankcase, called the breather and often incorporated into the <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> <b>cap,</b> meant that when a draft was generated at the tube, fresh air swept through the crankcase to clear out the blow-by gases.|$|E
50|$|The {{condition}} {{of a head}} gasket is typically investigated by checking the compression pressure with a pressure gauge, or better, a leak-down test, and/or noting any indication of combustion gases in the cooling system on a water-cooled engine. Oil mixed with coolant and excessive coolant loss with no apparent cause, or presence of carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon gases in the expansion tank of the cooling system can also be signs of head gasket problems. A good sign of head gasket failure on water-cooled engines {{is the presence of}} a substance that resembles mayonnaise in the oil, often to be seen on the dipstick, or <b>oil</b> <b>filler</b> <b>cap.</b> However, the presence of this substance is not conclusive proof of head gasket failure, since oil could mix with the coolant via other routes.|$|E

40|$|A {{facility}} and expertise {{has been developed}} at NAL to conduct automated internal pressure cycling tests. The hardware and instrumentation includes capturing {{of pressure on the}} data logger along with strain gage data. Digital data can be recorded continuously during entire pressure cycle, thus enabling to provide comparative view of reduction in stiffness, if any,in terms of graphs. The Maximum Pressure up To Which the Central Shells Could Be Tested Was 188. 5 psi. A Maximum Strain Of 5166 Micro Strains, At A Pressure Of 188. 5 psi, Was Found Near The GFRP Bulkhead In The Circumferential Direction. The Integrity Of The Bulkhead Joint Appears Satisfactory. The Nose-Cone, Tested For Internal Pressure Cycling Between 3 And L Lpsi Did Not Show Any Leaks Anywhere On The Surface Or From The <b>Filler</b> <b>Cap.</b> However, After 1104 Pressure Cycles,The End Flange Failed With A Loud Pop. On Inspection, It Was Found That The Failure Is Due To Improper Adhesion Between The GFRP Base Material And The Aluminum Ring Holding The End-Flange. Subsequently, This Ring Was Joined To The GFRP Shell By Bolts And The Pressure Cycling Was Continued For A Further 5000 Cycles,As Required, Without Any Failure/Leaks Anywhere On The Nose Cone. The Nose Cone Was Then Subjected To A Steadily Increasing Pressure To Verify The Residual Strength. At About 60 psi, Leaks Were Observed Around The <b>Filler</b> <b>Cap</b> And The Pressure Was Continued Up To 85 psi. At This Pressure, The <b>Filler</b> <b>Cap</b> Seal Gave-Up And A Profuse Leak Sprouted Around The Cap This Was Verified Again By Replacing The <b>Filler</b> <b>Cap</b> With A New One That Also Failed Completely At About 85 psi Pressure. Presently,It May Be Concluded That The Lca s Gfrp Drop Tank Internal Bulkheads Of Central Shell Can Withstand A Pressure Of 185 psi And The Weak Link,In The DT Assembly, Is The <b>Filler</b> <b>Cap</b> Seal That Can Stand A Pressure Of Only 60 psi. ...|$|R

5000|$|The Explorer Sport Trac was {{introduced}} in February 2000 as a 2001 model. It was built on a lengthened Explorer chassis, but with a small pickup bed behind the four normal SUV doors. To {{make up for the}} short box, a bed extender was available. The bed was made entirely of a plastic composite material, and a hard plastic tonneau cover was a common factory option. The tailgate was carried over from the F-150 Flare Side. The pickup had a more rugged-appearing front end, which the 2-door Explorer Sport also received. The dash and front cabin area were nearly identical to the Ranger, while the exterior used Explorer parts. Midway through the 2001 model year, the engine design was changed. The [...] "Job 1" [...] 4.0L SOHC featured an alloy intake manifold.
