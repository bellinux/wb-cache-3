We examine how two methods of limiting foreign tax credits, separate limitations based on type or source of income or an <b>overall</b> <b>limitation</b> aggregating across all foreign income, affect the optimal allocation of capital. We show that when investment opportunities exist in both low-tax and high-tax countries, a separate limitation method will always result in an inefficient allocation of capital.

The Temporal Modulation Transfer Function (TMTF) indicates {{the relation between the}} just noticeable degree of modulation and the modulation rate. It is generally thought that the shape of the TMTF reflects an <b>overall</b> <b>limitation</b> of the auditory system to resolve fast fluctuations. A stimulus aspect to which we wifi pay some attention is the influence of the carrier type, which is usually either a broadband noise or a sinusoid. Specific differences in modulation detection for noise and for sinusoidal carriers indicate that TMTFs for these two carrier types might reveal different aspects of the auditory system and might not reflect the same process of temporal limitation. A multi-channel detection model including a modulation filterbank is described which does predict modulation detection data for random-noise carriers for many different conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. As {{processor}} speeds rapidly {{approach the}} Giga-Hertz regime, {{the disparity between}} process time and memory access time plays an increasing role in the <b>overall</b> <b>limitation</b> of processor performance. In addition, limitations in interconnect density and bandwidth serve to exacerbate current bottlenecks, particularly as computer architectures continue to reduce in size. To address these issues, we propose a 3 D architecture based on through-wafer vertical optical interconnects. To facilitate integration into the current manufacturing infrastructure, our system is monolithically fabricated in the Silicon substrate and preserves scale of integration by using meso-scopic diffractive optical elements (DOEs) for beam routing and fan-out. We believe that this architecture can alleviate the disparity between processor speeds and memory access times while increasing interconnect density by at least an order of magnitude. We are currently working to demonstrate a prototype system that consists of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs), diffractive optical elements, photodetectors, and processor-in-memory (PIM) units integrated on a single silicon substrate. To this end, we are currently refining our fabrication and design methods for the realization of meso-scopic DOEs and their integration with active devices. In this paper, we present our progress to date and demonstrate vertical data transmission using DOEs and discuss the application for our architecture, which is a multi-PIM (MPM) system...|$|E

It is argued that favourable attitudes toward social entrepreneurship are determinants of successful social entrepreneurship that could contribute to sustainable socio-economic development amongst the youth who are still grappling with the “triple challenge” of unemployment, poverty and inequality. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to describe the attitudes of urban youth toward social entrepreneurship and to identify the constraints that the youth perceive as barriers to engaging in social entrepreneurship. The data of this study was from a survey conducted in Diepsloot, North of Johannesburg involving 153 young people. Data was collected using two self-rating questionnaires. The Social Entrepreneurial Intent Scale (SEIS), adopted from Thompson (2009), was used to measure social entrepreneurial intentions, while the Constraint scale developed by Fatoki and Chindoga (2011) was used to identify constraints. The study produced three main findings. Firstly, the majority of respondents had positive attitudes towards starting and engaging in social enterprises. Secondly, the research identified three main constraints that discourage the youth from starting or engaging in social enterprise, namely “lack of access to finance”, “lack of savings to start”, and “weak economic environment”. Thirdly, the research also identified an <b>overall</b> <b>limitation</b> to social entrepreneurship, namely; lack of support.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} {{with some of the}} limitations concerned with the imaging properties of astronomical telescopes of large apertures. These arise from the atmosphere, the diffracting aperture, the residual errors in the optically worked surfaces and the characteristics of the detection devices. Methods of Fourier optics are used to determine modulation transfer functions and associated point spread function. They are applied to three problems. The first of these is a comparison of the diffraction patterns that are expected from the multi-mirror telescopes. These are made either of separated individual mirrors or of segmented mirrors shaped to an overall parabolic shape. The effect of the dilution of the aperture in the former and the effect of misalignment in the latter is investigated. In the second study, the factors contributing to the imaging of the UK Schmidt telescope are considered and design studies of this and other two variants are examined.

40|$|In {{the world}} of Web pages, there are oceans of {{documents}} in natural language texts and tables. To extract rules from Web pages and maintain consistency between them, we have developed the framework of XRML (eXtensible Rule Markup Language). XRML allows the identification of rules on Web pages and generates the identified rules automatically. For this purpose, we have designed the Rule Identification Markup Language (RIML), {{which is similar to}} the formal Rule Structure Markup Language (RSML), both as parts of XRML. RIML 2. 0 is designed to identify rules not only from texts, but also from tables on Web pages, and to transform to the formal rules in RSML syntax automatically. While designing RIML 2. 0, we considered the features of sharing variables and values, omitted terms, and synonyms. We have conducted an experiment to evaluate the potential benefit of the XRML approach with real world Web pages of Amazon. com, BarnesandNoble. com, and Powells. com. We found that 100. 0 % of the rules and 99. 7 % of the rule components could be identified and automatically generated if we do not count the statements for linkages, which generically do not exist on the Web pages.

40|$|Cancer {{cells have}} an {{increased}} demand for amino acids and require transport even of non-essential amino acids to support their increased proliferation rate. Besides their major role as protein synthesis precursors, the two proteinogenic sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine and cysteine, play specific biological functions. In humans, methionine is essential for cell growth and development and may act as a precursor for cysteine synthesis. Cysteine is a precursor for the biosynthesis of glutathione, the major scavenger for reactive oxygen species. We study the effect of K-ras oncogene activation in NIH 3 T 3 mouse fibroblasts on transport and metabolism of cysteine and methionine. We show that cysteine limitation and deprivation cause apoptotic cell death (cytotoxic effect) in both normal and K-ras-transformed fibroblasts, due to accumulation of reactive oxygen species {{and a decrease in}} reduced glutathione. Anti-oxidants glutathione and MitoTEMPO inhibit apoptosis, but only cysteine-containing glutathione partially rescues the cell growth defect induced by limiting cysteine. Methionine limitation and deprivation has a cytostatic effect on mouse fibroblasts, unaffected by glutathione. K-ras-transformed cells-but not their parental NIH 3 T 3 -are extremely sensitive to methionine limitation. This fragility correlates with decreased expression of the Slc 6 a 15 gene-encoding the nutrient transporter SBAT 1, known to exhibit a strong preference for methionine-and decreased methionine uptake. <b>Overall,</b> <b>limitation</b> of sulfur-containing amino acids results in a more dramatic perturbation of the oxido-reductive balance in K-ras-transformed cells compared to NIH 3 T 3 cells.

40|$|Abstract. Plant {{species with}} longer leaf {{longevity}} tend to maintain lower photosynthetic rates. Among other factors, differences in stomatal limitation {{have been proposed}} to explain {{the negative effects of}} leaf longevity on photosynthesis, although it is not yet clear why stomatal limitations should be stronger in species with longer leaf longevity. We measured carbon isotopic composition (d 13 C) in the fresh leaf litter of several Mediterranean woody species to estimate the mean stomatal limitations during the photosynthetically active part of the leaf life. Interspecific differences in d 13 C were best explained by a multiple regression including, as independent variables, the maximum leaf longevity and the annual water deficit. For a similar level of water availability, stomatal limitations were higher in species with longer leaf longevity. We hypothesise that stronger stomatal control of transpiration in longer-living leaves arose as a mechanism {{to reduce the risk of}} leaf desiccation and to avoid the high costs for the futureC assimilation of anticipated leafmortality in specieswith a long leaf life expectancy. This stronger sensitivity to drought should be added to the suite of traits accompanying long leaf longevity and contributes decisively to the <b>overall</b> <b>limitations</b> to C assimilation in long-lived leaves...|$|R
40|$|Background: Postoperative {{nausea and}} {{vomiting}} {{as well as}} postoperative pain are two major concerns when patients undergo surgery and receive anesthetics. Various models and predictive methods {{have been developed to}} investigate the risk factors of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and different types of preventive managements have subsequently been developed. However, there continues to be a wide variation in the previously reported incidence rates of postoperative nausea and vomiting. This may have occurred because patients were assessed at different time points, coupled with the <b>overall</b> <b>limitation</b> of the statistical methods used. However, using survival analysis with Cox regression, and thus factoring in these time effects, may solve this statistical limitation and reveal risk factors related to the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in the following period. Methods: In this retrospective, observational, uni-institutional study, we analyzed the results of 229 patients who received patient-controlled epidural analgesia following surgery from June 2007 to December 2007. We investigated the risk factors for the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and also assessed the effect of evaluating patients at different time points using the Cox proportional hazards model. Furthermore, the results of this inquiry were compared with those results using logistic regression. Results: The overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in our study was 35. 4 %. Using logistic regression, we found that only sex, but not the total doses and the average dose of opioids, had significant effects on the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting at some time points. Cox regression showed that, when patients consumed a higher average dose of opioids, this correlated with a higher incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting with a hazard ratio of 1. 286. Conclusion: Survival analysis using Cox regression showed that the average consumption of opioids {{played an important role in}} postoperative nausea and vomiting, a result not found by logistic regression. Therefore, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients cannot be reliably determined on the basis of a single visit at one point in time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper aims to {{investigate}} and answer two questions. Firstly, the impact made by four chosen determinants of initial public offering (IPO) prices in emerging markets and the variation effects of these determinants across emerging markets. The chosen determinants are net profit margin, net {{book value per share}}, cash flows and gearing. A database of 131 IPO made after the year 2000 in India, South Africa China Turkey and Russia are considered in this study. The study revealed that on an overall basis, when all countries were considered together, all four determinants had a positive correlation with IPO price, however only cash flow and net book value per share showed are fairly significant correlation. When the data in each country was considered separately I found contrasting results amongst them. I found that from the determinants that were chosen, cash flow and netbook value has a reasonable impact on offer price, however gearing and net profit are not such good indicators of IPO offer price in these markets. However, an <b>overall</b> <b>limitation</b> of our study was that the impact of external factors on IPO prices was not considered. External factors could significantly alter the correlation that four chosen variables have on the offer price. Second question that is addressed in this paper is the internal risks that companies under go when going public. I have chosen ten companies from the Indian market which have gone public in 2010 and selected three internal risks faced by these companies which are, risks of promoters acquiring controlling interest of the company, risk of companies having negative cash flows and profits prior to going public and risk of not having a trading history. I have analysed how companies have dealt with the principle agent problem when the company is acquired by the promoters and further have discussed how the companies have performed despite the negative earnings and cash flows and I also found that the risk of failing to increase the financial performance of these companies are reflected on the performance of the shares of the company. Further I can find that companies which have had higher subscription rates for the IPO’s have managed to control the risk of not having a previous trading history, thereby having a higher first day closing price than the initial offer price...|$|E

One way can be to use alternative visualization programs and file formats to the governing modeling tools and formats that are used today at the company. The purpose of this thesis work is to map out, investigate and evaluate the need for visualization of CAD information in the design process at Volvo Aero. To investigate if there are any other ways for people with no or low CAD experience to access and work with 2 D and 3 D geometry information. Evaluate what programs and formats {{that could be used for}} these purposes, and what the opportunities could be for the company. In order to fulfil the purpose extra effort has been put in to find the “real” needs among the personnel at Volvo Aero through personal interviews. Furthermore benchmarking against other companies has been conducted. Investigations and evaluations of different visualization tools and file formats with regards of fulfilling the needs found has been done. But also other aspects have been investigated for supporting the evaluation. The result found is that the need in using alternative programs and formats for 2 D and 3 D viewing purposes is a fact today at Volvo Aero, and the number of users that requires viewing capacity of the already created geometry model information is numerous. Although no supporting visualization tool has yet been implemented at the company. The obscurity in what visualization tool that can be adoptable were the governing geometry modeling tool is used today, and what formats to be used for this purposes has been the <b>overall</b> <b>limitation</b> for the implementation. The conclusion of the thesis is that three visualization programs, Visualization Mockup, Visualization Professional and SAP R/ 3 viewer, and the light weight file formats CGM for 2 D and JT for 3 D are the ones facilitating the needs found the best, and suggested for Volvo Aero to use. An implementation of the suggested visualization programs a lightweighted file formats will probably convey in many positive results at Volvo Aero. Not only that all personnel can have access to the geometry information created and increase the understanding, but also a step towards a more virtual process of development. An increased usage of 3 D information created by designers would probably speed up the process of development, result in more effective engineering work and reduce costs for unnecessary work.

40|$|The {{importance}} of learning about National {{history has been}} well recognised and has led to public debate about the content and {{how it should be}} presented to students. A perceived lack of student engagement with history has led to suggestions that a change in classroom pedagogy from teacher to student-centred activities is warranted. This study investigated the research problem of defining design principles to assist teachers in motivating and engaging students in the study of Australian History through the use of technology to support authentic tasks. The study employed a design-based research (DBR) approach to investigate how an authentic task that involved students utilising a web site resource to research the story of a WW 1 soldier, could engage and motivate high school History students. The intervention was implemented with Year 9 students in an Australian regional high school. The investigation examined the design principles, student processes and the teacher’s role in the delivery and completion of a student-centred, technology-based, authentic task. The study involved three iterative cycles of investigation during a period of three consecutive years at the same school with different students and teachers being involved each year. The study was conducted using qualitative methods within a design-based research framework. The sources of data were classroom observations and post-activity structured interviews with teachers and representative samples of students. The data collected was analysed using a constant comparative method to determine themes and issues related to the implemented solution. Three questions guided the investigation. (1) What are the critical principles applicable to the design of a technology-based authentic task, which will interest motivate and engage students in the study of Australian History? (2) What processes do students engage in when completing an authentic historical task using a technology-based learning resource? (3) How do teachers facilitate the use of a complex and sustained technology-based task in their history classes and what is their perception of improved learning outcomes for students? This study showed that authentic activities can motivate and engage students when learning about Australian History. The motivation and engagement of students was consistent across the three iterations despite the differing circumstances applying in each classroom situation. Eleven Design Principles to guide educators in planning authentic activities were derived from this research and are listed as follows: 1. Authentic activities with real-world relevance, and/or involving personal aspects of real people, lead to student engagement. 2. Authentic activities are complex, ill-defined tasks requiring investigation over a significant period of time. 3. “Authentic activities provide the opportunity for students to examine the task from different perspectives, using a variety of resources” (Reeves, Herrington, 2 ̆ 6 Oliver, 2002, p. 564). 4. Authentic activities provide the opportunity to collaborate with others, even when working on individual tasks. 5. “Authentic activities provide the opportunity to reflect” (Reeves et al., 2002, p. 564). 6. Authentic activities require students to employ a range of different skills. 7. Authentic activities create worthwhile, complete products. 8. “Authentic activities are seamlessly integrated with assessment” (Reeves et al., 2002, p. 564). 9. “Authentic activities allow competing solutions and diversity of outcome” (Reeves et al., 2002, p. 564). 10. Authentic activities require structured and documented support. 11. Authentic activities require access to teacher support. An <b>overall</b> <b>limitation</b> to this study is that it involved one school and one year group across multiple years, thus the draft design principles derived will need further examination in other school contexts. Furthermore, there was no detailed analysis of assessment artefacts produced by the students to make a judgement {{on the quality of the}} ‘learning’ that had occurred, thus future studies could consider this. The significant practical benefit derived from this DBR study to the school and the wider educational community was in the form of a student-centred unit of work focusing on the personal experiences of individual soldiers in World War One (WW 1) which is now an important component of the school’s History curriculum...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{conducted}} {{within the scope}} of a graduation fellowship from the state of Baden-Württemberg, Germany (Grant No. : VI 4. 2 - 7631. 2 /Baumann) in cooperation with the Depart-ment of Ecology, Peking University, Beijing. Scientists specialised in both ecology and soil science investigated the same sites, thus allowing an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate soil properties, C and N cycles as well as geomorphological processes in close connection to ecosys-tem interrelations on the Tibetan Plateau. The research sites are located along a 1, 200 km long north-south transect at altitudes between 2, 925 and 5, 105 m ASL. Two thirds of the Tibetan Plateau is influenced by permafrost. Due to the high sensitivity to global climate warming and land use changes, permafrost degradation processes are widespread, increasing the heterogeneity of soil formation, soil hydrology, and related soil chemical processes (i. e. C and N cycling). In order to account for the resulting extremely diverse ecosystem, investigations at different spatial scales related to large-scale climate patterns were performed. The scales comprise the total main transect, the split transect into an eastern and western section, diverse catenas along distinct geomorphological relief units, and finally the single site soil profiles. The first part of this work examines C and N contents as well as portions of plant available min-eralised nitrogen in relation to their main influencing parameters. For investigations on land-scape scale, soil moisture was found to have the strongest effect on C and N cycling, followed by CaCO 3 -content and soil texture. Altogether, the general linear model explains 64 % and 60 % of the variation of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (NT) contents, respectively. Thereby, two aspects are important: (1) temperature variables have no significant influence and (2) indicators for soil development (i. e. CaCO 3 and soil texture) are included besides commonly con-sidered ecological (i. e. moisture, temperature and biomass) parameters. It could be shown that in the highly diverse permafrost-affected ecosystem of the Tibetan Plateau, other factors than precipitation mainly control soil moisture contents and distribution, with permafrost and relief position being the most dominant parameters. Since pedogenic parameters turned out to be important predictors, the degree of soil development can be regarded as an additional control quantity, indicating higher C and N contents of topsoils with longer duration of undisturbed and stable soil development. Mineralised plant available N can be almost exclusively found as am-monium-N, which is closely related to higher soil moisture contents and frigid climate condi-tions, showing by far the highest contents in the permafrost main soil group. As nitrification is strongly temperature dependent, nitrate-N contents are correspondingly very low. The results provide clear evidence that limitation in plant available nutrients as a negative feedback to lower soil moisture is crucial for plant growth in nutrient-limited alpine grassland ecosystems, even though higher temperatures occur with respect to climate warming. Importantly, these strong feedback mechanisms between altering permafrost conditions (degradation and higher active layer thickness) and hence reverse influence of rising temperatures (further decay of permafrost and related dryer conditions) could be only detected by conducting this study on landscape scale. These dependencies are based on the <b>overall</b> <b>limitation</b> of moisture, because evaporation exceeds precipitation by far at all investigated sites. Degraded permafrost profiles show low C and N contents combined with distinct depth patterns, mainly caused by higher mineralisation rates and deposition of proximal airborne sediments. This is can be exemplarily shown for the Shule River basin located at the very north-eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, where soils under desert-type vegetation have their highest SOC density in soil depths between 20 and 40 cm, but not in the top 20 cm as evident for all other vegetation types. The main reason for these patterns are most likely such syngenetic soil forming processes. Results of soil respiration measurements basically confirm the findings observed for C and N contents. Belowground biomass and soil moisture explain 82 % of the variation, whereas no direct effects of temperature could be described. Respiration values of alpine meadows were 2. 5 times higher than of alpine steppes, which is a consequence of higher biomass and productivity in alpine meadows. Besides the relations to control variables, SOC was further analysed with regard to its stocks and composition. The comparison of two main investigation sites for discontinuous and continuous permafrost, respectively, clearly shows higher SOC stocks for discontinuous (10. 4 kg m- 2) than for continuous permafrost (3. 4 kg m- 2). Highest values occur at water-saturated profiles (19. 3 kg m- 2), causing positive feedbacks to even higher SOC accumulation, if in turn denser vegetation isolates the soil. At the same time, these soils contain substantial higher portions of easily de-composable particulate organic matter fractions, which are especially vulnerable to climate change owing to shorter turnover rates. The colder and dryer climate in continuous permafrost areas leads to a lower productivity and an allocation of belowground biomass mainly in the top 10 cm. This can be approved by studies conducted in the Shule River basin, also characterised by low mean annual temperature and precipitation, showing average SOC stocks of 7. 7 kg m- 2. Moreover, different vegetation types can be distinguished very clearly, ranging from 4. 4 kg m- 2 under desert vegetation to 19. 8 kg m- 2 under partly water-saturated alpine swamp meadow (cf. above-mentioned corresponding respiration rates related to vegetation type patterns). Moreover, it could be shown that soil inorganic carbon (SIC) and SOC are influenced by different parameter sets. Whereas soil physical and chemical properties are most appropriate to describe SIC, biotic and climatic factors are more important for SOC. Soil pH was found to predict 42 % of SIC variation, leading to lower contents with decreasing pH. However, the overall effect of the released carbon under scenarios of potential soil acidification is assumed to be compensated, since SOC reacts vice versa to increased soil acidity. Since pedological processes proved to have significant influence on C and N contents, it is im-portant to specifically qualify related weathering and sedimentation processes depending on the state of permafrost as well as land surface stability. To address this issue, weathering indices and pedogenic Fe-oxides were applied to particular sampling groups, distinctly influenced by the Indian and Asian Monsoon systems. The chemical index of alteration (CIA) represents the most useful weathering index, best describing large scale climate trends, varieties of substrates, and specific permafrost patterns. For pedogenic Fe-oxides, (Fed-Feo) /Fet ratio best illustrates small-scale shifts of pedogenesis. This can be confirmed by the differentiability of the main soil groups, which cannot be obtained by CIA. Essentially, groundwater and permafrost influenced soils can be clearly distinguished by distinct parameter sets best explaining each soil group: climate pa-rameters for the permafrost soil group (climate-zonal soil formation), and site-specific variables for groundwater-influenced soils (azonal soil formation). Moreover, the two soil groups can be significantly differentiated by Fep, even though both show high soil moisture and SOC contents. Therefore it can be assumed, that particular redoxi-morphic and soil formation processes with corresponding soil organic matter structures evolve under the influence of permafrost. Alto-gether, the application at various spatial scales give strong evidence that weathering indices and pedogenic Fe-oxides are useful tools to depict states of permafrost distribution and its degrada-tion features. Summarising, the described geochemical patchwork (manuscripts 1 - 5) can be disentangled by applying weathering indices and pedogenic oxides ratios, depending on the scale and process. Together with the evaluation of the prevailing main influencing parameters, they proved to be crucial for assessing C and N cycles and ecosystem functioning on the Tibetan Plateau. Die vorliegende Arbeit wurde im Rahmen eines Stipendiums der Landesgraduiertenförderung Baden-Württemberg (Förderungs-Nr. : VI 4. 2 - 7631. 2 /Baumann) in Zusammenarbeit mit der Fakultät für Ökologie der Peking University erstellt. Somit waren interdisziplinäre Untersuchun-gen von Bodeneigenschaften, C- und N-Kreislauf, geomorphologischen Prozessen sowie die di-rekte Analyse der Wechselbeziehungen dieser Parameter zum Gesamtökosystem des Tibetischen Hochplateaus möglich. Die Forschungsstandorte liegen entlang eines 1200 km langen nord-süd verlaufenden Transekts in Höhen zwischen 2925 und 5105 m ü. NN. Ungefähr zwei Drittel des Tibetischen Hochplateaus sind durch Permafrost beeinflusst und entsprechend besonders empfindlich im Hinblick auf Klimawandel und Landnutzungswechsel. Folglich sind häufig großräumige Degradationsprozesse zu beobachten. Dies führt zu einer steigenden Heterogenität der Bodenbildung, Bodenhydrologie und nachgeordneten bodenchemischen Prozessen, deren wichtigster Bestandteil der C- und N-Kreislauf ist. Um dem resultierenden, extrem diversen Ökosystem in seiner gesamten Breite gerecht zu werden, wurden Analysen auf verschiedenen räumlichen Maßstabsebenen entlang von Klimagradienten durchgeführt. Die Maßstabsebenen umfassen den gesamten Haupttransekt, einen östlichen und westlichen Teiltransekt, diverse Catenen entlang bestimmter geomorphologischer Reliefeinheiten und die Einzelstandorte. Zunächst wurden C- und N-Gehalte sowie die Anteile pflanzenverfügbaren Stickstoffs in Verbin-dung mit deren Haupteinflussparametern untersucht. Auf Landschaftsebene hat Bodenfeuchte den größten Einfluss auf die C- und N-Gehalte, gefolgt von CaCO 3 und der Korngrößenverteilung. Insgesamt erklärt das lineare Regressionsmodell 64 % der Variation von organischen Bodenkoh-lenstoffgehalten (SOC) und 60 % in Bezug auf den Gesamtstickstoff (TN). Dabei ist zweierlei maßgeblich: (1) Temperaturvariablen haben keinen signifikanten Einfluss, während (2) Indika-toren der Bodengenese, wie CaCO 3 -Gehalt und Korngrößenverteilung neben herkömmlichen ökologischen Variablen, wie beispielsweise Feuchtigkeitsparameter oder Biomasse, in das Re-gressionsmodell aufgenommen werden. Entsprechend wird in den hoch komplexen, periglazial geprägten Ökosystemen des Tibetischen Hochplateaus die Bodenfeuchteverteilung nicht direkt durch den Niederschlag, sondern vielmehr durch die auf indirektem Wege agierenden Parameter Reliefposition und Permafrost kontrolliert. Da sich bodenkundliche Einflussgrößen als wichtige Prädiktoren herausgestellt haben, kann der Grad der Bodenentwicklung allgemein als eine zusätzliche Stellgröße betrachtet werden: Je länger eine ungestörte und stabile Pedogenese vor-liegt, desto höhere C- und N-Gehalte sind zu beobachten. Dies betrifft auch den mineralisierten pflanzenverfügbaren Stickstoff, der fast ausschließlich als Ammonium-N vorliegt, was wiederum eng an erhöhte Bodenfeuchte und kühle Klimaverhältnisse geknüpft ist. Dabei treten die mit Abstand höchsten Werte in der Hauptbodengruppe „Permafrost“ auf. Entsprechend weist Nitrat-N sehr geringe Gehalte auf, da Nitrifikationsprozesse stark temperaturabhängig sind. Die Ergeb-nisse liefern einen klaren Nachweis dafür, dass eine Limitierung pflanzenverfügbarer Nährstoffe als negative Rückkopplung aufgrund geringerer Bodenfeuchtewerte trotz potenziell steigender Temperaturen im Hinblick auf die globale Erwärmung hervorgerufen werden kann. Die ausge-prägten Rückkopplungsmechanismen zwischen Veränderungen des Permafrosts (Degradations-prozesse und größere Mächtigkeit des Active Layers) und infolgedessen eines umgekehrten Ein-flusses steigender Temperatur (weiterer Rückgang von Permafrost und damit verbundene tro-ckenere Bedingungen) konnten ausschließlich aufgrund des gewählten Maßstabs auf Land-schaftsebene ermittelt werden. Diese Abhängigkeiten basieren auf der negativen Feuchtigkeits-bilanz des Untersuchungsgebietes, da die Evaporation bei weitem die Niederschlagswerte über-steigt. Die niedrigen C- und N-Gehalte sowie die spezifische Tiefenverteilung an degradierten Standorten sind hauptsächlich auf höhere Mineralisationsraten und die Ablagerung von proximal generierten äolischen Sedimenten zurückzuführen. Dies kann exemplarisch für das Einzugsgebiet des Shule River am nordöstlichen Rand des Tibetischen Hochplateaus aufgezeigt werden, wo Böden unter Wüstenvegetation nicht wie alle anderen Vegetationstypen die höchsten SOC-Gehalte in den ersten 20 cm, sondern vielmehr in Bodentiefen zwischen 20 und 40 cm aufweisen. Hauptgrund hierfür sind ebendiese synsedimentären Bodenbildungen. Ergebnisse von Bo-denrespirationsmessungen bestätigen grundsätzlich die für C und N-Gehalte gemachten Be-obachtungen. Unterirdische Biomasse und Bodenfeuchte erklären 82 % der Gesamtvariation, wobei kein direkter Einfluss von Temperatur nachgewiesen werden konnte. Die Bodenrespira-tion alpiner Matten übersteigt aufgrund der höheren Biomasse und Produktivität die von alpiner Steppenvegetation um das 2, 5 -fache. Neben den Beziehungen mit Kontrollvariablen wurde SOC zusätzlich im Hinblick auf Vorräte und Zusammensetzung untersucht. Der Vergleich zwischen den Hauptuntersuchungsstandorten erbrachte deutlich höhere SOC-Vorräte für diskontinuierlichen Permafrost (10. 4 kg m- 2), wäh-rend im kontinuierlichen Permafrost lediglich durchschnittlich 3. 4 kg m- 2 ermittelt wurden. Höchste Vorräte finden sich in wassergesättigten Profilen (19. 3 kg m- 2), da die Isolationswirkung der dichteren Vegetation einen positiven Rückkopplungsmechanismus auslösen und zu einer weiteren Akkumulation von SOC führen kann. Gleichzeitig enthalten diese Böden im Bereich des diskontinuierlichen Permafrosts höhere Anteile an vergleichsweise leicht abbaubaren Fraktionen partikulärer organischer Substanz, die entsprechend anfällig auf Klimaveränderungen reagiert. Die kühleren und trockeneren Verhältnisse im Bereich des kontinuierlichen Permafrosts führen hingegen zu einer geringeren Produktivität und einer schwerpunktmäßigen Verteilung der unterirdischen Biomasse in den obersten 10 cm. Dies kann zusätzlich durch Untersuchungen im ebenfalls durch niedrige Jahresdurchschnittstemperaturen und Niederschlägen geprägten Einzugsgebiet des Shule River nachgewiesen werden. Hier finden sich durchschnittliche SOC-Vorräte von 7. 7 kg m- 2, die je nach Vegetationseinheit zwischen 4. 4 kg m- 2 unter Wüstenvegeta-tion und 19. 8 kg m- 2 unter wassergesättigten alpinen Sumpfmatten variieren (vgl. oben be-schriebene Respirationswerte in Bezug auf verschiedene Vegetationsmuster). Ferner konnte gezeigt werden, dass anorganischer Kohlenstoff (SIC) und SOC durch unter-schiedliche Parametersets beeinflusst werden: Bodenphysikalische und bodenchemische Eigen-schaften beschreiben SIC am besten, während biotische und klimatische Faktoren für SOC rele-vanter sind. Ein niedrigerer pH-Wert führt demnach zu geringeren SIC-Gehalten und erklärt 42 % der Variation. Jedoch kann im Hinblick auf potentielle Bodenversauerung die Kohlen-stofffreisetzung aufgrund der umgekehrten Reaktion von SOC kompensiert werden. Da ein signifikanter Einfluss bodenbildender Prozesse auf C- und N-Gehalte nachgewiesen wer-den konnte, ist es notwendig damit verbundene Verwitterungs- und Sedimentationsprozesse in Bezug auf Permafrostverteilung und Oberflächenstabilität zu analysieren. Hierfür wurden Ver-witterungsindizes und pedogene Fe-Oxide auf verschiedenen Maßstabsebenen und Untergruppen in Bezug auf spezifische klimatische Verhältnisse angewendet. Der „chemical index of alteration“ (CIA) eignet sich dabei am besten um großräumige Klimatrends, Substratunterschiede und spezifische Permafrostverteilungsmuster zu beschreiben. Dagegen zeigen Quotienten pedogener Fe-Oxide kleinräumige bodengenetische Wechsel an, wofür sich vorzugsweise (Fed-Feo) /Fet bewährt hat. Dies kann durch die klare Differenzierbarkeit von Hauptbodengruppen, die durch den CIA nicht möglich ist, untermauert werden. Dabei ist wesentlich, dass Böden, die durch Grundwasser und Permafrost beeinflusst sind, klar zu unterscheiden sind. Klimaparameter haben innerhalb der Hauptbodengruppe „Permafrost“ das größte Gewicht (klimazonale Bodenbildung), während standortspezifische Variablen den Haupteinfluss innerhalb von Grundwasser geprägten Böden aufweisen (azonale Bodenbildung). Zusätzlich können diese Bodengruppen statistisch signifikant durch Fep unterschieden werden, obwohl sie ähnlichen SOC-Gehalten und Bodenfeuchteverhältnissen unterliegen. Folglich entsteht in Permafrost beeinflussten Böden aufgrund bestimmter redoximorpher und bodenbildender Prozesse organische Substanz mit spezifischen Strukturen und Eigenschaften. Insgesamt erweisen sich Verwitterungsindices und pedogene Fe-Oxide als vielversprechende Werkzeuge um diverse Stadien des Permafrosts, des-sen räumliche Verteilung und Fragen der Oberflächenstabilität zu analysieren. Die hohe kleinräumige, geochemische Variabilität (Manuskripte 1 - 5) kann durch den Einsatz von Verwitterungsindices und pedogenen Oxiden (Manuskript 6) je nach Maßstabsebene und zu beurteilenden Prozessen entflochten werden. Zusammen mit den dargestellten Haupteinfluss-parametern auf C- und N-Kreisläufe ist eine umfassende Beurteilung der Ökosystemfunktionen des Tibetischen Hochplateaus möglich...|$|E

A therapeutic shift from intravenous to subcutaneous immunoglobulin was performed in 87 patients (66 CIDP; 21 MMN) affected by immune-mediated peripheral neuropathies with evidence of a sustained clinical response to intravenous immunoglobulin. Patients were evaluated {{by means of the}} <b>Overall</b> Neuropathy <b>Limitation</b> Scale, Medical Research Council Scale and Life Quality Index questionnaire, both at the time of therapeutic shift and after 4 months of subcutaneous immunoglobulin treatment. A sustained clinical efficacy was observed after the switch to subcutaneous immunoglobulin: the <b>Overall</b> Neuropathy <b>Limitation</b> Scale score improved in the group of 66 CIDP patients (P = 0. 018), with only one subject reporting a worsening of 1 point, and remained stable in the group of 21 MMN patients (P = 0. 841), with one subject reporting a worsening of two points. An improvement in the patient's perception of therapeutic setting was reported in both groups. This large multi-center study confirms the short-term clinical equivalence of subcutaneous versus intravenous immunoglobulin and a possible improvement in the patient's perception of therapeutic setting with the subcutaneous administration. However, further studies are required to extend the results to a longer observational period. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

40|$|Background and {{objectives}} A recent {{model of a}} subtype of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) has proposed such experiences may result from increased arousal altering auditory threat perception. Methods This study considered this theory using undergraduate students who undertook a new experimental paradigm, the Auditory Threat Discrimination Task (ATDT). This {{examined the effects of}} arousal on auditory threat perception (Study 1), and its relation to hallucination-proneness (Study 2). Results Study 1 (n = 66) found evidence that the high, as compared to low-arousal condition, was associated with a higher level of accurate and false threat detection (as measured by both number of hits and false-alarms). Study 2 addressed some methodological limitations of Study 1 and also found that the high as compared to low-arousal condition, was associated with a higher level of threat detection. Study 2 also found that high hallucination prone participants (n = 20) reported a higher level of perceived threat (as measured by both number of hits and false-alarms), compared to low hallucination prone participants (n = 20). <b>Limitations</b> <b>Overall</b> <b>limitations</b> of the work included use of a non-clinical group. Also the increased arousal induced by the experiment was modest and may not fully represent the processes in operation in clinical participants. Conclusions These findings provide some initial evidence that auditory threat detection increases under conditions of arousal, and are consistent with the proposal that some AVHs may result from hypervigilance to auditory threat. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study has}} been conducted {{on the effects of}} cloud horizontal inhomogeneity on cloud albedo bias. A two-dimensional (2 D) version of the Spherical Harmonic Discrete Ordinate Method (SHDOM) is used to estimate the albedo bias of the plane parallel (PP-IPA) and independent pixel (IPA- 2 D) approximations {{for a wide range of}} 2 D cloud fields obtained from LANDSAT. They include single layer trade cumulus, open and closed cell broken stratocumulus, and solid stratocumulus boundary layer cloud fields over ocean. Findings are presented on a variety of averaging scales and are summarized as a function of cloud fraction, mean cloud optical depth, cloud aspect ratio, standard deviation of optical depth, and the gamma function parameter Y (a measure of the width of the optical depth distribution). Biases are found to be small for small cloud fraction or mean optical depth, where the cloud fields under study behave linearly. They are large (up to 0. 20 for PP-IPA bias, - 0. 12 for IPA- 2 D bias) for large v. On a scene average basis PP-IPA bias can reach 0. 30, while IPA- 2 D bias reaches its largest magnitude at - 0. 07. Biases due to horizontal transport (IPA- 2 D) are much smaller than PP-IPA biases but account for 20 % RMS of the bias <b>overall.</b> <b>Limitations</b> of this work include the particular cloud field set used, assumptions of conservative scattering, constant cloud droplet size, no gas absorption or surface reflectance, and restriction to 2 D radiative transport. The LANDSAT data used may also be affected by radiative smoothing...|$|R
30|$|The present review {{focused on}} the {{analgesic}} efficacy and tolerability of buprenorphine given by four different administration routes, SC, SL, IM or TD. We were unable to synthesize the estimations in the non-TD route of buprenorphine. This {{was due to the}} (1) small number of studies with small numbers of participants included; (2) different SL retention times (3) different eventual disposition of the SL tablet (swallowed or expectorated) (Robbie 1979; Reisfield and Wilson 2007); (4) different total doses of IM administrations or (5) different outcome measures. <b>Overall,</b> <b>limitations</b> in volume or surface area of SL space could cause drugs given via SL route to possibilities of ulceration, while the TD route is a non-invasive alternative to the oral route, particularly for stable pain states (Reisfield and Wilson 2007). The TD buprenorphine studies have provided some indication of pain improvement over short-term studies (≼ 15 days follow- up). Moreover, AE’s such as nausea and the requirement of prophylactic antiemetic were significantly lower in the TD buprenorphine group. Published non-Cochrane reviews have assessed TD buprenorphine in particular for non-cancer pain (Deandrea et al. 2009; Rossitto et al. 2009). In these reviews, incidences of nausea and treatment termination were significantly fewer in TD buprenorphine group than in TD fentanyl group. This is comparable to our findings, although variations in the number of studies and inclusion criteria do exist. Buprenorphine has the theoretical and potential advantage of being an opioid partial agonist with low abuse potential (Robbie 1979; Bohme and Likar 2003) and approximate equal bioavailability by the SL and TD routes (Skaer 2006).|$|R
