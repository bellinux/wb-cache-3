40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} how common anaesthetic drug shortages are, how {{they affect the}} practice of anaesthesia and patient care in Harare. Methodology: A multicentre prospective observational study of anaesthetic drug availability was carried out involving a self-administered questionnaire completed by anaesthetists working in 3 Public hospitals and 6 Private hospitals in Harare daily over the period; 1 August 2014 to 31 October 2014. A total of 422 completed questionnaires were collected out of 619 that had been distributed. In {{the last week of}} October 2014, a once <b>off</b> <b>survey</b> of the hospitalsâ€™ chief pharmacists was done using a different questionnaire. Results: The incidence of reporting at least an anaesthetic drug shortage by anaesthetists was 79. 86...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the circumstances}} that led to people being disconnected from utilities, the impacts of disconnection, and how people manage to finance reconnection. It is based on 171 surveys and four interviews with consumers disconnected {{in the second half}} of 2012.  Findings are compared with Cut <b>Off</b> <b>survey</b> results from 2004 and 2008, noting a number of significant changes over the past eight years. The research reveals that paid workers are just as likely as pensioners and the unemployed to be disconnected from electricity, gas or water. Disconnection is most often the result of long-term financial stress rather than a one-off event. Furthermore, a significant number of respondents reported an unusually high utility bill and debt prior to disconnection. There was also a high proportion of people who felt that retailer payment plans were unaffordable, and a large number of people did not know that vouchers or payment assistance existed to pay utility bills in emergency situations. This suggests a strong need to improve and promote existing support services and for utility retailers to engage with consumers in ways that are tailored to their needs to avoid disconnection, especially for paid workers who may not be eligible for government assistance...|$|E
40|$|As an {{assignment}} from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, the Swedish Research Institute (IVL) has performed measurements of 2, 4, 6 -tri-tert butylphenol and Short Chain Chlorinated Paraffins (SCCPs) in sediments. The {{study has been}} carried out based on Annex 2 : Strategy for a base line one <b>off</b> <b>survey</b> for SCCPs (Agenda Item 7, ASMO 06 / 7 / 2 -E-(L)) and from the OSPAR meeting, Meeting of the environmental assessment and monitoring committee (ASMO, Hamburg: 24 - 28 April 2006). These measurements is a Swedish contribution to an “OSPAR base line one off survey” with sampling and analysis of SCCPs and 2, 4, 6 -tri-tert-butylphenol in sediments collected in Göta Älv estuary on the Swedish west coast. This sampling was planned according to the advice to the design of the one-off surveys of chemicals identified for priority actions by ICES 2005 according to points 1 - 3 : 1. The purpose of the one-off surveys is to gain a rapid overview of the occurrence of certain priority chemicals in the marine environment. This could be achieved already by small scale surveys through a limited number of samples, using one sampling type only (for example sediments) and concentrating sampling in estuaries; 2. A minimum of five samples per Contracting Party was required for a focused survey comprising one sample for reference, two samples from polluted areas and two samples from less polluted areas; 3. Sampling could be carried out for the purpose of several one-off surveys for different substances if provided in quantities of 50 - 500 g of the top centimetres of the sediments. If frozen and kept in a sample bank, the samples could be used at any time when the budget became available for their analysis and for the completion of the survey; This project was carried out in cooperation between IVL and the consultant Marine Monitoring Ltd. Apart from the 2, 4, 6 -tri-tert butylphenol, analysis of 2, 4 -di-tert-butylphenol and 2, 6 -di-tert-butylphenol were also included in this study...|$|E
