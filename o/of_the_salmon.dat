5|$|East of Texas, NY3 meets NY104B {{near the}} Lake Ontario shoreline. Past NY104B, NY3 {{parallels}} both Interstate81 (I-81) and US11 as it heads {{along the shore}} of Lake Ontario. Near the Selkirk Shores State Park west of Pulaski, NY3 intersects NY13 adjacent to the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salmon</b> River. After crossing the Salmon River, NY3 passes the Sandy Island Beach State Park before entering Jefferson County. At the county line, NY3 becomes signed as an east–west highway once again. The route continues northward toward Ellisburg where it meets NY193 {{at the entrance to}} Southwick Beach State Park northwest of the community. Past NY193, NY3 passes the lakeside at Westcott Beach State Park prior to entering the vicinity of Sackets Harbor. The route bypasses both Sackets Harbor and the Sackets Harbor Battlefield State Historic Site to the east before separating from Lake Ontario and proceeding eastward toward Watertown.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the return}} flows do not issue {{directly}} back into the Snake River, but rather feed the Snake River Aquifer underneath the Snake River Plain. Water diverted from the river for irrigation, after absorbing any surface pollutants, re-enters the ground and feeds the aquifer. Although the aquifer has maintained its level, {{it has become increasingly}} laced with contaminants. Water in the aquifer eventually travels to {{the west side of the}} Snake River Plain and re-enters the river as springs. Throughout much of the Snake River Plain and Hells Canyon, excessive sediment is also a recurring problem. In December 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a permit requiring owners of fish farms along the Snake River to reduce their phosphorus discharge by 40%. Pollutant levels in Hells Canyon upstream <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salmon</b> River confluence, including that of water temperature, dissolved nutrients, and sediment, are required to meet certain levels.|$|E

5|$|Thompson and Russell {{found another}} {{evolutionary}} lineage that originates in a glacially restricted area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salmon</b> River Mountains, Idaho. With {{the arrival of}} the Holocene interglacial, approximately 10,000 years ago, the Pleistocene glaciers receded and opened a migratory path linking these southern populations to northern areas where they currently overlap with A. m. krausei and co-migrated north into the Peace River (Canada) Valley. Ferguson also noted an intergradation in the same geographic area, but between the morphological subspecies A. m. columbianum and A. m. kraisei that run parallel to the Bitterroot and Selkirk ranges. Thompson and Russell suggest that this contact zone is between two different subspecies lineages because the A. m. columbianum lineage is geographically isolated and restricted to the central Oregon Mountains.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 17th century {{large numbers}} of Huguenot weavers arrived in the East End, {{settling}} to service an industry that grew up around the new estate at Spitalfields, where master weavers were based. They brought with them a tradition of 'reading clubs', where books were read, often in public houses. The authorities were suspicious of immigrants meeting and in some ways they were right to be as these grew into workers' associations and political organisations. Towards the middle of the 18th century the silk industry fell into a decline – partly due to the introduction of printed calico cloth – and riots ensued. These 'Spitalfield Riots' of 1769 were actually centred to the east and were put down with considerable force, culminating in two men being hanged in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salmon</b> and Ball public house at Bethnal Green. One was John Doyle (an Irish weaver), the other John Valline (of Huguenot descent).|$|E
5|$|The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), {{was created}} in 1965 {{as a way for}} the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the U.S. Weather Bureau to work together, reduce the {{duplication}} of services, and coordinate national fire planning and operations. The U.S. Weather Bureau office was moved to {{the second floor of the}} old administration building on June 5, 1969. The U.S. Weather Bureau made the Boise office its “hub of fire weather activities” in the west where fire weather specialists are able to make face to face contact with the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management fire dispatchers. U.S. Congress approved the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) requested for $316,000 in additional funds in the fiscal year 1970 budget in July 1969 for the Boise, Idaho, Indianapolis, Indiana, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and for bringing Oklahoma City, Oklahoma up to full Weather Service Forecast Office (WSFO) status. On June 22, 1970, the Boise Forecast Office began issuing official weather forecasts for Idaho south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salmon</b> River. The U.S. Weather Bureau changed their name to the National Weather Service on October 1, 1970.|$|E
