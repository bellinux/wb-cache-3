5|$|Compared {{with other}} BBC series {{broadcast}} in the 1960s, Doctor Who is well-represented in surviving episodes. Of the 253 episodes broadcast during the 1960s, 156 still exist – mainly due to copies produced for <b>overseas</b> <b>sales.</b> For example, Seasons 1 and 2, {{the most widely}} sold abroad of the 1960s era, are missing only 9 and 2 episodes, respectively. By contrast, the less well-sold Seasons 4 and 5 respectively have none and two complete serials between them, The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Enemy of the World from season five. Doctor Whos popularity and high-profile have also helped to ensure the return of episodes which, for other less well-remembered programmes, might never have occurred.|$|E
5|$|Most Doctor Who episodes {{were made}} on two-inch {{videotape}} for initial broadcast and then telerecorded onto 16 mm film by BBC Enterprises for further commercial exploitation. Enterprises used 16mm for <b>overseas</b> <b>sales</b> as it was considerably cheaper to buy and easier to transport than videotape. It also circumvented the problem of different countries' incompatible video standards, as film was a universal medium whereas videotape was not. The BBC had no central archive at the time; the Film Library kept programmes {{that had been made}} on film, while the Engineering Department was responsible for storing videotapes. BBC Enterprises only kept copies of programmes they deemed commercially exploitable. They had little dedicated storage space, and tended to place piles of film canisters wherever they could find space for them at their Villiers House property.|$|E
5|$|Prior to World War II Degesch derived {{most of its}} Zyklon B {{profits from}} <b>overseas</b> <b>sales,</b> {{particularly}} in the United States, where it was produced under license by Roessler & Hasslacher prior to 1931 and by American Cyanamid from 1931 to 1943. From 1929, the United States Public Health Service used Zyklon B to disinfest freight trains and clothes of Mexican immigrants entering the United States. Uses in Germany included delousing clothing (often using a portable sealed chamber invented by Degesch in the 1930s) and disinfesting ships, warehouses, and trains. By 1943, sales of Zyklon B accounted for 65 per cent of Degesch's sales revenue and 70 per cent of its gross profits.|$|E

5|$|Dharma Productions' first release came in 1980 {{with the}} Raj Khosla-directed Dostana, {{starring}} Amitabh Bachchan, Shatrughan Sinha and Zeenat Aman, {{which was a}} commercial success. However, their subsequent releases, Duniya (1984) and Muqaddar Ka Faisla (1987) performed poorly at the box office. Their first release of the 1990s, the Bachchan-starring thriller Agneepath (1990) garnered critical acclaim but was a commercial failure. The company's next releases were the thriller Gumrah (1993) and the comedy Duplicate (1998), both directed by Mahesh Bhatt. In 1998, Yash Johar's son, Karan Johar made his directorial debut with the coming-of-age romantic drama Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, starring Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Rani Mukerji and Salman Khan. The film was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of 1998, and established Dharma Productions as a leading production company in India. Their subsequent releases, the ensemble family melodrama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), the tear-jerking romantic drama Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003) and the musical romantic drama Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), all starring Khan, were popular among the Indian diaspora worldwide and emerged as top-grossing Hindi films in <b>overseas</b> <b>sales.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Tribe of Gum: An early working title {{which was}} used up until the {{beginning}} of recording. It survived in a few documents derived from earlier paperwork, such as the payments for <b>overseas</b> <b>sales,</b> and started appearing again in reference works in the late 1970s and 1980s, including being used when the transcript of the serial was published by Titan Books.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, it was {{reported}} {{for the first time}} in 16 years that California wine sales were down. This was not due to a decrease in drinking wine as much as it was a decrease in customers' willingness to spend top dollar on wine. Jon Fredrikson, President of Gomberg, Fredrikson & Associates said that sales of $3 to $6 a bottle wine and $9 to $12 wine had seen growth, but the sales of wine over $20 had stagnated. In addition, most of this loss in market was occurring in <b>overseas</b> <b>sales,</b> as opposed to U.S. sales.|$|E

25|$|Probably their largest {{impact was}} in export markets. Before 1950, exports {{accounted}} for only 10 percent of production output, but a decade later, exports were now at 50% of output. Beers in the Netherlands became a very important partner. Beers became official importers for Scania-Vabis in the Netherlands, and established a dealer network, along with training programmes for both mechanics and drivers. Beers also offered free twice-yearly overhauls of their customers vehicles, and offered a mobile service throughout the Netherlands with their custom-equipped service trucks. Due to Beers concerted efforts, Scania-Vabis market share in the country remained at a consistent 20% throughout this period. Scania-Vabis were to adopt the business model of Beers in their own <b>overseas</b> <b>sales</b> operations.|$|E
25|$|Veteran actor-producer John McCallum and filmmaker Lee Robinson {{created the}} children's {{adventure}} series Skippy the Bush Kangaroo which premiered in 1968 on the Nine Network. At a reported cost of A$6000 per episode {{it was said}} to have been the most expensive Australian TV series yet produced up to that time (by comparison, the first series of Star Trek reportedly cost around US$200,000 per episode). Although Australian TV was still in black-and-white at the time, Skippy was filmed in colour with a view to <b>overseas</b> <b>sales</b> {{and it was the first}} Australian-made series to achieve significant international success, with sales to more than 80 countries worldwide, and it became the first Australian TV show to be widely screened in the USA.|$|E
25|$|The {{new show}} indeed {{performed}} well; the pilot's ratings {{were higher than}} those of many network programs, and ratings remained comparable to network shows {{by the end of the}} first season despite the handicap of each station airing the show on a different day and time, often outside prime time. By the end of the first season, Paramount reportedly received $1 million for advertising per episode, more than the roughly $800,000 fee that networks typically paid for a one-hour show; by 1992, when the budget for each episode had risen to almost $2 million, the studio earned $90 million from advertising annually from first-run episodes, with each 30-second commercial selling for $115,000 to $150,000. The show had a 40% return on investment for Paramount, with $30 to $60 million in annual upfront net profit for first-run episodes and another $70 million for stripping rights for each of the about 100 episodes then available, so did not need <b>overseas</b> <b>sales</b> to be successful.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} aiming at observing the {{privatization}} {{trend of the}} state-owned enterprises after the declaration of the privatization of {{a great number of}} the state-owned enterprises in 1998. This thesis analyzed and made comments on this issue, and got an enlightenment on the <b>overseas</b> <b>sale</b> of the state-owned enterprises, according to a deep analysis of POSCO’s and KEPCO’s achievement on privatization by issuing Depositary Receipts. To issue DR (deposit receipt of stock) in overseas did not restrict the holding limitation of foreigners; it also has the advantage of getting the domestic premium in Korea. So it is considered to be the principal method of the <b>overseas</b> <b>sale</b> of the state-owned enterprises. The result of this thesis shows that, generally speaking, the recent issue of the DR of state-owned enterprises is successful as a blueprint of privatization. But in order to maximize the scale of sales financing, it is necessary to implement sale strategies by way of taking the pre-market stabilization, using financial experts, accepting various skills of selling...|$|R

25|$|ASCII {{was founded}} in 1977 by Kazuhiko Nishi and Keiichiro Tsukamoto. Originally a {{publisher}} of a magazine with the same name ASCII, talks between Bill Gates and Nishi led to a creation of Microsoft's first <b>overseas</b> <b>sales</b> office, ASCII Microsoft, in 1979. Nishi was also known {{for his role in}} marketing the MSX in 1983, an 8-bit standard computer well known in the former USSR and Japan. In 1984, ASCII engaged itself in semiconductor business, followed by a further expansion into commercial online service in 1985 under the brand of ASCII-NET. As the popularity of home video game systems soared in the 1980s, ASCII became active in the development and publishing of software and peripherals for popular consoles such as the Family Computer and Mega Drive. After Microsoft's public stock offering in 1986, ASCII Microsoft was dissolved. At around the same time, the company was also obliged to reform itself {{as a result of its}} aggressive diversification in the first half of the 1980s. The company went public in 1989.|$|E
25|$|The {{total market}} {{worldwide}} for high-tech toilets was about US$800 million in 1997. The largest producer is Toto, with 65% {{of the market}} share, while the second largest is Inax at 25%. The main market for washlets is still in Japan, and TOTO reports that <b>overseas</b> <b>sales</b> account for just 5% of its revenue. The primary foreign market is China, where Toto sells over one million washlets each year. In the US for example, sales are well below Japanese levels, even though sales improved from 600 units per month in 2001 to 1,000 units per month in 2003. In Europe, Toto sells only 5,000 washlets annually. While most Europeans would probably regard Japanese washlets as quite a curiosity, {{the number of such}} toilets being installed in Europe is on the rise. This is mainly for the special purpose of toilets for the handicapped. Depending on the type of disability, handicapped persons may have difficulties reaching the anus region in order to clean themselves after toilet use. Hence, the introduction of toilets with a water jet cleaner and blow dryer allows such persons to clean themselves without assistance.|$|E
