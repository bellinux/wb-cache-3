30|$|Benasser [2] {{proposed}} an algorithm {{to solve the}} reachability problem using the logical abstraction and constraint programming techniques.

25|$|A* is an {{informed}} search algorithm, or a best-first search, {{meaning that it}} solves problems by searching among all possible paths to the solution (goal) for the one that incurs the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.), and among these paths it first considers the ones that appear to lead most quickly to the solution. It is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific node of a graph, it constructs a tree of paths starting from that node, expanding paths <b>one</b> <b>step</b> <b>at</b> a time, until one of its paths ends at the predetermined goal node.|$|E
25|$|An unmoved pawn {{can move}} one step, {{up to the}} middle of the board (in the case of the 16×16 board, the eighth rank), or {{anything}} in between. Thus, 1.i8 is a legal opening move, and so are 1.i3, 1.i4, 1.i5, 1.i6, and 1.i7. Once it has moved for the first time, it can only make <b>one</b> <b>step</b> <b>at</b> a time. (In the case of an 8×8 board, this is exactly the same as in standard chess). Such a long initial pawn move allows the moving pawn to be captured en passant by an enemy pawn as if it had stopped on any one of the squares it had passed through.|$|E
500|$|Some evangelicals criticized Zacharias' {{decision}} not to use this opportunity to directly address the [...] "deep and foundational" [...] differences between the historic Christian faith {{and that of the}} LDS church. He responded by asserting that Christians should not immediately condemn Mormonism's theological differences but [...] "graciously build <b>one</b> <b>step</b> <b>at</b> a time in communicating our faith with clarity and conviction". He said this is just as effective as showing someone the faults of their faith. The speaking engagement was nearly sabotaged by a claim by event organizer Greg Johnson, president of Standing Together, that Zacharias {{had nothing to do with}} editing the book The Kingdom of the Cults and had only loaned his name to the latest edition. Johnson later apologized for his comment.|$|E

5000|$|Nearly all {{electronic}} {{computers in}} use today are based on theoretical von Neumann computers or Turing machines, i.e.: they are devices that perform <b>one</b> small, deterministic <b>step</b> <b>at</b> a time. If all inputs are specified, the computer will always produce a particular output which is calculated deterministically. Computer scientists also study other models of computation including parallel computers (more than <b>one</b> deterministic <b>step</b> <b>at</b> a time), and quantum computers (which are based on non-deterministic quantum mechanical models). Computer systems or programs are often described as non-deterministic if their behavior depends on factors that cannot be predicted or reliably reproduced, such {{as the time of}} day or the speed at which the user enters data at the keyboard. This, however, is a somewhat different usage of the term.|$|R
500|$|Mendes had Spacey and Bening in {{mind for}} the leads from the beginning, but DreamWorks {{executives}} were unenthusiastic. The studio suggested several alternatives, including Bruce Willis, Kevin Costner, or John Travolta to play Lester, and Helen Hunt or Holly Hunter to play Carolyn. Mendes did not want a big star [...] "weighing the film down"; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the 1995 films The Usual Suspects and Seven, and 1992's Glengarry Glen Ross. Spacey was surprised; he said, [...] "I usually play characters who are very quick, very manipulative and smart. [...] I usually wade in dark, sort of treacherous waters. This is a man living <b>one</b> <b>step</b> <b>at</b> a time, playing by his instincts. This is actually much closer to me, to what I am, than those other parts." [...] Mendes offered Bening the role of Carolyn without the studio's consent; although executives were upset at Mendes, by September 1998, DreamWorks had entered negotiations with Spacey and Bening.|$|E

2500|$|Monads allow a {{programming}} style where {{programs are}} written by putting together highly composable parts, combining in flexible ways the possible actions {{that can work}} on {{a particular type of}} data. As such, monads have been described as [...] "programmable semicolons"; a semicolon is the operator used to chain together individual statements in many imperative programming languages, thus the expression implies that extra code will be executed between the actions in the pipeline. Monads have also been explained with a physical metaphor as assembly lines, where a conveyor belt transports data between functional units that transform it <b>one</b> <b>step</b> <b>at</b> a time.|$|E

Trudeau granted an interview to Rolling Stone in 2004 in which he discussed his time at Yale University, which he attended two years behind George W. Bush. He granted another Rolling Stone interview in 2010. In 2006, The Washington Post printed an extensive profile of Trudeau by writer Gene Weingarten.

It was his most successful studio album, producing such hits as [...] "Heartland", [...] "I Cross My Heart", and [...] "When Did You Stop Loving Me", and peaked at No.1 and No.6 respectively on the Country and Billboard 200 album charts. The success continued with his next album, Easy Come, Easy Go in 1993, which reached the top five on the Billboard 200 and featured the hits [...] "I'd Like to Have That One Back", [...] "The Man in Love with You", and the No.1 title track. His next four albums, including Lead On in 1994, Blue Clear Sky in 1996, Carrying Your Love with Me in 1997, and 1998's <b>One</b> <b>Step</b> <b>at</b> a Time, all charted at No.1, with Blue Clear Sky claiming the spot on its debut week, and Carrying Your Love with Me peaking at No.1 on the Billboard 200 {{for the first time}} in Strait's career.

40|$|Abstract – New {{treatment}} {{technologies are}} currently being investigated {{for the treatment of}} contaminated drilling waste mud with oil. Supercritical fluid extraction is a promising technology that could be effectively used to extract this contaminated drilling waste mud.

5|$|Researchers have {{synthesized}} many three-dimensional DNA complexes {{that each}} have the connectivity of a polyhedron, {{such as a}} cube or octahedron, meaning that the DNA duplexes trace the edges of a polyhedron with a DNA junction at each vertex. The earliest demonstrations of DNA polyhedra were very work-intensive, requiring multiple ligations and solid-phase synthesis steps to create catenated polyhedra. Subsequent work yielded polyhedra whose synthesis was much easier.
