5|$|Having bonded with Percy and valuing their relationship, Carl accepts Percy's {{enthusiastic}} <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> out {{on weekends}} and holidays when the two are back in Los Angeles. Ramsey visits the truck to explain that he wrote the bad review as he felt Carl's skills did not suit a restaurant which had been serving the same menu for years. He leaves with an offer to bankroll a new restaurant. In a flash-forward set six months later, the new restaurant is successful and closed for a private event: Carl and Inez's remarriage ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of Alexandria put more trust in Rick's group {{to protect the}} town better. A group known as the Wolves use a zombie horde to attack Alexandria, and many lives are lost before the living regain control. While recovering, they learn of a community called the Hilltop, who <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> trade supplies if they can end {{the threat of the}} extortionist Saviors led by a man named Negan. Although Rick's group decimate one Savior outpost, they are later caught by Negan, and forced to swear loyalty to him.|$|E

The reported offer consisted of help in stabilizing Iraq, cutting ties with Hezbollah and greater transparency in its nuclear program in return for lifting sanctions and dismantling the Mujahedeen-e Khalq, an organisation working to overthrow the Iranian government.|$|E
25|$|Halloweird (Mike Ford) (October 1998) : Mitchell's dad is {{planning}} a special Halloween show on radio station WERD, a spooky story about invaders from Mars. Then Mitchell and Stanley find some terrific costumes at a local shop, and <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the proprietor organize a Halloween parade in return for letting them use the costumes for Halloween, unaware that {{they are about to}} get caught up in the weirdest adventure of all.

25|$|If {{the player}} chose the Path of Flesh {{early in the}} game, Michael will get into the {{elevator}} and a tape will play, claiming that he and Jigsaw are similar and would both like to give justice to a world of criminals. Michael then faces two doors; one leads Michael to freedom {{and the chance to}} use the evidence found by his father to print the story of Jigsaw and the drug cartel. The other door reveals a Pighead costume and an <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> people see the truth inside themselves, implying Michael can become another Jigsaw apprentice.

25|$|The lizards' {{communication}} is somewhat {{similar to their}} human counterparts. Like Nancy, Sarah is more open to the humans and more interested in their world. She is also emotional, and when Charlie asks her a question that is {{hard for her to}} understand (what she would do if Leslie disappeared), she becomes distraught, leading to a confrontation. Leslie shares Charlie's attitude; he does not trust the humans and regards most everything they say with skepticism. Despite these problems, {{at the end of the}} play, some measure of trust is reached between all of them. Leslie decides that he and Sarah will stay on land when Nancy and Charlie, albeit reluctantly, <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> them.|$|E
500|$|Pound was {{transferred}} to U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps headquarters in Genoa, where he was interrogated by Frank L. Amprin, an FBI agent assigned by J. Edgar Hoover. Pound asked to send a cable to President Truman to <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> negotiate peace with Japan. He also asked to be allowed a final broadcast, a script called [...] "Ashes of Europe Calling", in which he recommended peace with Japan, American management of Italy, {{the establishment of a}} Jewish state in Palestine, and leniency toward Germany. His requests were denied and the script was forwarded to Hoover.|$|E
500|$|Scully's co-option of Mulders' usual role also {{demonstrates}} {{the complexity of}} her character. Although she is strongly influenced by her scientific background, she has religious faith too. Paul C. Peterson notes that although this episode is not directly about religion, it shows {{the first of several}} visions Scully experiences throughout the series; later visions appear in episodes more directly related to religion and Scully's faith, such as [...] "One Breath", [...] "Elegy" [...] and [...] "All Souls". In this episode, her faith in her father ultimately proves stronger than her belief in the paranormal as she refuses to be tempted by Boggs. Rather than take him up on his <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> her contact her father, Scully visits her partner in the hospital.|$|E

500|$|Saving for {{a bicycle}} {{and not wanting}} to spend money on entertainment, Stan takes a free [...] "personality test" [...] being offered by Scientologists on the street. After {{answering}} a long questionnaire, Stan is informed that he is extremely depressed and therefore a perfect candidate for Scientology. They <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him out for $240. Back home, Stan asks his parents for the money. His father suggests that he use the money he had been saving. Stan pays and is taken into an auditing room where an attendant reads his [...] "thetan levels" [...] using an [...] "E-meter". Stan has such a high reading that the Scientology headquarters in Los Angeles is notified. There, the president of Scientology determines that, because his reading is so high, Stan must be a reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, Scientology's founder and prophet.|$|E
500|$|In 1965 Thorpe {{asked his}} {{parliamentary}} colleague Peter Bessell {{to help him}} resolve the problem. Bessell met Scott and warned him that his threats against Thorpe might be considered as blackmail; he did, however, <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Scott obtain a new National Insurance card, the lack {{of which had been}} a long-running source of aggravation. This quietened matters for a while, but within a year Scott was causing trouble again. With Thorpe's agreement, Bessell began paying Scott a [...] "retainer" [...] of £5 a week, supposedly as compensation for the welfare benefits that Scott had been unable to obtain because of his missing card. Bessell later stated that by 1968 Thorpe was considering ways in which Scott might be permanently silenced; he thought his old Oxford friend David Holmes might organise this. [...] Holmes had been best man at Thorpe's wedding, and was completely loyal to him.|$|E
500|$|Apollo {{returns to}} the forest and finds {{the home of the}} myrmekes, rescuing Meg. They {{discover}} the entrance of the grove, along with the missing demigods. Nero appears and identifies himself as [...] "the Beast" [...] and Meg's stepfather, forcing Apollo to open the grove's gates. Nero tries to burn the grove down, but Peaches, Meg's karpoi friend, attacks him before he can. Nero and Apollo briefly fight each other, and Nero uses Greek fire in a last attempt to destroy the grove. The dryads come to help, consuming the fire to save the grove. Apollo helps Meg put the wind chimes on the largest tree, which gives a prophecy to Apollo. Meg then releases him from his service and runs away. Later, Nero sends the Colossus Neronis to destroy the camp, but with the help of Percy and the other campers, Apollo defeats the statue by hitting it with a plague-enchanted arrow. The next morning, Leo Valdez and Calypso return to Camp Half-Blood, and the two <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Apollo in his quest to rescue the Oracle of Trophonius from Triumvirate Holdings.|$|E

500|$|In mid-1980, {{after the}} May eruption, USGS Survey {{scientists}} decided {{to establish the}} David A. Johnston Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO) in Vancouver, intending to closely monitor volcanoes in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Glicken returned to St. Helens to analyze {{the remains of the}} volcano's lateral blast. However, as other CVO employees had already commenced their research at the mountain, Glicken's <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> USGS on his own was declined by senior scientists. Instead, he found work with newly appointed Survey employee Barry Voight, a specialist in landslides. Under Voight's guidance, Glicken absorbed himself in his work, motivated to earn a job at the Survey, and to relieve some of his anguish over Johnston's death. Glicken and a team of geologists mapped the debris field left over from St. Helens's structural collapse, which consisted of roughly a quarter of the mass of the volcano. Through extensive, meticulous analysis, the team traced the origins and the means of movement of each piece of debris, ranging from blocks [...] in width to mere fragments.|$|E
500|$|Some {{time has}} passed (at least two generations). In a remote wooded valley where the Rhine flows, the ageless Rhinemaidens {{continue}} to mourn for the gold, pleading with the [...] "Sun-woman" [...] to send them a champion who will return the gold to them. Siegfried's horn is heard, and he soon appears, having lost his way while hunting. The maidens greet him with their old playfulness and <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him, {{for the price of}} the ring on his finger. After a flirtatious exchange, Siegfried offers, apparently sincerely, to give them the ring. But instead of wisely simply accepting his offer, the mood of the naive, formerly flirtatious [...] Rhinemaidens suddenly becomes solemn: they warn Siegfried he will be killed that very day unless he delivers the ring to them. But brave Siegfried will never submit to any such implied threat and declares: [...] "By threatening my life and limb, even if it weren't worth as much as a finger, you won't get the ring from me!" [...] The maidens are scornful of his folly: [...] "Farewell, Siegfried. A proud woman will today become your heir, scoundrel! She'll give us a better hearing". Siegfried is not aware that it is to Brünnhilde that they refer. They swim off, leaving a puzzled Siegfried to ponder their words and to admit to himself that he could happily have seduced any one of them.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from January 7, 1911. It states, [...] "Miss Street's Seminary for Girls has a very ambitious class of pupils. The young athletes, not content with basketball and tennis, aspire to shine in the great American game, and organize a baseball club. They are so satisfied with themselves that they finally send a challenge to Adair College, which has a crowd of husky young athletes in a club that thinks it amounts to something. When the challenge is received, the boys are first angry, then amused. They decide to accept it, {{to have fun with}} the girls. The young women, after some practice, realize that their team, while it may be pretty to look at, is of little real use on the diamond. And the prospect makes them weep. Fortunately for the girls, Jack, the brother of the president, arrives from Harvard. His chum, Jim, is with him. These two young men are baseball stars themselves, and when they are told of the predicament of the girls, they goodnaturedly <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> them out. The university men disguise themselves as girls, act as battery for the young women, and the college boys, who had looked for a laughable victory, are mowed down, inning after inning, because of the work of pitcher Jack and catcher Jim. The other members of the 'girl' team have nothing to do except look pretty. When the boy athletes have retired from the field vanquished, the girls reward their battery with one kiss - only one - from each of the other seven players." ...|$|E
