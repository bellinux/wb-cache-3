40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the participation reasons and the benefits of volunteering in sport federations in Turkey. The data is collected through the semi-structured interviews with the volunteers that have a task in the various managerial levels of the sport federations. The semi-structured forms are developed afterdocument analyses and consisted of 8 questions. Snowball sampling method is used to designate the working group and overall 22 interviews are done. Three researchers made content analyses separately on the interviews. The categories are determined after the analyses and the findings are presented descriptively. According to the findings,the reasons of participation to volunteering are 1 - to develop carrier, 2 - love of sport, 3 - the need to be helpful, 4 - the will to fill the leisure time and 5 - to fulfill the <b>social</b> responsibility. The <b>benefits</b> of the volunteers are examined inthree dimensions. First, the individual benefits are consisted with the categories as, happiness and inner peace,experience and information, self-expression and creativity and helping <b>others.</b> <b>Social</b> <b>benefits</b> are assigned as making a circle of friends, social prestige, and social interactions. The organizational benefits are defined as the communication between the organizations, the contribution to the organization and the contribution to the system of sport. Consequently, the findings supported the Serious Leisure Theory and indicated that there are favorable relations between the participation reasons and the benefits of volunteering in sport federation...|$|R

50|$|The Liberals can be {{credited}} with few further accomplishments of major proportions. The system of debt peonage that {{lingered in the}} sierra came under government regulations, albeit weak ones, and imprisonment for debts was finally outlawed in 1918. These and <b>other</b> limited <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> gained by the Native Ecuadorians and the mixedblood montuvio (coastal mestizo) working class were overshadowed by the ruinous economic decline world wide and the severe repression of the nascent labor movement {{at the hands of}} the Liberals during the early 1920s. Furthermore, Liberal rule did little to foster the development of stable democracy. On the contrary, the first half of the period saw even more illegal seizures of power and military-led governments than in previous decades.|$|R
40|$|In Auton v. British Columbia, our courts faced {{a perfect}} storm created by colliding social, political, and legal forces. The {{end result of}} the {{litigation}} in Canada was a case described by the Supreme Court as “the first case of this type to reach this court. ” {{in the view of}} the Supreme Court, the unanimous findings in the lower court had been built upon an incorrect premise that the provincial medicare scheme conferred a statutory right to public funding for all medically necessary services. The Court concluded that outside these core medical services, the statute had granted administrative discretion as to whether to extend public funding for treatments, such as intensive behavioural the rapy or other professional disciplines, such as behavioural the rapy. The Court went on to consider whether the petitioners were wrongly excluded from funding under the statute as properly construed. The perfect storm underlying Auton raises the more general question of the intersection of equality rights and the development and administration of social programs. In this paper, Geoffrey Cowper addresses some of the criticisms made of the result and reasoning in Auton. He the n addresses briefly the results and reasoning in <b>other</b> <b>social</b> <b>benefit</b> cases. That analysis suggests that the Court does not have a fixed approach to equality claims which arise in the context of <b>social</b> <b>benefit</b> programs. Rather, as in Auton, the Court appears consistently to prefer a more narrowly legal means of resolving the disputes rather than employing general questions of social policy and considering how equality analysis may facilitate or interfere with identified social objectives. To the extent that the decided cases indicate a trend, the Court appears to have little hesitation when it is convinced that the use of the distinction in its context is arbitrary and unfair...|$|R
50|$|Broadcast and {{television}} license fees were abolished, while {{a wide range}} of new benefits were introduced, such as a handicapped child’s allowance, a special orphan’s pension, and the Supporting Mothers Benefit. Rates of sickness and unemployment benefits were increased to bring them in line with <b>other</b> <b>social</b> security <b>benefits,</b> while funding was provided for child care, women’s refuges, and community health programs. The means test for pensioners over the age of seventy-five was abolished in 1973, and in 1975 the means test was abolished for all pensioners over the age of seventy. As a result of the welfare measures undertaken by the Whitlam Government, social expenditures as a percentage of GDP rose from 12.5% to 17.6% during its time in office.|$|R

30|$|As {{with labor}} laws, {{the key for}} <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> is to balance {{the amount of the}} benefit aimed at support of low-income {{households}} with the disincentives it might create to participate in the labor force and seek economic opportunities in leading regions. It is also important to ensure that the eligibility criteria for <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> and services do not bind people to their current place of residence, and the benefits are easily portable across the country. In <b>other</b> words, existing <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> and services should be spatially blind in their design and universal in their coverage – i.e. made available to every eligible person or household regardless of its location (World Bank [2009 a]). In Ukraine, there is also room to reconsider the design of some not well targeted social assistance programs to improve the equity of the social welfare system and save costs that can be channeled into other important programs or areas (World Bank [2010]).|$|R

5000|$|Singapore is {{an example}} of a country with a {{sterilization}} incentive program. In the 1980s, Singapore offered US$5000 to women who elected to be sterilized. Interestingly, the conditions associated with receiving this grant were fairly obvious in their aim at targeting low income and less educated parents. It specified that both parents should be below a specified educational level and that their combined income should not exceed $750 per month. [...] This program, among other birth control incentives and education programs, greatly reduced Singapore’s birth rate, female mortality rate, and infant mortality rate, while increasing family income, female participation in the labor force, and rise in educational attainment among <b>other</b> <b>social</b> <b>benefits.</b> These are the intended results of most incentivizing programs, although questions of their ethicality remain.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} a location selection analysis for choosing a suitable borough {{in the region}} of Greater London to construct a large casino. Currently 17 of the 26 large casinos in London are located in the borough of Westminster which is known to generate the highest revenue in tourist spending. However, in 2007 the Casino Advisory Panel (CAP) recommended the borough of Newham as the most suitable area for a new casino instead of Westminster. By taking two viewpoints into consideration (one focussed on profitability and the <b>other</b> on <b>social</b> <b>benefits),</b> we evaluate the alternatives using the weighted sum, the TOPSIS and the PROMETHEE methods. The results are compared to the proposals submitted to the CAP for validation. We find that the PROMETHEE and the Weighted Sum Method are more suitable than TOPSIS for solving this problem. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
