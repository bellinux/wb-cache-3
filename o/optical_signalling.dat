He placed a bet with his friend, the horse racing gambler Lord Marsh, that he could transmit knowledge of the outcome of the race in just one hour. Using a network of signalling sections erected on high ground, the signal would be observed from one station to the next by means of a telescope. The signal itself consisted of a large pointer that could be placed into eight possible positions in 45 degree increments. A series of two such signals gave a total 64 code elements and a third signal took it up to 512. He only returned to his idea in 1795, after hearing of Chappe's system.|$|E

5000|$|In {{nearly all}} cases the perigone {{consists}} of two alternating trimerous whorls of tepals, being , without differentiation between calyx and corolla. In [...] (pollinated by animals) taxa, both whorls are corolline (petal-like). Anthesis (the period of flower opening) is usually [...] (short lived). Some of the more persistent perigones demonstrate thermonastic opening and closing (responsive to changes in temperature). About two thirds of monocots are zoophilous, predominantly by insects. These plants need to advertise to pollinators and do so by way of phaneranthous (showy) flowers. Such <b>optical</b> <b>signalling</b> is usually {{a function of the}} tepal whorls but may also be provided by semaphylls (other structures such as filaments, staminodes or stylodia which have become modified to attract pollinators). However, some monocot plants may have aphananthous (inconspicuous) flowers and still be pollinated by animals. In these the plants rely either on chemical attraction or other structures such as coloured bracts fulfill the role of optical attraction. In some phaneranthous plants such structures may reinforce floral structures. The production of fragrances for olfactory signalling are common in monocots. The perigone also functions as a landing platform for pollinating insects.|$|E

Fluorosis, toxicity due {{to high levels of}} fluoride in drinking water, is a serious human health concern {{in many parts of the}} world Synthetic chemists seek to mimic nature’s level of sophistication in designing and making chemosensors capable of determining the concentration of a target anion in any medium. Beginning with a review of anion sensor chemistry with a particular focus on developments over the past 15 years, this thesis documents research into novel molecular sensors that target the differential sensing of fluoride and chloride anions. The design of these sensors has focussed on an <b>optical</b> <b>signalling</b> event based on electronic changes on binding but in addition, by virtue of a significant change in structural conformation. Fluorescent molecules have been utilised and as such, fluorescence emission changes investigated in the presence of a variety of anions. Results and Discussion I outlines our conformational model and discusses the design, synthesis and sensory behaviour of phenyl(boronates). UV, electrochemical, fluorescence and NMR techniques are brought together to elucidate the response of this class of molecule to various anions. One example designed to fit our proposed model shows interesting and unusual fluorescence quenching response to chloride anion. In addition, the synthesis of a related carbamate species and a range of oxygen bridged boron macrocycles are reported. Results and Discussion II discloses our approaches to more synthetically demanding constructs, obeying the model but trying to overcome the challenges met previously.
