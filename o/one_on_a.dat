5|$|For {{a general}} system, states are {{typically}} not pure, but instead are represented as statistical mixtures of pure states, or mixed states, given by density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Hilbert space. Moreover, for general quantum mechanical systems, {{the effects of}} a single measurement can influence other parts of a system {{in a manner that is}} described instead by a positive operator valued measure. Thus the structure both of the states and observables in the general theory is considerably more complicated than the idealization for pure states.|$|E
5|$|French tirailleurs {{occupied}} the dominant positions, especially <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> knoll overlooking {{the square of}} the 27th. Unable to break square to drive off the French infantry {{because of the presence of}} French cavalry and artillery, the 27th had to remain in that formation and endure the fire of the tirailleurs. That fire nearly annihilated the 27th Foot, the Inniskillings, who lost two-thirds of their strength within that three or four hours.|$|E
5|$|In Bobby Petrino's {{first visit}} to Tuscaloosa as a head coach, Alabama opened conference play by {{defeating}} the Arkansas Razorbacks 35–7. After a scoreless first quarter, two big touchdown plays, a 52-yard run by Trent Richardson and a 50-yard pass from Greg McElroy to Julio Jones, had the Tide up 14–0 at the half. Arkansas responded early {{in the third quarter}} and cut the lead to 14–7 after Ryan Mallett hit Greg Childs for an 18-yard touchdown reception; the Hogs would not reach the end zone again as the Tide responded with three unanswered touchdowns. Bama scored first on an 80-yard touchdown pass from McElroy to Marquis Maze followed with two touchdowns by Mark Ingram, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 14-yard pass from McElroy and <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 2-yard run, bringing the final score to 35–7.|$|E

5|$|County {{finished}} the 2007–08 season {{fourth in the}} league, and subsequently won their play-off semi-final against Wycombe Wanderers 2–1 on aggregate. The club had previously visited Wembley four times, and Gannon had played on all four occasions. He did as a manager what he could never do as a player, and guided Stockport victory at Wembley; the 3–2 win over Rochdale earned Gannon's club promotion to League One. He refused to give a post-match interview to Sky Sports following a nine-month dispute with the company over a broken Skybox. Nevertheless, having quickly taken Stockport from the foot of League Two and into League <b>One</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> meagre budget, Gannon had established himself {{as one of the}} most highly rated young managers in the lower leagues. In the summer he sold Liam Dickinson to Derby County for £750,000 – a player signed by previous manager, Chris Turner from Woodley Sports for a nominal fee just over two years previous.|$|E
5|$|Coyote {{attacks on}} humans are {{uncommon}} and rarely cause serious injuries, {{due to the}} relatively small size of the coyote, but have been increasingly frequent, especially in California. There have been two confirmed fatal attacks: <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> three-year-old named Kelly Keen in Glendale, California and another on a nineteen-year-old named Taylor Mitchell in Nova Scotia, Canada. In the 30 {{years leading up to}} March 2006, at least 160 attacks occurred in the United States, mostly in the Los Angeles County area. Data from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wildlife Services, the California Department of Fish and Game, and other sources show that while 41 attacks occurred during the period of 1988–1997, 48 attacks were verified from 1998 through 2003. The majority of these incidents occurred in Southern California near the suburban-wildland interface.|$|E

He moved to Chesterfield of League <b>One</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> free transfer on 19 January 2007, signing a contract taking him {{to the end of}} the 2006–07 season. He made his debut in a 1–0 defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion on 20 January. During a game against Crewe Alexandra on 7 April he picked up a groin strain, which resulted in him undergoing a scan. He also suffered from a virus while at the club and was released in May 2007, after making 10 appearances as Chesterfield were relegated to League Two.|$|E

5|$|Lax matriculated in the Michaelmas term of 1781 {{and became}} a private tutor to John Pond, later Astronomer Royal. Lax was elected a scholar (i.e. <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> scholarship) of Trinity in 1784; John Cranke and Henry Therond were his tutors, a role which would have seen them not only {{teaching}} Lax, but also acting {{in the role of}} in loco parentis. Lax was conferred a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in 1785 and graduated as the Senior Wrangler and was awarded the first Smith's Prize of his year. Until 1790, all examinations at Trinity were written in Latin.|$|E
5|$|The 1894-S Barber dime {{is one of}} {{the great}} numismatic rarities, with a {{published}} mintage of 24 proof pieces. Various stories attend the question of how so few came to be coined. According to Nancy Oliver and Richard Kelly in their 2011 article for The Numismatist, the San Francisco Mint in June 1894 needed to coin $2.40 in silver left over from the melting of worn-out coins, just enough to coin 24 dimes. More ten-cent pieces were expected to be struck there later in the year, but this did not occur. Breen, on the other hand, related that San Francisco Mint Superintendent John Daggett had the dimes struck for a group of banker friends, giving three to each. He also gave three to his young daughter Hallie, telling her to retain them until she was as old as he was, and she would be able to sell them for a good price. According to the story, she spent <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> dish of ice cream, but kept the other two until 1954. One of the approximately nine known dimes was retrieved from circulation in 1957, and Breen speculated this may have been the ice cream specimen. One sold for $1,552,500 at auction in 2007.|$|E
