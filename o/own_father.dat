5|$|In his (1991) novel Roman Blood, Steven Saylor renders a fictionalized, yet informed, {{rendition}} {{of how the}} Roman punishment poena cullei might occur. The reference to the punishment is in connection with Cicero's (historically correct, and successful) endeavours to acquit Sextus Roscius of the charge of having murdered his <b>own</b> <b>father.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Jen Kamerman {{and was the first}} episode Dana Gould wrote for The Simpsons. Gould based the part about Homer's bar on his <b>own</b> <b>father,</b> who opened a hunting club in order to sell alcohol without having to acquire a liquor license. The episode featured the musical group R.E.M., who appeared as themselves. It received mixed reviews from critics following the thirteenth season's release on DVD and Blu-ray.|$|E
5|$|Banned {{from the}} palace and shunned by his <b>own</b> <b>father,</b> {{for the next}} several years the Prince of Wales was {{identified}} with opposition to George I's policies, which included measures designed to increase religious freedom in Great Britain and expand Hanover's German territories at the expense of Sweden. His new London residence, Leicester House, became a frequent meeting place for his father's political opponents, including Sir Robert Walpole and Viscount Townshend, who had left the government in 1717.|$|E
5|$|Eorpwald {{was the son}} of Rædwald by a wife {{whose name}} is not recorded. He had at least one brother, Rægenhere, and another sibling, Sigeberht, may also have been his brother. Rædwald used the letters R and E when naming two of his own sons, (as did his <b>own</b> <b>father</b> when he and his younger brother Eni were named), which {{suggests}} that Eorpwald was the younger sibling and would only have become Rædwald's heir after his elder brother Rægenhere was slain in battle in 616.|$|E

5|$|Hogarth {{was well}} acquainted with the struggles of the Grub Street hack though, through the travails of his <b>own</b> <b>father,</b> Richard, who {{had been unable to}} make a living as writer and had {{eventually}} ended up at the Fleet Prison as a bankrupt. Hogarth may have been more than sympathetic to the dunce struggling with his rhymes. Jenny Uglow in her biography of Hogarth, posits that the gradual alteration of the prints above the poet's head could suggest a slow softening of attitudes towards Pope and his attack on the class of writer to which Hogarth's father had belonged, and perhaps evidence of Hogarth making his own compromises in his endeavours to become successful.|$|E
5|$|Joseph's role in {{the show}} is that of troubled surgeon – the {{resultant}} angst of his brother's attempted suicide and his own anally retentive personality lead to the revelation the character suffers from Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD).

When Lisa's aunt, Linda, arrives at Karin's house to retrieve her niece, she is attacked and killed by an unseen force as tree branches sway in the wind above her.

5|$|The film also explores father-son relationships, {{not only}} between Michael Sullivan and his son, but between Sullivan and his boss, John Rooney, and between Rooney and Connor. Sullivan {{simultaneously}} idolizes and fears Rooney, and Sullivan's son {{feels the same}} about his <b>own</b> <b>father.</b> Rooney's son, Connor, has none of Sullivan's redeeming qualities, and Rooney is conflicted about whom to protect: his biological son or his surrogate son. Connor is jealous of his father's relationship with Sullivan, which fuels his actions, ultimately causing a domino effect that drives the film.|$|E

5|$|The fourth Playford, {{father of}} Sir Thomas, {{was born in}} 1861. Unlike his <b>own</b> <b>father</b> and grandfather, who had led lives as soldiers, churchmen and politicians, he became a simple farmer at the Norton Summit {{property}} and was dominated by his wife, Elizabeth. He was, like his forebears, a regular churchgoer, and only once was involved in politics with a short stint on the East Torrens District Council. In comparison, Elizabeth was the local correspondent of The Advertiser, treasurer and chief member of the local Baptist Church, and a teacher. Four children were born to the couple; three daughters and one son, Sir Thomas.|$|E
5|$|Various {{candidates}} were put forward {{as a possible}} wife for Ernest. His <b>own</b> <b>father</b> wanted him to look high-up for a wife, such as a Russian grand duchess. One possibility was Princess Clémentine of Orléans, a daughter of Louis Philippe I, whom he met while visiting the court at the Tuileries. Such a marriage would have required his conversion from Lutheranism to Roman Catholicism however, and consequently nothing came of it. She later married his cousin Prince August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Ernest was also considered by Dowager Queen Maria Christina as a possible husband for her young daughter Isabella II of Spain, and by Queen Victoria for her cousin Princess Augusta of Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|Vespasian moved {{rapidly to}} Egypt, leaving the Jewish war {{under the command}} of Titus. At the same time Alexander, as a proven {{commander}} with experience of Jewish affairs, was sent by Vespasian to join Titus as his chief of staff and adviser, second only to Titus himself. By April 70, Jerusalem was under siege by four legions, and even after the city walls were overcome, the defenders held out in the Temple. Alexander, the offspring of a pious Jewish family, whose <b>own</b> <b>father</b> had donated the gold and silver for the Temple gates, now found himself in a position of command against his former brothers in that very sanctuary.|$|E

5|$|As in {{his other}} films, von Stroheim used Christian imagery and symbols, such as crosses and churches. Trina first shows signs of greed on Easter Sunday and is murdered by McTeague on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve was often {{depicted}} in von Stroheim's films and {{was close to the}} date of his father's death. Lennig asserted that the character of McTeague's father (who was only briefly mentioned in the novel) is based on von Stroheim's <b>own</b> <b>father,</b> while McTeague's mother is a tribute to von Stroheim's mother, to whom Greed is dedicated. Von Stroheim stated that he considered all of his good qualities to have come from his mother and all of his bad qualities to have come from his father.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{had never}} been {{particularly}} close to his parents, but his father's death in October 2000 and his mother's in March 2002 affected him deeply. Following the production of Planet of the Apes (2001), the director {{wanted to get back}} to making a smaller film. Burton enjoyed the script, feeling that it was the first unique story he was offered since Beetlejuice (1988). Burton also found appeal in the story's combination of an emotional drama with exaggerated tall tales, which allowed him to tell various stories of different genres. He signed to direct in April 2002, which prompted Richard D. Zanuck, who worked with Burton on Planet of the Apes, to join Big Fish as a producer. Zanuck also had a difficult relationship with his <b>own</b> <b>father,</b> Darryl F. Zanuck, who once fired him as head of production at 20th Century Fox.|$|E
