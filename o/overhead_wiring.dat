5|$|When {{conceived}} {{in the nineteenth}} century, the electric fire engine was proposed to replace the steam fire engine in use at the time. It was to be constructed {{in such a way}} that it would use a supply of electrical power that came from a central station whereby electricity could be distributed to various covered stations and city supply points. This would require underground or <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> similar to that used for electric light, trolleys, and other power users of the time. It was thought that the wiring could supply electricity to various outlet posts at strategic places throughout a city or fire protected district. These outlets would supply the necessary current to the fire-engine's electric motor. The vehicle itself was to be hauled by horses and would consist of a carriage wagon with an electric motor-powered water pump permanently mounted atop. There would be cables from the motor that would connect to the outlet post to obtain the required supply of electrical current.|$|E

50|$|The French Culoz-Modane railway was {{electrified}} with 1500 V DC third rail, later {{converted to}} <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> {{at the same}} voltage. Stations had <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> from the beginning.|$|R

50|$|The Route Utilisation Strategy {{document}} makes note of {{the benefits}} of dual-voltage electric multiple-unit trains that could be used both on the third-rail Merseyrail network and on future electrified lines using <b>overhead</b> <b>wires.</b> All new third-rail rolling stock must be capable of simple conversion to the <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> 25kV electrical supply system, so any future rolling stock on the Merseyrail DC third-rail lines will have provision for an <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> pantograph.|$|R

25|$|The {{line was}} opened in 1911 {{to serve the}} Mont Park Asylum complex, with the {{construction}} expense met by the government Health Department. Electrification on the line was commissioned on 14 September 1928, five years after that on the main line. Steel stanchions were used to support the <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring,</b> {{in contrast to the}} wooden posts then used on single lines of railway in Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, when {{passenger}} transport was deregulated, there was {{speculation about the}} future of the Cable Car. Councils could no longer provide transport services directly, having to either privatise or corporatise their operations. The City Council sold its bus operation, but due to public pressure it retained ownership of the Cable Car and the trolleybus <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring,</b> with operations and maintenance contracted out separately.|$|E
25|$|S-trains run on standard-gauge {{tracks and}} are powered via <b>overhead</b> <b>wires.</b> The voltage is 1,500 or 1,650 volts DC (negative <b>overhead</b> <b>wire),</b> {{indicating}} that it varies considerably with the loading and distance from a feeder station. Power {{is drawn from}} the national grid through 38 feeder stations. They have to be relatively {{close to each other}} because the large currents in the <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> (caused by the relatively low voltage) would lead to unacceptably large transmission losses otherwise.|$|R
50|$|The Sihltal Zürich Uetliberg Bahn has {{two lines}} with {{different}} electrification. To {{be able to}} use different electric systems on shared tracks, the Sihltal line has its <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> right above the train, whilst the Uetliberg line has its <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> off to one side.|$|R

25|$|The track {{rationalisation}} itself cost $40 {{million with}} 53 operating lines between Flinders Street and Richmond {{were reduced to}} just 12. The number of points was also reduced, from 164 to 48 and 1 in 9 and 1 in 15 points were used to permit higher speeds. New lower profile masts were installed to support the <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring,</b> and a new electrical substation erected to supply power to the trains. The main area of new track was between Flinders Street Station, Richmond Junction and the City Loop portals.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} three level crossings where trams and trains cross each other: Glenferrie Road, Kooyong; Glen Huntly Road, Glen Huntly; and Riversdale Road, Camberwell. To accommodate the differing voltages of the 600-volt tram and 1500-volt train systems {{each of these}} level crossings is fitted with an overhead square, which can isolate the section of <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> above the crossing and apply the appropriate voltage. When the signal box adjacent to the crossing interlocks the gates for trains to pass through, 1500 volts is applied, while when the gates are up 600 volts is applied.|$|E
25|$|In 1899 550V <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> was {{installed}} and the conduit removed. In 1900 {{the line was}} extended north to Gynn Square where it linked up with the Blackpool and Fleetwood Tramroad. In 1901 the Marton loop was opened, connecting Talbot Square and Central Station along Church Street, Devonshire Square, Whitegate Drive, Waterloo Road and Central Drive. A new depot was built on Whitegate Drive in Marton. A line was added from Talbot Square along Talbot Road to Layton in 1902. By 1903 the promenade line had reached the Pleasure Beach.|$|E

50|$|The use of <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> allows {{higher power}} supply {{voltages}} to be used. Although <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> {{are more likely}} to be used on metro systems without many tunnels, an example of which is the Shanghai Metro, <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> are employed on some systems that are predominantly underground, as in Madrid. Lines that utilize street running while on the surface (such as Boston's Green Line) tend to derive power completely from <b>overhead</b> <b>wires,</b> both while traveling in a tunnel in the central city and at street level in the suburban areas, as a third rail would make the track unsafe for road vehicles, especially at level crossings. There are transit lines that make use of both rail and overhead power, with vehicles able to switch between the two (an example of this being in Rotterdam and formerly in Chicago).|$|R

25|$|In Melbourne, {{there are}} several level {{crossings}} where electrified train tracks cross roads with electrified tram tracks. These crossings are fitted with equipment to change the voltage supplied to the <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> depending on the vehicle using the crossing {{at that point in}} time. Trains are severely speed-limited across these intersections. Due partly to this complication, the Victorian Government under Premier Daniel Andrews has begun removing 50 of Melbourne's most dangerous and congested level crossings. This is due to deaths and accidents that have occurred in recent years. The removals are due to complete by 2022.|$|E
25|$|Work {{to upgrade}} the track and remove the <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> began in August 2010. The project {{received}} planning approval in February 2011. The extension was originally {{scheduled to open in}} 2012, but in September 2011 the newly elected O'Farrell Government announced that it would not open until 2014, and that the cost had risen from $120 million to $176 million. The Greenway walking and cycling path which was to run alongside much of the route was deferred. The new government blamed hasty planning by their predecessor for the delay and cost overruns, and the lack of an active transport masterplan for the deferral of the Greenway.|$|E
25|$|After 1948 the Inner Circle {{line was}} used {{exclusively}} for freight trains serving sidings {{along the line}} itself, and the goods yard {{at the end of}} the Fitzroy branch. The <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> for electric trains was dismantled in 1961. Only the main feeder cables needed for Epping (now South Morang) line trains, and for shunting at the Royal Park end, were retained. Significant changes occurred in 1965, when the line was singled and both legs of the triangle at the eastern end of the line were closed. This left just a single line from Royal Park to Fitzroy remaining for goods services. The line was officially closed on 31 July 1981.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, RTA {{undertook}} a complete {{renovation of the}} Green and Blue Lines, with new track, ballast, poles and <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring.</b> Existing stations were demolished and new stations constructed. The project necessitated closing the Green Line east of Shaker Square {{for most of the}} summer of 1980 and the Blue Line east of Shaker Square for most of the summer of 1981, with substitute bus shuttles and single-tracking along the remainder of the line from East 55th Street to Shaker Square. To run on the renovated lines, a fleet of new LRVs were purchased from an Italian firm, Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie, to replace the aging PCC cars. The new lines were dedicated on October 30, 1981.|$|E
25|$|Eurostar {{owns and}} {{formerly}} operated two Class 73 locomotives, which were specially modified {{to enable them}} to haul a Eurostar unit. The two locomotives; 73118 and 73130, have additional coupling equipment fitted and were primarily used to rescue failed Eurostar sets, or to haul them over non-electrified routes. They were rarely used away from North Pole depot. When Eurostar moved its operations to the new Temple Mills depot and onto the <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> of High Speed 1 in 2007, the Class 73 locomotives became redundant and were loaned to educational initiatives: 73130 went to RailSchool in East London and 73118 went to Barry Rail Centre in South Wales. Subsequently, when RailSchool failed, 73130 was loaned to the Bluebell Railway but is stored away from the railway.|$|E
25|$|Trams {{or light}} rail cars {{equipped}} with pantographs normally cannot operate on lines with <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> designed for trolley-pole collection. For this reason, these systems {{and a few}} others worldwide retain use of trolley poles, even on new streetcars (except in Riga), {{in order to avoid the}} difficulty and expense of modifying long stretches of existing overhead wires to accept pantographs. However, the Toronto Transit Commission is converting streetcar overhead to be compatible with both trolley poles and pantographs. (The older CLRV and ALRV streetcars use only trolley poles while the newer Flexity Outlook are equipped for both trolley poles and pantographs.) Along Queens Quay West, since September 12, 2017, streetcars for route 510 Spadina use trolley poles while those for 509 Harbourfront use pantographs along the same section of track.|$|E

25|$|Blundell Street Depot {{opened in}} 1885 to house ten conduit trams. It was {{extended}} in 1894 and 1896 and in 1898 when {{the roof was}} raised to accommodate <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring.</b> After extension, the depot housed 45 trams on five tracks. The depot became a store in 1935 when the new central depot opened at Rigby Road. The inspection pits were filled in after World War II and after 1956 the building {{was used as a}} bus garage. The depot was reopened for trams in March 1963 after the closure of Marton depot. A new entrance was built in July 1964 but capacity was restricted by the presence of an ambulance station in the building. Following damage to the central roof caused by a gale, the depot was demolished on 4 November 1982.|$|E
25|$|However, on most railway {{vehicles}} using overhead wire, {{the trolley}} pole {{has given way}} to the bow collector or, later, the pantograph, a folding metal device that presses a wide contact pan against the overhead wire. While more complex than the trolley pole, the pantograph has the advantage of being almost free from dewiring, being more stable at high speed, and being easier to raise and lower automatically. Also, on double-ended trams, they eliminate the need to manually turn the trolley pole when changing direction (although this disadvantage can be overcome to some extent through the use of trolley reversers). The use of pantographs (or bow collectors) exclusively also eliminates the need for wire frogs (switches in the <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring)</b> to make sure the pole goes in the correct direction at junctions.|$|E
25|$|Between 1977 and 1979 (possibly at {{the time}} of Macleod-Greensborough duplication, '79) a 'back platform' was {{constructed}} at Macleod, the approach to which is approximately on the former Mont Park line alignment. It is a common misconception that the track into the back platform is the remaining section of the Mont Park line formerly used for stabling, {{but this is not the}} case, it does not curve in the same direction and is of a different gradient. At the same time as the back platform was constructed, three stabling sidings were built at the Up end. The back platform is not used for stabling, although it is often used as a head-shunt for the yard. The path of the line, beyond its crossing of Wungan Street at its intersection with Cherry Street, extends through the bushland adjacent to the Harry Pottage Memorial Park for several hundred metres, much of which is still reasonably visible, albeit overgrown. The only remains other than the alignment are the bases of several <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> poles, as well as one complete pole where the section of track retained for stabling once ended. Land formerly occupied by the Mont Park Asylum is now part of La Trobe University, and private housing developments.|$|E
5000|$|Safety or routing issues {{sometimes}} require Metro to [...] "motorize" [...] the trolleybus routes, operating {{them with}} diesel or hybrid diesel-electric buses. These substitutions usually occur {{on weekends and}} are usually caused by maintenance on the <b>overhead</b> <b>wires,</b> construction projects near the <b>overhead</b> <b>wires,</b> or special events (such as parades or marathons) that require the routes to be detoured.|$|R
2500|$|The grooved {{trolley wheel}} was used on many large city systems through the 1940s and 1950s; it was {{generally}} used on systems with [...] "old" [...] style round cross sectional <b>overhead</b> <b>wire.</b> The trolley wheel was problematic at best; the circumferential contact of the grooved wheel bearing {{on the underside of}} the <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> provided minimal electrical contact and tended to arc excessively, increasing <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> wear [...] The newer sliding carbon trolley shoe was generally used with a newer grooved <b>overhead</b> trolley <b>wire</b> of a roughly [...] "figure 8" [...] cross section. The sliding trolley shoe provided better electrical contact (with a reduction in arcing), and it dramatically reduced <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> wear. Many systems began converting to the sliding trolley shoe in the 1920s; Milwaukee, Wisconsin converted its large system in the late 1920s. Curiously, Philadelphia did not convert its trolley wheels on its remaining streetcars until 1978. Although a streetcar with a trolley wheel may evoke an antique look, the trolley shoe is modern and more practical as well as economical.|$|R
