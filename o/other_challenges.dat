5|$|The {{attacks on}} the Southern Pictish Zone at Dunnottar and Dundurn {{represented}} {{a major threat to}} Ecgfrith's suzerainty. Ecgfrith was contending with <b>other</b> <b>challenges</b> to his overlordship. In June 684, countering a Gaelic-Briton alliance, he sent his armies, led by Berhtred, son of Beornhæth, to Brega in Ireland. Ecgfrith's force decimated the local population and destroyed many churches, actions which are treated with scorn by Bede.|$|E
5|$|While a {{contestant}} {{is in the}} vault, contestants who {{are waiting}} in the line play various mini-games. The games played include passing ten people in the line through a hula-hoop; if successful, those ten move straight {{to the beginning of}} the line. <b>Other</b> <b>challenges</b> include two teams of five working as a group to move a beach ball across a track and offering random contestants the opportunity to open a red envelope that can send them to the beginning or end of the line.|$|E

25|$|According to the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, Ivory Coast devotes about 0.13% of GDP to GERD.

25|$|<b>Other</b> <b>challenges</b> {{included}} existing subway tunnels {{crossing the}} path of the underground highway. To build slurry walls past these tunnels, it was necessary to dig beneath the tunnels and to build an underground concrete bridge to support the tunnels' weight, without interrupting rail service.|$|E
25|$|Ascorbic acid is used {{to prevent}} {{multiple}} organ failure and to lessen mortality and morbidity in intensive care units. It thus appears reasonable to include sufficient doses of ascorbic acid to the treatment protocol during stresses and <b>other</b> <b>challenges</b> to growth in order to stimulate collagen synthesis and thus prevent lysine breakdown.|$|E
25|$|A further {{difficulty}} is {{presented by the}} shortage of trained health-care workers for tuberculosis control. CDC facilities are being rebuilt across the country but many are staffed inadequately or by poorly trained and unmotivated health-care workers. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, is the challenge of sustaining and further increasing long-term governmental commitment to the control of tuberculosis, which is essential to tackle the <b>other</b> <b>challenges.</b>|$|E

25|$|As {{part of a}} {{joint venture}} with Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company, Volvo {{converted}} two Volvo V70 to diesel-electric plug-in hybrid demonstrators that have been in field testing in Göteborg, Sweden, since December 2009. Vattenfall offered customers participating in this trial the supply of renewable electricity generated from wind power or hydropower. Among <b>other</b> <b>challenges,</b> this test has allowed to experience the all-electric range at low temperatures, which has been a disadvantage of plug-in vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Plimpton's classic The Bogey Man chronicles {{his attempt}} to play {{professional}} golf on the PGA Tour during the Nicklaus and Palmer era of the 1960s.

25|$|Water {{supplies}} are adequate {{to meet the}} demands of all sectors; however, the {{supplies are}} not located close to where most of the population lives. This has created inconsistent delivery of water to the citizens and has fostered new efforts at improving the water delivery systems of Jamaica. <b>Other</b> <b>challenges</b> include the lack of clear communication and effective coordination between the relevant water management institutions, however, efforts are being made here as well to improve on this deficiency.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} {{impressive}} {{growth in the}} Gross domestic product (GDP), low inflation, moderate interest rates and an acceptable unemployment level, Costa Rica in 2017 was facing a liquidity crisis due to a growing debt and budget deficit.

25|$|Ludvig was {{a pioneer}} in the {{development}} of early oil tankers. He first experimented with carrying oil in bulk on single-hulled barges. Turning his attention to self-propelled tankships, he faced a number of challenges.

25|$|Banks {{also face}} {{a host of}} <b>other</b> <b>challenges</b> such as ageing {{ownership}} groups. Across the country, many banks’ management teams and board of directors are ageing. Banks also face ongoing pressure by shareholders, both public and private, to achieve earnings and growth projections. Regulators place added pressure on banks to manage the various categories of risk. Banking is also an extremely competitive industry. Competing in the financial services industry has become tougher with the entrance of such players as insurance agencies, credit unions, cheque cashing services, credit card companies, etc.|$|E
25|$|Blues as a genre is also {{characterized}} by its lyrics, bass lines, and instrumentation. Early traditional blues verses {{consisted of a}} single line repeated four times. It {{was only in the}} first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard: the AAB pattern, consisting of a line sung over the four first bars, its repetition over the next four, and then a longer concluding line over the last bars. Early blues frequently took the form of a loose narrative, often relating the racial discrimination and <b>other</b> <b>challenges</b> experienced by African-Americans.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposal}} for an Assyrian self-administered zone {{established in the}} environs of Mosul, extending to Dohuk {{in the north and}} Fesh Khabur to the northwest has gained increasing appeal among Assyrian activists, intellectuals, and political leaders. The current political challenges facing Assyrians in the newly developing Iraq include rising Islamic pressure, gross under representation of Assyrians, and a sometimes callous misrepresentation of Assyrians simply as a Christian minority without reference to the Assyrian political, cultural, and nationalist platform. As Mr. Jatou reflected, the increasing Islamic fervor as well as <b>other</b> <b>challenges</b> in Iraq necessitate the establishment of an administrative area for Assyrians and Yezidis.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the essays}} uphold the {{traditional}} {{view that the}} Torah is the divine word of God, while <b>others</b> <b>challenge</b> it and question the historicity {{of some of the}} biblical narratives. This has raised objections, among Orthodox circles, to the publication.|$|R
