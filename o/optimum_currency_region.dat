40|$|Since the 1997 Asian {{financial}} crisis, {{a popular}} view among academic economists and policymakers is that developing countries with open capital accounts {{have only two}} options in their exchange rate regimes: either float the exchange rate freely or fix it hard. Within a fixed exchange rate regime, two variants can be conceived: (i) a currency board arrangement or its equivalent, the domestic usage of the currency of another country; and (ii) adoption of a new common currency {{by a group of}} countries, or the formation of a monetary union. This paper assesses {{the costs and benefits of}} the second variant for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The paper concludes that although the constraints on the adoption of a common currency by ASEAN are formidable, the long-run goal of a common <b>currency</b> for the <b>region</b> may be worth considering seriously, especially because, judged by the criterion of <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> area, the <b>region</b> is as suitable for the adoption of a common currency as Europe was prior to the Maastricht Treaty. ...|$|R
500|$|In economics, an <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> area, or <b>region</b> (OCA or OCR), is a {{geographical}} region {{in which it}} would maximise economic efficiency to have the entire region share a single currency. There are two models, both proposed by Robert Mundell: the stationary expectations model and the international risk sharing model. Mundell himself advocates the international risk sharing model and thus concludes in favour of the euro. However, even before {{the creation of the}} single currency, there were concerns over diverging economies. Before the late-2000s recession the chances of a state leaving the euro, or the chances that the whole zone would collapse, were considered extremely slim. However the Greek government-debt crisis led to former British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw claiming the eurozone could not last in its current form. Part of the problem seems to be the rules that were created when the euro was set up. John Lanchester, writing for The New Yorker, explains it: ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide {{a survey of}} the <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> area theory, {{estimate}} the degree of the explanatory power of the <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> area criteria, and also calculate the <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> area index {{in the case of the}} Czech Republic. The results indicate that the traditional <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> area criteria to certain extent explain exchange rate variability. Our results may be interpreted as an attempt to assess the benefit-cost ratio of implementing a common currency for a pair of countries. Our results also suggest that from the point of view of the <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> area theory the costs of adopting the euro for the Czech Republic may be relatively low, at least in comparison with other EMU member countries. We conclude that if the European Monetary Union is sustainable, the accession of the Czech Republic should not change it.

40|$|The paper investigates {{whether the}} East African Community, {{comprising}} of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, constitutes an <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> area or not. The East African Community has been revived, {{and one of}} the long-term objectives of the Community is to have a common currency. The paper employs the Generalised Purchasing Power Parity method, and various criteria suggested by the theory of <b>Optimum</b> <b>Currency</b> Areas to investigate the optimality of the Community as a currency area. While the various indices that we calculated based on the theory of <b>Optimum</b> <b>Currency</b> Areas gave mixed verdicts, the Generalised Purchasing Power Parity (G-PPP) method supports the formation of a currency union in the region. Using the G-PPP method, we were able to establish cointegration between the real exchange rates in East Africa for the period 1981 to 1998, and even for the period 1990 to 1998. This finding suggests that the three countries tend to be affected by similar shocks. <b>Optimum</b> <b>Currency</b> Area; Cointegration; Purchasing Power Parity; East Africa; Kenya; Tanzania; Uganda. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the viability of}} the Caribbean Market Economies (CME) as an <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> area. A vector error correction model is used with cointegration as an identifying restriction to decompose real output, prices and exchange rate into supply, demand and monetary shocks. Respective shocks are then tested for symmetry between countries to assess their suitability in meeting the <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> area (OCA) criteria. The US is used to capture global effects in assessing the convergence of the optimum OCA criteria. It is then used as a yardstick to compare size of shocks and speed of adjustment to those shocks to determine {{the viability of the}} CME as an <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> area. Shocking results from impulse response functions show that the Eastern Caribbean Currency Area (ECCA) members meet the OCA convergence criteria better than the non-ECCA members. However, the overall results depict that the Caribbean Community are not a suitable OCA as some of their correlation results are asymmetrical, and have large size of shocks and slow speed of adjustment relative to the US.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the Eurozone and give {{an answer to the}} question: Can Europe become an <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> area? Our {{analysis}} is based on theory structured in the form of several criteria for an <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> area, which we compare with our findings from the Eurozone. Our result shows that the Eurozone does not satisfy the criteria of high-factor mobility or wage flexibility. This is due to low-labour mobility and wage rigidity (wage rigidity is especially a concern for the northern countries). Another challenge faced by the Eurozone is the control of member government spending and economic stability through the Stability and Growth Pact. Our result further shows an increase in intra-trade in Europe, since the implementation of the Euro, which can be an important trend for the development of an <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> area...|$|R

40|$|Summary In this paper, {{we explore}} the {{features}} of the CFA franc zone and compare them to those of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) by operationalizing the criteria for an <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> area. A structural vector autoregression method is used in modeling national outputs as determined by global, regional, and country-specific shocks. We find that domestic outputs of the CFA franc zone countries are strongly influenced by country-specific shocks while regional shocks are far more important in European countries that have joined the EMU. The results suggest that the CFA franc zone countries are structurally different from each other and thus {{are more likely to be}} subjected to asymmetric shocks. They do not appear to form an <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> area and the monetary union may have been a costly arrangement for the member countries unless they are compensated with some other benefits.
