5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, {{new housing}} estates were built north-west of the town. This was {{followed}} by the redevelopment of the town centre in the 1960s and 1970s, which destroyed much of the <b>old</b> <b>high</b> street. There was speculation that the town's population could increase to around 55–60,000 by 1970. This did not happen: a decline in the linoleum industry in the mid-1960s led to a decrease in population, from a peak of 53,750 in 1961 to 47,962 in 1981.|$|E

5|$|The Modern English noun Valhalla {{derives from}} Old Norse Valhöll, a {{compound}} noun {{composed of two}} elements: the masculine noun valr 'the slain' and the feminine noun höll 'hall'. Valr has cognates in other Germanic languages such as Old English wæl 'the slain, slaughter, carnage', Old Saxon wal-dād 'murder', <b>Old</b> <b>High</b> German 'battlefield, blood bath'. All of these forms descend from the Proto-Germanic masculine noun *walaz. Among related Old Norse concepts, valr also appears as the first element of the nouns valkyrja 'chooser of the slain, valkyrie' and Valfreyja, one of the goddess Freyja's several names.|$|E
5|$|The Old Norse {{feminine}} proper noun Hel {{is identical}} to the name of the location over which she rules, Old Norse Hel. The word has cognates in all branches of the Germanic languages, including Old English hell (and thus Modern English hell), Old Frisian helle, Old Saxon hellia, <b>Old</b> <b>High</b> German hella, and Gothic halja. All forms ultimately derive from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic feminine noun *xaljō or *haljō ('concealed place, the underworld'). In turn, the Proto-Germanic form derives from the o-grade form of the Proto-Indo-European root *kel-, *kol-: 'to cover, conceal, save'.|$|E

5|$|Theories {{have been}} {{proposed}} about the relation between Ragnarök and the 9th century <b>Old</b> <b>High</b> German epic poem Muspilli about the Christian Last Judgment, where the word Muspille appears, and the 9th century Old Saxon epic poem Heliand {{about the life of}} Christ, where various other forms of the word appear. In both sources, the word is used to signify {{the end of the world}} through fire. Old Norse forms of the term also appear throughout accounts of Ragnarök, where the world is also consumed in flames, and, though various theories exist about the meaning and origins of the term, its etymology has not been solved.|$|E
5|$|Collier {{grew up in}} Paris, Kentucky and {{attended}} Paris High School. After graduating from Georgetown College, {{he returned to his}} <b>old</b> <b>high</b> school to teach and coach sports for 16 years. Collier left the position to join the U.S. Navy in 1943 during World War II. At a naval base outside of Chicago he met Paul Brown, who was coaching a service football team there. After the war, Brown hired Collier as an assistant coach for the Browns, a team under formation in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). After seven years as Brown's top aide, a span over which the Cleveland team won five league championships, Collier took a job as head football coach at Kentucky in 1954. His Kentucky Wildcats teams amassed a 41–36–3 win-loss-tie record over eight seasons.|$|E

50|$|Similar to humans, social {{structure}} {{plays an important}} role in cultural transmission in chimpanzees. Victoria Horner conducted an experiment where an <b>older,</b> <b>higher</b> ranking individual and a younger, lower ranking individual were both taught the same task with only slight aesthetic modification. She found that chimpanzees tended to imitate the behaviors of the <b>older,</b> <b>higher</b> ranking chimpanzee as opposed to the younger, lower ranking individual when given a choice. It is believed that the <b>older</b> <b>higher</b> ranking individual had gained a level of 'prestige' within the group. This research demonstrates that culturally transmitted behaviors are often learned from individuals that are respected by the group.|$|R
