5|$|American missionaries were {{threatened}} with death when the Boxer Rebellion menaced foreigners in China. Americans and other westerners in Peking were besieged and, {{in cooperation with}} other western powers, McKinley ordered 5000 troops to the city in June 1900 in the China Relief Expedition. The westerners were rescued the next month, but several Congressional Democrats objected to McKinley dispatching troops without consulting the legislature. McKinley's actions set a precedent that led to most of his successors exerting similar independent control over the military. After the rebellion ended, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to the Open Door policy, which became the basis <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>policy</b> toward China.|$|E

This Act reversed over 200 years <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>policy</b> that would have otherwise eliminated the indigenous languages of the United States. This legislation gave support to tribal efforts to fund language education programs.|$|E
25|$|The destroyer-escort {{returned}} to the United States in early 1946 for shipyard overhaul at San Pedro, California. On 16 May, she once again departed for the South Pacific. Arriving at Kwajalein on 31 May, she provided power to that island until September. During her tenure there, a slight mishap occurred. A group of sailors while on leave left the ship and proceeded to burglarize a large liquor storehouse {{that was on the}} island. They were discovered by Marine MP's that were stationed on the island. None of them were apprehended, but it is known that those who committed the robbery were from the Marsh because a small dinghy belonging to the Marine Detachment was stolen that night as well, and tied up alongside the destroyer. The officer in charge of the division claimed that it was theirs and that the liquor had been stolen by sailors on board the Marsh. The captain of the vessel staunchly denied the claims. No arrests were made and the small dinghy remained with the Marsh at least until 1947. She then sailed for Guam where she received orders for Tsingtao and Fusan, Korea where the 7th Fleet lent support to the aims <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>policy</b> in China and in the United States occupation zone of Korea.|$|E

500|$|In January 1977, {{four years}} prior to {{becoming}} president, Ronald Reagan bluntly stated, {{in a conversation with}} Richard V. Allen, his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War. [...] "My idea <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>policy</b> toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic," [...] he said. [...] "It is this: We win and they lose. What do you think of that?" [...] In 1980, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere. Both Reagan and new British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the Soviet Union and its ideology. Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an [...] "evil empire" [...] and predicted that Communism would be left on the [...] "ash heap of history," [...] while Thatcher inculpated the Soviets as [...] "bent on world dominance." ...|$|E
500|$|By fall 1970, McCain {{worried that}} Kissinger's plan for {{extensive}} commitment of South Vietnamese troops {{to preserve the}} Cambodian regime would endanger the progress of Vietnamization. [...] Nevertheless, McCain {{was involved in the}} intense U.S. effort to prop up Cambodian leader Lon Nol, paying visits to Phnom Penh to give him assurances and assess the state of the Cambodians. [...] When Lon Nol suffered a stroke in early 1971, he recuperated at McCain's guesthouse in Honolulu. [...] At the same time, a Military Equipment Delivery Team program was organized to supply military assistance to the Cambodian government. [...] McCain gained control of this effort (instead of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam), and to support a conflict that he proprietarily spoke of as [...] "my war", made constant requests to the Pentagon for more arms and staff. [...] He forced an Americanization of many logistics procedures within the Cambodian military. [...] He sided with Kissinger and the Joint Chiefs of Staff as they prevailed over the U.S. Embassy in Cambodia and U.S. Defense Secretary Melvin Laird in adopting a militarization <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>policy</b> with regard to that country. [...] Lon Nol's gratitude towards McCain continued, including the gift of an elephant (soon named [...] "Cincpachyderm") too large to transport on McCain's DC-6.|$|E

Mearsheimer argued that Russian intervention in Crimea and Ukraine had been motivated by what he saw as the irresponsible strategic objectives of NATO in Eastern Europe. He compared US-led NATO expansion into Eastern Europe and planned inclusion of Ukraine to the hypothetical scenario of a Chinese military alliance in North America, stating, [...] "Imagine the American outrage if China built an impressive military alliance and tried to include Canada and Mexico." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Reagan Doctrine was {{especially}} significant because it represented a substantial {{shift in the}} post–World War II foreign policy of the United States.

Kennan, John Foster Dulles, and other post–World War II U.S. foreign policy experts. In January 1977, four years prior to becoming president, Reagan bluntly stated, in a conversation with Richard V.

2500|$|Following the 1964 National Service Act, legislated in {{response}} to the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, 20-year-old Australian men were subject to military service based on a birthday lottery. In April 1965, Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies sent a battalion of Army regulars to Vietnam, beginning an overseas involvement in that country which lasted for seven years and provoked deeply divisive debate back home. In early 1966, Menzies retired and Harold Holt became Prime Minister. In March 1966, Holt announced troop increases bringing the total commitment to 4,500 men in Vietnam, a tripling of effort. Significantly, conscripts could now be sent into combat. Protests broke out, including a draft-card burning demonstration outside of Holt's home. In late June 1966 with President Lyndon B. Johnson listening, Holt spoke in Washington, D.C. in support <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>policy.</b> In his speech he closed by saying that Australia was a [...] "staunch friend" [...] of America, willing to go [...] "all the way with LBJ". This statement was widely criticized in Australia. Marxist writer and draft-card burner Andy Blunden said in July that, [...] "by following America into Vietnam, Holt's Australia is playing the role of Mussolini's Italy." [...] In December the government bolstered the Vietnam presence with 1,700 more troops.|$|E

60|$|This revenue act of 1767 {{formed the}} fourth period <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>policy.</b> How we have fared since then: what woful variety of schemes have been adopted; what enforcing, and what repealing; what bullying, and what submitting; what doing, and undoing; what straining, and what relaxing; what {{assemblies}} dissolved for not obeying, and called again without obedience; what troops {{sent out to}} quell resistance, and, on meeting that resistance, recalled; what shiftings, and changes, and jumblings {{of all kinds of}} men at home, which left no possibility of order, consistency, vigor, or even so much as a decent unity of color, in anyone public measure--It is a tedious, irksome task.

6000|$|New York {{has none}} of this {{adventitious}} aid. Both of the Governments, that of the United States {{and that of the}} State, have long been taken from her, leaving her nothing of this sort but her own local authorities. But representation forms no part of the machinery <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>policy.</b> It is supposed that man is too intellectual and philosophical to need it, in this intellectual and philosophical country, PAR EXCELLENCE. Although such is the theory, the whole struggle in private life is limited to the impression made by representation in the hands of individuals. That which the Government has improvidently cast aside, society has seized upon: and hundreds who have no claim to distinction beyond the possession of money, profit by the mistake to place themselves in positions perhaps that they are not always exactly qualified to fill. Of all social usurpations, that of mere money is the least tolerable--as one may have a very full purse with empty brains and vulgar tastes and habits. The wisdom of thus throwing the control of a feature of society, that is of much more moment than is commonly supposed, into the chapter of commercial accidents may well he questioned ...|$|E
