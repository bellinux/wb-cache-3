5|$|Crucially, {{both the}} Wartburg rally in 1817 and the Hambach Festival in 1832 had lacked any {{clear-cut}} program <b>of</b> <b>unification.</b> At Hambach, {{the positions of}} the many speakers illustrated their disparate agendas. Held together only by the idea <b>of</b> <b>unification,</b> their notions of how to achieve this did not include specific plans but instead rested on the nebulous idea that the Volk (the people), if properly educated, would bring about unification on their own. Grand speeches, flags, exuberant students, and picnic lunches did not translate into a new political, bureaucratic, or administrative apparatus. While many spoke about the need for a constitution, no such document appeared from the discussions. In 1848, nationalists sought to remedy that problem.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} element in nation-building, {{the story of the}} heroic past, fell to such nationalist German historians as the liberal constitutionalist Friedrich Dahlmann (1785–1860), his conservative student Heinrich von Treitschke (1834–1896), and others less conservative, such as Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) and Heinrich von Sybel (1817–1895), to name two. Dahlmann himself died before unification, but he laid the groundwork for the nationalist histories to come through his histories of the English and French revolutions, by casting these revolutions as fundamental to the construction of a nation, and Dahlmann himself viewed Prussia as the logical agent <b>of</b> <b>unification.</b>|$|E
5|$|Article 79 of the Constitution of Belarus {{gives the}} status of head of state to the President of the Republic of Belarus.

The President is the personification <b>of</b> <b>unification</b> of the Belarusian state when conducting foreign or internal affairs and shall be the main representative when dealing with other nations or international organizations. The President is also entrusted with the safety, prosperity and stability {{of the country and}} acts as an intermediary between the bodies of the national government.|$|E

We also give many functional equations and differential equations of this generating function. Using these equations, many properties <b>of</b> the <b>unification</b> <b>of</b> the Bernstein-type polynomials can be found. Section  3 : Integral representations <b>of</b> the <b>unification</b> <b>of</b> the Bernstein-type polynomials are given. Using these representations, we give an identity. Section  4 : By using the Laplace transform, we find some identities <b>of</b> the <b>unification</b> <b>of</b> the Bernstein-type polynomials. Section  5 : By {{using a new}} generating function, we prove the Marsden identity for the <b>unification</b> <b>of</b> the Bernstein-type polynomials. Section  6 : By using generating functions, we give relations between the <b>unification</b> <b>of</b> the Bernstein-type polynomial, the <b>unification</b> <b>of</b> the Bernoulli polynomial of higher order and the Stirling numbers of the second kind. Section  7 : By using the <b>unification</b> <b>of</b> the Bernstein-type polynomials and the Bernstein-Galerkin methods, we solve high even-order differential equations. Section  8 : We give some remarks on the <b>unification</b> <b>of</b> the Bernstein-type polynomials and Bezier-type curves.|$|R

5|$|Byrd was {{appointed}} to the post of assistant university president in 1918. He became a proponent <b>of</b> <b>unification</b> of the Maryland Agricultural College and the Baltimore professional schools into a single public University of Maryland, and he was instrumental in what became the Consolidation Act of 1920. Byrd named the student newspaper The Diamondback in 1921, and in 1933, he was the lead advocate for the adoption of the diamondback terrapin as the university's official nickname and mascot.|$|E
5|$|Pandora's Tower {{is set on}} {{the fictional}} {{continent}} of Imperia: once divided into ten kingdoms, the now-nomadic Vestra tribe were stripped of their kingdom. The dominant religion of Imperia is Aios, a polytheistic system worshiping nature as personified by twelve deities. Though once united through the ancient War <b>of</b> <b>Unification</b> which began the Unified Era, Imperia has seen recent conflicts as three kingdoms sought to break free from the powerful kingdom of Elyria.|$|E
5|$|By {{the years}} <b>of</b> <b>unification,</b> German Jews played an {{important}} role in the intellectual underpinnings of the German professional, intellectual, and social life. The expulsion of Jews from Russia in the 1880s and 1890s complicated integration into the German public sphere. Russian Jews arrived in north German cities in the thousands; considerably less educated and less affluent, their often dismal poverty dismayed many of the Germanized Jews. Many of the problems related to poverty (such as illness, overcrowded housing, unemployment, school absenteeism, refusal to learn German, etc.) emphasized their distinctiveness for not only the Christian Germans, but for the local Jewish populations as well.|$|E

5|$|For many, the Vatican's actions {{encapsulated}} {{all that}} {{was wrong with the}} Papal States and exposed pontifical rule as an anachronism. Several historians highlight the affair {{as one of the most}} significant events of Pius IX's papacy, and juxtapose his handling of it in 1858 with the loss of most of his territory a year later. The case notably altered the policy of the French Emperor Napoleon III, who shifted from opposing the movement for Italian unification to actively supporting it. The traditional Italian historiography <b>of</b> <b>unification</b> does not give much prominence to the Mortara case, which by the late 20th century was remembered mostly by Jewish scholars, but a 1997 study by the American historian David Kertzer has marked the start of a wider re-examination.|$|E
5|$|In {{earliest}} recorded history, Norway {{was divided}} {{into a number of}} small and sometimes warring petty kingdoms with weak central authority. In traditional historiography the rise of Harald Fairhair in the 9th century started the process <b>of</b> <b>unification</b> of the country and the consolidation of royal power. Harald's descendants, and other claimants to the throne, had to contend with strong regional leaders such as the Jarls of Lade in the north and the rulers of Vingulmark in the east, while the kings of Denmark claimed regions in the south and were eager to acquire Norwegian vassals to increase their influence. The spread of Christianity also became an increasingly important political issue in the late 10th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} to a unified state happened more gradually than ancient Egyptian writers represented, {{and there is no}} contemporary record of Menes. Some scholars now believe, however, that the mythical Menes may have been the pharaoh Narmer, who is depicted wearing royal regalia on the ceremonial Narmer Palette, in a symbolic act <b>of</b> <b>unification.</b> In the Early Dynastic Period about 3150BC, the first of the Dynastic pharaohs solidified control over lower Egypt by establishing a capital at Memphis, from which he could control the labour force and agriculture of the fertile delta region, as well as the lucrative and critical trade routes to the Levant. The increasing power and wealth of the pharaohs during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate mastaba tombs and mortuary cult structures at Abydos, which were used to celebrate the deified pharaoh after his death. The strong institution of kingship developed by the pharaohs served to legitimize state control over the land, labour, and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization.|$|E

25|$|After {{the advent}} <b>of</b> <b>unification</b> and the {{electro-pneumatic}} action, builders of church organs {{started to see}} the advantages of these systems. As a result, several organ builders began adopting these concepts for use in their church organs. Among these were Austin, Möller, Aeolian-Skinner and Kimball, who used electro-pneumatic action in many of their organs. Today, approximately one fourth of all new or rebuilt church pipe organs use an electro-pneumatic action either exclusively, or as an augmentation to existing tracker actions. In the same vein, some amount <b>of</b> <b>unification</b> was utilized in some church organs, and even today many church pipe organs utilize some degree <b>of</b> <b>unification</b> in areas where it is not critical to the classical sound sought in such instruments, or in instruments where space for pipes is limited. With stops such as the 32' bourdon in the pedal division, or a 16' reed in a manual division, the basic theatre organ concept of extension is commonly—but discreetly—used by even the most noted organ builders.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{scientific}} {{work is to}} understand more and more by less and less. In this effort, theoretical unification plays a large part.
