40|$|The {{ambulatory}} physician {{payment system}} in the German Social Health Insurance (SHI) offers incentives to reduce practice activity at the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>billing</b> period. Most services within a period are reimbursed at full cost only {{up to a certain}} threshold. Furthermore, capitated payments make follow-up treatments within <b>a</b> <b>billing</b> period less profitable. Using claims data from Germany's largest sickness fund with about nine million members, we find <b>a</b> decrease <b>of</b> all services limited by a threshold at the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>billing</b> period and <b>an</b> immediate increase {{at the beginning of the}} following period. For services that are not limited, we do not find an effect.

5|$|On 26 November 1897, details <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> {{proposed}} for the 1898 parliamentary session were published by the New Cross and Waterloo Railway (NC), an independent company promoted by James Heath MP, which planned two separate sections of tube line that would connect directly to the BS, extending the line south-east from Waterloo and east from around Marylebone Road.|$|E
5|$|Patton did {{not stop}} with the {{juvenile}} justice system, however. He encouraged passage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> that required that violent offenders serve at least 85percent of their sentences (up from the 50percent previously mandated), while requiring that judges consider home incarceration for first-time, non-violent offenders. The bill also allowed judges to sentence criminals to life without parole; previously, life without parole for 25years had been the harshest non-capital sentence. The bill passed the legislature in 1999.|$|E

5|$|The Office of the Special Prosecutor {{was founded}} {{with the passage}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> in the Icelandic {{parliament}} 10 December 2008. The aim was to investigate suspected criminal conduct leading up to, in connection with or {{in the wake of}} the banking crisis, whether these relate to the activities of financial undertakings, other legal entities or individuals, and, as appropriate, to follow up these investigations by bringing charges in court against those concerned.|$|E
5|$|A {{radical change}} of tactics, which {{involved}} the introduction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> to ban British subjects from aiding or {{participating in the}} slave trade to the French colonies, was suggested by maritime lawyer James Stephen. It was a shrewd move, since the majority of British ships were now flying American flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war. A bill was introduced {{and approved by the}} cabinet, and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-imposed silence, so as not to draw any attention to the effect of the bill. The approach proved successful, and the new Foreign Slave Trade Bill was quickly passed, and received royal assent on 23 May 1806.|$|E
5|$|Adams was {{concerned}} about the new Constitution and made an attempt to re-enter national politics. He allowed his name to be put forth as a candidate for the United States House of Representatives in the December 1788 election, but lost to Fisher Ames, apparently because Ames was a stronger supporter of the Constitution, a more popular position. Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to the Constitution, a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bill</b> of Rights in 1791. Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the Constitution, with these amendments and the possibility of more.|$|E

5|$|Combs also {{formed the}} state's first Human Rights Commission {{and ordered the}} {{desegregation}} of all public accommodations in Kentucky. The latter action was commended {{in a letter to}} Combs from President John F. Kennedy. In 1961, Combs was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Kentucky, and on February 17, 1962, he received an award from Keep America Beautiful for his work on cleaning up Kentucky's highways, including securing passage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> requiring that auto junkyards near major roadways be screened from view by fences.|$|E
5|$|Few at {{the time}} {{realized}} how important the issue would become, with the absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> of rights becoming the main argument of the anti-Federalists against ratification. Most of the Convention's delegates thought that states already protected individual rights, and that the Constitution did not authorize the national government to take away rights, {{so there was no}} need to include protections of rights. Once the Convention moved beyond this point, the delegates addressed a couple of last-minute issues. Importantly, they modified the language that required spending bills to originate in the House of Representatives and be flatly accepted or rejected, unmodified, by the Senate. The new language empowered the Senate to modify spending bills proposed by the House.|$|E
5|$|For the {{constitution}} to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for the addition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> of rights. Four state conventions proposed some form of restriction on {{the authority of the}} new federal government to conduct searches.|$|E

5|$|In 1809, Sharp {{was elected}} to {{represent}} Warren County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. During his tenure, he supported the legislature's election of Henry Clay to the U.S. Senate, {{the creation of a}} state lottery, and the creation of an academy in Barren County. He served on a number of committees, and for a time, served as interim speaker of the house during the General Assembly's second session. He was re-elected in 1810 and 1811. By 1810, the county had nearly 12,000 residents. During the 1811 session, Sharp worked with Ben Hardin to secure passage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> to ensure that state officers and attorneys at law would not be involved in dueling. He also opposed a measure allowing harsher treatment of slaves.|$|E
5|$|In Part II of the 1978 Spanish constitution, among {{provisions}} {{concerning the}} Crown, Article 62(a) invests the sanction (i.e. Royal Assent) and promulgation of laws with the monarch of Spain.

According to Article 91, the monarch shall give his or her assent and promulgate the new law within fifteen days of passage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> by the Cortes Generales. Article 92 invests the monarch {{with the right to}} call for a referendum, on the advice {{of the president of the}} government (commonly referred to in English as the prime minister) and the authorisation of the cortes.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's tenure on the Committee on Naval Affairs {{came during}} a time of great {{innovation}} in naval warfare. He kept abreast of developments in other navies, and he made sure that the U.S. Navy would incorporate the latest thinking into its new ships. Britain and France, then the two foremost navies in the world, {{were in the process of}} converting their fleets from sail to steam, and from paddles to screws. In 1853, the committee recommended passage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> providing for the addition of six new screw frigates to the fleet; when delivered, some considered them to be the best frigates in the world. In 1857, his committee persuaded the Senate to authorize twelve sloops-of-war. These entered the navy beginning in 1858, on the verge of the Civil War.|$|E

5|$|New Zealand is a {{constitutional}} monarchy with a parliamentary democracy, although its constitution is not codified. Elizabeth II is the Queen of New Zealand {{and the head}} of state. The Queen is represented by the Governor-General, whom she appoints on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Governor-General can exercise the Crown's prerogative powers, such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers, ambassadors and other key public officials, and in rare situations, the reserve powers (e.g. the power to dissolve Parliament or refuse the Royal Assent <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> into law). The powers of the Queen and the Governor-General are limited by constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of ministers.|$|E
5|$|Néstor Kirchner {{played an}} active role in the 2008 {{government}} conflict with the agricultural sector, when Cristina Kirchner introduced a new sliding-scale taxation system for agricultural exports that raised custom taxes to soybean exports to 44%. At that time, he became president of the Justicialist Party and publicly supported his wife in the conflict; Kirchner accused the agricultural sector of attempting a coup d'état. He spoke in support <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> to set the taxes by law at a demonstration at the Palace of the Argentine National Congress. Many senators who had supported the government rejected the proposal, and the voting was tied 36–36. Vice-President Julio Cobos, president of the Chamber of Senators, cast the decisive vote in opposition to the measure.|$|E
5|$|Of 234 {{representatives in}} the House, Breckinridge was one of 80 re-elected to the Thirty-third Congress. His {{relative}} seniority, and Pierce's election, increased his influence. He was rumored to have Pierce's backing for Speaker of the House, but he again deferred to Boyd; Maryland's Augustus R. Sollers spoiled Boyd's unanimous election by voting for Breckinridge. Still not given a committee chairmanship, {{he was assigned to}} the Ways and Means Committee, where he secured passage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> to cover overspending in fiscal year 1853–1854; {{it was the only time}} in his career that he solely managed a bill.
