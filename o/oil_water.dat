5|$|Nabulsi soap or sabon nabulsi {{is a type}} of castile soap {{produced}} only in Nablus and made of three primary ingredients: virgin olive <b>oil,</b> <b>water,</b> and a sodium compound. Since the 10th century, Nabulsi soap has enjoyed a reputation for being a fine product, and has been exported across the Arab world and to Europe. Though the number of soap factories decreased from a peak of thirty in the 19th century to only two today, efforts to preserve this important part of Palestinian and Nabulsi cultural heritage continue.|$|E

5|$|Like Castile soap, {{the chief}} {{ingredients}} of Nabulsi soap are virgin olive <b>oil,</b> <b>water,</b> and an alkaline sodium compound. The compound {{is made by}} mixing the powdered ashes of the barilla plant (qilw) which grows {{along the banks of}} the River Jordan with locally supplied lime (sheed). The sodium compound is then heated with water and the olive oil in large copper vats over fermentation pits. The solution of water and the sodium compound becomes increasingly concentrated in a series of 40 cycles repeated over eight days. During that time, an oar-shaped wooden tool known as a dukshab is used to stir the liquid soap continuously. The liquid soap is then spread in wooden frames to set. After setting, it is cut into the classic cube shape of Nabulsi soap and stamped with the company's trademark seal. The soap cubes then undergo a drying process which can last from three months to a year and involves stacking them in ceiling-high structures resembling cones with hollow centers which allow the air to circulate around the cubes.|$|E

40|$|The main {{theme of}} this paper is to assure the {{importance}} of natural material like peat to remove <b>oil</b> from <b>water.</b> Elimination of <b>oil</b> from the <b>water</b> is not a simple task. It requires some particular processes to separate <b>oil</b> from <b>water.</b> <b>Oil</b> in <b>water</b> is not only harmful for sea life but also the few manufacturing processes like dyeing and finishing of textiles cannot be carried out efficiently because of low absorbency. That is why it is very much important to remove <b>oil</b> from <b>water.</b> It is known that peat has outstanding absorbency qualities, since in its natural state is has absorbed approximately 90 % water, however, that on drying peat to approximately 5 - 10 % moisture content in the manner, such peat can absorb other liquid materials, like oil.

25|$|A typical {{formulation}} for commercially made mayonnaise (not low fat) {{can contain}} {{as much as}} 80% vegetable oil, usually soybean but sometimes olive <b>oil.</b> <b>Water</b> makes up about 7% to 8% and egg yolks about 6%. Some formulas use whole eggs instead of just yolks. The remaining ingredients include vinegar (4%), salt (1%), and sugar (1%). Low-fat formulas will typically decrease oil content to just 50% and increase water content to about 35%. Egg content is reduced to 4% and vinegar to 3%. Sugar is increased to 1.5% and salt lowered to 0.7%. Gums or thickeners (4%) are added to increase viscosity, improve texture, and ensure a stable emulsion.|$|E

6000|$|Against one thing, however, I must {{steadily}} caution you. All {{kinds of}} colour are equally illegitimate, {{if you think}} they will allow you to alter at your pleasure, or blunder at your ease. There is no vehicle or method of colour which admits of alteration or repentance; you must be right at once, or never; and you might as well hope to catch a rifle bullet in your hand, and put it straight, when it was going wrong, as to recover a tint once spoiled. The secret of all good colour in <b>oil,</b> <b>water,</b> or anything else, lies primarily in that sentence spoken to me by Mulready: [...] "Know what you have to do." [...] The process may be a long one, perhaps: you may have to ground with one colour; to touch it with fragments of a second; to crumble a third into the interstices; a fourth into the interstices of the third; to glaze the whole with a fifth; and to reinforce in points with a sixth: but whether you have one, or ten, or twenty processes to go through, you must go straight through them, knowingly and foreseeingly all the way; and if you get the thing once wrong, there is no hope for you but in washing or scraping boldly down to the white ground, and beginning again.|$|E
6000|$|We were {{approaching}} Zermatt; consequently, we {{were approaching}} the renowned Matterhorn. A month before, this mountain {{had been only}} a name to us, but latterly we had been moving through a steadily thickening double row of pictures of it, done in <b>oil,</b> <b>water,</b> chromo, wood, steel, copper, crayon, and photography, and so it had at length become a shape to us--and a very distinct, decided, and familiar one, too. We were expecting to recognize that mountain whenever or wherever we should run across it. We were not deceived. The monarch was far away when we first saw him, {{but there was no}} such thing as mistaking him. He has the rare peculiarity of standing by himself; he is peculiarly steep, too, and is also most oddly shaped. He towers into the sky like a colossal wedge, with the upper third of its blade bent a little to the left. The broad base of this monster wedge is planted upon a grand glacier-paved Alpine platform whose elevation is ten thousand feet above sea-level; as the wedge itself is some five thousand feet high, it follows that its apex is about fifteen thousand feet above sea-level. So the whole bulk of this stately piece of rock, this sky-cleaving monolith, is above the line of eternal snow. Yet while all its giant neighbors have the look of being built of solid snow, from their waists up, the Matterhorn stands black and naked and forbidding, the year round, or merely powdered or streaked with white in places, for its sides are so steep that the snow cannot stay there. Its strange form, its august isolation, and its majestic unkinship with its own kind, make it--so to speak--the Napoleon of the mountain world.
