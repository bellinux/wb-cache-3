5|$|Following Chicken Fries' discontinuation, {{there was}} a call for the product's {{reinstatement}} from fans <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> on forums such as Reddit; Business Insider noted that {{they are one of}} the 17 most requested fast products that people would like to see returned to menus. Fans <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> also established several social media accounts dedicated to Chicken Fries' return on Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. Additionally, a Change.org petition was created that called on Burger King to reinstate the product to its menu. Perez Hilton's web site declared that Chicken Fries are one product of many that will never come back, while comedian Daniel Tosh featured a skit during one of the segments of his show, Tosh.0, to the product's return. They were re-released in August 2014 as a limited time offering (LTO). The return <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> met with a favorable reaction from those who were advocating for Chicken Fries to return to the Burger King menu. There was disappointment from these groups as well because of the product's status as a limited time offering. In March 2015, Burger King permanently re-added Chicken Fries to the menu in a large, international menu expansion in thirty countries.|$|E
