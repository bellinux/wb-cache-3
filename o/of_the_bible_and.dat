5|$|Along {{with his}} {{scientific}} fame, Newton's studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>and</b> {{of the early}} Church Fathers were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture and Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John. He placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{left his}} brother-in-law's home {{a year later}} and went {{to live and work}} on a sheep farm. The family he lived with were devout Seventh Day Adventists.

5|$|Biblical Hebrew as {{preserved}} in the Hebrew Bible is composed of multiple linguistic layers. The consonantal skeleton of the text is the most ancient, while the vocalization and cantillation are later additions reflecting a later stage of the language. These additions were added after 600 CE; Hebrew had already ceased {{being used as a}} spoken language around 200 CE. Biblical Hebrew as reflected in the consonantal text <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>and</b> in extra-biblical inscriptions may be subdivided by era.|$|E

5|$|Christianity {{led to the}} {{development}} of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection between Church and State, a legacy of Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>and</b> classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others.|$|E

5|$|In September 1847 Busch began {{studying}} {{mechanical engineering at}} Hanover Polytechnic. Busch's biographers are not in agreement as to why his Hanover education ended; most believe {{that his father had}} little appreciation of his son's artistic inclination. Biographer Eva Weissweiler suspects that Kleine played a major role, and that other possible causes were Busch's friendship with an innkeeper, Brümmer, political debates in Brümmer's tavern, and Busch's reluctance to believe every word <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>and</b> catechism.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} religion, Protestant ideas first {{appeared}} {{in the middle of the}} 16th century. During Gáspár Heltai's service as preacher, Lutheranism grew in importance, as did the Swiss doctrine of Calvinism. By 1571, the Turda (Torda) Diet had adopted a more radical religion, Ferenc Dávid's Unitarianism, characterised by the free interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>and</b> denial of the dogma of the Trinity. Stephen Báthory founded a Catholic Jesuit academy in the city in order to promote an anti-Reform movement; however, it did not have much success. For a year, in 1600–1601, Cluj became part of the personal union of Michael the Brave. Under the Treaty of Carlowitz in 1699, it became part of the Habsburg Monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconography}} {{of the ceiling}} has had various interpretations in the past, some elements {{of which have been}} contradicted by modern scholarship. Others, such as the identity of the figures in the lunettes and spandrels, continue to defy interpretation. Modern scholars have sought, as yet unsuccessfully, to determine a written source of the theological program of the ceiling and have questioned {{whether or not it was}} entirely devised by the artist himself, who was both an avid reader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>and</b> a genius. Also of interest to some modern scholars is the question of how Michelangelo's own spiritual and psychological state is reflected in the iconography and the expression of the ceiling. One such speculation is that Michelangelo was tormented by conflict between homosexual desires and passionate Christian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|The {{provisions}} {{set forth}} in the Leges can be traced to laws of Cnut and various Anglo-Saxon codes. Some of the Anglo-Saxon codes used may have been subsequently lost. Also, certain legal terms used in the Leges, whether in their original English language or rendered into Latin, cannot be found in any extant legal code, and may be another example of preserving now-lost legal codes or provisions. It also draws upon non-English sources, including Isidore of Seville and Ivo of Chartres, as well as legal codes such as Frankish and canon law. Other sources include the Vulgate edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>and</b> Roman law codes, although the debt to those sources is small.|$|E

5|$|Though an {{absentee}} landlord, Leicester, who {{was also}} Baron of Denbigh, regarded the lordship {{as an integral part}} of a territorial base for a revived House of Dudley. He set about developing the town of Denbigh with large building projects; the church he planned, though, was never finished, being too ambitious. It would not only have been the largest, but also the first post-Reformation church in England and Wales built according to a plan where the preacher was to take the centre instead of the altar, thus stressing the importance of preaching in the Protestant Church. In vain Leicester tried to have the nearby episcopal see of St. Asaph transferred to Denbigh. He also encouraged and supported the translation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>and</b> the Common Prayer Book into Welsh.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius' {{understanding}} of the Arab peoples is informed by his reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>and</b> {{his knowledge of the}} history of imperial Rome. He {{does not appear to have}} personally known any Arabs. In his Chronicon, all the Arabs that appear—save for one reference to Ishmael—figure in the political history of the first three centuries of the Christian era. To Eusebius, the Saracens of the 4th century are direct-line descendants of the biblical Ishmaelites, descendants of the handmaid, Hagar, and the patriarch, Abraham. They are thus outcasts, beyond God's Covenant with the favored son of Abraham, Isaac. The twin images of the Ishmaelite and the Saracen—outcasts and latrones, raiders of the frontiers—reinforce each other and give Eusebius' portrait of the Arab nation an unhappy color. He may have been reluctant to associate the first Christian emperor with a people of such unfortunate ancestry.|$|E
5|$|George Frederic Watts {{was born}} in London in 1817, {{the son of a}} musical {{instrument}} manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823 and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Meanwhile, his father's strict evangelical Christianity led to both a deep knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>and</b> a strong dislike of organised religion. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and six years later was proficient enough as an artist to earn a living as a portrait painter and cricket illustrator. Aged 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. In 1837 Watts was commissioned by Greek shipping magnate Alexander Constantine Ionides to copy a portrait of his father by Samuel Lane; Ionides preferred Watts's version to the original and immediately commissioned two more paintings from him, allowing Watts to devote himself full-time to painting.|$|E

5|$|The Congregation elected Vermigli abbot of {{the monastery}} at San Pietro ad Aram, Naples in 1537. There he became acquainted with Juan de Valdés, {{a leader of the}} spirituali movement. Valdés {{introduced}} Vermigli to the writings of Protestant reformers. Toward the end of his time in Naples, he read Martin Bucer's commentaries on the Gospels and the Psalms, and Zwingli's De vera et falsa religione. Reading these works was an act of ecclesiastical defiance, but not an uncommon one in reformist circles. Vermigli seems to have slowly moved in a Protestant direction primarily through study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>and</b> the Church Fathers, especially Augustine. He probably read Protestant literature critically; it was common for those in reform-minded circles to do so while remaining in the Catholic Church. Vermigli embraced the Protestant doctrine of justification by faith alone during this time, and he had probably rejected the traditional Catholic view of the sacraments. Vermigli also seems to have influenced Valdés. Scholars believe that Valdés's strong doctrine of double predestination, that God has chosen some people for salvation and others for damnation, was learned from Vermigli. Vermigli in turn had acquired it from his study of Gregory of Rimini at Padua.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} Law marked {{the start of}} a new chapter for Smuts. The {{preceding}} years at Stellenbosch had been ones of tremendous intellectual development. From the narrow focus of his upbringing, his outlook had now expanded, awakening within him a consciousness of the breadth of knowledge now open before him. Smuts, though remaining an adherent of the Church, and respectful <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>and</b> its teachings, had developed a more questioning and critical outlook during the course of his studies. Whereas at the outset of his university career he was content to follow his parents' wishes and be ordained into the Church, as his time at Victoria College came to an end he found himself more and more unwilling to commit to this path. Though he had now as yet wholly rejected the idea of ordination, he wished for a period of more diversified study before making that decision. So it was that Smuts came to select Law, rather than Divinity or Philosophy - the logical choices for a future Minister of Religion.|$|E
5|$|The {{first version}} of the script attested is Asomtavruli which dates back to at least the 5th century; the other scripts were formed in the {{following}} centuries. Most scholars link {{the creation of the}} Georgian script to the process of Christianization of Iberia, a core Georgian kingdom of Kartli. The alphabet was therefore most probably created between the conversion of Iberia under King Mirian III (326 or 337) and the Bir el Qutt inscriptions of 430, contemporaneously with the Armenian alphabet. It was first used for translation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>and</b> other Christian literature into Georgian, by monks in Georgia and Palestine. Professor Levan Chilashvili's dating of fragmented Asomtavruli inscriptions, discovered by him at the ruined town of Nekresi, in Georgia's easternmost province of Kakheti, in the 1980s, to the 1st or 2nd century has not been accepted.|$|E
