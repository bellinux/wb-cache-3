This method simulates well the clogging behavior of open space of dam and the random effect of granular arrangement and/or size on clogging behavior.

40|$|<b>Open</b> <b>types</b> are {{presented}} as a simple yet powerful data model for statically typed procedural and object-oriented programming languages, that overcomes {{the limitations of the}} traditional record-oriented model. The basic idea is to separate type definitions from the definitions of their attributes in order to allow incremental definitions of the latter.

Finally, anonymous and automatic attributes {{are presented}} as a simple extension of attributes that unifies the concepts of aggregation, inheritance (including subtype polymorphism), and user-defined <b>type</b> conversions. Since <b>open</b> <b>types</b> do not possess methods in the objectoriented sense, global virtual functions are used as an alternative and more flexible means to define behaviour, while modules are employed to achieve information hiding and type-safe separate compilation.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} long-term renal outcomes after <b>open</b> <b>type</b> IV thoracoabdominal aneurysm (TAAA) repair. DesignRetrospective {{analysis of}} a prospectively collected database of consecutive operated non-ruptured type IV TAAAs (2007 – 2011). MethodsRenal function was analysed by serum creatinine concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) stage. The primary outcome was the change in creatinine concentration from before surgery to defined time points after surgery: peak postoperative; discharge; at follow-up (> 1 year postoperatively). Secondary outcomes were change in eGFR, change in KDOQI stage, dialysis requirement, and 30 -day mortality. ResultsBetween 2007 and 2011, 53 <b>open</b> <b>type</b> IV TAAA repairs were performed. Median creatinine levels significantly increased in the immediate postoperative period, but returned to baseline by discharge. Thirteen patients (28. 2 %) had an improvement in follow-up eGFR of at least 20 % compared with pre-operative eGFR or improved by one KDOQI stage. Twelve patients (26. 1 %) had a decline in eGFR of at least 20 % or one KDOQI stage at follow-up. Three patients (7. 5 %) required temporary dialysis and one patient (1. 9 %) required permanent dialysis. The 30 -day mortality was 1. 9 %. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates acceptable renal outcomes following <b>open</b> <b>type</b> IV TAAA repair. <b>Open</b> <b>type</b> IV repair remains the standard against which newer techniques should be compared...|$|R
