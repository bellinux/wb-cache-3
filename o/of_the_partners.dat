5|$|According to the {{instructions}} from the Ministry of Justice (Dirección General de Registros y Notariado), Spanish Consulates abroad may carry out the preliminary paperwork for a same-sex marriage. At {{least one of the}} marrying partners must be a Spanish citizen, residing in the Consular demarcation. However, the marriage itself can only take place at the Consulate if local laws recognize same-sex marriages. In all other cases, the partners must marry in Spanish territory. Two non-resident foreigners cannot marry in Spain, as at least one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>partners</b> must be a Spanish resident, although they both may be non-Spanish citizens.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{recommendation}} for demolition, in late 1995, the councillors {{of the newly}} formed City of Perth had a feasibility study carried out into whether Council House could be refurbished. This feasibility study {{was carried out by}} Architects Cox Howlett and Bailey, of which one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>partners</b> was the son of original designer Jeffrey Howlett, and cost $100,000. The study indicated that the building could be economically refurbished, and in December 1996 the Council unanimously agreed to press ahead with refurbishment plans, removing its asbestos and building an underground car park {{at the rear of the}} site. The decision to refurbish was helped by the fact that interest rates at the time were so low that it was cheaper to service a loan than to pay rent. At the time, the refurbishment was expected to cost around $26 million.|$|E
5|$|Gan {{was later}} taken as an {{apprentice}} by Guthrie and Company.

Gan was subsequently promoted to the post of Assistant Storekeeper and then Chief Storekeeper of the company. In 1874, he became the company's Chief Compradore, a position which he held for the next 25 years. Scott later helped to finance some of Gan's early business ventures, one of which was to supply labour and transport to the Tanjong Pagar Dock Company which helped Gan make most of his personal fortunes.|$|E

5|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} has been legal in Ireland since 16 November 2015. A referendum on 22 May 2015 amended the Constitution of Ireland {{to provide that}} marriage is recognised irrespective of the sex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>partners.</b> The measure {{was signed into law}} by the President of Ireland as the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland on 29 August 2015. The Marriage Act 2015, passed by the Oireachtas on 22 October 2015 and signed into law by the Presidential Commission on 29 October 2015, gave legislative effect to the amendment. Marriages of same-sex couples in Ireland began being recognised from 16 November 2015 and the first marriage ceremonies of same-sex couples in Ireland occurred on 17 November 2015.|$|E
5|$|Spanish bishops {{also claimed}} that the Government, by {{extending}} the right of marriage to same-sex couples, weakened the meaning of marriage, which they defined as an involving a heterosexual couple. The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of same-sex couples adopting and raising children, and argued that adoption is not a right for the parents, but for the adopted. Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by same-sex couples had existed {{for a long time}} in Spain, since many couples were rearing minors adopted by one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>partners.</b> Adoption by same-sex couples was already legal in Navarre (2000), the Basque Country (2003), Aragon (2004), Catalonia (2005) and Cantabria (2005) before the same-sex marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide. Furthermore, in Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002) and Extremadura (2003), same-sex couples could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children in care. These associations also argued that there was no scientific basis for the claim that the parents' sexual orientation would cause developmental problems for their adopted children. This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of Psychology, which also states that homosexuality is not a pathology.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{proposed}} high-risk transmission channels, {{allowing the}} virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout the society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to circa 1910. Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic {{with the emergence of}} colonialism and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of sexual promiscuity, the spread of prostitution, and the concomitant high frequency of genital ulcer diseases (such as syphilis) in nascent colonial cities. While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are typically low, they are increased many fold if one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>partners</b> suffers from a sexually transmitted infection resulting in genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable due to their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers to the degree that as of 1928 as many as 45% of female residents of eastern Leopoldville were thought to have been prostitutes and as of 1933 around 15% of all residents of the same city were infected by one of the forms of syphilis.|$|E

25|$|The Church does {{recognize}} that there are rare occasions when it is better that couples do separate, but there is no official recognition of civil divorces. For the Orthodox, to say that marriage is indissoluble means that it should not be broken, the violation of such a union, perceived as holy, being an offense resulting from either adultery or the prolonged absence of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>partners.</b> Thus, permitting remarriage is an act of compassion of the Church towards sinful man.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> mating {{behaviour}} <b>of</b> {{this species}} {{has been particularly}} well studied, partly to provide taxonomic characters. Mating starts when one individual closely follows <b>the</b> flattened tail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other (precourtship). Typically after some minutes the leader turns back and protrudes its sarcobelum (a tapering finger-like part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> penis), as does its <b>partner</b> shortly afterwards. <b>The</b> <b>partners</b> often form a circle head to tail. Early courtship involves violent biting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>partner,</b> lashing <b>the</b> sarcobelum against <b>the</b> <b>partner,</b> and bursts <b>of</b> tail wagging. This is gradually replaced by more gentle-looking stroking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sarcobelum across <b>the</b> <b>partner.</b> During courtship, sperm accumulates in the penial caecum. After about 90 minutes <b>the</b> <b>partners</b> orient themselves face-to-face, nibble <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>partner's</b> raised sarcobelum, and suddenly their penises simultaneously evert. The finger-like penial caecum curves round <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>partner's</b> sarcobelum, transferring sperm onto it. The penes remain everted for a variable period (typically some minutes) before the penial lobe and then the penial gland also evert. The latter transfers a secretion onto <b>the</b> <b>partner.</b> This is directly followed by retraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> penis (each <b>partner</b> thereby taking up the transferred sperm) and then separation.|$|R

25|$|A {{marriage}} {{in which both}} spouses agree ahead of time to accept sexual relations by either partner with others is {{sometimes referred to as}} an open marriage or the swinging lifestyle. Polyamory, meaning the practice, desire, or acceptance of intimate relationships that are not exclusive with respect to other sexual or intimate relationships, with knowledge and consent of everyone involved, sometimes involves such marriages. Swinging and open marriages are both a form of non-monogamy, and the spouses would not view the sexual relations as objectionable. However, irrespective of the stated views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>partners,</b> extra-marital relations could still be considered a crime in some legal jurisdictions which criminalize adultery.|$|E
25|$|During the Franco years, marriages {{had to be}} {{canonical}} (that is, performed under Roman Catholic law and regulations) if {{even one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>partners</b> was Catholic, which meant effectively that all marriages in Spain had to be sanctioned by the church. Since the church prohibited divorce, a marriage could be dissolved only through the arduous procedure of annulment, which was available only after a lengthy series of administrative steps and was thus accessible only to the relatively wealthy. These restrictions were {{probably one of the}} major reasons for a 1975 survey result showing that 71 percent of Spaniards favored legalizing divorce; however, because the government remained in the hands of conservatives until 1982, progress toward a divorce law was slow and full of conflict. In the summer of 1981, the Congress of Deputies (lower chamber of the Cortes Generales, or Spanish Parliament) finally approved a divorce law with the votes of about thirty Union of the Democratic Center (Union de Centro Democratico or UCD) deputies who defied the instructions of party conservatives. As a consequence, Spain had a divorce law that permitted the termination of a marriage in as little as two years following the legal separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>partners.</b> Still, it would be an exaggeration to say that the new divorce law opened a floodgate for the termination of marriages. Between the time the law went into effect at the beginning of September 1981, and the end of 1984, only slightly more than 69,000 couples had availed themselves of the option of ending their marriages, and the number declined in both 1983 and 1984. There were already more divorced people than this in Spain in 1981 before the law took effect.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} to {{civilian}} life, Macky resumed his legal career but maintained {{an interest in the}} military by joining the Territorial Force (TF). Previously a sole practitioner, he went into partnership with another solicitor in 1920. Much of the firm's work was in property conveyancing work and in 1928, Macky, having purchased his partner's share of the practice, merged his firm into what later became Russell McVeagh. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>partners</b> of the firm, like Macky, were officers in the TF. Macky was promoted to major in the TF in 1926 and to colonel in 1931, at which time he was in command of the Auckland Regiment. Six years later, he was appointed commander of the 1st New Zealand Infantry Brigade.|$|E
