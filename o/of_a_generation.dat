5|$|The {{desperation and}} the violent {{reaction}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> robbed of a safe future are well-represented by the British punk movement of 1977–1978, whose {{rebellion against the}} establishment continued diluted in the new wave and post-punk music of the 1980s. These self-proclaimed punks were politically militant, relishing their anarchic attitude and stage practices like pogo dancing. They wore short and spiked hairstyles or shaved heads, often with safety pins and ripped clothes, and considered musical prowess unimportant {{as long as the}} music was simple and loud. However, not all working-class male youths embraced the punk movement; some preferred to escape from their grim reality in heavy metal, which was equally effective in providing fun, stress relief, and peer companionship– otherwise denied because of their unemployment.|$|E

Second and third generation charged particles, on the other hand, decay with very short half lives, and are observed only in very high-energy environments. Neutrinos of all generations also do not decay, and pervade the universe, but rarely interact with baryonic matter.|$|E

25|$|Johnson won a {{scholarship}} to read Literae Humaniores, a four-year course based {{in the study of}} Classics, at Balliol College, Oxford. Arriving at the university in late 1983, he was part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> of Oxford undergraduates who later dominated British politics and media in the early 21st century, among them senior Conservative Party members David Cameron, William Hague, Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, and Nick Boles. At the university, he played rugby for Balliol, and associated primarily with Old Etonians, joining the Old Etonian-dominated Bullingdon Club, an upper-class drinking society known for its acts of local vandalism. Johnson entered into a relationship with the aristocrat Allegra Mostyn-Owen and they became engaged while at university.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} led to {{controversy and}} criticism {{from a number}} of media sources, including The Boston Globe, Los Angeles Times, Fox News, The San Francisco Chronicle, New York Times, CNN and The Boston Herald, some of which ridiculed the city's response to the devices as disproportionate and indicative <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> gap between city officials and the younger residents of Boston, at whom the ads were targeted. Several sources noted that the hundreds of officers in the Boston police department or city emergency planning office on scene were unable to identify the figure depicted for several hours until a younger staffer at Mayor Thomas Menino's office saw the media coverage and recognized the figures as cartoon characters from the TV show.|$|E

25|$|During {{periods of}} large {{migration}} in Australia, {{and with the}} possible help of strong winds, the Australian painted lady migrates across the sea to New Zealand. Multiple occurrences of this butterfly in New Zealand were reported in the 1960s. In the spring of 1968, they appeared on the western coast of New Zealand near the sea, and were unusually abundant. The species {{is unlikely to be}} established in New Zealand, as no instances of larvae or adults hibernating through the winter were found. Although some individuals reproduced and laid eggs, the larvae only developed to the first instar before development stopped. The same phenomenon occurred in the late summer 1969, and coincided with a gale-force westerly wind. This evidence suggests that the butterflies observed in the spring of 1968 and the summer of 1969 were the result of a new migration from Australia, and not the offspring <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> of previously migrated painted ladies. The migration of butterflies and moths from Australia is not uncommon in summers with strong winds.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} this {{revolution}} in art education were far-reaching. Over {{the course of the}} 1880s and 1890s the Birmingham School of Art became the focus <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> of distinguished designers, all of whom had studied there and most of whom went on to teach there, who became known as the Birmingham Group. This included the stained glass designers Henry Payne, Sidney Meteyard, Florence Camm and Bernard Sleigh; the wood engravers and book illustrators E. H. New and Charles March Gere; the jewellers and metalworkers Arthur Dixon, Arthur Gaskin and Georgie Gaskin; and the furniture designers Ernest Barnsley and Sidney Barnsley. The influence of the school's teaching also permeated beyond this inner circle, and important work in an Arts and Crafts style was also produced by organisations such as the Birmingham Guild of Handicraft, the Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts, the Kynoch Press and the Ruskin Pottery; and commercial firms such as the silversmiths A. E. Jones, the stained glass workshops of T. W. Camm and Co. and the metalworkers Henry Hope and Son.|$|E
25|$|Under her {{editorial}} management {{it proved}} the swiftest journalistic success on record, numbering its subscribers by the hundred thousand, and while other papers took {{a loss for}} granted in the beginning, putting itself upon a paying basis at the outset. While she had assistants in every department, among their names those of some most distinguished in our literature, she was herself the inspiration of the whole corps, and under the advice and suggestion of its proprietors she held it on an even course. There was scarcely a poet, or a story-writer, or novelist of any rank in America or England {{who is not a}} contributor to its pages, and its purity, its self-respect, its high standard, and its literary excellence, were unrivalled among periodical publications. The influence of such a paper within American homes was something hardly to be computed. It was always on the side of good and sweet things; it made the right seem the best and pleasantest; it taught while it has amused; it held the happiness, well-being, and virtue of women and the family as its first consideration, and it created a wholesome atmosphere wherever it was constantly read. Through its columns, its editor made her hand felt in countless families for nearly 16 years, and helped to shape the domestic ends <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> to peace and righteousness.|$|E
