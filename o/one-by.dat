It was not until the beginning of December 1941 that these issues were fully solved and the units were cleared for squadron use.|$|E

30|$|The {{answers to}} the {{question}} “Who {{is responsible for the}} regular inspections during retention period?” were divided into three camps: 53.1 % {{of the respondents indicated that}} the orthodontists are responsible for the regular inspections of retainers, whereas 40.7 %, the patients/their parents. The remaining respondents noted general dentists as an option. The orthodontists recommended three appointments during the first year for inspection of retainers (fixed <b>ones—by</b> 42.0 %; removable <b>ones—by</b> 30.0 %) and once per year after the 1 -year retention period (fixed <b>ones—by</b> 44.4 %; removable <b>ones—by</b> 40.7 %).|$|R
30|$|At a meso level, {{the main}} problem that arises is the {{question}} of the governance of food and the related policies, which occur at the level of particular urban—or better, metropolitan—agglomerates. The issue here is that of opening channels of communication among the various bubbles {{in such a way that}} forms of complementarity are established among them that guarantee greater sustainability of the food system in a part of the territory, accessibility to nutritional resources—or at least to the basic <b>ones—by</b> all social groups, and reinforcement of the resilience of the territorial system in the face of crises or other unforeseen events. This food governance also enables the relations among the various social groups to be strengthened, the more destructive conflicts to be prevented or mediated, and the level of cohesion among the parties, and between the parties and the environment, to be increased. One effect of this policy is also how it contributes to the identification of areas of the territory, which gives them a distinct identity compared with other areas, and ensures that they conform as urban systems (albeit open and mobile) that can be recognised both by those who are part of them and from the outside. Today, in fact, it is difficult to be able to recognise “natural” or historic borders that render the individuality of cities and territories incontrovertible and irreversible, but it is also true that this individuality, which is constantly being constructed and reconstructed, remains a factor of internal cohesion and advantage in global competition.|$|R

50|$|The cost of SIPs {{are higher}} than the {{materials}} for a comparable framed building in the United States; however, {{this may not be}} true elsewhere. A well-built home using SIPs will have a tighter building envelope and the walls will have higher insulating properties, which leads to fewer draughts and a decrease in operating costs. Also, due to the standardized and all-in-one nature of SIPs, construction time can be less than for a frame home, as well as requiring fewer tradespeople. The panels can be used as floor, wall, and roof, {{with the use of the}} panels as floors being of particular benefit when used above an uninsulated space below. As a result, the total life-cycle cost of a SIP-constructed building will, in general, be lower than for a conventional framed <b>one—by</b> as much as 40%. Whether the total construction cost (materials and labor) is lower than for conventional framing appears to depend on the circumstances, including local labor conditions and the degree to which the building design is optimized for one or the other technology.|$|E
30|$|The overall {{response}} rate was 75.7 %. All of the respondents prescribed retainers after the orthodontic therapy. More than 40 % of the respondents combined fixed and removable retainers in different clinical situations, but the first-choice option after {{an expansion of the}} maxillary dental arch was the removable retainer (54.3 %); meanwhile, a fixed retainer was used after a correction of any rotations of the mandibular anterior teeth (49.4 %). The Hawley retainer was preferred by 90.1 % of the respondents for a maxillary dental arch, and 74.1 % of them preferred it for a mandibular dental arch. The most preferable fixed retainer was the retainer bonded to all six anterior teeth (in the upper dental arch—by 71.6 %; in the lower <b>one—by</b> 80.2 %). There was no consensus on the duration of a retention period. Most of the orthodontists checked up retainers three times during the first year (fixed ones—by 42.0 %; removable ones—by 30.0 %) and once per year after the 1 -year retention period (fixed ones—by 44.4 %; removable ones—by 40.7 %). All orthodontists gave instructions for taking care of an orthodontic retainer. It was observed that the orthodontists with less than 10  years of experience used a protocol based on the skills learned during their postgraduate studies, while orthodontists with more than 10  years of experience used retention procedures based on their orthodontic work practice (p <  0.05).|$|E
30|$|Consider two {{countries}} {{with a similar}} per capita GDP in 1910, one of them with more natural resources and less physical capital than the other, in per capita terms. Call them Argentina and The Netherlands (actually, in 1910, their per capita incomes were the same and they both had a population between 6 and 7 million). By 1910, Argentina had already reached its agricultural frontier, so it perhaps appropriate to consider land a fixed factor—though not an exhaustible <b>one—by</b> that time. Imagine, moreover, a similar technology and savings rate, broadly defined. 5 If both countries have the same savings rate and the same per capita income, and assuming that they invest what they save (i.e., the closed economy case) in physical and human capital; then, they would both be adding {{the same amount of}} capital to their current stock. If both countries have the same rate of population growth, then capital per worker will be increasing by the same amount in both countries. However, because physical capital is initially lower in Argentina than The Netherlands, and if there are decreasing returns to capital, then Argentina’s income per worker should be growing more than that of The Netherlands. A resource-rich country (say, Argentina in 1910) could easily have higher capital productivity and, therefore, grow more than another country that is poorer but more capital intensive (say, Austria-Hungary in 1910). Standard growth theory models would predict that there could be divergence favouring the resource rich.|$|E
40|$|Against the {{prediction}} of the theorists of modernisation on the inescapable withering away of religion, it is back at the centre stage of international politics. Furthermore, this return appears to be antagonistic and {{does not seem to}} be for the (common) good. But how can we explain this visible resurgence of religion in world politics in the post-Cold War era? What can we say about the logic—if there is just <b>one—by</b> which religions interact, infuse or even ‘sacralise’ international politics today? These are questions of great topicality, especially in the light of how religion and politics have been recently interacting in both the Islamic and the Western world as well as in their precarious relationship. In this chapter, my starting point is that the resurgence of religion as a central factor in contemporary international relations is linked to the renewed visibility of the concept of civilisation in post-Cold War political discourses. More specifically, drawing on Johann P. Arnason’s recent work—and in this regard Samuel Huntington’s argument retains part of its validity—I want to argue that the resurgence of religions in world politics has to be read in the context of civilisations, defined in a fundamentally culturalist sense, reasserting themselves as strategic frames of references, not as direct protagonists, of international politics. This development also has to be read as part of a longer-term process of challenge to Western dominance that has intensified since the Second World War and which Hedley Bull called the ‘cultural revolt against the West’...|$|E
40|$|Great {{expectations}} are connected with application of indirect fetal electrocardiography (FECG), especially for home telemonitoring of pregnancy. Evaluation of fetal heart rate (FHR) variability, when determined from FECG, {{uses the same}} criteria as for FHR signal acquired classically-through ultrasound Doppler method (US). Therefore, the equivalence of those two methods has to be confirmed, {{both in terms of}} recognizing classical FHR patterns: baseline, accelerations/decelerations (A/D), long-term variability (LTV), as well as evaluating the FHR variability with beat-to-beat accuracy-short-term variability (STV). The research material consisted of recordings collected from 60 patients in physiological and complicated pregnancy. The FHR signals of at least 30 min duration were acquired dually, using two systems for fetal and maternal monitoring, based on US and FECG methods. Recordings were retrospectively divided into normal (41) and abnormal (19) fetal outcome. The complex process of data synchronization and validation was performed. Obtained low level of the signal loss (4. 5 % for US and 1. 8 % for FECG method) enabled to perform both direct comparison of FHR signals, as well as indirect <b>one-by</b> using clinically relevant parameters. Direct comparison showed that there is no measurement bias between the acquisition methods, whereas the mean absolute difference, important for both visual and computer-aided signal analysis, was equal to 1. 2 bpm. Such low differences do not affect the visual assessment of the FHR signal. However, in the indirect comparison the inconsistencies of several percent were noted. This mainly affects the acceleration (7. 8 %) and particularly deceleration (54 %) patterns. In the signals acquired using the electrocardiography the obtained STV and LTV indices have shown significant overestimation by 10 and 50 % respectively. It also turned out, that ability of clinical parameters to distinguish between normal and abnormal groups do not depend on the acquisition method. The obtained results prove that the abdominal FECG, considered {{as an alternative to the}} ultrasound approach, does not change the interpretation of the FHR signal, which was confirmed during both visual assessment and automated analysis.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate retention procedures and protocols which are used by the orthodontists in Lithuania and to identify commonly used types of dental retainers. Methods One hundred seven questionnaires in total with 28 multiple-choice questions were sent to all members of the Lithuanian Orthodontic Society. The questionnaire was organized into eight sections representing specific information about socio-demographic status of the respondents, selection of a retention system, details of commonly used fixed and removable retainers, the duration of the retention period, supervision of the retainers, instructions for patients, and necessity of common retention guidelines. Results The overall response rate was 75. 7 %. All of the respondents prescribed retainers after the orthodontic therapy. More than 40 % of the respondents combined fixed and removable retainers in different clinical situations, but the first-choice option after an expansion of the maxillary dental arch was the removable retainer (54. 3 %); meanwhile, a fixed retainer was used after a correction of any rotations of the mandibular anterior teeth (49. 4 %). The Hawley retainer was preferred by 90. 1 % of the respondents for a maxillary dental arch, and 74. 1 % of them preferred it for a mandibular dental arch.
