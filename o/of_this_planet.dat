5|$|WASP-15b is an {{extrasolar planet}} {{discovered}} in 2008 by the SuperWASP collaboration, {{which seeks to}} discover exoplanets that transit their host stars. The planet orbits its host star {{at a distance of}} 0.05 AU every four days. The mass <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>planet</b> is about one half that of Jupiter, but its radius is nearly 50% larger than Jupiter's, making the density <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>planet</b> only one quarter that of water; it is thought that some other form of heating must explain its extremely low density. WASP-15b's discovery was published on April 29, 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 it was {{hypothesized}} that these clumps could be caused by a roughly Neptune-mass planet having migrated from 40 to 65AU over 56millionyears, an orbit large enough to allow the formation of smaller rocky planets closer to Vega. The migration <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>planet</b> would likely require gravitational interaction with a second, higher-mass planet in a smaller orbit.|$|E
5|$|The {{parameters}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>planet</b> {{was initially}} very weakly constrained, with {{a period in}} excess of 8 years with a high eccentricity and a minimum mass of approximately two times the mass of Jupiter.

5|$|Ecologists {{study and}} measure {{nutrient}} budgets {{to understand how}} these materials are regulated, flow, and recycled through the environment. This research {{has led to an}} understanding that there is global feedback between ecosystems and the physical parameters <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>planet,</b> including minerals, soil, pH, ions, water, and atmospheric gases. Six major elements (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus; H, C, N, O, S, and P) form the constitution of all biological macromolecules and feed into the Earth's geochemical processes. From the smallest scale of biology, the combined effect of billions upon billions of ecological processes amplify and ultimately regulate the biogeochemical cycles of the Earth. Understanding the relations and cycles mediated between these elements and their ecological pathways has significant bearing toward understanding global biogeochemistry.|$|E
5|$|The Earth {{formed from}} the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun, but the planets {{acquired}} different compositions during the formation and evolution of the solar system. In turn, {{the natural history of}} the Earth caused parts <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>planet</b> to have differing concentrations of the elements. The mass of the Earth is approximately 5.98kg. It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to planetary differentiation, the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.|$|E

25|$|Maya astronomical codices include {{detailed}} {{tables for}} calculating {{phases of the}} Moon, the recurrence of eclipses, and the appearance and disappearance of Venus as morning and evening star. The Maya based their calendrics in the carefully calculated cycles of the Pleiades, the Sun, the Moon, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, and also they had a precise description of the eclipses as depicted in the Dresden Codex, {{as well as the}} ecliptic or zodiac, and the Milky Way was crucial in their Cosmology. A number of important Maya structures are believed to have been oriented toward the extreme risings and settings of Venus.

500|$|... 55 Cancri e was {{announced}} in 2004. With 8.3 Earth masses, it is a large super-Earth which was originally thought to have an orbital period of 2.8 days, though it was later found {{that this was an}} alias of its true period of 0.74 days by observations of e transiting in 2011. This planet was the first instance of a fourth extrasolar planet in one system, and was the shortest-period planet until the discovery of PSR J1719-1438 b. The measurements that led to the discovery <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>planet</b> also confirmed the existence of 55 Cancri c.|$|E
500|$|When 55 Cancri d was discovered, it {{was thought}} to be on a fairly low {{eccentricity}} orbit similar to Jupiter in the Solar System, though the orbital elements were not well determined.

500|$|The true mass <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>planet</b> remains unknown, {{but it can}} be {{estimated}} based on the displacement effect of the planet's gravity on Epsilon Eridani. Only the component of the displacement along the line of sight to Earth is known, which yields a value for the formula msini, where m is the mass of the planet and i is the orbital inclination. Estimates for the value of [...] range from 0.60 Jupiter masses to 1.06 Jupiter masses, which sets the lower limit for the mass of the planet (because the sine function has a maximum value of 1). By choosing a mass of 0.78 and an estimated inclination of 30°, this yields the frequently cited value of [...] Jupiter masses for the planet's mass.|$|E

500|$|In 2008 Tadashi Mukai and Patryk Sofia Lykawka {{suggested}} that a distant Mars- or Earth-sized minor planet currently in a highly eccentric orbit between 100 and [...] and orbital period of 1000 years with an inclination of 20° to 40° {{was responsible for the}} structure of the Kuiper belt. They proposed that the perturbations <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>planet</b> excited the eccentricities and inclinations of the trans-Neptunian objects, truncated the planetesimal disk at 48 AU, and detached the orbits of objects like Sedna from Neptune. During Neptune's migration this planet is posited to have been captured in an outer resonance of Neptune and to have evolved into a higher perihelion orbit due to the Kozai mechanism leaving the remaining trans-Neptunian objects on stable orbits.|$|E
500|$|Kepler-11b is an {{exoplanet}} discovered {{around the}} star Kepler-11 by the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA-led mission to discover Earth-like planets. Kepler-11b {{is less than}} about three times as massive and {{twice as large as}} Earth, but it has a lower density (≤ 3 g/cm3), and is thus most likely not of Earth-like composition. Kepler-11b is the hottest of the six planets in the Kepler-11 system, and orbits more closely to Kepler-11 than the other planets in the system. Kepler-11b, along with its five counterparts, form the first discovered planetary system with more than three transiting planets—the most densely packed known planetary system. [...] The system is also the flattest known planetary system. The discovery <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>planet</b> and its five sister planets was announced on February 2, 2011, after follow-up investigations.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, an {{extrasolar planet}} was {{announced}} by the Anglo-Australian Planet Search team, together with the planet orbiting Epsilon Reticuli. The planet, designated Mu Arae b, {{was thought to be}} in a highly eccentric orbit of around 743 days. The discovery was made by analysing variations in the star's radial velocity (measured by observing the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines) as a result of being pulled around by the planet's gravity. [...] Further observations revealed the presence of a second object in the system (now designated as Mu Arae e), which was published in 2004. At the time, the parameters <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>planet</b> were poorly constrained and it was thought to be in an orbit of around 8.2 years with a high eccentricity.

500|$|Civil disobedience as non-violent protest {{or civil}} {{resistance}} are also acts of conscience, but are designed {{by those who}} undertake them chiefly to change, by appealing to the majority and democratic processes, laws or government policies perceived to be incoherent with fundamental social virtues and principles (such as justice, equality or respect for intrinsic human dignity). Civil disobedience, in a properly functioning democracy, allows a minority who feel strongly that a law infringes their sense of justice (but have no capacity to obtain legislative amendments or {{a referendum on the}} issue) to make a potentially apathetic or uninformed majority take account of the intensity of opposing views. A notable example of civil resistance or satyagraha ("satya" [...] in sanskrit means [...] "truth and compassion", [...] "agraha" [...] means [...] "firmness of will") involved Mahatma Gandhi making salt in India when that act was prohibited by a British statute, in order to create moral pressure for law reform. Rosa Parks similarly acted on conscience in 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama refusing a legal order to give up her seat to make room for a white passenger; her action (and the similar earlier act of 15-year-old Claudette Colvin) leading to the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Rachel Corrie was a US citizen allegedly killed by a bulldozer operated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) while involved in direct action (based on the non-violent principles of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi) to prevent demolition of the home of local Palestinian pharmacist Samir Nasrallah. Al Gore has argued [...] "If you're a young person looking at the future <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>planet</b> and looking at what is being done right now, and not done, I believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration." [...] In 2011, NASA climate scientist James E. Hansen, environmental leader Phil Radford and Professor Bill McKibben were arrested for opposing a tar sands oil pipeline and Canadian renewable energy professor Mark Jaccard was arrested for opposing mountain-top coal mining; in his book Storms of my Grandchildren Hansen calls for similar civil resistance on a global scale to help replace the 'business-as-usual' Kyoto Protocol cap and trade system, with a progressive carbon tax at emission source on the oil, gas and coal industries – revenue being paid as dividends to low carbon footprint families.|$|E
500|$|Noam Chomsky {{has argued}} that forces {{opposing}} the development of such a world conscience include free market ideologies that valorise corporate greed in nominal electoral democracies where advertising, shopping malls and indebtedness, shape citizens into apathetic consumers in relation to information and access necessary for democratic participation. John Passmore {{has argued that}} mystical considerations about the global expansion of all human consciousness, should {{take into account that}} if as a species we do become something much superior to what we are now, it will be as a consequence of conscience not only implanting a goal of moral perfectibility, but assisting us to remain periodically anxious, passionate and discontented, for these are necessary components of care and compassion. The Committee on Conscience of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum has targeted genocides such as those in Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur, the Congo and Chechnya as challenges to the world's conscience. Oscar Arias Sanchez has criticised global arms industry spending as a failure of conscience by nation states: [...] "When a country decides to invest in arms, rather than in education, housing, the environment, and health services for its people, it is depriving a whole generation of its right to prosperity and happiness. We have produced one firearm for every ten inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>planet,</b> and yet we have not bothered to end hunger when such a feat is well within our reach. This is not a necessary or inevitable state of affairs. It is a deliberate choice" [...] (see Campaign Against Arms Trade). US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, after meeting with the 14th Dalai Lama during the 2008 violent protests in Tibet and aftermath said: [...] "The situation in Tibet is a challenge to the conscience of the world." [...] Nelson Mandela, through his example and words, has been described as having shaped the conscience of the world. [...] The Right Livelihood Award is awarded yearly in Sweden to those people, mostly strongly motivated by conscience, who have made exemplary practical contributions to resolving the great challenges facing our planet and its people. In 2009, for example, along with Catherine Hamlin (obstetric fistula and see fistula foundation)), David Suzuki (promoting awareness of climate change) and Alyn Ware (nuclear disarmament), René Ngongo shared the Right Livelihood Award [...] "for his courage in confronting the forces that are destroying the Congo Basin's rainforests and building political support for their conservation and sustainable use". Avaaz {{is one of the largest}} global on-line organizations launched in January 2007 to promote conscience-driven activism on issues such as climate change, human rights, animal rights, corruption, poverty, and conflict, thus [...] "closing the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want".|$|E
