We employ the flexible fixed cost quadratic function which relates total university R&D expenditure and the budget of the technology transfer offices with different outputs of research and technology transfer, from which we then compute the ray economies <b>of</b> <b>scale,</b> the specific economies <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> and the economies of scope. Our results indicate that ray economies <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> and research specific economies <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> hold up to 100 % of current mean expenditure. The technology transfer product specific economies <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> hold up to 150 % of current mean of the R&D expenditure. Our results also show that cost subadditivity acts a positive constraint, from which we infer the presence of economies of scope.

40|$|This article aims at {{giving a}} {{contribution}} to the issue of the determinants <b>of</b> economies <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> in large businesses. After the economies <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> definition, the study identifies and analyzes the economies of cost that, according to most of the well-established literature, contribute jointly to originate the phenomenon at stake. Then the study analyzes the information collected through specially created questionnaires from a sample of businesses listed on regulated European markets. The aim of the questionnaires is to verify if such companies obtain economies <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> in their productive processes and, if so, to identify which of the cost economies previously analyzed are actually achieved. Finally, the article analyzes data and information obtained through the questionnaires and draws some conclusions. Specifically, the study tries to overcome a one-way and sole interpretation of the economies <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> phenomenon in favour of distinction in economies <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> II level (“in the strict sense”) and economies <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> I level (“generic”) ...|$|R

5|$|The holotype {{and only}} known specimen, {{which is in}} very poor condition, is {{preserved}} in the Museum d'Histoire Naturel de Neuchâtel as specimen MHNN 91.2426. It has five auricular lobules {{in front of the}} ears {{on each side of the}} head, 39 rows <b>of</b> <b>scales</b> around the midbody, keels on its dorsal scales, and the third supraocular scale in contact with the frontal scale, all characters which align it with Trachylepis rather than Mabuya. The other putative mainland South American Trachylepis, T.maculata, has five instead of three keels, 32 to 34 midbody scales, and separated parietal scales. T.tschudii agrees with the Noronha skink in size, coloration, numbers <b>of</b> <b>scales,</b> and discrete characters, such as having the supranasal, parietal, and prefrontal scales all in contact.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales are}} highly curved, which creates inter-scale reflection. This {{mechanism}} is unusual among Lepidoptera. The proximal {{part of each}} scale is almost flat; the scale then gradually curves up and then steeply bends down at the distal end, covering the proximal part of the next row <b>of</b> <b>scales.</b> Because of this shape, adjacent rows <b>of</b> <b>scales</b> have valley-like grooves between them. This allows light to strike one scale, reflect at a roughly 90° angle, strike the next scale, and be reflected away from the wing. Because the angle of each reflection is far from normal incidence, the interference effect favours reflection of different colours of light than are seen when light strikes {{near the top of}} the curved part of the scale.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, P. Mausfeld and D.

Based on differences in the number <b>of</b> <b>scales,</b> subdigital lamellae (lamellae on the lower sides of the digits), and keels (longitudinal ridges) on the dorsal scales (located on the upperparts), as well as the separation of the parietal scales (on the head behind the eyes) in maculata, they concluded that the two were not, after all, identical, and that Schmidt's name Mabuya atlantica should therefore be used. Mausfeld and Vrcibradic considered Mabouya punctatissima to represent a different species on the basis of morphological differences, but were unable to resolve the status of Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata.|$|E

5|$|Multi-scale {{camouflage}} {{is a type}} {{of military}} camouflage combining patterns at two or more scales, often (though not necessarily) with a digital camouflage pattern created with computer assistance. The function is to provide camouflage over a range of distances, or equivalently over a range <b>of</b> <b>scales</b> (scale-invariant camouflage), in the manner of fractals, so some approaches are called fractal camouflage. Not all multiscale patterns are composed of rectangular pixels, even if they were designed using a computer.
