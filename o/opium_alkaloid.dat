5000|$|Narceine is an <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloid</b> {{produced}} by the Papaver somniferum (opium poppy) plant. It is a bitter, crystalline compound with narcotic effects.

5000|$|Papaverine (Latin papaver, [...] "poppy") is an <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloid</b> {{antispasmodic}} drug, {{used primarily}} {{in the treatment of}} visceral spasm, vasospasm (especially those involving the intestines, heart, or brain), and occasionally in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. It is used in the treatment of acute mesenteric ischemia. While it is found in the opium poppy, papaverine differs in both structure and pharmacological action from the analgesic (morphine-related) opium alkaloids (opiates).|$|E
50|$|The {{oxycodone}} {{component in}} the combination is technically 14-hydroxy-7,8-dihydrocodein-6-one, a white odorless, crystalline powder which is synthesized from the <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloid</b> thebaine. Thebaine by itself has no therapeutic value. Oxycodone is metabolized into oxymorphone. Unlike morphine and like codeine, oxycodone has a good oral potency. Prior {{to the introduction of}} paracetamol, Percodan was the mainstay in post-operative oral pain treatment due to the potency and long half-life of oxycodone. It originally contained a small amount of caffeine.|$|E

50|$|Neemuch or Nimach {{is a town}} in the Malwa {{region of}} the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. The town shares its northeastern border with state of Rajasthan and is the {{administrative}} headquarters of Neemuch District. Formerly a large British cantonment of Gwalior princely state, in 1822 the town became {{the headquarters of the}} combined Rajputana-Malwa political agency and of the Malwa Agency in 1895. The British Cantonment was disbanded in 1932 after which it was maintained by a British Municipal Board. Neemuch was the birthplace of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in 1939 and is home to a large scale army recruitment centre for the organisation. The CRPF still maintains part of Neemuch's British Military Cantonment, which was {{the first of its kind}} in India. The bungalow area, native troops area, bazar area and fields and gardens were maintained initially by the municipal board and later by the Municipal Council. After independence Neemuch City and the Baghana area were included in the municipal area. Neemuch is known as India's Eye donation capital as it accounts for the highest per capita eye donation rate in the country'. Neemuch also has Asia’s biggest <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloid</b> processing plant which is a government-owned company named- Opium and Alkaloid Works. It is a road junction and distribution centre for agricultural products. Handloom weaving is the major industry here.|$|E

40|$|Buprenorphine (BUP) is a semisynthetic {{derivative}} of the <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloid</b> thebaine {{found in the}} poppy Papaver somniferum.

40|$|Cytotoxic free {{radicals}} and release of several neurotransmitters such as bradykinin {{contribute to the}} pathogenesis of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage. We have studied the efficacy of noscapine, an <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloid</b> and a bradykinin antagonist, in reducing post-hypoxic-ischemic damage in developing brain of 7 -d-old rat pups. Hypoxic-ischemic injury to the right cerebral hemisphere was produced by legation of the right common carotid artery followed by 3 h of hypoxia with 8 % oxygen. Thirty to 45 min before hypoxia the rat pups received noscapine (dose = 0. 5 - 2 mg/kg) or saline. Pups were scarified at 24 h post recovery {{for the assessment of}} cerebral damage by histological methods. Our results showed that noscapine was an effective agent in reducing the extent of brain injury after hypoxic-ischemic insult to neonatal rats. Therefore, it is concluded that noscapine may be a useful drug in the managements of patients after stroke...|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} rhesus monkeys to assess some behavioral effects of the <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloid,</b> thebaine, in relation to its dependence liability. The concurrent intramuscular administration of naloxone did not antagonize the rate-decreasing effects of thebaine on a fixed-ratio (FR) schedule of food-reinforced responding. Animals trained to self-administer codeine (0. 3 mg/kg/inj) on an FR 30 schedule did not self-administer thebaine (0. 003 - 1. 0 mg/kg/inj) at rates {{comparable to those of}} codeine. Rates were minimally above those of saline at 0. 3 mg/kg/inj. Monkeys given 23 hrs/day continuous access to 1. 0 mg/kg/inj thebaine did, however, self-administer the drug at rates significantly higher than those maintained by saline, but not as high as those supported by 2. 0 mg/kg/inj codeine. Two animals self-administering thebaine did not show any signs of withdrawal when injected with 0. 1 - 1. 0 mg/kg of naloxone or when saline was substituted for thebaine. A third monkey showed a severe reaction leading to death following an injection of 1. 0 mg/kg naloxone...|$|E
