It has been held for 2 months starting on March 30, until May 18, 2016. The study aims {{to determine the effect}} of goad (Peranakan Etawa) milkfeeding with mangosteen flour as feed additive on total microbial,pH and appearance. This study used 16 female goats Peranakan Etawa, with a Randomized Block Design(RBD) consisted of 4 groups and 4 replications, each treatment consisting of of A (0 % control, B (2. 5 % flour mangosteen rind), C (5 % of mangosteen peel flour), and treatment of D (7. 5 % of mangosteen peel flour). Data were analyzed using ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). Parameters measured were total microbes, pH and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>tests.</b> The conclusion of this study showed thatthere are significant differences (P> 0. 05) on pH and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>test,</b> but significantly (...|$|R

Decreasing concentrations of the extracted capsaicinoids are given to a panel of five trained tasters, until a majority (at least three) can no longer detect the heat in a dilution. The heat level is based on this dilution, rated in multiples of 100 SHU.|$|R

Dipping the fish in 10 % sodium chloride solution containing 6 % acetic acid before pickling, was found desirable for retaining the meaty texture of the product.
