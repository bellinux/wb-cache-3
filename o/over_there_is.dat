25|$|Wilson’s diary {{records that}} on 24 March he (5pm) telephoned Lloyd George {{to ask him}} to come to London, {{received}} a telephone call from Foch (“asking what I thought of situation & we are of one mind that someone must catch a hold or we shall be beaten. I said I would come over and see him”), then had a meeting with Lloyd George at Downing Street where they discussed “the entirely inadequate measures taken by Haig and Petain” before receiving an evening message from Haig asking him to come <b>over.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> no evidence to confirm Haig's later claim that, on returning from a midnight meeting with Petain at 3am on 25 March, he telegraphed to Wilson and Milner to come over to France and ensure the appointment of “Foch or some other determined general who would fight” as Allied Generalissimo. Wilson reached GHQ at Montreuil at 11.30am on 25 March, having left London by special train at 6.50am then crossed to France on a destroyer. He chided Haig for having, together with Petain, blocked the plan for an Allied reserve, although in fact Petain sent a dozen divisions and it is unclear that a committee would actually have acted any faster. Travers argued that the true reason for Wilson’s visit to France was to discuss a retreat on the Channel Ports, but this view is not accepted by other scholars.|$|E

At Providence, the creek flowed directly southeast prior to the glacial period, reaching the Lackawanna River approximately [...] downstream of its current location. However, the course now flows to the east instead. The old course of the creek has been build <b>over.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> a ledge on the north bank of Leggetts Creek in its lower reaches.

500|$|CNN's Henry Hanks {{wrote the}} episode [...] "is {{reason enough to}} bring this series back for another season," [...] and praised Noble's {{performance}} as Emmy-worthy; Hanks also loved the [...] "genius" [...] musical score written by composers Michael Giacchino and Chris Tilton. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded the episode with an A-, explaining that, like the other reviewers, he loved the opening sequence with Peter on the lake, the newest mythology details, {{as well as how}} Walternate discovered the prime universe. Murray also loved the [...] "mood" [...] of the episode, but had minor problems with the plot, as he thought it was now harder to believe Olivia, Peter, and Walter were strangers {{to each other in the}} first season. James Poniewozik of Time magazine concluded that the episode [...] "was not the revelation that 'Peter' was, though a phase-shifting Olivia’s mistaking of Walternate for Walter was one of the series’ most mindblowing moments (and, again, a Lostian bit of disorienting sleight of hand). But it was again an effective detour in which Fringe reminded us that time has parallels just as space does, and that the past is emotionally overlaid on the present just as its <b>Over</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> overlaid on our world." ...|$|E
