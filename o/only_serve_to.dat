5|$|Long term {{proposals}} by {{the province}} call for Highway 404 {{to be extended}} to Highway12, between Sunderland and Beaverton. This extension would follow a new alignment to Port Bolster, east of which the freeway would incorporate the existing two lanes of Highway48. It has drawn criticism from various environmental groups who claim it will <b>only</b> <b>serve</b> <b>to</b> accelerate urban sprawl north of Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Cross Days follows Yuuki Ashikaga, a bespectacled young lad whose {{withdrawn}} {{school life}} goes awry when his affection for two girls begins to affect his relationships {{with his friends}} and peers. Though unaware of each other, the girls in question constitute {{the premise of the}} game: Kotonoha Katsura, a character well known throughout the franchise as the pivotal love-interest of Makoto Itou, and Roka Kitsuregawa, a newcomer whose efforts to make Yuuki jealous <b>only</b> <b>serve</b> <b>to</b> further complicate her relationship with him. Chie Ashikaga, the mildly abusive older sister of Yuuki, and Kyouichi Kasannoin, Nanami Kanroji's boyfriend, having only previously made cameo appearances in the School Days anime, return to make more prominent roles, as does Ai Yamagata, a character last seen from Summer Days. Rounding up the set of the cast are Ion Ishibashi and Kira Youka, a couple of friends who also make first appearances in the game.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Weylandt's death, Giro {{officials}} {{announced that they}} would not issue his dossard number 108 in future editions of the race. His number was a prominent part of signs held by fans on the roadside at not just the Giro but other events later in the season as well, including the Tour of California where his death was part of the reason the first stage of that race was canceled due to safety concerns. Many other races, mostly those held in Weylandt's native Belgium, also began the practice of not issuing the number. The Belgian federation criticized this gesture, saying it would not bring Weylandt back and would <b>only</b> <b>serve</b> <b>to</b> continually remind fans and those in the sport of Weylandt's death. They issued the number for the Belgian national road race championships.|$|E

5|$|Kirk {{moves out}} of the Van Houten house and manages to keep a cheery {{attitude}} until he is fired from {{his job at the}} cracker factory. Luann quickly readjusts to single life with Milhouse and starts a new relationship with an American Gladiator. While at Moe's, Kirk mentions that he never saw the divorce coming and regrets not being more sensitive to Luann's needs. Homer cheers Kirk up by telling him that his marriage to Marge is solid, but Homer soon begins to fear that his marriage may end in divorce. Homer enlists the aid of Lisa to help him figure out how to save his marriage, but Lisa tells Homer that he is lucky to have Marge. He recalls his wedding reception, which was nothing more than Homer and Marge eating a whale cake at a roadside truck stop. Homer tries to perform selfless gestures for Marge, but they <b>only</b> <b>serve</b> <b>to</b> annoy her.|$|E
5|$|In September 1854, the Anglo-French {{army that}} had been at Varna was ferried across the Black Sea and landed on the Crimean Peninsula. They then fought {{their way to the}} main Russian naval base on the peninsula, the city of Sevastopol, which they placed under siege. The Russian {{garrison}} eventually withdrew from the city in early September 1855, freeing the French and British fleets for other tasks. A discussion ensued over what target should be attacked next; the French and British high commands considered driving from the Crimea to Kherson and launching major campaigns in Bessarabia or the Caucasus. Instead, at the urging of French commanders, they settled on a smaller-scale operation to seize the Russian fort at Kinburn, which protected the mouth of the Dneiper. The British argued that to seize Kinburn without advancing to Nikolaev would <b>only</b> <b>serve</b> <b>to</b> warn the Russians of the threat to the port. Fox Maule-Ramsay, then the British Secretary of State for War, suggested that without a plan to exploit the capture of the fortress, the only purpose of the operation would be to give the fleets something to do.|$|E

25|$|The {{breakout}} {{was planned}} for 09:00 on Sunday, July 3.

25|$|First, the Legio Maria church {{recognises}} salvation through Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The discontinuity with orthodox {{theology is}} that the Son of God has been incarnated in multiple contexts, rejecting the orthodox doctrine of Christ taking a human body and soul for eternity. As {{we have seen in}} the above research, none of these incarnations are considered exclusive; they <b>only</b> <b>serve</b> <b>to</b> reveal Christ to people of different contexts. All who are saved through any of these incarnations of Christ will worship God together in heaven. Thus, for the Legio Church, salvation is found through Christ, as revealed in their particular Messias Simeo Ondeto.|$|E

25|$|We {{think of}} the {{proposed}} Harvard library transition {{as a manifestation of}} the University's accession to neoliberal imperatives. Occupy, whether at Harvard or Wall Street, challenges and refuses the devastating willingness of our broken society to view humans as expendable resources and systems as ultimately beholden to profit. A future cannot be imagined in the absence of its past, present, or future constituents. A library needs the workers who are its lifeblood, its circulatory system, just as a functioning democratic society needs the voices of the 99 percent. Systems built with profit imperatives can <b>only</b> <b>serve</b> <b>to</b> further perpetuate the patterns of destruction and unequal power structures that we denounce. The proposed library transition not only fails to address these systemic problems, it replicates them.|$|E
25|$|Cities, like municipalities, are {{composed}} of barangays, which can range from urban neighborhoods (such as Brgy. 9, Santa Angela in Laoag), to rural communities (such as Brgy. Iwahig in Puerto Princesa). Barangays are sometimes grouped into officially defined administrative (geographical) districts. Examples of such are the cities of Manila (16 districts), Davao (11 districts), Iloilo (seven districts), and Samal (three districts: Babak, Kaputian and Peñaplata). Some cities such as Caloocan, Manila and Pasay even have an intermediate level between the district and barangay levels, called a zone. However, geographic districts and zones are not political units; there are no elected city government officials in these city-specific administrative levels. Rather they <b>only</b> <b>serve</b> <b>to</b> make city planning, statistics-gathering other administrative tasks easier and more convenient.|$|E
25|$|Wearable Gold a.k.a. Object (2001) {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} inconspicuous black and white sling back shoes with 24K gold insoles, allowing the wearer to walk on gold without attracting too much attention, as well as providing security in less fortunate times. Noten got inspired when he met a stranger on a train, a Jewish man who spoke of the horrors of being in Auschwitz during the Second World War, and about money, poverty and death. The man explained that gold and diamonds were the only real currency and that he still carried gold inside his shoes for security against the next rainy day. Wearable Gold 2 are 24K gold glazed porcelain pendants that are much less inconspicuous and <b>only</b> <b>serve</b> <b>to</b> impress the onlooker as the real value in gold is limited.|$|E

25|$|The {{developers}} came to {{the conclusion}} that complex battles would <b>only</b> <b>serve</b> <b>to</b> confuse players. One play tester helped them by pointing out the quality of the fire pit puzzle, a puzzle that has the player-character riding on a moving platform that is descending into flames, requiring players to find a way to survive. He stated that it was both dramatic and exciting, but also a difficult puzzle. Wolpaw stated that this made no sense, commenting that it was one of the easiest puzzles in the game. He added that the battle was a dramatic high-point, since it was being the first time GLaDOS directly tries to kill the player-character and the first time that players have to use the environment to their advantage. After learning about what fellow Valve developers had planned for the final boss battle in Half-Life 2: Episode Two, the Portal developers decided to implement a neurotoxin that would kill the player-character in six minutes. This made it easier on the writers, who only had to write six minutes of dialogue. As a result, they scaled the game back, intending to ensure that everyone was able to see the game to the very end.|$|E
25|$|The early French {{withdrawal}} has {{led some}} to speculate that Kapisa will become a security vacuum just outside Kabul. This would be no small matter: the “ring of steel” that surrounds Afghanistan’s capital has been broken {{so many times that}} few have faith in the capital’s safety anymore. Several of those early attacks, before the influx of French troops, were planned and supported out of the Tagab Valley. The French presence there had reduced the ability of militants in Kapisa to launch attacks into Kabul. When the French leave, the U.S. would not have the troops to fill in the gap, leaving a big opportunity for militants north of Kabul to strike back.Most of the province population believe that the long-term presence of foreign forces in Afghanistan can <b>only</b> <b>serve</b> <b>to</b> perpetuate the war cycle and the departure of the French will weaken the Taliban stance. Over 60 French soldiers have been killed in Kapisa since 2008, with hundreds more injured severely. With the help of Afghan National Army, French forces conducted operations to repel the insurgents and Afghan forces were able to gain a foothold in Kapisa valleys. They oversaw the formation of the 3rd Brigade of the 201st Afghan corps that is now deployed in Kapisa and of the Afghan police who now are solely responsible for providing the province’s security.|$|E
