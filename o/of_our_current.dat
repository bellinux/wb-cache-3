It is filmed as a mixture of interviews with individuals, from Wright himself to Jane Goodall and Margaret Atwood, interspersed with striking footage from all over the world.

5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>current</b> technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E

25|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>current</b> {{knowledge}} was gained during the 20th century. With {{the help of}} the use of photography, fainter objects were observed. Our sun was found {{to be part of a}} galaxy made up of more than 1010 stars (10 billion stars). The existence of other galaxies, one of the matters of the great debate, was settled by Edwin Hubble, who identified the Andromeda nebula as a different galaxy, and many others at large distances and receding, moving away from our galaxy.|$|E
25|$|Hydro-electric, {{wind and}} solar power all derive their energy from the Sun. The Sun emits more energy in one second (3.827 × 1026 J) than is {{available}} {{in all of the}} fossil fuels present on earth (3.9 × 1022 J), and therefore has the potential to provide all <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>current</b> and future global energy requirements. Since the solar source for renewable energy is clean and free, African nations can protect their people, their environment, and their future economic development by using renewable energy sources to this end they have a number of possible options.|$|E

Nehemiah Grew, Marcello Malpighi, Robert Hooke, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, Wilhelm von Nageli were {{just some of}} the people who helped build knowledge on plant morphology at various levels of organisation. It was the taxonomical classification of Carl Linnaeus in the eighteenth century though, that generated a firm base for the knowledge to stand on and expand. The introduction of the concept of Darwinism in contemporary scientific discourse also had had an effect on the thinking on plant forms and their evolution.|$|E

25|$|Mars is {{fundamentally}} an igneous planet. Rocks {{on the surface}} and in the crust consist predominantly of minerals that crystallize from magma. Most <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>current</b> knowledge about the mineral composition of Mars comes from spectroscopic data from orbiting spacecraft, in situ analyses of rocks and soils from six landing sites, and study of the Martian meteorites. Spectrometers currently in orbit include THEMIS (Mars Odyssey), OMEGA (Mars Express), and CRISM (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter). The two Mars exploration rovers each carry an Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS), a thermal emission spectrometer (Mini-TES), and Mössbauer spectrometer to identify minerals on the surface.|$|E

The Deputy Master of the Mint who restored the design to the sovereign in 1871, Charles Fremantle, stated his view that [...] "it is hardly possible to over-rate the advantages accruing to a coinage from an artistic and well-executed design". By 1893, it was on all of Britain's gold coins; The Art Journal described Pistrucci's design as having [...] "triumphantly borne the test of time". Marsh noted, [...] "it is indeed a tribute that his wonderful design should still adorn the gold coinage <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>current</b> Queen Elizabeth II. It is one of the finest ever in our coinage history, and has certainly stood the test of time. Long may it continue." [...] Pistrucci's design has also appeared on a non-circulating £20 silver coin in 2013 and on the crown in 1818–1823, 1887–1900, 1902 and 1951.|$|E

2500|$|Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle {{called the}} film [...] "the most intense and {{original}} creature feature I've {{seen in my}} adult moviegoing life [...] a pure-blood, grade A, exhilarating monster movie." [...] He cites Matt Reeves' direction, the [...] "whip-smart, stylistically invisible" [...] script and the [...] "nearly subconscious evocation <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>current</b> paranoid, terror-phobic times" [...] as {{the keys to the}} film's success, saying that telling the story through the lens of one character's camera [...] "works fantastically well". Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter called it [...] "chillingly effective", generally praising the effects and the film's [...] "claustrophobic intensity". He said that though the characters [...] "aren't particularly interesting or developed", there was [...] "something refreshing about a monster movie that isn't filled with the usual suspects". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly said that the film was [...] "surreptitiously subversive, [...] stylistically clever little gem", and that while the characters were [...] "vapid, twenty-something nincompoops" [...] and the acting [...] "appropriately unmemorable", the decision to tell the story through amateur footage was [...] "brilliant". Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that the film is [...] "pretty scary at times" [...] and cites [...] "unmistakable evocations of 9/11".

2500|$|Ecopedagogy {{calls for}} the remaking of {{capitalist}} practices and seeks to re-engage democracy to include multispecies interests in the face <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>current</b> global ecological crisis. It does so by using different ideas that challenge {{the way we see}} education. [...] In Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy and Planetary Crisis: The Ecopedagogy Movement, Richard Kahn (2010) reformulates Herbert Marcuse’s critical theories of society, and supports the kind of education that seizes the power of radical environmental activists and supports the earth democracy in which multispecies interests are represented. The destruction of habitats and threats to biodiversity resulting from expansion of human population and consumption is rarely addressed in a way that confronts students with the necessity to consider moral implications of such destruction. Pedagogically, a return to education associated with significant life experiences, such as hiking in wilderness areas as a youth; as well as strategically significant education, action competence, social learning, and variations and combinations of those and many other pedagogical approaches developed in the past 40 years. Some of these pedagogical approaches have been disputed—for example, the belief that experiencing environment first hand is an essential component of engaging people in conservation has been disputed by arguments that these education efforts have been informed by behaviorist socio-psychology models that assumed a linear causality between education experience and pro-environmental behavior. [...] Rather, the critics have argued that people’s environmental behaviors are too complex and contextually dependent to be captured by a simple casual model. The process of environmental education of schoolchildren has the following methodological characteristics: ...|$|E
