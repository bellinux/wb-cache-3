5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating vomiting in children. <b>Ondansetron</b> has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of <b>ondansetron</b> might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of <b>ondansetron</b> may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ondansetron,</b> a 5HT3 antagonist, {{appears to}} have promise as a treatment.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is usually}} an acute and {{self-limiting}} disease {{that does not}} require medication. The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or <b>ondansetron,</b> may be helpful, and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.|$|E
5|$|Serotonin {{syndrome}} is typically {{caused by the}} use of two or more serotonergic medications or drugs. This may include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), amphetamines, pethidine (meperidine), tramadol, dextromethorphan, buspirone, L-tryptophan, 5-HTP, St. John's wort, triptans, ecstasy (MDMA), metoclopramide, <b>ondansetron,</b> or cocaine. It occurs in about 15% of SSRI overdoses. It is a predictable consequence of excess serotonin on the central nervous system (CNS). Onset of symptoms is typically within a day of the extra serotonin.|$|E
25|$|Dexamethasone and <b>ondansetron</b> {{are more}} {{effective}} than <b>ondansetron</b> alone in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|Nausea and vomiting: {{cisplatin}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} emetogenic chemotherapy agents, but this symptom is managed with prophylactic antiemetics (<b>ondansetron,</b> granisetron, etc.) in combination with corticosteroids. Aprepitant combined with <b>ondansetron</b> and dexamethasone has been shown to be better for highly emetogenic chemotherapy than just <b>ondansetron</b> and dexamethasone.|$|E
25|$|No {{specific}} treatment {{is available for}} <b>ondansetron</b> overdose; patients are managed with supportive measures. An antidote to <b>ondansetron</b> is not known.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ondansetron</b> is in {{pregnancy}} category B in the US. It {{is not known}} if <b>ondansetron</b> is excreted in breast milk.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ondansetron</b> was {{the first}} 5-HT3 antagonist, {{developed}} by Glaxo around 1984. Its efficacy was first established in 1987, in animal models, and it was extensively studied over the following years. <b>Ondansetron</b> {{was approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1991, and has since become available in several other countries, including the UK, Ireland, Australia, Canada, France and Brazil. As of 2008, <b>ondansetron</b> and granisetron are the only 5-HT3 antagonists available as a generic drug in the United States. <b>Ondansetron</b> may be given several times daily, depending on the severity of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Two small, {{placebo-controlled}} {{trials have}} been conducted to assess the efficacy of <b>ondansetron</b> for postanesthetic shivering, a common occurrence after surgery. <b>Ondansetron</b> {{was found to be}} as effective as pethidine (meperidine, Demerol) when given as a single intravenous dose before anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|The maximum {{recommended}} dose {{for patients}} with severe liver function impairment is 8mg/day. In these patients, <b>ondansetron</b> is cleared from the body at half to one-third the rate as in healthy patients. The concentration of <b>ondansetron</b> in body tissues as opposed to plasma is also higher than in healthy patients.|$|E
25|$|Use of <b>ondansetron</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with prolongation of the QT interval, which can lead to the potentially fatal heart rhythm known as torsades de pointes. Although this may happen in any patient with any formulation, the risk is most salient with the injectable (intravenous) form of the drug, and increases with dose. The risk is also higher in patients taking other medicines that prolong the QT interval, as well as in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, and/or bradyarrhythmias. As such, single doses of injectable <b>ondansetron</b> should not exceed 16mg at one time. (Oral dosing recommendations remain intact, including the recommendation of a single 24-mg oral dose when indicated.) Electrolyte imbalances should be corrected before the use of injectable <b>ondansetron.</b> Patients are cautioned to seek immediate medical care if symptoms such as irregular heartbeat/palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting occur while taking <b>ondansetron.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Ondansetron</b> is {{a generic}} drug and is {{available}} in many countries under many brand names.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ondansetron</b> is one {{of several}} {{antiemetic}} agents used during the vomiting phase of cyclic vomiting syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, <b>ondansetron</b> was {{the subject}} of a {{meta-analysis}} case study published in the British Medical Journal. Researchers examined 84 trials, with 11,980 patients receiving <b>ondansetron,</b> published between 1991 and September 1996. Intravenous <b>ondansetron</b> 4mg versus placebo was investigated in 16 reports and three further reports which had been duplicated a total of six times. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent vomiting within 24 hours was 9.5, with 95% confidence interval 6.9 to 15, in the 16 nonduplicated reports. In the three duplicated reports, the NNT was significantly lower at 3.9 (3.3 to 4.8). When all 25 reports were combined, the apparent NNT improved to 4.9 (4.4 to 5.6). Inclusion of duplicate reports led to a 23% overestimation of ondansetron's antiemetic efficacy.|$|E
25|$|A 2006 double-blind, {{randomized}} controlled trial indicated <b>ondansetron</b> may have {{value in the}} treatment of schizophrenia, as an adjunct to haloperidol. The study found the combination to significantly improve negative schizophrenia symptoms, and people taking both drugs experienced fewer of the adverse effects commonly associated with haloperidol. An earlier, smaller, open-label trial had found <b>ondansetron</b> to be useful in treating antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia, and the study patients also showed significant improvement in the disease's symptoms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ondansetron</b> {{has rarely}} been studied in {{patients}} under 4 years of age. As such, little data are available to guide dosage recommendations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ondansetron</b> is used off-label {{to treat}} morning {{sickness}} and hyperemesis gravidarum of pregnancy. It is typically used after trials of other drugs have failed.|$|E
25|$|Although an {{effective}} antiemetic agent, {{the high cost}} of brand-name <b>ondansetron</b> initially limited its use to controlling postoperative nausea and vomiting and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{reproduction}} {{studies have}} not shown evidence of {{harm to the}} baby or impairment of fertility with use of high daily doses of <b>ondansetron.</b> A study of over 600,000 pregnancies in Denmark found that <b>ondansetron</b> during pregnancy {{was not associated with}} a significantly increased risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, major birth defect, preterm birth, low birth weight, or small for gestational age. Other studies concluded that there is an increase in major congenital malformations due to an increase in heart problems among the babies.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} including <b>ondansetron</b> {{appear to be}} effective in controlling postoperative nausea and vomiting. It is more effective than metoclopramide, and less sedating than cyclizine or droperidol.|$|E
25|$|Trials in {{emergency}} department settings {{support the use}} of <b>ondansetron</b> to reduce vomiting associated with gastroenteritis and dehydration. A retrospective review found it was used commonly for this purpose, being administered in over 58% of cases. Its use reduced hospital admissions, but was also associated with higher rates of return visits to the emergency department. Furthermore, patients who had initially received <b>ondansetron</b> {{were more likely to be}} admitted on the return visit than patients who had not received the drug. However, this effect may simply be due to the agent being used more frequently in patients who present with more severe illness. Its use was not found to mask serious diagnoses.|$|E
25|$|Current {{evidence}} suggests that 5-HT3 antagonists are ineffective in controlling motion sickness. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of <b>ondansetron</b> to treat motion sickness in air ambulance personnel showed subjective improvement, {{but it was not}} statistically significant.|$|E
25|$|The first-generation 5-HT3 {{receptor}} antagonist (<b>ondansetron,</b> dolasetron, granisetron, and tropisetron) {{have been}} the most important drugs in antiemetic therapy for emetogenic chemotherapy. They are especially effective in treating acute emesis, occurring in the first 24 hours following chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} including granisetron {{appear to be}} effective in controlling post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV). It is unclear if it is more or less effective than other agents such as droperidol, metoclopramide, <b>ondansetron</b> or cyclizine.|$|E
25|$|Early {{studies have}} also {{examined}} <b>ondansetron</b> as a possible treatment for psychosis resulting from advanced Parkinson's disease. Its apparent benefits {{despite a lack of}} any significant antagonistic properties at dopamine receptors or the 5-HT2A receptor raises interesting questions about the etiology of psychosis.|$|E
25|$|Some 5-HT3 antagonists, such as <b>ondansetron,</b> granisetron, and tropisetron, are {{important}} antiemetic agents. They {{are particularly important}} in treating the nausea and vomiting that occur during anticancer chemotherapy using cytotoxic drugs. Another application is {{in the treatment of}} postoperative nausea and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{necessary}} to adjust the dosage for elderly patients under 75 years of age. The use of <b>ondansetron</b> has not been studied in patients older than 75 years of age, and it is not known if dosage should be adjusted for these patients.|$|E
25|$|The study's {{patients}} {{also showed}} {{significant improvement in}} the disease's symptoms; a later double-blind, randomized controlled trial also found <b>ondansetron</b> to significantly improve schizophrenia symptoms when used {{as an adjunct to}} haloperidol, and people taking both drugs experienced fewer of the adverse effects commonly associated with haloperidol.|$|E
25|$|It may be {{used for}} chemotherapy-induced nausea and {{vomiting}} and appears to work about the same as <b>ondansetron.</b> The most common side-effects of chemotherapy treatment are nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. This is one type of drug that a doctor can prescribe to prevent, lessen, or relieve discomfort.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{the authors}} found the covert {{duplication}} of reports on <b>ondansetron</b> {{was not easy to}} detect, because of lack of cross-referencing between papers, and reports containing duplicate findings were cited in eight reviews of the drug. Their analysis was a subject of an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1999.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ondansetron,</b> marketed {{under the}} brand name Zofran, is a {{medication}} used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery. It is also useful in gastroenteritis. It has little effect on vomiting caused by motion sickness. It can be given by mouth, or by injection into a muscle or into a vein.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ondansetron</b> {{was first}} used {{medically}} in 1990. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost of the injectable form in the developing world is about 0.10 to 0.76 USD per dose. In the United States it costs about 1.37 USD per tablet.|$|E
25|$|People {{with cancer}} {{undergoing}} chemotherapy are often given dexamethasone to counteract certain {{side effects of}} their antitumor treatments. Dexamethasone can increase the antiemetic effect of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as <b>ondansetron.</b> The exact mechanism of this interaction is not well-defined, {{but it has been}} theorized that this effect may be due to, among many other causes, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, anti-inflammatory effects, immunosuppressive effects, decreased release of endogenous opioids, or a combination of the aforementioned.|$|E
25|$|Antagonism of the 5-HT3 receptor, {{an action}} {{mirtazapine}} shares with the approved antiemetic <b>ondansetron,</b> significantly improves pre-existing symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and {{irritable bowel syndrome}} in afflicted individuals. Mirtazapine {{may be used as}} an inexpensive antiemetic alternative to <b>ondansetron.</b> Blockade of the 5-HT3 receptors has also shown to improve anxiety and to be effective in the treatment of drug addiction in several studies. receptors | journal = Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 181–202 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2203069 | doi = 10.1016/0163-7258(90)90086-H }} In conjunction with substance abuse counseling, mirtazapine has been investigated for the purpose of reducing methamphetamine use in dependent individuals with success. In contrast to mirtazapine, the SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, and some TCAs increase the general activity of the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT3 receptors leading to a host of negative changes and side effects, the most prominent of which including anorexia, insomnia, sexual dysfunction (loss of libido and anorgasmia), nausea, and diarrhea, among others. As a result, it is often combined with these drugs to reduce their side-effect profile and to produce a stronger antidepressant effect.|$|E
25|$|Several {{practical}} {{factors are}} also worth mentioning. Most of these agents caused very severe nausea (termed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in the literature) which, while not directly causing patient deaths, was unbearable at higher doses. The {{development of new}} drugs to prevent nausea (the prototype of which was <b>ondansetron)</b> was of great practical use, as was the design of indwelling intravenous catheters (e.g. Hickman lines and PICC lines) which allowed safe administration of chemotherapy as well as supportive therapy.|$|E
