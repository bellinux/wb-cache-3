40|$|The National Weather Service (NWS) has a {{long history}} in {{forecasting}} seasonal run off volumes in the western United States where snow melt is the dominant component. The NWS (known as the Weather Bureau at the time) first <b>opened</b> the <b>Water</b> <b>Supply</b> Unit in Salt Lake City in 1947 to issue ten seasonal supply forecasts. Today, official forecasts are generated by six River Forecast Centers (RFCs) and coordinated with other agencies. NWS forecasts rely on two fundamental tools: Statistical <b>Water</b> <b>Supply</b> (SWS) and Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP). SWS employs multivariate regression equations based primarily on the observed snow pack to date as well as other predictors such as climate indices and antecedent conditions to predict the seasonal run off volumes. ESP, by contrast, uses the continuous hydrologic model at the RFCs together with some prediction of future weather and climate to generate a forecast seasonal streamflow volume. NWS hydrologic forecasters contribute their expertise to produce forecasts at least monthly between January and June across the western United States. Recent and ongoing advances in forecast technology include improvements to ESP that increasingly account for meteorological and climate forecasts and include measures of uncertainty. Comparisons are shown between the various ESP methods accounting for climate and weather forecasts. Ongoing development is taking place in product delivery as well. A new web presence is being developed to present a consolidated picture of all NWS <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> forecasts as well as allow forecast users access to information from each forecast tool.

The contents {{of this article is}} the development of a forecasting model for the management of large <b>open</b> <b>water</b> reservoirs with <b>supply</b> function. The model is based on a linear autoregressive model, which forecasts values of average monthly flow from a linear combination of previous values of average monthly flow, autoregressive coefficients and random numbers. The autoregressive coefficient was calculated from the Yule-Walker equations [2, 3]. The model was compiled for the forecasts in the range of 1 to 12 month with a backward correlation of 2 to 11 months. The data was freed of asymmetry {{with the help of the}} Box-Cox rule [1], the value r was found by optimization. In the next step, the data was transform to a standard normal distribution. Our data was with monthly step and forecasting was recurrent. We used a 90 -year long real flow series for to compile the model. The first 75 years were used for the calibration of the model (autoregressive coefficient), the last 15 years were used only for validation. The model outputs were compared with the real flow series. For comparison between real flow series (100 % successful of forecast) and forecasts, we used as values of forecast average, median, modus and miscellaneous quintiles. Results were statistically evaluated on a monthly level. The main criterion of success was the absolute error between real and forecasted flow. Results show that the longest backward correlation did not give the best results. On the other hand, the flow in months, which were forecasted recurrently, give a smaller error than flow forecasted from real flow. For each length of forecast, even for backward size of correlation, different values of quintiles were reached, for which forecasting values gave the smallest error, [4, 5]. Flows forecasted by the model give very fine results in drought periods. Higher errors were reached in months with higher average flows. This higher flow was caused by floods. The floods are predictable. Due to good results in drought, periods we can use the model managed large <b>open</b> <b>water</b> reservoirs with <b>supply</b> function...|$|R
