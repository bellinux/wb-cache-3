5|$|<b>OutRun</b> Online Arcade {{features}} four {{modes of}} play: <b>OutRun,</b> Time Attack, Continuous Race, and Heart Attack. In <b>OutRun</b> mode, the player drives through five of fifteen stages, selecting them en route. The Continuous mode {{is similar to}} <b>OutRun</b> mode, but instead the player must drive through all fifteen stages. As in previous games in the series, {{there is a time}} limit that is extended upon passing checkpoints. Time Attack mode has the player race a ghost car over a pre-selected set of stages while timed. Time checks are presented to the player at various points on each stage.|$|E
5|$|<b>OutRun</b> Online Arcade is {{a racing}} video {{game and the}} most recent release in the <b>OutRun</b> series. It was {{developed}} by Sumo Digital and published by Sega. The game was released on April 15, 2009 on Xbox Live Arcade. It was also released exclusively in Europe for the PlayStation 3 on April 16, 2009 via the PlayStation Network. Gameplay involves players racing their choice of Ferrari through a selection of fifteen stages in the shortest time possible.|$|E
5|$|Pursuit-deterrent {{signals are}} {{behavioral}} signals used by prey that convince predators {{not to pursue}} them. For example, gazelles stot, jumping high with stiff legs and an arched back. This is thought to signal to predators {{that they have a}} high level of fitness and can <b>outrun</b> the predator. As a result, predators may choose to pursue a different prey that is less likely to <b>outrun</b> them.|$|E

5|$|The Dornier Do 17, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Fliegender Bleistift ("flying pencil"), was a light bomber of Nazi Germany during World War II. It was produced by Claudius Dornier's company, Dornier Flugzeugwerke. The aircraft was designed as a Schnellbomber ("fast bomber"), a light bomber which, in theory, would be so fast that it could <b>outrun</b> defending fighter aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The E-1s {{came off}} the {{production}} line in February 1938, {{in time for a}} number of these aircraft to serve in the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War in March 1938. The RLM thought that because the E variant could <b>outrun</b> enemy fighters in Spain, {{there was no need to}} upgrade the defensive weaponry, which would prove to be a mistake in later years.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{rush hour}} traffic, {{thousands}} of residents in Oklahoma City attempted to <b>outrun</b> the storm by {{taking to the}} roads {{in an attempt to}} drive out of the tornado's projected path. By attempting to escape the storm by vehicle, in direct contrast to the recommended plan of action, residents put themselves at great risk from the storm; had the tornado maintained itself and passed over the congested freeways, more than 500 lives could have been lost.|$|E

5|$|At 11:45, Armide {{surrendered}} to Centaur, followed 15 minutes later by Minerve. Both ships had suffered heavy damage and {{casualties in the}} unequal engagement and could not hope to continue their resistance {{with the rest of}} the British squadron rapidly approaching. To the north, Infatigable had failed to <b>outrun</b> Mars and Captain Lukin forced the frigate to surrender after a brief cannonade. With three ships lost and the other three long disappeared to the south, Soleil determined to flee westwards, hoping the damage he had inflicted on Centaurs sails was sufficient to prevent her pursuit. However, Gloire had also been damaged and could not distance herself from the British flagship sufficiently before support arrived in the form of Mars. With his ship undamaged, Lukin was able to easily catch the fleeing frigate and opened fire at 14:30, combat continuing for half an hour before Soleil surrendered, his frigate badly damaged. To the south, Windsor Castle had proven far too slow to catch the smaller French ships, which had easily <b>outrun</b> the second rate and escaped.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kirk, {{played by}} John Belushi, orders {{the ship to}} <b>outrun</b> the strange craft. Unable to do so, he orders phasers and photon torpedoes to destroy the craft. Unfortunately, all of the ship's {{equipment}} fails for no reason and the Enterprises systems break down. Suddenly, Dr. Leonard McCoy, played by Dan Aykroyd, runs onto the bridge saying that the aliens are on the ship. He says they did not beam aboard, but merely walked {{out from behind the}} curtains.|$|E
5|$|Embuscade was {{the next}} to surrender, having been {{battered}} in the opening exchanges by Magnanime, and further damaged by long-range fire from Foudroyant during the pursuit. Overhauled by several larger British ships, Captain de la Ronciére surrendered at 11:30 rather than allow his ship to be destroyed. Magnanime, suffering the effects of her engagement with Hoche, took possession of Embuscade and continued to follow slowly behind {{the rest of the}} fleet, while Robust, which had suffered severely in her duel with Hoche, remained alongside her erstwhile opponent to take possession. The direction of the French squadron's flight, following the direction of the wind, took them across the path of the straggling British ships, beginning with the Foudroyant. Most of the frigates were able <b>outrun</b> this ponderous enemy, but Bellone was less fortunate and a speculative shot from the battleship detonated a case of grenades in one of her topmasts. This began a disastrous fire which was eventually brought under control, but at a significant cost in speed. She was soon closely attacked by Melampus and suffered further damage. Nearby, the struggling Coquille surrendered after being <b>outrun</b> by the approaching Canada; Warren ordered the slowly following Magnanime to take possession.|$|E

5|$|New {{gameplay}} features distinguish Shadow the Hedgehog {{from previous}} Sonic games. For example, Shadow can use guns to combat enemies, adding {{an element of}} third-person shooter gameplay. Parts of the scenery, such as traffic signs, {{can also be used}} as weapons. Another new feature is the ability to drive vehicles, such as motorcycles and alien aircraft. Although Shadow can <b>outrun</b> the game's vehicles, the latter have unique capabilities, such as crushing enemies and traversing otherwise impassible acid-covered areas.|$|E
5|$|Rapunzel and Flynn {{eventually}} {{arrive at}} the kingdom {{in time for the}} lantern ceremony. Soon afterwards, Flynn is ambushed and vengefully turned into the police by his former partners-in-crime the Stabbington Brothers, who he abandoned in an attempt to <b>outrun</b> the King's soldiers, and is sentenced to death. However, before the Brothers can harm Rapunzel, Gothel knocks them unconscious and takes a heartbroken Rapunzel back to the tower.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} final day was stopped and {{cancelled}} due to worsened weather, {{culminating in a}} high-speed fall on the <b>outrun</b> by Christof Duffner after he landed an unofficial, world record-equalling jump of 194m. Goldberger's efforts from earlier in the event were enough to earn him a silver medal behind eventual winner Noriaki Kasai, who became the first non-European Ski Flying World Champion. Goldberger was {{able to return to}} top-level competition within less than a year.|$|E

50|$|As can be seen, Clean <b>outruns</b> Haskell (GHC) {{on almost}} all test cases. Only parser combinators are faster in Haskell. Using GHC -O {{we get some}} optimisations, making pattern {{matching}} and higher order functions faster than in Clean as well. In most cases, however, Clean outperforms GHC -O or at least isn't slower.|$|R
5|$|The {{waters in}} which Kimberella dwelt were {{occasionally}} disturbed by sandy currents, caused when sediments were whipped up by storms or meltwater discharge, and washed over the creatures. In {{response to this}} stress, the organisms appear to have retracted their soft parts into their shells; apparently they could not move fast enough to <b>outrun</b> the currents. Some organisms survived the current, and attempted to burrow {{out of the sand}} that had been deposited above them; some unsuccessful attempts can be seen where juveniles were fossilised {{at the end of a}} burrow a few centimetres long.|$|E
5|$|Three first-half {{possessions}} deep in Detroit Lions territory led to zero Buccaneer points {{en route}} to another blowout loss. Lions receiver Jeff Chadwick took a 73-yard reception to the Buccaneers' 1-yard line when Rod Jones fell down while covering him. Jones also got beaten by Leonard Thompson on a jump ball in the end zone. Vito McKeever was <b>outrun</b> by Chadwick on the Lions' third score. James Wilder had 130 yards rushing and 71 yards receiving for the Buccaneers.|$|E
5|$|With western France in {{the hands}} of the Allies, in late September Middleton made a leisurely trip east across France to the Ardennes Mountains, {{stopping}} en route to visit battlefields where he had served with distinction in 1918 during the Great War. The Germans were now behind a line from west of Metz, France, through Luxembourg, and east of the Belgian cities of Bastogne, Liege and Antwerp. The Allies had <b>outrun</b> their supply lines and had to slow their advance to resupply.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{beg your}} pardon, sir, once more; but your zeal <b>outruns</b> my wishes. I {{have every reason}} to think the wound was accidental; {{certainly}} it was not premeditated.

5|$|As supercells and {{multi-cell}} thunderstorms dissipate {{due to a}} weak {{shear force}} or poor lifting mechanisms, (e.g. considerable terrain or lack of daytime heating) the gust front associated with them may <b>outrun</b> the squall line itself and the synoptic scale {{area of low pressure}} may then infill, leading to a weakening of the cold front; essentially, the thunderstorm has exhausted its updrafts, becoming purely a downdraft dominated system. The areas of dissipating squall line thunderstorms may be regions of low CAPE, low humidity, insufficient wind shear, or poor synoptic dynamics (e.g. an upper level low filling) leading to frontolysis.|$|E
5|$|At 05:00 {{the leading}} British ship, HMS Monarch, was within range {{and opened fire}} on the French squadron, which divided. One frigate went north and was intercepted by HMS Mars, while another, {{accompanied}} by the two corvettes, turned south and managed to <b>outrun</b> HMS Windsor Castle. The {{main body of the}} French force remained together and met the attack of Monarch and the British flagship HMS Centaur with their broadsides. Although outnumbered and outclassed by the British squadron the French ships fought hard, inflicting damage on the leading British ships and severely wounding Commodore Hood. Eventually the strength of the British squadron told, and despite a fierce resistance the French ships surrendered one by one, the British capturing four of the seven vessels in the squadron.|$|E
5|$|Blackwood rapidly gained on {{the ship}} {{of the line and}} by 00:30 the frigate was within range, pulling up under the stern of Guillaume Tell and {{beginning}} a steady fire to which Decrés could only respond with his stern-chasers, light cannon situated in the stern of the ship. Decrés recognised that if he stopped to engage Penelope then the rest of Berry's squadron, visible on the horizon to the south, would soon overwhelm him. He therefore continued sailing to the northeast, hoping his heavy ship of the line could <b>outrun</b> the light and speedy frigate. However, Penelope was too fast, and Blackwood handled his ship with considerable skill, managing to pass Decrés' stern repeatedly and pour several raking broadsides into the French ship.|$|E

After parachute descent, Braddock <b>outruns</b> Vietnamese Navy Patrol Boats with a Jet-Powered speedboat.|$|R
