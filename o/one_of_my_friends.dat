5|$|It is a {{collaboration}} with <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> {{from the international}} music industry, Eric Turner, a very talented guy from Sweden, and with the boys from Play & Win. It is very particular. I consider that I went through all stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, which makes me move in a club and {{makes me want to}} hear it on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E
500|$|Beckett {{has been}} linked to such celebrities as model/sportcaster Leeann Tweeden and country singer Danielle Peck. On October 18, 2007, Peck was invited by the Cleveland Indians to sing the National Anthem prior to Game 5 of the American League Championship Series between the Red Sox and Indians. Beckett was the {{starting}} pitcher in that game, and some Red Sox fans theorized that her invitation was an attempt by the Indians organization to distract Beckett. The Indians denied this claim. It did not seem to affect Beckett, as he beat the Indians with eight innings pitched, five hits, one walk, one earned run, and eleven strikeouts. In a postgame interview with Beckett, when asked if he was affected by Peck's presence, Beckett replied, [...] "I don't get paid to make those decisions. She's a friend of mine. It doesn't bother me at all. Thanks for flyin' <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> to the game so she could watch it for free." [...] On January 22, 2011, he married Holly Fisher, an aeronautics engineer and former high school classmate. Josh and Holly have three daughters, Ryann and Sage ...|$|E
2500|$|Presently {{the moon}} rose, dead ahead of me; and painted boldly across its face was {{the figure of}} an Indian. He wore this war-bonnet of the Sioux, at his {{shoulder}} was a rifle pointed at someone in the river-bottom 30 feet [...] below; in another second he would drop <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends.</b> I raised my old muzzle-loader and fired. The figure collapsed, tumbled down the bank and landed with a splash in the water. 'What is it?' called McCarthy, as he hurried back. 'It's {{over there in the}} water.' 'Hi!' he cried. 'Little Billy's killed an Indian all by himself!' So began my career as an Indian fighter.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend's</b> {{most obvious}} {{weaknesses}} {{that he was}} impatient with less alert intelligences than his own.|$|R
60|$|I nodded, {{unwilling to}} {{acknowledge}} my ignorance, though, in fact, I knew no more {{what he meant}} than did <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend</b> David's post-horses.|$|R
60|$|I {{returned}} to the inn at eight o'clock, purposely abstaining from waking Arthur, who was sleeping off the past night's excitement on <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend's</b> sofas. A suspicion had occurred to me, as soon as I was alone in my bedroom, which made me resolve that Holliday and the stranger whose life he had saved should not meet again, if I could prevent it.|$|R
2500|$|In 2008, {{speaking}} to Kerrang!, Max Cavalera remembered: [...] "This certainly {{got in touch}} with the dark side of Sepultura. [...] "Refuse/Resist" [...] is an anti-police song – a real piece of anarchy. You could call the album riot music. It was full of heavy shit and some of it was risky, but it was just where we were coming from at the time. [...] "Manifest" [...] is also very close to me. That's about a massacre of prisoners by police at a jail in São Paulo. One hundred and eleven prisoners were killed, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> was there and took pictures of it all, one of which we used in the artwork." ...|$|E
2500|$|Coltrane's {{spiritual journey}} was {{interwoven}} with his investigation of world music. He believed {{not only in}} a universal musical structure that transcended ethnic distinctions, but {{in being able to}} harness the mystical language of music itself. Coltrane's study of Indian music led him to believe that certain sounds and scales could [...] "produce specific emotional meanings." [...] According to Coltrane, the goal of a musician was to understand these forces, control them, and elicit a response from the audience. Coltrane said: [...] "I would like to bring to people something like happiness. I would like to discover a method so that if I want it to rain, it will start right away to rain. If <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> is ill, I'd like to play a certain song and he will be cured; when he'd be broke, I'd bring out a different song and immediately he'd receive all the money he needed." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Clutches!" [...] I {{hated the}} way we were talking. [...] "Thank you very much. You forget you are {{speaking}} of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends.</b> Besides, I can take care of myself." [...] He made no answer.|$|E

6000|$|... "And now, can I aid {{you in any}} way, Sahib? <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends,</b> a merchant, {{could get}} the horses for you without difficulty. He has often {{occasion}} to buy them, {{for the purposes of}} his trade." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, {{let us go}} to the House of Commons," [...] said <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends,</b> [...] "and make a {{night of}} it." [...] "With all my heart," [...] replied I, [...] "if I only had another body to go into to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{we have an}} hour to {{wait for}} the up train, and it's pleasanter waiting there than here," [...] replied Blunt; [...] "besides, I have {{business}} at Langrye; I want to see <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> there who is looking after light-fingered gentry." ...|$|E
60|$|She was in {{the same}} humour in the evening. I {{discovered}} in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend's</b> precious publications--the Life, Letters, and Labours of Miss Jane Ann Stamper, forty-fourth edition--passages which bore with a marvellous appropriateness on Rachel's present position. Upon my proposing to read them, she went to the piano. Conceive how little she must have known of serious people, if she supposed that my patience was to be exhausted in that way! I kept Miss Jane Ann Stamper by me, and waited for events with the most unfaltering trust in the future.|$|R
60|$|I {{was going}} on to tell him {{a lot more about}} Fred, who had always been <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> warmest <b>friends,</b> when he {{suddenly}} got hold of a stick and walloped me with it.|$|R

6000|$|... "Good idea!" [...] he exclaimed, {{responding}} to her humor. [...] "I'm pretty handy with the machine. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> up at Winona had one. I hope {{you own a}} car." [...] He said this with intent to indicate his growing desire to be near her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, dear, {{there is}} no cause for unrest. He is the only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> whom you have not known intimately. All those who are round me now, {{you know that you}} can trust and that you can love," [...] he added earnestly and significantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then until I {{hear what}} they are, you are on your defense," [...] said Eleanor, {{with a smile that}} set his blood tingling. [...] "In the meanwhile, I am far from pleased with you.

60|$|A year passed away, {{and at last}} I got {{a letter}} from <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends,</b> dated from the Arctic regions, near the mouth of Mackenzie River; the other wrote to me from among the snow-clad caps of the Rocky Mountains; while I {{addressed}} them from the swampy, ice-begirt shores of Hudson Bay.|$|E
60|$|On {{one side}} of the grounds was an old-fashioned cottage, which <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> {{informed}} me Mr. Sturge formerly kept fitted up as a water cure hospital, for those whose means did not allow them to go to larger establishments.

60|$|THE LADY. I am not. I couldn't {{bear to look}} at it. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dearest <b>friends</b> {{was blown}} to pieces by an {{aircraft}} gun; and since then I {{have never been able}} to think <b>of</b> <b>one</b> without horror.|$|R
