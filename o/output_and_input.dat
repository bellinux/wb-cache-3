2500|$|Multiple outputs - The professional-level modules {{from the}} leading {{manufacturers}} have multiple outputs {{to the sound}} board such that each percussion group (i.e. Toms, Cymbals, etc...) can be independently mixed (like the multiple miking of an acoustic kit). [...] Additionally, these groups have independent volume faders on the module to fine-tune volume settings for each group. Another commonly designated output is the MIDI connection, which sends signals to a computer based specialist MIDI software or, for example, a DAW (digital audio workstation). The increased processing power provided by this option allows the user to utilize actual, randomized samples of professionally recorded [...] or modeled drums. [...] The <b>output</b> <b>and</b> <b>input</b> of the pads, trigger devices etc. can be augmented or controlled through digital software, the module, MIDI instruments and other samplers. [...] The result is a phenomenally credible, nuanced, flexible set of instruments and, arguably, by some accounts; an almost indistinguishable augmentation or replacement for traditionally recorded drums and melodic/world percussion and effects. [...] Not many acoustic drummers will warm to that, and many studio engineers will quibble about the finer audio details regarding acoustic vs electronic, {{but that is not}} the scope of the article.|$|E
