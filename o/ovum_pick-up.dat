40|$|The {{potential}} of the <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> technique, used over a long period, was evaluated in 6 Italian Mediterranean buffalo cows that had more than 500 d open. The cows were submitted to <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> twice weekly for 2 mo. An additional 2 -mo cycle of <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> was performed in 3 of the buffalo. The <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> sampling {{did not affect the}} resumption of reproductive activity of these animals. In fact, all the buffalo conceived, on average, 47. 5 +/- 27. 5 d after the last <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up.</b> An average of 5. 48 follicles was punctured, and 2. 71 oocytes were collected per session. However, only 53. 5 % of these oocytes were suitable for in vitro embryo production. The number of punctured follicles differed between individual cows. There were no differences in the number of collected oocytes or in the recovery rates. The number of punctured follicles, the number of collected oocytes and the recovery rate were similar in the first and second months; the quality of the oocytes was, however, better in the second than in the first month (P < 0. 05). The increasing interval between 2 consecutive <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> sampling (intersession interval) caused an increase of the percentage of large follicles. Moreover, the increase of the intersession interval from 4 to 5 d decreased the quality of the collected oocytes (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Objective: The {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} which factors affect the cumulative live birth rate after elective single embryo transfer in women younger than 36 years. Additionally, {{number of children}} in women with more than one delivery per <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> after fresh elective single embryo transfer and subsequent frozen embryo transfers was assessed. Study design: Retrospective cohort study analysing data of a university hospital's infertility clinic in 2001 - 2010. A total of 739 IVF/ICSI cycles with elective single embryo transfer were included. Analyses were made per <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> including fresh and subsequent frozen embryo transfers. Factors affecting cumulative live birth rates were examined in uni- and multivariate analyses. A secondary endpoint was the number of children born after all treatments. Results: In the fresh cycles, the live birth rate was 29. 2 % and the cumulative live birth rate was 51. 3 %, with a twin rate of 3. 4 %. In the multivariate analysis, having two (odds ratio (OR) 1. 73; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 12 - 2. 67) or >= 3 top embryos (OR 2. 66; 95 % CI 1. 79 - 3. 95) was associated with higher odds for live birth after fresh and frozen embryo cycles. Age, body mass index, duration of infertility, diagnosis or total gonadotropin dose were not associated with the cumulative live birth rate. In cycles with one top embryo, the cumulative live birth rate was 40. 2 %, whereas it was 64. 1 % in those with at least three top embryos. Of women who had a live birth in the fresh cycle, 20. 4 % had more than one child after all frozen embryo transfers. Among women with three or more top embryos after <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up,</b> 16. 1 % gave birth to more than one child. Conclusion: The cumulative live birth rate in this age group varies from 40 % to 64 % and is dependent on the quality of embryos. Women with three or more top embryos have good chance of having more than one child per <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> without elevated risk of multiple pregnancies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to assess the}} {{feasibility}} of <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> and in vitro embryo production technology in field conditions in buffalo and crossbreed cattle. This study represents the first trial of in vitro fertilization carried out in North East Argentina. Buffalo (n= 11) and bovine (n= 3) donors underwent <b>Ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> twice per week for 2 weeks. The equipment was hand-made, resulting in the impossibility of controlling the aspiration pressure. A higher number of cumulus-oocyte-complexes were recovered in bovine vs buffalo (6. 3 vs 3. 6 per donor respectively). In bovine the quality of the COCs was also superior (53. 9 vs 26. 6 % of highest quality COCs in bovine and buffalo respectively). A significantly higher incidence of denuded oocytes was found in buffalo (38. 0 vs 11. 8 %), indicating a higher sensitivity of buffalo oocytes to mechanical damages. Despite the poor oocyte quality and the suboptimal culture conditions, the latter related to the lack of lab facilities, buffalo embryo cleaved (35. 7 %) and developed up to the tight-morula stage (22. 5 %).

40|$|We {{performed}} this retrospective {{case-control study}} analyzing 428 first-attempt {{in vitro fertilization}} (IVF) cycles, among which 254 involved women with a previous or present diagnosis of ovarian endometriosis. First, {{the results of these}} 254 cycles were compared with 174 cycles involving patients with proven non-endometriotic tubal infertility having similar age and body mass index. Women with ovarian endometriosis had a significantly higher cancellation rate, but similar pregnancy, implantation and delivery rates as patients with tubal infertility. Second, among the women with ovarian endometriosis, the women with a history of laparoscopic surgery for ovarian endometriomas prior to IVF and no visual endometriosis at <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> (n = 112) were compared with the nonoperated women and visual endometriomas at <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> (n = 142). Patients who underwent ovarian surgery before IVF had significantly shorter period, lower antral follicle count and required higher gonadotropin doses than patients with non-operated endometriomas. The two groups of women with a previous or present ovarian endometriosis did, however, have similar pregnancy, implantation and live birth rates. In conclusion, ovarian endometriosis does not reduce IVF outcome compared with tubal factor. Furthermore, laparoscopic removal of endometriomas does not improve IVF results, but may cause a decrease of ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropins...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine if}} immature bovine oocytes with cumulus cells at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage could be vitrified by aluminum sheets (AS; pieces of sheet-like aluminum foil). Cleavage rates in fertilized oocytes previously vitrified by the AS procedure were higher than those vitrified by a nylon-mesh holder (NM) procedure (89. 3 ± 2. 1 % vs. 65. 0 ± 3. 7 %). Cleaved embryos derived from the AS but not from the NM procedures developed to blastocysts. Furthermore, to investigate the effects of vitrifying GV oocytes on cytoplasmic structure and on the ability to undergo cytoplasmic changes, the intracellular phospholipid membrane (IM) was stained with the lipophilic fluorescent dye, 3, 3 '-dioctadecyloxa-carbocyanine perchlorate. After vitrification by AS, the IM remained intact relative to that of oocytes vitrified by NM. During in vitro maturation, reorganization of the IM was also undamaged in oocytes vitrified by AS before oocyte maturation, and the IM within oocytes vitrified by the NM procedure was evidently impaired. Finally, vitrification (AS) was used for GV oocytes collected using the <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> method. A bull calf was born after in vitro production and subsequent embryo transfer. The vitrification techniques described herein should facilitate generation of viable in vitro production bovine blastocysts using oocytes recovered using the <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> method...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the maternal influence on oo-cyte production and in vitro blastocyst formation rate using repeated <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> and in vitro fertilization. Six con-temporary cows raised on the same farm and with varied genetic origins were submitted to 42 weeks of <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> organized into four series. Collected oocytes were fertil-ized in vitro with spermatozoa from a different bull for each series. In total, 1933 oocytes were recovered from 3936 follicles with a recovery rate of 57. 2 % and a mean oocyte collection of 4. 6 ± 0. 2 (mean ± SEM) per animal per ses-sion. Animals were ranked according to their oocyte pro-duction. The best oocyte donor was the same female in all four series. No relationship was identified between oocyte production and blastocyst production rate (r =− 0. 08). The mean blastocyst rate was 28. 8 % with significant variation among animals. The best and the worst blastocyst producers were always the same animals independent of the semen used. The results of the present study support the hypothesis that in cattle, the oocyte donor influences the production of blastocysts. Furthermore, they demon-strate that oocyte and embryo production are independent factors.

40|$|STUDY QUESTION Does intrauterine {{application}} of diluted seminal plasma (SP) {{at the time}} of <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> improve the pregnancy rate by ≥ 14 % in IVF treatment? SUMMARY ANSWER Intrauterine instillation of diluted SP {{at the time of}} <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> is unlikely to increase the pregnancy rate by ≥ 14 % in IVF. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY SP modulates endometrial function, and sexual intercourse around the time of embryo transfer has been suggested to increase the likelihood of pregnancy. A previous randomized double-blind pilot study demonstrated a strong trend towards increased pregnancy rates following the intracervical {{application of}} undiluted SP. As this study was not conclusive and as the finding could have been confounded by sexual intercourse, the intrauterine application of diluted SP was investigated in the present trial. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION A single-centre, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, superiority trial on women undergoing IVF was conducted from April 2007 until February 2012 at the University Department of Gynaecological Endocrinology and Reproductive Medicine, Heidelberg, Germany. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS The study was powered to detect an 14 % increase in the clinical pregnancy rate and two sequential tests were planned using the Pocock spending function. At the first interim analysis, 279 women had been randomly assigned to intrauterine diluted SP (20 % SP in saline from the patients' partner) (n = 138) or placebo (n = 141) at the time of <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up.</b> MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE The clinical pregnancy rate per randomized patient was 37 / 138 (26. 8 %) in the SP group and 41 / 141 (29. 1 %) in the placebo group (difference: − 2. 3 %, 95 % confidence interval of the difference: − 12. 7 to + 8. 2 %; P = 0. 69). The live birth rate per randomized patient was 28 / 138 (20. 3 %) in the SP group and 33 / 141 (23. 4 %) in the placebo group (difference: − 3. 1 %, 95 % confidence interval of the difference: − 12. 7 to + 6. 6 %; P = 0. 56). It was decided to terminate the trial due to futility at the first interim analysis, at a conditional power of 62 %. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The confidence interval of the difference remains wide, thus clinically relevant differences cannot reliably be excluded based on this single study. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The results of this study cast doubt on the validity of the concept that SP increases endometrial receptivity and thus implantation in humans.

40|$|AbstractThe {{number of}} oocytes {{recovered}} from Bos taurus indicus females subjected to <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> averaged {{two to four}} times greater compared to Bos taurus taurus females. The objective {{of the present study}} was to test the hypothesis that this difference in oocyte yield was due to more preantral follicles in the ovaries of Bos indicus females. Ovaries (n = 64) from Nelore (Bos indicus) fetuses (n = 10), heifers (n = 12), and cows (n = 10), and Aberdeen Angus (Bos taurus) fetuses (n = 10), heifers (n = 12), and cows (n = 10) were cut longitudinally into halves, fixed, and processed for histological evaluation. The number of preantral follicles was estimated by counting them in each histological section, using the oocyte nucleus as a marker and employing a correction factor. The average number of preantral follicles in the ovaries of Bos indicus vs Bos taurus was (mean ± SD) 143, 929 ± 64, 028 vs 285, 155 ± 325, 195 for fetuses, 76, 851 ± 78, 605 vs 109, 673 ± 86, 078 for heifers, and 39, 438 ± 31, 017 vs 89, 577 ± 86, 315 for cows (P > 0. 05). The number of preantral follicles varied greatly among individual animals within the same category, as well as between breeds. In conclusion, we inferred that the higher oocyte yield from Bos indicus females was not due to a greater ovarian reserve of preantral follicles. Therefore, mechanisms controlling follicle development after the preantral stage likely accounted for differences between Bos indicus and Bos taurus females in number of oocytes retrieved at <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up...</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{presence}} of reciprocal and Robertsonian chromosomal rearrangement is often related to recurrent miscarriage. Using preimplantation genetic diagnosis, the abortion rate can be decreased. Cases treated at our center were reviewed. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis for either Robertsonian or reciprocal translocations {{was performed on}} all completed cycles of preimplantation genetic diagnosis at our center since the first reported case in 2004 {{until the end of}} 2010. Day 3 embryo biopsies were carried out, and the biopsied cell was checked by fluorescent in situ hybridization using relevant informative probes. Embryos with a normal or balanced translocation karyotype were transferred on Day 4. Results: Thirty-eight preimplantation genetic diagnosis cycles involving 17 couples were completed. A total of 450 (82. 6 %) of the total oocytes were MII oocytes, and 158 (60. 0 %) of the two-pronuclei embryos were biopsied. In 41. 4 % of the fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses, the results were either normal or balanced. Embryos were transferred back after 21 cycles. Three babies were born from Robertsonian translocation carriers and another two from reciprocal translocation carriers. The miscarriage rate was 0 %. Among the reciprocal translocation group, the live delivery rate was 8. 3 % per <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> cycle and 18. 2 % per embryo transfer cycle. Among the Robertsonian translocation group, the live delivery rate was 14. 3 % per <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> cycle and 20. 0 % per embryo transfer cycle. Conclusion: There is a trend whereby the outcome for Robertsonian translocation group carriers is better than that for reciprocal translocation group carriers. Aneuploidy screening may possibly be added in order to improve the outcome, especially for individuals with an advanced maternal age.

Heifers were given hay plus one of two dietary supplements for 42 days. The supplements were linseed (L, rich in linolenic acid, C 18 : 3 n- 3, n = 9) or soya bean (S, rich in linoleic acid, C 18 : 2 n- 6, n = 9). Oocytes were collected by <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> (OPU) for 6 wks (2 sessions/wk) and morphologic quality assessed. Half the oocytes were frozen and the other half was used to produce embryos. Blood samples were analyzed for: insulin, insulin-like growth factor- 1, glucose, non-esterified fatty acids, β-hydroxy butyrate and urea and the proportions of fatty acids. Neither growth rate nor plasma hormone and metabolite concentrations were affected by dietary supplement. However, L significantly increased the proportion of plasma C 18 : 3 n- 3 while S significantly increased the proportion of C 18 : 2 n- 6 (P < 0. 001). Neither oocyte characteristics (number, their quality and number fertilized and cleaved per heifer per session) nor embryo characteristics (number and quality per heifer per session) and embryo development stages were affected by dietary treatment. Real-time RT-PCR was performed on immature and mature cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC). Prostaglandin E synthase- 1 expression increased in L compared to S heifers. In conclusion, the type of fatty acid did not modify the numbers of oocytes and embryos produced by OPU-IVF and their quality in dairy heifers.

We report the efficiency of RSS on the pregnancy rate and birth rate of calves in a large-scale program using <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> and in vitro embryo production (IVEP) from Bos indicus, Bos indicus-taurus, and Bos taurus cattle. From 645 <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> procedures (Holstein, Gir, and Nelore), 9438 viable oocytes were recovered. A dose of frozen semen (Holstein, Nelore, Brahman, Gir, and Braford) was thawed, and the sperm were sex-sorted and cooled for use in IVF. Additionally, IVF with sperm from three Holstein bulls with freeze-thawed, sex-sorted (RSS) or sex-sorted, freeze-thawed (control) was tested. A total of 2729 embryos were produced, exhibiting a mean blastocyst rate of 29 %. Heifers and cows selected for adequate body condition, estrus, and health received 2404 embryos, and 60 days later, a 41 % average pregnancy rate was observed. A total of 966 calves were born, and 910 were of a predetermined sex, with an average of 94 % accuracy in determining the sex. Despite the lower blastocyst rate with freeze-thawed, sex-sorted semen compared with sex-sorted semen, (P 0. 05) and sex-sorted efficiency (bull I, 93 % vs. 98 %; II, 96 % vs. 94 %; and III, 96 % vs. 97 % for RSS and control, respectively; P > 0. 05) were similar {{for each of the three}} bulls regardless of the sperm type used in the IVF. The sexing of previously frozen semen, associated with IVEP, produces viable embryos with a pregnancy rate of up to 40 %, and calves of the desired sex are born even if the paternal bull has acquired some infertility, died, or is located a long distance from the sexing laboratory.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in the assisted reproduction in horses allow to breed foals from sub- and infertile mares, {{as well as from}} recently deceased mares or stallions. Oocytes can be obtained from live donor mares by <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> (OPU), by flushing oocytes from follicles using a transvaginal or transabdominal approach. Post mortem oocytes can be obtained by scraping the follicles. After oocyte maturation, the oocytes can be fertilized in vitro or can be transferred to the oviduct of an inseminated recipient mare (in vivo). Since conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF) is very unsuccessful in the horse, fertilization is performed by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). After ICSI, the fertilized oocytes can be transferred to the oviduct of a synchronized recipient mare or further cultured in vitro up to the blastocyst stage. Subsequently, obtained blastocyts can be transferred to the uterus of a recipient mare. In this article, in vitro embryo production in the horse is highlighted, and possible advantages and disadvantages and clinical and scientific applications are reviewed...|$|E

From January 1985 to December 1997, more than 3, 000 ovarian punctures were achieved at the CPMA of the University of Liege and more than 40, 000 oocytes were recovered. Global results show a take home baby rate of 23 % per <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> and 27 % per embryo transfer. Embryo cryopreservation offers an efficient {{solution to the problem of}} supernumerary embryos and opens the way for IVF-derived procedures such as oocyte or embryo donation, surrogate mother. The transfer of frozen-thawed embryos increases the total ongoing pregnancy rate per cycle of 31 %. One of the aims of our Centre in the near future is the development of new technologies such as control of chromosomal abnormalities or genetic defect in preimplantation embryos and clinical applications of oocyte or ovarian tissue freezing.

40|$|In India, a {{practice}} of "Batch in vitro fertilization (IVF) " has evolved in many infertility centers {{in an effort to}} align infertility management with logistics. A "Batch IVF" is an approach where the menstrual cycles of multiple women are programmed, such that they can undergo all the processes; from stimulation until embryo transfer about the same time. In "Batch IVF", the day for initiating stimulation is calculated retrospectively from the day the visiting embryologist is available at the clinic (day of <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up).</b> Aligning the cycles of multiple women with steroids followed by down regulation with long gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-A) is one of the currently employed methods for batching. There is sufficient evidence on scheduling cycles with steroids in GnRH-An protocol without compromising on the outcome. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide evidence-based clinical concept on scheduling cycles in "Batch IVF" setup with GnRH-An protocol through literature review...|$|E

40|$|In buffalo species the low {{efficiency}} of superovulation (SO) {{has led to}} an increased interest in the in vitro embryo production (IVEP) technologies for faster propagation of superior germplasm. The <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> technique, combined with the IVEP technology, has great potential to improve the genetic progress of this species through the maternal lineage. Although the IVEP efficiency has improved in the last several years, embryo yield and development to term are still very low.

40|$|From {{the end of}} 1996, two legally {{authorized}} centres realize {{in vitro}} production of bovine embryos in Wallonia. Ultrasound-guided <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> and in vitro fertilization (OPU-IVF) is mostly applied on cows from the Belgian Blue breed. During the first sixteen months of OPU-IVF activities (initial period), the production results in each center were lower than the ones obtained in other laboratories using that biotechnology, the average international production level being of 1. 30 embryos per session and per cow. Since embryos were concomitantly sold to breeders at an incentive price, {{this led to a}} financial deficit in each center {{at the end of the}} initial period. However, that negative situation should normally disappear within the two following years, owing to the expected improvement of the technical results. To conclude, the financial balance of each center will be attained provided that almost 10 cows may be punctured per week and also that from 0. 85 to 1. 25 embryos may be produced per session and per cow...|$|E
40|$|Background: Repeated {{failure of}} in vitro {{fertilization}} treatment is frustrating to the patients and their clinicians. Various treatment plans and a change of protocol have been suggested for “low responders”; however, patients who fail treatment repeatedly inspite of good quality embryos pose a special therapeutic challenge. Additional challenge would be imposed on that particular group when the local IVF regulating low does not permit surplus embryo freezing. Objective: To examine whether sequential transfer of embryos on day 3 and on day 5 after <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> improves IVF/ET success rates in patients with repeated consecutive IVF failures (⩾ 3 trials) compared to day 3 alone, with the background that local regulation prohibits embryo freezing. Study design: Randomized controlled study. Women scheduled for IVF/ET with repeated consecutive IVF failures (⩾ 3 trials) were randomized to either sequential transfer of embryos on day 3 and on day 5 after <b>ovum</b> <b>pick-up</b> (Group I =  74) or conventional day 3 transfer (Group II =  73) as a control. The primary outcome measures were clinical pregnancy rate and implantation rate. The secondary outcome measures were ongoing pregnancy rate and early pregnancy loss. Results: Baseline and cycle characteristics were comparable in both groups. Clinical pregnancy rate (per embryo transfer) was significantly higher in sequential ET group (37. 8 %) compared to that in day 3 group (21. 9 %) (P value < 0. 05). Also, implantation rate (per embryos transferred) was significantly higher in sequential ET group (17. 1 %) compared to that in control group (10. 5 %) (P value < 0. 01). Similarly, ongoing pregnancy (per embryo transfer) was significantly higher in sequential ET group (33. 8 %) compared to that in day 3 group (19. 2 %) (P value < 0. 05). Conclusions: Patients with repeated implantation failures, treatment with the sequential embryo transfer approach had significantly improved pregnancy outcomes compared to regular day 3 transfers. This approach would be particularly useful when neither oocyte freezing is a clinical option due to insufficient number of collected oocytes nor surplus embryo freezing is an option as the current local regulatory law prohibits it...|$|E
