40|$|Vitamin D {{deficiency}} {{is associated}} with several diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS). Several factors influence vitamin D levels and its optimal multi-function maintenance. Our objective was to assess quantifiable variables influencing vitamin D level and metabolism in MS patients from Kuwait. In a case-control study involving 50 MS patients, and 50 healthy control individuals for which plasma vitamin D levels, supplement use, vitamin D receptor (VDR) variants, and skin pigmentation indices were ascertained; we found <b>overall</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> levels to be deficient in both groups, and supplement use to be common practice. VDR variants TaqI and BsmI associated with MS risk, and ApaI associated with low disease progression. VDR variant FokI associated with higher vitamin D levels in both groups. We conclude that several quantifiable variables related to vitamin D associate with MS suggesting a possible clinical immuno-modulatory application of vitamin D for MS patients in Kuwait...|$|E
40|$|Objective/ Introduction: As it {{is widely}} known that low levels of vitamin D [25 (OH) D] are a risk factor {{in a number of}} {{communicable}} and non-communicable diseases, we wanted to evaluate its role in patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction and healthy controls. We also wanted to investigate the association of vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) genotypes with serum levels of 25 (OH) D in this cohort. Methods: We recruited 265 adult males (119 healthy individuals, 146 patients) with the age range of 19 - 64 years from the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases and personnel of the Aga Khan University. DNA was extracted from EDTA blood by salting out method. Gc genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP (Polymerase Chain Reaction- Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism). 25 (OH) D, alkaline phosphatase, calcium and phosphate levels were analyzed by biochemical kits.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is to determine 25 [OH]D serum levels in refugees in Italy. In the following research we have taken into consideration {{the results of the}} monitoring of Vitamin D levels in 46 refugees of the Italian Service for protection of refugees and asylum seekers (SPRAR) system. The indicator of <b>overall</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> status used was the circulating serum level of 25 (OH) D. Data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel. In the refugees tested, the mean level of 25 (OH) D resulted 9. 18 ng/mL. The standard deviation was 4. 8, with a minimal level of 4. 3 and a maximum of 27. 4. This figure indicates a clear condition of hypovitaminosis in refugees. While it is general assumption that migratory phenomena may induce the spread of tropical or infectious diseases, widely attested literature demonstrates how chronic pathologies and diseases related to altered lifestyles are the most relevant for Italian case records. Indeed, among the aforementioned diseases, Vitamin D deficiency so far lacks acknowledgement at a national level. Considering the results of lower-than-desirable vitamin D levels found in refugees in Italy, it is necessary to take this parameter into consideration when analyzing individuals who have faced migratory phenomena in order to mitigate the effects of hypovitaminosis D...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE), ANCA-assiociated vasculitides (AAV) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) are autoimmune systemic small and medium vessels vasculitides. In these diseases {{a shift from}} immune tolerance to autoimmunity has occurred. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>d,</b> an immunomodulatory secosteroid hormone, {{may play a role}} in this shift to autoimmune response. This review aims to study the relation of <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> level to SLE, AAV and SSc disease activity. Methods: Articles were located on pubmed using searches for <b>vitamin</b> <b>d,</b> SLE, AAV, SSc and associated terminology. Only for <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> and disease activity in SLE sufficient articles were found for a systematic review. For adequate structuring of this part of the review the PRISMA guidelines for reporting of systematic reviews were used. Results: <b>Vitamin</b> <b>d</b> has multiple immunomodulatory effects capable of positively influencing SLE, AAV and SSc. Monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, T-cells and B-cells are affected in such a way that infections and auto-immunity may be prevented. Based on current literature, multiple changes in the immune system of the illnesses occur that can be explained by <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> deficiency. Studies on <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> in SLE and SSc indicate that deficiency may be more prevalent than in healthy controls.

The present work is intended to examine prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among pregnant Saudi women and related risk factors. A cross-sectional study was carried out at King Fahad Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Serum 25 -hydroxy vitamin D (25 (OH) D) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 160 pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. Socio-demographic, lifestyle and maternal characteristics were collected and vitamin D intake was assessed using a 24 -h dietary recall. Weight and height were measured using standardized methods. Vitamin D deficiency (25 (OH) D < 50 nmol/L) and insufficiency (25 (OH) D = 50 – 74 nmol/L) were reported in 50 % and 43. 8 % of the study sample, respectively.

The Prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency among female adult students with associated biochemical markers was not measured {{in the state of}} Qatar previously. Aim. Measurement of vitamin D level and other clinical parameters related to vitamin D levels. Methods. Randomly selected 71 female students were recruited in Health Science Department of Qatar University for this study. Blood was drawn for measurement of vitamin D, calcium, albumin, alkaline phopsphatase and creatinine. Time of exposure to sun, duration, size of body exposed and dietary intake of vitamin D were quantified based on questioner. Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were measured. Results.

Despite these numerous potential health effects, data on vitamin D status at the population level and within key subgroups are limited. The aims of the present study were to examine patterns of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) levels worldwide and to assess differences by age, sex and region. In a systematic literature review using the Medline and EMBASE databases, we identified 195 studies conducted in forty-four countries involving more than 168000 participants. Mean population-level 25 (OH) D values varied considerably across the studies (range 4 · 9 - 136 · 2 nmol/l), with 37 · 3 % of the studies reporting mean values below 50 nmol/l. The highest 25 (OH) D values were observed in North America.

METHODS: An extensive and meticulous search was conducted for studies published in MEDLINE, EMBASE the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008 ” 2015), and the Science Citation Index published data from the Annals of Saudi Medicine and Saudi Medical Journal with the key words: Vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency, and Saudi Arabians. The inclusion criterion was studies published during 2008 to 2015, and studies involving healthy individuals between the age of 18 and 80 years. Binary random- effect model was used to estimate pooled Vitamin D deficiency. Prevalence rates along with overall estimate were presented by forest plot.

Summary odds ratios were calculated using a random-effects model meta-analysis. Results: Seven observational studies were eligible for the meta-analysis, including 2146 participants of whom 433 were diagnosed with GDM. Four studies reported {{a high incidence of}} vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women (> 50 %). <b>Overall</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> deficiency (serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 OHD) < 50 nmol/l) in pregnancy was significantly related to the incidence of GDM with an odds ratio of 1. 61 (95 % CI 1. 19 - 2. 17; p = 0. 002). Serum 25 OHD was significant lower in participants with GDM than in those with NGT (- 5. 33 nmol/l (95 % CI - 9. 73 to - 0. 93; p = 0. 018). Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicates a significant inverse relation of serum 25 OHD and the incidence of GDM.

However, such studies cannot determine the source of vitamin D. Therefore, we examined the association of dietary vitamin D intake with incident type 2 diabetes within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) -InterAct study in a heterogeneous European population including eight countries with large geographical variation. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Using a case-cohort design, 11 245 incident cases of type 2 diabetes and a representative subcohort (N = 15 798) were included in the analyses. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for type 2 diabetes were calculated using a Prentice-weighted Cox regression adjusted for potential confounders. Twenty-four-hour diet-recall data from a subsample (N = 2347) were used to calibrate habitual intake data derived from dietary questionnaires. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 10. 8 years. Dietary vitamin D intake was not significantly associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. HR and 95 % CIs for the highest compared to the lowest quintile of uncalibrated vitamin D intake was 1. 09 (0. 97 - 1. 22) (P-trend = 0. 17). No associations were observed in a sex-specific analysis.

40|$|At a {{time when}} nutrition-related diseases, caused mainly by excess, are on the {{increase}} in Ireland, it would seem {{reasonable to assume that}} the problem of nutritional deficiency should no longer be a serious public health issue. Yet, the recent re-emergence of rickets (a severe form of vitamin D deficiency causing deformity of the bones) amongst infants in Ireland, which was thought to be eradicated {{at the end of the}} last World War, clearly demonstrates that this is not the case. Vitamin D, which is involved in calcium metabolism and is necessary for good bone health, is primarily produced in the body via the action of sunlight on the skin. However, Ireland’s northerly latitude means that vitamin D production from sunlight is severely compromised and as vitamin D is found in only a limited number of foods, dietary intakes have little impact on <b>overall</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> status. Indeed, apart from the cases of rickets that have been reported, there is much evidence that sub-optimal levels of vitamin D in Ireland are widespread. Other countries at latitudes similar to that of Ireland, e. g.

It is a matter of some urgency that Ireland joins these other countries and has in place a policy on vitamin D supplementation that is safe, unambiguous and easily implemented.

The following factors affecting occurrence of vitamin D deficiency growth should be mentioned: improper lifestyle, using UV filters and inadequate vitamin D intake. The {{aim of the research}} was an attempt to evaluate action carried out as part of preschoolers' <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> deficiency prophylaxis taken by their parents. Material and the methods. The research was conducted in 2014. The group contained 118 parents of children aged 4 – 6. The method of the diagnostic survey was utilized in the research with poll used as a technique and author's survey questionnaire provided as a tool. The obtained results of the research underwent statistical analysis. In order to define the existence of the differences or correlations between analyzed immeasurable parameters, chi–square test was used. Results. Most of the interviewed parents supply their children with fish; 14. 4...|$|R
40|$|The vitamin D system {{comprises}} a {{group of}} metabolites, of which calcitriol or 1, 25 (OH) 2 D is the most active form, although its substrate calcidiol or 25 (OH) D is also able to activate the vitamin D receptor. In {{order to have a}} correct vitamin D supplementation policy, it is mandatory to understand the regulation and functionality of the vitamin D system, the definition of “normality” and the objectives to achieve. Although 25 (OH) D activity is lower than 1, 25 (OH) 2 D by a factor of 100, its serum concentration is 1000 -times higher, so 25 (OH) D is believed to substantially contribute to the <b>overall</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> effect on target organs. For several years we have been using a wrong threshold for 25 (OH) D “sufficiency” mainly in people older than 50 years. Nowadays, however, several studies indicate that the most adequate or sufficient 25 (OH) D levels in patients under risk of metabolic bone diseases should be 30 - 40 ng/mL. Thus, considering the factors involved in vitamin D metabolism, the population at risk of vitamin D deficiency is extraordinarily high and should be considered as a public health priority. In most European countries, fortification of dairy products is forbidden and in the USA the FDA (Foods and Drugs Administration) limited fortification exclusively to milk and cereals. Although food fortification has demonstrated being useful in the normalization of vitamin D levels, the issue on the adequate dose is still pending. To summarize, the best attitude regarding vitamin D supplementation is to admit that most patients under risk of metabolic bone disease would need 25 (OH) D supplementation. A dose of 800 - 1600 UI/day (with an adequate calcium intake), administered either daily or periodically would allow to achieve adequate levels in most patient...|$|E
40|$|Data on {{the effects}} of vitamin D supplementation on {{metabolic}} status of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are scarce. The current study was conducted to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on metabolic status of patients with PCOS. This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed on 70 vitamin D-deficient (serum concentrations< 20 [*]ng/ml) women with phenotype B-PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria aged 18 – 40 years old. Participants were randomly allocated into 2 groups to take either 50 [*] 000 [*]IU vitamin D (n= 35) or placebo (n= 35) every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Metabolic, endocrine, inflammation, and oxidative stress biomarkers were quantified {{at the beginning of the}} study and after 12 -week intervention. After the 12 -week intervention, compared to the placebo, vitamin D supplementation significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (− 3. 1 ± 7. 3 vs. + 0. 5 ± 6. 3 [*]mg/dl, p= 0. 02), insulin (− 1. 4 ± 3. 6 vs. + 2. 6 ± 7. 0 [*]μIU/ml, p= 0. 004), homeostasis model of assessment-estimated insulin resistance (− 0. 3 ± 0. 8 vs. + 0. 6 ± 1. 6, p= 0. 003), homeostasis model of assessment-estimated B cell function (− 4. 9 ± 13. 4 vs. + 9. 9 ± 26. 9, p= 0. 005), and increased quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (+ 0. 01 ± 0. 01 vs. − 0. 02 ± 0. 05, p= 0. 007). Supplementation with vitamin D also led to significant reductions in serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (− 0. 7 ± 1. 4 vs. + 0. 5 ± 2. 1 [*]μg/mL, p= 0. 009) and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (− 0. 1 ± 0. 5 vs. + 0. 9 ± 2. 1 [*]μmol/l, p= 0. 01) compared to the placebo. <b>Overall,</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> supplementation for 12 weeks in vitamin D-deficient women with phenotype B-PCOS had beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis parameters, hs-CRP, and MDA...|$|E
40|$|Seasonality {{is defined}} as a change in mood and {{behavior}} with the seasons. Research shows there is a possible connection between vitamin D levels and mood (Murphy & Wagner, 2008; Lansdowne & Provost, 1998). Given that vitamin D is produced when skin is exposed to sunlight and varies with sun exposure (Bertone-Johnson, 2009), the present study examined the relationships among vitamin D levels, season, and seasonality. Vitamin D levels were expected to be relatively 1) higher, but decreasing in fall; 2) lower, but stable in winter; and 3) higher, but increasing in spring. Further, it was hypothesized that these patterns would be stronger among participants with self-reported seasonality. College women (n= 187) ages 18 - 25 (26. 7 % White/Caucasian) were recruited either in fall (n= 82), winter (n= 34), or spring (n= 62) term. Participants’ vitamin D levels were measured from their blood samples collected at baseline (T 1) and again 5 weeks later (T 5). Participants reported their seasonality symptoms across their lifespan using the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ) at T 5, and were grouped into two categories based on their SPAQ scores: at least moderate seasonality (n= 88) and mild to no seasonality (n= 94). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to examine mean level and change in vitamin D (from T 1 to T 5) for individuals in the two seasonality groups, and whether any differences depended on season of recruitment. <b>Overall,</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> levels showed the expected patterns by season, but not by self-reported seasonality. That is, contrary to the hypothesis, individuals with at least moderate seasonality did not show significantly more pronounced seasonal changes in vitamin D in comparison to others. However, non-significant trends emerged, indicating the need to examine these relationships further. Future research will address study limitations by following a larger sample of participants throughout the entire year, assessing their vitamin D levels and current mood states at each season...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{connection}} between vitamin D-insufficiency, sarcopenia and frailty-syndrome has been examined. Vitamin D-insufficiency is common in germany regardless of age but has an even higher prevalence in the elderly. Sarcopenia describes the age-associated and functional relevant loss of muscle mass -following some definitions also muscle strength- whereas the frailty-syndrome is a multidimensional syndrome leading to negative outcomes such as heightened mortality. The hypothesis was that vitamin D-insufficiency favors the incidence of sarcopenia as well as frailty and that sarcopenia is {{a key factor in}} the development of the frailty-syndrome. Vice versa it could be imagined that frailty with limited mobility could lead to vitamin d-insuffiency due to reduced time spent outside and limited sun exposure. 360 community-dwelling participants of BASE-II aged 61 to 84 took part in the examinations. Serum level of <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> was determined via direct chemoluminescence immunoassay and muscle mass for diagnosing sarcopenia was measured using a DEXA-scan. Frailty was assessed with the frailty-index after Fried et al. and the five frailty criteria weight loss, exhaustion, physical activity, gait speed and weakness were determined via anamnesis, questionnaires, geriatric assessment and grip strength measurement. The expected high prevalence of vitamin d-insufficiency was confirmed in the BASE-II-sample (69, 7 %). The prevalence of sarcopenia (19, 5 % women, 15, 5 % men) lies in the middle compared to other studies whereas the prevalence of frailty (1, 1 %) was considerably lower compared to other studies presumably due to a lower mean age. The further analyses showed no correlation between vitamin d-level, sarcopenia and frailty. The variance of values of the skeletal mucle mass-index used for measuring sarcopenia could only very little be explained by age and physical activity as possible factors of influence. Furthermore the influence of skeletal muscle mass and age on frailty showed to be less than ten percent. These findings diminish the hope that a single factor like <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> will serve as a predictor for sarcopenia and frailty-syndrome which may offer options for prevention and treatment. Beyond that sarcopenia may not be the key factor in the pathogenesis of frailty as commonly considered. It can be assumed that sarcopenia and notably frailty are highly multifactorial conditioned and therefore the identification and emphasis of separate pathophysiological relevant factors may be a difficult task...|$|R
40|$|We {{undertook}} a prospective study in senile cataract patients using systemic aspirin and systemic vitamin E. Vitamin E treated eyes did show less progression of PSC opacities extent and less new nuclear opacities during the follow-up, but <b>overall</b> <b>vitamin</b> E treated eyes did {{no better than}} the control group eyes. More eyes in systemic aspirin treated group maintained the initial vision and loss of vision in the aspirin group was also less marked. Aspirin also caused a significant less mean increase in cortical opacity extent, nuclear/opacity and density and PSC opacity extent and density as well as in ophthalmoscopically graded opacity extent and density. We suggest that aspirin is a potential drug which should be further evaluated in large double blind photodocumentated studies. The present data does not justify the recommendation that aspirin be prescribed for slowing down cataract progression. This must await large studies and confirmation...|$|R
30|$|Long-term stable osseointegrated {{implants}} are {{the primary}} goal in dental implantology. Although dental implants have proven clinical reliable in the long term, the failure of implants {{at a very early}} stage of osseointegration has been described [1, 2]. The pursuit to identify the mechanisms leading to early implant failure is ongoing to date and include the following: tobacco usage, diabetes, wear particle release and foreign body reaction, local bone necrosis due to heat generation during bone preparation or implant placement [2 – 9]. Systematic reviews demonstrated that an antibiotic regimen before dental implant placement subtly reduces the early implant infection and consequently implant failure [10, 11]. In orthopedics, the risk to develop a periprosthetic joint infection has been associated with a low vitamin D level [12]. A relationship between bone metabolism, vitamin D, and early implant failure in human has not been proven to date. Vitamin D induces bone formation around implants in rodents [13 – 17]. Besides the classical function, findings of the last decades indicate vitamin D as an important immune regulator targeting both, the innate and adaptive immune response, since all cells of the immune system express <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> receptor (VDR) [18 – 20].|$|R
