5|$|Spotted eagle rays, {{in common}} with many other rays, often fall victim to sharks such as the tiger shark, the lemon shark, the bull shark, the silver tip shark, and the great hammerhead shark. A great hammerhead shark has been {{observed}} attacking a spotted eagle ray in open water by taking a large bite <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of its pectoral fins, thus incapacitating the ray. The shark then used its head to pin the ray {{to the bottom and}} pivoted to take the ray in its jaws, head first. Sharks have also been observed to follow female rays during the birthing season, and feed on the newborn pups.|$|E

5|$|Approximately one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> {{thousand}} children suffer {{some type}} of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E

Hayes's suggestions lead Scully to connect this murder to another killing two weeks earlier. In the meantime, Doggett wonders why anyone tipped him off about the murder, since it is not an X-File.|$|E
5|$|<b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> hundred peers summoned {{before the}} King in 1716, five lived in Great Marlborough Street. For a time, Thomas Onslow, 2nd Baron Onslow owned No.11 while Richard Lumley, 1st Earl of Scarbrough at No.12. For {{a time in}} the 18th century, the street was the main London {{residence}} of Lord Nelson. No.13 was formed of two separate houses, both leased by John Richmond in 1710 and subsequently joined as a single property. It was bought by Lord Charles Cavendish in 1740 and later occupied by his son, the scientist Henry Cavendish. Sir John Cust, 3rd Baronet lived at No.14 from 1754–62. The Byron family were listed as ratepayers of No.15 during the early 18th century. William Byron, 4th Baron Byron lived here from 1727 until his death in 1736; his widow remained there until 1740. The Baron's son, William Byron, 5th Baron Byron lived here from 1745–74. The Scottish sculptor Thomas Campbell worked here from 1833–1843, also taking over the neighbouring No.16. Sir Lambert Blackwell, 1st Baronet bought No.16 in September 1709 and stayed there until his death in 1727. His son, Sir Charles Blackwell, 2nd Baronet subsequently lived in the house until he died in 1741. Mary Lepell, maid of honour to Caroline, Princess of Wales (and future wife of John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey) lived in part of a house which is now part of No.34 from around 1716–1724. Sir John Cust, 3rd Baronet, Speaker of the House of Commons lives in No.41 (now No.46) from 1747–52. The first floor of the property was later occupied by the painter Benjamin Haydon from 1808–17; Gilbert Stuart Newton is believed to have taken over his lodgings.|$|E

25|$|In {{practical}} fibers, the cladding {{is usually}} {{coated with a}} tough resin coating and an additional buffer layer, which may be further surrounded by a jacket layer, usually plastic.

This reduces cross-talk between the fibers, or reduces flare in fiber bundle imaging applications.|$|E
