500|$|In 1959, O'Hara {{returned}} to film, starring {{as a secretary}} who is sent from London to Havana to investigate the activities of a British secret agent (Alec Guinness) in the commercially successful <b>Our</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> Havana. O'Hara beat Lauren Bacall to the role as she was busy with other engagements. Though the film was critically acclaimed, Crowther of The New York Times felt that the characters of O'Hara and the daughter {{could have been made}} [...] "more humorous and spirited than they are". The following year, O'Hara appeared in the CBS television film, Mrs. Miniver, but despite some critics approving her performance, most thought that the remake was ill-timed and that she could not top Greer Garson's performance in the 1942 Oscar-winning film.|$|E
500|$|Coward won new {{popularity}} in several notable films {{later in his}} career, such as Around the World in 80 Days (1956), <b>Our</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> Havana (1959), Bunny Lake Is Missing (1965), Boom! (1968) and The Italian Job (1969). Stage and film opportunities he turned down in the 1950s included an invitation to compose a musical version of Pygmalion (two years before My Fair Lady was written), and offers of {{the roles of the}} king in the original stage production of The King and I, and Colonel Nicholson in the film The Bridge on the River Kwai. Invited to play the title role in the 1962 film Dr. No, he replied, [...] "No, no, no, a thousand times, no." [...] In the same year, he turned down the role of Humbert Humbert in Lolita, saying, [...] "At my time of life the film story would be logical if the 12-year-old heroine was a sweet little old lady." ...|$|E
500|$|Coward's music, writings, {{characteristic}} {{voice and}} style {{have been widely}} parodied and imitated, for instance in Monty Python, Round the Horne and Privates on Parade. Coward has frequently been depicted as a character in plays, films, television and radio shows, for example, in the 1968 Julie Andrews film Star! (in which Coward was portrayed by his godson, Daniel Massey), the BBC sitcom Goodnight Sweetheart and a BBC Radio 4 series written by Marcy Kahan in which Coward was dramatised as a detective in Design For Murder (2000), A Bullet at Balmain's (2003) and Death at the Desert Inn (2005), and as a spy in Blithe Spy (2002) and <b>Our</b> <b>Man</b> <b>In</b> Jamaica (2007), with Malcolm Sinclair playing Coward in each. On stage, characters based on Coward have included Beverly Carlton in the 1939 Broadway play The Man Who Came to Dinner. A play about the friendship between Coward and Dietrich, called Lunch with Marlene, by Chris Burgess, ran at the New End Theatre in 2008. The second act presents a musical revue, including Coward songs such as [...] "Don't Let's Be Beastly to the Germans".|$|E

500|$|Richardson {{turned down}} the role of Estragon in Peter Hall's premiere of the English {{language}} version of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot in 1955 and later reproached himself for missing {{the chance to be}} in [...] "the greatest play of my generation". He had consulted Gielgud, who dismissed the piece as rubbish, and even after discussing the play with the author, Richardson could not understand the play or the character. Richardson's Timon of Athens in his 1956 return to the Old Vic was well received, as was his Broadway appearance in The Waltz of the Toreadors for which he was nominated for a Tony Award in 1957. [...] He concluded the 1950s with two contrasting West End successes, Robert Bolt's Flowering Cherry, and Graham Greene's The Complaisant Lover. The former, a sad piece about a failed and deluded insurance manager, ran for 435 performances in 1957–58; Richardson co-starred with three leading ladies in succession: Celia Johnson, Wendy Hiller and his wife. Greene's comedy was a surprise hit, running for 402 performances from June 1959. Throughout rehearsals the cast treated the love-triangle theme as one of despair, and were astonished to find themselves playing to continual laughter. During the run, Richardson worked by day on another Greene work, the film <b>Our</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> Havana. Alec Guinness, who played the main role, noted [...] "the object-lesson in upstaging in the last scene between Richardson and Noël Coward", faithfully captured by the director, Carol Reed.|$|E

2500|$|Rollins's {{contract}} with RCA lasted through 1964 {{and saw him}} remain {{one of the most}} adventurous musicians around. Each album he recorded differed radically from the previous one. [...] The 1962 disc What's New? explored Latin rhythms. [...] On the album <b>Our</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> Jazz, recorded live at The Village Gate, he explored avant-garde playing with a quartet that featured Cranshaw on bass, Billy Higgins on drums and Don Cherry on cornet. [...] He also played with a tenor saxophone hero, Coleman Hawkins, and free jazz pianist Paul Bley on Sonny Meets Hawk!, and he re-examined jazz standards and Great American Songbook melodies on Now's the Time and The Standard Sonny Rollins (which featured pianist Herbie Hancock).|$|E
2500|$|Other notable film {{roles of}} this period {{included}} The Swan (1956) with Grace Kelly, in her second-to-last film role; The Horse's Mouth (1958) in which Guinness played the part of drunken painter Gulley Jimson, as well as writing the screenplay, {{for which he was}} nominated for an Academy Award; the lead in Carol Reed's <b>Our</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> Havana (1959); Marcus Aurelius in The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964); The Quiller Memorandum (1966); Marley's Ghost in Scrooge (1970); Charles I in Cromwell (1970); Pope Innocent III in Franco Zeffirelli's Brother Sun, Sister Moon (1972) and the title role in [...] (1973), which he considered his best film performance, though critics disagreed. Another role which is sometimes referred to as one which he considered his best and is so considered by many critics, is that of Colonel Jock Sinclair in Tunes of Glory (1960). Guinness also played the role of Jamessir Bensonmum, the blind butler, in the 1976 Neil Simon film Murder by Death.|$|E

60|$|I waited till Tom came home, {{looking very}} puffy and bilious about the face; but {{as to his}} intellects, if anything, rather sharper than ever. His report was uncommonly short and pleasant. The inn was {{shutting}} up; Mr. Davager was going to bed in rather a drunken condition; Mr. Davager's friend had never appeared. I sent Tom (properly instructed about keeping <b>our</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> view all the next morning) to his shake-down behind the office-desk, where I heard him hiccoughing half the night, as even the best boys will, when over-excited and too full of tarts.|$|E

While Tom was gone, I found out Joe's name and business, promised to write and tell his mother how finely the regiment went off, and was just expressing a hope that we might meet again, for I too {{was going to the}} war as nurse, when the order to [...] "Fall in!" [...] came rolling down the ranks, and the talk was over. Fearing Tom would miss <b>our</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> the confusion, I kept my eye on him till the boy came rushing up with a packet of tobacco {{in one hand and a}} good supply of cigars in the other. Not a romantic offering, certainly, but a very acceptable one, as Joe's face proved, as we scrambled these treasures into his pockets, all laughing at the flurry, while less fortunate comrades helped us, with an eye to a share of these fragrant luxuries by and by. There was just time for this, a hearty shake of the big hand, and a grateful [...] "Good-by, ma'am;" [...] then the word was given, and they were off. Bent on seeing the last of them, Tom and I took a short cut, and came out on the wide street down which so many troops marched that year; and, mounting some high steps, we watched for our man, as we already called him.|$|E
60|$|In the placid, docile German of to-day, {{whose only}} {{ambition}} {{appears to be}} to pay his taxes, and do what he is told to do by those whom it has pleased Providence to place in authority over him, it is difficult, one must confess, to detect any trace of his wild ancestor, to whom individual liberty was as the breath of his nostrils; who appointed his magistrates to advise, but retained the right of execution for the tribe; who followed his chief, but would have scorned to obey him. In Germany to-day one hears a good deal concerning Socialism, {{but it is a}} Socialism that would only be despotism under another name. Individualism makes no appeal to the German voter. He is willing, nay, anxious, to be controlled and regulated in all things. He disputes, not government, but the form of it. The policeman is to him a religion, and, one feels, will always remain so. In England we regard <b>our</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> blue as a harmless necessity. By the average citizen he is employed chiefly as a signpost, though in busy quarters of the town he is considered useful for taking old ladies across the road. Beyond feeling thankful to him for these services, I doubt if we take much thought of him. In Germany, on the other hand, he is worshipped as a little god and loved as a guardian angel. To the German child he is a combination of Santa Claus and the Bogie Man. All good things come from him: Spielplatze to play in, furnished with swings and giant-strides, sand heaps to fight around, swimming baths, and fairs. All misbehaviour is punished by him. It is the hope of every well-meaning German boy and girl to please the police. To be smiled at by a policeman makes it conceited. A German child that has been patted on the head by a policeman is not fit to live with; its self-importance is unbearable.|$|E
60|$|But {{the dread}} {{of them was}} upon the whole country.

60|$|When {{they came}} nearer to us, {{they seemed to}} be struck with wonder and astonishment, as at a sight which they had, doubtless, never seen before; nor could they, at first, as we {{afterwards}} understood, {{know what to make of}} us.

This very order brought us to an engagement with them, without our designing it; for five or six of the large canoes came so near our long-boat, that <b>our</b> <b>men</b> beckoned with their hands to keep them back, which they understood very well, and went back: but at their retreat about fifty arrows came on board us from those boats, and one of <b>our</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> the long-boat was very much wounded. However, I called to them not to fire by any means; but we handed down some deal boards into the boat, and the carpenter presently set up a kind of fence, like waste boards, to cover them from the arrows of the savages, if they should shoot again.|$|R
