Here, we report a novel field-effect Schottky barrier transistors (FESBT) based on graphene-MoS 2 heterojunction (GMH), where the characteristics of high mobility from graphene and high <b>on-off</b> <b>ratio</b> from MoS 2 are properly balanced in the novel transistors. Large modulation on the device current (on/off ratio of 105) is achieved by adjusting the backgate (through 300 nm SiO 2) voltage to modulate the graphene-MoS 2 Schottky barrier. Moreover, the field effective mobility of the FESBT is up to 58. 7 cm 2 /V. s. Our theoretical analysis shows that if the thickness of oxide is further reduced, a subthreshold swing (SS) of 40 mV/decade can be maintained within three orders of drain current at room temperature. This provides an opportunity to overcome the limitation of 60 mV/decade for conventional CMOS devices.
