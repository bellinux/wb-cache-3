The system may be run in either open-loop or closed-loop mode (with the latter requiring a lambda sensor). Additional features include an engine speed limiter, <b>overrun</b> <b>fuel</b> cut-off, startup fuel enrichment (both during cranking and after startup), and fueling compensation for battery voltage. Some operating parameters are learned by the ECU over time, such as the optimal IAC valve position for a stable idle. This accommodates slight differences in engine wear and tune between different engines.|$|E
40|$|The {{conceptual}} {{design of the}} power sector model in any country is to allocate different sources of risks among different agents (generators, traders and consumers) {{through a set of}} (market) rules such that the tariff for the final consumer is the least possible. Two alternatives for selling the electricity are usually available for generators: spot and contract sales. Each one presents opportunities and risks. For example, contract sales are good mechanisms to mitigate energy spot prices volatilities. But contract sales can also bring hydrological risks for hydro generators, associated with the inability to deliver the contracted amount during the dry periods. The objective is then to devise a competitive pricing strategy that is sufficient to remunerate investment, cover operating costs and hedge the project against the different sources of risks. For spot sales, the challenge is to verify if forecasted energy spot prices can recover investment and operational costs. Risks may be understood as the uncertainties associated with project returns caused by hydrology, market prices, costs <b>overruns,</b> construction delays, <b>fuel</b> prices, and others. A proper assessment of the diverse types of risks associated to the project is extremely important when managing their economical impacts by the investors. An interesting aspect is the relative effect of the risks among the projects when analyzing investment alternatives. Projects using different technologies may have the same competitiveness in terms of expecte...|$|R
500|$|Aloy {{locates the}} {{remnants}} of the company Faro Automated Solutions and discovers that the old world was destroyed nearly 1000 years ago after Faro lost control of its automated [...] "peacekeeper" [...] military robots. The robots, which could self-replicate and consumed biomass as <b>fuel,</b> <b>overran</b> the planet and consumed the biosphere, stripping Earth of all life. Project Zero Dawn, a top secret project spearheaded by Dr. Sobeck, was a plan to create an automated terraforming system to eventually shut the robots down and restore life to Earth. Aloy is then contacted by Sylens (Lance Reddick), a secretive figure interested in uncovering what happened to the [...] "Old Ones". Aloy eventually learns that Dr. Sobeck was sent to an Orbital Launch Base to complete Zero Dawn and Sylens reveals that the base is located under the Citadel, the centre of Eclipse power. Aloy heads for the base and inside, she learns that Zero Dawn was a vast underground system of databases, factories, and cloning facilities all controlled by a single artificial intelligence named GAIA (Lesley Ewen). Once all life had been extinguished, GAIA developed a countermeasure to deactivate all of the Faro robots and then build its own robots to restore the Earth's biosphere. Once the planet was habitable again, GAIA reseeded life on Earth based on stored DNA and taught the first human clones not to repeat their predecessors' past mistakes. It is also revealed that HADES was one of GAIA's subsystems designed to enact controlled extinction if the outcome of Zero Dawn was not favourable for human existence. Aloy reaches Dr. Sobeck's office, where she downloads a registry to give her access to the door from which she was born. She is captured by Helis and sentenced to death at the Citadel, but escapes with the help of Sylens.|$|R
