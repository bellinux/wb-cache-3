It did not help matters that so many men were called into the forces to fight for the Kaiser; the bulk of the work thus fell to women, children and the elderly. Schools gave schoolchildren time off classes to help with the work (indeed, in 1915 school was out for 7½ months after the schoolteacher was conscripted). The workload was eased somewhat by help from Russian and later also French and British prisoners of war, who were housed at the old schoolhouse, and guarded by a man from Horbruch. One of the Russians escaped. There were 10 prisoners of war in Krummenau in 1918.|$|E

30|$|Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacques) is {{the most}} {{important}} plant commodity in Malaysia, covering more than 5 million hectares in 2012. This oil crop is currently the world’s top commodity <b>oil-bearing</b> <b>crop,</b> with about 3.5 tons of oil per hectare produced annually in Malaysian plantations (Basiron 2012; Kirkland 2011; Barcelos et al. 2015). Palm oil is versatile and nutritious, free of trans-isomer fat and rich in vitamins and antioxidants (Hayes and Pronczuk 2010; Obahiagbon 2012; Sen et al. 2010). The export of palm oil products makes up between 9.3 and 11.5  % of Malaysia’s total exports and nearly 24.1  % of the global oils and fats export trade in 2011 (Palmoilworld 2014). Therefore, strategically designed and exhaustive research and development has been carried out to ensure the oil palm industry stays competitive and sustainable. On average, crude palm oil contains about 49  % of saturated fatty acids (palmitic acid, 44  % and stearic acid, 5  %) (Sundram 2000; Sundram et al. 2003; Sambanthamurthi et al. 2000).

40|$|Oil palm is {{the most}} {{productive}} <b>oil-bearing</b> <b>crop.</b> Although it is planted on only 5 % of the total world vegetable oil acreage, palm oil accounts for 33 % of vegetable oil and 45 % of edible oil worldwide, but increased cultivation competes with dwindling rainforest reserves. We report the 1. 8 -gigabase (Gb) genome sequence of the African oil palm Elaeis guineensis, the predominant source of worldwide oil production. A total of 1. 535 Gb of assembled sequence and transcriptome data from 30 tissue types were used to predict at least 34, 802 genes, including oil biosynthesis genes and homologues of WRINKLED 1 (WRI 1), and other transcriptional regulators, which are highly expressed in the kernel. We also report the draft sequence of the South American oil palm Elaeis oleifera, which has {{the same number of}} chromosomes (2 n = 32) and produces fertile interspecific hybrids with E. guineensis but seems to have diverged in the New World. Segmental duplications of chromosome arms define the palaeotetraploid origin of palm trees. The oil palm sequence enables the discovery of genes for important traits as well as somaclonal epigenetic alterations that restrict the use of clones in commercial plantings, and should therefore help to achieve sustainability for biofuels and edible oils, reducing the rainforest footprint of this tropical plantation crop. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Indeed, compared to other annual oil crops such as soybean and rapeseed, genetic manipulations remained less important. Therefore, to remain competitive, oil palm growers and breeders need new and novel approaches. In this report, the potential of immature embryos (IE) as {{a useful tool for}} oil palm genetic transformation studies was evaluated. It was evident that IEs were amenable to both direct and Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer. Due to the abundant supply of IE, optimization of biolistic and Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer into IEs were easily carried out. Transient transformation frequencies were comparable to other plant systems reported, with as high as 97. 4 % recorded for biolistic and 64. 4 % for Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer. Like most moncots, oil palm tissues were less sensitive to kanamycin, geneticin and chloramphenicol. Instead, both hygromycin and phosphinotrycin were toxic 20 mg/l, making both suitable candidates for selecting putative transformants. IEs were also more responsive to in vitro manipulations as compared to other explants such as leaf and root tissues. Rapid in vitro response to callusing and embryogenesis or rapid and highly efficient direct germination resulted in a shorter culture period. This would minimize the production of abnormal clonal palms, which has been associated to chromosomal aberration due to prolonged time in culture. In addition, IEs also allows rapid and direct introduction of elite genes into breeding programs and in biclonal seed production...|$|R

N. sativa is believed to be investigated for the first time as a biodiesel feedstock while C. pentandra has been reported recently in few studies. Owing to higher acid value, acid-esterification and alkali-transesterification processes have been carried out for biodiesel production. The fuel properties of C. pentandra methyl ester (CPME), N. sativa methyl ester (NSME) and their feedstock mixture (NSME/CPME) are determined. It has been found that the produced biodiesel from respective feedstocks matches the properties set by ASTM 6751 standards.

40|$|Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) {{grown on}} land with {{elevated}} arsenic concentration can absorb and accumulate {{high levels of}} arsenic. B. juncea is an important <b>oil-bearing</b> <b>crop</b> and broadly grown in Bangladesh and West Bengal, where the land is heavily contaminated with arsenic. Arsenic is documented as a group 1 carcinogen and can enter the biosphere through the food chain. With the high population density and a heavy agriculture-based economy in Bangladesh and West Bengal, issues related to food safety must be addressed {{to solve the problems}} associated with arsenic accumulation in B. juncea seed oil, which is caused by B. juncea tolerance to arsenic toxicity. Therefore, it is important to study the variation of arsenic tolerance among different Indian mustard cultivars and to understand the genetic mechanisms of arsenic tolerance in Indian mustard. Such results from the study could help to reduce potential arsenic toxicity in both plants and humans through diet as well as to benefit local agriculture industry in Bangladesh and West Bengal. In this research, a consistent trend was found between arsenic concentration and biomass accumulation in all B. juncea cultivars. When arsenic concentration increases, the biomass accumulation decreases. A positive correlation was identified between arsenic tolerance levels in B. juncea roots and arsenic absorption in the seed and seed oil. The observation of these correlations in B. juncea suggests that breeding arsenic resistant B. juncea cultivars could increase plant yield but may inadvertently lead to an increased arsenic concentrations in the seed and seed oil. However, variations in arsenic accumulation were observed in both arsenic resistant and susceptible cultivars, which provide possibilities to breed high arsenic-tolerant and low arsenic-absorptive strains of B. juncea. To study the genetic mechanisms underlying arsenic tolerance variation in Indian mustard, the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana was employed. Arsenic tolerance of various A. thaliana accessions was measured and arsenic tolerance genes were screened using a genetic mapping approach. Since no consistent trend was found between arsenic concentrations and arsenic tolerance in A. thaliana root and shoot tissues, it suggests that arsenic has a complex impact on those phenotypes examined in A. thaliana. To study the mechanisms underlying genetic variation of A. thaliana for arsenic tolerance, gene mapping including quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and genome-wide association mapping (GWAS) was employed to identify targeted genomic regions and candidate genes. One recombined inbred population was employed in QTL mapping and a worldwide collection of 39 A. thaliana accessions was used in GWAS analysis. QTL mapping analysis and GWAS revealed similar genomic regions and candidate genes. Among all revealed candidate genes, one gene (gene ID: At 5 G 05560) with a known function of abiotic stress resistance was identified, which may be related to plant arsenic tolerance or detoxification. To understand the function of this gene, however, requires further analysis. Other genes associated with arsenic tolerance or detoxification function in the genetic region selected from gene mapping study may also be identified by further analysis. The functional analysis of candidate genes, and the molecular markers selection from revealed genomic regions could be applied to contribute to breeding B. juncea strains with higher arsenic tolerance and lower arsenic accumulation...|$|R

These photosynthetic microorganisms have great potential to be the solution to the growing energy and environmental challenges, as a more efficient method for bioenergy production and a practical and environmentally responsible method for carbon dioxide sequestration. We have established a collection of many microalgae, specifically the native strains that adapt well to local environmental conditions and can resist the invasion by undesirable species.

40|$|As {{mentioned}} by Jenkins (10) {{the position of}} flax on the prairies is being challenged by other <b>oil-bearing</b> <b>crops,</b> {{but it is still}} important from the plant breeding standpoint. The diversification in oil crops is related to the increased use of oils other than linseed oil in the manufacture of paints and also to the rapidly expanding use of vegetable oils for edible purposes. Linseed oil has long been recognized as an oil with a high iodine value, that is, an oil with a fast drying ability. However, the iodine value of edible oils is relatively low. Sallans and Sinclair (16) emphasized that {{it may be possible to}} divide the flax crop on the basis of iodine value in order to utilize the part with low iodine value in the edible oil and soap industries. This would give flax a better chance to compete with other oil bearing crops such as sunflowers, safflower and soybeans, since flax is already a well adapted crop, except for its limited usefulness. As Sallans and Sinclair (16) reported there is great variability in the iodine value of linseed oil. It might be possible to produce a flax variety with a high oil content and a low iodine number. The improvement of flax is also based on yield. Since yield is determined by seed size, number of seeds per boll and number of bolls per plant, the study of these characters and their relationship seemed worthy of investigation.

Nigella sativa is believed to be investigated for the first time as a biodiesel feedstock. Biodiesel seems to be a replacement to the diesel, can be commonly produced by esterification-transesterification. In the current research a new method i. e. direct transesterification is developed and compared it with conventional esterificationtransesterification. The fuel properties of biodiesel produced by both methods are investigated and compared. Though there are no significant differences in the fuel properties obtained from either of the methods but the acid value of biodiesel and reaction time reduced significantly besides improved biodiesel yield by direct transesterification method. The direct transesterification method was further improved to modified direct transesterification method for minimizing the time required for biodiesel separation from glycerol and blending of diesel and biodiesel. Today’s automobiles require economy of operation, high power output and last but not the least, reduction in greenhouse gases emitted by the vehicles.

There are many of the <b>oil-bearing</b> <b>crops</b> identified to be sources for biodiesel fuel but only soybean,palm,sunflower,cottonseed,peanut oil and safflower considered as well (Goering et al., 1982; Pryor et al., 1982) However,recently Jatropha Curcas oil {{was found to be}} potential source of biodiesel since it is non-edible oil and contains a high percentage of oil in the seed compared to the other non-edible oil. There are three methods to produce biodiesel,which are (1) base catalyzed transesterification, (2) acid catalyzed esterification,and(3) enzymatic catalysis (Kiss, 2009) The commonly used in industry is the base catalyst trans-esterification due to lower cost of production. However,this method will form soap as the by product and need a further step to obtain biodiesel. Therefore in the present study,esterification of oleic acid catalyzed by zinc acetate using subcritical methanol is used which taken from previous study done Song et al., 2009. In this study,reactive distillation will be used to produce the biodiesel where the reaction and separation will be taken part in the same unit operation.

Na cidade de Floriano existem impactos indiretos a partir da instalação da Usina, e provavelmente o aumento com as despesas sociais seja efeito do aumento da arrecadação tributária indireta, dada à euforia que vive a cidade em torno da Usina. Existem alguns pontos que a empresa ainda necessita verificar que são sua atuação junto ao poder público municipal e instituições locais, e suas estratégias de produção de mamona, pôde-se perceber na pesquisa a falta de alinhamento de alguns produtores com as estratégias da empresa, e isso poderá vir a tornar-se um gargalo para o abastecimento das usinas. Essa integração entre grande empresa e produção familiar é uma forma socialmente apropriada de fazer negócio, em que o lucro vem associado a uma maior inserção social de seus colaboradores e parceiros, mas necessita de reciprocidade para dar certo. The recent {{moves towards}} {{the insertion of}} biofuels in the energy matrix {{of a number of}} countries are opening new prospects for agricultural production and for agroindustrial chains. In Brazil, the Programa Nacional do Biodiesel (National Biodiesel Program) was created to establish the regulatory framework for the production, commercialization and consumption of Biodiesel. Besides the traditional production of biodiesel from soybean oil, the first productive bases using alternative oilbearing crops such as the castor bean, sunflower, palm and rapeseed are beginning to appear. The emergence of this new productive base raises new research issues: in what circumstances are the structuring, organization and implementation of these biodiesel productive chains taking place in Brazil? What are the effects of biodiesel production on local economies? Hence, the central objective of this study is the development and validation of an analytical structure capable of characterizing the biodiesel productive arrangements and identifying their economic and social impacts at the regions where they are installed. The analytical structure was constructed based on theories of regional and spatial economy: locational coefficient, Shift-Share, theories of industrial location. The biorefinery concept was used to identify the factors related to the management of biodiesel processing plants. A preliminary analysis identified that a biodiesel productive arrangement is emerging in the State of Piauí, Northeastern Brazil, with the purpose of stimulating regional development using alternative oilbearing crops. The firm Brasil Ecodiesel has established an industrial plant in the municipality of Floriano (Piauí) and a farm for the production of castor beans and other <b>oil-bearing</b> <b>crops</b> in the municipality of Canto do Buriti. Executives from the firm together with local agents and leaders (from local government, unions and commercial and industrial associations) {{were asked to respond to}} questionnaires related to the agricultural production destined to supply the processing plant. A survey of secondary data on the regional economy was also carried out. In order to govern and coordinate its productive chain Brasil Ecodiesel created an organizational structure responsible for the management of more than 630 contracts with local rural producers for the supply of oleaginous crops and regional offices to offer technical assistance and support to the producers. It can be seen that the local production of non-traditional <b>oil-bearing</b> <b>crops</b> (castor bean) has proven insufficient to meet the production needs of the firm. Due to this productive insufficiency, the supply of vegetable oil for the processing unit is ensured by obtaining soybean oil from locations far from the production plant (300 - 500 km), thus increasing the production costs. The agricultural project in the town of Canto do Buriti has faced problems of both a cultural and productive nature. The Federal Government’s social assistance projects (e. g. Family pocket, basic basket, [...] .) have the effect of reducing the commitment of the rural producers to the production performance objectives. Unfavorable edaphoclimatic conditions have also reduced the productivity levels of the local plantations. On the other hand, the impact of the new biodiesel production base is already perceptible in the town of Floriano. Calculations show an increase in the dynamism of the local retail market and civil construction. Preliminary findings reveal productive, organizational, managerial and governance related difficulties and challenges that need to be faced when establishing a new productive base in a location that up to that point lacks a productive tradition...|$|E
