She had intended that, after 1977, her retirement from the Aldeburgh Festival would be total, but she made an exception in 1980 when she organised a 70th birthday celebration concert for Pears.|$|E
5|$|Holmboe {{published}} his first textbook in mathematics in 1825. The 274-page book was named Lærebog i Mathematiken. Første Deel (Textbook in Mathematics. Part One). In 1827 he followed {{with the second}} volume, Lærebog i Mathematiken. Anden Deel (Textbook in Mathematics. Part Two), consisting of a further 155 pages. He used his <b>own</b> <b>teaching</b> experience as the background for his writing; mainly abstract, {{the purpose of the}} books was to instill logical thinking. For instance, in the field geometry, it enticed readers to envisage a figure instead of putting it to paper. The books became widely used, and were reprinted in four and five volumes respectively.|$|E

25|$|The {{colleges are}} self-governing {{institutions}} {{with their own}} endowments and property, founded as integral parts of the university. All students and most academics are attached to a college. Their importance lies in the housing, welfare, social functions, and undergraduate teaching they provide. All faculties, departments, research centres, and laboratories belong to the university, which arranges lectures and awards degrees, but undergraduates receive their supervisions—small-group teaching sessions, often with just one student—within the colleges. Each college appoints its <b>own</b> <b>teaching</b> staff and fellows, who are also members of a university department. The colleges also decide which undergraduates to admit to the university, in accordance with university regulations.|$|E

The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.|$|E

He lived there {{for the first six}} years of his life before his parents moved to Kings Norton in 1918, where he lived until 1930. He was the only child of Albert Enoch Powell (1872–1956), a primary school headmaster, and his wife, Ellen Mary (1886–1953). Ellen was the {{daughter}} of Henry Breese, a Liverpool policeman and his wife Eliza, who had given up her <b>own</b> <b>teaching</b> career after marrying. His mother did not like his name, and as a child he was known as 'Jack'. At the age of three, Powell was nicknamed 'the Professor' because he used to stand on a chair and describe the stuffed birds his grandfather had shot, which were displayed in his parents' home.|$|E
25|$|Mirroring the {{historical}} political {{conflicts between the}} freethought and Catholic segments of the population, the Flemish educational system is split into a secular branch controlled by the communities, the provinces, or the municipalities, and a subsidised religious—mostly Catholic—branch. For the subsidised schools, the main costs such as the teacher's wages and building maintenance completely borne by the Flemish government. Subsidised schools are also free to determine their <b>own</b> <b>teaching</b> and examination methods, but in exchange, they {{must be able to}} prove that certain minimal terms are achieved by keeping records of the given lessons and exams. It should however be noted that—at least for the Catholic schools—the religious authorities have very limited power over these schools, neither do the schools have a lot of power on their own. Instead, the Catholic schools are a member of the Catholic umbrella organisation VSKO. The VSKO determines most practicalities for schools, like the advised schedules per study field. However, there's freedom of education in Flanders, which doesn't only mean that every pupil can choose his/her preferred school, but also that every organisation can found a school, and even be subsidised when abiding the different rules. This resulted also in some smaller school systems follow 'methodical pedagogies' (e.g. Steiner, Montessori, or Freinet) or serve the Jewish and Protestant minorities.|$|E
25|$|The main {{belief of}} The Nation of Islam and its {{followers}} {{is that there}} is no god but Allah. Their most important worship is praying five times a day. The official beliefs as stated by the Nation of Islam have been outlined in books, documents, and articles published by the organization as well as speeches by Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, Louis Farrakhan, and other ministers. Many of Elijah Muhammad's teachings may be found in Message to the Blackman in America and The True History of Jesus as Taught by the Honorable Elijah Muhammad (Chicago: Coalition for the Remembrance of Elijah, 1992). Many of MalcolmX's teachings of NOI theology are in his The End of White World Supremacy, while a later more critical discussion of those beliefs can be found in The Autobiography of Malcolm X, co-written with Alex Haley. It is important to note that near the end of Malcolm X's life, Malcolm, along with Elijah Muhammad's son, Wallace Muhammad, broke away from major parts of Elijah Muhammad's theology. This was spurred originally by immoral actions by Elijah Muhammad, which were in-congruent with the Nations <b>own</b> <b>teaching,</b> but then mainly from Malcolm's experience at the Hajj Pilgrimage to Mecca. Malcolm, following Wallace's footsteps, along with many other followers entered traditional Islam (Autobiography of Malcolm X). They rejected that Fard Muhammad was God incarnate, as God cannot be in human form, and that Elijah Muhammad was a prophet sent by God, as the Prophet Muhammad from 570 CE to 632 CE is the last prophet for humankind, according to Islam - Qur'an Verse 40, Surah Al-Ahzab (chapter 33).|$|E

2500|$|Aberrant {{interpretation}} of prophecy—Before 1844 many Protestant and Catholic theologians supported the day-year principle and, like Miller, advocated that (Daniel 8:14) indeed ends in 1844. The Adventist interpretation {{is consistent with}} Jesus <b>own</b> <b>teaching</b> in Matt. 13 and 24. In both instances where He uses the term [...] "Abomination of Desolation", He points to it as being yet future, not 200 years prior as is required if one believes the application is to Antiochus Epiphanes. Furthermore, the term evening, morning in scripture always indicates a single day i.e.: the evening and the morning were the first day, the evening and the morning were the second day, etc. in Genesis 1. Finally, neither 2300 days, nor 1150 days fits the historical facts of Antiochus Epiphanes profanation of the temple which lasted for 3 years or for his temporal reign which lasted from 175-164BC.|$|E

Initially, TAG students were taught alongside the students at the other magnet schools, TAG instruction was cut from seven classes to three, and TAG teachers from thirteen to four.
