40|$|Objective: The {{national}} shortage <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adolescent psychiatrists {{has prompted}} {{efforts to improve}} recruitment. It is uncertain whether these efforts will be sufficient to address this shortage {{and its impact on}} youth mental health services. Method: Data were compared from 1990 to 2001 by state, county characteristics, number of youths, and percentage of youths living in poverty to determine any changes in the number <b>and</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adolescent psychiatrists. Trends in the number of residents <b>and</b> age distribution <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adolescent psychiatrists were also analyzed. Results: The number <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adolescent psychiatrists has increased, but it still falls below estimates projected to adequately serve youth mental health needs. Disparities in <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adolescent psychiatrist distribution persist, with significantly fewer in rural counties or counties with a high percentage <b>of</b> <b>children</b> living in poverty. The age <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adolescent psychiatrists has shifted, with fewer below age 35. The number of residents in training has not changed significantly since 1995. Conclusions: The shortage <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adolescent psychiatrists remains and is still accentuated for those living in rural areas or in poverty. Despite the increased number <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adolescent psychiatrists, the number of residents and changes in workforce age indicate that the shortage will continue. J. Am. Acad.

5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language. People making use of AAC include individuals {{with a variety of}} congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as My Left Foot and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.|$|E
