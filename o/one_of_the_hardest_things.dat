Maggie Roswell was given the role of Maude, Ned's loving wife, and became a regular cast member with this episode. She had previously played supporting parts in the show's first season. Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart, commented on Roswell's acting: [...] "Maggie has been blessed with a skill in creating <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> to create: the 'normal sound,' whatever that is.

500|$|With Frusciante {{in place}} and Peligro still on drums, the band {{embarked}} on a small tour and began writing music for the next album. It wasn't long though before the band felt they needed to part ways with Peligro as well, who had his own personal drug problems. Peligro, who helped co-write [...] "Stone Cold Bush", [...] "Taste the Pain" [...] and [...] "Sexy Mexican Maid" [...] for the Mother's Milk album, was fired in late November 1988.

500|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} at Record Two Studio in Comptche, California. While recording the song, {{it began to}} develop differently from the original vision. Pike stated that the [...] "song was getting slower and slower and then it got weird. We started tripping out and second guessing ourselves." [...] Recording the album was difficult. Pike recalled that [...] "there was so much to memorize for that album, {{and we had to}} do it in like three different sections because a reel-to-reel only holds 22 minutes. It was really cool, but it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> I've ever done in in my life."

500|$|In {{addition}} to her live action roles, Roswell did some voice acting in animated films and shows, including the voice of Teegra in Fire and Ice from 1983. This led to her being hired on the animated television series The Simpsons in 1989. Her first appearance was in the season one episode [...] "Homer's Night Out", in which she voiced the character Princess Kashmir (a belly dancer who seduces Homer). Out of the total thirteen episodes of the first season, Maggie Roswell appeared in four; however, they were only minor roles. Maggie Roswell did not become a regular cast member {{until the middle of}} the second season in the episode [...] "Dead Putting Society" [...] (1990), with the introduction of Maude Flanders (neighbor to the Simpson family and the loving wife of Ned Flanders). Maggie Roswell went on to voice other recurring characters on the show, such as Helen Lovejoy (the reverend's wife), Miss Hoover (an elementary school teacher), and Luann Van Houten (a housewife and mother), as well as several more one-time characters and background characters. Fellow Simpsons cast member Nancy Cartwright wrote in her autobiography that [...] "Maggie Roswell has been blessed with a skill in creating <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> to create: the 'normal sound,' whatever that is. So she can easily slip into the gal next door or any number of assorted reporters, medical students, jury members, accountants, scientists and moms." [...] Roswell was nominated for an Emmy Award for her work on The Simpsons. She also received a 1997 Annie Award nomination in the category [...] "Best Individual Achievement: Voice Acting by a Female Performer in a TV Production" [...] for her role as Sharry Bobbins in the episode [...] "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious", but lost to June Foray.|$|E

[...] said Zorn, [...] "I have to be there with them, and that's why I started playing saxophone, so that I could meet musicians.

2500|$|Investors are {{generally}} most attracted to those new companies distinguished by their strong co-founding team, a balanced [...] "risk/reward" [...] profile (in which high risk {{due to the}} untested, disruptive innovations is balanced out by high potential returns) and [...] "scalability" [...] (the likelihood that a startup can expand its operations by serving more markets or more customers). Attractive startups generally have lower [...] "bootstrapping" [...] (self-funding of startups by the founders) costs, higher risk, and higher potential return on investment. Successful startups are typically more scalable than an established business, {{in the sense that}} the startup has the potential to grow rapidly with a limited investment of capital, labor or land.

2500|$|On 20 April 1942, he {{surrendered}} to the Japanese. He was taken to prison-camps first at Sukabumi and then to Bandung. Van der Post was famous {{for his work in}} maintaining the morale of prisoners of many different nationalities. Along with others, he organised a [...] "camp university" [...] with courses from basic literacy to degree-standard ancient history, and he also organized a camp farm to supplement nutritional needs. He could also speak some basic Japanese, which helped him greatly. Once, depressed, he wrote in his diary: [...] "It is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> in this prison life: the strain caused by being continually in the power of people who are only half-sane and live in a twilight of reason and humanity." [...] He wrote about his prison experiences in A Bar of Shadow (1954), The Seed and the Sower (1963) and The Night of the New Moon (1970). Japanese film director Nagisa Oshima based his film Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1982) on the last two of these books.|$|E
2500|$|Dillahunt took {{inspiration}} from Andrew Cunanan, {{the man who}} killed Gianni Versace, when he recalled the brutality in which Cunanan murdered a man just for his car. Dillahunt recalls how an FBI profiler noted that this type of rage is typically directed toward someone the perpetrator knows, yet Cunanan managed to pull some element from his own life and place it on this random person who attempted to stand his ground against the would-be carjacker. To Dillahunt, that was how he wanted to approach Krug. To him, Mari actually shows that she is not afraid of Krug, which causes him to go [...] "crazy". That being said, the actor felt like the scene where his character rapes Mari was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> emotionally to film. He notes that part of him was happy that Sara Paxton was cast as Mari, because they had worked together in the past, so they knew each other. On the other hand, he felt uncomfortable acting out such a scene with a person he considered to be a friend. Paxton echoed his sentiments to Craven, who stated the actress expressed to him a greater feeling of trust that the person who would have to do these [...] "horrible" [...] things to her was someone she knew, and as a result made them at least partially more bearable to act.|$|E
