40|$|The {{last two}} decades have {{witnessed}} that countries across the world are guided by {{the rules and regulations}} of multilateral trading institutions (for example, World Trade organization [WTO], International Monetary Fund [IMF]) in order to promote free and fair trade through gradual reduction in trade barriers. The World economy has noticed significant reduction in tariffs, yet we find a rise in non-tariff barriers (NTBs). However, we still find dumping and few other trade strategies of the exporting countries as a major hindrance to free and fair trade. Such behaviour has led to “contingent protection” as a tool of new-protectionism. Among the contingent protection measures, anti-dumping (AD) has evolved as the most popular choice of strategy for the trading nations. The AD policy invokes a threat to the exporter and thereby can change its strategic behaviour. We describe the phenomenon of dumping through a price-leadership model and thereby compute the optimal level of anti-dumping duty that can <b>offset</b> <b>dumping.</b> Using a sequential game, we conclude that the credible threat of an AD duty restricts dumping and thereby leads to a win-win situation for both the foreign and domestic firms. ...|$|E

The purpose of scheduling backfill {{is to do}} volume balance between out-pit and in-pit dumping and control amount low grade that goes to stockpile and calculate distances hauled during mining process. The material scheduled divided into overburden, low grade, and ore. The material could be sent to following destinations, overburden to in-pit and out-pit dumps, low grade to in-pit, out-put dumps, stockpiles, and ore to stockpiles only. In controlling dumping sequence, there are three consideration constraints: geotechnical, capacity, and haul distance. Geotechnical constraints use dump slope which ensures maximum dump overall slope angle not exceed 13 - 15 degree, also <b>offset</b> <b>dump</b> to face, assist specified distance (50 m) between toe of working face and “toe” of dumps. This di stance must sufficient to allow operation such ore loading and water handling safely and efficiently. Second constraint is capacity that control amount low grade sent to stockpiles. Haul distance as third constraint is way to dump close to current mining o peration. By managing low grade material, when processing technology adequate, those material can be extracted. This shows Antam's good will of resource conservation that conform with sustainability...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of single}} stage bunch {{compressor}} (BC) in the International Linear Collider (ILC) Damping Ring to the Main Linac beamline (RTML) requires new {{design for the}} extraction line (EL). The EL located downstream of the BC {{will be used for}} both an emergency abort dumping of the beam and the tune-up continuous train-by-train extraction. It must accept both compressed and uncompressed beam with energy spread of 3. 54 % and 0. 15 % respectively. In this paper we report the final design that allowed minimizing the length of such extraction line while <b>offsetting</b> the beam <b>dumps</b> from the main line by 5 m distance required for acceptable radiation level in the service tunnel. Proposed extraction line can accommodate beams with different energy spreads at the same time providing the beam size suitable for the aluminum ball dump window. We described the final design of the ILC RTML extraction line located downstream of the new single-stage bunch compressor. The extraction line is only 24 m long and is capable of accepting and transmitting 220 kW of beam power. The EL can be used for both fast intra-train and continual extraction, and is capable of accepting both 0. 15 % and 3. 54 % energy spread beams at 5 MeV and 4. 37 MeV respectively...|$|R
40|$|M. B. A. According to du Plessis et al., (1994 : 67), {{the history}} of {{protectionism}} in trade goes almost {{as far back as}} that of trade itself. There are various arguments for the numerous benefits, which can be gained from free trade such as, efficiency and welfare gains. But, despite these benefits, governments have had counter arguments as to why protectionism is justified. Examples of these traditional arguments for protection are, the infant industry argument, the terms of trade argument, protection to increase employment in an industry, a tariff to <b>offset</b> foreign <b>dumping</b> and a tariff to improve the balance of payments. All of these arguments have important gains for the protected economy but could be considered beggar-thyneighbour policies since they are {{at the expense of the}} unprotected economy. Various trade instruments are used by governments to intervene in its countries trading activities. These trade instruments are categorised into, tariff, non-tariff barriers and export taxes and subsidies. Both tariff and non-tariff barriers are used to interfere on the import side of trade, whereas export subsidies and taxes are used to interfere with the free flow of exports. Tariff barriers include specific tariffs, ad valorem tariffs, import subsidies, preferential duties, most-favoured nation treatment and offshore assembly provisions. Nontariff barriers include import quotas, "voluntary" export restraints, government procurement provisions, local content provisions, administrative classification and restriction on service trade (du Plessis et al., 1994 : 67 - 70). An example of a protected industry in South Africa is the motor industry. The initial protectionist programmes used by the motor industry were characterised by local content policies. These programmes resulted in a heavily protected motor and component industry. In recent years, policymakers have attempted to reduce the level of protection in the industry through the Motor Industry Development Programme (MIDP), in line with the General Trade and Tariff Agreement (GATT). This programme is not only attempting to reduce the use of trade instruments but, also to become globally competitive. This dissertation attempts to evaluate the effects that protectionism, in the form of the Motor Industry Development Programme, has had on the Motor Industry's component suppliers...|$|R
40|$|The ILC [1] Damping Ring to the Main Linac beamline (RTML) {{contains}} three extraction lines (EL). Each EL can be {{used both}} for an emergency abort dumping of the beam and tune-up continual train-by-train extraction. Two of the extraction lines are located downstream {{of the first and}} second stages of the RTML bunch compressor, and must accept both compressed and uncompressed beam with energy spreads of 2. 5 % and 0. 15 %, respectively. In this paper we report on an optics design that allowed minimizing the length of the extraction lines while <b>offsetting</b> the beam <b>dumps</b> from the main line by the distance required for acceptable radiation levels in the service tunnel. The proposed extraction lines can accommodate beams with different energy spreads {{while at the same time}} providing the beam size acceptable for the aluminum dump window. The RTML incorporates three extraction lines, which {{can be used}} for either an emergency beam abort or for a train-by-train extraction. The first EL is located downstream of the Damping Ring extraction arc. The other two extraction lines are located downstream of each stage of the two-stage bunch compressor. The first extraction line (EL 1) receives 5 GeV beam with an 0. 15 % energy spread. The extraction line located downstream of the first stage of bunch compressor (ELBC 1) receives both compressed and uncompressed beam, and therefore must accept beam with both 5 and 4. 88 GeV energy, and 0. 15 % and 2. 5 % energy spread, respectively. The extraction line located after the second stage of the bunch compressor (ELBC 2) receives 15 GeV beam with either 0. 15 or 1. 8 % energy spread. Each of the three extraction lines is equipped with the 220 kW aluminum ball dump, which corresponds to the power of the continuously dumped beam with 5 GeV energy, i. e., the beam trains must be delivered to the ELBC 2 dump at reduced repetition rate...|$|R
