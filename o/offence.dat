5|$|The Act {{created a}} new <b>offence</b> for {{publishing}} obscene material, repealing the common law <b>offence</b> of obscene libel which was previously used, and also allows Justices of the Peace to issue warrants allowing the police to seize such materials.

The Act has been used in several high-profile cases, such as the trials of Penguin Books for publishing Lady Chatterley's Lover and Oz for the Schoolkids OZ issue.|$|E
5|$|The Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 {{provides}} for Ofcom to issue licences to radio broadcasters {{for the use}} of stations and wireless telegraphy apparatus. The Act sets out a number of criminal offences relating to wireless telegraphy, including the establishment or use of a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of making an unlicensed broadcast. The financing or participating in the day-to-day running of unlicensed broadcasting is also a criminal <b>offence,</b> as is the supplying of a sound recording for an unlicensed station and advertising through unlicensed stations. The Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 allows Ofcom to take a number of actions against individuals committing these offences, including power of entry and search and seizure of equipment. It is a criminal <b>offence</b> to obstruct a person exercising enforcement powers on Ofcom's behalf. Furthermore, the Broadcasting Act 1990 provides that anyone convicted of an unlawful broadcasting <b>offence</b> is disqualified from holding a broadcasting licence for five years.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} was {{confused by the}} legal position. Disturbing a grave was a criminal <b>offence,</b> as was the taking of property from the deceased. Stealing the body was not an <b>offence,</b> as it did not legally belong to anyone. The price per corpse changed depending on the season. It was Â£8 during the summer, when the warmer temperatures brought on quicker decomposition, and Â£10 in the winter months, when the demand by anatomists was greater, because the colder temperatures meant they could store corpses longer so they undertook more dissections.|$|E

Accordingly, the Attorney General's consent is required if {{more than three years}} has elapsed, or where the defendant has already been prosecuted in the circumstances alleged to have resulted in the victim's death.|$|E
