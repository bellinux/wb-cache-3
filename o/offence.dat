The Act has been used in several high-profile cases, such as the trials of Penguin Books for publishing Lady Chatterley's Lover and Oz for the Schoolkids OZ issue.|$|E
5|$|The Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 {{provides}} for Ofcom to issue licences to radio broadcasters {{for the use}} of stations and wireless telegraphy apparatus. The Act sets out a number of criminal offences relating to wireless telegraphy, including the establishment or use of a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of making an unlicensed broadcast. The financing or participating in the day-to-day running of unlicensed broadcasting is also a criminal <b>offence,</b> as is the supplying of a sound recording for an unlicensed station and advertising through unlicensed stations. The Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 allows Ofcom to take a number of actions against individuals committing these offences, including power of entry and search and seizure of equipment. It is a criminal <b>offence</b> to obstruct a person exercising enforcement powers on Ofcom's behalf. Furthermore, the Broadcasting Act 1990 provides that anyone convicted of an unlawful broadcasting <b>offence</b> is disqualified from holding a broadcasting licence for five years.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} was {{confused by the}} legal position. Disturbing a grave was a criminal <b>offence,</b> as was the taking of property from the deceased. Stealing the body was not an <b>offence,</b> as it did not legally belong to anyone. The price per corpse changed depending on the season. It was £8 during the summer, when the warmer temperatures brought on quicker decomposition, and £10 in the winter months, when the demand by anatomists was greater, because the colder temperatures meant they could store corpses longer so they undertook more dissections.|$|E

Accordingly, the Attorney General's consent is required if {{more than three years}} has elapsed, or where the defendant has already been prosecuted in the circumstances alleged to have resulted in the victim's death.|$|E
