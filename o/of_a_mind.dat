5|$|Ambassador Soval is summoned before Administrator V'Las and the High Council to face {{punishment}} {{over his}} use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> meld. Since {{the act is}} widely considered to be criminal by the Vulcan authorities, Soval is summarily dismissed from the Ambassadorial service. Meanwhile, Captain Archer and Commander T'Pol are questioned by the Syrrannites. After a short while, T'Pol is taken to see her mother, T'Les, and the two disagree about the tenets of the group — the Vulcan authorities call them extremists, a term T'Les disagrees with. Soon, Archer begins to see visions of an old Vulcan, and the dissidents determine {{that he had the}} katra of Surak transferred into him via mind meld.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Cetacean Institute, Taylor's workplace, {{was created}} by using the real-life Monterey Bay Aquarium. A holding tank for the whales was added via special effects to the Aquarium's exterior. For close-ups of the {{characters}} as they watched the whales in the tank, the Aquarium's walls and railings were measured and replicated for a set on the Paramount parking lot. One scene takes place by a large glass through which observers view the whales—and Spock's initiation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> meld—underwater. Footage of the actors shot {{in front of them}} as they reacted to a brick wall in the Aquarium was combined with shots taken from their rear as they stood in front of a large blue screen at ILM to produce this scene. The footage of Spock's melding with the whales was shot weeks later in a large water tank used to train astronauts for weightlessness.|$|E

Braddock is also the most vocal advocate for the extermination of mutants, much to the weariness of Yashida and Frost, who seems much less fanatical in their beliefs. After a failed attempt on his life, Braddock proposes the assembly of the entire Council fleet to attack Apocalypse's capital. However, it is revealed that Braddock had in fact become a victim <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> control device that forced him to act as a mole for Donald Pierce and his Reavers, all servants of Apocalypse. Braddock dies at Pierce's hands when he overcomes his influence and refuses to kill Emma Frost.|$|E
500|$|In late 1949, President Truman asked Dean Acheson to {{concentrate}} {{on the question of whether}} the United States should develop the hydrogen bomb. Acheson formed a working group under the United States National Security Council (NSC) executive secretary Sidney Souers, consisting of R. Gordon Arneson, Paul Nitze and Fisher, who served as the State Department's legal adviser on the project. It was Arneson's view that each member of the working group were of one mind.

Episodes {{would continue to}} be shown out of sequence throughout the series' run. The show scored an 18.7 rating and reviews were largely positive. Variety wrote [...] "If Judy Garland ... is <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> to work every week with the same dedication and zeal that characterized her premiere this week, Bill Paley and his associates should be in clover. ... Miss Garland was in fine fettle." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle characterized the show as [...] "tasteful, elegant and exciting." [...] Not every review was as glowing, with the New York Herald Tribune noting [...] "Miss Garland is fine, just fine. The rest of the show, however, needs help." [...] Other negative reviews were in a similar vein, focusing on Van Dyke in particular and the show's format and writing in general.|$|E

500|$|The Marble Index was {{produced}} during a little-studied period of Nico's life. For The Quietuss Matthew Lindsay, [...] "the liminal drift {{of these years}} only emphasizes the music's amorphous moorings and lack of precedent." [...] Nico approached Danny Fields around the summer of 1968 {{with the desire to}} make an album and prove herself artistically. Resentful of her beauty, she radically changed her image – dyeing her hair red and wearing black clothes in an effort to distance herself from what had made her a popular fashion model. John Cale said, [...] "She hated the idea of being blonde and beautiful, and in some ways she hated being a woman, because she figured all her beauty had brought her was grief... So The Marble Index was an opportunity for her to prove she was a serious artist, not just this kind of blonde bombshell." [...] Nico already had the title for the album in mind from The Prelude, William Wordsworth's magnum opus; in it, he contemplates a statue of Isaac Newton [...] "with his prism and silent face / The marble index <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> for ever / Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone." [...] Asked about the significance of this Wordsworth quote, Nico replied: [...] "I sometimes find a little of my own poetry in other poets, yes. Incidentally, or accidentally." ...|$|E
500|$|Batwoman {{appears in}} the miniseries Cry for Justice, a set-up for a new ongoing Justice League title. When the Justice League of America splits up {{following}} Bruce Wayne's death and a disastrous confrontation with the Shadow Cabinet, Green Lantern Hal Jordan leads a group of superheroes to Gotham in order {{to track down the}} supervillain known as Prometheus. Kate is shown stalking the heroes from the rooftops after they encounter Clayface. Batwoman later contacts both Leagues at the JLA Watchtower, informing them she encountered and engaged supervillain Delores Winters, who mysteriously collapsed and died right as she was about to be taken into custody. The heroes request that Kate bring the body up to them, but she declines, telling them that she is much too busy due to a rash of criminal uprisings going on in Gotham. Firestorm is then sent to retrieve the corpse from Kate and bring it to the team, who discover that Dolores was forced into fighting by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> control device. In a text piece included in [...] #6, writer James Robinson revealed that Batwoman was initially intended to be part of his new Justice League line-up, but this plan fell apart after Cry For Justice was shortened into a miniseries rather than an ongoing title. This explains why Batwoman is present {{on the cover of the}} first issue, and why she was initially said to be a member of the team when the book was first announced.|$|E
500|$|In Utero {{received}} acclaim from critics, {{although some}} reviews were mixed. Times Christopher John Farley stated {{in his review}} of the album, [...] "Despite the fears of some alternative-music fans, Nirvana hasn't gone mainstream, though this potent new album may once again force the mainstream to go Nirvana." [...] Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke said that the album is [...] "a lot of things – brilliant, corrosive, enraged and thoughtful, most of them all at once. But more than anything, it's a triumph of the will." [...] Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne commented [...] "Kurt Cobain hates it all", and noted that the sentiment pervades the record. Browne argued, [...] "The music is often mesmerizing, cathartic rock & roll, but it is rock & roll without release, because the band is suspicious of the old-school rock cliches such a release would evoke." [...] NME magazine's John Mulvey had doubts about the record; he concluded, [...] "As a document <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> in flux – dithering, dissatisfied, unable {{to come to terms}} with sanity – Kurt [...] should be proud of [...] As a follow-up to one of the best records of the past ten years it just isn't quite there." [...] Ben Thompson of The Independent commented that in spite of the album's more abrasive songs, [...] "In Utero is beautiful far more often than it is ugly", and added, [...] "Nirvana have wisely neglected to make the unlistenable punk-rock nightmare they threatened us with." [...] Q magazine felt that the album showcases Cobain's songwriting abilities and wrote, [...] "If this is how Cobain is going to develop, the future is lighthouse-bright". Several critics ranked In Utero as one of the best releases of the year. It placed first and second in the album categories of the Rolling Stone and Village Voice Pazz & Jop year-end critics' polls, respectively. Additionally, The New York Times included it on its list of the top ten albums of the year. The album was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 1994 Grammy Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Mackintosh, like Coleridge, shines {{as one of}} {{the great}} conversationalists in an age of [...] "talkers, not of doers". Arguing cases in a Parliamentary setting, however, offers less {{immediate}} stimulation; in later years, Hazlitt claims, he has grown tired of all that weight of learning, unenlivened by anything new he might have used it for in his imagination.

He held that fortuitous variation (which he also called [...] "sporting"), mechanical necessity, and creative love are the three modes of evolution (modes called [...] "tychasm", [...] "anancasm", and [...] "agapasm") of the cosmos and its parts. He found his conception of agapasm embodied in Lamarckian evolution; the overall idea in any case is that of evolution tending toward an end or goal, and {{it could also be}} the evolution <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> or a society; {{it is the kind of}} evolution which manifests workings of mind in some general sense. He said that overall he was a synechist, holding with reality of continuity, especially of space, time, and law.|$|E
