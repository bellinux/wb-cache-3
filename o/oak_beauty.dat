50|$|Hypomecis roboraria, {{the great}} <b>oak</b> <b>beauty,</b> is a moth {{of the family}} Geometridae. The species {{can be found in}} Europe.|$|E
50|$|Phaeoura quernaria, the <b>Oak</b> <b>Beauty,</b> is a moth of the Geometridae family. It {{is found}} in eastern North America, {{occurring}} as far west as east-central Alberta. The habitat consists of aspen-cherry shrubland.|$|E
5000|$|B. strataria {{demonstrates}} coincident coloration. [...] A cryptic {{disruptive pattern}} on the wings breaks up the outline, while the coloration blends well with the tree bark on which the <b>oak</b> <b>beauty</b> rests.|$|E
50|$|After some {{experience}} of repertory companies, Munden {{was engaged to}} play old men at Leatherhead. He began to make his mark at Canterbury under the manager Hurst, where in 1780 he was the original Faddle in Mrs. Burgess's comedy, The <b>Oaks,</b> or the <b>Beauties</b> of Canterbury. In the company of Joseph Austin and Charles Edward Whitlock in Chester he held a recognised position, and he toured the country. Munden was then able to borrow money purchase the share of Austin {{in the management of}} northern theatres. Here he played the leading comic business, rising in reputation and fortune.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} let us {{return to the}} little lord himself. Having secured {{the advantage of a}} long start, by the device of turning the key of his chamber, he repaired to the stables, and finding no one to observe him, saddled his pony and galloped away without plan or purpose. An instinctive love of novelty and adventure induced him to direct his course by a road which he had never before pursued; and, after two or three miles progress through a wild open country of brushwood, he found that he had entered that considerable forest which formed the boundary of many of the views from Cadurcis. The afternoon was clear and still, the sun shining in the light blue sky, and the wind altogether hushed. On each side of the winding road spread the bright green turf, occasionally shaded by picturesque groups of doddered <b>oaks.</b> The calm <b>beauty</b> of the sylvan scene wonderfully touched the fancy of the youthful fugitive; it soothed and gratified him. He pulled up his pony; patted its lively neck, as if in gratitude for its good service, and, confident that he could not be successfully pursued, indulged in a thousand dreams of Robin Hood and his merry men. As for his own position and prospects, he gave himself no anxiety about them: satisfied with his escape from a revolting thraldom, his mind seemed to take a bound from the difficulty of his situation and the wildness of the scene, and he felt himself a man, and one, too, whom nothing could daunt or appal.|$|R
50|$|Hypomecis punctinalis, {{the pale}} <b>oak</b> <b>beauty,</b> is a moth {{of the family}} Geometridae. The species {{can be found in}} Central and South Europe, Asia Minor, Transcaucasia, Russia, Russian Far East, Japan, Korea, Ussuri, West China.|$|E
50|$|Dymock Forest is {{important}} for butterflies and moths. The pearl-bordered fritillary and wood white occur {{as well as the}} uncommon white admiral. Other recordings include great <b>oak</b> <b>beauty</b> and satin lutestring. Other scarce moths are associated with particular woodland herbs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>oak</b> <b>beauty</b> {{caterpillar}} is brown, marbled with white, and has {{two small}} red lumps {{on the back of}} its eighth, ninth and twelfth segments and a small lump on the belly on the seventh, eighth and ninth segments. The caterpillar’s head is slightly notched in the middle, possibly due to evolutionary pressures to resemble twigs in appearance.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>oak</b> <b>beauty</b> has white {{forewings}} {{with two}} irregular broad brown bands along each wing. The first band is short, {{located near the}} base of the wing, and surrounded with a black border. The second band is located near the outer margin with a black border surrounding the inner edge. Between these two bands is a white space sprinkled with black dots as well as a crescent-shaped black mark near the middle. The overall appearance gives the <b>oak</b> <b>beauty</b> a mottled look. B. strataria‘s forewings are [...] in diameter, while its wingspan ranges from [...] The oak beauty’s hind wings are paler than its fore wings and have transverse black bands. The forehead and the front of the thorax are white while its sides are a white-grey blend. Its body is covered with many hairs. The back of the thorax and the body are a darker shade of brown.|$|E
5000|$|Biston strataria, the <b>oak</b> <b>beauty,</b> is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae. It is native to Europe, but is {{primarily}} found in the United Kingdom. B. strataria is found {{in a variety of}} habitats, but is mostly found in woodlands where it rests on the bark of trees, camouflaged by its mottled black and grey wings. The male has feather-like antennae while those of the female are more thread-like. The moth has a wingspan of [...]|$|E
50|$|Although the oak beauty’s {{distribution}} {{stretches from}} {{central and southern}} Europe to Asia Minor, the moth is primarily confined to England and Wales and is occasionally spotted in Scotland and Ireland. Within the UK, the <b>oak</b> <b>beauty</b> {{has been found in}} western counties including Crom and Garvary. A few discoveries have been made in Argory and Peatlands in the late 1990s. They have also been rediscovered at Rostrevor Before this time the moth had not been seen since {{the early part of the}} twentieth century and sightings still remain relatively rare.|$|E
50|$|The <b>oak</b> <b>beauty</b> {{exhibits}} melanism {{and comes}} in two different variations; a dark (melanic) form and light (typica) form. The melanic form is prevalent in the Netherlands, but this form has not been observed in Britain. Details explaining this discrepancy are not yet known. The closest relative to B. strataria is the peppered moth (Biston betularia), which also has two forms. The proportion of melanics is higher in B. betularia compared to B. strataria. This is unusual since, between the two species, it is B. strataria that should have a greater evolutionary selection for the prevalence of melanic individuals due to the higher pollution concentrations in the area.|$|E
