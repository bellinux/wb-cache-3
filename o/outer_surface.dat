5|$|Cyathus helenae is {{distinguished}} from the more common C.striatus by its faint inner-surface plication (C.striatus has a more pronounced plication), the nodular arrangement of the hairs on the <b>outer</b> <b>surface,</b> and microscopically by the spore shape – ellipsoid in C.striatus, ovoid or spheroidal in C.helenae.|$|E

30|$|The {{individual}} ZrP {{layer is}} covered with hydroxyl groups extending {{on both sides of}} the monolayer. In pristine ZrP nanoplatelets, these layers are stacked through relatively strong hydrogen bonding, while their <b>outer</b> <b>surfaces</b> are covered with free hydroxyl groups. The most common method to modify layered ZrP nanoplatelets is to use amine molecules such as alkyl amines or polyether amines [34]. The acid-base reaction between amine groups and hydroxyl groups make these amine molecules not only to attach on the <b>outer</b> <b>surfaces</b> of layered ZrP nanoplatelets but also to be able to intercalate in between ZrP layers. Therefore, in order to modify the surface and interlayer of ZrP nanoplatelets differently, a step-by-step modification method should be developed, and a feasible way to achieve this strategy is to modify and protect the <b>outer</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the pristine ZrP nanoplatelets through covalent bonding first, leaving the interlayer untouched for further intercalation.|$|R
5|$|The skin of {{crocodilians}} {{is thick}} and cornified, and is clad in non-overlapping scales known as scutes, arranged in regular rows and patterns. These scales are continually being produced by cell {{division in the}} underlying layer of the epidermis, the stratum germinativum, and the surface of individual scutes sloughs off periodically. The <b>outer</b> <b>surface</b> of the scutes consists of the relatively rigid beta-keratin while the hinge region between the scutes contains only the more pliable alpha-keratin.|$|E
5|$|Wynnea {{americana}} {{is distinguished}} from other {{species in the}} genus Wynnea by the pustules (small bumps) on the <b>outer</b> <b>surface,</b> and microscopically by the large asymmetrical longitudinally ribbed spores with a sharply pointed tip. The spores are made in structures called asci, which have thickened rings at one end that are capped by a hinged structure known as the operculum—a lid that is opened when spores are {{to be released from}} the ascus.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{external}} appearance, Plectania nannfeldtii {{is similar to}} Pseudoplectania vogesiaca. Although this latter species {{may be difficult to}} distinguish by its less hairy external fruit body surface, its microscopic characters identify it more definitively: P.vogesiaca has spores that are much smaller, typically with widths of 12–14µm. Helvella corium is another black cup fungus that appears in the spring; it has smaller spores, whitish margins on the cup edges, and shorter stems than P.nannfeldtii. Pseudoplectania nigrella is smaller, with a hairier <b>outer</b> <b>surface,</b> a darker inner cup surface, and a rudimentary stem.|$|E
40|$|AMS (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry) {{radiocarbon}} {{dates for}} eight potsherds {{from a single}} piece of pottery from a wetland archaeological site indicated that charred material from the inner pottery surfaces (5052 ± 12 BP; N = 5) is about 90 14 C years older than that from the <b>outer</b> <b>surfaces</b> (4961 ± 22 BP; N = 7). We considered three possible causes of this difference: the old wood effect, reservoir effects, and diagenesis. We concluded that differences in the radiocarbon ages between materials from the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the same pot were caused either by the freshwater reservoir effect or by diagenesis. Moreover, we found that the radiocarbon ages of carbonized material on <b>outer</b> <b>surfaces</b> (soot) of pottery from other wetland archaeological sites were the same as the ages of material on inner surfaces (charred food) of the same pot within error, suggesting absence of freshwater reservoir effect or diagenesis...|$|R

5|$|Earth {{has evolved}} through {{geological}} and biological processes that have left {{traces of the}} original conditions. The <b>outer</b> <b>surface</b> is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with {{a thick layer of}} plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Galiella rufa, {{commonly}} known as the rubber cup, the rufous rubber cup, or the hairy rubber cup, is a species of fungus in the family Sarcosomataceae. The fungus produces cup-shaped fruit bodies that typically grow in clusters on branches and exposed portions of buried wood throughout eastern and Midwest North America and in Malaysia. The fruit bodies have the texture of tough, gelatinous rubber, and have a rough, blackish-brown, felt-like <b>outer</b> <b>surface</b> and a smooth reddish-brown inner surface. Although generally considered inedible by North American mushroom field guides, it is commonly consumed in Malaysia. The fungus produces several chemicals with a variety of bioactive properties.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} case, acetic acid reacts with the calcium {{carbonate}} (one {{of the main}} components of freshwater, marine and land shells, birds' eggs and other such specimens) producing calcium acetate, a salt. Formaldehyde can be oxidized by the oxygen in air to create formic acid, which then has basically the same effects as acetic acid, reacting with calcium carbonate to produce a salt. The salts (calcium acetate and calcium formate) crystallize through the specimen's <b>outer</b> <b>surface,</b> destroying its fine detail and exposing more areas for further reaction. As the condition progresses, the salt crystals build up over the specimen's surface, which becomes increasingly eroded.|$|E
