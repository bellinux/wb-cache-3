5|$|Due to {{uncertainty}} <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> object {{would be}} classified as a planet or a minor planet, because different nomenclature procedures apply to these different classes of objects, the decision on what to name the object {{had to wait until}} after the August 24, 2006, IAU ruling. As a result, for a time the object became known to the wider public as Xena.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, the {{congregation}} became divided over {{the need for}} the Jewish community to hire a shochet to ritually slaughter animals for kosher meat, and <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> synagogue should hire a Reform or Conservative rabbi. More traditional members broke away to form the Beth El Congregation, affiliated with Conservative Judaism.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{expiration}} of the NEP in 1990, {{there was much}} debate <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> policy should be renewed, replaced, or scrapped altogether. The government organised an official review of the NEP in the {{years leading up to}} its expiration. The NEP had been faced with a number of criticisms throughout its lifetime, most of them related to political corruption and other inefficiencies.|$|E
5|$|The genus {{attracted}} {{media attention}} in 2000, when a specimen unearthed in 1993 in South Dakota, United States, was interpreted as including a fossilized heart. There was much discussion <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> remains {{were of a}} heart. Many scientists now doubt {{the identification of the}} object and the implications of such an identification.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{attempts}} were made to locate the remains of Yagan's body, which were believed to be on Lot 39 West Swan Road in the outer Perth suburb of Belhus. A remote sensing survey of the site was carried out in 1998, but no remains were found. An archaeological survey of the area was undertaken two years later, but this also was unsuccessful. Disputes then arose <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> head could be buried separately from the body. Wilkes has claimed that it can, so long as it is placed where Yagan was killed, so that Dreamtime spirits can reunite the remains.|$|E
5|$|Examples {{of common}} human {{diseases}} caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox, and cold sores. Many serious {{diseases such as}} Ebola virus disease, AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is {{described in terms of}} virulence. Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome. There is controversy <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.|$|E

However, he recovered to play four further Premier League matches. Portsmouth were relegated in 20th position {{at the end of the}} season, having been deducted nine points for entering into administration. Despite uncertainty <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> club would be able to continue as a business, Smith remained at the club. He started their first match of the 2010–11 season on 7 August 2010, a match in which Portsmouth were only able to name four of their permitted seven substitutes.|$|E

5|$|Humans have {{inhabited}} the Columbia's watershed {{for more than}} 15,000years, with a transition to a sedentary lifestyle based mainly on salmon starting about 3,500years ago. In 1962, archaeologists found evidence of human activity dating back 11,230years at the Marmes Rockshelter, near {{the confluence of the}} Palouse and Snake rivers in eastern Washington. In 1996 the skeletal remains of a 9,000-year-old prehistoric man (dubbed Kennewick Man) were found near Kennewick, Washington. The discovery rekindled debate in the scientific community over the origins of human habitation in North America and sparked a protracted controversy <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> scientific or Native American community was entitled to possess and/or study the remains.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006 it was {{announced}} that the festival was in financial crisis and there was uncertainty <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> 2007 event would take place. The festival planning went ahead with support and donations from a number of Bristol businesses. In June 2007 it {{was announced}} that alcohol {{would not be allowed to}} be taken on site, but would be available to purchase from official bars within the arena. Also, that everyone attending the festival would be searched on the way in. This announcement caused much controversy.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, {{after months}} of public tensions, Bonamassa {{announced}} that he was no longer a member of Black Country Communion, with the question <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> group would continue with another guitarist unclear. Days later, Hughes confirmed that the band was officially over, hinting that he would continue working with Bonham and Sherinian under a new collective name. Sherinian later joined Bonamassa's touring band, while Hughes and Bonham formed California Breed with guitarist Andrew Watt. Hughes and Bonamassa later reconciled and the band reunited in 2016, with fourth album BCCIV released in September 2017.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{grouping}} {{of several of}} the highland terriers (including the Scottie) under the generic name Skye Terriers caused some confusion in the breed’s lineage. There is disagreement <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Skye Terriers mentioned in early 16th century records actually descended from forerunners of the Scottie or vice versa. It is certain, however, that Scotties and West Highland White Terriers are closely related—both their forefathers originated from the Blackmount region of Perthshire and the Moor of Rannoch. Scotties were originally bred to hunt and kill vermin on farms and to hunt badgers and foxes in the Highlands of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|James E. Boyd, who {{had assumed}} the vice chancellorship of the University System of Georgia the {{previous}} month, was appointed Acting President of Georgia Tech by Chancellor George L. Simpson in May 1971. Simpson's selection of Boyd as interim president {{was influenced by}} Boyd's previous experience as an academic administrator, his experience {{as director of the}} Engineering Experiment Station, and his ongoing position on the station's board of directors. The chancellor hoped this combination would help resolve a brewing controversy <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> EES should be integrated into Georgia Tech's academic units to improve both entities' competitiveness for federal money.|$|E
5|$|Moltke and Goeben, {{improvements}} {{over the}} preceding Von der Tann, were ordered in 1908 and 1909, respectively. While their design {{was not as}} contentious as with the Von der Tann, there were still disagreements between Tirpitz and the General Navy Department <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> main battery guns should be increased in number or caliber. Tirpitz favored the increase to ten guns, while the Navy Department preferred eight 30.5cm (12in) guns. It was eventually decided that ten 28cm guns would be mounted. In addition to the increased main battery, the two Moltke-class ships were slightly larger and better armored than Von der Tann.|$|E
50|$|The WCC {{was split}} <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> to accept <b>the</b> two new members: the party leader {{supported}} accepting them, while the party president was opposed. After a few months, Sveinson and Hampton were {{expelled from the}} party.|$|R

5|$|On an {{examining}} table, {{one of the}} kidnappers, Eric Swan (James Marsters), strips Taylor, harshly washes {{her with}} a course brush, and photographs her. The picture is sent to Watts, who is seen looking at it while supervising the crime scene. Black is also at the scene, and experiences a vision of Operation Desert Storm. Evidence is found of military-style tyre and boot tracks; these lead the FBI to an address where they find the second kidnapper murdered—Black and Watts clash <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Group or Swan are responsible. Back in the examination room, Swan exposes Taylor to a substance contained in a canister.|$|E
5|$|Other legal {{troubles}} {{were left}} over in {{wake of the}} expansion collapse. Louisiana courts eventually ordered the Gliebermans to repay Shreveport US$1 million with interest; the dispute centered <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> city had agreed to share losses or simply lent money to the ownership group. Art Williams, enraged after discovering some American owners had received discounts and extended payment periods on their franchise fees, threatened litigation and at first refused to honour the balance of Matt Dunigan's sizable contract before the matter was dragged through court.|$|E
5|$|When Singapore {{joined the}} Federation of Malaya in 1963, the Malayan ISA was {{extended}} to Singapore. The Act was retained in Singapore even after its separation from Malaysia in 1965. The current version of the Act is known as Chapter 143 of the 1985 Revised Edition. In September 2011, the debate <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> ISA should be retained was re-opened after Malaysia {{announced that it was}} considering repealing the ISA. Prime Minister Najib Razak stated that the Act would be abolished and replaced by new laws to safeguard peace and order.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{original}} sections of 1 Esdras describes a debate among three courtiers of Darius I of Persia <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> wine, <b>the</b> king, or women (but above all the truth) is the strongest.

25|$|Historically, {{there has}} been much debate <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> Peter was <b>the</b> real {{initiator}} of the Crusade as opposed to Pope Urban II. The expedition's independence has been used by some historians such as Hagenmeyer to prove this.|$|R
