50|$|Knight Vinke {{has been}} an {{institutional}} investor in Eni for over 5 years and since 2009 has been calling for the state-controlled Italian oil and gas group to break itself up. It has argued that Eni's ownership of the gas pipeline operator Snam left both with the wrong capital structure; Eni was <b>overgeared</b> for an exploration and production company, while Snam, as a regulated utility, was undergeared.|$|E
5000|$|At Glen Helen on lap 2, {{the lead}} for John Holden/Andrew Winkle was now reduced to 0.19 seconds. Due to the {{increasing}} race speed of Nick Crowe/Mark Crowe and problems experienced by John Holden/Andrew Winkle with a failing rear shock absorber they slipped 4.19 seconds behind the new leaders of Crowe/Cox at Ramsey Hairpin on lap 2. The Yamaha sidecar of Steve Norbury/Rick Long retired at Handley's Corner on lap 2 allowing Simon Neary/Jamie Winn to claim 3rd place and to lead the 600cc LCR Suzuki of Tim Reeves/Patrick Farrance by just 0.23 seconds in 4th place. A lap of 19 minutes, 40.43 seconds an average race speed of 115.066 mph on lap 2 by Nick Crowe/Mark Cox was the fastest of the race and now led John Holden/Andrew Winkle by 9.8 seconds. This lead increased to 12 seconds by Glen Helen on lap 3 for Crowe/Cox and the Yamaha sidecar of Simon Neary/Jamie Winn retired at Union Mills allowing TT newcomer Tim Reeves/Patrick Farrance into 3rd place. On the final climb of the Mountain Section, Nick Crowe/Mark Cox extended their lead to 16.49 seconds to win Sidecar TT Race 'A' in 59 minutes and 22.80 seconds at an average race speed of 114.372 mph from John Holden/Andrew Winkle in 2nd place at an average race speed of 113.751 mph and the former World Sidecar Champion Tim Reeves/Patrick Farrance in 3rd place at an average race speed of 111.096 mph. Despite the fast race pace, Nick Crowe commented that;- [...] "The bike did not feel very fast today....It wouldn't pull top gear properly. I may have <b>overgeared</b> it, but {{perhaps it was the}} heat.". The 3rd place for Tim Reeves was the first podium place for a sidecar driver as a TT newcomer since Rolf Biland and Ken Williams finished 2nd in the 1977 Sidecar Race 'B.' In respect to his decision to enter the Isle of Man TT Races, Tim Reeves had some harsh comments;- [...] "I had some many doubters. So many said I wouldn't cut it here so this has just pi**ed in their Corn Flakes." ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the use of}} {{a number}} of mistblowers for the orchard and {{vineyard}} protection, the overgear-box, located between the p. t. o. and the centrifugal fan, was damaged. To solve the problem we carried-out a dynamic analysis of initial no steady-state by integrating the differential equation of the impeller motion. By the obtained equations, a numerical experimentation was carried-out. It showed the gearing of a power greater than design power of the <b>overgear</b> box, due to impeller inertia. This result explains the <b>overgear</b> box damages and gave the no steady-state condition time (1, 8 s), to get the rated velocity of the impeller. Finally a torque limiter assembling, between the p. t. o. and the <b>overgear</b> box, was proposed. A new differential equation solution and a new numerical experimentation was carried-out. It showed a reduction of the geared power to the rated value of the overgearbox, together with an increase of the no steady-state condition time to 8, 7 s...|$|R
50|$|In July 1979 the car {{underwent}} another styling modification, receiving {{large black}} plastic cladding on the rear, surrounding new taillights, and new side trim and bumpers. The grille was also new, {{and there was}} black plastic wheelarches to link all of the plastic parts together. The extractor vents behind the rear side windows were also larger, of black plastic, and wrapped around the pillar. In terms of transmissions, a five-speed transmission now became available on certain models. The fifth gear was an <b>overgear,</b> while the ratios of the four lower speeds and the final gearing remained unchanged. The front turn signals were moved {{from the front of}} the fenders to a spot just in front of the leading edge of the doors, while a small badge denoting the trim level appeared in the turn signal's old place.|$|R
