40|$|Nitinol stent <b>oversizing</b> is {{frequently}} performed in peripheral arteries {{to ensure a}} desirable lumen gain. However, the clinical effect of mis-sizing remains controversial. The goal {{of this study was}} to provide a better understanding of the structural and hemodynamic effects of Nitinol stent <b>oversizing.</b> Five patient-specific numerical models of non-calcified popliteal arteries were developed to simulate the deployment of Nitinol stents with <b>oversizing</b> ratios ranging from 1. 1 to 1. 8. In addition to arterial biomechanics, computational fluid dynamics methods were adopted to simulate the physiological blood flow inside the stented arteries. Results showed that stent <b>oversizing</b> led to a limited increase in the acute lumen gain, albeit at the cost of a significant increase in arterial wall stresses. Furthermore, localized areas affected by low Wall Shear Stress increased with higher <b>oversizing</b> ratios. Stents were also negatively impacted by the procedure as their fatigue safety factors gradually decreased with <b>oversizing.</b> These adverse effects to both the artery walls and stents may create circumstances for restenosis. Although the ideal <b>oversizing</b> ratio is stent-specific, this study showed that Nitinol stent <b>oversizing</b> has a very small impact on the immediate lumen gain, which contradicts the clinical motivations of the procedure.

Extensive {{work has been done}} to establish the role of MDCT in aortic annular sizing with Edward Sapiens transcatheter heart valves (THV) [11, 26, 46]. While exaggerated <b>oversizing</b> of the THV and excessive calcification of the native aortic valve can result in aortic annular rupture, some THV <b>oversizing</b> is required for both types of THV to prevent PAR. For the CoreValve device the recommended device/annulus <b>oversizing</b> is 15  % of the aortic basal ring perimeter. For the Edwards Sapiens valve, the recommended device/annulus <b>oversizing</b> is 15 – 25  % of the area and 7 – 12  % of the mean diameter. This degree of <b>oversizing</b> of the THV appears to provide the best risk-benefit ratio in terms of PAR reduction and conduction disorders [57, 58]. Undersizing of the THV can lead to increased PAR and greater likelihood of valve ‘pop-out’ or migration [10, 59].|$|E

40|$|PurposeThe role of {{endovascular}} graft <b>oversizing</b> on risk of distal graft migration following endovascular aneurysm repair for abdominal {{aortic aneurysm}} is poorly understood. A controlled in vitro {{investigation of the}} role of <b>oversizing</b> in graft-aorta attachment strength for endovascular grafts (EVGs) with barbs was performed. MethodsBarbed stent grafts (N = 20) with controlled graft <b>oversizing</b> varying from 4 - 45 % were fabricated while maintaining other design variables unchanged. A flow loop with physiological flow characteristics and a biosynthetic aortic aneurysm phantom (synthetic aneurysm model with a bovine aortic neck) were developed. The stent grafts were deployed into the aortic neck of the bio-synthetic aortic aneurysm phantom under realistic flow conditions. Computed tomography imaging of the graft-aorta complex was used to document attachment characteristics such as graft apposition, number of barbs penetrated, and penetration depth and angle. The strength of graft attachment to the aortic neck was assessed using mechanical pullout testing. Stent grafts were categorized into four groups based on oversizing: 4 - 10 %; 11 - 20 %; 21 - 30 %; and greater than 30 % <b>oversizing.</b> ResultsPullout force, a measure of post-deployment fixation strength was not different between 4 - 10 % (6. 23 ± 1. 90 N), 11 - 20 % (6. 25 ± 1. 84 N) and 20 - 30 % (5. 85 ± 1. 89 N) groups, but significantly lower for the group with greater than 30 % <b>oversizing</b> (3. 67 ± 1. 41 N). Increasing <b>oversizing</b> caused a proportional {{decrease in the number of}} barbs penetrating the aortic wall (correlation = − 0. 83). Of the 14 barbs available in the stent graft, 89 % of the barbs (12. 5 of 14 on average) penetrated the aortic wall in the 4 - 10 % <b>oversizing</b> group while only 38 % (5. 25 of 14) did for the greater than 30 % group (P <. 001). Also, the stent grafts with greater than 30 % <b>oversizing</b> showed significantly poorer apposition characteristics such as eccentric compression or folding of the graft perimeter. The number and depth of barb penetration were found to be positively correlated to pullout force. ConclusionGreater than 30 % graft <b>oversizing</b> affects both barb penetration and graft apposition adversely resulting in a low pullout force in this in vitro model. Barbed stent grafts with excessive <b>oversizing</b> are likely to result in poor fixation and increased risk of migration. Clinical RelevanceMigration of the endovascular grafts in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients continues to be a cause of long-term complication in patients.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundGenerous endograft <b>oversizing</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with propensity for aortic neck dilation and subsequent device migration in endografts without suprarenal fixation. Effects of variable <b>oversizing</b> of endografts with suprarenal fixation have been poorly studied. MethodsThree hundred fifty-one patients underwent endovascular AAA repair (EVAR) in a prospective multicenter trial using the Zenith AAA Endovascular Graft, a fully supported bifurcated 3 -piece endograft with barb-enhanced suprarenal stent fixation. Blinded core-laboratory measurement of variables was prospectively recorded at predischarge and at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months after the procedure. Potential influence of endograft <b>oversizing</b> on subsequent aortic neck dilation (minor axis), aneurysm shrinkage (major axis), device migration, endoleak, rupture, open conversion, and death were retrospectively studied. Data are given as mean ± SEM. ResultsRisk of endograft migration (> 5 mm) at 12 months was 2. 3 % (6 / 261). However, patients with endograft <b>oversizing</b> of > 30 % had a 14 % (4 / 29) migration risk compared with those oversized ≤ 30 % (0. 9 %, 2 / 232), P 10 mm or clinical event). Device <b>oversizing</b> > 30 % was associated with decreased AAA sac shrinkage (48 % vs 77 %) and with increased sac enlargement (9. 5 % vs 0. 6 %) at 24 months when compared with <b>oversizing</b> of ≤ 30 %, respectively (P =. 001). Incidence rate of any endoleak at 12 and 24 months was 8. 2 % (21 / 256) and 7. 1 % (12 / 169), respectively. <b>Oversizing</b> of endografts by > 30 % was associated with an increased type II endoleak rate (11 vs 4. 7 %) that failed to reach statistical significance (P =. 27). Aortic neck diameters increased significantly by 6 months (P 30 % was associated with an ∼ 14 -fold increase in device migration (> 5 mm) at 12 months and with a ∼ 16 -fold increased risk of AAA expansion at 24 months.

BackgroundCT has emerged as an alternative to 2 -dimensional TEE for THV sizing. MethodsIn our early experience, TEE-derived aortic annular diameters determined THV size selection. CT datasets originally obtained for vascular screening were retrospectively interrogated to determine CT-derived annular diameters. Annular dimensions and expected THV <b>oversizing</b> were compared between TEE and CT. The incidence of PVL was correlated to TEE- and CT-based <b>oversizing</b> calculations. ResultsUsing TEE-derived annulus measurements, 157 patients underwent CoreValve implantation (23 mm: n = 66; 29 mm: n = 91). The estimated THV <b>oversizing</b> on the basis of TEE was 20. 1 ± 8. 2 %. Retrospective CT analysis yielded larger annular diameters than TEE (p < 0. 0001). When these CT diameters were used to recalculate the percentage of <b>oversizing</b> achieved with the TEE-selected CoreValve, the actual THV <b>oversizing</b> was only 10. 4 ± 7. 8 %. Consequently, CT analysis suggested that up to 50 % of patients received an inappropriate CoreValve size. When CT-based sizing criteria were satisfied, the incidence of PVL was 21 % lower than that with echocardiography (14 % vs. 35 %; p =  0. 003). Adherence to CT-based <b>oversizing</b> was independently associated with a reduced incidence of PVL (odds ratio 0. 36; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 14 to 0. 90; p = 0. 029); adherence to TEE-based sizing was not. ConclusionsRetrospective CT-based annular analysis revealed that CoreValve size selection by TEE was incorrect in 50 % of patients. The percentage of <b>oversizing</b> with CT was one-half of that calculated with TEE resulting in the majority of patients receiving a THV that was too small...|$|E

BackgroundThe inverse relationship of PAR occurrence and <b>oversizing</b> has been demonstrated for the Sapien XT but the incidence of PAR with comparable <b>oversizing</b> with the Sapien 3 is not known. MethodsSixty-one prospectively enrolled patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the Sapien 3 THV were compared with 92 patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the Sapien XT THV. Patients were categorized depending on the degree of MDCT area <b>oversizing</b> percentage: undersizing (below 0 %), 0 % to 5 %, 5 % to 10 %, and above 10 %. The primary endpoint was mild or greater PAR on transthoracic echocardiography. ResultsMild or greater PAR was present in 19. 7 % of patients (12 of 61) in the Sapien 3 group and in 54. 3 % of patients (50 of 92) in the Sapien XT group (p  10 % (p for interaction = 0. 54). Moderate or severe PAR rates were also lower in the Sapien 3 group than in the Sapien XT group (3. 3 % vs. 13. 0 %, p = 0. 04). In the Sapien 3 group, a MDCT area <b>oversizing</b> percentage value of ≤ 4. 17 % was identified as the optimal cutoff value to discriminate patients with or without mild or greater PAR. ConclusionsOur retrospective analysis suggests that the Sapien 3 THV displays significantly lower rates of PAR than does the Sapien XT THV.

Endograft folding will then be assessed on its role in endograft fixation strength. Methods: Bench top flow loop experiments were performed with barbless Gore Excluder endovascular grafts (EVG) that were deployed into silicone aorta-AAA models with neck angles of 0, 30, and 60. A total of five oversizings were tested: - 7 %, 2 %, 12 %, 24 %, and 38 % with N= 3 for each <b>oversizing</b> at each neck angle {{for a total of}} 45 experiments.

We compared different level of <b>oversizing</b> in our cohort of con- secutive patients to address if severe <b>oversizing</b> compared to normal sizing {{had an impact on}} post-procedural outcomes. Methods From January 2010 to August 2013, consecutive patients were referred for TAVI with preoperative Multislice-CT (MSCT) and the procedures were achieved using Edwards Sapien® or Corevalve devices®. Retrospectively, according to pre-procedural MSCT and the valve size, pa- tients were classified into three groups: normal, moderate and severe oversizing; depending on the ratio between the prosthesis area and the annulus area indexed and measured on MSCT. Main endpoint was mid-term mortality and secondary endpoints were the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC- 2) endpoints. Results Two hundred and sixty eight patients had a MSCT and underwent TAVI procedure, with mainly Corevalve®. While all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates were similar in all groups, post-procedural new pacemaker (PM) implantation rate was significantly higher in the severe <b>oversizing</b> group (P = 0. 03), while we observed more in-hospital congestive heart-failure (P = 0. 02) in the normal sizing group. There was a trend toward more moderate to severe aortic regurgitation (AR) in the normal sizing group (P = 0. 07).

BackgroundCA and PPIs are frequent complications after transcatheter aortic valve replacement with a next-generation balloon-expandable transcatheter heart valve (SAPIEN 3). The potential underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. MethodsOf 244 patients treated with SAPIEN 3, 208 without a previous pacemaker and 184 without baseline CA were analyzed. We assessed the association of angiographic implantation depth (% of frame height below the annulus) and degree of <b>oversizing</b> with PPI and CA. ResultsNew PPI and new or worsened CA or PPI occurred in 16 % (34 of 208) and 31 % (57 of 184), respectively. Patients requiring PPI had a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (44 % vs. 24 %; p = 0. 017), complete right bundle branch block (27 % vs. 5 %; p = 0. 001), and bradycardia (< 60 beats/min, 38 % vs. 21 %; p = 0. 034). In patients with new CA or PPI, implantation depth was lower (at septal side: 29 ± 8 % vs. 25 ± 7 %; p = 0. 003), and rate of <b>oversizing</b> was higher (19 % [11 of 57] vs. 6 % [8 of 126]; p = 0. 007). Independent predictors of new or worsened CA or PPI were implantation depth at septal side (odds ratio [OR]: 1. 063 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 017 to 1. 110]; p = 0. 006 per % of frame below the aortic annulus), <b>oversizing</b> (OR: 3. 489 [95 % CI: 1. 236 to 9. 848]; p = 0. 018), and QRS duration (OR:  1. 033 [95 % CI: 1. 011 to 1. 056]; p = 0. 003 per ms).
