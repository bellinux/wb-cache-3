5|$|The K–Pg {{extinction}} had {{a profound}} effect on the evolution <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> Earth. The elimination of dominant Cretaceous groups allowed other organisms to take their place, spurring a remarkable series of adaptive radiations in the Paleogene. The most striking example is the replacement of dinosaurs by mammals. After the K–Pg extinction, mammals evolved rapidly to fill the niches left vacant by the dinosaurs. Also significant, within the mammalian genera, new species were approximately 9.1% larger after the K–Pg boundary.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of extraterrestrial intelligence would have various impacts on biology and astrobiology.
