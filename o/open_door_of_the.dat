500|$|In the mid-1930s Knight befriended {{and painted}} groups of Gypsies at the Epsom and Ascot racecourses. Knight {{frequently}} {{returned to the}} racecourses and painted {{from the back of}} an antique Rolls-Royce car, which was large enough to accommodate her easel. Often pairs of Gypsy women would pose at the <b>open</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rolls-Royce, with the race-day crowds in the background. From Epsom Knight was invited to the Gypsy settlement at Iver in Buckinghamshire. Knight visited the Iver settlement, normally closed to outsiders, every day for several [...] months in the late 1930s. These visits resulted in a series of portraits of great intensity. Two women, in particular, sat a number of times for Knight, Lilo Smith, the subject of Old Gypsy Women (1938) and Gypsy Splendour (1939), and her daughter-in-law, Beulah. Gypsy Splendour was shown at the Royal Academy in 1939, the year Lilo Smith died.|$|E

60|$|The next {{sound was}} <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> women-servants' voices. Two {{of them came}} up to put the sheets on the beds in Number Three and Number Four. The women were in high good-humor, {{laughing}} and {{talking to each other}} through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rooms. The master's customers were coming in at last, they said, with a vengeance; the house would soon begin to look cheerful, if things went on like this.|$|R
30|$|We <b>open</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{train at}} every station. I {{must have done}} it {{thousands}} <b>of</b> times. <b>The</b> only difference during security procedures is that the <b>door</b> is <b>opened</b> {{not only for the}} passengers, but also for the station team to get on the train to remove the suspicious item.|$|R
60|$|The old woman's eyes became intelligent, {{and turned}} {{with a quick}} look towards the <b>open</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church, and thence towards the choir.|$|E

60|$|Losing no time, {{for they}} had now passed several rods beyond the road-house, the plucky boy wriggled his body toward the <b>open</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coach.|$|E
60|$|At the <b>open</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} Neale met Baxter face to face, {{and that}} worthy's greeting left Neale breathless and aghast, yet thrilling with sheer gladness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Huh!" [...] A scornful exclamation. Then {{she glanced}} at the <b>open</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dining-hall and laying aside her work she rose with a {{determined}} air and said: ...|$|E
60|$|Presently Kep <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shed, {{and let out}} Jemima Puddle-duck.|$|R

60|$|Major Thomson seemed for {{a moment}} deaf. He was looking through the <b>open</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smoking-room to where Sir Alfred was deep {{in the pages of}} a review.|$|E
60|$|Miss Macy {{had heard}} {{a step in the}} passage. It halted at last, half irresolutely, before the <b>open</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kitchen, and the {{stranger}} appeared with an embarrassed air.|$|E
60|$|He <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner {{room for}} Betty, and {{followed}} her in.|$|R
60|$|He threw <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sitting-room and {{switched}} on the electric light.|$|R
60|$|Braile {{turned back}} and <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room where Dylks was lurking.|$|R
6000|$|Through the ample <b>open</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{peaceful}} country barn, [...] A sunlit pasture {{field with}} cattle and horses feeding, [...] And haze and vista, {{and the far}} horizon fading away.|$|E
60|$|The last {{thought made}} one wave with the impulse that sent Rex walking firmly {{into the house}} and through the <b>open</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study, where he saw his father packing a traveling-desk.|$|E
60|$|The Dean {{came out}} to the little gate in the dark,--you could see the lamplight behind him from the <b>open</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rectory,--and he shook hands with Mullins and they went in together.|$|E

6000|$|... "Did you {{see when}} the fellow came into church?" [...] asked the indignant Colonel Wolfe. [...] "He came in at the <b>open</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common, just in time, and as the psalm was over." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{raised the}} pistol, and then, {{with a quick}} sudden intaking of the breath, he dropped it, and knelt with glaring eyes looking up at a tree which faced the <b>open</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hut.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look!" [...] exclaimed Fred, {{pointing}} {{in through the}} <b>open</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restaurant. [...] "There are those same men who were at our hotel. Evidently they can't be stopping there--or at least they don't eat there." ...|$|E
60|$|Ned gave {{a little}} nod, and, taking his brother's hand, <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parlor.|$|R
