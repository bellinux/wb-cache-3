40|$|SummaryThe {{ability of}} dietary {{restriction}} to increase animal life span is often thought to arise from differential {{allocation of resources}} between somatic investment and reproduction [1 – 4]. In this theory, reproduction is repressed upon dietary restriction to make scarce nutrients available to somatic functions that increase survival. Here, we label nitrogen and carbon in the dietary yeast of Drosophila melanogaster with stable isotopes to determine whether resources are invested to somatic tissues {{at the expense of}} reproduction. We find that females <b>on</b> <b>a</b> full <b>diet</b> acquire and allocate more dietary carbon, nitrogen and essential amino acids (EAA) to eggs than females <b>on</b> <b>a</b> restricted <b>diet.</b> Full-diet females also invest more carbon, nitrogen and EAA into somatic tissue than those <b>on</b> <b>a</b> restricted <b>diet.</b> Thus, the longer lifespan of flies <b>on</b> <b>a</b> restricted <b>diet</b> relative to those <b>on</b> <b>a</b> full <b>diet</b> cannot be explained by greater absolute somatic investment, and high somatic investment does not ensure longevity. We find, however, that resource allocation to somatic tissue relative to investment to eggs is greatest in females <b>on</b> <b>a</b> restricted <b>diet.</b> To account for these patterns we propose that dietary restriction in Drosophila may extend lifespan through somatic investment relative to damage incurred from reproduction [5]...|$|R

Many species of cockroach harbor symbiotic protozoans and bacteria in their gut which are able to digest cellulose. In many species, these symbionts may be essential if the insect is to utilize cellulose; however, some species secrete cellulase in their saliva, and the wood-eating cockroach, Panesthia cribrata, is able to survive indefinitely <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>diet</b> of crystallized cellulose while being free of micro-organisms.|$|E

5|$|Cats {{conserve}} heat {{by reducing}} {{the flow of blood}} to their skin and lose heat by evaporation through their mouths. Cats have minimal ability to sweat, with glands located primarily in their paw pads, and pant for heat relief only at very high temperatures (but may also pant when stressed). A cat's body temperature does not vary throughout the day; this is part of cats' general lack of circadian rhythms and may reflect their tendency to be active both during the day and at night. Cats' feces are comparatively dry and their urine is highly concentrated, both of which are adaptations to allow cats to retain as much water as possible. Their kidneys are so efficient, they can survive <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>diet</b> consisting only of meat, with no additional water, and can even rehydrate by drinking seawater. While domestic cats are able to swim, they are generally reluctant to enter water as it quickly leads to exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|In North America {{and most}} of Europe, voles predominate in the diet and shrews are {{the second most common}} food choice. Mice and rats form the main {{foodstuffs}} in the Mediterranean region, the tropics, sub-tropics and Australia. Barn owls are usually more specialist feeders in productive areas and generalists in drier areas. On the Cape Verde Islands, geckos are the mainstay of the diet, supplemented by birds such as plovers, godwits, turnstones, weavers and pratincoles, and on a rocky islet off the coast of California, a clutch of four young were being reared <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>diet</b> of Leach's storm petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa). In Ireland, the accidental introduction of the bank vole in the 1950s led to a major shift in the barn owl's diet: where their ranges overlap, the vole is now by far the largest prey item. Locally superabundant rodent species in the weight class of several grams per individual usually make up the single largest proportion of prey. In the United States, rodents and other small mammals usually make up ninety-five percent of the diet and worldwide, over ninety percent of the prey caught.|$|E

40|$|Glitazones induce {{peripheral}} edema {{through an}} unknown mechanism {{in up to}} 20 % of cases. This study examines the effects of pioglitazone (PIO) on renal sodium handling and renal hemodynamics in healthy male volunteers (HV) exposed to a high (HS) and low (LS) sodium diet. The influence of PIO on plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was examined. Nine HV aged 22 - 28 y were enrolled. BMI, blood pressure and glucose tolerance were normal. The study had a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, twofold cross-over design. Each subject received either PIO 45 mg qd or placebo qd, for 6 weeks, with 2 weeks wash-out. From weeks 1 - 4, subjects were on their usual diet. During weeks 5 and 6, subjects were either <b>on</b> <b>a</b> LS or <b>a</b> HS <b>diet</b> for <b>a</b> week which was followed by ambulatory blood pressure measurements, hormonal measurements and renal function studies. The differences between PIO and placebo effects were examined (median, range among all subjects). No subject developed edema. Insulin sensitivity, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow or filtration fraction did not change significantly with PIO. Weight increased with PIO in 7 / 9 subjects while <b>on</b> <b>a</b> LS <b>diet</b> (0. 7 kg; - 1 - 2. 9) and in 6 / 9 while <b>on</b> <b>a</b> HS <b>diet</b> (1. 1 kg; - 1. 5 - 3. 4). Median sodium (Na) excretion with placebo was of 21. 2 mmol/ 24 h and 239. 7 mmol/ 24 h respectively while <b>on</b> <b>a</b> LS and HS diet. Urinary Na excretion decreased with PIO in 6 / 9 subjects <b>on</b> <b>a</b> LS <b>diet</b> (- 12. 2 mmol/ 24 h; - 21 - 8. 7, p= 0. 05), and in 5 / 9 subjects <b>on</b> <b>a</b> HS <b>diet</b> (- 30 mmol/ 24 h; - 344 - 69). Na clearance decreased in 6 / 9 subjects <b>on</b> <b>a</b> LS <b>diet</b> (- 0. 05 ml/min; - 0. 11 - 0. 05) and in 6 / 9 subjects <b>on</b> <b>a</b> HS <b>diet</b> (- 0. 15 mmol/ml; - 2. 7 - 0. 4). Na clearance at the proximal level decreased with PIO in 8 / 9 subjects <b>on</b> <b>a</b> LS <b>diet</b> (- 4. 9 ml/min; - 14. 4 - 1. 5, p= 0. 01) and in 5 / 9 subjects <b>on</b> <b>a</b> HS <b>diet</b> (- 2 ml/min; - 43 - 8. 5). PRA increased with PIO in 8 / 9 subjects <b>on</b> <b>a</b> LS <b>diet</b> (0. 16 ng/ml/h; - 0. 07 - 0. 8, p= 0. 02) and <b>on</b> <b>a</b> HS <b>diet</b> (0. 09 ng/ml/h; - 0. 1 - 0. 21, p= 0. 03).

5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} over the warmer months with eggs laid from August to January. The clutch is laid {{on a bed of}} wood dust or leaves and {{consists}} of two to five (or rarely up to eight) round or oval glossy white eggs, each of which is generally 21 to 22mm long by 18mm (0.8 by 0.7in) wide. Clutches tend to have more eggs in earlier rather than later clutches, and in nests located further from cleared land. Eggs are laid at an interval of two to three days. Incubation takes 18 to 21 days. The female incubates the eggs and broods the young, and feeds them for their first few days before the male begins helping. She leaves to feed and drink twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Both parents take part in feeding the young, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>diet</b> predominantly of seeds with some fruit. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born helpless and blind and remain in the nest for an extended period. Covered in silvery-white down, they have pink skin and darker blue-grey skin around the eye. By seven days they open their eyes, and are well-covered in grey down with pin feathers emerging from their wings on day six. They are almost covered in feathers by day 21, and fledge (leave the nest) at around 23days of age in the wild and up to 30days of age in captivity.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—To {{study the}} effects of {{modestly}} increased expression of aldosterone synthase (AS), we generated mice (AShi/hi) by replacing the 3 untranslated region of AS mRNA with that from a stable mRNA. AShi/hi mice <b>on</b> <b>a</b> normal-salt <b>diet</b> had 1. 5 times the wild-type AS mRNA in adrenals, although their blood pressure and plasma aldosterone did not differ from wild-type mice. Changes in dietary salt did not affect the blood pressure of wild-type mice, but AShi/hi mice had 10 -mm Hg higher blood pressure <b>on</b> <b>a</b> high-salt <b>diet</b> than <b>on</b> <b>a</b> low-salt <b>diet</b> and than wild-type mice on either diet. The AShi/hi mice <b>on</b> <b>a</b> high-salt <b>diet</b> also had higher plasma aldosterone, lower plasma potassium, and greater renal expression of the subunit of epithelial sodium channel compared with wild-type mice. The AShi/hi mice <b>on</b> <b>a</b> high-salt <b>diet</b> also had more water intake and urine volume and less urine osmolality than wild-type mice. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> low-salt <b>diet,</b> AShi/hi mice maintained normal blood pressure with less activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system than wild-type mice. The AShi/hi mice also had less water intake and urine volume and higher urine osmolality than wild-type mice. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> medium high-salt <b>diet,</b> AShi/hi mice were more susceptible than wild-type mice to infusion of angiotensin II, having a higher blood pressure, greater cardiac hypertrophy, and increased oxidative stress.
