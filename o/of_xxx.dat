5|$|The 7th Armoured Division and the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division {{were the}} {{follow-up}} divisions <b>of</b> <b>XXX</b> Corps. The 22nd Armoured Brigade (the armoured {{component of the}} 7th Armoured Division) was scheduled to land during the evening of 6 June, but it was unable to land until the next day. The bulk of the division landed from 9–10 June, with some elements landing later. The 49th Division came ashore on 12 June.|$|E
5|$|In the 9 days {{of battle}} almost 2000 Allied {{soldiers}} were killed (some of whom died of their wounds or in captivity after the battle). These included over 1174 men of the British 1st Airborne Division, 219 men of the Glider Pilot Regiment, 92 men of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade, 368 men of the RAF, 79 re-supply dispatchers of the RASC, 25 men <b>of</b> <b>XXX</b> Corps and 27 men of US IX Troop Carrier Command. The exact number of German dead is unknown, but {{is believed to be}} at least 1300. Additionally it is believed 453 Dutch civilians were killed during the battle.|$|E
5|$|Overnight, the Germans {{south of}} the river formed a {{blocking}} line along the railway, linking up with 10th SS {{to the south and}} screening the road bridge from the Poles. The Polish were well dug in at Driel, however, and German armour was unable to manoeuvre off of the main roads to attack them. Hopes were raised when three armoured cars <b>of</b> <b>XXX</b> Corps' Household Cavalry managed to skirt the German defences on the island and link up with Sosabowski's force. These were followed after dark by tanks of the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards and infantry of the 5th Battalion Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry. Behind them, the rest of the 43rd Wessex Division was making its way up a narrow corridor.|$|E

5|$|South of {{the river}} Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks, {{commander}} <b>of</b> <b>XXX</b> Corps and Lieutenant-General Frederick Browning of I Airborne Corps, decided not to reinforce the position north of the Rhine. Instead they ordered the Corps staff to prepare a plan to withdraw the division (Operation Berlin). The evacuation of the surviving 2,500men {{able to make the}} crossing was to begin at 20:45. The evacuation would be from north to south, and was modelled on the evacuation from Gallipoli in the First World War. During the day's fighting, some units had become isolated and never received the order to evacuate. Those capable of taking part were formed into groups of fourteen (the maximum capacity of the boats) and guided to the river by men from the Glider Pilot Regiment who during the day had reconnoitred and marked out two routes to the river. Under cover of an artillery barrage the evacuation started at 22:00. German infiltration of the perimeter caused problems during the withdrawal and some groups got into fire fights or were captured. When they reached the river, priority was given to the wounded and regardless of rank the soldiers waited in line for their turn to get into the boats.|$|E
25|$|It {{brought out}} the first {{separately}} published work of Samuel Beckett, a poem called Whoroscope (1930), Bob Brown's Words, and Pound's A Draft <b>of</b> <b>XXX</b> Cantos.

By 1931 Wyn Henderson had taken over day-to-day operation {{of the press and}} in the same year it published its last book, The Revaluation of Obscenity by sexologist Havelock Ellis.|$|E
25|$|In Operation Epsom (First Battle of the Odon, 26–30 June), VIII Corps was {{to advance}} southwards {{on the left}} flank <b>of</b> <b>XXX</b> Corps, west of Caen, across the River Odon and the Orne, to capture the high ground near Bretteville-sur-Laize, {{to the south of}} Caen. The attack was preceded by Operation Martlet (also known as Operation Dauntless) by XXX Corps, to secure the western flank of VIII Corps, by {{capturing}} the high ground of the Rauray Spur. The German defenders managed to contain the offensive in the vicinity of Hill 112 by committing all of their armoured units, including the two panzer divisions of the II SS Panzer Korps, newly arrived in Normandy and intended for a counter-offensive against British and American positions around Bayeux.|$|E

25|$|On 23 November Rommel {{gathered}} his two panzer divisions {{in an attack}} with the Ariete Armoured Division to cut off and destroy the rest <b>of</b> <b>XXX</b> Corps. In the pocket were the remains of 7th Armoured Division, 5th South African Infantry Brigade and elements of the recently arrived 6th NZ Brigade. By {{the end of the}} day 5th SA Brigade was destroyed and what remained of the defending force broke out of the pocket, heading south towards Bir el Gubi. Comando Supremo in Rome agreed to put the Italian XX Mobile Corps, including the Ariete Armoured and the Trieste Motorised Divisions, under Rommel's command. By 23 November, the Ariete, Trieste, and Savona had knocked out about 200 British tanks and a similar number of vehicles were disabled or destroyed. British losses from 19–23 November were around 350 tanks destroyed and 150 severely damaged.|$|E
25|$|The Eighth Army {{planned to}} engage {{and destroy the}} tanks of the Afrika Korps with the tanks <b>of</b> <b>XXX</b> Corps (Lieutenant-General Willoughby Norrie) in the 7th Armoured Division (Major-General William Gott), while the 1st South African Division (Major-General George Brink) covered their left flank. On the right flank, XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen), {{supported}} by the 4th Armoured Brigade Group (Brigadier Alexander Gatehouse), would make a clockwise flanking advance west of Sidi Omar with the 2nd New Zealand Division (Major-General Bernard Freyberg), while the 4th Indian Division contained the Axis frontier posts. The New Zealanders were {{to hold a position}} threatening the rear of the line of Axis defensive strong points, east from Sidi Omar to the coast at Halfaya. When the Axis tanks had been defeated, XXX Corps was to continue north-west to Tobruk and rendezvous with a break-out by the 70th Infantry Division garrison.|$|E
25|$|On 14 April the {{division}} crossed the River Lethe at Cloppenburg, where 204th Fd Co incurred severe casualties bridging the river under shellfire. The following day {{the division}} decisively crushed the last organised counter-attack against its troops. For {{the rest of}} the month 43rd Division protected the left flank <b>of</b> <b>XXX</b> Corps' drive towards Bremen. On 30 April the 43rd Division closed up to the small River Wörpe at Grasburg, which the leading infantry crossed while 204th Fd Co repaired the road bridge. The next day the advance was held up by numerous large craters in the causeway carrying the road, each of which had to be bridged under fire from Self-propelled guns, which was not complete until 3 May. On 4 May the division's infantry crossed the Oste-Hamme Canal by a footbridge, while 553 Fd Co built a Class 40 Bailey Bridge {{before the end of the}} day. The division's further advance to capture Bremerhaven the next day was forestalled by the German surrender at Lüneburg Heath.|$|E

25|$|In January 1945 {{the brigade}} {{was in the}} Ardennes forest, in February moving to the Reichswald forest where it was {{involved}} in Operation Veritable and, despite heavy fighting in terrible confitions, managed to clear the south-western edge of the forest. The brigade, {{along with the rest}} of the division, now part <b>of</b> <b>XXX</b> Corps under Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks, had a short rest after this, and began training for their next assignment, Operation Plunder, an amphibious assault crossing of the river Rhine. The operation began on the night of 23 March 1945, with Cassels' brigade crossing the river the following day. On the same day, however, the division's GOC, Major General Rennie, was killed by mortar fire and replaced as GOC by Major General Gordon MacMillan, a highly experienced and competent commander, who had led Cassels's brigade in Sicily. Despite the loss of the GOC, the division, Cassels's brigade in particular, was involved in heavy fighting in an attempt to expand the bridgehead. The brigade then advanced across Germany, and was at Bremen by late April, with the end of World War II in Europe following shortly after.|$|E
25|$|In July 1943 the {{regiment}} {{was assigned to}} 15th Army Group for the Allied invasion of Sicily. For the initial landings on 10 July, 55 HAA Rgt's three batteries were allotted to beach groups <b>of</b> <b>XXX</b> Corps arriving during the first morning, but regiments were mixed up and no overall AA HQ was landed, so {{a great deal of}} reorganisation was required during the first two days of the operation. The lightweight No 3 Mark III ('Baby Maggie') mobile gunlaying radar sets proved too fragile for landing over an open beach. Also, radio and telephone communications could not be established, and Allied airborne formations overflying the beachheads to their drop zones suffered badly from friendly fire. As Eighth Army advanced up the east coast of the island during July, batteries of 55 HAA Rgt were stationed to defend the port of Augusta, where it reported daily attacks by Messerschmitt Bf 109s and nightly attacks by Junkers Ju 88s operating from 28,000 to 30,000 feet. At Augusta, 55 HAA Rgt came under the command of 73 AA Bde, while 307th Bty back at Syracuse was under 62 AA Bde.|$|E
25|$|By dawn on 16 July the 15th (Scottish) Division had {{captured}} Bougy, Gavrus and dug in around Esquay {{and the western}} end of Point 113. On 17 July, the front line became quieter but the 44th Brigade was exposed by the success of the German defenders on the flanks and subjected to artillery bombardment. The 6th KOSB repulsed two attacks and the Germans defeated British attacks towards Évrecy. Two officers of the 8th RSF had led patrols towards Évrecy and found that German positions were still occupied. By the morning of 18 July the German positions were found to have been partly evacuated and the 6th KOSB pushed forward to the Bougy–Évrecy road. An attack by the 59th (Staffordshire) Division <b>of</b> <b>XXX</b> Corps, from the right (western) flank towards the positions of the 8th RS, made very slow progress. Four more German counter-attacks against the 44th Brigade were defeated. During the night the brigade was relieved by the 71st Brigade, 53rd (Welsh) Division and returned to Le Haut du Bosq, suffering several casualties on the way. The 9th SS-Panzer Division was brought up from reserve {{and by the end of}} the day had restored the front line, except at Hill 113.|$|E

25|$|The brigade was rebuilt by cannibalizing men {{and tanks}} from the newly arrived 24th Armoured Brigade {{and it was}} {{retrained}} in the infantry support role, although it wasn't redesignated as an Army Tank Brigade as would have been appropriate. On 11 August 1942 the 7th Battalion, Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own) was transferred away from the brigade and joined the 7th Motor Brigade, then part of the 7th Armoured Division but later {{became part of the}} 1st Armoured Division. During the Battle of Alam el Halfa in September the brigade was initially in XXX Corps' reserve, but was transferred to the command of XIII Corps' 10th Armoured Division. Before the Second Battle of El Alamein the brigade was reinforced by the addition of the 8th Royal Tank Regiment up to strength of approximately 186 Valentines and the 5th RHA was exchanged for the 107th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery equipped with sixteen Bishop self-propelled guns. During that battle most of the brigade's regiments were tasked to support the infantry divisions <b>of</b> <b>XXX</b> Corps. The 8th RTR was attached to the 1st South African Division, 40th RTR was attached to the 9th Australian Division and the 50th RTR was attached to 51st (Highland) Division. The brigade suffered heavily during the battle and it remained in Egypt to refit and reorganize. The 8th RTR was transferred to Palestine in early November after having turned over all its surviving tanks while the 46th RTR was removed from the brigade, as was 107th Field Regiment.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the attempt}} to envelop Caen had been repulsed, on the right flank <b>of</b> <b>XXX</b> Corps (the {{junction}} of the British Second and First US armies) the possibility for a flanking manoeuvre had developed. Since D-Day, the British and Americans had destroyed five German battle groups in this area, including the reserves of LXXXIV Corps, leaving only remnants of the 352nd Infantry Division in the Trévières–Agy sector. The 352nd Division had been in action since its defence of Omaha, on 6 June, and had received few replacements. The 1st US Infantry Division and the 2nd US Infantry Division had forced {{the collapse of the}} left flank of the 352nd Division. On the night of 9/10 June, the 352nd Division received permission to retire to Saint-Lô, which created a [...] gap in the German lines near Caumont-l'Éventé.

500|$|While the envelopment of Caen {{had been}} {{prevented}} by the Germans {{on the right}} flank <b>of</b> <b>XXX</b> Corps, at the junction between the British Second and United States First armies, five German battle groups, including the last reserves of LXXXIV Korps had been destroyed, leaving only {{the remnants of the}} 352nd Infantry Division defending the front from Trévières to Agy. American attacks caused the left flank of the division to collapse and on the night of [...] the division retreated to Saint-Lô; the withdrawal created a [...] gap between the Panzer-Lehr Division and the German troops near Caumont-l'Éventé, with only the 17th SS-Panzergrenadier Division reconnaissance battalion remaining in the area.
