5|$|A {{central part}} of the {{non-discrimination}} policy is the Mining Code of 7 August 1925. It is uncertain if the code is internationally binding, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> can be amended unilaterally by Norway. Specifically, the commissioner issues licenses to search for minerals and state-owned and other owner's land and to register claims. To maintain a claim, the owner must work 1,500 man-hours per five years and pay an annual fee of 6,000 Norwegian krone. However, the Ministry of Trade and Industry may grant exceptions from the work obligation under specific conditions.|$|E

5|$|On the book's publication, Waugh's friends praised it, but {{its general}} {{critical}} reception was muted.

5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol at a {{time when}} the British were {{examining}} and exploring Christmas traditions from the past, such as carols, as well as new customs such as Christmas trees. He was influenced by experiences from his own past, and from the Christmas stories of other authors, including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired to write the story following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged school, one of several establishments for London's half-starved, illiterate street children. The treatment of the poor and the ability of a self-interested man redeeming himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this was a fully secular story, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is a Christian allegory.|$|E
5|$|Evolution {{also does}} not require that organisms become more complex. Although the history of life shows an {{apparent}} trend towards the evolution of biological complexity; {{there is a question}} if this appearance of increased complexity is real, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> comes from neglecting the fact that the majority of life on Earth has always consisted of prokaryotes. In this view, complexity is not a necessary consequence of evolution, but that specific circumstances of evolution on Earth frequently made greater complexity advantageous and thus naturally selected for. Depending on the situation, organisms' complexity can either increase, decrease, or stay the same, and all three of these trends have been observed in evolution.|$|E
5|$|He {{writes that}} these {{positive}} results are achieved {{in a number}} of ways. Sometimes the industry-sponsored studies are flawed by design (for example by comparing the new drug to an existing drug at an inadequate dose), and sometimes patients are selected to make a positive result more likely. In addition, the data is analysed as the trial progresses. If the trial seems to be producing negative data it is stopped prematurely and the results are not published, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is producing positive data it may be stopped early so that longer-term effects are not examined. He writes that this publication bias, where negative results remain unpublished, is endemic within medicine and academia. As a consequence, he argues, doctors may have no idea what the effects are of the drugs they prescribe.|$|E

5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, {{the stage}} is assessed {{to determine whether the}} disease is localized and amenable to surgery <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> has spread {{to the point where it}} cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, {{it may be difficult to}} conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as the Court did not explain this.|$|E
5|$|It {{was planned}} to launch four {{satellites}} in December 1962. However, before the launches could take place, then Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara cancelled the program, due to concerns {{that it would}} not be able to operate if a full scale nuclear war broke out, and that only a small number of SAINTs could be launched at a time. The project had also gone over budget, spending over 100 million dollars, which was several times the funding that had been publicly reported. By the end of the 1960s, the concept of inspecting Soviet satellites was abandoned as the Soviets had begun installing destruction packages on their satellites, that would blow up both itself and the SAINT, by use of the APO-2 destruction system, which could either be set off by its operators in the USSR, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> sensed that it was being scanned. The standard American military reconnaissance satellite was capable of scanning other satellites long range, along with ground based detection of satellites.|$|E

5|$|Laying pipe {{took several}} stages. First, {{the right of}} way had to be cleared with chainsaws, bulldozers, and {{scrapers}} who followed the rough route laid out by the initial surveyors. These crews were followed by another group of surveyors and engineers who determined whether the pipeline could be laid in the planned spot, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had to be moved because of permafrost, soft ground, or other considerations. State and federal surveillance officers, working with the engineers, could give the OK to move the path of the pipeline as much as 200 feet to the right or left in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E
5|$|On November 18, 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in a {{goodwill}} {{gesture to}} South Korea {{during a visit}} to Seoul to ratify a new treaty, released both the flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of KAL007. Initial South Korean research showed the FDR to be empty and the CVR to have an unintelligible copy. The Russians then released the recordings to the ICAO Secretary General. The ICAO report continued to support the initial assertion that KAL007 accidentally flew in Soviet airspace, after listening to the flight crew's conversations recorded by the CVR, and confirming that either the aircraft had flown on a constant magnetic heading instead of activating the INS and following its assigned waypoints, <b>or,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had activated the INS, it had been activated when the aircraft had already deviated beyond the 7½-nautical mile Desired Track Envelope within which the waypoints would have been captured.|$|E
5|$|Stebbins and Edgar Anderson wrote a {{paper in}} 1954 on the {{importance}} of hybridization in adapting to new environments. They proposed novel adaptations would facilitate the invasion of habitats not utilized previously by either parent and that novel adaptations may facilitate the formation of stabilized hybrid species. Following this paper, Stebbins developed the first model of adaptive radiation. He proposed that a high degree of genetic variability was necessary for major evolutionary advances, that because of slow mutation rates, genetic recombination was the most likely source of this variation, and that variation could be maximised though hybridization. As of 2006, research is ongoing regarding whether hybridization is an accidental consequence of evolution <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is necessary for the creation and evolution of plant species; {{it has been argued that}} contemporary studies are part of an intellectual lineage that started with the work of Stebbins and Anderson.|$|E
