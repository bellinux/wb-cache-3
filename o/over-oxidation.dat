50|$|The {{initial and}} rate {{limiting}} step involving the electrophilic activation of RH2C-H by a PtII center to produce a PtII-CH2R species and a proton. The mechanism of this activation is debated. One possibility is {{the oxidative addition of}} a sigma coordinated C-H bond followed by the reductive removal of the proton. Another is a sigma-bond metathesis involving the formation of the M-C bond and a H-Cl or H-O bond. Regardless it is this step that kinetically imparts the chemoselectivity to the overall transformation. Stronger, more electron-rich bonds are activated preferentially over weaker, more electron-poor bonds of species that have already been partially oxidized.

5000|$|In 1911 the Dumet-wire seal {{was invented}} {{which is still}} the common {{practice}} to seal copper leads through soda-lime or lead glass. If copper is properly oxidised before it is wetted by molten glass a vacuum tight seal of good mechanical strength can be obtained. After copper is oxidized, it is often dipped in a borax solution, as borating the copper helps prevents <b>over-oxidation</b> when reintroduced to a flame. Simple copper wire is not usable because its {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} is much higher than that of the glass. Thus, on cooling a strong tensile force acts on the glass-to-metal interface and it breaks. Glass and glass-to-metal interfaces are especially sensitive to tensile stress. Dumet-wire is a copper clad wire (about 25% of the weight of the wire is copper) with a core of nickel-iron alloy 42, an alloy with a composition of about 42% nickel. [...] The core has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, allowing for a wire with a coefficient of radial thermal expansion which is slightly lower than the linear coefficient of thermal expansion of the glass, so that the glass-to-metal interface is under a low compression stress. It is not possible to adjust the axial thermal expansion of the wire as well. Because of the much higher mechanical strength of the nickel-iron core compared to the copper, the axial thermal expansion of the Dumet-wire is about the same as of the core. Thus, a shear stress builds up which is limited to a safe value by the low tensile strength of the copper. This is also the reason why Dumet is only useful for wire diameters lower than about 0.5 mm. In a typical Dumet seal through the base of a vacuum tube a short piece of Dumet-wire is butt welded to a nickel wire at one end and a copper wire at the other end. When the base is pressed of lead glass the Dumet-wire and a short part of the nickel and the copper wire are enclosed in the glass. Then the nickel wire and the glass around the Dumet-wire are heated by a gas flame and the glass seals to the Dumet-wire. The nickel and copper do not seal vacuum tight to the glass but are mechanically supported. The butt welding also avoids problems with gas-leakages at the interface between the core wire and the copper.|$|E

Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B (PTP 1 B) is an important member of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPs) family that shares a conserved catalytic cysteine thiol residue. PTP 1 B acts as a negative regulator of insulin mediated signaling cascade, as inhibition of PTP 1 B is shown to increase the insulin sensitivity. A key feature of signal transduction pathway involves transient inactivation of PTP 1 B by an insulin stimulated burst of hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic cysteine thiol of PTP 1 B undergoes oxidation in presence of hydrogen peroxide to generate an inactive sulfenic acid, which is reactivated by the action of cellular thiols and reducing enzymes. However, recent evidences suggest an unique chemical transformation to generate sulfenyl amide (3 -isothiazolidinone) from sulfenic acid at the active site of PTP 1 B. The mechanism for the formation of this novel sulfenyl amide is not clear. We employed 1, 2 -benzisothiazolidinone as chemical model to mimic the important functional groups present at the active site of enzyme and examined the chemical mechanism leading to the formation of sulfenyl amide. Our results supported a direct intramolecular attack of neighboring amide nitrogen onto the sulfenic acid to generate sulfenyl amide. Generation of the novel sulfenyl amide heterocycle is believed to protect the enzyme against irreversible <b>over-oxidation</b> to sulfinic and sulfonic acids. However, as the claims lacked a strong experimental support, we used our chemical models to estimate the rate constant for the hydrogen peroxide-mediated <b>over-oxidation</b> of sulfenyl amide. Our results suggested that sulfenyl amide does in fact resist irreversible <b>over-oxidation</b> compared to a sulfenic acid surrogate. Furthermore, we developed a method to generate sulfenyl amide during the hydrogen peroxide-mediated oxidation of PTP 1 B in aqueous buffer solution. In addition, we determined the rate constant for the formation and <b>over-oxidation</b> of sulfenyl amide at the active site of PTP 1 B. We also utilized our model compounds to examine the chemical properties of "overoxidized" intermediates. Our results suggested that <b>over-oxidation</b> of sulfenyl amide will generate a thiol reversible but hydrolytically labile sulfinyl amide. We extended our knowledge gained from the model studies and investigated the formation of sulfinyl amide during oxidative inactivation of PTP 1 B. Consistent with our expectations, we were successful in identifying a thiol reversible but hydrolytically labile intermediate at the active site of PTP 1 B. Furthermore, we determined the rate constant for the hydrolysis of sulfinyl amide formed in PTP 1 B. Overall, our findings provided first evidence for the formation of this novel thiol-reversible sulfinyl amide heterocycle during the redox regulation of PTP 1 B. In addition, our results suggest that formation of sulfinyl amide may protect the enzyme against irreversible <b>over-oxidation.</b> In a different context, we examined possible chemical mechanisms underlying the biological activity of natural product S-deoxy leinamycin. We synthesized a crucial triggering unit 1, 2 -dithiolan 3 -one moiety of the natural product and investigated the generation of reactive oxygen species using DNA cleavage assays. Our results suggested that the reaction of 1, 2 - dithiolan 3 -one heterocycle found in S-deoxy leinamycin with thiols leads to the generation of persulfide intermediate (RSS-). The persulfide intermediate then generates biologically active polysulfides, hydrogen sulfide and reactive oxygen species that may ultimately explain the biological activity of S-deoxy leinamycin...|$|E
