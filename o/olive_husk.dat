40|$|The waste {{products}} derived from olive oil extraction are an aqueous effluent (vegetation water) {{and a solid}} residue, mainly containing the olive skin and stone (<b>olive</b> <b>husk).</b> Biological purification of the vegetation water is particularly difficult because it contains solids in suspension, and {{a high concentration of}} polluting organic compounds and mineral salts. In addition, since the recovery of oil by solvent extraction from the <b>olive</b> <b>husk</b> is no longer a profitable process, the <b>olive</b> <b>husk</b> has become a waste product that must be disposed of. In this work, samples of vegetation water (VW) from olive oil mills were separated by evaporation into an aqueous liquid (80 - 90 % of the initial volume), that could then be purified by a traditional biological process, and a residue in which about 98 % of the organic load was concentrated. The properties of the concentrated VW residue and of the <b>olive</b> <b>husk</b> suggested the possibility of using a mixture of the two as an efficient fuel to provide the heat for the evaporation stage.

The problem of incompatibility between the hydrophilic wood filler and the LDPE hydrophobic matrix was treated by two methods: a chemical modification of the <b>olive</b> <b>husk</b> flour with maleic anhydride to esterify the free hydroxyl groups of the wood components {{and the use of}} a compatibilizer agent, i. e. an ethylene-butyl acrylate-glycidyl methacrylate (EBAGMA) terpolymer. The changes in the structure, the morphology, and the properties resulting from these treatments were followed by various techniques, especially FTIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), tensile measurements and water absorption. The experimental results indicated that both methods, i. e. the chemical treatment of the <b>olive</b> <b>husk</b> flour with maleic anhydride and the inclusion of EBAGMA terpolymer, improved the interactions between the two composite components and promoted better dispersion of the filler in the matrix.

40|$|The {{olive oil}} {{industry}} in Australia {{has been growing}} at a rapid rate over the past decade. It is forecast to continue growing due to the steady increase in demand for olive oil and olive products in the local and regional market. However, the olive oil extraction process generates large amounts of solid waste called <b>olive</b> <b>husk</b> which is currently underutilized. This paper uses life-cycle methodology to analyse the carbon emission reduction potential of utilizing <b>olive</b> <b>husk</b> as a feedstock in a mobile pyrolysis unit. Four scenarios, based on different combinations of pyrolysis technologies (slow versus fast) and end-use of products (land application versus energy utilization), are constructed.

During composting grape marc pile and cork pile were fertilized with ammonium nitrate, superphosphate, iron sulphate and magnesium sulphate. The evolution of temperature, pH, mineral nitro-gen (N NH 4 + and N NO 3), total nitrogen, organic matter, C/N ratio, electrical conductivity and cation exchange capacity were measured each week. In order to estimate compost maturity, phytotoxicity test, employing index germination, and nitrogen drawdown index (NDI) were used.

40|$|AbstractNatural fibers are {{composed}} mainly of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, with the composition varying {{according to the}} type of plant and geographic region. Their low density, easy processing, low cost, abundance and biodegradability make them ideal for use as organic filler in polymer matrices. The final properties and, therefore, the potential applications of the obtained composite materials, depend on the composition of the fiber, the interfacial adhesion with the matrix, the size of the particle and the aggregate weight percent. In this paper we revise the suitability of wastes from olive and wine industries through a comparative study of the resulting particles for subsequent use in polymer matrix composites.

40|$|This work {{is aimed}} at calculating the energy content of the {{residues}} from olive oil production. Olive pulp, <b>olive</b> <b>husk</b> and sludge (a mixture of olive pulp and husk) have been analyzed separately. Olive Mill Effluents (OME) are normally a problem for olive mill farms, yet they {{may be used as}} feedstock for biomass-fuelled power plants. Nonetheless, OMEs are characterized by a relatively high humidity content and are produced only during the olive season. Thus, OME need a stabilization process to be employed as a solid biofuel throughout the year. The analyses conducted attempt an evaluation of the energy consumption of a three-stage stabilization process: drying, milling and pelletising. The net electrical energy available from OME is then calculated as a difference between gross energy available and energy consumed for stabilization. The gross available electrical energy was calculated based on direct energy conversion of the stabilized feedstock on a small scale direct combustion and Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) turbine. Results show that OME are suitable for energy production.

In previous research, using only olive oil and cork waste, biomass pellets were obtained having high calorific values (20. 6 MJ/kg and 22. 2 MJ/kg), low moisture (8. 9 %) and relatively a low ash percentage (3. 9 %). Several new formulations and their relevance to the calorific value were now tested using other waste or by-products. The potential inclusion of olive leaves from the olive oil industry, grape husks and grape seeds from the winery industry and chestnut shells (outer shell and inner skin) from the chestnut industry has been analysed. This process will contribute to solving environmental problems resulting from the discharge of those waste and effluents and to create a viable and profitable alternative to their storage and/or deposition in landfill. The increase of other biomass sources for these types of process is extremely important from an environmental and economic management point of view.

Soil respiration and microbial biomass data indicated that the addition of MOH-residues strongly increased microbial activity proportionally to the amounts added. Data of qCO 2 suggested that the respiration to biomass ratio of the microbial population was strongly modified by MOH-residues additions during the first 90 days of incubation. The qCO 2 data suggested a low efficiency in energy yields from C oxidation during the first 2 months of soil incubation. qFDA seemed to be relatively unaffected for treatments D and 2 D {{as compared to the}} control, but was significantly lowered by the application of 10 D, showing the lowest hydrolytic activity of microbial biomass in this treatment up to 360 days of incubation. o-Diphenoloxidase activity was delayed, and this delay was extended with the addition of larger quantities of MOH-residues. Alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase and dehydrogenase activities were in line with the findings on microbial biomass changes and activities. The biological and biochemical data suggest that the addition of a large quantity of MOH-residues (80 x 10 (3) kg ha- 1) strongly modifies the soil characteristics affecting the r- and K-strategist populations, and that these changes last for at least the 360 days of incubation.

An adsorption/desorption experiment was also performed to assess the retention capacity of substrates tested against fungicide metalaxyl. The goal of the work was {{to determine the extent of}} the adsorption/desorption of the mobile fungicide metalaxyl in substrates containing different amounts and quality of organic carbon and to characterize the relationship between the carbon fractions and the adsorption/desorption parameters determined. The Kads values found in the organic substrates turned out to be higher than those reported for soils, indicating the highest sorption capability of these materials and their suitability to be used as bio-filters for decontaminating water. The quality of organic carbon strongly influenced the entity and the reversibility of bonds between substrates and fungicide. The influence of different organic fractions on the adsorption of metalaxyl can be summarized in the order of humic acids carbon > total humified extractable carbon > total organic carbon > total carbon, leading to the conclusion that the presence of the humified fraction in the organic substrates is essential for a good performance of biofilters. Indeed, the desorption experiment evidenced that metalaxyl is less desorbed in the most humified substrates. Therefore, in bio-depuration systems such as biobed it is convenient to use mature substrates, which have to undergo a composting process, leading to high humus content and quality, responsible for irreversible bonds with pesticides...|$|R

40|$|The {{gasification}} {{plays an}} important role in solving the problems of waste-to-energy (WTE) processes. The most important drawback, common to the gasification processes used in WTE technology, consists of the need of cleaning facilities to obtain a clean syngas for powering generation. To eliminate this drawback and to obtain a sufficiently clean syngas, ready for a further use, a gasifier consisting of two stages in series was developed. Although the developed gasifier was tested in a lab-plant scale with various wastes, it was not taken into account how the performances change as a function of the injected waste. Aim of this paper is therefore to compare the effect of different feedings waste, i. e. RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel), ASR (Automotive Shredder Residue) and biomass such as <b>olive</b> oil <b>husk,</b> bagasse, and swithgrass on the gasifying performance of gasifier at two stages. This aim is accomplished by examining either already published or new data relevant the selected wastes. Two main items, namely residual carbon at stage one and syngas composition at stage two, are taken into account to perform this comparison by considering kinetic and thermodynamic of the process. According to the found kinetic law, carbon deposition at stage one is typical of the first hours of process and is characteristic of the short-time test normally performed in a bench scale reactor. As far as stage two concerns, the heat content of the outgoing syngas depends on the ultimate analysis of the used wastes in terms of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. A thermodynamic analysis of the experimental data confirms the correctness of such a deduction...|$|R
500|$|The station tested {{co-firing}} biomass in {{the summer}} of 2004, and in doing so was the first power station in the UK to be fuelled by wood. The initial trial of 14,100 tonnes of willow was locally sourced from nearby Eggborough. Since the trial, the station's use of biomass has continued. It uses direct injection for firing the biomass, whereby it bypasses the pulverising mills and is either injected directly into the boiler or the fuel line, for greater throughput. In 2009 a target was set for 12.5% of the station's energy to be sourced from biomass, and the shift to biomass was intended to contribute to the aim of cutting [...] emissions by 15%. The station burns a large range of biomass, mostly wood pellets, sunflower pellets, <b>olive,</b> peanut shell <b>husk</b> and rape meal. The majority comes from overseas. A 100,000 tonne pa capacity straw pelletization facility was constructed at Capitol Park, Goole in 2008, opened 2009. Construction of specialised biomass handling facilities began in 2009 at the Port of Tyne and at Drax.|$|R
40|$| 0;years {{and this}} has raised {{concerns}} over its safe handling and utilization. Fires, and sometimes explosions, are a risk during all stages of fuel production as well as during the handling and utilization of the product. This paper presents a method for assessing ignition risk and provides a ranking of relative risk of ignition of biomass fuels. Tests involved single particle measurements, thermal analysis, dust layer and basket ignition tests. In all cases, smouldering combustion was observed, whereby the fuels pyrolyse to produce a black char, which then subsequently ignites. Low temperature pyrolysis kinetics have been utilised to predict ignition delay times at low temperatures. A method for evaluating risk was explored based on the activation energy for pyrolysis and a characteristic temperature from {TGA} analysis. Here, <b>olive</b> cake, sunflower <b>husk</b> and Miscanthus fall into the high risk category, while the woods, plane, pine, mesquite and red berry juniper, fall into the medium risk category. This method is able to capture the impact of low activation energy for pyrolysis on the increased risk of ignition...|$|R
