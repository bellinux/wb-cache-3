Chronic low back pain is associated with sleep problems, including a greater amount of time needed to fall asleep, disturbances during sleep, a shorter duration <b>of</b> <b>sleep,</b> <b>and</b> less satisfaction with sleep. In addition, a majority of those with chronic low back pain show symptoms of depression or anxiety.|$|E

He was also troubled with wanting to leave his manager, Michael Jeffery. Hendrix was fatigued and suffering from poor health, due in part to severe exhaustion caused by overworking, a chronic lack <b>of</b> <b>sleep,</b> <b>and</b> a persistent illness assumed to be influenza-related. Lacking trusting personal relationships, his insecurities about the future and disillusionment with the music industry contributed to his frustration.|$|E

5|$|For {{some days}} Hendrix {{had been in}} poor health, {{due in part to}} fatigue caused by overworking, a chronic lack <b>of</b> <b>sleep,</b> <b>and</b> an illness assumed to be influenza-related. Insecurities about his {{personal}} relationships and disillusionment with the music industry had also contributed to his frustration. Although the details of his final hours and death are disputed, Hendrix spent much of his last day with Monika Dannemann. During the morning of September18, she found him unresponsive in her apartment at the Samarkand Hotel, 22Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill. She called for an ambulance at 11:18a.m., and he was taken to St Mary Abbot's Hospital where an attempt was made to resuscitate him. He was pronounced dead at 12:45p.m.|$|E
5|$|Streamside camps offered wood, water, {{and some}} {{protection}} from the hazards of open land. The prairie could be dangerous in time of native unrest, and trade ceased entirely for a time during the Dakota War of 1862. Prairie fires, driven by winds, were a risk in dry spells. Wet weather turned rivers into torrents, approaches to streams into bogs, and worn paths into morasses. Blizzards could strand traders and threaten them with starvation. Insects harassed both the traders and their draft animals, depriving them <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>and</b> weakening them.|$|E
5|$|The {{content is}} divided into 14 chapters. The first chapter serves as an {{introduction}} and considers the mythological and geological origin of night. The next 12 chapters are each titled after an hour starting with chapter 2's 6 pm and ending with chapter 13's 5 am. Chapter 2 discusses the transition into night, including sunsets, the green flash, the stages of twilight, as well as Olbers' paradox, and a definition of the size and speed of night. The 7 pm chapter deals with nature at night, how animals see and hear differently at night {{with a focus on}} bats, nighthawks, and nocturnal insects. The 8 pm chapter analyzes children's literature and bedtime stories. The 9 pm chapter discusses aspects of the city at night, including the evolution of nightclubs, street lights, and the impacts of light pollution. The 10 pm chapter discusses night festivals around the world and throughout history. The 11 pm chapter explains the circadian rhythm and the physiology <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>and</b> dreams.|$|E

40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} whether nocturnal vagal tone as indexed by the high-frequency (HF) power component of {{heart rate variability}} is related to measures <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> depth <b>and</b> daytime perceptions <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> quality, sleepiness, <b>and</b> fatigue in alcohol dependence. Methods: Abstinent alcohol-dependent patients (n 14) and comparison control subjects (n 14) underwent all-night polysomnography along with assessment of heart rate variability during an awake period before <b>sleep</b> <b>and</b> during <b>sleep.</b> Sleep-quality perceptions, along with self-reported sleepiness and levels of energy and fatigue, were obtained in the morning. Results: As compared with control subjects, alcohol-dependent persons showed marked decreases in delta sleep along with impairments <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> quality <b>and</b> daytime energy. In addition, alcoholics showed a decrease of the HF power component of heart rate variability during the awake period before <b>sleep</b> <b>and</b> during nocturnal <b>sleep</b> as compared with control subjects. HF power during the awake period before sleep correlated with electroencephalographic delta <b>sleep</b> <b>and</b> delta power observed during the subsequent sleep period. HF power during the awake period before sleep also correlated with morning reports <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> quality, sleepiness, <b>and</b> fatigue. Conclusions: Alcohol dependence compromises vagal output measured before sleep onset, which correlates with loss <b>of</b> delta <b>sleep</b> <b>and</b> with morning reports <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> impairments. Testing <b>of</b> interventions that target sympathovagal balance might identify new strategies for partial amelioration <b>of</b> the <b>sleep</b> disturbances <b>and</b> impairments in daytime functioning observed in persons with alcohol dependence. Key words: alcoholism, sleep, fatigue, sympathetic nervous system, parasympathetic nervous system, heart rate variability, vagal tone...|$|R
5|$|Velázquez's {{portrait}} is {{a staging}} {{of a private}} moment of intimacy and a dramatic departure from the classical depictions <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>and</b> intimacy found in works from antiquity and Venetian art that portray Venus. However, the simplicity with which Velázquez displays the female nude—without jewellery {{or any of the}} goddess's usual accessories—was echoed in later nude studies by Ingres, Manet, and Baudry, among others. In addition, Velázquez's depiction of Venus as a reclining nude viewed from the rear was a rarity before that time, although the pose has been painted by many later artists. Manet, in his stark female portrayal Olympia, paraphrased the Rokeby Venus in pose and by suggesting the persona of a real woman rather than an ethereal goddess. Olympia shocked the Parisian art world when it was first exhibited in 1863. Olympia gazes directly out at the viewer, as does Velázquez's Venus, only through the reflection of the mirror.|$|E

25|$|The first semi-multiple-systematic {{study of}} the {{connection}} between sleep and memory was conducted in 1924 by Jenkins and Dallenbach, for the purpose of testing Hermann Ebbinghaus' memory decay theory. Their results showed that memory retention was much better after a period of sleep compared to the same time interval spent awake. It was not until 1953, however, when sleep was delineated into rapid eye movement sleep and non-rapid eye movement sleep, that studies focusing on the effect of specific sleep stages on memory were conducted. As behavioral characteristics of the effects <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>and</b> memory are becoming increasingly understood and supported, researchers are turning to the weakly understood neural basis <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>and</b> memory.|$|E

25|$|Diagnosing {{sleep apnea}} usually {{requires}} a professional sleep study {{performed in a}} sleep clinic, because the episodes of wakefulness caused by the disorder are extremely brief and patients usually do not remember experiencing them.

Rarely occurring, but of importance, are allergic reactions of paradoxical bronchospasms, urticaria (hives), angioedema, hypotension, and collapse.

25|$|Researchers {{approach}} the study <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>and</b> memory from different angles. Some studies measure {{the effects of}} sleep deprivation after a novel task is taught (the subject learns the task and is sleep deprived afterwards).

Conversely, other experiments have been conducted that measure the effects of sleep deprivation before a task has been taught (the subject is sleep-deprived and then learns a task). This is referred to as pre-training sleep deprivation.|$|E
25|$|The neurobehavioral {{basis for}} these {{has been studied}} only recently. Sleep {{deprivation}} has been strongly correlated with increased probability of accidents and industrial errors. Many studies have shown the slowing of metabolic activity in the brain with many hours of sleep debt.

25|$|In the R standard, NREM {{sleep was}} divided into four stages, with slow-wave sleep {{comprising}} stages 3 and 4. In stage 3, delta waves made up less than 50% of the total wave patterns, while they made up more than 50% in stage 4. Furthermore, REM sleep was {{sometimes referred to as}} stage 5. In 2004, the AASM commissioned the AASM Visual Scoring Task Force to review the R scoring system. The review resulted in several changes, the most significant being the combination of stages 3 and 4 into Stage N3. The revised scoring was published in 2007 as The AASM Manual for the Scoring <b>of</b> <b>Sleep</b> <b>and</b> Associated Events. Arousals, respiratory, cardiac, and movement events were also added.|$|E

25|$|Minocycline {{may cause}} upset stomach, diarrhea, dizziness, unsteadiness, drowsiness, mouth sores, {{headache}} and vomiting. Minocycline increases sensitivity to sunlight. Minocycline {{may affect the}} quality <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>and</b> rarely cause sleep disorders. It has also been linked to cases of lupus. Prolonged use of minocycline {{over an extended period}} of time can lead to blue-gray skin, fingernails and staining of scar tissue. This staining is not permanent but can take a very long time for the skin color to return to normal; on the other hand a muddy brown skin color in sun exposed areas is usually a permanent skin discolouration. Permanent blue discoloration of gums or teeth discoloration may also occur. Rare but serious side effects include fever, yellowing of the eyes or skin, stomach pain, sore throat, vision changes, and mental changes, including depersonalization.|$|E
50|$|The social {{sciences}} and humanities too, Williams suggests, are implicated in these very processes and dynamics, thereby further profiling, promoting or problematising <b>and</b> hence politicising <b>sleep,</b> both inside <b>and</b> outside the academy, the laboratory and the clinic. This for example, includes recent sociological research on: gender, <b>sleep</b> <b>and</b> the life course; the social <b>and</b> health patterning <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> quality <b>and</b> duration, and; the medicalisation <b>of</b> <b>sleep.</b> Comparative historical <b>and</b> cross-cultural research is also now shedding further valuable new light {{on a range of}} sleep-related matters such as the transformation <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> science; sleep in (pre)industrial times, and; <b>sleep</b> <b>and</b> night-time in Asia and the West.|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> {{problems in}} individuals with intellectual disability (ID) seems to vary between genetic syndromes associated with ID.
