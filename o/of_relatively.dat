5|$|Among the few {{remains of}} {{buildings}} {{from the interior}} of the town, most notable are a large monumental staircase and a large church, with dimensions of some , in the northeast. The church was <b>of</b> <b>relatively</b> simple construction, but of unusual size, and A. Bon proposes its identification with the church of the Franciscans, where assemblies of the nobles of Achaea were held in 1276 and 1289. The remaining portions of the church's walls were completely destroyed by the German Army during the Occupation.|$|E
5|$|Another nocturnal {{adaptation}} {{can be seen}} in kangaroo rats, which exhibit moonlight avoidance. These rodents forage {{in relatively}} open habitats and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas <b>of</b> <b>relatively</b> dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. In controlled experiments, artificial moon-like illumination stimulates similar responses in their foraging behavior, suggesting that this behavior has evolved to reduce predation risk.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>relatively</b> intense {{language}} contact, Central Atlas Tamazight {{has a large}} stratum of Arabic loans. Many borrowed words in Berber also have native synonyms, e.g. /lbab/ or /tiflut/ 'door', the latter used more in rural areas. The contact was unequal, as Moroccan Arabic has not borrowed as much from Berber languages, though Berber has contributed to Moroccan and Algerian Arabics' very reduced vowel systems.|$|E

5|$|Azhdarchids are now {{well-known}} {{as being}} terrestrial predators akin to ground hornbills or some storks, eating any prey item they could swallow whole. Two major {{exceptions to this}} are Hatzegopteryx, which was a robustly built raptorial predator <b>of</b> <b>relatively</b> large prey, including medium-sized dinosaurs; and Alanqa, {{which may have been}} a specialist molluscivore.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} not an exact science. Decompression models {{approximate}} a physiological process that is incompletely understood, and rather complex, by simple mathematical models, {{in the hope of}} producing a useful procedure with acceptably low risk of injury to the user. New information allows theories and models to be modified to provide more reliable results, and the availability of faster and more powerful computer processors at low cost has made more exhaustive numerical methods more practicable, and the computation <b>of</b> <b>relatively</b> far more complex models is now quite possible, even in real time.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{which follows}} the {{procedure}} <b>of</b> <b>relatively</b> fast ascent interrupted by periods at constant depth {{is known as}} staged decompression. The ascent rate and the depth and duration of the stops are integral parts of the decompression process. The advantage of staged decompression {{is that it is}} far easier to monitor and control than continuous decompression.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{extremely}} dense at this time—far denser than {{is usually}} required {{to form a}} black hole—the universe did not re-collapse into a black hole. This {{may be explained by}} considering that commonly-used calculations and limits for gravitational collapse are usually based upon objects <b>of</b> <b>relatively</b> constant size, such as stars, and do not apply to rapidly expanding space such as the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{determined}} {{resistance of}} the 99th Division, which was composed <b>of</b> <b>relatively</b> inexperienced troops, along with the experienced 2nd and 30th Divisions, the northern shoulder of the Battle of the Bulge was a sticking point for the entire offensive operation. Had the Americans given way, the German advance would have overrun the vast supply depots around Liège and Spa and possibly have changed {{the outcome of the}} Battle of Bulge.|$|E
5|$|In 1345, while Grosmont was in France, {{his father}} died. The younger Henry was now Earl of Lancaster – the wealthiest and most {{powerful}} peer of the realm. After participating in the Siege of Calais in 1347, the king honoured Lancaster by including him as a founding knight of the Order of the Garter in 1348. A few years later, in 1351, Edward bestowed an even greater honour on Lancaster when he created him Duke of Lancaster. The title of duke was <b>of</b> <b>relatively</b> new origin in England; only one other ducal title existed previously.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, Bethe, {{along with}} IBM {{physicist}} Richard Garwin, {{published an article}} criticising in detail the anti-ICBM defense system proposed by the Department of Defense. The two physicists described in the article that nearly any measure taken by the US would be easily thwarted with the deployment <b>of</b> <b>relatively</b> simple decoys.

5|$|Regardless of {{the type}} of {{metabolic}} process they employ, the majority of bacteria are able to take in raw materials only in the form <b>of</b> <b>relatively</b> small molecules, which enter the cell by diffusion or through molecular channels in cell membranes. The Planctomycetes are the exception (as they are in possessing membranes around their nuclear material). It has recently been shown that Gemmata obscuriglobus is able to take in large molecules via a process that in some ways resembles endocytosis, the process used by eukaryotic cells to engulf external items.|$|E

5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{does not}} itself have many predators and large {{individuals}} are adept at jumping and swimming to escape attackers. Any attached juveniles benefit from this. However, the scallops are intolerant of low salinity levels, and mortality sometimes occurs {{as a result}} of a pool <b>of</b> <b>relatively</b> fresh water that sometimes forms during the summer months under the sea ice as it melts.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic {{hurricane}} season officially began on June 1, 1989. It was an above average {{season in which}} 15 tropical depressions formed. Eleven depressions attained tropical storm status, and seven of these attained hurricane status. Two hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes. The season was above average most likely because <b>of</b> <b>relatively</b> small amounts of dust within the Saharan Air Layer. Four hurricanes and one tropical storm made landfall during the season and caused 124deaths and at least $10.54billion in damage.|$|E
