5|$|Unlike {{precious}} metals such as gold or platinum, gem diamonds do not trade as a commodity: {{there is a}} substantial mark-up in the sale <b>of</b> <b>diamonds,</b> and there is not a very active market for resale <b>of</b> <b>diamonds.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once {{diamonds}} {{have been}} {{transported to the}} surface by magma in a volcanic pipe, they may erode out and be distributed over a large area. A volcanic pipe containing diamonds {{is known as a}} primary source <b>of</b> <b>diamonds.</b> Secondary sources <b>of</b> <b>diamonds</b> include all areas where a significant number <b>of</b> <b>diamonds</b> have been eroded out of their kimberlite or lamproite matrix, and accumulated because of water or wind action. These include alluvial deposits and deposits along existing and ancient shorelines, where loose diamonds tend to accumulate because of their size and density. Diamonds have also rarely been found in deposits left behind by glaciers (notably in Wisconsin and Indiana); in contrast to alluvial deposits, glacial deposits are minor and are therefore not viable commercial sources of diamond.|$|E

5|$|Ballas and {{carbonado}} diamond are exceptional, as {{they are}} polycrystalline and therefore much tougher than single-crystal diamond; they are used for deep-drilling bits and other demanding industrial applications.

40|$|Pulsed-UV-laser surface {{ablation}} {{has been}} applied in substrate pretreatment {{in order to obtain}} good adhesion <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> coating grown on cobalt-cemented tungsten carbide hardmetal. The dependence <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> coating's adhesion on different shots of pulsed-UV-laser substrate pretreatment has been studied experimentally. The results were compared with diamond coating deposited by using traditional acid-etching substrate pretreatment. It was shown that adhesion <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> coating grown on tungsten carbide hardmetal has been greatly improved by using pulsed-UV-laser substrate pretreatment. The corresponding laser pretreatment condition for the optimal adhesion <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> coatings was finally obtained. It has been demonstrated that pulsed-UV-laser substrate pretreatment should be a feasible and effective method for improving adhesion <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> coating on cobalt-cemented tungsten carbide hardmetal. It is the characteristic surface morphology produced by pulsed-UV-laser surface ablation that subsequently results in this improved adhesion <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> coating grown on tungsten carbide hardmetal. The number of laser shots being used in substrate pretreatment has a great influence to the adhesion <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> coating deposited on tungsten carbide hardmetal. One should always apply proper number of laser shots in pulsed-UV-laser substrate pretreatment when seeking for the optimal adhesion <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> coating on tungsten carbide hardmetal. In this work, the corresponding number of laser shots for the optimal adhesion <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> coating has found to be 300 laser shots...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} main aspects in the {{structure}} <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> nanoparticles to be considered: the overall shape, the core, and the surface. Through multiple diffraction experiments, it has been determined that the overall shape <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> nanoparticles is either spherical or elliptical. At the core <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> nanoparticles lies a diamond cage, which is composed mainly of carbons. While the core closely resemble the structure <b>of</b> a <b>diamond,</b> the surface <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> nanoparticles actually resemble the structure of graphite. A recent study shows that the surface consists mainly of carbons, with high amounts of phenols, pyrones, and sulfonic acid, as well as carboxylic acid groups, hydroxyl groups, and epoxide groups, though in lesser amounts. Occasionally, defects such as nitrogen-vacancy centers can be found {{in the structure}} <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> nanoparticles. 15N NMR research confirms presence of such defects. A recent study shows that the frequency of nitrogen-vacancy centers decreases with the size <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> nanoparticles.|$|R

40|$|Diamond-coated hard alloys are {{prospective}} tool {{materials for}} extreme cutting conditions. Nucleation rate {{is one of}} important factors that affect the qualities <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> thin films on WC-Co alloys. However, theoretical reports on nucleation rate <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> films on WC-Co alloys are scarce. Combining the unique diamond strong orientation with substrate surface properties, an improved theoretical formula on nucleation rate <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> films on the WC-Co alloys is deduced in this paper. First, taking account of the strong texture <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> crystal, the expression, which {{is closer to the}} practical deposition process <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> films on WC-Co alloys, is exclusively involved in both the effects of substrate compositions and substrate surface defects on the nucleation rate.

5|$|Diamonds {{prepared}} as gemstones are sold on diamond exchanges called bourses. There are 28 registered diamond bourses in the world. Bourses are the final tightly controlled {{step in the}} diamond supply chain; wholesalers and even retailers are able to buy relatively small lots <b>of</b> <b>diamonds</b> at the bourses, after which they are prepared for final sale to the consumer. Diamonds can be sold already set in jewelry, or sold unset ("loose"). According to the Rio Tinto Group, in 2002 the diamonds produced and released to the market were valued at US$9billion as rough diamonds, US$14billion after being cut and polished, US$28billion in wholesale diamond jewelry, and US$57billion in retail sales.|$|E
5|$|During David Dacko's {{presidency}} from 1960 to 1966, {{there was}} {{a significant increase in the}} production <b>of</b> <b>diamonds.</b> This occurred when the monopoly of the French concessionary companies was ended with a law allowing local citizens to dig for diamonds. After Dacko set up a diamond cutting factory at Bangui, diamonds became the country's leading export. But by the end of his five year's tenure, rampant corruption and financial indiscipline had resulted in workers being left unpaid and civil unrest ensued. Bokassa then seized power in a military coup in 1966.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in the fabrication and characterization of semiconductor and metallic nanowires are proving very successful in meeting the high expectations <b>of</b> nanotechnologists.

In an attempt to predict the electronic properties <b>of</b> <b>diamond</b> nanowires, we have used ab initio techniques to calculate the electronic density of states <b>of</b> stable <b>diamond</b> nanowires, with cubic and dodecahedral surface facets.
