40|$|Purpose: {{estimation}} of ubiquity <b>of</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> among qualified sportsmen of Ukraine in {{different kinds of}} sports and determination of specificities <b>of</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> syndrome’s formation among them. Material: in the research qualified sportsmen {{of different kinds of}} sports (n= 286) participated. For determination <b>of</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> degree we used the questionnaire of Leonova. Results: in 104 sportsmen we registered symptoms <b>of</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> <b>of</b> different degree. Among women symptoms of chronic degree were registered oftener (47. 0 %), than among men (29. 2 %). Most <b>of</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> cases were noticed in swimming, light athletics and football. Formation <b>of</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> was preceded by certain stages: overtiredness, over tension, over training. In 36. 4 % of the questioned sportsmen we registered chronic <b>fatigue</b> symptoms <b>of</b> different degree. We offered a model <b>of</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> and syndrome <b>of</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> formation in qualified sportsmen. Conclusions: progressing <b>of</b> sportsmen’s chronic <b>fatigue</b> and chronic fatigue syndrome are characterized by gradual appearing of stable or relapsing significant tiredness or by quick tiredness. As a result we can observe reduction of usual activity during long period of time (more than one month) ...|$|R

5|$|Following the {{discovery}} <b>of</b> <b>fatigue</b> cracks, developing {{due to their}} low-altitude usage, the B.2R strategic bombers were retired and placed in storage {{by the end of}} 1968. The RAF had experienced intense demand on its existing aerial refuelling tanker fleet, and its existing fleet of Victor B.1 tankers that had been converted earlier were due to be retired in the 1970s, so it was decided that the stored Victor B.2Rs would be converted to tankers also. Handley Page prepared a modification scheme that would see the Victors fitted with tip tanks, the structure modified to limit further fatigue cracking in the wings, and ejection seats provided for all six crewmembers. The Ministry of Defence delayed signing the order for conversion of the B2s until after Handley Page went into liquidation. The contract for conversion was instead awarded to Hawker Siddeley, who produced a much simpler conversion than that planned by Handley Page, with the wingspan shortened to reduce wing bending stress and hence extend airframe life.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{telescope}} was originally completed, Lovell and Husband started contemplating {{the idea of}} upgrading the telescope so {{that it had a}} more accurate surface, and was controlled by a digital computer. Plans for this upgrade were created by Husband and Co., and were presented to Lovell in April 1964. Their plans became more urgent when fatigue cracks were discovered in the elevation drive system in September 1967. The telescope was only expected to have an operational lifespan of 10 years, and Husband had been warning about the decay of the telescope since 1963. The appearance <b>of</b> <b>fatigue</b> cracks was the first of these problems that threatened to stop the telescope working; if tey had not been put right, then the elevation system could have failed and perhaps jammed. The telescope was therefore repaired and upgraded to become the Mark IA; the £400,000 of funding to do this was announced on 8 July 1968 by the SRC. The upgrade was carried out in three phases, phase 1 lasting between September 1968 and February 1969, phase 2 between September and November 1969 and phase 3 between August 1970 and November 1971.|$|E
5|$|Braham flew in {{the first}} wave. As Braham's wave reached Leeuwarden in the Netherlands and while {{four of the five}} RAF fighters made no contact, Braham {{attracted}} two enemy night fighters. The Messerschmitt Bf 110s were from IV./Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (Night Fighter Wing 1). Five had taken off under the command of Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer—who finished the war as the most successful night fighter of all time with 121 air victories. Schnaufer led his flight out toward the echo but turned back himself after engine trouble. Using his Serrate radar detector, Braham and his radar operator picked up the emissions made by the German fighters' Lichtenstein radar. He gained on and shot down Feldwebel Georg Kraft, an Experten with 15 air victories from 4./NJG 1. Kraft was killed. Another Bf 110 had witnessed the action and attempted to engage Braham but was outmanoeuvred and dispatched also. Its pilot, Feldwebel Heinz Vinke was the only member of his crew to survive. Braham considered shooting at one crew member, likely Vinke, who he had seen parachute out of the aircraft, but Bill Gregory persuaded him not to. Braham's Beaufighter was nearly struck by debris from the last victim. Braham had a habit of opening fire at very close range and the resulting disintegration of the Messerschmitt hurled debris at the closely following Beaufighter. One reason for firing at close-range was Braham's high state <b>of</b> <b>fatigue.</b> In such a state Braham could barely keep his eyes open. Whenever he peered ahead they smarted and misted.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} common signs <b>of</b> {{tiredness}} or <b>fatigue</b> is yawning. Naturally, identification <b>of</b> <b>fatigued</b> individuals would be helped if yawning is detected. Existing techniques for yawn detection are centred on measuring the mouth opening. This approach, however, may fail if the mouth is occluded by the hand, as it is frequently the case. The work presented in this paper focuses on a technique to detect yawning whilst also allowing for cases of occlusion. For measuring the mouth opening, a new technique which applies adaptive colour region is introduced. For detecting yawning whilst the mouth is occluded, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features are used to also identify facial distortions during yawning.

40|$|Background Although fatigue is a {{ubiquitous}} symptom across countries, clinical descriptions <b>of</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> syndrome {{have arisen}} from {{a limited number}} of high-income countries. This might reflect differences in true prevalence or clinical recognition influenced by sociocultural factors. Aims To compare the prevalence, physician recognition and diagnosis <b>of</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> syndrome in London and Sao Paulo. Method Primary care patients in London (n= 2459) and Sao Paulo n= 3914) were surveyed for the prevalence <b>of</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> syndrome. Medical records were reviewed for the physician recognition and diagnosis. Results The prevalence <b>of</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> syndrome according to Centers for Disease Control 1994 criteria was comparable in Britain and Brazil, 2. 1 % v. 1. 6 % (P= 0. 20).

40|$|The main {{objective}} of present bachelor thesis is to compile literature review <b>of</b> thermomechanical <b>fatigue</b> <b>of</b> nickel-based superalloys. Superalloys {{were developed to}} work at high temperatures, where sufficiently high strength, oxidation resistance, creep resistance, and resistance to other high temperature adverse effects have to be ensured.

The present review compiles basic overview of nickel-based superalloys based on specialized publications. First of all, classification of Ni-based superalloys, chemical composition, along with an overview of the most important phases, which are affecting properties of superalloys were studied in detail. The second chapter describes basics <b>of</b> isothermal <b>fatigue</b> <b>of</b> materials, its definition, description of mechanism and basic fatigue life curves.

40|$|Abstract: The {{experiments}} <b>of</b> thermal <b>fatigue</b> {{damage on}} piston {{were conducted by}} shaped high power laser. Microstructure <b>of</b> thermal <b>fatigue</b> damaged specimen was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The mechanical properties <b>of</b> thermal <b>fatigue</b> specimen were evaluated by microhardness and the corresponding damaged mechanisms were discussed. The results show that cracks originated from the interface of Al-matrix and intermetallic phase due to the thermal and mechanical mismatch between the brittle components of the microstructure and the surrounding ductile matrix. Oxides <b>of</b> thermal <b>fatigue</b> crack can accelerate the damage of piston. There exists a decline tendency in the microhardness of piston at all locations after thermal fatigue tests due to the comprehensive effects of nonequilibrium distribution of temperature and cooling method...|$|R
