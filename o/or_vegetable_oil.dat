The flavor of olive oil is generally considered too strong to be used for traditional fried chicken, and its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for use.

25|$|Despite {{attempts}} at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron adulteration, {{particularly among the}} cheapest grades, continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the Safranschou code. Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like beetroot, pomegranate fibres, red-dyed silk fibres, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and odourless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibres with viscid substances like honey <b>or</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> to increase their weight. Powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with turmeric, paprika, and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabelled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, in India, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold and mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income. Safflower is a common substitute sometimes sold as saffron. The spice is reportedly counterfeited with horse hair, corn silk, or shredded paper. Tartrazine or sunset yellow {{have been used to}} colour counterfeit powdered saffron.|$|E

2500|$|The idea {{of having}} {{anything}} which might be tainted with pig or beef fat in their mouths was unacceptable to the native soldiers, and when they objected {{it was suggested that}} they were more than welcome to make up their own batches of cartridges, using a religiously acceptable greasing agent such as ghee <b>or</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil.</b> This seemed to prove that the issued cartridges were, in fact, greased with pig and/or beef fat. A further suggestion that the sepoys tear the cartridges open with their hands (instead of biting them open) was rejected as impractical - many of the sepoys had been undertaking musket drill daily for years, and the practice of biting the cartridge open was second nature to them. Incidentally, after the Mutiny, manuals amended the method of opening the cartridge to, [...] "Bring the cartridge to the forefinger and thumb of the left hand, and with the arm close to the body, carefully tear off the end without spilling the powder." [...] The indifference of many British commanding officers to the problem perceived by the sepoys only added more fuel to the already volatile situation, and helped spark the rebellion in 1857.|$|E
2500|$|Mussels can be smoked, boiled, steamed, roasted, barbecued or fried {{in butter}} <b>or</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil.</b> As with all shellfish, except shrimp, mussels should be checked {{to ensure they}} are still alive just before they are cooked; enzymes quickly break down the meat and make them {{unpalatable}} or poisonous after dying or uncooked. Some mussels might contain toxins. A simple criterion is that live mussels, when in the air, will shut tightly when disturbed. Open, unresponsive mussels are dead, and must be discarded. Unusually heavy, wild-caught, closed mussels may be discarded as they may contain only mud or sand. (They can be tested by slightly opening the shell halves.) A thorough rinse in water and removal of [...] "the beard" [...] is suggested. Mussel shells usually open when cooked, revealing the cooked soft parts. Historically, it has been believed that after cooking all the mussels should have opened and those that have not are not safe to eat and should be discarded. However, according to marine biologist Nick Ruello, this advice may have arisen from an old, poorly researched cookbook's advice, which has now become an assumed truism for all shellfish. Ruello found 11.5% of all mussels failed to open during cooking, but when forced open, 100% were [...] "both adequately cooked and safe to eat." ...|$|E
