40|$|This {{research}} examined causal patterns among {{factors related}} to the subjective retirement of <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> persons. The data are from the National Survey of Black Americans, the first probability sample of the adult Black population. Analysis of Covariance Structures (LISREL) suggested {{a process in which}} self-defined retirement is discouraged by perceptions of a discontinuous work life, and economic and psychological need for the disabled worker role. AN important question in retirement research addressed inL this study is: Why does a large group of <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> persons, despite nonworking status, not report themselves as retired? The failure to meet this operational definition of retirement causes the group to be screened out of major retirement research. Causal patterns among factors that explain the subjective retirement of <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> Americans are identified in this study. Knowledge of such relationships will benefit both retirement research and policy in behalf of a rapidly growing group of the <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> nonworking poor...|$|R

The old exterior doors remain, generally with glass replacing the shuttered sections, except for several windows on the rear lavatories and kitchen. Air conditioners are mounted in the transoms over the doors. On the southeast corner is a large inspector's office, with a counter for public business. Some old masonry partitions had been removed or altered to create this space. Along the east side, small rooms have been partitioned off and in the rear northeast corner is the large Port Director's office, in its original configuration. Across the north rear are a men's lavatory, a women's lavatory and a kitchen, all with black and white floor tiles.

25|$|Paulding's other {{writings}} {{also include}} The Diverting History of John Bull and Brother Jonathan (1812), a satire, The Dutchman's Fireside (1831), a romance which attained popularity, a Life of Washington (1835), and some poems. In the decade before Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper achieved popular success, Paulding experimented in every genre {{in an effort}} to forge a new American literature. Thereafter, his outstanding contributions were in the novel and in a stage comedy. Koningsmarke (1823), which he began as a spoof of Walter Scott's historical romances, took unexpected hold of his imagination and became a well-turned novel, notable for its portrait of an <b>old</b> <b>black</b> woman that anticipates William Faulkner and for its sympathetic yet unromanticized depiction of the Indian. The Lion of the West (1831), selected in a play competition in which William Cullen Bryant was one of the judges, presented a cartoon of Davy Crockett; it was the most-often performed play on the American stage before Uncle Tom's Cabin, and an altered version enjoyed success in London. Paulding's View of Slavery in the United States (1836) was a comprehensive defense of both Black slavery and America's claim to be a bastian of liberty against the attacks of abolitionists and European critics.|$|E
25|$|As Philadelphia {{grew more}} industrialized the new {{factories}} refused to hire African Americans, with {{only about one}} percent of Philadelphia's African American population finding employment with the factories. In 1899 W. E. B. Du Bois said that {{ninety percent of the}} African American population in the city was below the poverty line. White-collar office jobs also refused to hire African Americans and many worked as domestic workers. There were African Americans that did manage to own their own businesses, while other became professionals such as doctors and lawyers. In 1884 Christopher J. Perry founded The Philadelphia Tribune, a newspaper for African Americans. It wasn't until World War II that factories began hiring African Americans. The Philadelphia Police Department first hired African Americans in 1881 and in the 1950s the first African American promoted to Police Captain was James N. Reaves. Reaves went on to integrate patrol car crews. During the 1950s and 60s the factories and {{a large portion of the}} white population left the city. African Americans became the city's largest ethnic group, with most of North Philadelphia, West Philadelphia, Germantown and portions of South Philadelphia becoming black neighborhoods. <b>Old</b> <b>black</b> working-class neighborhoods became ghettos filled with vacant lots and houses due to loss of industrial jobs. Starting in the 1970s African Americans began to gain significant independent political influence in city government, with the city's first African American mayor, Wilson Goode, being elected in 1984. Starting at the end of the 20th century a new wave of immigrants directly from Africa settled in the city. Coming from over thirty different countries there are an estimated 55,000 African immigrants in Philadelphia.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} whether implicit {{stereotypes of}} younger Black men as physically threatening extend to <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> men. In Experiment 1, participants categorized objects as weapons or tools, following briefly presented prime images {{of men who}} varied in age (younger, <b>older)</b> and race (<b>Black,</b> White). In Experiment 2, we used new prime images of younger and <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> and White men, and participants categorized words as threatening or safe. Results revealed robust racial biases in object and word identification, replicating prior research: Threatening stimuli were more quickly and accurately identified after Black primes, whereas non-threatening stimuli were more quickly and accurately identified after White primes. Process-dissociation analyses further indicated that these effects were entirely driven by racial biases in automatic processing. Prime age did not moderate any of these effects, suggesting that implicit threat-based racial biases commonly evoked by younger Black men appear to extend to <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> men...|$|R

40|$|Our {{ability to}} {{understand}} the status and position of current cohorts of <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> Americans must begin with {{an appreciation of the}} multiple effects of disadvantaged socioeconomic status they have endured over the course of their lives. This unique disadvantage is the result of membership in two devalued status groups, that of old age and of being Black (i. e., double jeopardy). However, in order to fully appreciate the dual effects of double jeopardy, it is necessary to examine the life experiences of <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> adults within a life course perspective. Present cohorts of <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> Americans are survivors. They were born and raised during a period of time when the rule of Òseparate and unequalÓ was enforced by Jim Crow laws and limited opportunities in diverse areas such as education, health care, housing, and the labor market. In addition, todayÕs <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> adults have had to struggle with the longer term effects of these early life experiences in their attempts to cope with poverty, unemployment, low levels of education, inadequate housing, serious health problems, and poor health care. Yet, despite these significant obstacles, <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> Americans exhibit a high degree of strength and resiliency. Older Blacks have strong kinship bonds, display a high levels of religiosity, and vote on a more frequent basis than their younger Black counterparts.

40|$|Reducing {{racial and}} ethnic disparities in {{healthcare}} are ongoing concerns. A paucity of data on healthcare seeking behavior among <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> women has hampered efforts to make culturally responsive healthcare services available to this population. Little is known about how <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> women's expectations and perceptions of care affect their patterns of health behavior. This study explored sociocultural contexts of health behavior with fifty Black women, aged 40 and older, in Tucson, Arizona by examining what prompts these women to seek services, identifying key factors affecting their access to and utilization of healthcare, documenting their experiences in healthcare settings and how these interactions influence their healthcare-seeking behavior. If effective healthcare service access and utilization are to be encouraged among <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> women, an informed {{understanding of the role}} cultural difference plays is essential. This research has three purposes: to provide a forum for discussion of culturally relevant strategies and models for prevention of disease and promotion of wellness in Black communities; to provide perspectives on <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> women's health issues for policymakers and administrators in public health sciences; and to gain insight and document reasons for selected health behaviors among this population. Research funding from the NIH/ NIA has helped to establish this small multi-disciplinary data set on a specific race, gender and age sub-population group for future research and development of community resource partnerships; including public health education and effective healthcare service delivery with intervention / promotion efforts targeting <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> women. Findings: Older Black women's poorer health status reflects the cumulative effects of inadequate health care due to various discriminatory experiences and their mistrust of the health care system. Mistrust, expectations of racial bias, perceived cultural insensitivity, and lack of effective communication within healthcare settings were found to be barriers to their healthcare-seeking behavior. Neither healthcare providers nor <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> women can address these issues alone. Working towards more trusting relationships within healthcare settings is critical in beginning to address avoidable inequities in health status experienced by <b>older</b> <b>Black</b> women. This research is applicable to such disciplines as Sociocultural/Medical Anthropology, Health Education, Public Health, and Africana/Ethnic Studies...|$|R
