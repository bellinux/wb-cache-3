40|$|This paper {{presents}} a gain-based fanout optimization algorithm for near-continuous buffer libraries. A near-continuous buffer library contains many buffers {{in a wide}} range of discrete sizes and each buffer of a specific type satisfies a size-independent delay equation. The new fanout algorithm is derived from an optimal algorithm to a special fanout optimization problem for continuous libraries. The gain-based technique constructs fanout trees which have better timing at similar area cost. Since no combinatorial search over buffer sizes or fanout tree topologies <b>is</b> used, <b>our</b> execution <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to 1000 <b>times</b> faster when compared to conventional fanout algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Block based motion {{compensation}} techniques make {{frequent use of}} Early Termination Algorithms (ETA) to reduce the computational cost of block matching process. ETAs have been well studied {{in the context of}} Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD) match measure and are effective in eliminating a large percentage of computations. As compared to SAD, the correlation coefficient (ρ) is a more robust measure but has high computational cost because no ETAs for ρ have been reported in literature. In this paper, we propose two types of ETAs for correlation coefficient: growth based and the bound based. In growth based ETA, ρ is computed as a monotonically decreasing measure. At a specific search location, when the partial value of ρ falls below the yet known maxima, remaining calculations are discarded. In bound based ETA, a new upperbound on ρ is derived which is tighter than the currently used Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. The search locations where the proposed bound falls shorter than the yet known maxima are eliminated from the search space. Both types of algorithms are implemented in a cascade and tested on a commercial video dataset. In our experiments, up to 88 % computations are found to be eliminated. In terms of execution <b>time,</b> <b>our</b> algorithm <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to 13. 7 times faster than the FFTW based implementation and up to 4. 6 times faster than the current best known spatial domain technique. 1...|$|R
