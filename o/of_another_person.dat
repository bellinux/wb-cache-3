5|$|Involuntary {{manslaughter}} {{involves the}} causing {{of the death}} <b>of</b> <b>another</b> <b>person</b> without intent to kill or intention to commit grievous bodily harm. Some cases are in form similar to murder cases; whilst, in others, had death not been caused, the defendant would only be liable for an insignificant crime.|$|E
5|$|The killing <b>of</b> <b>another</b> <b>person</b> must be unlawful. Some defences are {{therefore}} {{open to the}} defendant, among them self-defence. Carrying a lawful activity, for example, a fully qualified doctor carrying out an abortion in the required circumstances, could not result in an unlawful homicide even if the child was born alive. Consent might be relevant to some forms of homicide, but not to murder.|$|E

5|$|As with Gearbox's {{previous}} expansion pack , Blue Shift {{returns to}} the setting and events of the original game, but portrays the story through the eyes <b>of</b> <b>another</b> <b>person.</b> The protagonist in Blue Shift is a security guard, Barney Calhoun, employed by the Black Mesa Research Facility. After a scientific mishap causes Black Mesa to be invaded by aliens, Calhoun must fight his way to safety. The game received mostly positive reception. Many reviewers were critical of the short length {{of the game and}} the lack of new content, although the inclusion of a High Definition pack that upgraded the models and textures in both Blue Shift and the preceding Half-Life games was praised.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} I {{have found that}} it is {{difficult}} if not impossible to bring to consciousness <b>of</b> <b>another</b> <b>person</b> the nature of his tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.|$|E

40|$|For over a century, some courts—relying {{upon the}} {{landmark}} Supreme Court opinion in Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York v. Hillmon— have admitted one person’s intentions as evidence <b>of</b> what <b>another</b> <b>person</b> did. But Hillmon is wrong. The Supreme Court made an analytical error in its analysis. This Article seeks to expose {{and explain the}} error and therefore demonstrate {{that the state of}} mind exception to the general rule of exclusion of hearsay evidence should never support admission of one person’s stated intentions as evidence <b>of</b> what <b>another</b> <b>person</b> later did...|$|R
5|$|It is a crime, {{while in}} a {{security}} area, to consort with or {{to be found in}} the company of a person carrying or having possession of or having under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive in contravention of the offence mentioned above, if the circumstances raise a reasonable presumption that the person consorting intends or is about to act or has recently acted with the person having the item in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order. The penalty is either death or life imprisonment. It is a slightly less serious offence to be in a security area and consort with or be in the company <b>of</b> <b>another</b> <b>person</b> if it is reasonable for the person consorting to know that the other person had one of the above items. The penalty for this offence is imprisonment not exceeding ten years. If a person is carrying or has in his or her possession or under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive, there is a rebuttable presumption that the person was acting in contravention of the offence mentioned above.|$|E

25|$|Vicarious shame: {{refers to}} the {{experience}} of shame on behalf <b>of</b> <b>another</b> <b>person.</b> Individuals vary in their tendency to experience vicarious shame, which is related to neuroticism and to the tendency to experience personal shame. Extremely shame-prone people might even experience vicarious shame even to an increased degree, in other words: shame on behalf <b>of</b> <b>another</b> <b>person</b> who is already feeling shame on behalf of a third party (or possibly on behalf of the individual proper). The Dutch term for this feeling is 'plaatsvervangende schaamte', the German term is 'die Fremdscham' and in the Spanish language it is referred to as 'vergüenza ajena'.|$|E
