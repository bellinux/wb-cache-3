5|$|In 1148, Pope Eugene III {{granted the}} abbey an {{exemption}} on paying tithe for their newly acquired land and livestock.

5|$|Using {{strikes and}} other protest actions, Solidarity sought {{to force a}} change in {{government}} policies. In some cases, as in Bielsko-Biała, Solidarity managed to force corrupt officials {{of the government to}} lose their jobs. At the same time, it was careful never to use force <b>or</b> <b>violence,</b> so as to avoid giving the government any excuse to bring security forces into play. After 27 Bydgoszcz Solidarity members, including Jan Rulewski, were beaten up on March 19, a four-hour warning strike on March 27, involving around twelve million people, paralyzed the country. This was the largest strike {{in the history of the}} Eastern bloc, and it forced the government to promise an investigation into the beatings. This concession, and Wałęsa's agreement to defer further strikes, proved a setback to the movement, as the euphoria that had swept Polish society subsided. Nonetheless the Polish communist party—the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR)—had lost its total control over society.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, {{eight of}} the CPC's leaders were arrested and imprisoned under Section 98 of Canada's Criminal Code, which outlawed {{advocacy}} of force <b>or</b> <b>violence</b> to bring about political change.
