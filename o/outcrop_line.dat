40|$|Climate {{variability}} of a layered {{model of the}} ventilated thermocline is studied. Assuming the Ekman pumping is unchanged, cooling (heating) causes a southward (northward) shift of the <b>outcrop</b> <b>line</b> and thus induces a baroclinic response in the ventilated thermocline. The perturbations propagate within a characteristic cone downstream from the cooling (heating) region, defined by the two outermost characteristics streaming {{from the edge of}} the cooling (heating) region. Changes in Ekman pumping rate induce a barotropic response that propagates westward, which is a classic result obtained from the Sverdrup relation. However, if the <b>outcrop</b> <b>line</b> is nonzonal, there can be an additional baroclinic response, which propagates within the characteristic cone downstream from the source region of an Ekman pumping anomaly. 1...|$|E
40|$|East of Madagascar, {{the shallow}} “South Indian Ocean Counter Current (SICC) ” flows from {{west to east}} across the Indian Ocean against the {{direction}} of the wind-driven circulation. The SICC impinges on west Australia and enhances the sea level slope, strengthening the alongshore coastal jet: the Leeuwin Current (LC), which flows poleward along Australia. An observed transport maximum of the LC around 22 ° S can likely be attributed to this impingement of the SICC. The LC is often described as a regional coastal current that is forced by an offshore meridional density gradient or sea surface slope. However, {{little is known about the}} controls of these open-ocean gradients. The regional circulation system is embedded in the subtropical “super gyre” that connects the Indo-Pacific via the Tasman Gateway and the Indonesian passages. The Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) circulates through the Indian Ocean back into the Pacific south of Australia. This return pathway appears to be partly trapped in the upper layer north of an <b>outcrop</b> <b>line.</b> It is redirected along this <b>outcrop</b> <b>line</b> and joins the eastward flow of the SICC. To study the connection of the basin-scale and the inter-ocean-scale dynamics, we apply both an ocean general circulation model and a conceptual two-layer model. Shutdown of the ITF in the models leads to a large decrease in Leeuwin Current transport. Most of the SICC was found to then reconnect to the internal gyre circulation in the Indian Ocean.

40|$|East of Madagascar, {{wind and}} surface {{buoyancy}} fluxes reinforce each other, leading to frontogenesis, outcrop and an eastward along-front flow: the South Indian Ocean Countercurrent (SICC). In the east the Leeuwin Current (LC) {{is a unique}} eastern boundary current which flows poleward along Australia. It {{is often described as}} a regional coastal current forced by an off-shore meridional density gradient or a sea surface slope, yet little is known of the forcing and dynamics that control these open ocean meridional gadients. To complete this understanding, we make use of both an ocean general circulation model and a conceptual two-layer model. The SICC impinges on west Australia and adds to a sea level slope and a southward geostrophic coastal jet: the Leeuwin Current. The SICC and the LC are thus dynamically connected. An observed transport maximum of the LC around 22 ° S is directly related to this impingement of the SICC.

40|$|Abstract. The Eastern North Pacific Subtropical Mode Water (ESTMW) is a water mass of low {{potential}} vorticity (PV) and {{appears as a}} weak pycnostad or thermostad. Distinct from other subtropical mode waters, it forms {{in the absence of}} a deep winter mixed layer. The formation mechanism of this ESTMW is investigated using an ocean general circulation model that is forced by monthly climatological temperature, salinity, and wind stress at the sea surface. An equation based on the ventilated thermocline theory is used to diagnose the initial PV of a water mass right after its subduction. In this equation, three factors affect the initial PV: the spacing of density <b>outcrop</b> <b>lines,</b> the mixed layer depth gradient, and the vertical velocity at the bottom of mixed layer. Among them the wide spacing between <b>outcrop</b> <b>lines</b> is the most important for ESTMW’s low PV instead of the deep mixed layer, which is most important for classical mode waters. It is found that weak gradients in both sea surface temperature and salinity in the direction of mixed layer flow are important for the low PV formation. A low-salinity tongue that extends southeastward off North America is responsible for the small surface density gradient in the eastern North Pacific and contributes to the formation of the ESTMW. An additional experiment forced with observed freshwater flux demonstrates that the southward advection of fresher water from the high latitude along the eastern boundary is the cause of this low-salinity tongue. 1...|$|R

Sedimentological logs, <b>outcrop</b> <b>line</b> drawings, and paleocurrent and bedding measurements show that this outcrop belt represents a transverse section of an asymmetric fluvial point bar, which accumulated through migration of a channel 6 m deep and 70 m wide. This bar was characterized by early expansion followed by downstream accretion, which was abruptly interrupted by lacustrine deposition. The onset of downstream accretion started when the channel expanded to reach the more resistant valley wall. Sediment accreted on the downstream side of the point bar and accumulated both during bankfull discharge and overbank floods, with significant modification of the channel flow where the floodwater re-entered the main channel (i. e., riffle zone). In this zone, a secondary circulation cell triggered a shift of erosion toward the inner bank and scrolling on the downstream side of the point bar...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMonthly gridded fields {{predominantly}} {{based on}} global Argo in situ temperature and salinity data {{are used to}} analyze the density-compensated anomaly of salinity (spiciness anomaly) in the pycnocline of the subtropical and tropical Pacific Ocean between 2004 and 2011. Interannual variability in the formation, propagation and fate of spiciness anomalies are investigated. The spiciness anomalies propagate on the isopycnal surface sq = 25. 5 along the subtropical-tropical pycnocline advected by the mean currents. They reach the Pacific Western Tropics in about 5 - 6 years in the Southern Hemisphere and about 7 - 8 years in the Northern Hemisphere. Their amplitude strongly diminishes along the way and only very weak spiciness anomalies seem to reach the equator in the Western Tropics. A complex-EOF analysis of interannual salinity anomalies on sq = 25. 5 highlights two dominant modes of variability at interannual scale: i) the former shows a variability of 5 - 7 years predominant in the Northern Hemisphere, and ii) the latter displays an interannual variability of 2 to 3 years more marked in the Southern Hemisphere. The significant correlation of this second mode with ENSO index suggests that spiciness formation in the southeastern Pacific (SEP) is affected by ENSO tropical interannual variability. A diagnosis of the mechanisms governing the interannual generation of spiciness in the SEP region leads the authors to suggest that the spiciness interannual variability in the sub-surface is linked to the equatorward migration of the isopycnal <b>outcrop</b> <b>line</b> sq = 25. 5 into the area of maximum salinity.

40|$|The {{transverse}} 'Sillaro line' {{is merely}} the <b>outcrop</b> <b>line</b> of the north-west dipping overthrust plane of the Liguride Complex. The anti-Apenninic strike of this overthrust plane {{is the result of}} the 'Sillaro flexure', a large synsedimentarily developed flexure of the basement of the Northern Apennines. The Liguride Complex overlies to the north-east progressively younger deposits dating from Early Miocene to eventually Pliocene: the Liguride overthrust is tectonically transgressive. The Liguride Complex is made up largely of clay, the Argille Scagliose; the overthrusting was gravitational. Just like glaciers and ice-sheets the Liguride Complex is a plastic mass capable of spreading under the influence ofgravitation. Olistostromization played a role ofvarying importance in the advance of the Liguride Complex. During the Pliocene, when a shallow molasse basin was invaded, it was the dominating mechanism. Locally the Liguride Complex interfingers with autochthonous deposits, as a result of a temporary standstill of the thrust sheet. The deposits just below the overthrust plane often show the influence of the approaching Liguride Complex. The Marnoso Arenacea is a turbidite formation of Miocene age. The configuration of its sedimentation basin was influenced strongly by an anticline that developed synsedimentarily, resulting in the Castel Vecchio 'high'. This 'high' divided the basin into an inner and outer basin in the south-west and north-east respectively, each with its own sedimentary history. The position of the inner basin axis was defined by the Rovigo syncline, which was also synsedimentary. A 'klippe sedimentaire', the Casaglia Member, invaded the basin from the south-west, and carne to a standstill near the basin axis. It proved impossible to describe the turbidites in terms of inner and outer fan and basin plain deposits by analogy with recent turbidite sedimentation in oceanic environments. A purely descriptive classification in facies associations is introduced here. The thickest and coarsest turbidites were usually deposited in the deepest parts of the basin. Towards the 'high' they became thinner and finer grained, until only marls were deposited. Upon the Castel Vecchio 'high' moluscs are found in living position, indicating that occasionally this 'high' approached sea-level. The Castel Guerrino Formation which constitutes a separate tectonic unit, was probably deposited in a more internal part ofthe Marnoso Arenacea basin. This formation thrust from the south-west upon the Marnoso Arenacea, after which it overthrust 5 km further to the north-east over a thin slice of Liguride rocks which had already overthrust the Marnoso Areacea...|$|E

40|$|Climate {{variability}} in the subtropical gyre interior induced by anomalous surface thermal forcing, Ekman pumping, mixed layer depth variability, and anomalous subpolar water formation is examined, using a contin-uously stratified model of the ideal-fluid thermocline. Cooling (heating) induces a negative (positive) potential vorticity perturbation in the ventilated thermocline, and the associated density perturbations propagate down-stream {{in the form of}} second and higher baroclinic modes. The second baroclinic mode resembles the traditional second baroclinic mode because it has a thermal structure with cooling (warming) in the upper thermocline and warming (cooling) in the lower thermocline. Anomalous Ekman pumping can also induce density perturbations that propagate westward {{in the form of the}} first baroclinic mode. In addition, if the <b>outcrop</b> <b>lines</b> are nonzonal, there are density perturbations that propagate downstream in the form of the second or third baroclinic modes. Perturbations in the sea surface elevation are mostly confined to the region of anomalous forcing. On the other hand, when the low potential vorticity anomaly in the subpolar mode water spreads into the subtropical basin, both the unventilated and ventilated thermocline move downward. Consequently, temperature at a given depth seems to increase. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSimulation by {{a finite}} volume method of the {{transfer}} by water of radioactive elements in sites of nuclear waste storage, on large time and space scales, is the only possible way to analyze the safety of disposal. To properly represent the different pathways of radionuclides, surface topography (valleys, reliefs, rivers), geologic layers and simplified storage facilities must be accurately modeled. This paper proposes a new methodology for generating hex-dominant meshes (well suited for a finite volume formulation) of geologic structures complying with these different geometric constraints. First, a reference 2 D domain is obtained by projecting all the line constraints into a horizontal plane. Different size specifications are given for workings, <b>outcrop</b> <b>lines</b> and rivers. Using an adaptive methodology, the size variation is bounded by a specified threshold {{in order to obtain}} a high quality quad-dominant mesh. Secondly, a hex-dominant mesh of the geological medium is generated by a vertical extrusion. Depending on the configuration of the surfaces found (interfaces between two layers, top or bottom faces of underground workings), hexahedra, prisms, pyramids and tetrahedra are generated. The generation of volume elements follows a global order established on the whole set of surfaces to ensure the conformity of the resulting mesh. An example of mesh construction of a geologic structure will illustrate the suitability of the proposed methodology...|$|R
40|$|A reduced-gravity planetary-geostrophic {{model of}} the North Atlantic {{consisting}} of two active layers overlying a motionless abyss is developed to investigate {{the effect of the}} wind field in shaping the dynamics of the Mediterranean salinity tongue. The model is driven by climatological winds and eastern boundary ventilation in a basin of realistic geometry and includes a parameterization of meddies. The upper-layer depth from the model shows a clear similarity to observations, both in terms of the location and intensity of the subtropical gyre and also the position of the <b>outcropping</b> <b>line</b> in the northern basin. Potential vorticity in layer two reproduces the sweep of potential-vorticity contours southwestward from the eastern boundary and extending westward into the interior, and provides the pathways along which Mediterranean Water spreads into the model interior. The authors solve for the steady salinity field in the second layer, including sources of Upper Labrador Sea Water and Antarctic Intermediate Water on the isopycnal surface. The shape and spreading latitude of the model salinity tongues bear a striking resemblance to observations. Both the wind forcing and the occurrence of a mean transport of Mediterranean Water away from the eastern boundary are crucial in obtaining a realistic salinity tongue. The salinity tongues are remarkably stable to variations in the Peclet number. A simple parameterization of meddies in the model is also included. Where meddies are dissipated locally by collisions with topographic seamounts, for example, they may generate large recirculations extending across to the western boundary. The net effect of these recirculations is to shift the salinity tongue equatorward...|$|R
