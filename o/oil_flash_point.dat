40|$|Flammability is an {{important}} factor of safe practices for handling and storage of liquid mixtures and for the evaluation of the precise level of risk. <b>Flash</b> <b>point</b> is a major property used to determine the fire and explosion hazards of a liquid, and it is defined as the minimum temperature at which the vapor present over the liquid at equilibrium forms a flammable mixture when mixed with air. Experimental tests for the complete composition range of a mixture are time consuming, whereas a mixture <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> can be estimated using a computational method and available information. The information needed for mixture <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> predictions are flashpoints, vapor pressures, and activity coefficients as functions of temperature for each mixture component. Generally, sufficient experimental data are unavailable and other ways of determining the basic information are needed. A procedure to evaluate the <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> of binary mixtures is proposed, which provides techniques {{that can be used to}} estimate a parameter that is needed for binary mixture <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> evaluations. Minimum <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> behavior (MFPB) is exhibited when the <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> of the mixture is below the <b>flash</b> <b>points</b> of the individual components of the mixture.

Since boiling point data {{are often not}} available, application of molecular-similarity methods for the estimation of <b>flash</b> <b>points</b> of query compounds from <b>flash</b> <b>points</b> of structurally related source compounds in a database have been explored. Relationships, called quantitative source-target differences (QSTDs), that allow the estimation of a query (new target) from database compounds (source com-pounds) have been developed. For example, the QSTD relationship, TffR 4 Geg=C = 19 : 0474 + 0 : 9149 TffR 4 Sig=C (m = 13; r = 0 : 9832); allows the estimation of the <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> (Tf) of a Ge-organic compound from the known <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> of the analogous compound that contains a Si atom instead of a Ge atom, but otherwise has the same molecular structure as the query.
