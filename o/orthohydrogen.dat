Properties, Uses, Applications: Hydrogen Gas and Liquid Hydrogen|publisher=Universal Industrial Gases, Inc.|accessdate=5 February 2008}} In the <b>orthohydrogen</b> form, the spins {{of the two}} protons are parallel and form a triplet state with a molecular spin quantum number of 1 (+); in the parahydrogen form the spins are antiparallel and form a singlet with a molecular spin quantum number of 0 (–). At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen gas contains about 25% of the para form and 75% of the ortho form, {{also known as the}} [...] "normal form". The equilibrium ratio of <b>orthohydrogen</b> to parahydrogen depends on temperature, but because the ortho form is an excited state and has a higher energy than the para form, it is unstable and cannot be purified. At very low temperatures, the equilibrium state is composed almost exclusively of the para form. The liquid and gas phase thermal properties of pure parahydrogen differ significantly from those of the normal form because of differences in rotational heat capacities, as discussed more fully in spin isomers of hydrogen. The ortho/para distinction also occurs in other hydrogen-containing molecules or functional groups, such as water and methylene, but is of little significance for their thermal properties.|$|E

The {{synthesis}} and {{characterization of}} a series of inorganic coordination compounds which, upon crystallization, have the ability to include solvent or guest molecules spatially within the lattice are reported. The compounds have the following general formula: [NiX 2 B 4] - where X is isothiocyanate or bromine and B is 4 -ethylpyridine, 4 -vinylpiridine or 3, 5 -dimethylpyridine; [NiX 2 B 2]n - where X is isothiocyanate, B is 2 -aminopyridine and n indicates it is a polymer; [NiX 2 AB 2] 2 - where X is isothiocyanate, B is 3 -aminopyridine (two of these four ligands in the dimer are bridging) and A is water. The various guest molecules have been carefully chosen, according to their point symmetry, which is a key factor in yielding structures of a particular type. The structures of seventeen compounds have been elucidated by single crystal x-ray analysis. The difficulty has been found to lie in refining disordered guest molecules. Other techniques employed in the initial characterization of these compounds are Microanalysis, Mass Spectrometry and UV/Visible Spectrophotometry. An intramolecular potential energy study on the [Ni(NCS) 2 (3, 5 -diMepy) 4] complex reveals that the <b>orthohydrogens</b> on the 3, 5 -dimethylpyridine ligands control the conformation of the molecule. Packing densities and volume comparisons of the [Ni(NCS) 2 (4 -Etpy) 4] and [Ni(NCS) 2 (4 -Vipy) 4] complexes and their clathrates have been carried out. The exact sizes and shapes of the cavities in which the guest molecules are located in the x-ray crystal structures have been evaluated by both intermolecular potential energy and molecular volume calculations. Thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties of the [Ni(NCS) 2 (4 -Etpy) 4] and [Ni(NCS) 2 (4 -Vipy) 4] clathrates have been studied in both solution and the solid state. The techniques used are x-ray powder diffractometry, IR spectroscopy and Thermogravimetry (including Differential Thermal Analysis) ...|$|R
50|$|However, <b>orthohydrogen</b> is {{thermodynamically}} unstable at {{low temperatures}} and spontaneously converts into parahydrogen. This process lacks any natural de-excitation radiation mode, {{so it is}} slow {{in the absence of}} a catalyst which can facilitate interconversion of the singlet and triplet spin states. At room temperature, hydrogen contains 75% <b>orthohydrogen,</b> a proportion which the liquefaction process preserves if carried out {{in the absence of a}} catalyst like ferric oxide, activated carbon, platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds,chromic oxide, or some nickel compounds to accelerate the conversion of the liquid hydrogen into parahydrogen. Alternatively, additional refrigeration equipment can be used to slowly absorb the heat that the <b>orthohydrogen</b> fraction will (more slowly) release as it spontaneously converts into parahydrogen. If <b>orthohydrogen</b> is not removed from rapidly liquified hydrogen, without a catalyst, the heat released during its decay can boil off as much as 50% of the original liquid.|$|E
5000|$|This is the T = 0 {{intercept}} {{seen in the}} molar {{energy of}} <b>orthohydrogen.</b> Since [...] "normal" [...] room-temperature hydrogen is a 3:1 ortho:para mixture, its molar residual rotational energy at low temperature is (3/4) x 2Rθrot = 1091 J/mol, which is somewhat larger than the enthalpy of vaporization of normal hydrogen, 904 J/mol at the boiling point, Tb = 20.369 K. Notably, the boiling points of parahydrogen and normal (3:1) hydrogen are nearly equal; for parahydrogen ∆Hvap = 898 J/mol at Tb = 20.277 K, and it follows that nearly all the residual rotational energy of <b>orthohydrogen</b> is retained in the liquid state.|$|E

50|$|Room-temperature {{hydrogen}} consists {{mostly of}} the <b>orthohydrogen</b> form. After production, liquid hydrogen is in a metastable state {{and must be}} converted into the parahydrogen isomer form to avoid the exothermic reaction that occurs when it changes at low temperatures; this is usually performed using a catalyst like iron(III) oxide, activated carbon, platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds,chromium(III) oxide, or some nickel compounds.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} a nuclear {{magnetic}} transition degree of freedom which is of importance to heat capacity, is the transition which converts the spin isomers of hydrogen gas (H2) into each other. At room temperature, the proton spins of hydrogen gas are aligned 75% of the time, resulting in <b>orthohydrogen</b> when they are. Thus, some thermal energy has been stored {{in the degree of}} freedom available when parahydrogen (in which spins are anti-aligned) absorbs energy, and is converted to the higher energy ortho form. However, at the temperature of liquid hydrogen, not enough heat energy is available to produce <b>orthohydrogen</b> (that is, the transition energy between forms is large enough to [...] "freeze out" [...] at this low temperature), and thus the parahydrogen form predominates. The heat capacity of the transition is sufficient to release enough heat, as <b>orthohydrogen</b> converts to the lower-energy parahydrogen, to boil the hydrogen liquid to gas again, if this evolved heat is not removed with a catalyst after the gas has been cooled and condensed. This example also illustrates the fact that some modes of storage of heat may not be in constant equilibrium with each other in substances, and heat absorbed or released from such phase changes may [...] "catch up" [...] with temperature changes of substances, only after a certain time. In other words, the heat evolved and absorbed from the ortho-para isomeric transition contributes to the heat capacity of hydrogen on long time-scales, but not on short time-scales. These time scales may also depend on the presence of a catalyst.|$|E

40|$|We report {{observation}} of two-photon emission from coherently excited vibrational state of solid parahydrogen, {{known as one}} of quantum solids. The coherent state between the ground and the excited states is prepared by stimulated Raman scattering using two visible laser pulses. The two-photon emission is triggered by another mid-infrared laser pulse. The observed two-photon emission persists even when the trigger pulse is injected long after the excitation. The observed phenomenon is due to a long decoherence time of the vibrational states of solid parahydrogen, which is attributed to special nature as quantum solid. Dependence of the decoherence on target temperature and residual <b>orthohydrogen</b> concentration are studied along with its time evolution. It is found that the emission intensity increases even after the excitation pulses pass through the target completely. The coherence development is highly suppressed at high target temperature and high residual <b>orthohydrogen</b> concentration.

At a temperature of 1. 5 K, as the total number N of molecules in the cluster increases, the chemical potential and the rotational energy of the clusters attain local minima at the same geometrically determined values of N (the magic numbers). The ortho-molecules exhibit a larger probability (compared to the para-molecules) to reside in the central region of the cluster and a smaller probability to be located near its surface.

40|$|Liquid {{hydrogen}} is a dense Bose fluid whose equilibrium properties are both calculable from first principles using various theoretical approaches and {{of interest for}} the understanding {{of a wide range}} of questions in many body physics. Unfortunately, the pair correlation function g(r) inferred from neutron scattering measurements of the differential cross section dσ dΩ from different measurements reported in the literature are inconsistent. We have measured the energy dependence of the total cross section and the scattering cross section for slow neutrons with energies between 0. 43 meV and 16. 1 meV on liquid hydrogen at 15. 6 K (which is dominated by the parahydrogen component) using neutron transmission measurements on the hydrogen target of the NPDGamma collaboration at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The relationship between the neutron transmission measurement we perform and the total cross section is unambiguous, and the energy range accesses length scales where the pair correlation function is rapidly varying. At 1 meV our measurement is a factor of 3 below the data from previous work. We present evidence that these previous measurements of the hydrogen cross section, which assumed that the equilibrium value for the ratio of <b>orthohydrogen</b> and parahydrogen has been reached in the target liquid, were in fact contaminated with an extra non-equilibrium component of <b>orthohydrogen.</b> Liquid para{{hydrogen is}} also a widely-used neutron moderator medium, and an accurate knowledge of its slow neutron cross section is essential for the design and optimization of intense slow neutron sources.

40|$|One of the {{problems}} faced by engineers in using the hydrogen molecule for industry (e. g., aerospace, future vehicles) concerns the storage of liquid hydrogen, where special procedures are required to keep the composition (proportion) of {{the two types of}} hydrogen molecules known as <b>orthohydrogen</b> (o-H 2) and parahydrogen (p-H 2). Without these procedures, o-H 2 in the storage tanks slowly convert to p-H 2 over a period of days or weeks, releasing enough heat to evaporate most of the liquid. In order to limit the boil-off to low levels, it is necessary to fill the tank with liquid hydrogen that has already been converted to an equilibrium composition close to 100 % p-H 2. Thus, a method to increase the o-p H 2 conversion yield is important in liquid hydrogen storage [1 - 2].

As subsystem of {{the target}} station the moderators {{play a vital role}} by slowing down high energy neutrons set free during the spallation process. To provide maximum neutron flux intensities with high availability for scattering experiments a conceptual liquid hydrogen moderator cooling circulation design proposal was developed. Supercritical hydrogen at 17 K will be utilized to absorb energy of the incoming neutrons in two parallel moderator vessels. A helium refrigerator provides the necessary cooling capacity by implementing an additional helium expansion turbine downstream the refrigerator coldbox. Strategies for the mitigation of pressure fluctuations due to beam trips are being presented. Solutions in form of electrical heaters and an accumulator or an expansion vessel are discussed. Different supercritical hydrogen circulator implementation scenarios are being matched to indicate the most reliable setup. For an efficient moderation process parahydrogen concentrations higher than 99 % have to be guaranteed at the moderator inlet. Due to potential conversion of parahydrogen to <b>orthohydrogen</b> via irradiation processes the implementation of an ortho-parahydrogen catalyst bed is being evaluated.

Generally those studies consider different (i) working conditions, (ii) operational unit performances and (iii) thermodynamic models, making it difficult to compare their results. The present work focuses specifically on the third issue by assessing the influence of the thermodynamic modeling of the fluid on the simulation outcomes. Numerical approaches to compute the heat capacities as well as the equations of state of hydrogen forms (<b>orthohydrogen</b> and parahydrogen) and their mixtures (equilibrium-hydrogen and normal-hydrogen) are described here. The attention is on equilibrium-hydrogen because the ortho-to-para conversion, which is naturally slow and largely exothermic, is to be catalytically promoted during liquefaction {{in order to reduce the}} liquefaction work compared to batch conversion. Because to the knowledge of the authors no commercial code comprises equilibrium-hydrogen, a fluid file for REFPROP is developed and used as a reference case for comparison against four other modeling alternatives that can be readily executed with commercial codes. The comparison is based on the analysis of the cooling curves, which are temperature profiles as functions of specific enthalpies, employed to calculate the ideal liquefaction work and estimate the real one. The results indicate that the choice of the heat capacity model is crucial for the accurate simulation of the overall process, whereas the choice of the equation of state is of minor importance for the overall process, but turns crucial for analyzing local processes and for the dimensioning of the operational units, like turbomachines, that are influenced by volume flows...|$|E
