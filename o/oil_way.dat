40|$|Abstract. When the multi-disk clutch is in {{disengaged}} operation, {{friction plates}} and mating plates may not separate absolutely, {{in order to}} avoid the slipping friction and reduce the clutch’s overheating, the lubricant pressure between the plates should distribute equably in design. Based on the fluid dynamic theory, the 3 -D fluid models of <b>oil</b> <b>way</b> with different diameters of squirt hole are established, with which the fluid field at different velocities and temperatures of lubricant can be analyzed. The distribution of lubricant pressure in the clearance of plates influenced by the diameter of squirt hole, inlet velocity and lubricant temperature can be studied. The result of the study shows that the bigger the squirt hole, the smaller the inlet flow and the lower the temperature is, the more uniform the lubricant pressure distributes...|$|E

The redesigned camshafts were lightened and used internal <b>oil</b> <b>ways</b> to lubricate journals that, when combined with reduced tappet clearance, provided less friction and created less engine noise. The gearbox received a taller first gear, a hollow chrome-moly shift-shaft with an additional bearing and a completely redesigned shift linkage and foot pedal. These changes were aimed at eliminating problems with the transmission in earlier models, and to help to seamlessly transfer the bike's power to the road.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} common types of cold chisels. These are the flat chisel, {{the most widely}} known type, {{which is used to}} cut bars and rods to reduce {{surfaces}} and to cut sheet metal that is too thick or difficult to cut with tin snips. The cross cut chisel is used for cutting grooves and slots. The blade narrows behind the cutting edge to provide clearance. The round nose chisel is used for cutting semi-circular grooves for <b>oil</b> <b>ways</b> in bearings. The diamond point chisel is used for cleaning out corners or difficult places and pulling over centre punch marks wrongly placed for drilling.|$|R

50|$|Both gas {{and liquid}} {{lubricants}} can transfer heat. However, liquid lubricants {{are much more}} effective on account of their high specific heat capacity. Typically the liquid lubricant is constantly circulated to and from a cooler part of the system, although lubricants {{may be used to}} warm as well as to cool when a regulated temperature is required. This circulating flow also determines the amount of heat that is carried away in any given unit of time. High flow systems can carry away a lot of heat and have the additional benefit of reducing the thermal stress on the lubricant. Thus lower cost liquid lubricants may be used. The primary drawback is that high flows typically require larger sumps and bigger cooling units. A secondary drawback is that a high flow system that relies on the flow rate to protect the lubricant from thermal stress is susceptible to catastrophic failure during sudden system shut downs. An automotive oil-cooled turbocharger is a typical example. Turbochargers get red hot during operation and the oil that is cooling them only survives as its residence time in the system is very short (i.e. high flow rate). If the system is shut down suddenly (pulling into a service area after a high-speed drive and stopping the engine) the oil that is in the turbo charger immediately oxidizes and will clog the <b>oil</b> <b>ways</b> with deposits. Over time these deposits can completely block the <b>oil</b> <b>ways,</b> reducing the cooling with the result that the turbo charger experiences total failure, typically with seized bearings. Non-flowing lubricants such as greases and pastes are not effective at heat transfer although they do contribute by reducing the generation of heat in the first place.|$|R

5000|$|The {{two halves}} of the bearing are then split at the shim, the oil holes cleared of metal and <b>oil</b> <b>ways</b> are cut into {{the surface of the}} new bearing. The shaft is smeared with engineer's blue and rotated in the bearing. When the bearing is {{disassembled}} the blue fills the hollows and is rubbed off the high spots. The high spots are scraped down, and the process repeated, until a uniform and evenly distributed pattern of blue shows when the shaft is removed. The bearing is then cleaned and lubricated, and shimmed up such that the shaft is held firmly but not binding in the bearing. The bearing is then [...] "run in" [...] by being run heavily lubricated at low load and revolution, completing the process of exposing the hard bearing surface. After final adjustment of the shimming, a very reliable and high load capability bearing results.|$|R

While nearly all motor oils can act as adequate cutting fluids in terms of their cutting performance alone, modern multi-weight motor oils with detergents and other additives are best avoided.

50|$|Recognising {{that the}} pumping station might quickly deteriorate, {{once it was}} no longer used, the Papplewick Pumping Station Trust was formed in 1974, and {{negotiated}} with Nottingham City Council. They obtained a lease which enabled them to open the site as a static museum. Once volunteers started to maintain the site, the idea of steaming the engines was voiced, and a second organisation, the Papplewick Association, was created, with responsibility for operating the machinery. One boiler was certified to be safe in 1975, and work started on refurbishing it. The cooling pond was dry and had to be cleared of leaves and pine needles before refilling could begin on 12 July. There were problems with draughting, and a fan was fitted into the flue. The boiler was lit on 18 September, and this time there were problems with smoke filling the smithy, which required further minor modifications. Steam was raised on 20 September, and the first attempt to run one engine was made the following day, with John Thorlby, who had been superintendent of the pumping station until his retirement, demonstrating the start-up procedure. The boiler feed-pump glands had to be repacked, and the camshaft had to be stripped down to clear the <b>oil</b> <b>ways,</b> but after attention to these items, the engine ran satisfactorily. The second engine was made operational at a later date.|$|R
