5|$|NATO had decided, {{under the}} impetus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration,</b> to deploy Pershing II and cruise {{missiles}} in West Germany. This deployment would have placed missiles just 6–10 minutes striking distance from Moscow. Support for the deployment was wavering {{and it looked}} doubtful {{that it would be}} carried out. When the Soviet Union shot down Flight 007, the U.S. was able to galvanize enough support at home and abroad to enable the deployment to go ahead.|$|E

5|$|At this point, McCain's {{politics}} were mainly {{in line with}} President Ronald Reagan; this included support for Reaganomics, and he was active on Indian Affairs bills. He supported most aspects of the foreign policy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration,</b> including its hardline stance against the Soviet Union and policy towards Central American conflicts, such as backing the Contras in Nicaragua. McCain opposed keeping U.S. Marines deployed in Lebanon citing unattainable objectives, and subsequently criticized President Reagan for pulling out the troops too late; in the interim, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing killed hundreds. McCain won re-election to the House easily in 1984, and gained {{a spot on the}} House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1985, he made his first return trip to Vietnam, and also traveled to Chile where he met with its military junta ruler, General Augusto Pinochet.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy easily {{defeated}} Republican businessman Ray Shamie to win {{re-election in}} 1982. Senate leaders granted him {{a seat on}} the Armed Services Committee, while allowing him to keep his other major seats despite the traditional limit of two such seats. Kennedy became very visible in opposing aspects of the foreign policy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration,</b> including U.S. intervention in the Salvadoran Civil War and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in opposing Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and the Strategic Defense Initiative. Kennedy became the Senate's leading advocate for a nuclear freeze and was a critic of Reagan's confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union. A 1983 memorandum from KGB chairman Viktor Chebrikov to general secretary Yuri Andropov noted this stance and asserted that Kennedy, through former Senator John Tunney's discussions with Soviet contacts, had suggested that U.S.-Soviet relations might be improved if Kennedy and Andropov could meet in person to discuss arms control issues and if top Soviet officials, via Kennedy's help, were able to address the American public through the U.S. news media. Andropov was unimpressed by the idea.|$|E

2500|$|This article {{discusses}} <b>the</b> {{domestic policy}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ronald <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration</b> from 1981 to 1989. Reagan's policies stressed conservative economic values, starting with his implementation of supply-side economic policies, dubbed as [...] "Reaganomics" [...] by both supporters and detractors. His policies also included the largest {{tax cut in}} American history as well as increased defense spending {{as part of his}} Soviet strategy. However, he significantly raised taxes four times due to economic conditions and reforms, but the tax reforms instituted during presidency brought top marginal rates to their lowest levels since 1931, such that by 1988, the top US marginal tax rate was 28%.|$|R
25|$|According to King, LaRouche's {{associates}} had {{for some}} years {{been in contact with}} members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration</b> about LaRouche's space-based weapons ideas. LaRouche proposed the development of defensive beam technologies as a policy that was in the interest of both the US and the USSR, as the alternative to an arms race in offensive weapons, and as a generator of spin-off economic benefits. Between February 1982 and February 1983, with the approval of the National Security Council, LaRouche met with Soviet embassy representative Evgeny Shershnev to discuss the proposal. During this period, Soviet economists also began to study LaRouche's economic forecasting model. However, following Reagan's public announcement of the SDI in March 1983, Soviet representatives broke off all contact with LaRouche and his representatives.|$|E
25|$|After a 1976 {{report by}} the United States National Academy of Sciences {{concluded}} that credible scientific evidence supported the ozone depletion hypothesis a few countries, including the United States, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, moved to eliminate the use of CFCs in aerosol spray cans. At the time this was widely regarded {{as a first step}} towards a more comprehensive regulation policy, but progress in this direction slowed in subsequent years, due to a combination of political factors (continued resistance from the halocarbon industry and a general change in attitude towards environmental regulation during the first two years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration)</b> and scientific developments (subsequent National Academy assessments that indicated that the first estimates of the magnitude of ozone depletion had been overly large).|$|E
25|$|Upon {{learning}} of the hijacking {{and that there were}} Americans on board, members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration</b> in Washington D.C. (in a time zone seven hours earlier than Egypt) moved to take decisive action. The Terrorist Incident Working Group (which included National Security Council staff member Marine Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North) met in accord with predetermined counter-terrorist procedures. They recommended that a State Department Emergency Support Team be sent to Rome to assist the embassy there as the vessel was Italian. The Group also recommended that the Pentagon dispatch a team of special operations forces to Europe in case the ship needed to be seized to rescue the hostages. These recommendations were approved by the Operational Sub-Group chaired by John Poindexter and orders were sent to the State and Defense Departments. U.S. Army Major General Carl Stiner put two platoons, drawn from the Navy's counter-terrorism unit, SEAL Team Six and Army commandos from Delta Force, en route to Europe to be operating with NATO ally permission from a British base at Akrotiri, Cyprus. The U.S. State Department asked countries along the Mediterranean to deny Achille Lauro access to their ports in order to keep it in International Waters. They also sought to keep the press away from the ship to prevent giving the terrorists a worldwide stage.|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} is made between <b>the</b> records <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> and Thatcher <b>administrations</b> {{in their efforts}} to reform, respectively, the social security program in the United States and the retirement pension program in the United Kingdom. It is found that <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration</b> was much less successful in attaining its reform agenda than was the Thatcher government. The discrepancies in <b>the</b> records <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two administrations were traced to four central factors: (1) <b>the</b> reform strategy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two governments; (2) <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elderly lobby in the two countries; (3) <b>the</b> legacy <b>of</b> past policy; (4) institutional structure. ...|$|R
50|$|He was a Senior Fellow and {{director}} of International Studies at the Hoover Institution. In 1980 he participated in the Citizens' Advisory Council on National Space Policy which wrote the space strategy policy for <b>the</b> transition team <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incoming <b>Reagan</b> <b>Administration.</b> <b>The</b> Council, which included General Daniel O. Graham, advocated <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> anti-ballistic missile systems, including space-based defense weapons, ground laser systems with mirrors in orbit, and nuclear defensive weapons to intercept massive multiple ICBM attacks. In this position he helped to influence Ronald Reagan, who in 1983 initiated <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> such a system, the Strategic Defense Initiative. In 1982, Possony was a cofounder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> International Strategic Studies Association.|$|R

40|$|In {{attempting}} {{to revitalize the}} Environmental Protection Agency after <b>the</b> debacle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration,</b> William Ruckleshaus called for increasing professionalism of environmental management through <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> risk assessment methods. He stressed science over politics and urged professionalism up to <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> political decisions (which must balance values). In an ideal world, these risk assessors would delimit, analyze, and set out <b>the</b> implications <b>of</b> each decision. As faceless scientists, they could be moved among jobs with {{little effect on the}} decisions or their implementation. However, as Graham, Green, and Roberts demonstrate in In Search <b>of</b> Safety, <b>the</b> scientific foundation <b>of</b> risk assessment is too weak to eliminate important scientific disagreement.

25|$|Despite <b>the</b> return <b>of</b> Indira Gandhi {{to power}} in 1980, the {{relations}} between the two countries continued to improve gradually, although India did not support the United States in its role in the Soviet invasion and occupation <b>of</b> Afghanistan. <b>The</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>Administration</b> provided limited assistance to India. India sounded out Washington on <b>the</b> purchase <b>of</b> a range of US defence technology, including F-5 aircraft, super computers, night vision goggles and radars. In 1984 Washington approved <b>the</b> supply <b>of</b> selected technology to India including gas turbines for naval frigates and engines for prototypes for India’s light combat aircraft. There were also unpublicised transfers <b>of</b> technology, including <b>the</b> engagement <b>of</b> a US company, Continental Electronics, to design and build a new VLF communications station at Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu, which was commissioned in the late 1980s. However, it was not until the late 1990s that there was a significant effort by both countries to improve relations with each other.|$|R
500|$|He {{joined the}} Los Angeles Times in 1964 {{where he spent}} the next four decades until he retired.

500|$|In January 1987, Paul officially {{left the}} Republican Party [...] {{to run for}} the Libertarian Party {{nomination}} after becoming disillusioned by the spending policies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration</b> and presumptive Republican presidential nominee George H.W.

500|$|The Iran–Contra affair ( [...] , [...] ), also {{referred}} to as Irangate, Contragate or the Iran–Contra scandal, was a political scandal in the United States that occurred during the second term <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>Administration.</b> Senior administration officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to Iran, which was the subject of an arms embargo. They hoped, thereby, to fund the Contras in Nicaragua {{while at the same time}} negotiating the release of several U.S. hostages. Under the Boland Amendment, further funding of the Contras by the government had been prohibited by Congress.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, {{he joined}} <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration.</b> From 1981 to 1982, {{he served as}} Assistant Secretary <b>of</b> Education for <b>the</b> Office for Civil Rights in <b>the</b> U.S. Department <b>of</b> Education. From 1982 to 1990, he was Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). Journalist Evan Thomas {{characterized}} Thomas as [...] "openly ambitious for higher office" [...] during his tenure at the EEOC. As Chairman, he promoted a doctrine of self-reliance, and halted the usual EEOC approach of filing class-action discrimination lawsuits, instead pursuing acts of individual discrimination. He also asserted in 1984 that black leaders were [...] "watching <b>the</b> destruction <b>of</b> our race" [...] as they [...] "bitch, bitch, bitch" [...] about President Reagan instead <b>of</b> working with <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration</b> to alleviate teenage pregnancy, unemployment and illiteracy.|$|R
40|$|Following <b>the</b> Iranian Revolution <b>of</b> 1979, Iraq invaded Iran {{resulting}} in a costly war from 1980 to 1988, which threatened American interests in the Persian Gulf.

The war had provided the United States with an opportunity to improve relations with Iraq, particularly alter Iran reversed the Iraqi invasion in <b>the</b> summer <b>of</b> 1982. Because <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration</b> could not let Iraq collapse, the United States tilted heavily towards Iraq in defiance of its stated policy. Interestingly, the tilt towards Iraq did not stop <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration</b> from secretly dealing with Iran in 1985. Consequently, <b>the</b> disclosure <b>of</b> these dealings resulted in <b>the</b> buildup <b>of</b> American naval forces in the region to protect <b>the</b> shipment <b>of</b> oil, and eventually <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> force to end the conflict in 1988...|$|R
