Club records announced in November 2012 revealed that gross debt had fallen to £359.7million after the share sale paid off £62.6million of bonds. The club's debts were further remedied in May 2013, after a new loan deal was agreed that would save the club £10million a year in interest payments on debts now totalling around £307million.|$|E

2500|$|The {{market for}} {{corporate}} control, where parties compete to buy controlling stakes in companies, {{is seen by}} some as an important, although perhaps limited, mechanism for the board of directors' accountability. Because individual shareholders {{may not be as}} likely to act collectively as a majority shareholder, the threat of a takeover when a company share price drops, heightens the prospect that a director is removed from office by an ordinary resolution under CA 2006 section 168. Since 1959 the UK has taken the approach that directors, particularly of public companies, should do nothing with the effect of frustrating a takeover bid, unless shareholders approve it by a majority {{at the time of the}} takeover. Rule 21 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers consolidates this now. Typical takeover defence tactics, routinely found in US corporate law, led by Delaware, include issuing extra shares to everyone but a takeover bidder to dilute their stake unless the bidder has the board's consent to buy shareholders' shares (a [...] "poison pill"), paying a takeover bidder to go away ("greenmail"), merely selling a key company asset to a friendly third party, or engaging in large share buyback schemes. In the US, defensive tactics must merely be employed in good faith, and be proportionate to the threat posed with regard to factors like the <b>offer</b> <b>price,</b> timing and effect on the company's stakeholders. Moreover, Delaware directors can often only be removed for a [...] "good reason" [...] (fought out in court) with a board classified into directors a third of whom will be removable in any given year. This makes hostile takeovers very difficult, unless a bidder promises the incumbent board large golden parachutes in return for their consent. After much debate, the EU's newly implemented Takeover Directive decided to leave member states the option under articles 9 and 12 of whether to mandate that boards remain [...] "neutral".|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{describe}} two sales {{strategies used}} by the MinneTACagent for the 2003 Supply Chain Management Trading Agent Competition. Both strategies estimate, as the gameprogresses, the probability of receiving a customer order for different <b>offer</b> <b>prices.</b> <b>Offers</b> are made to maximize the ex-pected profit margin on each order. The main difference between the strategies is in how they compute the probabilityof receiving an order and the <b>offer</b> <b>prices.</b> The first strategy works well in high-demand games, the second was de-signed to improve performance in low-demand games. We analyze empirically {{the effect of the}} discount given by sup-pliers on orders received {{the first day of the}} game, and we show that in high-demand games there is a correlation be-tween the offers an agent receives from suppliers the first day of the game and the agent's performance in the game...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{documented}} the reversal {{in the initial}} returns of REIT IPOs from overpricing in the 1980 s to underpricing in the 1990 s. We find that the gross spreads of REIT IPOs decreased significantly in the 1990 s. In particular, there is a bimodal clustering for gross spreads at 6. 5 and 7. 0 %. Moreover, in the 1980 s around 94 % of REIT IPOs had integer <b>offer</b> <b>prices,</b> {{most of which were}} priced at either $ 10 or $ 20. However, the proportion of integer <b>offer</b> <b>prices</b> decreased to 64 % in the 1990 s. Higher gross spreads, overpricing, and high frequency of integer <b>offer</b> <b>prices</b> for REIT IPOs in the 1980 s are consistent with the marketing hypothesis that in the 1980 s REIT IPOs were mainly marketed to less-informed individual investors. Our results explain the dynamic process employed by underwriters in the setting of gross spreads and the pricing of REIT IPOs as a new financial product in response to various structural changes in REITs.

We {{also want}} to thank Alexander Ljungqvist for {{supplying}} us with information on SDC New Issues file errors. Venture capital investments by IPO underwriters: Certification or conflict of interest? We study IPO pricing when underwriters are venture capital investors in issuers and evaluate whether this creates a serious conflict of interest with IPO investors or reduces the conflict of interest with IPO issuers. Theoretically, prior underwriter venture investment has several effects. First, it can improve underwriter access to IPO issuer information, thereby enhancing the credibility of due diligence investigations, which raises investor demand and IPO <b>offer</b> <b>prices.</b> Second, it can increase an underwriter’s conflict of interest with IPO investors, which decreases the credibility of its due diligence investigatio n, lowering investor demand and IPO <b>offer</b> <b>prices</b> when prices are set competitively. Third, it improves the alignment of interest of underwriters and IPO issuers, which results in higher IPO <b>offer</b> <b>prices,</b> if underwriters have some pricing power and capture rents from allocating underpriced issues. Empirically, venture capital investments by lead underwriters significantly reduce IPO underpricing, while venture investments by other syndicate underwriters have no effect.
