40|$|In this paper, a {{purpose-built}} apparatus {{was used}} to analyze the moisture liberation <b>of</b> textile <b>fabrics.</b> Fabrics were wetted and placed in an air-conditioned room to test the variation of weight and surface temperature during the process of moisture liberation. Effects of textile materials and fabric structures on the velocities of moisture liberation <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> were analyzed; the temperature variation and its relationship with moisture regains <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> in the moisture liberation were also studied. Moisture liberation velocities of polyester and silk fabrics are much higher than that of wool and cotton fabrics. For the same textile materials, knitted fabrics absorbed more water and thus took longer time to liberate the water. The surface temperature <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> showed three stages during moisture liberation. With the decrease <b>of</b> moisture regain, <b>fabric</b> temperature decreased gradually and jumped quickly to ambient temperature. In this way we could evaluate the moisture desorption <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> and develop quick-drying fabrics with improved moisture and thermal properties. ...|$|R

40|$|Temperature control <b>of</b> thermal <b>fabrics</b> has {{recently}} become {{a topic of}} interest. It was reported that the electrical resistance <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> embedded with conducting yarns can be affected by temperature change. In this paper the quantitative relationship between electrical resistance of a conductive knitted fabric and temperature was established. Based on this relationship, a theoretical model was proposed to control the temperature <b>of</b> conductive knitted <b>fabrics</b> in different courses and different wales. One important parameter <b>of</b> <b>fabrics,</b> which reflects how the electrical resistance <b>of</b> a <b>fabric</b> changes in percentage corresponding to the temperature change and is independent of the sizes <b>of</b> the <b>fabrics,</b> is the β value (=kαR 0, where k, α, R 0 are the electrical resistance decrease speed, thermal diffusivity and initial resistance <b>of</b> the <b>fabrics).</b> By analyzing the β value, initial resistance R 0 and thermal diffusivity α <b>of</b> the <b>fabrics,</b> satisfactory simulation <b>of</b> the experimental data was achieved by using the model, which indicates that the model {{can be used in}} temperature control in future applications.

40|$|Biological {{environmentally}} friendly concepts are emerging to replace chemical treatments <b>of</b> <b>fabrics.</b> In this work, a new {{process for the}} coloration <b>of</b> flax <b>fabrics</b> via enzymatic oxidation of natural flavonoids (morin, quercetin) has been developed. Laccase from Trametes hirsuta is able to react with flavonoids and polymerize them, resulting in a strongly colored polymeric solution which {{can be applied to}} the coloration <b>of</b> flax <b>fabrics.</b> Two methods were investigated: (i) the simultaneous enzymatic polymerization and coloration <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> and (ii) the polymerization of flavonoids with laccase, followed by a further coloration <b>of</b> the flax <b>fabrics.</b> Factors such as temperature, reaction time, presence of NaCl or the use of bleached or unbleached fabrics were evaluated in order to increase the color <b>of</b> the <b>fabrics</b> and the color fastness. The increase of temperature, the presence of salt and the use <b>of</b> unbleached <b>fabrics</b> allowed the final color to be improved. Colorized flax fabrics with oxidized quercetin solution showed a color fixation two times higher than the fabrics colorized with oxidized morin. Finally, the polymerization of flavonoids and their binding to fibers were verified using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results confirmed this {{environmentally friendly}} process as useful for the coloration <b>of</b> flax <b>fabrics.</b> A similar technique could also be extended to the treatment of other types <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> in textile processes...|$|R

40|$|The water {{absorption}} and transport properties <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{are critical to}} wear comfort, especially for sportswear and protective clothing. A new testing apparatus, namely Forced Flow Water Transport Tester (FFWTT), was developed for characterizing the transplanar and in-plane wicking properties <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> based on gravimetric and image analysis technique. The uniqueness of this instrument is {{that the rate of}} water supply is adjustable to simulate varying sweat rates with reference to the specific end-use conditions ranging from sitting, walking, running to other strenuous activities. This instrument is versatile in terms of the types <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> that can be tested. Twenty four types <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> with varying constructions and surface finishes were tested. The results showed that FFWTT was highly sensitive and reproducible in differentiating these fabrics and it suggests that {{water absorption}} and transport properties <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> are sweat rate-dependent. Additionally, two graphic methods were proposed to map the direction of liquid transport and its relation to skin wetness, which provides easy and direct comparison among different fabrics. Correlation analysis showed that FFWTT results have strong correlation with subjective wetness sensation, implying validity and usefulness of the instrument. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
