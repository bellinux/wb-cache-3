5|$|According to saxophonist Jimmy Heath, Timmons joined Clark Terry's {{big band}} {{for a tour}} of Europe in 1974. He was unwell and drank <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> to Sweden, and fell while {{drinking}} at the bar before the band's first concert, in Malmö. Susceptible to blood clotting, he was flown back to the US. On March 1, 1974, he died from cirrhosis, {{at the age of}} 38, at St Vincent's Hospital in New York. He had been in hospital for a month. He was buried in Philadelphia, and was survived by his wife, Estelle, and son, also Bobby.|$|E

They also planned a national PWA organization which opened in New York City in June 1984. PWA-New York went on to create the first safer sex poster to appear in a gay bathhouse in the city.|$|E

Due to the severity of the impact, investigators could not take fuel sample from the wreckage. During their inspection, they found two video cameras from the crash site.|$|R

5|$|Beginning on the {{airplane}} to Berlin, flashbacks are interlaced throughout the episode, illustrating the tensions caused by Eli's frequent absence during Ziva's adolescence and the disintegration of Rivka (Weronika Rosati) and Eli David's marriage. Also while <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane,</b> Ziva explains her rationale for changing their destination: her father had told her to convert all funds to diamonds with a dealer in Berlin should she ever need to go into hiding.

5|$|Edward Felt dialed 9-1-1 {{from his}} cell phone from the rear {{lavatory}} of the aircraft seeking information at 09:58. His call was answered by dispatcher John Shaw, and Felt was able {{to tell him about}} the hijacking before the call was disconnected. Multiple news reports (originally based on a 9-1-1 supervisor's account after having overheard the call) asserted that Edward Felt reported hearing an explosion and seeing smoke from an undetermined location <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b> These reports were not corroborated by Shaw or Felt's wife, Sandra, who listened to the recording afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Final Destination is a 2000 American supernatural horror film {{directed}} by James Wong. It {{is the first}} installment of the Final Destination film series. The screenplay was written by James Wong, Glen Morgan, and Jeffrey Reddick, based on a story by Reddick. The film stars Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, and Tony Todd. Sawa portrays a teenager who cheats death after having a premonition of a catastrophic plane explosion. He {{and several of his}} classmates leave the plane before the explosion occurs, but Death later takes the lives of those who were meant to die <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E

This is equivalent to placing lots of main lens <b>on</b> <b>the</b> u <b>plane</b> in Fig.  4, which means the position information of light <b>on</b> <b>the</b> u <b>plane</b> is recorded.

5|$|The Beatles {{toured the}} Philippines in July 1966, playing two {{shows at the}} Rizal Memorial Football Stadium in Manila. Epstein unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady Imelda Marcos when {{presented}} with {{an invitation to a}} breakfast party. He had politely declined on behalf of the group, as it was their policy never to accept such official invitations. The Beatles and their entourage were ejected from their hotel on the same day and given a police escort to the airport, even though Epstein had publicly apologised for the misunderstanding in a televised statement, which was not seen or heard because of static. The entourage boarded the plane for home, but Epstein and Beatles' assistant Mal Evans were ordered off, both believing {{that they would not be}} allowed back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b> Epstein was forced to give the tax authorities £6,800 worth of Philippine peso notes earned from the Manila shows and to sign a tax bond verifying the exchange before being allowed back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> with Evans.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the representation of}} the radiated energy, E_R, in earthquakes. In seismology E_R is estimated from either far-field seismic waves or the stress and displacement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fault <b>plane.</b> Although E_R comes from the entire volume of the Earth, it can be expressed as an integral over <b>the</b> fault <b>plane.</b> However, <b>the</b> integrand cannot be given a simple physical meaning such as the radiated energy density <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fault <b>plane.</b> <b>The</b> stress <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fault <b>plane</b> changes rapidly during a seismic rupture. Although the energy radiated by this process is not included in the estimate of E_R in a simplified practice in seismology, it is correctly included in the expression of E_R in standard seismological practice. Using the representation theorem, we can express E_R as a surface integral over <b>the</b> fault <b>plane,</b> with <b>the</b> integrand containing <b>the</b> slip function <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fault <b>plane.</b> However, <b>the</b> integrand at a point depends not only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slip function at the point but also <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slip functions everywhere <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fault <b>plane.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> simple method in which E_R is estimated by summation of the local energy flux <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fault <b>plane</b> does not yield a correct estimate...|$|R
