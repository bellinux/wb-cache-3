Newly developed single crystal superalloys have the mechanical potential to operate at increasingly higher component temperatures. However, at these elevated temperatures, coating/substrate interdiffusion can shorten the protective life of the coating. Diffusion barriers between overlay coatings and substrates are being examined to extend the protective life of the coating. A previously- developed finite-difference diffusion model has been modified to predict the oxidative life enhancement due to use of a diffusion barrier. The original diffusion model, designated COSIM, simulates Al diffusion in the coating to the growing oxide scale as well as Al diffusion into the substrate. The COSIM model incorporates an oxide growth and spalling model to provide the rate of Al consumption during cyclic oxidation. Coating failure is predicted when the Al concentration at the coating surface drops to a defined critical level.

40|$|Lead (Pb) {{containing}} alloys such {{as white}} metals and Cu-Pb-Sn (lining) with Pb-based overlay plating have been extensively used as materials for {{internal combustion engine}} bearings during the last several decades. However, owing to environmental and health concerns, the use of Pb containing materials in automotive engine components is being restricted. In view of this, attempts {{are under way to}} develop and replace Pb-containing materials with Pb–free bearing materials. The tribological characteristics of these recently developed Pb-free bearing materials have, however, not been fully investigated and only a limited results about their tribological performance are available in open literature. This thesis therefore focuses on investigating the tribological performance of some recently developed Pb-free engine bearing materials. Although engine bearings are designed to operate in full film lubrication conditions yet they also operate in mixed and boundary lubrication regimes where the material properties do affect their tribological performance. There is thus a need to study the tribological behaviour of these new Pb-free bearing materials in mixed and boundary lubrication conditions vis a vis that of conventional Pb-containing bearing linings and overlays. This work has therefore aimed at investigating the tribological characteristics such as friction and wear, seizure behaviour, interaction with different oil formulations and embeddability behaviour of some selected Pb-free engine bearing materials. Friction and wear properties of Pb-free bearing materials Al-Sn based lining without <b>overlay,</b> bronze lining <b>coated</b> with Polyamide-Imide (PAI) based overlay containing MoS 2 and graphite, bronze lining coated with Al-Sn based and PAI based overlay containing MoS 2 and graphite, bronze lining <b>coated</b> with Sn-based <b>overlay,</b> and bismuth (Bi) containing bronze lining <b>coated</b> with Sn-based <b>overlay</b> have been studied using a block-on-ring test configuration under unidirectional sliding conditions in mixed and boundary lubrication regimes. The conventional Pb-containing bearing material was also studied as a reference material. Al-Sn based material showed considerably higher friction compared to the other bearing materials. The bearing material with PAI based overlay containing MoS 2 and graphite showed superior friction and wear properties compared to all other materials. Sn-based <b>overlay</b> <b>coated</b> materials resulted in comparable friction and wear properties to that of Pbbased overlay. Wear mechanism in Al-Sn based material is mainly adhesive and abrasive in case of Sn based overlay. Seizure behaviour of the bearing materials were also studied using the block-on-ring test configuration in dry as well as lubricated conditions using pure base oil and a fully formulated engine oil. The PAI based overlay containing MoS 2 and graphite showed no sign of seizure even at the highest test load in dry as well as lubricated conditions. Al-Sn based lining without overlay seizes at relatively lower load in dry condition compared to the other bearing materials. Adhesion or wear debris smearing onto the counter surface is the main causes of seizure in dry condition. In lubricated condition, seizure occurred at relatively higher load and the conventional Pb-containing material was found to have better seizure performance compared to the Al-Sn based and Sn-based overlay plated materials. Tribological compatibility of Pb-free bearing materials with different oil formulations was studied using a ball-on-bearing specimen test configuration in boundary lubrication under reciprocating sliding conditions. Four different bearing materials were investigated using different lubricants with and without oil additives. In general, the bearing materials lubricated with pure PAO base oil showed higher friction compared to those lubricated with oils containing additives. Lubricants containing additives improved wear properties of the bearing materials except in the case of Al-Sn based lining without overlay. It was also observed that the anti-wear additive level did not significantly influence the wear performance of bearing overlays. The embeddability behaviour of Pb-free bearing materials was studied using a fully formulated engine oil contaminated with SiC particles. Pb-free bearing materials with Snbased overlay, Bi-based overlay, PAI-based overlay containing MoS 2 and composite overlay containing PAI, Al, PTFE were investigated. Tests at different rotational speeds (i. e. different oil film thickness) and a constant load were carried out using a journal bearing test rig. It was found that material removal from bearing and shaft surfaces due to abrasive wear is influenced by the lubricant film thickness. The steel counter surface showed lower wear in tests using Sn based overlay and a PAI, Al and PTFE containing composite overlay compared to Bi-based overlay and PAI-based overlay containing MoS 2. ...|$|R

The thickness of alumina overlay increased with increasing the number of dip coating circles.

40|$|High {{temperature}} degradation by {{hot corrosion}} (650 - 1000 °C) and/or oxidation (3 ̆e 1000 °C) can severely reduce {{the longevity of}} advanced gas turbine engine components. The protection of high-temperature components against hot corrosion or oxidation is typically conferred by the application of either a diffusion or <b>overlay</b> metallic <b>coating</b> that is able to form a continuous, adherent, and slow-growing oxide scale. There are currently no coatings that provide adequate protection to both hot corrosion and oxidation. Indeed, there is a particular need for such protective coatings because many advanced aero, marine, and industrial gas-turbines operate in both hot corrosion and oxidation regimes in their duty cycle. Recent work at Iowa State University (ISU) has showed that a wide range Pt+Hf-modified gamma 2 ̆ 7 -Ni 3 Al + gamma-Ni alloy compositions form a very adherent and slow-growing Al 2 O 3 scale.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the factors {{surrounding}} the permeation of alkali and alkaline earth metal salts through hydrogel membranes are investigated. Although of relevance to aqueous separations in general, {{it was with}} their potential application in sensors that this work was particularly concerned. In order to study {{the effect that the}} nature of the solute has on the transport process, a single polymer matrix, poly (2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate), was initially studied. The influence of cation variation {{in the presence of a}} fixed anion was looked at, followed by the effect of the anion in the presence of a fixed cation. The anion was found to possess the dominant influence and tended to subsume any influence by the cation. This is explained in terms of the structure-making and structure-breaking characteristics of the ions in their solute-water interactions. Analogies in the transport behaviour of the salts are made with the Hofmeister series. The effect of the chemical composition of the polymer backbone on the water structuring in the hydrogel and, consequently, transport through the membrane, was investigated by preparing a series of poly (2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) copolymer membranes and determining the permeability coefficient of salts with a fixed anion. The results were discussed in terms of the `free-volume' model of permeation and the water structuring of the polymer backbone. The ability of ionophores to selectively modulate the permeation of salts through hydrogel membranes was also examined. The results indicated that a dualsorption model was in operation.

The bond coats were applied by either high velocity oxy-fuel spraying (HVOF) or EBPVD. Isothermal oxidation tests were carried out at 950 °C, 1050 °C and 1150 °C for both coating system for up to 3000 hours. Cyclic oxidation testing was conducted at 1150 °C in one hour cycles to coating failure on both coatings. A detailed examination on the oxide thickness was conducted on all specimens, along with characterisation of the bond coat and TGO. This was coupled with examination of specimen cross-sections for cracking and signs of coating degradation. Isothermal oxidation showed sub parabolic oxide growth consistent with the literature. Detailed analysis of oxide thickness showed a normal distribution but with increasing standard deviation with increasing oxidation time. Both bond coats were dual phase, β + γ. The EBPVD applied bond coat only, was found to contain yttrium rich precipitates in the bond coat and TGO. Both coatings showed no increase in surface roughness after either isothermal or thermal cycle testing. Short sub-critical cracks were observed at the TGO/topcoat interface in the HVOF applied bond coat only associated with the flanks of asperities. Coating failure in both coatings occurred at the TGO/bond coat interface on cooling and was likely driven by the thermal expansion mismatch between the TGO, topcoat and substrate. The initial mechanism of crack formation was not determined conclusively but could be a wedge cracking type mechanism. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Oxidation tests at 900 - 1100 °C {{demonstrated that the}} oxidation resistance of the diffused coatings was significantly enhanced by laser surface remelt. The oxide scales formed on both the diffused and the remelted coatings all exhibit excellent spallation resistance. The oxide scale on the remelted coatings was thinner with better protectiveness {{and seemed to be}} high in alumina. The diffused samples had thicker oxide scales and considerable internal oxidation along the inherent pores. Laser modified coatings had microstructures with very fine crystallites, and a rather uniform distribution of active elements. Surface segregation of yttrium on the coating surface, enabled the nucleation and formation of a compact alumina scale...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} present new and complex {{configurations}} involving micro-structured fiber Bragg gratings (MSFBGs) as advanced devices for sensing and communications applications. First, the spectral behaviour of multi-defect MSFBGs is investigated with particular {{regards to the}} possibility to carry out multi-parameter sensor by a single sensing element. More defects along the grating permit the formation of more defect states inside the band-gap ruled by the multiple interaction of the signal reflected by the unperturbed grating regions modulated by the phase delays of the perturbations. Here, a practical case based on a two-defect MSFBG is taken into account, revealing the potentiality to perform dual SRI measurements with a single MSFBG device. Finally, a novel configuration has been considered involving a single-defect MSFBG coated with nano-sized coatings with higher refractive index compared to the cladding one. The presence of a high refractive index coating along the thinned region would induce the mode redistribution and the transition from core modes to <b>overlay</b> modes if <b>coating</b> features are properly selected. Here, sensitivity characteristics of the proposed device are analysed and significant improvement in the sensing performances have been obtained, including the possibility to tune the maximum sensitivity in the desired rang...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} hot {{corrosion}} resistance of YSZ thermal barrier coatings, a 25 {micro}m and a 2 {micro}m thick Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay were deposited by HVOF thermal spray and by sol-gel coating method, respectively, onto {{to the surface}} of YSZ coating. Indenter test was employed to investigate the spalling of YSZ with and without Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay after hot corrosion. The results showed that Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay acted as a barrier against the infiltration of the molten salt into the YSZ coating during exposure, thus significantly reduced the amount of M-phase of ZrO{sub 2 } in YSZ coating. However, a thick Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay was harmful for TBC by increasing compressive stress which causes crack and spalling of YSZ coating. As a result, a dense and thin Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay is critical for simultaneously preventing YSZ from hot corrosion and spalling. In the next reporting period, we will measure or calculate the residue stress within Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } <b>overlay</b> and YSZ <b>coating</b> to study the mechanism of effect of Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay on spalling of YSZ coating...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} further improve the hot {{corrosion}} resistance of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), an Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay of 58 {micro}m thick was deposited {{on the surface}} of YSZ by electron-beam physical vapor deposition. Hot corrosion tests were performed on the YSZ coatings with {gamma}-Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay and {alpha}-Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay in molten salt mixture (Na 2 SO 4 + 5 wt%V 2 O 5) at 950 C. The {alpha}-Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay was obtained by the post-annealing of g-Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay at 1200 C for 1 h. The results showed that compared with the hot corrosion resistance of YSZ coating with 25 {micro}m thick {gamma}-Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay, either thickening {gamma}-Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay or employing {alpha}-Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay could impair the hot corrosion resistance of YSZ coating, because the tensile stresses developed in the alumina overlay in both cases due to the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) between alumina and zirconia resulted in cracking of Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay. The formation of cracks increased contact area between molten salt and Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay, and also the penetration rate of molten salt into Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } <b>overlay</b> and YSZ <b>coating,</b> leading a faster and greater degradation of YSZ coating upon exposure. In the next reporting period, we will study the effect of Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay thickness on hot corrosion and spalling of YSZ coatings...|$|R
