5|$|A small species, the Inaccessible Island rail has brown plumage {{and a black}} {{bill and}} feet. It {{occupies}} most habitats on Inaccessible Island, from the beaches to the central plateau, feeding {{on a variety of}} small invertebrates and also some plant matter. Pairs are territorial and monogamous, with both parents being responsible for incubating the eggs and raising the chicks. Its adaptations to living <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> island at high densities include low base metabolic rates, small clutch sizes, and flightlessness.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Emma Cons, a Victorian philanthropist {{who ran the}} Old Vic theatre in {{a working-class}} area of London, began {{presenting}} regular fortnightly performances of opera excerpts. Although the theatre licensing laws of the day prevented full costumed performances, Cons presented condensed versions of well-known operas, always sung in English. Among the performers were noted singers such as Charles Santley. These operatic evenings quickly became more popular than the dramas that Cons had been staging separately. In 1898, she recruited her niece Lilian Baylis to help run the theatre. At {{the same time she}} appointed Charles Corri as the Old Vic's musical director. Baylis and Corri, despite many disagreements, shared a passionate belief in popularising opera, hitherto generally the preserve of the rich and fashionable. They worked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> budget, with an amateur chorus and a professional orchestra of only 18 players, for whom Corri rescored the instrumental parts of the operas. By {{the early years of the}} 20th century, the Old Vic was able to present semi-staged versions of Wagner operas.|$|E
5|$|The {{miniature}} Enterprise {{was again}} {{used for the}} spacewalk sequence. Even on the large model, {{it was hard to}} make the miniature appear realistic in extreme close-up shots. To make the pullback shot work, the camera had to be within one-eighth of an inch from the model. Painter Kim Smith spent several days <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> area of the model to add enough surface detail for the close-up, but even then the focus was barely adequate. To compensate, the crew used a wider-angle lens and shot at the highest f-stop they could. The live-action scenes of the spacewalking crew were then digitally added. Wide shots used footage of photo doubles walking across a large bluescreen draped across ILM's parking lot at night.|$|E

He eradicated all insect species and observed the re-population by new species. A book The Theory of Island Biogeography about this experiment became a standard ecology text.|$|E
25|$|The {{story begins}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> island called Morrowland (original German: Lummerland), {{which has just}} enough space for a small palace, a train station and rails all around the island, a grocery store, a small house, a king, two subjects, a {{locomotive}} named Emma, and a locomotive engineer {{by the name of}} Luke (Lukas) (who, as railway civil servant, is not a subject). One day, the postman – who has to come by ship – drops off a package with a nearly illegible address for a Mrs. Krintuuth at Zorroulend. On the back was a large 13. After a futile search for the addressee among Morrowland's few inhabitants, they open the package. To their immense surprise, there's a black baby inside. After the commotion has died down, the baby is adopted by the islanders and is named Jim Button.|$|E

25|$|Beta-catenin is a proto-oncogene. Mutations of {{this gene}} are {{commonly}} found {{in a variety of}} cancers: in primary hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, ovarial carcinoma, breast cancer, lung cancer and glioblastoma. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of all tissue samples sequenced from all cancers display mutations in the CTNNB1 gene. Most of these mutations cluster <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> area of the N-terminal segment of β-catenin: the β-TrCP binding motif. Loss-of-function mutations of this motif essentially make ubiquitinylation and degradation of β-catenin impossible. It will cause β-catenin to translocate to the nucleus without any external stimulus and continuously drive transcription of its target genes. Increased nuclear β-catenin levels have also been noted in basal cell carcinoma (BCC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), prostate cancer (CaP), pilomatrixoma (PTR) and medulloblastoma (MDB) These observations may or may not implicate a mutation in the β-catenin gene: other Wnt pathway components can also be faulty.|$|E
25|$|The {{team had}} {{originally}} {{predicted that the}} system would have a practical detection range {{on the order of}} , but never managed to stretch this much beyond 3 miles. Much of this was due to the inefficient system being used to blank out the receiver during the transmission pulse, which wasted most of the radio energy. This final piece of the puzzle was provided by Arthur Cooke, who suggested using the Sutton tube filled with a dilute gas as a switch, replacing the spark gap system. During transmission, the power of the magnetron would cause the gas to ionise, presenting an almost perfect radio mirror that would prevent the signal from reaching the output. When the pulse ended the gas would rapidly de-ionise, allowing signals to flow across (or around) the cavity and reach the output. Skinner took up development of the concept with Ward and Starr, initially trying helium and hydrogen, but eventually settling <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> amount of water vapour and argon. The resulting design, known as a soft Sutton tube, went into production as the CV43 and the first examples arrived in the summer of 1941.|$|E

The magazine discussed the difficulty of the game, saying, [...] "Most games these days tend to hold your hand all the way through...Devil May Cry is not like that.

2500|$|In 2002, Santorum called {{intelligent}} design [...] "a legitimate scientific theory {{that should be}} taught in science classes", but by 2005 he had adopted the Teach the Controversy approach.
