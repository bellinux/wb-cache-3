40|$|The {{place name}} Aiali is sited on lowland between the medieval town of Grosseto and the Roman town of Roselle in central Italy. The site {{discussed}} in this paper was detected from the air during the Aerial Archaeology Research School organised by the University of Siena in 2001. Aerial survey allowed us to recognise an area within which {{the growth of the}} wheat varied {{in such a way as}} to reveal an articulated group of traces that made up the plan of a complex of structures interpreted as a Roman villa, 4 hectares in extent. In the following years Aiali has become the most important test site for the Laboratory of Landscape Archaeology and Remote Sensing at Grosseto. Since 2001 we have collected, processed and interpreted many different kinds of data: Quickbird- 2 satellite imagery, historical and recent vertical coverage (from 1954 to 2001), <b>oblique</b> <b>air</b> <b>photographs</b> in various years, seasons and lighting condition; field-walking survey, and geophysical survey (magnetometry, GPR, EM, ERT). One intention of the Aiali project is to apply the highest available level and intensity of archaeological prospection methods on a large, complex and stratified site, producing material from the from Etruscan, Roman and Medieval periods. At the same time Aiali forms the starting point for a more wide-ranging approach to the study of the landscape between Grosseto and Roselle...|$|R
50|$|The Royal Commission's archive {{gave the}} {{organisation}} a renewed raison d'Ãªtre. Years of under-capitalisation of the National Monuments Record had {{meant that it}} had no effective, modern finding aids. Computerisation of the records data now began to unlock its riches, including the collection of images, the largest of its kind in Wales and half as big again as that of the National Library. The National Monuments Record had become a nationwide resource of a nature different to that of the regional sites and monuments records. It expanded rapidly with significant donations from many public and private sources supplementing the detailed survey and photographic records of the Commission itself. Transfers from many other public organisations, including Cadw on behalf of the Welsh Assembly Government, take place from time to time. Important collections have been accepted from the private and commercial sectors, one of the most notable being the acquisition in 2008 of the Aerofilms collection of historic <b>oblique</b> <b>air</b> <b>photographs.</b> Today, the photographs in the National Monuments Record are Wales's largest national collection, with about 1.5 million images. A foretaste of the future was the Commission's participation in the Gathering the Jewels project, which provided an opportunity to make available online many notable images from the National Monuments Record and began a digitisation programme which remains one of the Commission's priorities in its service to the public.|$|R

For the purpose of magnetic prospecting a highly automated system consisting of a 4 -Foerster-probes (Ferex DLG) on a chart with GPS and a Overhauser magnetometer (GSM- 19) were applied in the same grid. At the time of the summer school there was no caesium-magnetometer system available. Therefore the whole area had been remeasured some weeks later with a Scintrex Smartmag SM 4 G-special in various sensor configurations again in the same grid and under the same surface conditions for comparison (the magnetometer was made available for the test by Schweitzer-GPI company) ...|$|R
