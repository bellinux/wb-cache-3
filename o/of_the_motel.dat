However, he discovers that a local welder named Llewelyn Moss, who chanced upon the money while hunting, has taken it and left town. Chigurh tracks Moss down to a motel using a receiver that connects to a transponder hidden in the satchel of money. However, Moss has hidden the money in a ventilation duct, and when he returns to the motel, suspecting (correctly) that someone is in his room, he retrieves the money from the connected vent in a second rented room on the backside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motel.</b> His original room is in fact being occupied by a group of Mexican gangsters sent to ambush him. When Chigurh enters this room, he kills the Mexicans and searches for the money, but it is nowhere to be found. Moss, meanwhile, has already fled after hearing the subsequent gunfire.|$|E
25|$|The defense {{arguments}} {{began on}} October 20 with Barbra Schultz, the hotel's General Manager, taking the stand. Tinker asked if Selena had actually screamed {{out to them}} to lock the doors. She replied that Selena had never asked for the doors to be locked and was only moaning on the floor. Schultz further stated that her former employee, Vela, was not trustworthy. Schultz also said that all the employees began formulating different opinions on what happened on March 31 when the prosecution called on them to testify. Motel staff maid, Gloria Magaña, doubted the validity of Espinoza and Martinez's accounts. She told the jury {{that it was impossible}} for both employees to have seen Saldívar chasing Selena because their work {{was on the other side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motel</b> building. Magaña claimed to have seen Selena running through the parking lot, but did not see Saldívar chasing after her. Tinker called Marilyn Greer, Selena's seventh grade teacher, to the stand. She told the jury that Selena had had the ability to graduate with honors and could have easily obtained a college scholarship. Greer then spoke about how Quintanilla, Jr. had taken away the possibility of college for Selena, wasting her youth by forcing her to sing at nightclubs and bars for money; something that was unhealthy for a thirteen-year-old girl.|$|E
500|$|Rita Curran, a 24-year-old {{elementary}} school teacher and part-time motel maid, was murdered in her basement apartment on July 19, 1971 in Burlington, Vermont; she had been strangled, bludgeoned and raped. The location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motel</b> where she worked (adjacent to Bundy's birthplace, the Elizabeth Lund Home for Unwed Mothers) and similarities to known Bundy crime scenes led retired FBI agent John Bassett to propose him as a suspect. No evidence firmly places Bundy in Burlington on that date, but municipal records note that a person named [...] "Bundy" [...] was bitten by a dog that week, and long stretches of Bundy's time—including the summer of 1971—remain unaccounted for.

500|$|Though {{the pilot}} was shot in Los Angeles, {{principal}} filming {{for the rest of}} the season took place in Vancouver, British Columbia. Local sites often served as shooting locations, with much of [...] "Dead in the Water" [...] taking place at Buntzen Lake and the climax of [...] "Wendigo" [...] occurring in a Britannia Beach mine. Likewise, Riverview Hospital functioned as a mental institution in [...] "Asylum". Though production has sometimes recycled sets from other television series—"The Benders" [...] made use of a previously-built Western town, while the warehouse-loft set of [...] "Shadow" [...] originated from the series Tru Calling—most episodes usually require the construction of new sets due to the constant change of setting. The production team, however, created reusable standing sets in the form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motel</b> rooms frequented by the Winchesters. Each episode presents a different theme to disguise the motel-room set's repeated use, with different colors, bedspreads, and curtains being used.

2500|$|Initially {{the case}} was being {{investigated}} locally. Release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motel</b> video showing Anderson being run over attracted national attention, ultimately resulting in a federal civil rights investigation. On August 14, 2011, about 500 people marched in Jackson from a church to the motel to denounce the [...] "racially motivated hate crime". The group included a mix of [...] "rich/poor, black/white, male/female, gay and straight," [...] according to 75-year-old activist Rims Barber, among them Christian and Jewish clergy. On the Internet a [...] "war of words" [...] ensued {{as to how the}} crime should be classified. The subsequent FBI investigation found evidence of a conspiracy by 10 individuals to commit several hate crimes against African Americans in Jackson from the spring of 2011 to 2012. These 10 were indicted, each pleaded guilty, and each was sentenced to federal prison.|$|E
2500|$|On October 19, {{the defense}} called the two {{surgeons}} {{who tried to}} revive Selena at the hospital. The defense questioned why Quintanilla, Jr. would request that a blood transfusion not to be performed on Selena due to his religious beliefs, when by law, Pérez would have the final say {{whether or not the}} procedure would be performed. The autopsy pictures of Selena were displayed for everyone to see. The white American jury member was affected by the pictures, and was seen [...] "bursting into tears" [...] as Lloyd White described his findings in detail. According to Arrarás, Saldívar was seen as [...] "impassive"; she had [...] "lowered her head" [...] when the autopsy pictures were shown. After confirming that Selena was not pregnant, contradicting rumors in media reports, White announced his conclusion: [...] "this was a homicide, not an accident." [...] The prosecution called on a firearms expert who found the gun to be in working condition and stating that a person pulling the trigger must use a [...] "great amount of pressure". Valdez showed pictures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motel</b> room where Selena had been shot, indicating that: [...] "it was impossible for [...] not know her friend had been wounded."

40|$|This chapter explores how Supernatural, {{like other}} horror {{television}} shows, situates its characters as mediating between the mundane everyday contemporary world, and a strange, Other, historic or mythological world. The show’s emphasis on <b>the</b> <b>motel</b> rooms inhabited by the Winchester brothers as transitional spaces and places will be explored {{as a key}} site <b>of</b> liminality. <b>The</b> <b>motel</b> rooms, simultaneously generic (furniture and facilities) and individualised (at times spectacularly unique décor), offer an image <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> road genre has “obvious potential for romanticizing alienation {{as well as for}} problematizing <b>the</b> uniform identity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nations’ culture” (Cohan and Hark 1997, 1) : Sam and Dean are marginal characters cut off from mainstream American society and thus have a problematic relationship to it. <b>The</b> <b>motel</b> rooms are, <b>of</b> course, also an important plot device and the close quarters living intensifies their relationship. Public and private space are also blurred by <b>the</b> <b>motel</b> room, and while the Winchesters are, effectively, travelling on a professional basis, as brothers they tend to share one room. <b>The</b> lack <b>of</b> any private or domestic space (and female family members) challenges standard representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American family. This conscious choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> (retro-decorated) <b>motel</b> not only situate the brothers in an individual community but also serve as a link to that community’s past, and personal, familial and community histories often combine in episode storylines. The Winchesters are figures who move, often uneasily, between different planes and different states of being. Like many other liminal heroes, therefore, they fulfil their function by not being at home anywher...|$|R
