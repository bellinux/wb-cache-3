40|$|Understanding the {{sediment}} transport in <b>oscillatory</b> <b>flows</b> {{is essential to}} the investigation of the overall sediment budget for coastal regions. This overall budget is crucial for the prediction of the morphological change of coastline in engineering applications. Since {{the sediment}} transport in <b>oscillatory</b> <b>flows</b> is dense particle-laden flow, appropriate modeling of the particle interaction is critical. Although traditional two-fluid approaches have been applied to the study of sediment transport in <b>oscillatory</b> <b>flows,</b> the approaches do not resolve the interaction of the particles. Particle-resolved modeling of sediment transport in <b>oscillatory</b> <b>flows</b> and the study of micromechanics of sediment particles are still lacking. In this work, a parallel CFD-DEM solver that can resolve the inter-particle collision is applied to study the granular micromechanics of sediment particles in <b>oscillatory</b> <b>flows.</b> The results obtained from the CFD-DEM solver are validated by using the experimental data of coarse and medium sands. The comparison with experimental results suggests that the flow velocity, the sediment flux and the net sediment transport rate predicted by are satisfactory. Moreover, the micromechanic quantities of the sediment bed are presented in detail, including Voronoi concentration, coordination number, and particle interaction force. It is demonstrated that variation of these micromechanic quantities at different phases in the oscillatory cycle is significant, which is due to different responses of the sediment bed. To investigate the structural properties of the sediment bed, the correlation of the Voronoi volume fraction and coordination number are compared to the results from the fluidized bed simulations. The consistency in the comparison indicates the structural micromechanics of sediment transport and fluidized bed are similar despite the differences in flow patterns...|$|R

In steady shear flows, the slip length increases almost linearly with shear rate. We found that the velocity profiles in <b>oscillatory</b> <b>flows</b> are well described by the Stokes flow solution with the slip length {{that depends on the}} local shear rate. Interestingly, the rate dependence of the slip length obtained in steady shear flows is recovered when the slip length in <b>oscillatory</b> <b>flows</b> is plotted {{as a function of the}} local shear rate magnitude.

40|$|The {{critical}} velocity v_c for {{the onset of}} quantum turbulence in <b>oscillatory</b> <b>flows</b> of superfluid helium is universal and scales as v_c ∼√(κω), where κ is the circulation quantum and ω is the oscillation frequency.

Only the numerical prefactor may depend somewhat on the geometry of the oscillating object because the flow velocity at the surface of the object may differ from the velocity amplitude of the body. A more detailed analysis derived from the dynamics of the turbulent state gives v_c ≈√(8 κω/β), where β∼ 1 depends on the mutual friction parameters.
