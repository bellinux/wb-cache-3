The chapter argues that both Wittgenstein and such Zen thinkers as Shunryu Suzuki regard philosophy as, at one level, indicating that ordinary practice, ordinary language, and <b>ordinary</b> <b>life</b> are “in order” as they are—requiring neither critique nor validation by philosophy—while, at another, they regard philosophical insight as necessary to living <b>ordinary</b> <b>life</b> in an enlightened way.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} <b>ordinary</b> <b>life</b> and religious commitment among twelve convert Buddhist practitioners {{who were members of}} the Zen Buddhist Temple in Toronto, Canada. Their experiences are investigated from the perspective of Charles Taylor 2 ̆ 7 s theories on the affirmation of <b>ordinary</b> <b>life.</b> Taylor argues that a tension exists between <b>ordinary</b> <b>life</b> and religious values in North American society. The paper 2 ̆ 7 s objective is to discover how interview participants balanced the demands of <b>ordinary</b> <b>life</b> (i. e. those aspects of life relating to family and vocation) and their commitment to a religious tradition that emphasizes renunciation, contemplation and monasticism. The study demonstrates that interview participants were engaged in a two-way process of transformation. They were informing and transforming their everyday lives {{as a result of their}} commitment to Buddhism. This is a process which involved the adoption and adaptation of certain Buddhist practices and principles. In so doing, they were creating a form of lay Buddhism that was influenced by the tradition, by their religious institution, and by their North American worldviews and lifestyles...|$|R
40|$|This {{ground-breaking}} book {{offers a}} new approach to the understanding of everyday life, the media and cultural change. It explores the social pattern of <b>ordinary</b> <b>life</b> in the context of recent theories and accounts of social and cultural change. Brian Longhurst argues that our social and cultural lives are becoming increasingly audienced and performed and that activities in everyday life are changing due to the ever-growing importance and salience of the media. These changes involve people forging new ways of belonging, where among other things they seek to distinguish themselves from others. In Cultural Change and <b>Ordinary</b> <b>Life,</b> Longhurst evaluates changes in the media and <b>ordinary</b> <b>life</b> in the context of large-scale cultural change, especially with respect to globalization and hybridisation, fragmentation, spectacle and performance, and enthusing or fan-like activities. He makes the case that analysis of the media has to be brought into a more thorough dialogue with other forms of research that have looked at social processes. Cultural Change and <b>Ordinary</b> <b>Life</b> is key reading for students and researchers of sociology, media studies, cultural studies and mass communication...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the philosophy of Sextus Empiricus (c. late 2 nd Century CE), a skeptic who provides the most complete account of Pyrrhonian skepticism that survives from antiquity. In particular, this dissertation examines Sextus' account of skeptical assent, the attitude that structures and informs {{the life of the}} skeptic. Accordingly, this dissertation has two aims: first, to elaborate and defend a novel method of interpreting Sextus' claims and concepts, one based on their significance in <b>ordinary</b> <b>life</b> and language; and, second, to apply this method to Sextus' claims about the nature of skeptical assent in order to generate a novel account thereof. In the first chapter, the most widely-held and influential interpretations of skeptical assent are elaborated and taxonomized. It is argued that all these interpretations neglect to pay sufficient attention to the self-reflexivity of Sextus' skepticism, in consequence of which Sextus' own claims about skeptical assent must be understood as expressing skeptical assent. It is argued, moreover, that this neglect of self-reflexivity cannot be remedied without abandoning these interpretations. In the second chapter, Sextus' claims about <b>ordinary</b> <b>life</b> (including language) are examined and it is argued that Sextus regards skepticism as a distinctive expression of <b>ordinary</b> <b>life.</b> However, <b>ordinary</b> <b>life</b> may be understood in two different ways and the failure to distinguish them has resulted in a misconception of Sextus' outlook. The two different conceptions are therefore elaborated and it is argued that Sextus' understanding of <b>ordinary</b> <b>life</b> accords with only one of them. Finally, responses are provided to some important objections to the close connection between iii skepticism and <b>ordinary</b> <b>life.</b> In the third and final chapter, Sextus' conception of <b>ordinary</b> <b>life</b> is deployed to produce a novel understanding of skeptical assent. The focus here is Sextus' account of assent in Outlines of Pyrrhonism 1. 13. Each of the key concepts in that account are explained in light of chapter two's results. Additionally, the roots of a concept central to skeptical assent are located in Aristotle's methodological reflections. Finally, the novel account of skeptical assent is distinguished from two other closely related accounts.. iv 2021 - 05 - 3...|$|R
