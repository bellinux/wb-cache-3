25|$|The {{theory of}} false {{necessity}} develops {{the idea that}} the organization of society is made and can be remade—we can rebel against the worlds we have built; we can interrupt our rebellions and establish <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> any of those worlds. By emphasizing the disembodiment of institutional and social structures, the theory provides a basis to explain ourselves and our world without using necessitarian thought or predetermined institutional arrangements.|$|E
25|$|We {{are able}} to {{apprehend}} and represent nature to <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> the successive forms which its development assumes {{since it is the}} same spirit of which we become aware in self-consciousness, though here unconsciously. The variety of its forms is not imposed on it externally, since there is no external teleology in nature. Nature is a self-forming whole, within which only natural explanations can be sought. The function of Naturphilosophie is to exhibit the ideal as springing from the real, not to deduce the real from the ideal.|$|E
25|$|These men, {{whom you}} see {{slaughtered}} on the ground, were neither Pagans nor Mahometans, at whose death we should rejoice—they were Christians, lately your subjects and your countrymen, {{some of them}} your relations.

25|$|The {{specific}} {{functions of}} the ego, {{as determined by the}} relative predominance of sense or intellect, are either {{functions of the}} senses (or organism) or functions of the intellect. The former fall into the two classes of feelings (subjective) and perceptions (objective); the latter, according as the receptive or the spontaneous element predominates, into cognition and volition. In cognition, thought is ontologically oriented to the object; and in volition it is the teleological purpose of thought. In the first case we receive (in our fashion) the object of thought into <b>ourselves.</b> <b>In</b> the latter we plant it out into the world. Both cognition and volition are functions of thought as well as forms of moral action.|$|E

Further, we recognise that, if any of us conducts <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> an unbecoming or disorderly manner or shows insufficient diligence in their studies and, though admonished, does not improve, it is within the power of the Senatus Academicus to inflict on such students a fitting penalty or even expel them from the University.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} political application of social media is Barack Obama's election campaign in 2008.

His campaign won by engaging everyday people and empowering volunteers, donors and advocates, through social networks, text messaging, email messaging and online videos. Obama's social media campaign was vast, with his campaign boasting 5 million 'friends' on over 15 social networking sites, with over 3 million friends just on Facebook. Another significant success of the campaign was online videos, with nearly 2,000 YouTube videos being put online, receiving over 80 million views.|$|E

500|$|In {{regards to}} the various stories {{throughout}} the episode, {{and the amount of}} time passing in each one of them, Cogman stated, [...] "The timelines between the various storylines don’t necessarily line up within a given episode.

We realized a while ago that if we tied <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> knots trying to make all the “story days” line up between all the characters the momentum would suffer." ...|$|E
500|$|Knowing {{that they}} could not match the quality of other computer-animated films, the film was instead {{designed}} to imitate the look of stop motion.

[...] Edwards contrasted the technically innovative, but critically panned 1986 film Howard the Duck with the simple, but beloved puppet character Kermit the Frog to illustrate to his crew the importance of well-written, likeable characters over technical quality.|$|E
