The methods of preparing cargo-encapsulated microgels generally include flowing through a flow-focusing nozzle of a microfluidic device a macromer phase, an oil phase, and a crosslinker phase to form microgel droplets by oil-water emulsion. The phases are pumped, injected, or flowed through the microfluidic device such that as the macromer phase approaches the flow focusing nozzle, the co-flowing <b>oil</b> phase <b>shields</b> the macromer from contact with the crosslinker phase until flow instability occurs and macromer phase droplets form. After flow instability occurs, the crosslinker diffuses from the crosslinker phase into the droplets in an effective amount to covalently crosslink the macromer into a microgel network encapsulating the cargo in the crosslinked macromer.

The addition of antioxidant plant extracts (i. e. essential oil) to sunscreens is habitually performed, to increase their UV protective effects and to contrast pro-radical and cytotoxic compounds present in these solutions. According to these observations, in the present work, the alteration of chemical composition and bioactive properties of Lavandula angustifolia Miller essential oil, exposed to UV light, was investigated. UV induced a significant deterioration of lavender oil biochemical profile. Moreover, the antioxidant activity of this solution, in in vitro tests and directly on B 16 -F 10 melanoma cells, greatly decreased after UV treatment. Our results also showed that essential <b>oil</b> was <b>shielded</b> from UV stress by propolis addition. Even after UV treatment, bee glue highly protected lavender oil secondary metabolites from degradation and also preserved their antiradical properties, both in in vitro antioxidant assays and in cell oxidative damage evaluations.

40|$|The reuse of grey water, for {{applications}} such as toilet flushing and irrigation, represents a potential sustainable solution to water shortages experienced by regions worldwide. Although reused grey water is not intended for potable use, the potential for transmission of waterborne pathogens by aerosol inhalation, topical contact, or indirect ingestion is a key concern for grey water reuse. This thesis explores the pathogen content of grey water and investigates pathogen removal through treatment and disinfection processes. The impacts of organic and particulate material in grey water on the efficacy of disinfection processes are investigated in depth. Grey water can potentially harbour a range of pathogenic microorganisms, with opportunistic bacterial pathogens in grey water indicating a particular risk of grey water reuse for the vulnerable members of society. The disinfection of grey water is therefore critical prior to reuse. Particulate material in grey water limits the efficacy of disinfection by chlorine, ultraviolet light, and origanum essential <b>oil,</b> by <b>shielding</b> microorganisms from the applied disinfectant. Microbial resistance to the disinfectants {{was linked to the}} particle size distribution of the grey water, with increasing particle size offering greater protection to associated microorganisms. Additional organic material was shown to reduce the applied disinfectant but no impact on microorganism resistance to disinfection was observed when a constant disinfectant dose was maintained. Treatment of grey water, targeting the removal of large particulate material, improves the efficacy of grey water disinfection, allowing compliance with stringent microbiological standards for urban water reuse.

40|$|The muon-induced {{radioactive}} isotopes, especially neutrons, {{are dangerous}} background component for rare-event detection in underground experiments, like neutrino-less double-beta decay and dark matter search. Understanding these cosmogenic backgrounds {{is crucial for}} these experiments. An underground experiment aiming at measuring the cosmic-ray muons' flux and their neutron production yield in liquid scintillator through spallation process is being {{carried out in the}} Aberdeen Tunnel laboratory located in Hong Kong with a total vertical overburden of 235 m of rocks (611 m. w. e.). The Aberdeen Tunnel detection system is constituted of a Muon Tracker (MT) for muon tagging and a Neutron Detector (ND) for neutron detection. The MT consists of 60 plastic scintillator hodoscopes to determine the incoming muon direction and the ND is a two-zone detector containing 760 L of gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator as target volume and 1900 L of mineral <b>oil</b> as <b>shields.</b> The experiment has been taking data stably since 2012. To obtain reliable results, the detector performance and the stability of the experiment have been studied in this work. Muon-induced fast neutrons can be captured in Gd-LS with characteristic energies released and the capture time follows a characteristic exponential distribution. By using the capture time and energy information, we can select the neutron candidates and thus calculate the neutron production yield. The energy of a neutron capture event is reconstructed from the calibrated photo-multiplier tube signals, while the directions of cosmic-ray muons can be reconstructed from the MT. The mean energy of the incoming muons that pass the selection criteria was estimated by a simulation code MUSIC that transported atmospheric muon spectrum through the mountains to the laboratory, and is found to be 92 GeV. The neutron production yield is calculated to be Yn = (3 : 28 ± 0 : 12 (sta:) ± 0 : 24 (sys:)) X 〖 10 〗^(- 4) (n/μ〖gcm〗^(- 2)) for both the showering muon and single muon events. This result is about two times higher than the expectation value from previous simulations and experiments. The neutron production yield of the single muons is calculated to be Yn = (1 : 04 ± 0 : 08 (sta:) ± 0 : 07 (sys:)) X 〖 10 〗^(- 4) (n/μ〖gcm〗^(- 2)). This reveals a enhancement of the neutron production from the muons accompanied by showers. published_or_final_versionPhysicsMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
50|$|While {{playing in}} the NFL, Flynn made about $8,500 a year, and so after an injury to his knee, Flynn {{decided to take a}} job with Skelly Oil Company in Duncan, Oklahoma. Flynn later {{relocated}} to Tulsa, Oklahoma, and went to work for White <b>Shield</b> <b>Oil</b> and Gas Company. In 1972, Flynn formed Flynn Energy Corp. and by 1976 the company had been named Oklahoma's Stock of the Year by Oklahoma Business magazine. Less than two years later, Flynn sold the oil-and gas firm for over $30 million. During the period from 1972-1978, the company drilled 342 wells in Oklahoma, Louisiana, Michigan, Texas, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, Arkansas and Colorado. During this period the company developed 80.3 BCF of Net Equivalent Gas Reserves having a Total Income of $152 MM. The Company went public in February 1974 and was publicly traded, (OTC), until the assets were sold in December 1978, to Reserve Oil and Gas for a total cash consideration of $54 MM. This was an asset sale, and the Company was immediately reorganized after the closing. The second Flynn Energy Corp. was established at that time. This company was run much like the first, and between 1978-1989 the company drilled 274 wells and earned $390 million. Flynn went on to spend over 40 years in the oil and gas industry, he founded and managed two successful publicly traded companies. Flynn also founded DMF Inc. which is a privately owned corporation. DMF Inc. holds interest in 19 producing wells in Michigan, Oklahoma, Texas, and Louisiana. Between Flynn Energy Corp. and DMF Inc., the net income for both companies totaled $542 million.|$|R
