25|$|Before the mid-1960s, the United Kingdom did {{not require}} {{pre-marketing}} approval of drugs. The British Family Planning Association (FPA) through its clinics was then the primary provider <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> services in Britain and provided only contraceptives that were on its Approved List of Contraceptives (established in 1934). In 1957, Searle began marketing Enavid (Enovid 10mg in the U.S.) for menstrual disorders. Also in 1957, the FPA established a Council for the Investigation of Fertility Control (CIFC) to test and monitor oral contraceptives which began animal testing of oral contraceptives and in 1960 and 1961 began three large clinical trials in Birmingham, Slough, and London.|$|E
25|$|The midwifery {{model of}} {{pregnancy}} and childbirth {{as a normal}} and healthy process plays a much larger role in Sweden and the Netherlands {{than the rest of}} Europe, however. Swedish midwives stand out, since they administer 80 percent of prenatal care and more than 80 percent <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> services in Sweden. Midwives in Sweden attend all normal births in public hospitals and Swedish women tend to have fewer interventions in hospitals than American women. The Dutch infant mortality rate in 1992 was the tenth-lowest rate in the world, at 6.3 deaths per thousand births, while the United States ranked twenty-second. Midwives in the Netherlands and Sweden owe a great deal of their success to supportive government policies.|$|E
25|$|Although family {{planning}} was {{established as a}} national goal in 1964, efforts during the Second Malaysia Plan to promote it were hampered by government neglect. Much of the success achieved by the National Family Planning Board occurred {{during the years of}} the First Malaysia Plan (1966–1970). The Second Malaysia Plan hoped to add 600,000new users <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> techniques, but the facilities and personnel provided were inadequate. The topic was viewed as rather sensitive by the government, and thus {{family planning}} was mostly ignored. Ironically, in 1984 Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad effectively eliminated family planning as a government policy by announcing the National Population Policy, which targeted a 70million population by 2100—up from 12.6million in 1984.|$|E

500|$|To {{optimise}} women's {{control over}} pregnancy, {{it is essential}} that culturally appropriate contraceptive advice and means are widely, easily, and affordably available to anyone that is sexually active, including adolescents. In {{many parts of the world}} access to contraception and family planning services is very difficult or non existent and even in developed counties cultural and religious traditions can create barriers to access. Reported usage of adequate contraception by women has risen only slightly between 1990 and 2014, with considerable regional variability. Although global usage is around 55%, it may be as low as 25% in Africa. Worldwide 222 million women have no or limited access to contraception. Some caution is needed in interpreting available data, since contraceptive prevalence is often defined as [...] "the percentage of women currently using any method of contraception among all women of reproductive age (i.e., those aged 15 to 49 years, unless otherwise stated) who are married or in a union. The “in-union” group includes women living with their partner in the same household and who are not married according to the marriage laws or customs of a country." [...] This definition is more suited to the more restrictive concept <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>planning,</b> but omits the contraceptive needs of all other women and girls who are or are likely to be sexually active, are at risk of pregnancy and are not married or [...] "in-union".|$|E
