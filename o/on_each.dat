5|$|Lesser Roman Catholic prelates use {{a variety}} of colors. Violet hats were once {{actually}} worn by certain monsignors, and so in heraldry they have used a violet hat with red or violet tassels in varying numbers, currently fixed at six <b>on</b> <b>each</b> side. The lowest grade of monsignor, a Chaplain of His Holiness, uses a black hat with violet tassels. The superior general of an order displays a black galero with six tassels <b>on</b> <b>each</b> side, while provincial superiors and abbots use a black galero with six or three tassels <b>on</b> <b>each</b> side, although Norbertines (White Canons) use a white galero. Although a priest would rarely assume arms unless he had an ancestral right to arms independent of his clerical state, a priest would use a simple black ecclesiastical hat with a single tassel <b>on</b> <b>each</b> side. Priests who hold an office such as rector would have two tassels <b>on</b> <b>each</b> side.|$|E

5|$|As planned, {{counterclockwise}} trains, to {{and from}} Jamaica and Howard Beach, would have run every 2 minutes during peak hours, for a frequency of 30 trains per hour (tph). Each branch would have been served by a train every four minutes, or 15 tph. The final environmental impact statement planned for even higher frequencies of 40 tph, or a train every 90 seconds in the central terminal area. However, , actual frequencies were much lower, with each branch being served by one train every 7 to 12 minutes during peak hours, or 5 to 8.5 tph. During middays, trains come every 10 to 15 minutes, with 4 to 6 tph <b>on</b> <b>each</b> branch. Late night service is less frequent: trains come every 15 to 20 minutes, with 3 to 4 tph <b>on</b> <b>each</b> branch. Weekend service is similar to night service, with trains coming every 16 minutes, or 4 tph <b>on</b> <b>each</b> branch. Trains make the journey between the terminals and either Jamaica or Howard Beach in about eight minutes.|$|E

5|$|Fishers {{have five}} toes <b>on</b> <b>each</b> foot, with unsheathed, {{retractable}} claws.

On the hind paws there are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking on a variety of surfaces. Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180 degrees, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first. The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.|$|E
