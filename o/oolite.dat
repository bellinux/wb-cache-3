5|$|The hill {{is formed}} in layers {{from a variety}} of {{sedimentary}} rocks of Jurassic age. In common with the Cotswold plateau to the north, the summit is formed from rocks ascribed to the Chalfield <b>Oolite</b> Formation. The <b>oolite</b> together with the Fuller's Earth Formation which underlies it, forms a part of the Great <b>Oolite</b> Group of rocks of Bathonian age. Beneath these are, successively, Bajocian age limestones of the Inferior <b>Oolite</b> Group and sandstones of the Bridport Sand Formation. The last-named unit forms a part of the Lias Group of rocks of Toarcian age. Beneath all of these is the relatively thick Charmouth Mudstone Formation sequence rising {{from the edge of the}} valley floor alluvium. All faces of the hill are subject to large areas of landslip.|$|E

40|$|Calcareous <b>oolites</b> {{occur in}} beach and {{continental}} shelf sediments from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to {{as far south}} as Palm Beach. The abundance of <b>oolites</b> in both shelf and beach sediments is highly irregular. In beach sediments the <b>oolites</b> tend to be significantly more abundant in backshore deposits than in foreshore deposits. This abundance is believed to be due to selective sorting with the <b>oolites</b> responding to flow as heavier particles because of their shape and surface smoothness. The source of the <b>oolites</b> in the beach deposits appears to be the inner continental shelf. Because of their highly irregular distribution and sensitivity to selective sorting processes, it is concluded that quantitative estimates of the total amount of sediment transported ashore with the <b>oolites</b> cannot be made.

50|$|Pellets {{differ from}} <b>oolites</b> and intraclasts, {{which are also}} found in limestones. They differ from <b>oolites</b> in that pellets lack the radial or {{concentric}} structures that characterize <b>oolites.</b> They differ from intraclasts in that pellets lack the complex internal structure, which is typical of intraclasts. In addition, pellets, quite unlike intraclasts, are characterized by a remarkable uniformity of shape, extremely good sorting, and small size.|$|R
5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden effigy with {{a copper}} crown {{was made for}} the funeral; {{this is the first}} known use of a funeral effigy in England, and was probably necessary because of the condition of the King's body, which had been dead for three months. Edward's heart was removed, placed in a silver container, and later buried with Isabella at Newgate Church in London. His tomb includes a very early example of an English alabaster effigy, with a tomb-chest and a canopy made of <b>oolite</b> and Purbeck stone. Edward was buried in the shirt, coif and gloves from his coronation, and his effigy depicts him as king, holding a sceptre and orb, and wearing a strawberry-leaf crown. The effigy features a pronounced lower lip, and may be a close likeness of Edward.|$|E
5|$|The {{geologic}} formations {{that have}} the most influence on the Everglades are the Miami Limestone and the Fort Thompson Formation. The Miami Limestone forms {{the floor of the}} lower Everglades. The Miami Limestone is made up of ooids: tiny formations of egg-shaped concentric shells and calcium carbonate, formed around a single grain of sand. The Miami Limestone was formerly named the Miami <b>Oolite,</b> which comprises facies of ooids and fossilized bryozoan organisms. The unique structure was some of the first material used in housing in early 20th-century South Florida. The composition of this sedimentary formation affects the hydrology, plant life, and wildlife above it: the rock is especially porous and stores water during the dry season in the Everglades, and its chemical composition determines the vegetation prevalent in the region. The Miami Limestone also acts as a dam between Fort Lauderdale and Coot Bay.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} castle {{centred on}} a stone tower-keep, measuring 60 feet by 24 feet (18 m by 7 m) internally and 54 feet (16 m) tall, with four round corner-towers. The tower-keep had eight-foot (2.4 m) thick walls made from Lias <b>Oolite</b> ashlar stone and was designed around three floors. The corner towers had conical roofs and prominent machicolations. The ground floor of the tower-house included the kitchen and other service areas. The functions {{of the first and}} second floors are uncertain; one theory is that the first floor was another service area, with the hall on the second floor; another approach argues that the first floor formed the hall, and the second floor living accommodation; a minority view proposes that the first floor was an armoury. The third floor was used as living accommodation for the owning family. The original design had a number of windows and fireplaces on the upper floors, but the hall would have been relatively dark and the stairs were inconveniently narrow.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] During the {{epigenetic}} {{alteration of}} boehmitic karstic bauxite in the Vlasenica region of Yu-goslavia, which {{was caused by}} siliceous water descending through the deposit by means of cracks, fissures, etc., <b>oolites</b> were less altered compared with the coexisting matrix material, which was intensely kaolinized. The following zonal alteration pattern of the <b>oolites</b> was identified: a diaspore nrichment zone, followed by a diaspore-boehmite enrichment zone, and then the original bauxite. Considering this alteration pattern and that determined previously for the matrix material, the following overall pattern of alteration was established: a kaolinite-diaspore zone, followed by a boehmite-diaspore zone, and then the original bauxite. The alteration solutions reacted with the bauxite to form solution-matrix and solution-oolite subsystems, which were characterized by different types of diffusion and geochemistry. In the kaolinite-diaspore zone Si-metasomatism kaolinized the matrix, and excess A 1 partly migrated into the <b>oolites,</b> forming diaspore, and outward into the bauxite. The latter Al-remobilization resulted in a transition zone, in which new boehmite was formed in both the matrix and the <b>oolites,</b> and diaspore only in the <b>oolites.</b> Thermodynamic models of <b>oolites</b> and whole bauxite alterations were established, {{on the basis of}} stability diagrams calculated for the mineral assemblages ofboth the <b>oolites</b> and the matrix, in the alteration zones and in the deposit as a whole. Based on these models, the genesis of the diaspore and the relationship of diaspore-boehrnite-kaolinite ass mblages in natural systems at low temperature and low pressure can be described...|$|R

5|$|The {{western end}} of the area (around Nempnett Thrubwell) {{consists}} of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified clay, shale and Lias Limestone. Clifton Down Limestone, which includes Calcite and Dolomitic mudstones of the Carboniferous period, {{is found in the}} adjoining central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. There are two main soil types, both generally well-drained. The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile silty clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high iron content. The clay content means that where unimproved they easily become waterlogged when wet, and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods. The main geological outcrops around the lake are Mudstone, largely consisting of red Siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of Sandstone of the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside the course of the River Chew. The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres (250–770ft). The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the scarp slopes. It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give the appearance of concrete. The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the Dundry Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior <b>Oolite</b> of the Jurassic period found on the higher ground around Maes Knoll. This overlays the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes. The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes. This area was once connected to the Cotswolds. The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau. The unusual geological features have been recognised as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for their geological interest including Barns Batch Spinney, Hartcliff Rocks Quarry and Dundry Main Road South Quarry.|$|E
25|$|Combe Down forms {{a plateau}} capped by Great <b>Oolite</b> limestones between {{the valley of}} the River Avon and Horsecombe Vale. The geology of the region is {{dominated}} by rocks of Middle and Early Jurassic ages. The Great <b>Oolite</b> is the uppermost lithology. This is underlain by the clays of the Fuller’s Earth Formation, which in turn is underlain by limestones of the Inferior <b>Oolite</b> and the Midford Sands of the Lias. The Great and Inferior <b>Oolite</b> formations provide effective aquifers (rock in which water can be stored and pass through) for public and private water supplies.|$|E

The monuments sit on the scarp of the Cotswold Hills, just as the scarp forms a ridge between the Stour valley to the north and the Swere valley to the south; geologically, this ridge had been formed from Chipping Norton limestone, itself a variant of the Great <b>Oolite</b> series of Jurassic limestone.|$|E
25|$|The geology of {{the area}} has {{dictated}} the land use. The soil comprises gravely clay, intermixed with flints, small pebbles and <b>öolite</b> over a chalk formation. Several examples of puddingstones a characteristic form of this aggregate have been found locally. There are no streams in the area due to the porous chalk sub soil. In places the occurrence of clay {{close to the surface}} accounts for several natural ponds fed by springs. Until connection with mains water in the mid-20th century, the scarcity of water had necessitated the sinking of deep wells and capture of rainwater.|$|E

It is named for the Tamiami Trail that follows the upper bedrock of the Big Cypress Swamp, and underlies the southern portion of the Everglades. Between the Tamiami Formation and Lake Okeechobee is the Caloosahatchee Formation, named for the river over it. Much less permeable, this formation is highly calcitic and is composed of sandy shell marl, clay, and sand. Water underneath the Caloosahatchee Formation is typically very mineralized.

500|$|Sleaford is the {{principal}} market town in the North Kesteven district of Lincolnshire. The civil parish includes the hamlet of Holdingham to the north east and the village of Quarrington to the south east, both of which merge with the town. The County Council's State of the Environment Report (1994) found that roughly three-quarters of Lincolnshire is low-lying, with much of it near sea-level; Sleaford lies approximately 43 feet (13 m) above sea level close to Lincoln Cliff, a Limestone scarp running north–south through Lindsey and Kesteven. The bedrock under the western half of the town belongs to the Great <b>Oolite</b> Group of Jurassic Sandstone, Limestone and Argillaceous rocks formed 168−165 million years ago; Kellaways and Oxford Clay formations, dated to 165–156 million years ago, underlie the eastern half. Alluvium deposits are found along the Slea's course, and Fen sand and gravel are found {{to the east and}} south. The county's agricultural land is generally of [...] "very good" [...] quality; as a result, intensive arable and vegetable farming is predominant and pastoral farming declined {{over the course of the}} 20th century.
