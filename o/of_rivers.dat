5|$|The Dinosaur Park Formation is {{interpreted}} as a low-relief setting <b>of</b> <b>rivers</b> and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific blue-eye (Pseudomugil signifer) is {{a species}} of fish in the family Pseudomugilidae native to eastern Australia.

5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Death Valley Pupfish swam to the area from the Colorado River via a long-since dried-up system <b>of</b> <b>rivers</b> and lakes (see Lake Manly). They now live in two separate populations: one in Salt Creek and another in Cottonball Marsh.

5|$|The long-toed {{salamander}} is an ecologically versatile species {{living in a}} variety of habitats, ranging from temperate rainforests, coniferous forests, montane riparian, sagebrush plains, red fir forest, semiarid sagebrush, cheatgrass plains, to alpine meadows along the rocky shores of mountain lakes. Adults can be located in forested understory, hiding under coarse woody debris, rocks, and in small mammal burrows. During the spring breeding season, adults can be found under debris or in the shoreline shallows <b>of</b> <b>rivers,</b> streams, lakes, and ponds. Ephemeral waters are often frequented.|$|E
5|$|The mythological kelpie {{is usually}} {{described}} as a powerful and beautiful black horse inhabiting the deep pools <b>of</b> <b>rivers</b> and streams of Scotland, preying on any humans it encounters, One of the water-kelpie's common identifying characteristics is that its hooves are reversed as compared to those of a normal horse, a trait also shared by the nykur of Iceland. An Aberdeenshire variation portrays the kelpie as a horse with a mane of serpents, whereas the resident equine spirit of the River Spey was white and could entice victims onto its back by singing.|$|E

5|$|The {{richness}} {{and diversity of}} the Solnhofen limestones in which all specimens of Archaeopteryx have been found have shed light on an ancient Jurassic Bavaria strikingly different from the present day. The latitude was similar to Florida, though the climate was {{likely to have been}} drier, as evidenced by fossils of plants with adaptations for arid conditions and a lack of terrestrial sediments characteristic <b>of</b> <b>rivers.</b> Evidence of plants, although scarce, include cycads and conifers while animals found include a large number of insects, small lizards, pterosaurs, and Compsognathus.|$|E
5|$|The tansy beetle has a Palearctic distribution. Evidence from archaeological {{excavation}} {{has shown}} that its presence in western Europe is confirmed at least {{as early as the}} Neolithic period. The beetles may be found on tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) and water mint (Mentha aquatica) in fen land and the banks <b>of</b> <b>rivers</b> with broad floodplains in Britain. Larvae are also recorded from other host plants: Achillea ptarmica (sneezewort) in France and various plants of the genus Artemisia in Russia. Adults and larvae feed on the leaves of their host plants.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis prefers lowland {{habitats}} (in Switzerland {{it occurs}} up to 275 m a.s.l.) and calcium-rich waters. This small snail inhabits {{the central and}} lower parts <b>of</b> <b>rivers</b> (up to 13 m deep), including in brackish water in tidal rivers of estuaries. It sometimes lives in lakes on unvegetated bottoms. Rarely, it lives in springs (rheocrenes), in ground water, and in caves. For example, in the Åland Islands, Theodoxus fluviatilis was found living in lakes with a pH of 7.8–8.9. In streams and rivers in Ireland, the species lived in water with a pH of 7.0–8.4.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} he painted September Morn, Paul Émile Chabas (1869–1937) already had an {{established}} reputation as an academic artist. He regularly submitted to the Paris Salon, first participating in 1886. He won a third class medal in the Salon of 1895, and four years later won the Prix National for his painting Joyeux ébats, which earned him a {{gold medal at the}} 1900 Exposition Universelle and was acquired by the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes. In subsequent years Chabas spent the winters working in Paris, while he passed his summers painting young women along the shores <b>of</b> <b>rivers,</b> lakes, and seas. In 1902 he was made a Chevalier in the Legion of Honour.|$|E
5|$|Dorset's diverse {{geography}} ensures it has {{an assortment}} <b>of</b> <b>rivers,</b> although a moderate annual rainfall coupled with rolling hills, means most are typically lowland in nature. Much of the county drains into three rivers, the Frome, Piddle and Stour which all flow to the sea in a south-easterly direction. The Frome and Piddle are chalk streams but the Stour, which rises in Wiltshire to the north, has its origins in clay soil. The River Avon, which flows mainly through Wiltshire and Hampshire, enters Dorset {{towards the end of}} its journey at Christchurch Harbour. The rivers Axe and Yeo, which principally drain the counties of Devon and Somerset respectively, have their sources in the north-west of the county. In the south-west, a number of small rivers run into the sea along the Dorset coastline; most notable of these are the Char, Brit, Bride and Wey.|$|E

5|$|For {{the purpose}} of water quality {{monitoring}} and improvement the river is divided into several catchment management areas; South of Malmesbury, Bristol Avon Rural and Bristol Avon Urban. In the rural area 22 water bodies are classified as good, 46 as moderated and 8 as poor. The main reasons for not achieving good scores are pollution from waste water, agriculture and rural land management. In the urban area one water body is rated good, while 12 are rated moderate and one is poor. The pollution from upstream is added to by the effects of industry, manufacturing and other businesses and is significantly affected by physical modifications to the water course. Within the catchment area there are 137 river water bodies and 6 lakes; of these 22 percent <b>of</b> <b>rivers</b> are rated as good ecological status, 40 percent good for chemical status and 31 percent good for biological status.|$|E
5|$|From the Glades peoples, {{two major}} nations {{emerged in the}} area: the Calusa and the Tequesta. The Calusa was {{the largest and most}} {{powerful}} nation in South Florida. It controlled fifty villages located on Florida's west coast, around Lake Okeechobee, and on the Florida Keys. Most Calusa villages were located at the mouths <b>of</b> <b>rivers</b> or on key islands. The Calusa were hunter-gatherers who lived on small game, fish, turtles, alligators, shellfish, and various plants. Most of their tools were made of bone or teeth, although sharpened reeds were also effective for hunting or war. Calusa weapons consisted of bows and arrows, atlatls, and spears. Canoes were used for transportation, and South Florida tribes often canoed through the Everglades, but rarely lived in them. Canoe trips to Cuba were also common.|$|E
5|$|Habitats {{change over}} time. This {{may be due}} to a violent event such as the {{eruption}} of a volcano, an earthquake, a tsunami, a wildfire or a change in oceanic currents; or the change may be more gradual over millennia with alterations in the climate, as ice sheets and glaciers advance and retreat, and as different weather patterns bring changes of precipitation and solar radiation. Other changes come {{as a direct result of}} human activities; deforestation, the ploughing of ancient grasslands, the diversion and damming <b>of</b> <b>rivers,</b> the draining of marshland and the dredging of the seabed. The introduction of alien species can have a devastating effect on native wildlife, through increased predation, through competition for resources or through the introduction of pests and diseases to which the native species have no immunity.|$|E
