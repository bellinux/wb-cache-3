25|$|Thus, Deleuze {{at times}} refers to his {{philosophy}} as a transcendental empiricism (empirisme transcendantal), alluding to Kant and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. In Kant's transcendental idealism, experience <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> when organized by forms of sensibility (namely, space, and time) and intellectual categories (such as causality). Assuming {{the content of}} these forms and categories to be qualities {{of the world as}} it exists independently of our perceptual access, according to Kant, spawns seductive but senseless metaphysical beliefs (for example, extending the concept of causality beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause). Deleuze inverts the Kantian arrangement: experience exceeds our concepts by presenting novelty, and this raw experience of difference actualizes an idea, unfettered by our prior categories, forcing us to invent new ways of thinking (see below, Epistemology).|$|E

PopMatters wrote, [...] "You can spend hours poring over the lyric sheet and attempting to grok Doom’s infinitely dense verbiage.
