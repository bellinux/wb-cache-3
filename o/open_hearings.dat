2500|$|The {{commission}} conducted thirty <b>open</b> <b>hearings</b> and 219 {{witnesses were}} interviewed [...] {{all but three}} in <b>open</b> <b>hearings.</b> Between the three commissions, 309 people were interviewed. The commission held 35 meetings and interviewed British officials, as well as visiting all relevant sites. It also considered all archived material from the first three investigations. The Chief of Defence of Norway declassified all military personnel from their professional secrecy regarding the incident. In addition, a number of documents with relevance to the case were declassified by the military. The aircraft wreckage had been buried after the initial investigation and it was therefore not possible for the fourth commission to investigate it. A search for parts {{was carried out in}} September 2003; a drop tank was found, but it was incompatible with those used by a Harrier.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{instructions}} of the Commission Parker then heard in public (poorly specified) {{charges against the}} master of the workhouse of diverting some of the paupers' rations for his own use, improper behaviour towards pauper girls, sleeping with inmates, conducting prayers when drunk, etc., but nothing relating to the bone-crushing. Parker was critical (many papers thought over-critical) of the prosecution witnesses, even criticising the workhouse medical officer for not keeping his books in the form prescribed by the Poor Law Commission, when the books were in the form directed by the Andover Guardians, and Parker was more demonstrably at fault since his routine duties included inspecting workhouse books to ensure that they met the Poor Law Commission's requirements. The hearings were adjourned to give {{the master of the}} workhouse time to prepare his defence and witnesses, but before the time allowed was up the Commissioners stopped the enquiry, recommended suspension of the master and (on the assumption that that recommendation would be acted upon) suggested complainants prosecute him on specimen charges at Quarter Sessions. The complainants declined; seeing this not as an escalation of proceedings, but an attempt to evade a verdict against the master, pointing out that whilst the charges against the master (if true) showed him unfit to hold his post, they were unlikely to support a conviction. [...] The Times, saying the behaviour of the Somerset House set was like that of a cheat at cards, held <b>open</b> <b>hearings</b> of witnesses to the bone-crushing and -gnawing. [...] The guardians voted not to suspend the master; his wife was however suspended, having physically attacked witnesses against her husband. The Commission then ordered the immediate resumption of the inquiry, allowing no further time for the master to prepare his defence.: the resumed enquiry was now attended by a shorthand writer taking an accurate record and reporting it to the Home Secretary (no accurate record of proceedings had previously been taken, leading to arguments about what previous witnesses had said). [...] No sooner had the enquiry resumed than it was terminated by the master's resignation.|$|E

50|$|Despite public {{pressure}} for <b>open</b> <b>hearings,</b> the Senate ultimately decided against them.

2500|$|Another loyalty {{investigation}} of Remington was opened early in 1948, and in June, {{he was relieved}} of his duties pending the findings of that investigation.

[...] At his loyalty review hearings, Remington downplayed his earlier connections with Communist and leftist organizations and claimed that his wife's adherence to Communist doctrine was the reason for the end of their marriage.|$|R
50|$|Assisted by {{interpreter}} and Sub-Protector of Aborigines George Clarke, then aged 19, Spain {{began his}} hearings in Wellington in May 1842.

In fact Spain was determined to investigate thoroughly the background of all land purchases including whether Maori who had sold land {{had the right to}} do so. His interrogation of witnesses was exhaustive, with lengthy evidence taken and recorded in both Maori and English. Spain held further hearings in Porirua, Waikanae, Otaki, Manawatu and Wanganui and then Taranaki, where his commission <b>opened</b> <b>hearings</b> on 31 May 1844.|$|R

50|$|After {{experiencing}} some missteps in {{her campaign}} {{to bring about}} temperance instruction by persuading local school boards to have it taught, Hunt developed the strategy of having WCTU members pressure state legislators to mandate temperance instruction and to promote the nomination and candidacy of pro-temperance candidates in election years.

50|$|Early in 1950, When Senator Joseph McCarthy {{began his}} anti-communist purges, {{he found a}} lot of support from the public at large and his colleagues. By 1952 however, some of his attacks had helped lead to defeat of Democratic opponents and even {{resulted}} in criticism from some of his own party for debasing the decorum required of a public official. By 1953, with the Republican sweep in the White House and legislatures his attacks had become an assault on his own party. On 22 April 1954, McCarthy <b>opened</b> <b>hearings</b> to investigate the security of the US Army. Aired on national television, McCarthy badgered witnesses, ignored common courtesies, subverted parliamentary procedure, and negatively turned public opinion against himself and the government.|$|R
500|$|On 9 August 1967 the Senate Armed Services Committee <b>opened</b> <b>hearings</b> on {{the bombing}} campaign. Complaints from the armed {{services}} had sparked the interest {{of some of the}} most vocal hawks on Capitol Hill. The military chiefs testified before the committee, complaining about the gradual nature of the air war and its civilian-imposed restrictions. It was obvious that McNamara, the only civilian subpoenaed and the last to testify before the committee, was to be the scapegoat. The Secretary of Defense marshaled his objections to an indiscriminate air war and adeptly rebutted the charges of the military chiefs. He bluntly admitted that there was [...] "no basis to believe that any bombing campaign...would by itself force Ho Chi Minh's regime into submission, short, that is, of the virtual annihilation of North Vietnam and its people." ...|$|R
