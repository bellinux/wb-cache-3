5|$|First {{introduced}} in FreeBSD version 4, jails is a security mechanism and an implementation of operating-system-level virtualization {{that enables the}} user to run multiple instances of a guest operating system {{on top of a}} FreeBSD host.

A process that runs within such a jail is unable to access the resources <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Every jail has its own hostname and IP address. It is possible to run multiple jails at the same time, but the kernel is shared among all of them. Hence only software supported by the FreeBSD kernel can be run within a jail.|$|E
5|$|Though three-faced Vishnu {{images from}} the Mathura school exist from the Gupta period, not a single four-faced Vaikuntha Chaturmurti from this era is found till day.

An alternate theory dates Jayakhya-Samhita to c. 600-850 CE and suggests that the three-faced Vishnu images of Gupta era as well as Gupta icons of Vishvarupa (another form of Vishnu) inspired the iconography of the Vaikuntha Chaturmurti, which developed in Kashmir in the 8th century and attached the fourth head {{on the back of the}} older icon of a three-faced Vishnu.

25|$|However it {{cannot be}} stated affirmatively where {{the mind of}} an arahant exists or that it exists at all, because {{describing}} an arahant's mind in terms of existence would limit it to the confines of time and space, which Nirvana occurs <b>outside</b> <b>of.</b> <b>It</b> would be equally incorrect {{to say that the}} mind of an arahant does not exist — the Buddha said that the idea of existence or non-existence “does not apply” to the behavior of an arahant's mind.
