In the gate of the projector head, there is no space for a reader, and the film is not travelling smoothly at the gate position.

40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{prototype}} of an open source, <b>optical</b> fingerprint <b>reader,</b> called RaspiReader, using ubiquitous components. RaspiReader, a low-cost and easy to assemble reader, provides the fingerprint research community a seamless and simple method for gaining {{more control over the}} sensing component of fingerprint recognition systems. In particular, we posit that this versatile fingerprint reader will encourage researchers to explore novel spoof detection methods that integrate both hardware and software. RaspiReader's hardware is customized with two cameras for fingerprint acquisition with one camera providing high contrast, frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) images, and the other camera outputting direct images. Using both of these image streams, we extract complementary information which, when fused together, results in highly discriminative features for fingerprint spoof (presentation attack) detection. Our experimental results demonstrate a marked improvement over previous spoof detection methods which rely only on FTIR images provided by COTS <b>optical</b> <b>readers.</b> Finally, fingerprint matching experiments between images acquired from the FTIR output of the RaspiReader and images acquired from a COTS fingerprint reader verify the interoperability of the RaspiReader with existing COTS <b>optical</b> <b>readers.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 14 figure...|$|R

40|$|As the {{prevalence}} of febrile illnesses continues to increase, {{there is a growing}} need for reliable, low-cost means of diagnosing these diseases. To address this, a highly sensitive point-of-care fluorescence lateral flow immunoassay is being developed to diagnose dengue in its earliest stages. Through use of different fluorescent labels, multiplexed test strips will eventually be created to test for several diseases simultaneously. To quantify the resulting signals produced by the assay, a corresponding <b>optical</b> <b>reader</b> was designed, built, and tested in accordance with design thinking principles. The effectiveness of the design was verified through usability testing. The reader works in conjunction with software run on any internet-enabled device to take an image of a test strip and analyze the signal levels by comparing them to predetermined calibration curves.

40|$|We {{open source}} an easy to assemble, spoof resistant, high resolution, <b>optical</b> {{fingerprint}} <b>reader,</b> called RaspiReader, using ubiquitous components. By using our open source STL files and software, RaspiReader {{can be built}} in under one hour for only US $ 175. As such, RaspiReader provides the fingerprint research community a seamless and simple method for quickly prototyping new ideas involving fingerprint reader hardware. In particular, we posit that this open source fingerprint reader will facilitate the exploration of novel fingerprint spoof detection techniques involving both hardware and software. We demonstrate one such spoof detection technique by specially customizing RaspiReader with two cameras for fingerprint image acquisition. One camera provides high contrast, frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) fingerprint images, and the other outputs direct images of the finger {{in contact with the}} platen. Using both of these image streams, we extract complementary information which, when fused together and used for spoof detection, results in marked performance improvement over previous methods relying only on grayscale FTIR images provided by COTS <b>optical</b> <b>readers.</b> Finally, fingerprint matching experiments between images acquired from the FTIR output of RaspiReader and images acquired from a COTS reader verify the interoperability of the RaspiReader with existing COTS <b>optical</b> <b>readers.</b> Comment: substantial text overlap with arXiv: 1708. 0788...|$|R
