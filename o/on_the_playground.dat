500|$|The {{anniversary of}} the game was not widely commemorated until its silver anniversary in 1987. By that time, the NBA had grown to be a popular sports league with average {{attendance}} of 13,000 fans per game and star players like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan. The Warriors' PR director Harvey Pollack said an impossible 40,000 people claimed to have seen the game, and some even testified it took place in Madison Square Garden. Chamberlain later stated {{it was one of}} his favorite games, but not the favorite: that title belonged to the match in which he grabbed an NBA record 55 rebounds against perennial rival Bill Russell. He did not want to feed the criticism that he was more interested in personal stardom than winning. Although Chamberlain won two NBA championships and was the NBA's all-time leading scorer and rebounder when he retired, he was mostly remembered as the man who had single-handedly scored 100 points in a game. Chamberlain publicly embraced the 100-point game in his final years. On a radio show commemorating the game's 31st anniversary in 1993, he said, [...] "As time goes by, I feel more a part of that 100-point game." [...] He explained that growing up on the streets, he would have been derisively labelled a gunner, a glory-hound, for attempting 63shots. [...] "You take that many shots <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>playground,</b> and no one ever wants you on their team again." [...] He said he took shots he normally would not, noting that in contests which he considered to be better he scored 50 to 60 points on around 75 percent shooting, as opposed to his 57 percent shooting in the 100-point game. He was proud that people who knew nothing about basketball would point out the game to their kids when they saw him. [...] "I know that it has been my tag. I am definitely proud of it. But it was definitely a team effort. You had {{to see some of the}} things my teammates did to get me the ball ... It was almost like a circus out there for a while." ...|$|E

40|$|Early {{childhood}} {{is a crucial}} period for the physical and cognitive development of children. A child 2 ̆ 7 s exposure to nature is proven to be beneficial in this period of human life. The aim of the present research was to investigate children’s play and physical activity on a traditional playground and on a forest (natural) playground. Twenty-five observations took place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> traditional <b>playground,</b> and twenty-five observations were recorded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forest <b>playground.</b> Twenty-five participating preschool children were observed in both playgrounds, but not necessarily in the same order. Research findings confirmed important qualities of natural playgrounds that provide children {{with a wide range}} of playing and learning opportunities not available on other playgrounds. Children were playing more with different natural materials in <b>the</b> forest <b>playground</b> and they more frequently played different chasing games and hide and seek in <b>the</b> forest <b>playground.</b> Participating children were also more physically active <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forest <b>playground,</b> and boys were more active <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forest <b>playground</b> than girls. <b>The</b> research concludes that it is important for preschool teachers to use natural playgrounds frequently and with regularity.

Ofcom stated that the language used could have been [...] "interpreted by listeners as promoting and condoning certain negative stereotypes based on sexual orientation" [...] and whilst acknowledging the intention was to be humorous in their opinion it could have been perceived as hostile and pejorative. The media regulator also said in their view that because of the show's breakfast time slot that attracts a young audience it had the potential to encourage children to discriminate against others based on their actual or perceived sexual orientation and ran the risk of being imitated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>playground</b> causing [...] "unnecessary distress".|$|E

His {{earliest}} recollections were of taking short walks with his grandfather when he was three. In his autobiography, he described his boyhood pursuits, which included fighting, either by re-enacting romantic battles from the Wars of Scottish Independence or just scrapping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>playground,</b> and hunting for birds' nests (ostensibly to one-up his fellows as they compared notes on who knew where the most were located). Author Amy Marquis notes that he began his [...] "love affair" [...] with nature while young, and implies {{that it may have}} been in reaction to his strict religious upbringing. [...] "His father believed that anything that distracted from Bible studies was frivolous and punishable." [...] But the young Muir was a [...] "restless spirit" [...] and especially [...] "prone to lashings." [...] As a young boy, Muir became fascinated with the East Lothian landscape, and was known {{to spend a lot of}} time wandering the local coastline and countryside. It was during this time that he became interested in natural history and the works of Scottish naturalist Alexander Wilson.|$|E

2500|$|The {{final section}} is [...] "The Pain" [...] which explores the {{difficulty}} piecing together one's {{life after the}} destruction and demise of a relationship through [...] "distraught" [...] lyricism and melancholic pop. The section opens with the [...] "thunderous" [...] electropop power-ballad [...] "Thousand Miles", which lyrically depicts Lo's obsession with reuniting with her lost love at all costs, {{even if it means}} running [...] "a thousand miles". Musically, the mid-tempo track tells a story of a girl [...] "struggling to forget a rocky relationship with an ex," [...] and is sonically amped up by the singer’s [...] "emotionally distraught" [...] vocals and [...] "thundering" [...] drum rhythms. The following song, [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] sees her emotionally unravel even more, as she talks about self-medicating by smoking marijuana to cope to live without her lover. It's [...] "snappy" [...] verses are filled with [...] "quietly distinct, often strange imagery", including Lo eating her dinner in the bathtub, getting drunken munchies, and seducing dads <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>playground.</b> Musically, it is a Purity Ring-inspired song, and creates a calming atmosphere compared to that of morphine. [...] "This Time Around" [...] is a dark Charli XCX-inspired track which reflects on the lessons learned from a heartbreak. Lo's vocal performance on the song has been described as particularly yearning and broken. The final song of the section and album is [...] "Run on Love", an [...] "easy-going" [...] reworked nu-disco dance collaboration with EDM producer Lucas Nord. Lyrically, Lo sings of picking up her heart and choosing to no longer be a victim by living in the moment enjoy time with her lover before it runs out.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is also a}} Cherokee {{language}} immersion school in Tahlequah, Oklahoma that educates students from pre-school through eighth grade. Students actively speak the language, using it in all settings: <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>playground,</b> in the classroom, in sports [...] and in technology. At the school, posters showing countries, planets, {{parts of the body}} and the Pledge of Allegiance are all written in letters from the Cherokee syllabary. As of 2014, elderly monolingual Cherokee speakers are assisting in language preservation efforts and help the tribe develop education materials for the school. Because Oklahoma's official language is English, Cherokee immersion students are hindered when taking state-mandated tests because they have little competence in English. The Department of Education of Oklahoma said that in 2012 state tests: 11% of the school’s sixth-graders showed proficiency in math, and 25% showed proficiency in reading; 31% of the seventh-graders showed proficiency in math, and 87% showed proficiency in reading; 50% of the eighth-graders showed proficiency in math, and 78% showed proficiency in reading. The Oklahoma Department of Education listed the charter school as a Targeted Intervention school, meaning the school was identified as a low-performing school but has not so that it was a Priority School. Ultimately, the school made a C, or a 2.33 grade point average on the state’s A-F report card system. The report card shows the school getting an F in mathematics achievement and mathematics growth, a C in social studies achievement, a D in reading achievement, and an A in reading growth and student attendance. “The C we made is tremendous,” said school principal Holly Davis, “here is no English instruction in our school’s younger grades, and we gave them this test in English.” She said she had anticipated the low grade because it was the school’s first year as a state-funded charter school, and many students had difficulty with English. Eighth graders who graduate from the Tahlequah immersion school are fluent speakers of the language, and they usually go on to attend Sequoyah High School where classes are taught in both English and Cherokee. Other high schools in Oklahoma offer Cherokee and other Indian languages as second languages to count toward a foreign language requirement, and thousands of students, both indigenous and non-indigenous, enroll in classes. In North Carolina, the North Carolina House of Representatives has passed a state bill which mandates the requirement of constituent institutions of the University of North Carolina to recognize Cherokee as a language for which a student may satisfy a foreign language course requirement for degree completion. The bill was introduced by North Carolina Senators Jim Davis and Andrew Brock and was passed in the North Carolina Senate on May 13, 2013.|$|E
