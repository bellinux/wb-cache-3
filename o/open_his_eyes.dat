5|$|To {{convince}} {{the rest of}} the colony, Peter and Thea plan to use a piece of mythology, that a dog with four white paws would be supposedly born {{when it was time to}} leave. Such a dog had been born several days ago but has yet to <b>open</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> Thea decides to proceed without using the dog and tries to {{convince the}} colony at a reenactment of the Settler's escape to Greenland with several allies who know of Rowen's actions. Just as Thea and her allies are about to lose the argument, Peter arrives with the dog, whose eyes are open. That, coupled with the fact that Peter is an eye adept, the first in a hundred years, convinces the colony to listen to Thea instead of Rowen. The novel ends eight months later as the people of Gracehope are slowly educated on global warming and the dangers of staying in their colony.|$|E
25|$|Kwan {{introduces}} Hamilton to Jill Bryant (Sigourney Weaver), {{a beautiful}} young assistant at the British embassy.

Discovering that the Communist Chinese are arming the PKI, Bryant passes this information to Hamilton to save his life, but he wants to cover the Communist rebellion that will occur when the arms shipment reaches Jakarta.

500|$|Another {{scene in}} which Ottman meshed his editing and {{composing}} duties was when Dussander wakes {{up in the hospital}} with the television show The Jeffersons playing in the background. Ottman explained his intent for the scene, [...] "I used The Jeffersons as this innocuous thing—going between him and the television—so that when he does <b>open</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> it scares the hell out of you... I added this deafening Bartok pizz, which is when all the violins pluck their strings really loud and they create this gnarly, unsettling sound." [...] Ottman recorded the film's score with the Seattle Symphony.|$|E

500|$|His pleas were in vain. [...] Three days later, Digby, Robert Wintour, John Grant and Thomas Bates were hanged, {{drawn and}} {{quartered}} {{at the western}} end of St Paul's churchyard. [...] The following day, Rookwood, Thomas Wintour, Robert Keyes and Guy Fawkes were tied to wattled hurdles and dragged by horse from the Tower, to the Old Palace Yard at Westminster—a longer route than had been suffered by their fellow conspirators. [...] Rookwood had asked to be informed when he passed by his lodgings in the Strand, so that he could <b>open</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and see his wife, waiting at the window. [...] He shouted [...] "Pray for me, pray for me!" [...] According to Father Gerard (who was not then present), Elizabeth answered, [...] "I will, and be of good courage. [...] Offer theyself wholly to God. [...] I, for my part, do as freely restore thee to God as He gave thee unto me." [...] For the rest of the journey he kept his eyes closed, in prayer. [...] Thomas Wintour was the first that day to be hanged and then killed. [...] Rookwood was next, and made a short speech to the assembled audience. [...] He was repentant, asking God to bless the king, queen, and their [...] "royal progeny", but [...] "spoil all the pottage with one filthy weed" [...] by beseeching God to make the king a Catholic. [...] Nevertheless, he seems to have been left to hang for longer than the others, before suffering the remainder of his grim sentence.|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, Matsumoto {{suffered}} {{the last of}} a series of strokes, and was hospitalized, never to fully regain consciousness again. The stylish Matsumoto had been famously fastidious throughout his life, and his daughter, Meiko, has written that she was startled to notice that on his hospital bed, where Matsumoto lay unconscious and barely responsive, he had been using his remaining good hand to remove the pills that had formed on the old hospital blanket. Furthermore, although doctors said he had lost his sight, Matsumoto would <b>open</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and, as if looking in a mirror, would straighten the hairs of his mustache with his fingers as he had habitually done for years. [...] Matsumoto {{died at the age of}} 81. His cremated remains are interred in the Fuji Cemetery in Gotemba, Shizuoka, at the foot of Mount Fuji.|$|E
