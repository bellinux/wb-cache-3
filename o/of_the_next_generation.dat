5|$|Sigurd {{was in the}} {{fortunate}} position that on his accession to the earldom there {{seem to have been}} no other serious contenders.

5|$|This was {{the first}} {{appearance}} <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Generation</b> era Starfleet dress uniforms. They were based on those used by the Royal Navy in the 18th century but would be slightly altered when they re-appeared during season two. One piece of a costume introduced in this episode which never returned was the surgical cap and eyepiece worn by Doctor Crusher.|$|E
5|$|Director Hifumi Kono was not {{interested}} in developing a sequel to the original Clock Tower at first, but was swayed after seeing the technical possibilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> consoles. Kono had difficulty in choosing the platform to develop on, but eventually settled for the new PlayStation despite its uncertain future. Clock Tower {{was one of the first}} games developed by Human Entertainment to utilize a 3D graphics engine. The team felt challenged to create high-quality graphics after being impressed by the visuals of Resident Evil (1996), which was announced during development.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, Lipsett {{responded to}} the call from the Colonial Office for young staff {{officers}} to operate in colonial military academies, as military education had been standardised throughout the British Empire in 1909. Lipsett was sent to Canada and promoted to major (in 1913), working hard to improve training in the Dominion. He instigated numerous new training courses and special schools, establishing close ties with the Canadian military establishment and personally training most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> of Canadian staff officers and generals.|$|E
5|$|After the Glorious Revolution, Wright, a Jacobite, {{fell out}} of favour at the royal court. The Flemish-Spanish painter John Baptist Medina (1659–1710) came to Scotland in 1693 and became the leading Scottish {{portrait}} painter of his generation. Among his best known works are {{a group of about}} 30 oval bust-lengths, including a self-portrait, in Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh. He trained his son, also John, and William Aikman (1682–1731), who became the leading Scottish portrait-painter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation.</b> Aikman migrated to London in 1723, and from this point until the late eighteenth century, most Scottish painters of note followed him.|$|E
5|$|Donald Petrie was {{originally}} signed {{to direct the}} episode, but dropped out to direct the film Mystic Pizza. Executive producer Robert Justman brought in Rob Bowman to direct his first Star Trek episode. Justman later {{said that this was}} one of his most-significant achievements on The Next Generation. Bowman worked on storyboards and set blocking for twenty days before shooting the episode. He was initially nervous about working on the show, and felt he had to prove himself because of his relative inexperience as a director. Bowman said that after the second day of filming it became easier, and credited the crew with making him feel welcome. He went on to direct twelve more episodes <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Generation.</b>|$|E

5|$|Florence at {{the time}} of Leonardo's youth was the centre of Christian Humanist thought and culture. Leonardo {{commenced}} his apprenticeship with Verrocchio in 1466, the year that Verrocchio's master, the great sculptor Donatello, died. The painter Uccello, whose early experiments with perspective were to influence the development of landscape painting, was a very old man. The painters Piero della Francesca and Filippo Lippi, sculptor Luca della Robbia, and architect and writer Leon Battista Alberti were in their sixties. The successful artists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> were Leonardo's teacher Verrocchio, Antonio del Pollaiuolo and the portrait sculptor Mino da Fiesole, whose lifelike busts give the most reliable likenesses of Lorenzo Medici's father Piero and uncle Giovanni.|$|E
5|$|John Eaves, who had {{previously}} worked on Star Trek: First Contact, became the Senior Illustrator for the show, while Doug Drexler worked to him as Junior Illustrator. Michael Westmore was once again the Head of Make-up for the series, and was joined by his daughter-in-law Suzanne Westmore, who {{had previously}} been credited on Voyager as Suzanne Diaz. Ronald B. Moore returned once again as Visual Effectors Supervisor, a veteran of Trek productions since The Next Generation and also worked on the feature film Star Trek Generations. Carol Kuntz was the Costume Supervisor, a position she had held since the production <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Generation,</b> while Charlotte A. Parker was Enterprises Hair Stylist, and had been previously credited as Charlotte A. Gravenor on Voyager.|$|E
5|$|Next, Paramount {{sought to}} consult {{franchise}} creator Gene Roddenberry. He {{turned down the}} idea of running the show, given the time that production of The Original Series had distracted him from his family. But Paramount {{told him that it}} was impossible to pursue the new series otherwise, Roddenberry began to make plans for the series—with a new cast, as he wanted to avoid retreading and recreating the same roles now seen in the film franchise. Although they had not planned on it originally, Paramount hired Roddenberry to oversee the production and fired Strangis. However, one of his ideas appeared in the premise <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Generation,</b> that the Federation and the Klingons had become allies. The first announcement of a new series was made by Roddenberry publicly on October 10, 1986.|$|E

5|$|According to Hinduism, {{the souls}} of three {{preceding}} generations of one's ancestor reside in Pitru–loka, a realm between heaven and earth. This realm is governed by Yama, the god of death, who takes {{the soul of a}} dying man from earth to Pitru–loka. When a person <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> dies, the first generation shifts to heaven and unites with God, so Shraddha offerings are not given. Thus, only the three generations in Pitru–loka are given Shraddha rites, in which Yama plays a significant role. According to the sacred Hindu epics, at the beginning of Pitru Paksha, the sun enters the zodiac sign of Libra (Tula). Coinciding with this moment, it is believed that the spirits leave Pitru–loka and reside in their descendants' homes for a month until the sun enters the next zodiacScorpio (Vrichchhika)and there is a full moon. Hindus are expected to propitiate the ancestors in the first half, during the dark fortnight.|$|E
5|$|By {{the seventeenth}} century the fashion for {{portraiture}} had spread down the social order to lairds such as Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and John Napier of Merchiston. The first significant native artist was George Jamesone of Aberdeen (1589/90-1644), who, having trained in the Netherlands, {{became one of the}} most successful portrait painters of the reign of Charles I. He trained the Baroque artist John Michael Wright (1617–94), who painted both Scottish and English subjects. The Flemish-Spanish painter John Baptist Medina (1659–1710) came to Scotland in 1693 and became the leading Scottish portrait painter of his generation.

5|$|In July 2007, DiBiase {{signed a}} {{developmental}} deal with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and debuted in their training territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). He made his FCW debut on August 4 in a tag team match, {{in which he}} and Jake Hager defeated Keith Walker and Heath Miller. In October, DiBiase became a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Generation</b> Hart Foundation faction alongside Harry Smith, TJ Wilson, Nattie Neidhart, and Teddy Hart. He quickly separated from the group, however, and gained Maryse as a valet. On December 18, 2007, DiBiase defeated TJ Wilson to win the FCW Southern Heavyweight Championship in New Port Richey, Florida. DiBiase, however, was unable to defend it due to an injury sustained, so he awarded the championship to his partner Heath Miller on January 19, 2008. As of March 2008, DiBiase had suffered from a multitude of injuries including sciatica, a fractured left knee, separated ribs, broken finger, and bone spurs in his elbow. Due to these injuries, DiBiase competed sporadically in FCW {{for the next few}} months, competing in both tag team and singles competition.|$|E
5|$|On January 5, 2007, Neidhart {{signed a}} {{contract}} with WWE. Upon signing she was assigned to their developmental territory Deep South Wrestling {{for the first half of}} the year, competing against wrestlers including Krissy Vaine and Angel Williams. She was briefly transferred to Florida Championship Wrestling when it opened in June, and then moved to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), debuting in a dark match at the television tapings on July 18, 2007, where she won a battle royal. She debuted the next week as a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Generation</b> Hart Foundation, accompanying her cousins Teddy Hart and Harry Smith for tag team matches. In September, she and the rest of the Hart Foundation were moved back to FCW. Initially, Neidhart formed an alliance with Victoria Crawford to take on The Bella Twins (Nikki and Brie Bella), but in 2008, the pair began competing against one another, either in singles matches or in tag team matches with various partners. She continued to make appearances in FCW in late 2008, after debuting on SmackDown, and managed TJ Wilson and DH Smith (Harry Smith) to the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship on October 30.|$|E
5|$|The first 13-episode series {{concluded}} on 24 October 2005. With {{the success}} of the programme in the UK, Animal Planet began broadcasting Meerkat Manor on its national channels in Australia, Canada, and the United States. The programme premiered in the United States on 9 June 2006, with the first series airing through 25 August 2006. The second series aired simultaneously in both the US and the UK, starting 29 September 2006. The third series premiered in the US on 10 August 2007, followed in the UK on 10 September 2007, and in Canada on 3 October 2007. Because each channel had different broadcasting schedules, the UK sequence of new episodes ended well before those in the US and Canada. The fourth, and final, series premiered in the United States on 6 June 2008 with the subtitle <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Generation.</b> It was originally slated to begin airing in the United Kingdom in February 2009, but the premiere was later moved to April 2009.|$|E

5|$|The only {{surviving}} Hellenistic epic, the Argonautica of Apollonius of Rhodes (epic poet, scholar, {{and director}} of the Library of Alexandria) tells the myth of the voyage of Jason and the Argonauts to retrieve the Golden Fleece from the mythical land of Colchis. In the Argonautica, Jason is impelled on his quest by king Pelias, who receives a prophecy that a man with one sandal would be his nemesis. Jason loses a sandal in a river, arrives at the court of Pelias, and the epic is set in motion. Nearly every member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> of heroes, as well as Heracles, went with Jason in the ship Argo to fetch the Golden Fleece. This generation also included Theseus, who went to Crete to slay the Minotaur; Atalanta, the female heroine, and Meleager, who once had an epic cycle of his own to rival the Iliad and Odyssey. Pindar, Apollonius and the Bibliotheca endeavor to give full lists of the Argonauts.|$|E
5|$|They {{were joined}} by Robert Lewin as writing producer, based on a {{recommendation}} by Justman {{who had worked with}} him previously. Lewin {{was the first person to}} be involved in the series who did not have a background working on the franchise. D. C.

Non-writing staff who were brought from working on the film franchise included Rick Sternbach and Andrew Probert, as well as Michael Okuda who was hired as a scenic artist. Roddenberry hired costume designer William Ware Theiss, who had designed The Original Series costumes, while Milkis and Justman recruited art director Herman Zimmerman. Rick Berman joined the team as the liaison between Roddenberry's team and Paramount Television.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's small {{majority}} {{after the}} 1964 general election {{had made the}} transaction of government business difficult, and in 1966 he called another election in which Labour gained a strong working majority of 96. Some older members of Heath's team, including Lloyd, retired from the front bench, making room for members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation.</b> Heath moved Maudling to the foreign affairs portfolio, and Douglas-Home took over Lloyd's responsibilities as spokesman on Commonwealth relations. Heath was widely seen as ineffective against Wilson, and as the 1970 general election approached there was concern within the party that he would lose, and that Powell would seek to replace him as leader. Maudling and the chief whip, William Whitelaw, believed that if Heath had to resign Douglas-Home would be the safest candidate to keep Powell out. Douglas-Home shared their view that Labour would win the 1970 election, and that Heath might then have to resign, but he declined to commit himself. To the surprise of almost everyone except Heath, the Conservatives won the election, with a majority of 31 seats.|$|E
