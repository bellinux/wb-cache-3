5|$|After he {{was told}} that the Dutch had {{followed}} him, Tiku ordered most of his followers to return to Tondon while he and a group of fifteen, including his two wives, continued south.

This fortress fell at the end of March 1907 and Tiku began to work his way back to Tondon through the forest. He and the <b>other</b> <b>leaders,</b> Buginese and Torajan alike, were chased by Dutch troops.

Black Hawk and <b>other</b> <b>leaders</b> escaped, but later surrendered and were imprisoned for a year.|$|E
5|$|From 1517, {{during the}} years of Ottoman control, custody of the Basilica was bitterly disputed between the Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches. By the end of the 16th century, Bethlehem had become one of the largest villages in the District of Jerusalem, and was {{subdivided}} into seven quarters. The Basbus family served as the heads of Bethlehem among <b>other</b> <b>leaders</b> during this period. The Ottoman tax record and census from 1596 indicates that Bethlehem had a population of 1,435, making it the 13th largest village in Palestine at the time.

Żółkiewski was a known supporter of Cossack grievances, and generally favored peaceful negotiations with them. When the Cossacks surrendered Nalivaiko and <b>other</b> <b>leaders</b> of the uprising to him he guaranteed their fair treatment. But Nalivaiko was subsequently executed in Warsaw, and a mob of Polish soldiers massacred the other prisoners, {{which led to a}} deterioration in Polish-Cossack relations.

5|$|Leaders of the ACLU {{were divided}} on the best tactics to use to promote civil liberties. Felix Frankfurter felt that {{legislation}} was the best long-term solution, because the Supreme Court could not (andin his opinionshould not) mandate liberal interpretations of the Bill of Rights. But Walter Pollack, Morris Ernst, and <b>other</b> <b>leaders</b> felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee civil liberties. A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold a changing national atmosphere; anti-radical emotions were diminishing, {{and there was a}} growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII's {{underestimation}} of Bonaparte proved disastrous. On 19 March, {{the army}} stationed outside Paris defected to Bonaparte, leaving the city vulnerable to attack. That same day, Louis XVIII quit the capital {{with a small}} escort at midnight. Louis decided to go first to Lille, and then crossed the border into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, staying in Ghent. <b>Other</b> <b>leaders,</b> most prominently Alexander I of Russia, debated whether {{in the case of}} a second victory over the French Empire, the Duke of Orléans should be proclaimed king instead of Louis XVIII.|$|E

5|$|Seizing the {{opportunity}} the predicament presented, Eisenhower used Patton as a decoy in Operation Fortitude, sending faulty intelligence to German agents that Patton {{was leading the}} Invasion of Europe. While Patton eventually returned to combat command in the European Theater in mid-1944, the slapping incidents were seen by Eisenhower, Marshall, and <b>other</b> <b>leaders</b> to be examples of Patton's brashness and impulsiveness. Patton's career was halted as former subordinates such as Omar Bradley became his superiors.|$|E

5|$|The {{publicity}} from Sanger's trial generated immense {{enthusiasm for}} the cause, {{and by the end}} of 1917 there were over 30 birth control organizations in the United States.Engelman, p. 92. Sanger was always astute about public relations, and she seized on the publicity of the trial to advance her causes.Kennedy pp. 84, 181.Engelman, pp. 92–93. In her memoirs, Sanger often understated or entirely omitted the contributions of fellow activists. After her trial, she emerged as the movement's most visible leader. <b>Other</b> <b>leaders,</b> such as William J. Robinson, Mary Dennett, and Blanche Ames Ames, could not match Sanger's charisma, charm and fervor.|$|E
5|$|As Farmer's {{reputation}} grew, he {{expanded from}} bebop into more experimental forms through working with composers such as George Russell and Teddy Charles. He {{went on to}} join Gerry Mulligan's quartet and, with Benny Golson, to co-found the Jazztet. Continuing to develop his own sound, Farmer switched from trumpet to the warmer flugelhorn in the early 1960s, and he helped to establish the flugelhorn as a soloist's instrument in jazz. He settled in Europe in 1968 and continued to tour internationally until his death. Farmer recorded more than 50 albums under his own name, a dozen with the Jazztet, and dozens more with <b>other</b> <b>leaders.</b> His playing {{is known for its}} individuality – most noticeably, its lyricism, warmth of tone and sensitivity.|$|E
5|$|As {{a ranking}} prisoner-of-war, Colonel Stacy {{was the subject}} of {{high-level}} correspondence and actions of General George Washington and <b>other</b> <b>leaders</b> of the Continental Army. During April 1780, General Lafayette, who fought with the Americans during the Revolution, hand-carried a letter from General William Heath to General Washington, describing a reported Loyalist and British strategy concerning Stacy. The strategy was to continue holding Colonel Stacy as a prisoner-of-war, and to use Stacy in a prisoner exchange, should Colonel Butler or another ranking Loyalist officer, Sir John Johnson, be captured by the Continental Army. During September 1780, General Washington attempted to arrange a prisoner exchange for Colonel Stacy, but was unsuccessful. On November 1, 1781, the General Assembly of Massachusetts passed a Resolve urging Governor John Hancock to encourage General Heath to pursue a prisoner exchange for Stacy.|$|E
