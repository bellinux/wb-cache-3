40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>fly</b> ash on the consistency, compactness, acidic properties, and strength of organic soil. The presence of organic content in the soil has detrimental impacts on the physical and strength behavior of soil. To investigate the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>fly</b> ash in the stabilization of organic soil, two types <b>of</b> <b>fly</b> ashes (Type I and Type II) at different percentages were used. It is found that fly ash significantly reduces the plasticity index of the organic soil, whereas the liquid and plastic limits increase. The dry density <b>of</b> the <b>fly</b> ash-soil mixture increases significantly, while the water requirement reduces due to the addition <b>of</b> <b>fly</b> ash. The increase of dry density compromises higher strength. The increase of qu with the increase <b>of</b> <b>fly</b> ash content is mainly due to the pozzolanic reaction <b>of</b> <b>fly</b> ash, although the reduction in water content results from the addition <b>of</b> dry <b>fly</b> ash solid. Moreover, Type I fly ash contributes a higher value of qu compared to Type II fly ash. This is attributed to the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>fly</b> ash including CaO and CaO/SiO 2 ratio...|$|R

5|$|Maggots {{found on}} corpses are useful to {{forensic}} entomologists. Maggot species {{can be identified}} by their anatomical features and by matching their DNA. Maggots of different species <b>of</b> <b>flies</b> visit corpses and carcases at fairly well-defined times {{after the death of}} the victim, and so do their predators, such as beetles in the family Histeridae. Thus, {{the presence or absence of}} particular species provides evidence for the time since death, and sometimes other details such as the place of death, when species are confined to particular habitats such as woodland.|$|E
5|$|Paxillus involutus can {{be found}} growing on lawns and old meadows {{throughout}} its distribution. Fruit bodies are generally terrestrial, {{though they may be}} found on woody material around tree stumps. They generally appear in autumn and late summer. In California, David Arora discerned a larger form associated with oak and pine which appears in late autumn and winter, as well as the typical form that is associated with birch plantings and appears in autumn. Several species <b>of</b> <b>flies</b> and beetles have been recorded using the fruit bodies to rear their young. The mushroom can be infected by Hypomyces chrysospermus, or bolete eater, a mould species that parasitises Boletales members. Infection results in the appearance of a whitish powder that first manifests on the pores, then spreads over the surface of the mushroom, becoming golden yellow to reddish-brown in maturity.|$|E

5|$|The {{species are}} native to meadows and woods in {{southern}} Europe and North Africa with {{a center of}} diversity in the Western Mediterranean, particularly the Iberian peninsula. Both wild and cultivated plants have naturalised widely, and were introduced into the Far East prior to the tenth century. Narcissi tend to be long-lived bulbs, which propagate by division, but are also insect-pollinated. Known pests, diseases and disorders include viruses, fungi, the larvae <b>of</b> <b>flies,</b> mites and nematodes. Some Narcissus species have become extinct, while others are threatened by increasing urbanisation and tourism.|$|E
5|$|Alice in Chains rose to {{international}} fame {{as part of}} the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. The band {{was one of the most}} successful music acts of the 1990s, selling over 20 million records worldwide, and over 14 million records in the US alone. Their debut album, Facelift, was released in 1990 and has been certified double-platinum by the RIAA, selling over two million copies. In 1992, the band's second album, Dirt, was released to critical acclaim and was certified quadruple platinum. Their second acoustic EP, Jar <b>of</b> <b>Flies,</b> debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart in 1994, becoming the first ever EP and first Alice in Chains release to top the charts, and it has been certified triple platinum by the RIAA. The band's third album, Alice in Chains, was released in 1995 and has been certified double platinum. It achieved No. 1 position on the Billboard 200 chart. The band has had 16 top ten songs on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and nine Grammy Award nominations.|$|E
5|$|Although Calvatia craniiformis is {{generally}} considered a saprobic species, in controlled laboratory conditions, an ectomycorrhizae between the fungus and American sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) was reported in a 1966 publication. A Chinese study showed that C.craniifromis would readily form mycorrhiza with poplar seedlings on unsterilized, but not on sterilized soil. Later research was unable to establish any similar association between C.craniiformis and Pinus ponderosa. Brain puffballs grow singly or in groups in fields and open woods, hardwood forests, and wet areas. In Asia, it has been recorded from China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, and South Korea. The brain puffball has been recorded from Australia. In North America, its range includes the eastern and southern United States, and Mexico. In Michigan, {{it is one of}} the few macrofungi found regularly in black locust plantations. Fruit bodies serve as a food source for several species <b>of</b> <b>flies.</b>|$|E
40|$|Thermal power {{stations}} that use pulverized coal as fuel generate large quantities <b>of</b> <b>fly</b> ash, resulting in environmental and disposal problems. Increasing demand for power {{leads to a}} greater use of coal and hence a further increase in the quantity <b>of</b> <b>fly</b> ash. These problems can be solved if the fly ash is put to use in an environmentally friendly way. Among the various uses for fly ash, the most massive and effective use is in geotechnical engineering applications. The study <b>of</b> <b>fly</b> ash and its interaction with soil is a must towards this goal. In the present investigation, an attempt {{has been made to}} study the engineering properties <b>of</b> <b>fly</b> ash—black cotton (BC) soil mixes with special reference to their use as sub-base materials in pavement construction.

5|$|Diptera {{have one}} pair of fore wings on the {{mesothorax}} {{and a pair of}} halteres, or reduced hind wings, on the metathorax. A further adaptation for flight is the reduction in number of the neural ganglia, and concentration of nerve tissue in the thorax, a feature that is most extreme in the highly derived Muscomorpha infraorder. Some species <b>of</b> <b>flies</b> are exceptional in that they are secondarily flightless. The only other order of insects bearing a single pair of true, functional wings, in addition to any form of halteres, are the Strepsiptera. In contrast to the flies, the Strepsiptera bear their halteres on the mesothorax and their flight wings on the metathorax. Each of the fly's six legs has a typical insect structure of coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and tarsus, with the tarsus in most instances being subdivided into five tarsomeres. At the tip of the limb is a pair of claws, and between these are cushion-like structures known as pulvilli which provide adhesion.|$|E
5|$|Flies are {{eaten by}} other animals at {{all stages of}} their development. The eggs and larvae are {{parasitised}} by other insects and are eaten by many creatures, some of which specialise in feeding on flies but most of which consume {{them as part of}} a mixed diet. Birds, bats, frogs, lizards, dragonflies and spiders are among the predators <b>of</b> <b>flies.</b> Many flies have evolved mimetic resemblances that aid their protection. Batesian mimicry is widespread with many hoverflies resembling bees and wasps, ants and some species of tephritid fruit fly resembling spiders. Some species of hoverfly are myrmecophilous, their young live and grow within the nests of ants. They are protected from the ants by imitating chemical odours given by ant colony members. Bombyliid bee flies such as Bombylius major are short-bodied, round, furry, and distinctly bee-like as they visit flowers for nectar, and are likely also Batesian mimics of bees.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} initially {{consisted of}} only ten families and met in several temporary locations {{before moving to}} a permanent building. These locations included a house on 24th Avenue and 9th Street, a room above Carney's Grocery Store, and Sheehan Hall. In this interim period, the congregation grew to include 50 members by 1878, with David Burgheim serving as rabbi. The Middle Eastern style building {{at the corner of}} 8th Street and 22nd Avenue, constructed by the growing congregation in 1879, was the first building in the city with gas-powered lighting. Rabbi Burgheim was succeeded by Rabbi W. Weinstein, then Rabbi Jacobs, and then Rabbi Judah Wechsler. Wechsler, who became rabbi in 1887, led a movement to provide public schools for blacks, which culminated in a bond issue to construct the first brick public school building for African Americans in the state. The Wechsler School was named after him and has since been listed on the National Register of Historic Places and as a Mississippi Landmark. The congregation stayed in this building for several years, before eventually being forced to move due to complaints <b>of</b> <b>flies</b> attracted by horse droppings outside of a nearby retail store.|$|E
