5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are capable}} of killing humans. Mistaken identity leading to an attack is always possible, especially in or near cloudy waters. American alligators are <b>often</b> <b>less</b> aggressive towards humans than larger crocodile species, a few of which (mainly the Nile and Saltwater crocodiles) may prey on humans with some regularity. American alligator bites are serious injuries due to the reptile's sheer bite force and risk of infection. Even with medical treatment, an American alligator bite may still result in a fatal infection.|$|E
5|$|In public statements, Young {{claimed the}} {{alphabet}} {{was intended to}} replace the traditional Latin alphabet with an alternative, more phonetically accurate alphabet for the English language. This would offer immigrants {{an opportunity to learn}} to read and write English, he said, the orthography of which is <b>often</b> <b>less</b> phonetically consistent than those of many other languages. Similar experiments have not been uncommon, the most well-known of which is the Shavian alphabet.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{metabolites}} {{are often}} characterized as either qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative metabolites {{are defined as}} toxins that interfere with an herbivore’s metabolism, often by blocking specific biochemical reactions. Qualitative chemicals are present in plants in relatively low concentrations (<b>often</b> <b>less</b> than 2% dry weight), and are not dosage dependent. They are usually small, water-soluble molecules, and therefore can be rapidly synthesized, transported and stored with relatively little energy cost to the plant. Qualitative allelochemicals are usually effective against non-adapted specialists and generalist herbivores.|$|E

5|$|Some {{academic}} researchers {{argue that}} the actual efficacy of SJS is obscured by poor research methodology. Specifically, demographic characteristics used to predict juror attitudes and juror verdicts may not hold true across all kinds of cases. For example, men convict more frequently than women in some types of criminal trials but less frequently in others. Besides this, demographic characteristics are <b>often</b> <b>less</b> predictive than the attitudes jurors hold; for example, attitudes towards rape are better verdict-predictors than gender in rape trials.|$|E
5|$|There is {{polyadenylation}} in the cytosol of some {{animal cell}} types, namely in the germ line, during early embryogenesis and in post-synaptic sites of nerve cells. This lengthens the poly(A) tail of an mRNA with a shortened poly(A) tail, {{so that the}} mRNA will be translated. These shortened poly(A) tails are <b>often</b> <b>less</b> than 20 nucleotides, and are lengthened to around 80–150 nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|Arrangers called gamemasters (GMs) {{determine}} {{the rules and}} setting of a LARP, and may also influence an event and act as referees while it is taking place. The GMs may also do the logistical work, or {{there may be other}} arrangers who handle details such as advertising the event, booking a venue, and financial management. Unlike the GM in a tabletop role-playing game, a LARP GM seldom has an overview of everything that is happening during play because numerous participants may be interacting at once. For this reason, a LARP GM's role is <b>often</b> <b>less</b> concerned with tightly maintaining a narrative or directly entertaining the players, and more with arranging the structure of the LARP before play begins and facilitating the players and crew to maintain the fictional environment during play.|$|E
5000|$|A {{contemporary}} {{alternative to}} the traditional, liquid-filled bain-marie is the electric [...] "dry-heat" [...] bain-marie, heated by elements below both pots. The dry-heat form of electric bains-marie <b>often</b> consumes <b>less</b> energy, requires little cleaning, and can be heated more quickly than traditional versions. They can also operate at higher temperatures, and are <b>often</b> much <b>less</b> expensive than their traditional counterparts.|$|R

50|$|Marshall Brown (1920-1983) was a jazz {{musician}} and educator. He played trombones and, <b>less</b> <b>often,</b> bass trumpet or euphonium, and even <b>less</b> <b>often</b> electric bass & banjo. He played the valve trombone.|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} of Bouchard's arrival to the Montreal Canadiens the club had not won the {{championship}} for 10 years and attendance at the Forum was very low, <b>often</b> <b>less</b> than 3,000 a game, and {{there was talk of}} folding the franchise. A few years earlier, in 1935, Canadien owners had seriously considered an offer to sell the team to be moved to Cleveland. After finishing last or {{near the bottom of the}} league for several years, apathy of the fans was matched by the players themselves who had accepted losing as way of hockey life. In his first training camp, he showcased his physical play by body-checking players, including veterans, with abandon. When the season started other teams discovered that with Bouchard in the lineup they could no longer push Canadien players around. Bouchard's presence reinvigorated the Canadiens and he is credited with playing an important part in keeping the franchise from leaving Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Richard Coeur de Lion is a Grade II listed equestrian {{statue of}} the 12th-century English monarch Richard I, also known as Richard the Lionheart, who reigned from 1189–99. It stands on a granite {{pedestal}} in Old Palace Yard outside the Palace of Westminster, facing south towards {{the entrance to the}} House of Lords. It was created by Baron Carlo Marochetti, an Italian sculptor whose works were popular with European royalty and the nobility, though <b>often</b> <b>less</b> well regarded by critics and the artistic establishment. The statue was first produced in clay and displayed at The Great Exhibition in 1851, where it was located outside the west entrance to the Crystal Palace. It was well received at the time and two years later Queen Victoria and Prince Albert headed a list of illustrious subscribers to a fund that aimed {{to raise money for the}} casting of the statue in bronze.|$|E
5|$|Several causes {{provoked}} a dramatic population decrease over time: on one hand, commercial hunting (especially during the Roman Empire and Middle Ages) and, during the 20th century, eradication by fishermen, {{who used to}} consider it a pest due to the damage the seal causes to fishing nets when it preys on fish caught in them; and, on the other hand, coastal urbanization and pollution. Currently, its entire population {{is estimated to be}} less than 600 individuals scattered throughout a wide distribution range, which qualifies this species as endangered. Its current very sparse population is one more serious threat to the species, as it only has two key sites that can be deemed viable. One is the Aegean Sea (250–300 animals in Greece, with the largest concentration of animals in Gyaros island, and some 100 in Turkey); the other important subpopulation is the Western Saharan portion of Cabo Blanco (around 200 individuals which may support the small, but growing, nucleus in the Desertas Islands – approximately 20 individuals). There may be some individuals using coastal areas among other parts of Western Sahara, such as in Cintra Bay. These two key sites are virtually in the extreme opposites of the species' distribution range, which makes natural population interchange between them impossible. All the other remaining subpopulations are composed of less than 50 mature individuals, many of them being only loose groups of extremely reduced size – <b>often</b> <b>less</b> than five individuals. Consequently, there is low genetic variability.|$|E

25|$|The {{vertebral}} column consists of anywhere between 200 and 400 (or more) vertebrae. Tail vertebrae are comparatively {{few in number}} (<b>often</b> <b>less</b> than 20% of the total) and lack ribs, while body vertebrae each have two ribs articulating with them. The vertebrae have projections that allow for strong muscle attachment enabling locomotion without limbs.|$|E
25|$|Speed {{cushions}} are <b>often</b> <b>less</b> {{costly than}} speed humps or tables, and most cities report {{them to be}} just as effective. In some jurisdictions, narrower speed cushions are placed at more frequent intervals to allow ambulances to pass while driving over the centre line. Large trucks (e.g. UPS, FedEx) are also not slowed down.|$|E
5000|$|If one brings one's own firearms, ear and eye protection, it {{is often}} {{possible}} to buy a 50-round box of 9 mm ammunition and target, rent an indoor lane for an hour, and enjoy shooting for under $50 in the United States. Fees for outdoor ranges are <b>often</b> even <b>less,</b> <b>often</b> running $6.50 for 3 hours of range time. Along with a 500-round brick of [...]22 LR ammunition that <b>often</b> costs <b>less</b> than $60.00, it is possible on an outdoor range to enjoy an afternoon of shooting for under $70. Firearm rental fees vary, depending on the model and caliber, but for a typical, non-exotic handgun, costs are only modestly higher. Hearing and eye protection rental fees are modest, often available for under $3 each.|$|R
