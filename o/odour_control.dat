The sludge pipeline was used to transfer sludge to Shell Green, near Widnes, where it is turned into ash, or used in agriculture. Parts of the old secondary beds became the Davyhulme Millennium Nature Reserve in 2000, and low-profile geodesic domes were built over the primary settlement tanks in 2003, {{as part of a}} £20 million <b>odour</b> <b>control</b> scheme. The works continues to be innovative. In 2013, the world's largest thermal hydrolysis plant was commissioned. Sludge is heated to 165 degrees Celsius under pressure, and the pressure is then released in a flash tank. This process breaks up complex organic substances, allowing it to be digested more easily. Large volumes of methane are a by-product, which enables the site to be self-sufficient for gas and electricity. A £200 million upgrade to the second Activated Sludge Plant began in 2014, and is expected to be completed in 2018. The works now handles sewage for a population of 1.2 million people, most of which is water.

40|$|Resumen del póster presentado a la 10 th European Vertebrate Pest Management Conference, celebrada en Sevilla (España) del 21 al 25 de septiembre de 2015. Chemical {{signals are}} the main {{communication}} channel in small mammals and are implied in many aspects of their behaviour. Thus, conspecific odours could {{have the potential to}} attract individuals to massive trapping systems. This is a control method that is increasingly used in invertebrate plague control but that remains mainly unexplored for rodents. Through scent marking, individuals obtain information about the presence of conspecifics in a given area, and this is the main mechanism of intrasexual competence in mammals. We have experimentally examined chemosensory behaviour of male and female common voles in response to scent-marks of other males or females during the main breeding season. Individual voles were introduced 5 min in a Y-maze with conspecific odour in one of the arms and <b>control</b> <b>odour</b> in the other. Their behaviour was recorded by video-camera and the overall time spent on each arm calculated. Experimental males spent similar time in areas marked with conspecific male <b>odour</b> or <b>control</b> <b>odour,</b> what do not suggest any preference or avoidance of areas used by other males. However, males spent significantly more time in the arm marked with female odour as compared with a <b>control</b> <b>odour.</b> In the case of females, they always spent more time in the arm marked with conspecific odour, either of males or females, than in the <b>control</b> <b>odour.</b> These results suggest that attracting females to traps with conspecific scent could potentially be a more profitable strategy than attracting males.

The SHFT has carried out extensive works on site, remediation of the ground contamination and buildings. The first stage of the remediation project included above ground works, demolition of a three storey building at the north of the site and part of the wharf, removal of hazardous materials, repairs to the seawall and remaining wharf. A large <b>odour</b> <b>control</b> enclosure, an emission control system and water treatment plant were constructed for the remediation works. Around 3,000 tonnes of tar-containing materials were excavated and removed by barge for off-site disposal. An additional 27,000 tonnes of material remained for on-site treatment and stabilisation. This remaining material was then used to backfill the excavated area and to create a mound capped with clean soil, forming the base for a future public park at the northern end of the site.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been new odour {{assessment}} tools available to help municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) understand their off-site odour impact, such as dispersion modelling, portable odour measurement panel equipment, electronic noses, air tracer compounds, and odour sensors {{that can be used}} to measure ambient odours at the plant fenceline. However, perception of odours is highly subjective, individuals might have different responses to an odour at various concentration and duration. Many WWTPs have serious concerns about off-site odour impacts that are causing them to look for viable <b>odour</b> <b>controls</b> to meet community needs for an odour-free environment. This paper presents ways to demonstrate compliance with community odour standards using dispersion modelling, direct fenceline ambient sampling, and portable odour measurement equipment. Hand-held ambient odour and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) measurement devices were evaluated, and they compared favorably to odour dispersion modelling results for a mid-sized WWTP in the United States. Other methods, such as the electronic nose, were reviewed but not included in this paper because they are better suited for sampling at the odour emission source than for ambient sampling. Electronic noses also tend to have high detection limits for known odourous compounds emitted at a WWTP, which means that the typical WWTP odourous emission concentrations emitted may not be detected by the device. This paper provides insight into ambient sampling approaches using hand-held devices instead of other methods or approaches, including dispersion modelling and/or direct emissions source testing, to determine a WWTP’s off-site odour impacts. Results from this innovative approach, which relies on recent innovations in portable, odour measurement panel equipment, show that a simple strategy exists to prioritize <b>odour</b> sources for <b>controls.</b> The dispersion model results in the case study, using source-measured inputs, were verified at the fenceline using data gathered with hand-held ambient odour measurement and metering devices. 1...|$|R

5000|$|The main {{advantage}} of lamella clarifiers over other clarifying systems {{is the large}} effective settling area caused {{by the use of}} inclined plates, which improves the operating conditions of the clarifiers in a number of ways. The unit is more compact usually requiring only 65-80 % of the area of clarifiers operating without inclined plates. [...] Therefore, where site footprint constraints are of concern a lamella clarifier system is preferred. The reduced required area allows the possibility for the clarifiers to be located and operated inside, reducing some of the common problems of algae growth, clogging due to blowing debris accumulation and <b>odour</b> <b>control,</b> that occur when the machinery is outdoors. Operation within an enclosed space also allows for a better control of operating temperature and pressure conditions. The inclined plates mean the clarifier can operate with overflow rates 2 to 4 times that of traditional clarifiers which allow a greater influent flow rate and thus a more time efficient clarification process. Lamella clarifiers also offer a simple design without requiring the use of chemicals. They are therefore able to act as pre-treatment for delicate membrane processes. Where necessary flocculants may be added to promote efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In the rat's {{olfactory}} bulb, the {{mitral cell}} multiunit activity {{in response to}} food odour changes with the internal states of food deprivation or satiety. It is demonstrated that stomach disten-sion {{should be one of}} the factors acting on the centrifugal control of the olfactory input. An inflatable balloon was chronically inserted into the stomach of male rats trained to eat a single daily meal. The mitral cell responses to the usual food odour and to the <b>control</b> <b>odour</b> of isoamyl acetate were recorded in unanaesthetized fasted animals for 3 successive states of the stomach: empty, then inflated by introducing water into the balloon, and empty again. Stomach inflation produced a rapid, long last-ing and significant decrease of the bulb responsiveness to food odour without changing the responsive-ness to <b>control</b> <b>odour.</b> Stomach distension thus simulates the previously noticed effects of satiety on the selective modulation of the olfactory input. 1...|$|R

We examined a wild population of western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) to test the efficacy of predator faecal odour in influencing time allocated to different behaviours and inducing changes in habitat use. Kangaroos were exposed to fresh faeces of a historical predator, the dingo (Canis lupus dingo), a recently introduced predator, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), a herbivore (horse, Equus caballus) and an unscented control simultaneously. Kangaroos did not increase vigilance in predator-scented areas. However, they investigated odour sources by approaching and sniffing; more time was spent investigating fox <b>odour</b> than <b>control</b> <b>odours.</b> Kangaroos then exhibited a clear anti-predator response to predator odours, modifying their space use by rapidly escaping, then avoiding fox and dingo odour sources. Our results demonstrate that wild western grey kangaroos show behavioural responses to predator faeces, investigating then avoiding these olfactory cues of potential predation risk, rather than increasing general vigilance. This study contributes {{to our understanding of}} the impact of introduced mammalian predators on marsupial prey and demonstrates that a native Australian marsupial can recognize and respond to the odour of potential predators, including one that has been recently introduced. 7 page(s...|$|R

There is an obvious advantage for prey species to detect the presence of predators in their environment, enabling them {{to make decisions about}} movement and foraging behavior based on perceived risk of predation. One technique commonly exploited to assess this risk is to use the odours of the faeces and/or urine of their predators to determine presence/absence and the length of time since a predator passed through an area. I examined the effect of faecal odours from marsupial and eutherian predators, and a native reptilian predator, on the behavior of three endemic Australian rodent species (the Fawn-footed Melomys Melomys cervinipes, the Bush Rat Rattus fuscipes and the Giant White-tailed Rat Uromys caudimaculatus) in rainforest remnants on the Atherton Tableland, North Queensland, Australia. Infrared camera traps were used to assess visit rates of rodents to odour stations containing faecal and <b>control</b> <b>odours.</b> Rodents avoided odour stations containing predator faeces, but did not avoid herbivore or <b>control</b> <b>odours.</b> The responses of the three prey species differed: in the late wet season U. caudimaculatus avoided predator odours, while R. fuscipes and M. cervinipes did not.

In this study, we compared behavioural and electrophysiological responses of reproductive and non-reproductive female round gobies to conspe-cific males. Results of behavioural experiments in the laboratory showed that RF spent significantly more time near the source of the male odour compared with <b>odours</b> from <b>control</b> water.

However, the EOG responses of RF were about eight-fold higher than non-RF exposed to RM odours. These findings confirm that RM round gobies release a pheromone signal that attracts RF.
