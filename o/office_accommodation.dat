5|$|The {{surrounding}} area is partly residential, and includes the major St Mary's Hospital, restaurants and hotels. Until recently {{there was little}} <b>office</b> <b>accommodation</b> in the area, and most commuters interchanged between National Rail and the London Underground to reach workplaces in the West End or the City. However, recent redevelopment of derelict railway and canal land, marketed as Paddington Waterside, has resulted in new office complexes nearby.|$|E

5|$|Gray's Inn and {{the other}} three Inns of Court remain the only bodies legally allowed to call a {{barrister}} to the Bar, allowing him or her to practise in England and Wales. Although the Inn was previously a disciplinary and teaching body, these functions are now shared between the four Inns, with the Bar Standards Board (a division of the General Council of the Bar) acting as a disciplinary body and the Inns of Court and Bar Educational Trust providing education. The Inn remains a collegiate self-governing, unincorporated association of its members, providing within its precincts library, dining, residential and <b>office</b> <b>accommodation</b> (chambers), along with a chapel. Members of the Bar from other Inns may use these facilities to some extent.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} a house of rest for the monks of St Augustine's Abbey, which became Bristol Cathedral. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries it was granted to Sir George Norton who built an Elizabethan mansion. One of his {{descendants}} gave sanctuary to Charles II during his escape to France in 1651. The original house was demolished and rebuilt in the Regency period by Philip John Miles and became {{the seat of the}} Miles baronets. The mansion housed a collection of over a hundred paintings representing many Old Masters. In 1917 it was sold to Dr Harold Nelson Burden, for use as a hospital for the mentally challenged which continued until the 1980s. The estate now offers <b>office</b> <b>accommodation,</b> conference and meeting rooms, and the house has a licence as a venue for civil wedding services.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{remained the}} headquarters of Cunard until the 1960s, {{when they decided to}} relocate their UK operations to Southampton on England's south coast and their global headquarters to New York. Cunard subsequently sold the building to Prudential plc in 1969. In 1965 the Cunard Building was awarded Grade II* listed building status by the English Heritage. Initially, it was listed together with the Liver Building and Port of Liverpool Building under Pier Head, but in 1985 each building gained its own listing. In November 2001 the building was sold to the Merseyside Pension Fund, an organisation that provides pension services to public sector workers in Merseyside. Today, the building provides a range of <b>office</b> <b>accommodation</b> for a variety of public and private sector organisations, including Government Office North West. In November 2008 it was announced that the building managers had appointed the local architects firm Buttress Fuller Alsop Williams to draw up a conservation plan to preserve the building. The plan involved collaboration with English Heritage and the Local Authority Conservation Officer and would be used to control any modification and repairs made to the building.|$|E

25|$|When {{the station}} opened, its narrow {{frontage}} {{was in a}} row of shops, but the buildings to the south of the station were demolished in the 1960s to enable the flyover to be built, leaving the station as one of two isolated buildings.

30|$|However, {{one must}} {{keep in mind}} that group-specific {{treatment}} may be necessary to correct patterns of discrimination and injustices that hinder the equal status of minority groups, which is, again, one of the preconditions of the contact hypothesis. Immigrant minorities are vulnerable to specific patterns of exclusion and discrimination that require group specific measures (language acquisition, diploma recognition, anti-racism, ensuring the visibility of minorities in the medias and public <b>offices,</b> <b>accommodation</b> in public institutions, etc.). This implies that mainstreaming cannot be a fundamental overarching principle that rule out all specific treatment targeting immigrant groups.|$|R

With {{the completion of the}} 75 m high concrete tower in 1967 the complex was formally transferred to the Luftwaffe's Communication Sector C (Fernmeldesektor C). The tower, the heart of the complex, had sixteen floors and a floor area of 750 m2 as well as antenna mountings, intelligence-gathering rooms and service rooms, but also <b>offices,</b> <b>accommodation</b> and a mess. The tower was linked to other buildings and an underground nuclear bomb shelter with alternate command post by a tunnel, which prevented observation as well as icing.|$|R
25|$|The company outgrew its {{suburban}} home in 1995 {{and moved to}} CBD <b>office</b> <b>accommodation</b> yet its early growth during the Internet boom was hampered by the ability of Telstra (not releasing Bigpond as an ISP until 1997) {{to cope with the}} demand of needed telephone lines, and by the sheer competitive pressure in the Perth market, which had a comparative oversupply of low-cost providers. In 1996, iiNet successfully expanded into the Adelaide market under the name light.iinet.net.au (named after Colonel Light), in partnership with locals John Lindsay and Leigh Hart. The SA arm moved quickly to become the number three ISP in the state, before being acquired by Auslink in 1998.|$|E

25|$|The {{historic}} medieval Bishop's Palace lies {{immediately to}} the south of the cathedral in Palace Yard; managed by English Heritage, it is open to visitors.

It is now known as Edward King House and provides offices for the bishops, archdeacons and diocesan staff. A 14-bedroom house (Bishop's House) on Eastgate was the official residence in use from 1948 until 2011, when the bishop's office staff and home were separated, allowing the incoming bishop, Christopher Lowson, to live in a modern five-bedroom house.|$|E
