25|$|David {{gathered}} {{together all the}} chosen men of Israel — 30,000 in all — and went to retrieve the Ark of the Covenant from Baale-judah. They brought the Ark {{out of the house}} of Abinadab and set it on a new cart. Abinadab's sons Uzzah and Ahio drove the cart, with Ahio going before the Ark. David and the Israelites played with all manner of instruments — harps, psalteries, timbrels, sistra, and cymbals. When they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah put <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> the Ark. In anger, God smote Uzzah for his error, and Uzzah died by the Ark.|$|E
500|$|Fifteen {{years after}} the rescue, the USAF held a {{symposium}} at Nellis AFB and invited all those directly involved. John Van Etten, whose call sign was Nail 32, had never met Gene Hambleton in person. When he stepped on stage and put <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> Gene, he said, [...] "Hello, Gene, I'm John Van Etten," [...] and Gene replied, [...] "No, you're not....you are Nail 32, I would recognize that voice anywhere!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Bat Masterson {{died at age}} 67 on October 25, 1921, at {{his desk}} from a massive heart attack after writing what became his final column for the New York Morning Telegraph. [...] About 500 people {{attended}} Bat Masterson's funeral service at Frank E. Campbell's Funeral Church at Broadway and 66th Street. [...] Masterson's honorary pall bearers included Damon Runyon (1880–1946), George [...] "Tex" [...] Rickard (1870–1929), and William Eugene Lewis (1861–1924). Runyon was [...] {{a close friend of}} Masterson's and offered this memorable eulogy: [...] "He was a 100 percent, 22-karat real man. Bat was a good hater and a wonderful friend. He was always stretching <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> some down-and-outer. He had {{a great sense of humor}} and a marvelous fund of reminiscence, and was one of the most entertaining companions we have ever known. There are only too few men in the world like Bat Masterson and his death is a genuine loss." [...] Masterson was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx. [...] His full name, William Barclay Masterson, appears above his epitaph on the large granite grave marker in Woodlawn. Masterson's epitaph states that he was [...] "Loved by Everyone".|$|E
60|$|Roger went {{straight}} out to Lowlands. He found Freda in the snuggery and held <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|... "My Polly always {{brings the}} {{sunshine}} with her," [...] and Mr. Shaw held <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> little friend, {{for she was}} his favorite still.|$|R
60|$|Vainly he put <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> stay <b>his</b> progress, vainly {{he tried}} by every means {{in his power}} to obtain some sort of hold on the rocks.|$|R
2500|$|After {{receiving}} the submission {{of the inhabitants}} of Memphis and {{of the rest of}} the Egyptian people, some submitting voluntarily, others under threats, [...] marched by easy stages towards Alexandria. After crossing the river at Eleusis, about four miles from Alexandria, he was met by the Roman commissioners, to whom he gave a friendly greeting and held <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> Popilius. Popilius, however, placed in his hand the tablets on which was written the decree of the senate and told him first of all to read it. After reading it through, he said he would call his friends into council and consider what he ought to do. Popilius, stern and imperious as ever, drew a circle round the king with the stick he was carrying and said, [...] "Before you step out of that circle give me a reply to lay before the senate." [...] For a few moments he hesitated, astounded at such a peremptory order, and at last replied, [...] "I will do what the senate thinks right." [...] Not till then did Popilius extend his hand to the king as to a friend and ally. Antiochus evacuated Egypt at the appointed date, and the commissioners exerted their authority to establish a lasting concord between the brothers, as they had as yet hardly made peace with each other.

2500|$|In the 1940s, a {{man known}} as [...] "Big Spear Liu" [...] came to Shanghai's [...] "big world," [...] the city's major {{performance}} and entertainment centre. Liu asked the doorkeeper, [...] "Are there any good hands around here?", {{looking for a}} skilled opponent to challenge. The doorkeeper told [...] "Big Spear Liu" [...] of Tian Zhaolin (student of Yang Jianhou). [...] With that Liu set off to find him. He found Tian Zhaolin and immediately demanded to spar by each striking the other three times, to which Tian Zhaolin responded {{that it may not}} be necessary. He said, [...] "Just let me touch you. If you can tolerate my touch, you win." [...] Liu, sensing a fool and an effortless victory, immediately agreed. The two men approached and Tian Zhaolin reached <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> touch Liu's chest. Within a few moments, Liu's facial muscles started to contort. Soon he grimaced and his face showed signs of intense pain. Spear Liu pulled away and, after recovering, commented, [...] "I have travelled throughout five provinces and various cities but until today I have never seen such a profound skill." [...] Energy, including that of taijiquan, may be thought of as transmission by wave. [...] Earlier generation adepts in taijiquan had an expression—"hitting the cow {{on this side of the}} Mountain." [...] This phrase referred to hitting an opponent's front side with the pain and effect being felt on the back side. [...] In years past, people who sparred with Yang Shaohou often described him as also having an energy like electricity. That is, it caused very painful sensations in the muscle and even on the skin surface. Tian Zhaolin, coming from that background, also knew this method.|$|E
60|$|Clennam, much affected, {{stretched}} <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> this honest spirit.|$|E
60|$|At last he put <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> seize mine, {{and drawing}} {{me to the}} light he scanned my face, Heaven alone knowing what it was he sought there.|$|R
60|$|She {{shoved him}} in {{in front of}} 'er and stood ever 'im while he climbed aboard. When he held <b>out</b> <b>'is</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> help 'er she struck it away.|$|R
60|$|He put <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> take her, but {{she turned}} perversely from him, and hid {{her face in}} Annie's neck, pushing <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> away with a {{backward}} reach of her little arm.|$|R
60|$|He held <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> take {{farewell}} in the Kablunet's fashion.|$|E

60|$|A great shout went up, and Nasmyth held <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> Laura.|$|E
60|$|The man {{bowed and}} silently withdrew. Not {{until he had}} left the room did Feurgéres move from his place. Then he arose to his feet and held <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> Isobel.|$|R
60|$|She {{was within}} a few steps of it, and Oz was holding <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> help her into the basket, when, crack! went the ropes, and the balloon rose into the air without her.|$|R
60|$|He departed, {{closing the}} door behind him. Francis held <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> Margaret. She rose slowly to her feet, looked in the glass helplessly and then back at him. She was very {{beautiful}} but a little dazed.|$|R
60|$|He held <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> Carnally, {{and they}} gripped in silence. Words were unnecessary.|$|E
60|$|Teddy reached <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> touch Neal; but {{the latter}} was not near him.|$|E

6000|$|He held <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> him, and entreaty was stamped upon Robespierre's countenance to {{a degree}} which perhaps no man had yet seen. [...] "Bethink you, cher Caron--" [...] he began again. But the young man shook his head.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I was her father! I was her father!’ {{cried the}} old man, {{stretching}} <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> the dark shadows flying on above. ‘Have mercy on her, and on me! Where does she go? Turn her back! I was her father!’ ...|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{approached}} the horse, and cautiously reached <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> unhook the chain from the ring at the horse's mouth, standing {{a good way}} back, and leaning forward on tiptoe, as if he thought the horse would bite him.|$|R
60|$|They {{reached the}} gate of the villa. He held <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> say good-by.|$|E
60|$|He was {{standing}} now by her side, {{and he held}} <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Sabin.|$|E

6000|$|... "Humph!

[...] "Did you see them Plover brothers?" ...|$|R
60|$|Falgate gasped--a {{helpless}} fool--while Mainwaring hurled himself {{forward to}} prevent the thing he saw impended. Too late. Even as he flung <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> grapple with <b>his</b> lordship, Rotherby's arm drove straight before him and sent his sword through the undefended back of Mr. Caryll.|$|R
6000|$|... "I go," [...] {{said the}} victim, rising and {{stretching}} <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> the guards, [...] "but may you also all be slain {{in the sight}} of the Romans, you mad murderers, who, in your lust for power, have brought doom and agony upon the people of the Jews." ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{new friend}} screwed his eyes up tighter and, muttering something, put <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|E
60|$|The {{man held}} <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> {{withdraw}} {{the cup of}} bouillon, but Quest drew it towards him.|$|E
60|$|Sinclair was hot tempered, but of {{a generous}} disposition, and he held <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> Oswald, frankly.|$|E
60|$|Summerlee {{nodded his}} {{reluctant}} acquiescence and held <b>out</b> <b>his</b> thin <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> Challenger.|$|R
6000|$|The {{sergeant}} {{strode to}} the table at which the lads were sitting, and, drawing a chair up, held <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> them.

6000|$|... 'Oh, don't,' began Nuttie, much gratified, but at {{that moment}} Miss Nugent came out at her door, and Mr. Spyers, who was some way in advance, looked round and waited for them to come up. He held <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> her and said, 'Well, Nuttie, my child, you are going to begin a new life.' ...|$|R
