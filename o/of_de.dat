Here, DE 9 turns east onto Delaware Street and is signed concurrent with DE 273, even though this portion of road is officially not DE 273. The road carries one eastbound lane and two westbound lanes. The route narrows back to two lanes and crosses the New Castle Industrial Track Trail before it heads across the Norfolk Southern line again, at which point it turns east-northeast onto Ferry Cut Off Street near the New Castle Historic District. The historic district {{is home to the}} New Castle Court House Museum, New Castle Green, and the Sherriff's House, which are all part of First State National Historical Park. The road passes homes and businesses before intersecting East 6th Street, where DE 273 signage ends.|$|E

Both places derive their name from the Des Moines River, which flows through the city <b>of</b> <b>Des</b> Moines and originally flowed through the county. When the county was divided early in Iowa's history, the river ended up further west, forming the border between Lee County, Iowa and the state of Missouri.|$|R
5|$|He {{received}} his wings {{in the summer}} of 1936. He met Jimmy Rawnsley at this time, a 32-year-old electrical engineer who would later serve as aerial gunner and radar operator on all but three of John's successful air battles. Cunningham subsequently became a junior test pilot with de Havilland, working with light aircraft alongside Geoffrey de Havilland, the company founder's son and chief test pilot. The company was short of test pilots and Cunningham caught the eye <b>of</b> <b>de</b> Havilland as his flight experience grew. It was reflected by his promotion to flying officer on 5 December 1937. At this time John began to care more for test-flying than manufacture and design. He became one of four <b>of</b> <b>de</b> Havilland's top test pilots.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, two {{publishers}} {{started a}} legal battle {{for the right to}} the names of the newspapers and magazines. Vandersteen, caught in the middle, worked a while for both, but eventually switched to the new owners <b>of</b> <b>De</b> Standaard. He continued to work for Ons Volkske, which was now renamed 't Kapoentje for a few more months. The publishers <b>of</b> <b>De</b> Standaard also continued the album series of Suske en Wiske, which started modestly with one album in 1946 and one in 1947. By 1947, seven albums were available, and the first ones were already reprinted. The first albums <b>of</b> <b>De</b> Familie Snoek had also appeared by then. Supported by large publicity campaigns, they sold very well: the first Snoek album was in its third impression by 1948.

5|$|According to Di Carlo, {{the remains}} <b>of</b> <b>De</b> Mauro were buried under a {{bridge over the}} Oreto river near Palermo. However, the police, after a search, did not find the body.

According to the new testimony of the pentito Naimo, De Mauro {{was taken to a}} terrain in Pallavicino neighbourhood in Palermo where the Mafia boss Francesco Madonia owned a chicken farm. He was killed there and dumped in a pit.|$|E
5|$|After de l'Orme died in 1570, Catherine {{abandoned}} his {{design for a}} freestanding house with courtyards. To his unfinished wing she added a pavilion that extended the building towards the river. This was built in a less experimental style by Jean Bullant. Bullant attached columns to his pavilion, as advocated in his 1564 book on the classical orders, to mark proportion. Some commentators have interpreted his different approach as a criticism <b>of</b> <b>de</b> l'Orme's departures from the style of Roman monuments.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, {{selection}} can {{be divided}} according to its effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative selection acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed by de novo mutation, which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, {{even in the absence}} <b>of</b> <b>de</b> novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.|$|E

The DeMorgan tablet was removed and replaced with a Royal Doulton tablet giving the correct location and date.

5|$|By 1920, {{what would}} {{originally}} become DE 404 was an unimproved county road, with the section east of Bridgeville under contract {{as a state}} highway. The entire route of what would become DE 404 was completed as a state highway to a point northwest of Bridgeville by 1924. By 1931, the road was built as a state highway northwest to the Maryland border. DE 404 was designated to run from the Maryland border, where it connected to MD 404, southeast to DE 18 southeast of Bridgeville by 1936. The route followed its current alignment to Bridgeville, where it passed through the town on Market Street and South Main Street before picking up its current alignment east of US 13. At this time, what is now DE 404 past its then-eastern terminus was designated as part <b>of</b> <b>DE</b> 18. By 1987, DE 404 was extended east to DE 1 in Five Points, following DE 18 to Georgetown and US 9 (which had replaced a portion <b>of</b> <b>DE</b> 18) from Georgetown to Five Points. DE 404 Alt. was created to bypass Bridgeville {{to the north and}} east by 1990, following Newton Road and US 13.
