5|$|When David's first book, Mediterranean Food was {{published}} in 1950 the British public was still enduring food rationing after the Second World War.

5|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} that oral traditions in general and poetry in particular was well placed to {{play a part in}} cultural resistance to apartheid. Music and poetry were more accessible to a large number of South Africans than written material (partly due to the restrictions placed by apartheid). Music, poetry, and storytelling also formed part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>everyday</b> life of a number of South Africans, and protest songs emerged from these traditions. In addition, poetry was traditionally seen by some South Africans as a legitimate means of criticising authority, with poetic licence allowing artists to say things that would otherwise not be acceptable.|$|E

25|$|The most general {{interpretation}} of entropy is {{as a measure}} of our uncertainty about a system.

25|$|Though Cabell is {{best known}} as a fantasist, the plots and {{characters}} of his first few novels, The Eagle's Shadow (1904), The Cords of Vanity (1909), and The Rivet in Grandfather's Neck (1915) (later all adapted for inclusion into the Biography), do not wander out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>everyday</b> society of Virginia's beleaguered gentry. But Cabell's signature droll style is clearly in evidence, and in later printings each book would bear a characteristically Cabellian subtitle: A Comedy of Purse-Strings, A Comedy of Shirking, and A Comedy of Limitations, respectively.|$|E
25|$|While in exile, Becket {{engaged in}} letter writing, writing to many English noblemen and bishops.

Becket continued to attempt to resolve the dispute, but Alexander ordered the archbishop to refrain from provoking the king before spring 1166. Meanwhile, Henry had delegated much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>everyday</b> business of the English Church to Foliot, who although supportive of the king was no compliant supplicant, and was known as a supporter of papal positions. Neither Foliot nor Henry had any great desire to settle with Becket quickly.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} and organisation {{of amateur}} networks of observation in Britain {{in the period}} between 1920 and 1940 are addressed in this paper. It examines the geographical, organisational and epistemological associations between networks of ornithological observation (traced through the British Trust for Ornithology), which emerged from the 1920 s, and amateur ethnography (traced through Mass-Observation) which emerged in the late 1930 s. I approach these ‘observational cultures’ as spaces which brought together new concepts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local, <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> nature and society, as well as <b>the</b> possibilities <b>of</b> changing <b>the</b> <b>everyday.</b> <b>The</b> paper suggests that popular observation during the period partly constituted a reframing of ways of knowing Britain differentiated through <b>the</b> <b>everyday</b> production <b>of</b> natural and social knowledge and <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> active citizen and new communities of practice...|$|R
40|$|Apuleius Madaurensis {{has written}} his Eleven Books Metamorphoses (or The Golden Ass) {{in the late}} second century of our era. This is the first fully extant {{specimen}} of an extended latin work of prose fiction. It is written in a Latin which {{on the one hand}} shows elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>the</b> <b>everyday</b> speech and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colloquial language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period, {{but on the other hand}} incorporates these elernents in a prose which bears the more general characteristics of an archaizing artificial language. For <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> Latin prose art as well as <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Latin <b>everyday</b> speech this work is an important monument, representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Latin prose art <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period.

25|$|Ira Shor, a {{professor}} at the City University of New York, provides for an example of how critical pedagogy is used in the classroom. He develops these themes in looking at the use of Freirean teaching methods in the context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>everyday</b> life of classrooms, in particular, institutional settings. He suggests that the whole curriculum of the classroom must be re-examined and reconstructed. He favors a change of role of the student from object to active, critical subject. In doing so, he suggests that students undergo a struggle for ownership of themselves. He states that students have previously been lulled into a sense of complacency by the circumstances of everyday life and that through the processes of the classroom, they can begin to envision and strive for something different for themselves.|$|E
25|$|A typical episode {{features}} several vignettes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>everyday</b> {{life of a}} couple, {{with the}} camera mostly centered on them. Often other characters are cropped, giving the programme its unique visual style. The couple receive friends for supper, go to the convenience store, or leave on a trip, and sometimes get on each other's nerves. Their quirks, and loving bickering, provide much of the program's humor. The graphic design style associated with the original Un gars, une fille, which consists of a palette of pastel blue and pink, and rough lines and scribbles, (seen in the transition graphics, see Original section), {{as well as a}} logo with simulated printing mistakes and smears, has been imitated by most of the other versions, with the notable exception of the American version. The character names are often those of the actors, as in the first version.|$|E
25|$|Christians and Jews in the sultanate were {{governed by}} the dual {{authority}} of their respective religious institutions and the sultan. The authority of the former extended to many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>everyday</b> aspects of Christian and Jewish life and was not restricted to the religious practices of the two respective communities. The Mamluk government, often under the official banner of the Pact of Umar which gave Christians and Jews dhimmi (protected peoples) status, ultimately determined the taxes that Christians and Jews paid to the sultanate, including the jizyah (poll tax), whether a house of worship could be constructed and the public appearance of Christians and Jews. Jews generally fared better than Christians, and the latter experienced more difficulty under Mamluk rule than under previous Muslim powers. The association of Christians with the Mongols, due to the latter's use of Armenian and Georgian Christian auxiliaries, the attempted alliance between the Mongols and the Crusader powers, and the massacre of Muslim communities and the sparing of Christians in cities captured by the Mongols, {{may have contributed to}} rising anti-Christian sentiments in the Mamluk era. The manifestations of anti-Christian hostility were mostly spearheaded at the popular level rather than under the direction of Mamluk sultans. The main source of popular hostility was resentment at the privileged positions many Christians held in the Mamluk bureaucracy.|$|E

25|$|In Canada, {{even though}} volcanoes pose {{significant}} threats to local communities and any sizable eruption would affect Canada's economy, {{the work of}} understanding the frequency and eruption characteristics at volcanoes in Canada is a slow process. This is because most of Canada's dormant and potentially active volcanoes are located in isolated jagged regions, very few scientists study Canadian volcanoes {{and the provision of}} money in the Canadian government is limited. Because of these issues, scientists studying Canada's volcanoes have a basic understanding of Canada's volcanic heritage and how it might impact people in the future. Volcanologists are aware that certain areas in Canada have higher levels of volcanic activity than others and how eruptions in these areas might affect people and the environment they live in. When a volcano is showing evidence of volcanic activity, quick action will be required to better understand the process. The lowest possibility for an eruption in Canada per year is approximately 1/200; for a passive lava eruption the possibility is about 1/220, and for a major explosive eruption it is about 1/3333. Even though volcanoes {{do not seem to be}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>everyday</b> reality of Canadians, recurrent earthquakes and the formation of large mountain ranges in the Pacific Northwest indicate this part of Canada is still geologically active. The possibility of an eruption, even a large explosive one, cannot be ruled out. Quiet as they currently seem, volcanoes in Northern and Western Canada are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Along with volcanoes associated with recent earthquake activity, a scenario of an eruption at Mount Cayley in southwestern British Columbia illustrates how Western Canada is in danger to a volcanic eruption, which has not erupted for at least 310,000years. This impact is becoming even more likely as population in the Pacific Northwest increases and development spreads. The scenario is based on former eruptions in the north-south trending Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and includes both explosive and passive eruptions. Its effect is mostly due to the attention of defenseless public services in canyons. However, the threat from volcanoes outside of Canada seems much greater than the threat from volcanoes within Canada because of the lack of monitoring data at Canadian volcanoes and the age of most volcanoes in Canada is poorly known. But for some, their minimal degree of erosion indicates they formed much less than 10,000years ago, including the Milbanke Sound Group on Price Island, Dufferin Island, Swindle Island, Lake Island, and Lady Douglas Island in the Milbanke Sound area of coastal British Columbia. However, it is known volcanoes in the U.S. states of Alaska, Washington, Oregon and California have been more active in historic times than those within Canada. Therefore, volcanoes in the United States are monitored with caution and attention by the United States Geological Survey.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century, lyric poetry was {{associated}} with male poets and quotidian poetry (i.e., the poetry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>everyday)</b> with female poets. The division of labour in Midas reflects this trend: Percy contributed the two lyric poems in the drama while Mary's play contains the kind of detail found in the poetry of other women. However, Mary Shelley does not simply accept these gender-genre distinctions. As Richardson explains, [...] "soliloquy is resisted in the first act and exposed in the second act as a questionable and implicitly masculine mode". Furthermore, the disjunction between Percy Shelley's poems, spoken by Apollo and Pan in the first act, and Mary Shelley's verse drama has often bothered critics. Yet, Richardson argues that this was intended, to highlight the difference in poetic mode.|$|E
500|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th century, {{electricity}} {{was not part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>everyday</b> life of many people, even in the industrialised Western world. The popular culture of the time accordingly often depicts it as a mysterious, quasi-magical force that can slay the living, revive the dead or otherwise bend the laws of nature. This attitude began with the 1771 experiments of Luigi Galvani in which the legs of dead frogs were shown to twitch on application of animal electricity. [...] "Revitalization" [...] or resuscitation of apparently dead or drowned persons {{was reported in the}} medical literature shortly after Galvani's work. These results were known to Mary Shelley when she authored Frankenstein (1819), although she does not name the method of revitalization of the monster. The revitalization of monsters with electricity later became a stock theme in horror films.|$|E
