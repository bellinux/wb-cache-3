40|$|This paper {{presents}} an action language, called L mt, for representing and reasoning about commitments in multi-agent domains. The language {{is an extension}} of the language L, with new features motivated by the problem of representing and reasoning about commitments. These features include time, delayed effects, ir/reversible effects, concurrent actions, and multi-agents, for specifying and reasoning about narratives in multi-agent domains. The paper provides a transition-based semantics for L mt, which makes it possible to define an entailment relation between queries and multi-agent narratives with time constraints. The paper also demonstrates how features and properties of commitments can be described in this action language. In particular, it shows how L mt can handle both simple commitment actions as well as complex commitment protocols. Furthermore, the semantics of L mt provides a uniform solution to different problems in reasoning about commitments such as the problem of (i) verifying whether an agent fails (or succeeds) to deliver on its commitments; (ii) identifying outstanding commitments; and (iii) suggesting ways to satisfy <b>outstanding</b> <b>commitments.</b> ...|$|E
