This study aimed to compare the safety, acceptance, and efficacy of 2 -L <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> electrolyte solution enriched in vitamin C with 4 -L <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> electrolyte solution. This study is an endoscopist-blinded randomized controlled trial. The study was conducted at a tertiary referral hospital.

Safety was assessed by blood sampling before and after the preparation and by a 30 -day postcolonoscopy chart and complication database review. Acceptance was investigated by questionnaires, and the adequacy of bowel preparation was assessed by the Aronchick and Ottawa scales. One hundred eighty-eight patients, 98 in the <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> electrolyte solution enriched in vitamin C group and 90 in the <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> electrolyte solution group, participated. Although changes in bicarbonate blood concentrations with <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> electrolyte solution enriched in vitamin C were seen {{to such an extent that}} the blinded investigator correctly guessed the preparation in 75. 6 %, no unsafe values were observed. A 30 -day chart and complication database review revealed 1 severe adverse event of a myocardial infarction in the <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> electrolyte solution enriched in vitamin C group. Patient acceptance and compliance were significantly higher with the <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> electrolyte solution enriched in vitamin C group. The impact on sleep, daily activities, and physical complaints were similar in both groups. <b>Polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> electrolyte solution enriched in vitamin C was noninferior to <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> electrolyte solution in cleansing efficacy, but the segmental rating of excellent and good preparation in right and transverse colon was significantly better for <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> electrolyte solution, especially when taken as a split dose.

Thus, we herein review and summarize the findings of studies conducted both within and beyond China that have examined the repair of spinal cord injury using <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> The following summarizes the results of studies using <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> alone as well as coupled with polymers or hydrogels: (1) <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> as an adjustable biomolecule carrier resists nerve fiber degeneration, reduces the inflammatory response, inhibits vacuole and scar formation, and protects nerve membranes in the acute stage of spinal cord injury. (2) Polyethylene glycol-coupled polymers not only promote angiogenesis but also carry drugs or bioactive molecules to the injury site. Because such polymers cross both the blood-spinal cord and blood-brain barriers, they {{have been widely used}} as drug carriers. (3) <b>Polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> hydrogels have been used as supporting substrates for the growth of stem cells after injury, inducing cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Simultaneously, <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> hydrogels isolate or reduce local glial scar invasion, promote and guide axonal regeneration, cross the transplanted area, and re-establish synaptic connections with target tissue, thereby promoting spinal cord repair.

We developed a method for the simultaneous determination of gut permeability to Mr 400, Mr 1500, Afr 4000 and Mr 10000 <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> by applying a single oral dose of an appropriate mixture of these <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycols.</b> After extraction from 24 h-urine, MT 1500, A/r 4000 and MT 10000 <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> were quantified by size exclusion chromatography, while Mr 400 <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> was determined by reversed phase chromatography. The detection limit of <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> in the relative molecular mass r nge between Mr 1500 and Μτ 10000 was found to be 0. 2 mg/ 1 urine, and the detection limit of Afr 400 <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> 5 mg/ 1 urine. Recovery of the <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycols</b> (N = 6) were 86. 6 % (CV: 4. 8 %) for H 400, 94. 1 % (CV: 7. 2 %) for Mr 1500, 97. 1 % (CV: 5. 5 %) for Mr 4000 and 97. 4 % (CV: 5. 6 %) for Mr 10000.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study whether {{lactulose}} or <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> {{is effective}} to promote defecation in critically ill patients, whether {{either of the}} two is superior, and whether the use of enteral laxatives is related to clinical outcome. DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. SETTING: Two tertiary intensive care units. PATIENTS: Three hundred and eight consecutive patients with multiple organ failure were included when receiving mechanical ventilation and intravenous circulatory support and when defecation did not occur on day 3 after admission. INTERVENTIONS: Thrice daily administration of lactulose, <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> or placebo until defecation occurred, to a maximum of 4 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The number of patients with defecation during the study period was 32 of 103 (31 %) for placebo, 76 of 110 (69 %) for lactulose, and 70 of 95 (74 %) for <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> (p =. 001 for lactulose and <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> vs. placebo). Lactulose and polyethylene glycol-treated patients produced stools after a median of 36 and 44 hrs, respectively, compared with 75 hrs for the placebo group (p =. 001 for lactulose and <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> vs. placebo). Length of stay {{in the intensive care unit}} was a median of 156 hrs for the lactulose group, 190 hrs for the <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> group, and 196 hrs for the placebo group (p =. 001). Intestinal pseudoobstruction or Ogilvie's syndrome occurred in 4. 1 % of patients in the placebo group, 5. 5 % of patients in the lactulose group, and 1. 0 % of patients in the <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> group. There was no difference in hospital mortality. Administration of morphine was associated with a longer time before first defecation, except in the <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> group. For all groups, defecation within 6 days after admission was associated with a shorter length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Both lactulose and <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> are more effective in promoting defecation than placebo. Patients receiving <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> had a slightly lower incidence of acute intestinal pseudoobstruction, whereas length of stay was shorter in lactulose-treated patients. Morphine administration was associated with delayed defecation except in the polyethylene glycol-treated group. Irrespective of study medication, early defecation was associated with a shorter length of sta...|$|R
40|$|The water {{relations}} of pepper plants (Capsicum frutescens L.) under conditions conducive to guttation were studied {{to evaluate the}} control of plant water stress with <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycols.</b> The addition of <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> 6000 to the nutrient solution resulted in water relations similar to those expected in soil at the same water potentials. Specifically, xylem pressure potential in the root and leaf became more negative during a 24 -hour treatment period, while osmotic potential of the root xylem sap remained constant. The decrease in pressure potential was closely correlated with the decrease in osmotic potential of the nutrient solution. In contrast, the addition of <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> 400 to the nutrient medium resulted in a reduction of osmotic potential in the root xylem sap; this osmotic adjustment in the xylem was large enough to establish an osmotic gradient for entry of water and cause guttation at a nutrient solution osmotic potential of − 4. 8 bars. Pressure potential in the root and leaf xylem became negative only at nutrient solution osmotic potentials lower than − 4. 8 bars. About half of the xylem osmotic adjustment {{in the presence of}} <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> 400 was caused by increased accumulation of K+, Na+, Ca 2 +, and Mg 2 + in the root xylem. These studies indicate that larger <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> molecules such as <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> 6000 are more useful for simulating soil water stress than smaller molecules such as <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> 400...|$|R

40|$|Linear alkyl ethoxylates (<b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> alkyl ethers) were {{fermented}} {{completely to}} methane and CO 2 in enrichment cultures inoculated with anoxic sewage sludge. Long-chain fatty acids were released as intermediates. No degradation {{was found with}} polypropylene glycol and polypropylene glycol-containing surfactants. Two types of primary ethoxylate-degrading bacteria were isolated and characterized. Both degraded <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycols</b> with molecular weights of 1, 000 completely. Strain KoB 35 fermented <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> ethoxyethanol, and lactate to acetate and propionate and {{was assigned to the}} described species Pelobacter propionicus. Strain KoB 58 converted <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and many other substrates to acetate only and was assigned to the genus Acetobacterium.
