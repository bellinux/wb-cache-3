Thomas Holtz found Appalachiosaurus to be an albertosaurine in 2004, but his more recent unpublished work locates it just outside Tyrannosauridae, in agreement with <b>other</b> <b>authors.</b>|$|E

5|$|Many {{allopatric}} forms previously {{regarded as}} conspecific are treated by Rasmussen and Anderton as full species.

5|$|Several <b>other</b> <b>authors</b> {{suggested}} similar taxonomic rearrangements {{around the}} same time. In 1979, Herbert Thomas and Surinder Verma agreed that Indraloris and Sivaladapis were adapids, but placed them in a subfamily of their own, Sivaladapinae. Also in 1979, Frederick Szalay and Eric Delson placed Indraloris in its own tribe, Indralorisini, within Adapidae. In 1980, Indian paleontologists S.R.K. Chopra and R.N. Vasishat placed both of Pilgrim's Sivanasua species in Indraloris and argued that Indraloris lulli, Sivanasua himalayensis and Sivanasua nagrii all represented the same species—Indraloris himalayensis. They listed Sivanasua palaeindica as a second Indraloris species, I.palaeindica, and continued to regard Indraloris as a lorisid. Gingerich and Sahni published in more detail on Sivaladapis in 1984. They then placed the two genera in a separate subfamily of Adapidae, called Sivaladapinae because that name was published two months before Indralorisini. In 1985, Vasishat continued to classify Indraloris and Sivaladapis in a single genus, and Indraloris himalayensis and Sivaladapis nagrii in a single species, but <b>other</b> <b>authors</b> have not followed this classification.|$|E
