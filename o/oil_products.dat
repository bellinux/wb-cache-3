According to the government, if <b>oil</b> <b>products</b> consumption had not been managed, {{consumption of}} gasoline would have increased to 120 million liters per day, while by reforming consumption pattern the figure has fallen to 60 million liters per day.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{thermochemical}} conversion (TCC) process {{was developed to}} convert swine manure into an <b>oil</b> <b>product</b> in a high temperature and pressure environment. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the effects of different process gases, including CO, H 2, CO 2, N 2, and compressed air, on the efficiencies of oil production and waste reduction, and to explore the possibility of replacing costly reducing process gases, such as CO, with an inexpensive inert gas such as compressed air. It was found that the addition of a process gas to the reaction system before the experiment was critical for the TCC process to yield an <b>oil</b> <b>product.</b> Both reducing gases (such as CO and H 2) and inert gases (such as CO 2, N 2, and compressed air) can be used as a process gas. With the addition of reducing gases (i. e., CO and H 2), the process yielded a better quality <b>oil</b> <b>product</b> and achieved a higher oil production efficiency. There were no significant differences in the chemical oxygen demand reduction rate among the five process gases mentioned above. The pressurized process created by water vapor alone did not yield an <b>oil</b> <b>product.</b> It is unclear why the inert gases of N 2, CO 2, and compressed air affected the <b>oil</b> <b>product</b> formation from swine manure but water vapor did not...|$|R

After receiving the request, W. J.

He was very likely offered the job by O'Brien because he was fluent in German, and Glidden had just purchased a modern continuous countercurrent solvent extraction plant from Germany for the extraction of vegetable oil from soybeans for paints and other uses.|$|E
5|$|Soviet rail {{transport}} became, after the Great Patriotic War, {{one of the}} most developed in the world, surpassing most of its First World counterparts. The Soviet railway system was growing in size, at a rate of 639km a year from 1965 to 1980, while the growth of {{rail transport}} in First World countries was either decreasing or stagnating. This steady growth in rail transport {{can be explained by the}} country's need to extract its natural resources, most of which were located close to, or in Siberia. While some problems with the railways had been reported by the Soviet press, the Soviet Union could boast of controlling {{one of the most}} electrified railway systems at the time. During much of the country's later lifespan, trains usually carried coal, oil, construction material (mostly stone, cement and sand) and timber. Oil and <b>oil</b> <b>products</b> were one of the key reasons for building railway infrastructure in Siberia in the first place.|$|E
5|$|The {{labour force}} is 2.45million people, of whom 7.1 per cent are {{employed}} in agriculture, 35.2 per cent {{are employed in}} industry and 57.7 per cent are employed in the services sector. Extraction of metals and minerals, production of chemicals, machinery and vehicle components, petroleum refining and steel are among the major industrial activities. Mining and its related industries employ a total of 120,000 people and generate about five per cent of the country's GDP. Bulgaria is Europe's sixth-largest coal producer. Local deposits of coal, iron, copper and lead are vital for the manufacturing and energy sectors. Almost all top export items of Bulgaria are industrial commodities such as <b>oil</b> <b>products,</b> copper products and pharmaceuticals. Bulgaria is also a net exporter of agricultural and food products, of which two-thirds go to OECD countries. It is the largest global producer of perfumery essential oils such as lavender and rose oil. Agriculture has declined significantly {{in the past two}} decades. Production in 2008 amounted to only 66 per cent of that between 1999 and 2001, while cereal and vegetable yields have dropped by nearly 40 per cent since 1990. Of the services sector, tourism is the most significant contributor to economic growth. In recent years, Bulgaria has emerged as a travelling destination with its inexpensive resorts and beaches outside the reach of the tourist industry. Lonely Planet ranked it among its top 10 destinations for 2011. Most of the visitors are British, Romanian, German and Russian. The capital Sofia, the medieval capital Veliko Tarnovo, coastal resorts Golden Sands and Sunny Beach and winter resorts Bansko, Pamporovo and Borovets are some of the locations most visited by tourists.|$|E
