5|$|In Germany, {{sugar levels}} {{at time of}} harvest are an {{important}} consideration in the wine's production with prädikat levels measuring the sweetness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine.</b> Equally important to winegrowers is the balance of acidity between the green tasting malic acid and the more citrus tasting tartaric acid. In cool years, some growers will wait until November to harvest in hopes of having {{a higher level of}} ripeness and subsequent tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|The Oregon wine {{industry}} {{focuses on the}} higher-priced segments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> market. Oregon growers receive a higher average return per ton and a higher average revenue per case than do growers in other wine-producing regions in the United States. Despite producing a much smaller volume of wine, Oregon winery revenues per capita are {{comparable to those of}} New York and Washington.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace {{are usually not}} meant to be drunk young, but many are still best in the first years. Rieslings d'Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very suitable for the late harvest Vendange Tardive and the botrytized Sélection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up the sweetness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{volatile}} acidity was determined {{using the method}} described by McClements (2003), total acidity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> was determined by titration and concentration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acid was calculated. <b>The</b> residual acidity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> was also determined as described by McClements (2003) while the alcohol content was determined using the density method. <b>The</b> specific gravities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> were determined using the hydrometer method {{and the results were}} determined from the reading on the stem (Awe 2011). The total solid and total sugar content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> were determined using <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> McClements (2003) and the pH and temperature were determined using a digital pH metre and an analytical thermometer respectively.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the association between the physicochemical properties and sensory acceptance of Brazilian red wines by applying chemometric techniques. Therefore, three winemaking processes were carried out: a traditional winemaking process and two novel winemaking processes, pre-drying and static pomace. Significant differences could be identified amongst <b>the</b> physicochemical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> (P <  0. 001). The sensory results showed greater acceptance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> made after pre-drying <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grapes or from the static pomace, as compared to commercial brands. Cluster analysis and Multidimensional Scaling were successfully applied and their results demonstrated <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total phenolic content and color indexes on acceptance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wines.</b> <b>The</b> odor was associated with the alcohol content, acidity, dry extract, total and reducing sugars and <b>the</b> body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wines.</b> <b>The</b> flavor was associated with several physicochemical properties which influenced <b>the</b> overall acceptance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> samples...|$|R

5|$|In winemaking, fruit sugars are {{converted}} into alcohol by a fermentation process. If the must formed by pressing the fruit {{has a low}} sugar content, additional sugar may be added to raise the alcohol content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> in a process called chaptalization. In the production of sweet wines, fermentation may be halted before it has run its full course, leaving behind some residual sugar that gives the wine its sweet taste.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> {{produced}} and consumed from the 1880s was sweet, kosher wine when the Carmel Winery was established, until the 1980s, when more dry or semi-dry wines {{began to be}} {{produced and}} consumed after {{the introduction of the}} Golan Heights Winery’s first vintage. The winery was the first to focus on planting and making wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, white Riesling and Gewürztraminer. These wines are kosher and have won silver and gold medals in international competitions. Israeli wine is now produced by hundreds of wineries, ranging in size from small boutique wineries in the villages to large companies producing over ten million bottles per year, which are also exported worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The Champagne {{province}} {{is located}} near the northern limits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> world along the 49th parallel. The high altitude and mean annual temperature of 10°C (50°F) creates a difficult environment for wine grapes to fully ripen. Ripening is aided {{by the presence of}} forests which helps to stabilize temperatures and maintain moisture in the soil. The cool temperatures serve to produce high levels of acidity in the resulting grape which is ideal for sparkling wine.|$|E

5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is a very}} {{bold and}} {{assertive}} wine that has potential to overwhelm light and delicate dishes. The wine's high tannin content {{as well as the}} oak influences and high alcohol levels associated with many regional styles play important roles in influencing how well the wine matches with different foods. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, all those elements are at their peak, but as the wine ages it mellows; possibilities for different food pairings open up. In most circumstances, matching the weight (alcohol level and body) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> to the heaviness of the food is an important consideration. Cabernet Sauvignons with high alcohol levels do not pair well with spicy foods due to hotness levels of the capsaicins present in spices like chili peppers being enhanced by the alcohol with the heat accentuating the bitterness of the tannins. Milder spices, such as black pepper, pair better due to their ability to minimize the perception of tannins—such as in the classic pairings of Cabernet Sauvignon with steak au poivre and pepper-crusted ahi tuna.|$|E
5|$|In 1838 William Macarthur planted Riesling vines near Penrith in New South Wales. Riesling was {{the most}} planted white grape in Australia until the early 1990s when Chardonnay greatly {{increased}} in popularity. Riesling still flourishes in The Great Southern (in particular Mt Barker, Frankland River and Porongorup), Clare Valley, in particular the areas of Watervale and around the Polish Hill River, and the cooler Eden Valley and High Eden regions. The warmer Australian climate produces thicker skinned grapes, sometimes seven times the thickness of German grown grape. The grapes ripening in free drain soil composed of red soil over limestone and shale, producing a lean wine that as it matures produces toasty, honeycomb and lime aromas and flavors. It is common for Australian Rieslings to be fermented at low temperatures in stainless steel tanks with no oxidation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> and followed by earlier bottling.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, English wine {{producers}} have experimented with growing the variety in plastic tunnels which {{can create a}} greenhouse effect and protect the grapes from the less than ideal climate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> region. While the grape is permitted to be planted in some German wine regions (such as the Mosel), the vineyard sites best suited for ripening Cabernet are generally already occupied with Riesling; many producers are ill-inclined to uproot the popular German variety in favor of Cabernet Sauvignon. In the 1980s, inexpensive Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon was highly touted for its value and helped to establish that country's wine industry and garner it more international presence in the wine market. The grape is performing a similar function for many countries in Eastern Europe, including Turkey, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Slovenia, and Ukraine. It {{can be in the}} eastern Mediterranean wine regions of Cyprus, Greece, Israel and Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wine}} {{regions of the}} Left Bank, the Cabernet {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> has shown unique characteristics in the different regions. In Saint-Estèphe and Pessac-Léognan, the grape develops more mineral flavors. Aromas of violets are a characteristic of Margaux. Pauillac is noted by a strong lead pencil scent and Saint-Julien by cedar and cigar boxes. The Cabernet wines of the Moulis are characterized by their soft tannins and rich fruit flavors while the southern Graves region is characterized by strong blackcurrant flavors, though in less intense wines over all. The percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon used in the blend will depend on terroir and the winemakers styles {{as well as the}} vintage. The First Growth estates of Château Mouton Rothschild and Château Latour are noted for regularly producing wines with some of the highest percentage of Cabernet— often around 75%.|$|E
5|$|Sauvignon blanc can {{be greatly}} {{influenced}} by decisions in the winemaking process. One decision {{is the amount of}} contact that the must has with the skins of the grape. In {{the early years of the}} New Zealand wine industry, there were no wineries on the South Island which meant that freshly harvested grapes had to be trucked and then ferried to the North Island, often all the way up to Auckland. This allowed for prolonged exposure of the skins and juice which sharpened the intensity and pungency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine.</b> Some winemakers, like the Loire, intentionally leave a small amount of must to spend some time in contact with the skin for later blending purposes. Other winemakers, like in California, generally avoid any contact with the skin due to the reduced aging ability of the resulting wine.|$|E

Rather than compare them to <b>the</b> Côte d'Or, <b>wine</b> expert Tom Stevenson recommends thinking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Côte Chalonnaise as more of a better quality Mâconnais than a lower quality Côte de Beaune. Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan praises <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Côte Chalonnaise for their relative affordability {{in contrast to}} <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Côte d'Or.

5|$|The papacy further refined the {{practice}} in the Mass in the Late Middle Ages, holding that the clergy alone was allowed to partake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> in the Eucharist. This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy. The laity continued {{the practice}}s of pilgrimages, veneration of relics, and belief {{in the power of}} the Devil. Mystics such as Meister Eckhart (d. 1327) and Thomas à Kempis (d. 1471) wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life, which laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Besides mysticism, belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread, and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the Malleus Maleficarum, the most popular handbook for witch-hunters.|$|E
5|$|The {{style of}} Cabernet Sauvignon is {{strongly}} influenced by the ripeness of the grapes at harvest. When more on the unripe side, the grapes are high in pyrazines and will exhibit pronounced green bell peppers and vegetal flavors. When harvested overripe the wines can taste jammy and may have aromas of stewed blackcurrants. Some winemakers choose to harvest their grapes at different ripeness levels in order to incorporate these different elements and potentially add some layer of complexity to the wine. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, the wines typically exhibit strong fruit flavors of black cherries and plum. The aroma of blackcurrants {{is one of the}} most distinctive and characteristic element of Cabernet Sauvignon that is present in virtually every style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> across the globe. Styles from various regions and producers may also have aromas of eucalyptus, mint and tobacco. As the wines age they can sometimes develop aromas associated with cedar, cigar boxes and pencil shavings. In general New World examples have more pronounced fruity notes while Old World wines can be more austere with heightened earthy notes.|$|E

50|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> special {{soil and}} the mild climate along <b>the</b> Main river, <b>wines</b> {{with a very}} high {{mineralization}} can be harvested. <b>The</b> amount <b>of</b> minerals in <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> {{is a factor in}} the quality testing every Franconian wine has to overcome.

They travel to a Moroccan port, {{and along the way}} are attacked by Tuareg tribesmen, defending themselves with French MAS-36 rifles. At the port, members of his old crew kidnap the Captain after he recognises their disguised Karaboudjan. Tintin meets Thomson and Thompson who got his message, and they learn that the wealthy merchant Omar ben Salaad sold the crab tins; Tintin tells Thomson and Thompson to discreetly investigate. Tintin tracks down the gang and saves the Captain, but they both become intoxicated by the fumes from wine barrels breached in a shootout with the villains. Haddock chases a gang-member from the cellar to an entrance behind a bookcase in Salaad's house. Upon sobering up, Tintin discovers a necklace of a crab with golden claws on the now-subdued owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> cellar, Omar ben Salaad, and realizes that he {{is the leader of the}} drug cartel. Allan steals a boat and tries escaping, but Tintin captures him. The police arrest the gang and free the Japanese man, who introduces himself as Bunji Kuraki, a police detective who was trying to warn Tintin of the group he was up against. He had been investigating the sailor on Haddock's crew who drowned; the sailor was on the verge of bringing him opium before he was eliminated. Turning on the radio, Tintin learns that, thanks to him, the entire organisation of the Crab with the Golden Claws is behind bars.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} causes for the {{perception}} in wine faults, including poor hygiene at the winery, excessive or insufficient exposure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> to oxygen, excessive or insufficient exposure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> to sulphur, overextended maceration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> either pre- or post-fermentation, faulty fining, filtering and stabilization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine,</b> {{the use of}} dirty oak barrels, over-extended barrel aging {{and the use of}} poor quality corks. Outside of the winery, other factors within the control of the retailer or end user <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> can contribute to the perception of flaws in the wine. These include poor storage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> that exposes it to excessive heat and temperature fluctuations as well as the use of dirty stemware during wine tasting that can introduce materials or aromas to what was previously a clean and fault-free wine.|$|E
