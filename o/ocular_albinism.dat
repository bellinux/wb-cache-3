40|$|Purpose: To {{elucidate}} the molecular genetics defect of <b>ocular</b> cutaneous <b>albinism.</b> Methods: One {{member of a}} family affected with <b>ocular</b> cutaneous <b>albinism</b> was studied to characterize the clinical phenotype and identify the disease-causing mutation. The family members were examined with ophthalmoscopy, electroretinography, and Goldmann perimetry. Clinical features comprises congenital nystagmus, iris transillumination, foveal hypoplasia and fundus hypopgmentation. The complete coding sequence of the TRP 1 gene, on chromosome 9, including the exon-intron boundaries, was amplified by PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Direct DNA sequencing analysis was performed and compared to TRP 1 consensus sequences obtained from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Results: This analysis revealed a novel homozygous missense mutation, c. G 869 A on exon 4. This nucleotide variation leads to the aminoacid change cysteine to tyrosine (p. C 290 Y).

40|$|Albinism is a {{heterogeneous}} group of genetic disorders that affect 1 in 20, 000 individuals worldwide, although {{the prevalence of}} the different subtypes of albinism varies considerably among the different ethnic backgrounds. It is caused by deficiencies in pigmentation, and clinically is divided into <b>ocular</b> and oculocutaneous <b>albinism</b> [1 - 3]. Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is {{a heterogeneous}} and autosomal recessive disorder that involves a lack of pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes, and is accompanied by optic defects such as photophobia, strabismus, poor vision, and nystagmus [2, 4, 5]. It is identified as nonsyndromic OCA (if the muta-tions occur in the TYR, OCA 2, TYRP 1, MATP (SLC 45 A 2), SLC 24 A 5, or C 10 ORF 11 genes) or syndromic OCA (if the mutations occur in the HPS 1, AP 3 B 1, HPS 3, HPS 4, HPS 5...|$|R

40|$|The starry {{flounder}} Platichthys stellatus, like all flatfish, exhibits conspicuous lateral asymmetry in numerous traits, most obvious {{of which is}} the migration of one eye {{to the other side of}} the head during metamorphosis. Additional changes related to eye migra-tion include asymmetrical pigmentation, and a behavioral shift from larvae that exhibit upright, open-water swimming to juveniles and adults that lie on the ocean floor, eye side up. However, the morphology of these juveniles has been quite plastic in recent years, a phenomenon which is thought to be related to a diverse suite of semi-intensive and intensive larviculture methods. The cause of morphological abnormalities in the farmed flatfish is poorly understood. In the present study, we observe the features of morphological specificity and abnormality of immature fish (mean total length 23 cm) and survey the occurrence frequency of the specificity and abnormality of juvenile (mean total length 6. 70 cm) in artificial culture facility. We find 2 types of abnormality (e. g., albino in ocular side and hypermelanosis in blind side) and 1 type of specificity (e. g., lateral polymorphism). These considerably differ from normal individuals (has sinistral eye and pigmented on only one side) by several characteristics (dextral eye, <b>ocular</b> side <b>albinism,</b> blind side hypermelanosis). The incidences of albinism, hypermelanosis, and body reversal are 10. 1 ± 2. 56 %, 91. 7 ± 1. 7 %, and 13. 1 ± 1. 1 %, respectively. These suggest that these morphometric and morphological differences occur more in artificial environment during and just after metamorphosis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} disorder characterized by partial <b>ocular</b> and cutaneous <b>albinism,</b> increased susceptibility to pyogenic infections, the presence of large lysosomal-like organelles in most granule-containing cells and a bleeding tendency. The abnormal granules are most readily seen in blood and marrow leukocytes, especially granulocytes; and in melanocytes. Other clinical features include silvery hair, photophobia, horizontal and rotatory nystagmus and hepatosplenomegaly. Materials and Methods: The clinico-hematological profile {{of a series of}} 5 cases of CHS encountered at JIPMER Hospital with diagnostic work-up done in the Department of Pathology over the last 6 years is presented. The diagnostic work-up included complete hemogram with peripheral smear, bone marrow examination, skin and liver biopsies. Results: The age of the patients ranged from 5 months to 3 years. All patients had silvery hair and partial albinism and presented with fever and recurrent chest infection. Two patients were stable. Three patients were in accelerated phase; of them, 1 patient with associated hemophagocytic syndrome had a rapidly fulminant course. Peripheral blood smear showed anomalously large granules in the leukocytes. Skin biopsy showed sparse, coarse melanin pigment in the epidermis, and liver biopsy done in 2 patients with accelerated phase showed portal lymphohistiocytic aggregates. Conclusions: The diagnostic hallmark of CHS is the occurrence of giant inclusion bodies (granules) in the peripheral leukocyte and their bone marrow precursors. The case series is being presented because of the rarity of CHS and varied spectrum of clinical and hematological presentation...|$|R

50|$|The {{chance of}} {{offspring}} with albinism {{resulting from the}} pairing of an organism with albinism and one without albinism is low. However, because organisms (including humans) can be carriers of genes for albinism without exhibiting any traits, albinistic offspring can be produced by two non-albinistic parents. Albinism usually occurs with equal frequency in both sexes. An exception to this is <b>ocular</b> <b>albinism,</b> which it is passed on to offspring through X-linked inheritance. Thus, <b>ocular</b> <b>albinism</b> occurs more frequently in males as they have a single X and Y chromosome, unlike females, whose genetics are characterized by two X chromosomes.|$|E

This encoded protein is found as a subunit in corepressor SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors) complex along with histone deacetylase 3 protein. This gene is located adjacent to the <b>ocular</b> <b>albinism</b> gene and it is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of the <b>ocular</b> <b>albinism</b> with late-onset sensorineural deafness phenotype.
