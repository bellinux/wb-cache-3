5|$|This {{station was}} rebuilt as Ashford International {{during the early}} 1990s for {{international}} services from mainland Europe; this included the addition of two platforms {{to the north of}} station (the original down island platform had been taken over by international services). Unlike normal LGV stations in France, the through tracks for Ashford International railway station are <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> rather than going through. The number of services was reduced after the opening of the Ebbsfleet station. A high-speed domestic service operated by Southeastern to London St Pancras began on 29 June 2009.|$|E
5|$|Player {{controls}} include clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, forward thrust, firing torpedoes, and hyperspace. Initially {{these were}} controlled using the front-panel test {{switches on the}} PDP-1 minicomputer, with four switches for each player, but these proved to be awkward to use and wore out quickly under normal gameplay, as well as causing players to accidentally flip the computer's control and power switches. The location of the switches also left one player <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the CRT display due to the limited space {{in front of the}} computer, which left them at a disadvantage. To alleviate these problems, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. The gamepad had a switch for turning left or right, another for forward thrust or hyperspace, and a torpedo launch button. The button was silent so that the opposing player would not have a warning that the player was attempting to fire a torpedo during a cooldown period.|$|E

25|$|Negative {{reactions}} to Maya Lin's design created a controversy; a compromise was reached by commissioning Frederick Hart (who had placed {{third in the}} original design competition) to produce a bronze figurative sculpture in the heroic tradition. Opponents of Lin's design had hoped to place this sculpture of three soldiers {{at the apex of}} the wall's two sides. Lin objected strenuously to this, arguing that this would make the soldiers {{the focal point of the}} memorial, and her wall a mere backdrop. A compromise was reached, and the sculpture was placed <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> to minimize the impact of the addition on Lin's design. On October 13, 1982, the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts approved the erection of a flagpole to be grouped with sculptures.|$|E
25|$|The playfield is a {{planar surface}} {{inclined}} upward {{from three to}} seven degrees (current convention is {{six and a half}} degrees), away from the player, and includes multiple targets and scoring objectives. Some operators intentionally extend threaded levelers on the rear legs and/or shorten or remove the levelers on the front legs to create additional incline in the playfield, making the ball move faster and harder to play. It is important that the playfield be level left-to-right; a quick visual test compares the top of the back cabinet against a brick or block wall behind it, or to roll a marble {{down the center of the}} playfield glass. If it clearly rolls <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> a player may be inclined to stuff folded paper beneath the legs on the lower side to level the playfield. Additionally, leg levelers that are all extended fully make the game easier to nudge; when collapsed low, the entire game is more stable, and nudging becomes harder.|$|E

500|$|Unlike most LGV {{stations}} in France, the through tracks for Ashford International station are <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> {{rather than going}} through, partly because the station pre-dates the line. High Speed 1 approaches Ashford International from the north in a cut-and-cover [...] "box"; the southbound line rises out of this cutting and crosses over the main tracks to enter the station. The main tracks then rise out of the cutting and over a flyover. On leaving Ashford, southbound Eurostars return to the high-speed line by travelling under this flyover and joining from the outside. [...] The international platforms at Ashford are supplied with both overhead 25kV AC and third-rail 750 V DC power, avoiding the need to switch power supplies.|$|E

Lene Schneider-Kainer, (16 May, 1885, Vienna, Austria - 15 June, 1971, Cochabamba, Bolivia), was a Jewish-Austrian artist, daughter of the painter Sigmund Schneider. She studied art throughout Europe, and married Ludwig Kainer in 1910. Schneider-Kainer made her debut as an artist in 1917 with an exhibition at the Galerie Gurlitt, and through the 1920 s Lene Schneider-Kainer became renowned as painter and illustrator. In 1926 Lene left Berlin after her divorce and for two years accompanied the poet Bernhard Kellermann on an extended odyssey retracing the steps of Marco Polo. She painted, photographed and sketched her impressions, and these contributions appeared regularly in the Berliner Tageblatt. Due to the rise of the Nazis she settled in Mallorca in 1932, and later Ibiza. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she left for New York. She continued to exhibit successfully around the world, and in 1954 she settled in Bolivia, where she assisted her son in establishing a textile factory. digitizedDigital imag...|$|R
50|$|The museum gives broad {{coverage}} {{of the history of}} the Jews in Romania. Displays include an enormous collection of books written, published, illustrated, or translated by Romanian Jews; a serious archive of the history of Romanian Jewry; a collection of paintings of and by Romanian Jews that, while relatively small, consists of works of a calibre worthy of a major art museum (many of the same artists' works hang in the National Museum of Art); memorabilia from Jewish theaters including the State Jewish Theater; a medium-sized display devoted to Zionism; a small but pointed display of anti-Semitic posters and tracts; two rooms <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a <b>side,</b> <b>one</b> dealing with the Holocaust era from a historical point of view, the other a Holocaust memorial; discussion of both favorable and unfavorable treatment of the Jews by various of Romania's historic rulers; in short, a museum devoted to looking seriously at the history of a particular ethnic group within a society. In contrast to its Hungarian equivalent in Budapest, this is not a museum that sees the exodus of the majority of the country's surviving Jews to Israel as a culmination: this museum is focused more on what that means for those who have stayed, what is the continuing contribution of Jews to Romanian culture, what has been, what is, and what will be the role of Jews in Romania.|$|R

Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the National Physical Laboratory which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges minimised turbulence.

500|$|He {{recalled}} later: [...] "He {{positioned himself}} <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of-and {{some distance away}} from-the last Il-2 in a formation of six. He then turned in quickly and opened fire at the enemy's cockpit from an angle of some 30 degrees. The Il-2 immediately burst into flames and crashed. 'Do you see how it's done?', Oberst Mölders' voice came over the R/T. 'Right, now you take the next one.' I carried out the same manoeuvre and, sure enough, the next Il-2 went down on fire. 'And again!' It was like being on a training flight. Another short burst and the third Il-2 was ablaze. The whole lesson had lasted no more than 12 minutes!" [...] In this way, Kaiser scored his 23rd and 24th kills. But because Mölders was officially banned from operational flying, the first Soviet aircraft was never officially credited to him. Within the next two months, it is speculated that Mölders unofficially shot down around another 30 Soviet aircraft. At least six of Mölders' unofficial victories are recorded in his fellow pilots' private log books.|$|E
500|$|Listed at 5ft 10 in (1.78 m) and 160 pounds (73kg), Pierce {{was also}} among the more {{diminutive}} pitchers to enjoy great success, and is likely the smallest pitcher since the 1920s to win 200 games. Sherm Lollar, his catcher for ten years in Chicago, noted that his lack of size didn't diminish his velocity, noting, [...] "He isn't too big, but he has wonderful coordination. And he sure is pretty to watch, the way he pumps and rocks and throws. Sometimes, when I'm not catching a game, I'll just go <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> and watch him pitch." [...] And Paul Richards noted, [...] "Pierce is a perfectionist who has achieved maximum potential out of the equipment nature gave him." [...] Pierce's size also belied his durability, as {{he was one of}} the few pitchers under [...] in height to lead the league in complete games since the 1920s, with Ned Garver, Frank Lary, Camilo Pascual and Fernando Valenzuela – all of whom were an inch taller and outweighed Pierce by at least 20 pounds – being the only other pitchers under six feet tall to lead the league more than once since the early 1930s. He remains the last pitcher to lead the AL in complete games three years in a row.|$|E
6000|$|In dark winter mornings, or {{in short}} winter afternoons, I {{sometimes}} heard {{a pack of}} hounds threading all the woods with hounding cry and yelp, unable to resist the instinct of the chase, and the note of the hunting-horn at intervals, proving that man was in the rear. The woods ring again, and yet no fox bursts forth on to the open level of the pond, nor following pack pursuing their Actæon. And perhaps at evening I see the hunters returning with a single brush trailing from their sleigh for a trophy, seeking their inn. They tell me that if the fox would remain in the bosom of the frozen earth he would be safe, or if he would run {{in a straight line}} away no foxhound could overtake him; but, having left his pursuers far behind, he stops to rest and listen till they come up, and when he runs he circles round to his old haunts, where the hunters await him. Sometimes, however, he will run upon a wall many rods, and then leap <b>off</b> far <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> and he appears to know that water will not retain his scent. A hunter told me that he once saw a fox pursued by hounds burst out on to Walden when the ice was covered with shallow puddles, run part way across, and then return to the same shore. Ere long the hounds arrived, but here they lost the scent. Sometimes a pack hunting by themselves would pass my door, and circle round my house, and yelp and hound without regarding me, as if afflicted by a species of madness, so that nothing could divert them from the pursuit. Thus they circle until they fall upon the recent trail of a fox, for a wise hound will forsake everything else for this. One day a man came to my hut from Lexington to inquire after his hound that made a large track, and had been hunting for a week by himself. But I fear that he was not the wiser for all I told him, for every time I attempted to answer his questions he interrupted me by asking, [...] "What do you do here?" [...] He had lost a dog, but found a man.|$|R

He {{is standing on}} the bottom of the porch stairs outside a house, wearing a three-piece suit and a bowler hat and looking <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the <b>side.</b> <b>One</b> of the double front doors is open. Edgar Odell Lovett, mathematics professor and president of Rice Institute (now Rice University), was born in Shreve, Ohio, on April 14, 1871, the son of Zephania and Maria Elizabeth (Spreng) Lovett. After graduating from Shreve High School he entered Bethany College, Bethany, West Virginia, where he graduated in 1890 at the age of nineteen. From 1890 until 1892 he was professor of mathematics at West Kentucky College; in 1892 he became an instructor at the University of Virginia, where he continued his studies and received the degree of M. A. and Ph. D. in 1895. The following year he studied in Europe at the universities of Christiana and Leipzig; he received M. A. and Ph. D. degrees from the latter in 1896. In 1897 Lovett lectured at Johns Hopkins University and the universities of Virginia and Chicago. In September of that year he became instructor in mathematics at Princeton University. He was promoted to assistant professor and head of the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy at Princeton. In 1907 he was asked to head Rice Institute, then being planned at Houston; he was recommended for the post by Woodrow Wilson, then president of Princeton. He accepted in 1908, moved to Houston, and was formally inaugurated as the first president of the institute on October 12, 1912; he continued in this capacity until his retirement on March 1, 1946. Thereafter, he was associated with Rice as president emeritus, director, and consultant. He was a member of many learned societies, including Phi Beta Kappa, the London Mathematical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Circolo Matematico di Palermo, Societe Mathematique de France, and the Royal Astronomical Society. The degree of L. L. D. was conferred on him by Drake University, Tulane University, Baylor University, and Bethany; that of Sc. D. was conferred upon him by Colorado College. In 1898 Lovett married Mary Ellen Hale of Mayfield, Kentucky; they had two daughters and two sons. He died on August 13, 1957, and was buried in Glenwood Cemetery, Houston.

2500|$|Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta. Although T. brevifolia is {{typically}} a tree as described above, T. brevifolia var. reptaneta is a shrub variety that generally {{occurs in the}} mid to upper elevation range of the typical variety, 3,500 to 4,000ft (1000–1219 m) at its southernmost occurrence in the Klamath Mountains region, and at lower elevations further north. [...] It is distinguished from young trees of the typical variety (var. brevifolia) by its stems initially creeping along the ground for a short distance before ascending (curving) upwards and by the branches growing <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the stem, usually the upper side. The epithet reptaneta is from the Latin reptans which means “creeping, prostrate, and rooting,” which is exactly what this variety does; in rooting it forms yew thickets; hence, the epithet reptaneta (etum means collective place of growth) and hence the common name, thicket yew. Unlike the typical variety, thicket yew grows in abundance on open sunny avalanche shoots or ravines {{as well as in the}} forest understory. [...] It also occurs along forest margins. In northwestern Montana, a variant of the thicket yew does not ascend upwards; rather, it remains along the ground. [...] This is probably the ancestral form; the upright form with branches along the upper side would be the expected growth pattern that might evolve from one with stems that strictly creep along the ground since branches can only arise from the upper surface.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{situation}} became clear, Alliance gradually slowed, allowing {{the rest of}} Jones’s squadron to catch up (except for the little schooner carrying the boarding party, which could not sail fast enough). About 6pm, Commodore Jones ordered Pallas to ride directly in his wake, to confuse the opposition about the squadron’s strength, and {{half an hour later}} he hoisted signals ordering all vessels to form a single-file line of battle, to make best use of their broadsides as they passed the two British ships. Captain Landais, who unlike Jones {{had a great deal of}} formal training in naval leadership and tactics (and was aware of the latest French battle plans, used with considerable success against the Royal Navy at this time), decided to try a different plan. He used Alliance’s superior handling to sail <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> against the wind. In order to prevent him from sailing right past and chasing the convoy, Captain Thomas Piercy of the Countess of Scarborough had to do the same, leaving Serapis alone against the remaining three American ships. Finally, a little after 7pm, Bonhomme Richard was within pistol-shot of the battle-ready Serapis. In the gathering dark, Pearson then hailed the potentially hostile ship to ask some pertinent questions: its name, its nationality etc. The answer was a few evasive remarks, followed by a shot (as he recalled it, but possibly a broadside) which Serapis answered with a broadside. A minute or two later, as soon as he was within range, Landais fired his own broadside at the Countess of Scarborough (theoretically just over [...] of shot from 18 guns). Piercy soon replied (his maximum broadside being about 60lb from 10 guns).|$|E
