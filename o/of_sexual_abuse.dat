In addition to Leon, Hendrix had three younger siblings: Joseph, born in 1949, Kathy in 1950, and Pamela, 1951, all of whom Al and Lucille gave up to foster care and adoption. The family frequently moved, staying in cheap hotels and apartments around Seattle. On occasion, family members would take Hendrix to Vancouver to stay at his grandmother's. A shy and sensitive boy, he was deeply affected by his life experiences.

The effect of child and adult <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> definitions on estimates of revictimization rates, and variables hypothesized to mediate revictimization were investigated. Revictimization was defined as the occurrence <b>of</b> adult <b>sexual</b> assault following child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b> Female university students (N = 654, mean age = 18. 9 years) completed self-report measures (i. e., childhood and adulthood sexual experiences questionnaires, Attributional Style Questionnaire, Coping Strategies Scale, and Parental Support Scale). Three definitions <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> and three definitions <b>of</b> adult <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> were investigated. The child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> definitions varied in the amount of contact with the perpetrator required for the experience to be considered abusive, and the adult sexual assault definitions varied in the amount of contact and the degree of force involved. As predicted, when restrictive definitions <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> (e. g., contact occurred) and adult sexual assault (e. g., contact with physical threat) were used, women with a history <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> reported significantly higher rates <b>of</b> adult <b>sexual</b> assault than women without a history <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b> When inclusive definitions <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> and adult <b>sexual</b> assault (e. g., noncontact experiences included as abusive) were used, no significant association between a history of abuse and revictimization was found. A model <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> revictimization was proposed, hypothesizing that parental support, attributional styles for negative events, strategies used to cope with the abuse, attributions about the abuse, and receiving therapy following the abuse mediated the occurrence <b>of</b> adult <b>sexual</b> assault. However, none of the proposed mediating variables significantly predicted revictimization among women with a history <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b> However, among women with no history <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse,</b> lack <b>of</b> maternal support and internal, stable, and global attributional styles for negative events significantly discriminated between women with and without an adult sexual assault history. Amount <b>of</b> adulthood <b>sexual</b> experience, maternal support, global, stable, and internal attributions, and child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> were found to be significant factors in predicting adult sexual assault among the total sample. A history <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> was found to be associated with significantly higher rates <b>of</b> adult <b>sexual</b> experience, as well as adult sexual assault. The data suggested that childhood <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> leads to increased sexual activity which in turn increases risk <b>of</b> adult <b>sexual</b> assault. It was recommended that future studies <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> revictimization use restrictive definitions <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> and adult <b>sexual</b> assault and investigate further the relationship between amount <b>of</b> adult <b>sexual</b> activity and revictimization...|$|R
40|$|Child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> {{has been}} a serious {{societal}} concern in the United States for some time. In Korea, the problem <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> is just now being recognized as a serious issue. Increased awareness {{of the problem in}} Korea has led to increased emphasis on its prevention and intervention. Clarifying the definition <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> is needed as a first step before efforts can begin to solve this serious social problem. Korean nurses occupy a very strategic position in working with child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> and its victims, since they may be the first individuals to have opportunity to recognize abuse victims;The goal {{of this study is to}} identify characteristics of Korean nurse perceptions about the definition <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b> Specifically, it is to examine to what extent various characteristics <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> and various background characteristics of nurses affect Korean nurses 2 ̆ 7 perceptions about the seriousness <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> incidents;Korean registered nurses, consisting of 503 hospital nurses and 526 school nurses, comprised the sample in this study. A total of 1, 102 questionnaires were distributed, of which 1, 030 were returned. Of these, one questionnaire was eliminated because of missing data, leaving a total of 1, 029 questionnaires that were coded and entered for analysis;A vignette design was used to assess Korean nurses 2 ̆ 7 perceptions <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b> Seven variables were organized in the 64 vignettes using a one-fourth fractional factorial design for this study. Respondents were given randomly selected and ordered samples of 16 of the 64 relevant vignettes.

Nurses 2 ̆ 7 background variables included professional affiliation and other demographic factors, exposure to media about child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse,</b> and past history <b>of</b> childhood <b>sexual</b> victimization. Respondents rated the seriousness <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> incidents in each of the vignettes included in their questionnaires;Results of logistic regression analyses of the vignette characteristics indicated that the intrusiveness <b>of</b> the <b>sexual</b> act has the greatest impact on the perceived seriousness <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse,</b> followed by victim resistance, cross-gender combinations of victim and perpetrator, and frequency <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> act. Logistic regression analyses for the nurse background characteristics suggested that respondent characteristics play a significantly smaller role in perceptions of seriousness <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> by Korean nurses. Only media exposure to child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> issues had prominent effect on the perceived seriousness <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> abuse;The findings suggested that the characteristics <b>of</b> the child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> incidents are the primary influence on the perception of the seriousness <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse,</b> not the characteristics of the Korean nurses;Implications for this study are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} relationship between justice and child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> {{from the perspective of}} adult survivors. Utilising participant observation, unstructured interviews and focus groups within a feminist framework, 21 adult survivors <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> (18 women and 3 men) were consulted to identify issues that were problematic for them. In addition, 2 jurors, 1 judge and 2 counsellors were interviewed. The findings indicated that child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> has been shrouded by a conspiracy of silence, caused partly by deeply entrenched structures within society. These forces combined with the complexity of recovery, including the possible impacts of Stockholm Syndrome, and the perceived inability {{of the criminal justice system}} to meet their needs, have appeared to silence many survivors <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b> A review <b>of</b> the economic consequences and an analysis of the subsequent costs <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> have indicated the need to implement programmes that would lessen the burden for victims, offenders, their families and the broader society. Survivors cautiously suggested that restorative justice might be sufficiently flexible to encourage victims <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> to criminally report, thereby breaking the silence. A cost benefit analysis of a restorative justice programme indicated that significant savings could be made and highlighted that the prevention <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> should be a priority. The findings of this research would have implications for policy makers and all those who provide services to victims and offenders <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b> Stockholm Syndrome has highlighted the complexity of the recovery process for victims <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b> This syndrome combined with the concerns of adult survivors <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> would have implications for practitioners within the traditional criminal justice system and the restorative justice movement.

Conclusions: Comparison of the present study with that of [Finkelhor, D. (1994). The international epidemiology <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b> Child Abuse & Neglect, 18 (5), 409 - 417] shows a similarity between prevalence distributions; {{there appears to be a}} general pattern that remains more or less constant over the years, especially in women. Practice implications: Twelve years after the first revision study about the international prevalence <b>of</b> child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse,</b> there is still a need for new data about this topic. The present study shows child <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> is still a widespread problem in the society. In this research, carried out on 38 independent studies, there is new data for 21 countries over the world, being especially relevant the results obtained from other countries different from those pertaining toNorth America or Europe. It is important to point out the high prevalence found in most of the countries, so this information could be a new warning to make society and governments aware of this problem and undertake actions to prevent <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> in childhood. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
