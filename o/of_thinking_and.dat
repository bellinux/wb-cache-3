5|$|Historian Matti Moosa {{considered}} Marrash to be {{the first}} truly cosmopolitan Arab intellectual and writer of modern times. Marrash adhered to the principles of the French Revolution and defended them in his own works, implicitly criticizing Ottoman rule in Western Asia and North Africa. He was also influential in introducing French romanticism in the Arab world, especially through his use of poetic prose and prose poetry, of which his writings were the first examples in modern Arabic literature, according to Salma Khadra Jayyusi and Shmuel Moreh. His modes <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> feeling, and ways of expressing them, have had a lasting influence on contemporary Arab thought and on the Mahjari poets.|$|E
5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} on the idea that all human beings have the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others when they do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs. Habits <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these needs are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their needs, the needs of others, and the feelings that surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E

Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E

In comparison to design thinking, scholarly discussion about systems thinking {{has a much}} longer history and includes more multiple and divergent perspectives. This paper reviews and critiques the essence <b>of</b> design <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> systems <b>thinking,</b> <b>and</b> proposes a new approach for design, the design-within approach, to elaborate on the possibilities of fostering a design culture. Through design-within, learners could be engaged in envisioning learning, and in systemically designing their own learning. The design-within approach is an alternative approach that synthesizes the truly systemic spirit <b>of</b> systems <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> the enlightening spirit of transformative design. Discussion includes the emergence <b>of</b> design <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> its multiple perspectives; the link between design <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> systems thinking; systems <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> open educational systems design; the essence <b>of</b> Senge's systems <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> its philosophical roots in both western and eastern culture; systems thinking as a language to be cultivated; comparison of Banathy's and Senge's systems thinking; and the design philosophy and roles of designers in the design-within approach.

40|$|In the {{increasingly}} popular {{area of research}} into creativity in education; students’ perceptions of creativity are an important consideration for developing a creative environment. Consequently, student’s perceptions <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> practice are a key resource for educators to be innovative in creating educational excellence. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate students’ perceptions about their art classroom environments which either stimulate or inhibit the development <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> practices, in girls’ intermediate schools (12 - 15 years) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. It addresses the following research question: Is it possible to improve perceptions <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> practices, <b>of</b> adolescent girls in Saudi Arabia, through control of art classroom environments? There were three parts to this study: firstly, the pre-intervention study to explore and identify a range of factors with potential to influence perceptions <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> practices; secondly, the main part of the study was the intervention to determine the impact of manipulating classroom variables with potential to influence perceptions <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> practices; and thirdly, follow up visits to determine whether the environmental changes, and the changes in perceptions, had continued. The samples used in the intervention study were students (n = 225) all from second year classes in nine secondary schools in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The research findings were obtained by observation using behaviour mapping and Likertscale questionnaires indicated that students’ perceptions <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> practices were improved through changing table and seating arrangement and wall displays. The contribution to new knowledge in this study will inform participants working within and related to the field of education and in particular art education, proposing considerations for appropriate improvements to learning environments by: · Developing a research process for identifying and testing environmental influences upon the perception <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> practices. · Evidencing how table and seating arrangement, and wall display, can improve perceptions <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> practice in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

The Group Embedded Figures Test(GEFT), the Group Assessment <b>of</b> Logical <b>Thinking</b> (GALT) <b>and</b> the Chemistry Achievement Test (CAT) were used to determine the students cognitive styles, level <b>of</b> cognitive <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> chemistry achievement respectively. A sample of 163 form four science students were involved in the research. The collected data were analyzed using the SPSS version 10. 0 for Windows software. Results showed that most of the students were Field Dependent and they were at the concrete level <b>of</b> cognitive <b>thinking.</b> The analysis <b>of</b> CAT indicated that their achievement was low. There was a weak relationship between the students cognitive styles, the level <b>of</b> cognitive <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> the chemistry achievement. This indicated that the chemistry achievement among the students was not very much influenced by the cognitive styles and the level cognitive thinking. Results also indicated that {{there was no significant difference}} between the cognitive styles, the level <b>of</b> cognitive <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> the chemistry achievement. Several recommendations were made at the end of the report on ways educators could accommodate the diverse cognitive styles, and the level <b>of</b> cognitive <b>thinking</b> as well as ways to improve students achievement in chemistry...|$|R

In particular Lawrence is concerned with the nature of relationships that can be had within such a setting. Though often classed as a realist, Lawrence in fact uses his characters to give form to his personal philosophy. His depiction of sexuality, though seen as shocking when his work was first published in the early 20th century, has its roots in this highly personal way <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> being.|$|E
