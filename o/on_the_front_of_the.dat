5|$|Many Canadian {{naval ships}} of World War II adopted an {{unofficial}} coat of arms, and Fredericton was no exception. Her badge, which was displayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge, was a flying tiger dropping a depth charge on a U-boat.|$|E

5|$|The {{individual}} {{cells in}} a plasma display contain {{a mixture of}} xenon and neon ionized with electrodes.

5|$|The {{specimen}} {{had serious}} puncture wounds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull, indicating {{that it had}} been preyed upon by a large carnivore.

Both artists' families supplied photographs for the book, while other pictures are credited to professional photographers Clive Arrowsmith, Dezo Hoffmann, Jan Steward and Carolyn Jones. The photo used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> box {{was one of a}} series of pictures that Arrowsmith took at Friar Park in 1974, over the period when the Music Festival orchestra were recording and rehearsing there.|$|E

5|$|A {{museum was}} opened inside the {{preserved}} building {{to mark the}} 100th birthday of Mikhail Bulgakov on May 15, 1991. The upper floor of the museum houses an exhibition of various Bulgakov objects, and the lower floor contains thematic exhibitions. The house, built in 1888 and designed by architect N. Gardenin, was thoroughly renovated before {{the opening of the}} museum. A memorial plaque with Bulgakov's portrait is now hanging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building.|$|E
5|$|Almost every silver siliqua in the hoard has had {{its edge}} clipped to some degree. This is typical of Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, {{although}} clipped coins are very unusual {{through the rest of}} the Roman Empire. The clipping process invariably leaves the imperial portrait <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coin intact, but often damages the mint mark, inscription, and the image on the obverse.|$|E
5|$|Another passive marking form is {{the word}} {{ambulance}} (or local language variant) spelled out in reverse <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle. This enables drivers of other vehicles to more easily identify an approaching ambulance in their rear view mirrors. Ambulances may display {{the name of their}} owner or operator, and an emergency telephone number for the ambulance service.|$|E

5|$|Forming {{the sides}} {{of the back of the}} skull is the exoccipital, which {{surrounds}} most of the foramen magnum. The Eustachian tube extends downwards across the basoccipital and basisphenoid; these bones are thickened on either side of the tube in K. langenbergensis. K. guimarotae has a small rounded foramen beside the tube on the basoccipital, and a tuberosity bearing a ridge above. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basoccipital in both species, there are two rounded depressions near the bottom. The basisphenoid resembles a triangular hatchet in shape when viewed from the side.|$|E
5|$|Grant has {{appeared}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States fifty-dollar bill since 1913. In 1921, the Ulysses S. Grant Centenary Association was founded {{with the goal}} of coordinating special observances and erecting monuments in recognition of Grant's historical role. The venture was financed by the minting of 10,000 gold dollars (depicted below) and 250,000 half dollars. The coins were minted and issued in 1922, commemorating the 100th anniversary of Grant's birth. Grant has also appeared on several U.S. postage stamps, the first one issued in 1890, five years after his death.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton's {{portrait}} {{has been}} featured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. $10 bill since 1928. The {{source of the}} engraving is John Trumbull's 1805 portrait of Hamilton, in the portrait collection of New York City Hall. In June 2015, the U.S. Treasury announced a decision to replace the engraving of Hamilton {{with that of a}} woman. Before the bill was actually redesigned, the decision was changed due to the unanticipated popular success of the 2015 Broadway musical Hamilton.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, Albert Michelson and Francis Pease {{mounted a}} 6-meter {{interferometer}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2.5-meter telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory. Helped by John Anderson, the trio measured the angular diameter of Betelgeuse at 0.047", a figure {{which resulted in}} a diameter of 3.84×108km (2.58 AU) based on the parallax value of 0.018". However, limb darkening and measurement errors resulted in uncertainty about the accuracy of these measurements.|$|E
5|$|In the United States {{green was}} {{connected}} with the dollar bill. Since 1861, the reverse side of the dollar bill has been green. Green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters, who tried to use early camera equipment to duplicate banknotes. Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle the pictures <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.|$|E

5|$|Nashville has honored two of {{its players}} by {{retiring}} their uniform numbers. When a number is retired, only the player with the retired number can wear that number if {{he returns to the}} team as a player or coach. This ensures that the number will be associated with one player of particular importance to the team. Nashville displays its retired numbers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> press box at First Tennessee Park.|$|E
5|$|New {{building}} techniques introduced {{with this}} set include a systematic way of building numbers. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building the year 1932 appears, {{which is a}} reference to when LEGO was founded.

5|$|Texas {{honored the}} Texas horned lizard in 1993, but private Texas Christian University {{has had the}} {{associated}} mascot the Horned Frog since 1896. According to legend, the football team identified with the lizards found on the practice field as the athletes and reptiles were similarly scrappy. The college founder's son, Addison Clark Jr., a faculty member and the initiator of the football team, had been fascinated by the creatures. By 1897, the lizard appeared as a logo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school yearbook, which Clark had also started and was managing.|$|E
