50|$|In 1905 Guerlain married Andrée Bouffet, a Protestant from Lille, {{and did so}} {{according}} to Protestant law, thereby suffering excommunication from the Catholic Church. Their first child, Jean-Jacques, was born the following year, as Guerlain finished Après lOndée (1906), his first major commercial success. This perfume, translated as “After the Rains” and described at its release as “melancholy” by La Liberté, was a continuation in Guerlain’s experiments with notes of heliotrope and violet. Due to affordable synthetics, this accord was popular in mainstream perfumery, though Guerlain’s treatment, incorporating anisic aldehyde, eugenol and large quantities of <b>orris</b> <b>root,</b> was considered exemplary by many, including perfumer Ernest Beaux.|$|E
50|$|According to the Beefeater website, Beefeater Gin {{contains}} {{nine different}} botanicals: juniper, angelica root, angelica seeds, coriander seeds, liquorice, almonds, <b>orris</b> <b>root,</b> seville oranges, and lemon peel.

This long process allows for a full extraction of flavour from the botanicals, capturing {{a wide range of}} volatile oils. The distillation itself takes around eight hours to complete, overseen by master distiller Desmond Payne - with the spirit then taken to Scotland where it is blended and bottled at 40% ABV.|$|E
50|$|The {{flavouring}} of {{the drink}} {{comes from a}} recipe of ten ingredients: almond, lemon peel, liquorice, juniper berries, <b>orris</b> <b>root,</b> angelica, coriander, cassia, cubeb, and grains of paradise. Alcohol bought in from another supplier is evaporated three times using a carterhead still, and the alcohol vapours are passed through a mesh/basket containing the ten botanicals, {{in order to gain}} flavour and aroma. This is felt to give the gin a lighter, more floral taste compared to those gins that are created using a copper pot still. Water from Lake Vyrnwy is added to bring the strength of Bombay Sapphire down to 40.0% (UK, Canada, Australia).|$|E
