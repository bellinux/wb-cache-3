After the 1830 revolution, the new King of the French Louis Philippe made Gazan a peer of France, and {{he received a}} command of a military division in Marseille. By this time, {{he was an old}} man, and in poor health, and he retired in June 1832. Gazan de la Peyriére died in Grasse on 9 April 1845.|$|E
5|$|In 405 AD, the Ostrogoths invaded Italy itself, {{but were}} defeated. However, in 406 AD an {{unprecedented}} number of tribes {{took advantage of}} the freezing of the Rhine to cross en masse: Vandals, Suevi, Alans and Burgundians swept across the river and met little resistance in the Sack of Moguntiacum and the Sack of Treviri, completely overrunning Gaul. Despite this grave danger, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> it, the Roman army continued to be wracked by usurpation, in one of which Stilicho, Rome's foremost defender of the period, was put to death.|$|E

25|$|The {{vicinity}} of Jacob Lake remained popular despite, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of,</b> its relative inaccessibility.

Bullock had several 'run ins' with Al Swearengen, proprietor of the notorious Gem Theater, Deadwood's most notable brothel.

25|$|Homosexuality in the United Kingdom was decriminalised in 1967, {{leading to}} a more liberal public attitude. There are many openly gay {{politicians}} and entertainers who remained elected and popular {{with little or no}} criticism or comment on their sexuality.

Despite this, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> this, rumours in the press, or joking between fans and players and even hostile homophobic abuse have been common within the game.|$|E
25|$|Despite, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of,</b> the {{pressure}} and stress put upon the young emperor, he despised learning {{for the majority of}} his life. According to Weng Tonghe's diary, the emperor could not read a memorandum in full sentences by the age of 16. Worried about her son's inability to learn, Cixi only pressured him more. When he was given personal rule at the age of 18, in November 1873 (four years behind the usual custom), the Tongzhi Emperor proved to be an incompetent ruler.|$|E

Indeed, when an impostor posing as Steve Jr. attempted to seduce Diana, she made it quite clear that she had no sexual interest in him. Executive producer Douglas S. Cramer noted the difficulties in maintaining long-term romantic tension between leads, because the resolution of that romantic tension often results in the cancellation of the series.|$|E

25|$|Ferdinand {{violated}} the 1491 Treaty of Granada peace treaty in 1502 by dismissing the clearly guaranteed religious freedom for Mudéjar Muslims. Ferdinand forced all Muslims in Castile and Aragon to convert, converso Moriscos, to Catholicism, or else be expelled. Some of the Muslims who remained were mudéjar artisans, who could {{design and build}} in the Moorish style. This was also practised by the Spanish inquisitors on the converso Marrano Jewish population of Spain. The main architect behind the Spanish Inquisition was King Ferdinand II, who was ironically of converso heritage (<b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> it, {{he may have been}} embittered by being the great-grandson of Fadrique's mistress).|$|E
25|$|Joseon {{was founded}} on Korean Confucianism, and these {{scholars}} of the time took a very dim view of professional women and of the kisaeng class in particular. There were many calls for {{the abolition of the}} kisaeng, or for their exclusion from court, but these were not successful—perhaps because of the influence of the women themselves, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> fear that officials would take to stealing the wives of other men. One such proposal was made during the reign of Sejong the Great, but when an advisor of the court suggested that the abolition of the class would lead to government officials committing grave crimes, the king chose to preserve the kisaeng.|$|E
25|$|Despite (<b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of)</b> his {{two years}} as a Socialist parliamentarian, Ben Gitlow professed a belief in revolutionary Socialism. From its {{earliest}} days in 1919, Ben Gitlow was an adherent of the proto-Communist Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party, working closely with renowned radical journalist and war correspondent John Reed. In April 1919, the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party of Local Greater New York established an official weekly newspaper called The New York Communist. Reed was named {{the editor of the}} new publication, with Maximilian Cohen handling the day-to-day operations of the publication as its business manager. Effective with the June 14, 1919, issue, Max Cohen exited the scene and Ben Gitlow assumed the post of business manager.|$|E
2500|$|Merleau-Ponty's {{critical}} {{position with}} respect to science was stated in his Preface to the Phenomenology— he described scientific points of view as [...] "always both naive {{and at the same}} time dishonest".

The first {{writing of}} the term would fairly easily be picked out as referring to sexual interactions, whereas the second term could just mean [...] "the customs of the southern part <b>of</b> China." [...] <b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> male sexual arousal is easier to spot where heavy clothing is not worn, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> simply <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the frequent use of this term, homosexuality came {{to be regarded as}} more common and accepted {{in the southern part of}} China.|$|R
5|$|After the Norman Conquest of 1066, {{the manor}} of Clevedon was {{granted by the}} King to Matthew de Mortagne, who in turn granted it to his sub-tenant, Hildebert. It is thought that Sir John was a {{descendant}} of either Matthew <b>or</b> Hildebert. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the distance to the}} parish church, the manor house included a chapel dedicated, in the 1320s, to Saint Peter. The house has undergone considerable change since it was built, almost every century seeing structural alterations, but it still retains many features of a mediaeval manor house.|$|R
25|$|Bismarck's {{conflict}} with the legislators intensified in the coming years. Following the Alvensleben Convention of 1863, the House of Deputies resolved that it could no longer {{come to terms with}} Bismarck; in response, the King dissolved the Diet, accusing it of trying to obtain unconstitutional control over the ministry—which, under the Constitution, was responsible solely to the king. Bismarck then issued an edict restricting the freedom of the press, an edict that even gained the public opposition of the Crown Prince. Despite (<b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of)</b> his attempts to silence critics, Bismarck remained a largely unpopular politician. His supporters fared poorly in the elections of October 1863, in which a liberal coalition, whose primary member was the Progress Party, won over two-thirds of the seats. The House made repeated calls for Bismarck to be dismissed, but the King supported him, fearing that if he did dismiss the Minister President, he would most likely be succeeded by a liberal.|$|E
25|$|Outside of Tibeto-Burman, {{one finds}} in Arunachal Pradesh a single {{representative}} of the Tai family, spoken by tribes like the Khampti and Singpho, which is closely affiliated to the Shan language of Myanmar's Shan State. Seemingly, Khampti is a recent arrival in Arunachal Pradesh whose presence dates to 18th and/or early 19th-century migrations from northern Myanmar. In addition to these non-Indo-European languages, the Indo-European languages Assamese, Bengali, English, Nepali and especially Hindi are making strong inroads into Arunachal Pradesh. Primarily {{as a result of}} the primary education system—in which classes are generally taught by Hindi-speaking immigrant teachers from Bihar and other Hindi-speaking parts of northern India, a large and growing section of the population now speaks a semi-creolized variety of Hindi as a mother tongue. Hindi acts as a lingua franca for most of the people in the state. Despite, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of,</b> the linguistic diversity of the region, English is the only official language recognised in the state.|$|E
25|$|Despite <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the Bitburg controversy, in 1985 a {{campaign}} had been started {{to build a}} memorial {{to the victims of}} the Holocaust in Berlin. It was felt by at least some Germans that there was something wrong about the Chancellor and the President of the United States honoring the memory of the SS men buried at Bitburg while there was no memorial to any of the people killed in the Holocaust. The campaign to build a Holocaust memorial, which Germany until then lacked, was given a major boost in November 1989 by the call by television journalist Lea Rosh to build the memorial at the site for the former Gestapo headquarters. In April 1992, the City of Berlin finally decided that a Holocaust memorial could be built. Along the same lines, in August 1987, protests put a stop to plans by the City of Frankfurt to raze the last remains of the Frankfurt Jewish Ghetto in order to redevelop the land, arguing that the remnants of the Frankfurt ghetto needed to be preserved.|$|E

500|$|In 1979, a Michigan State University student, James Dallas Egbert III, {{allegedly}} {{disappeared into}} the school's steam tunnels while playing a live-action version of D. In fact, Egbert was discovered in Louisiana several weeks later, but negative mainstream media attention focused on D as the cause. In 1982, Patricia Pulling's son killed himself. Blaming D for her son's suicide, Pulling formed an organization named B.A.D.D. (Bothered About Dungeons & Dragons) to attack {{the game and the}} company that produced it. Gygax defended the game on a segment of 60 Minutes, which aired in 1985. When death threats started arriving at the TSR office, Gygax hired a bodyguard.

In 1188 Gerald of Wales accompanied Baldwin of Forde, Archbishop of Canterbury, {{on a tour}} of Wales, the primary object being a recruitment campaign for the Third Crusade, a secondary one to establish his authority over the whole Welsh church. Gerald’s vivid account of the journey is the first great European travel book. Gerald visited Llanbadarn Fawr, and described the college of secular canons under a lay abbot (Ednowain [...] "bishop of Llanbadarn"), in not especially flattering terms; it should be remembered that Gerald was a zealous reformer, critical of anything of which he disapproved, as he did of Llanbadarn: the abbot was described as [...] "a certain old man, waxen old in iniquity". The account of his visit was subsequently published in the Itinerarium Cambriae (1191), and was followed by the Descriptio Cambriae in 1194.|$|E
500|$|Because The Thrill Book {{was only}} sold in {{selected}} {{parts of the}} US, copies of the magazine are very scarce and are highly prized by pulp magazine collectors. [...] Despite its rarity, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> it, it has been often described as the first science fiction and fantasy magazine ever published, though more recent assessments by science fiction and pulp historians agree instead that the magazine was a failed attempt at specialization. [...] In the words of Will Murray, the view that The Thrill Book is the first such magazine is [...] "erroneously held by many", and he adds that it was [...] "merely a prologue to the Golden Era of periodical weird fiction". [...] In Murray's opinion it might well have become a dominant force in the genre had it continued publication. [...] Richard Bleiler comments that [...] "it was a magazine that somehow became a symbol to a generation of pulp readers... {{it was the first}} eidetic flash of a dream that would later come into being with Weird Tales", and in Mike Ashley's opinion it was just [...] "a step towards a full-blown fantasy magazine".|$|E

Despite, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> even <b>because</b> <b>of,</b> this climate of instability, the Higashi Honganji movement has also produced a significant number of controversial but influential thinkers, such as Soga Ryōjin, Kiyozawa Manshi, Kaneko Daiei and Akegarasu Haya, amongst others.|$|R
