Accordingly, field experiments were conducted to determine the appropriate combination of application rates, placement method and C/N ratio of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> applied at transplanting time to increase rice yield and suppress paddy weed in organic rice cultivation. The treatment at the application rate of 10 gNm- 2 resulted insignificantly higher rice yield by 25 % than the treatment at the application rate of 5 gNm- 2. In addition, the application of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> to soil surface at the rate of 10 gNm- 2 increased rice yield by 31 - 45 % compared with the other treatments. The incorporation of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> into soil at a depth of 0 to 5 cm caused organic acids production that might damage rice roots, whereas they were little generated in the treatment applying the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> to soil surface. Furthermore, the application of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> of C/N = 8 produced significantly higher (+ 83 %) weed dry weight at the harvest time than that of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> of C/N= 16. Consequently, the application of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> of C/N= 16 at the rate of 10 gNm- 2 to soil surface increased rice yield by 35 % and reduced weed dry weight by 93 % as compared with the incorporation of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> of C/N= 8 into soil at the rate of 5 gNm- 2.

(1998) indicate that eradicant fungicide {{treatment of the}} seed and crop rotation with non-host crops can control spot blotch. In the rice-wheat system of South Asia, little {{work has been done}} on the epidemiology of HLB and how management of the rotation crops affects spot blotch and tan spot, except as noted earlier. More quantitative information is required on the role of alternate rotations, soil and plant nutrition, inoculum sources and climate. In the rice-wheat system, {{there is a need for}} timely planting of wheat, better stand establishment and root development, increased soil organic matter, sufficient levels of macro- and micronutrients, and water and weed management (Hobbs et al., 1996; Hobbs and Giri, 1997). Crop rotation and <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> will play a major role in HLB. This should favour beneficial soil organisms as well as better plant nutrition. In the rice-wheat system, it will be necessary to break the rotation with other crops to make it more sustainable, and this should help reduce disease problems in general. The use of oilseed rape in South Asia is common in mixture with wheat or in rotation. Since rape is known to have some fungitoxic effects upon decay, its effects on HLB would need research (Dubin and Duveiller, 2000). In the HLB complex, rotations would need to be sufficiently long to reduce the amount of soil inoculum. Cook and Veseth (1991) note that the kind of rotation crop may not be so important to root health as the length of time out of wheat. The rotation crops and length of rotation would have to be studied in relation to HLB.|$|E

Conclusively, soil and foliar Zn fertilization of maize in combination with <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> would be an adorable {{way to get the}} desired yield and Zn concentration in maize grains.|$|E
40|$|A {{long-term}} {{field experiment}} started in 1995 on Research Farm of Department of Soil Science, CCS Haryana Agricultural University Hisar (India) {{was selected to}} {{study the effects of}} <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> and chemical fertilizers on productivity, seed quality and nutrient use efficiency of wheat under pearl millet-wheat cropping system. The <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> (15 Mg FYM, 5 Mg poultry manure and 7. 5 Mg pressmud) were applied alone and in combination with fertilizers (150 kg N + 30 kg P 2 O 5 ha − 1) and compared with chemical fertilizers applied alone (150 kg N + 60 kg P 2 O 5 ha − 1 and 75 kg N + 30 kg P 2 O 5 ha − 1). The results showed that the application of <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> in combination with N and P fertilizers significantly increased all yield attributes, i. e. plant height, number of tillers/m row length, spike length, number of grains/spike. Higher grain yield of wheat (61. 4, 57. 4 and 62. 7 q ha − 1) was observed when recommended dose of N and half of P was applied in conjunction with FYM, poultry manure and pressmud, respectively. Grain yield of wheat increased by 13. 5, 6. 1 and 15. 9 %, respectively, under same treatments when compared with recommended dose of N and P fertilizers. Among the <b>organic</b> <b>manures,</b> highest yield (32. 9 q ha − 1) was obtained with pressmud application. However, application of <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> alone resulted in poor yield and even lower than 50 % recommended dose of N and P fertilizer. All the seed quality parameters (standard germination, shoot length, root length, seedling dry weight, seedling vigour index-I and -II) improved with the combined application of <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> and chemical fertilizers as compared to their individual application. The partial factor productivity of N and P increased with combined application <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> and chemical fertilizer as compared to chemical fertilizers applied alone, however, nutrient harvest index and their utilization efficiency decreased with combined application of <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> and fertilizers as compared to their individual application...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of organic mulches, <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> {{and renewable energy}} sources on the soil is effective in {{improving the quality of}} soil and increasing crop yield especially in organic farming. This paper discussed organic mulches, <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> and renewable energy sources for sustainable farming in agro-ecosystem. Organic mulches such as bark products, wood chips, deciduous tree leaves, mint compost, saw dust; <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> such as urine, poultry manure, bat guano, bone meat, fish meal and some renewable wastes such as biomass waste, plant wastes and human wastes have been identified. Besides controlling weeds, erosions, conserving moisture and sustaining soil productivity by improving physical and biological soil conditions and preventing degradation of the soil, they also serve as soil amendment and natural sources for subsequent crops upon mineralization and also help to attract earthworm. The use of organic mulches, <b>organic</b> <b>manures</b> and renewable energy sources is therefore recommended, considering the high cost of inorganic fertilizer, nutrient run- off and a number of health issues that result from agro chemical residue. Key words: organic mulches, <b>organic</b> <b>manures,</b> renewable energy sources, organic farming, sustainable farming, agro- ecosystem...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study impacts of <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> levels and {{inoculation}} with mycorrhiza fungi on growth, {{quantitative and qualitative}} yield of hyssop (Hyssopus officinalis L.), a field experiment was conducted as factorial based on a randomized complete block design with three replications at the Agricultural Research Station, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, during two growing seasons of 2009 - 2010 and 2010 - 2011. Mycorhiza inoculation (with and without inoculation) and five levels of <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> as decomposed cow manure (zero, 10, 20, 30 and 40 t. ha- 1) were considered as treatments. Plant height, canopy diameter, leaf to shoot ratio, shoot dry weight, essential oil content and essential oil yield of hyssop were measured and calculated accordingly. The {{results showed that the}} simple and interaction effects between <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> and mycorrhiza were significant (p≤ 0. 01) on plant height, canopy diameter, leaf to stem ratio, shoot dry weight and essential oil content and yield of hyssop. By increasing <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> level from zero to 30 t. ha- 1 enhanced shoot dry weight and essential oil yield of hyssop up to 127 and 43 %, respectively. Whereas by increasing <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> level up to 40 t. ha- 1 improved these traits up to 12 and 24 %, respectively. Mycorrhiza inoculation enhanced shoot dry weight and essential oil yield up to 19 and 14 %, respectively. The second year, growth of hyssop plants due to suitable establishment and more availability of nutrients were higher than the first year. <b>Organic</b> <b>manure</b> enhanced growth and yield of hyssop due to availability of nutrients and improvement in soil characteristics. Mycorrhiza inoculation promoted growth and yield of this valuable medicinal plant because of root development and nutrient availability particularly phosphorus...|$|R
