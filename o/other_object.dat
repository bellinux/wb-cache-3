5|$|Protective {{resemblance}} {{is used by}} prey {{to avoid}} predation. It includes special protective resemblance, now called mimesis, where the whole animal looks like some <b>other</b> <b>object,</b> for example when a caterpillar resembles a twig or a bird dropping. In general protective resemblance, now called crypsis, the animal's texture blends with the background, for example when a moth's colour and pattern blend in with tree bark.|$|E
5|$|The Kepler team's {{scientists}} conducted follow-up {{observations to}} confirm or reject the planetary nature of the detected object. To do so, they used the Keck 1 telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii; the Shane and Hale telescopes in California; telescopes at the WIYN (including MMT) and Whipple observatories in Arizona; Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands; the Hobby-Eberly and Harlan J. Smith telescopes in Texas; and NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. Because Kepler-11g orbits its star at a far greater distance than the inner five planets, fewer transits were observed, and radial velocity (the observation of a Doppler effect) interactions could not be easily discerned. As {{with the discovery of}} Kepler-9d, the Kepler team ran the information through numerous models to see if Kepler-11g's light curve could fit the profile of some <b>other</b> <b>object,</b> including an eclipsing binary star in the background that may have contaminated the data. The probability that Kepler-11g is not a planet but instead a false positive was determined to be 0.18%, effectively confirming its existence.|$|E

50|$|However, some {{concurrent}} {{objects are}} universal, {{which means they}} can solve consensus among any number of processes and they can simulate any <b>other</b> <b>objects.</b> The way to simulate <b>other</b> <b>objects</b> with universal objects is to build an operations sequence with this concurrent object.|$|R

25|$|Polynomials are {{frequently}} used to encode information about some <b>other</b> <b>object.</b> The {{characteristic polynomial of}} a matrix or linear operator contains information about the operator's eigenvalues. The minimal polynomial of an algebraic element records the simplest algebraic relation satisfied by that element. The chromatic polynomial of a graph counts the number of proper colourings of that graph.|$|E
25|$|The {{sound barrier}} or sonic barrier {{is a popular}} term for the sudden {{increase}} in aerodynamic drag and other effects experienced by an aircraft or <b>other</b> <b>object</b> when it approaches supersonic speed. When aircraft first began {{to be able to}} reach close to supersonic speed, these effects were seen as constituting a barrier making supersonic speed very difficult or impossible.|$|E

25|$|Between 1729 and 1736, two English scientists, Stephen Gray and Jean Desaguliers, {{performed}} {{a series of}} experiments which showed that a cork or <b>other</b> <b>object</b> {{as far away as}} 800 or 900 feet (245â€“275m) could be electrified by connecting it via a charged glass tube to materials such as metal wires or hempen string. They found that other materials, such as silk, would not convey the effect.|$|E
25|$|By 960 the Song Dynasty, {{short of}} copper for {{striking}} coins, issued the first generally circulating notes. A note is {{a promise to}} redeem later for some <b>other</b> <b>object</b> of value, usually specie. The issue of credit notes is often for a limited duration, and at some discount to the promised amount later. The jiaozi nevertheless did not replace coins during the Song Dynasty; paper money was used alongside the coins.|$|E

25|$|Mailbox {{baseball}} or mailboxing is an {{activity in which}} a baseball bat or <b>other</b> <b>object</b> is used to knock over, dent, or smash roadside mailboxes by a passenger in a car. It can be played either as a game, with score kept {{in a manner similar}} to baseball, or played simply for aimless fun.

25|$|Gender/ Sexuality- All of {{the major}} {{characters}} in the novel are female. The male characters that do exist are often portrayed as untrustworthy, or are using the female characters for money, sex, or some <b>other</b> <b>object.</b> Additionally, both Anna and Alyona are unrelentingly chastised by their mothers for their choices in partners. This creates a tension between {{the male and female}} characters, and often drives the male characters from the apartment, the main space of the novel.|$|E
25|$|A {{catastrophic failure}} is one which {{suddenly}} makes the vacuum tube unusable. A {{crack in the}} glass envelope will allow air into the tube and destroy it. Cracks may result from stress in the glass, bent pins or impacts; tube sockets must allow for thermal expansion, to prevent stress in the glass at the pins. Stress may accumulate if a metal shield or <b>other</b> <b>object</b> presses on the tube envelope and causes differential heating of the glass. Glass may also be damaged by high-voltage arcing.|$|E

25|$|His basic {{assumptions}} {{were very}} similar to those of Le Sage and Preston, but he gave a more detailed application of the kinetic theory. However, by asserting that the velocity of the corpuscles after collision was reduced without any corresponding increase in the energy of any <b>other</b> <b>object,</b> his model violated the conservation of energy. He noted that there is a connection between the weight of a body and its density (because any decrease in the density of an object reduces the internal shielding) so he went on to assert that warm bodies should be heavier than colder ones (related to the effect of thermal expansion).|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with Newton's first law of motion, an object moves {{in a straight}} line {{in the absence of any}} external forces acting on the object. A curved path may however ensue when a physical acts on it; this force is often called a centripetal force, as it is directed toward the center of curvature of the path. Then in {{accordance with}} Newton's third law of motion, there will also be an equal and opposite force exerted by the object on some <b>other</b> <b>object,</b> such as a constraint that forces the path to be curved, and this reaction force, the subject of this article, is sometimes called a reactive centrifugal force, as it is directed in the opposite direction of the centripetal force.|$|E

Should any player, coach, or non-playing person on the playersâ€™ bench or penalty bench throw anything on the ice during the progress of the game or during a stoppage of play, a bench minor penalty unsportsmanlike conduct shall be assessed. Can be upgraded to game misconduct or match penalty depending on severity.|$|E
