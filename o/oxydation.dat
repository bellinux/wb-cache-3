60|$|Section 12. Now the chemist {{tells us}} that when a stable body is formed, or when an {{unstable}} compound decomposes into simpler stable ones, force is evolved. The <b>oxydation</b> of carbon, for instance, in the fireplace, is {{the formation of the}} stable compound called carbon dioxide, and light and heat are evolved. The explosion of dynamite, again is the decomposition of an unstable compound. Hence, we begin to perceive that force-- the vital force-- which keeps the rabbit moving, is supplied by the decomposition and partial <b>oxydation</b> of compounds continued in its food, to carbon dioxide, water, urea, and smaller quantities of other substances.|$|E
60|$|Section 50. We {{have thus}} seen how the nutritive {{material}} is {{taken into the}} animal's system and distributed over its body, and incidentally, we have noted how the resultant products of the creature's activity are removed. The essence of the whole process, as we have already stated, is the decomposition and partial <b>oxydation</b> of certain complex chemical compounds to water, carbon dioxide, a low nitrogenous body, which finally {{takes the form of}} urea, and other substances. We may now go on to a more detailed study, the microscopic study, or histology, of the tissues in which metaboly and kataboly occur, but before we do this it will be convenient to glance for a moment at another of our animal types-- the Amoeba, the lowest as the rabbit is the highest, in our series.|$|E
60|$|With {{the ascent}} in power, the {{intensity}} of individuation keeps even pace; and from this we may explain all the characteristic distinctions between this class {{and that of the}} vermes. The almost homogeneous jelly of the animalcula infusoria became, by a vital <b>oxydation,</b> granular in the polypi. This granulation formed itself into distinct organs in the molluscæ; while for the snails, which are the next step, the animalized lime, that seemed the sole final cause {{of the life of the}} polypi, assumes all the characters of an ulterior purpose. Refined into a horn-like substance, it becomes to the snails the substitute of an organ, and their outward skeleton. Yet how much more manifold and definite, the organization of an insect, than that of the preceding class, the patient researches of Swammerdam and Lyonnet have evinced, to the delight and admiration of every reflecting mind.|$|E
60|$|Section 15. In an {{ordinary}} animal, locomotion and other activity predominate over nutritive processes, which fact we may express, {{in the terms}} just given, by saying that kataboly prevails over anaboly. An animal, as we have just explained, is an apparatus for the decomposition and partial <b>oxydation</b> of certain compounds, and these are obtained either directly or indirectly-- through other animals, {{in the case of}} meat-eaters-- from the vegetable kingdom. As the student will learn early in his botanical reading, the typical plant has, in its green colouring matter, chlorophyll, a trap to catch the radiating energy of the sun, and to accomplish, by the absorption of that energy, the synthesis (building up) of those organic compounds which the animal destroys. The typical plant is, on whole, passive and synthetic, or anabolic; the typical animal, active and katabolic; and the excess of kataboly over anaboly in the animal is compensated for by the anabolic work stored up, as it were, by the plant, which is, directly or indirectly, the animal's food.|$|E
