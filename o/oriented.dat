40|$|Attentional <b>orienting</b> {{involves}} two neuroanatomically and functionally separate components, the reflexive {{and voluntary}} attentional sub-systems, which interact to <b>orient</b> {{attention on the}} environment. Three experiments, in which a cueing paradigm was used, examined reflexive and voluntary <b>orienting</b> over later childhood development (i. e., 8 [...] 14 years old) in order to explore the mechanisms underlying {{the development of the}} control of attentional <b>orienting.</b> Experiments 1 and 2 explored whether reflexive and voluntary <b>orienting</b> develop in parallel, and examined the influence of cue predictability on attentional <b>orienting</b> during development. Experiment 3 explored the role of explicit instructions in the influence of cue predictability on voluntary and reflexive <b>orienting.</b> The results indicate that the development of attentional <b>orienting</b> over later childhood {{is a reflection of the}} operation of an underlying mechanism, general developmental changes in speed of processing. Apart from this mechanism, the efficiency of attentional <b>orienting</b> remains the same across age. In addition, the influence of cue predictability on attentional <b>orienting</b> reflects the operation of a low-level mechanism which operates independently of strategic influences; this mechanism may be covariance detection and judgment. The implications of these conclusions for modeling attentional <b>orienting,</b> and the development thereof, are considered...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{perceived}} eye gaze direction influences attentional <b>orienting.</b> However, it still remains unclear whether social <b>orienting</b> involves exogenous or endogenous attentional control. To address this issue, we examined if social <b>orienting</b> and endogenous <b>orienting</b> were differentially modulated by working memory load, which is known to interfere with endogenous but not exogenous attention. To do so, we manipulated eye direction as either spatially counterpredictive in Experiment 1 or spatially predictive in Experiment 2 while participants performed a cueing task either in isolation or under working memory load. We found that when social attention and endogenous attention diverged spatially in Experiment 1, social <b>orienting</b> elicited by gaze direction remained intact while endogenous <b>orienting</b> elicited by the cueâ€™s predictive meaning was suppressed under working memory load, suggesting independence between social <b>orienting</b> and endogenous <b>orienting...</b>|$|R

5|$|In the {{particular}} {{version of the}} experiment shown here, Hoek used a prism P to disperse light from a slit into a spectrum which passed through a collimator C before entering the apparatus. With the apparatus <b>oriented</b> parallel to the hypothetical aether wind, Hoek expected the light in one circuit to be retarded 7/600mm {{with respect to the}} other. Where this retardation represented an integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see constructive interference; where this retardation represented a half-integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see destructive interference. In the absence of dragging, his expectation was for the observed spectrum to be continuous with the apparatus <b>oriented</b> transversely to the aether wind, and to be banded with the apparatus <b>oriented</b> parallel to the aether wind. His actual experimental results were completely negative.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} (LCs) are {{matter in}} a state which has properties between those of conventional liquids and those of solid crystals. For instance, a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid, but its molecules may be <b>oriented</b> in a crystal-like way. There are {{many different types of}} liquid-crystal phases, which can be distinguished by their different optical properties (such as birefringence). When viewed under a microscope using a polarized light source, different liquid crystal phases will appear to have distinct textures. The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid-crystal molecules are <b>oriented</b> in different directions. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in a liquid-crystal phase (just as water may turn into ice or steam).|$|E
