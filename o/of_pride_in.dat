5|$|Corley instituted {{sweeping}} changes in {{leadership in the}} regiment, hoping to improve its combat performance. He was able {{to cut down on}} straggling to a degree with more strict threats of court martial, but this had a negative effect on the regiment's morale. He began a unit newspaper, eventually called Eagle Forward, and moved to allow more discourse for the soldiers and leaders of the unit, and this was shown to improve the morale to a degree. Wanting to build a sense <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> the unit, he sought to emphasize the toughness of the battles the regiment had seen, and played up its victory at the Battle of Yechon while downplaying other poor performances.|$|E
5|$|Stanford {{wrote of}} Bennett: He {{maintained}} his British characteristics throughout his life...The English take a kind <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> concealing {{their feelings and}} emotions, and this is reflected in their folk-song. The Thames has no rapids and no falls; it winds along under its woods in a gentle stream, never dry and never halting; it {{is the type of}} the spirit of English folkmusic... England is as remote from Keltic fire and agony, as the Thames is from the Spey. Bennett was a typical specimen of this English characteristic. He was a poet, but of the school of Wordsworth rather than of Byron and Shelley.|$|E
5|$|City have {{previously}} worn three other badges on their shirts, {{prior to their}} current badge which was implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the current badge, inside a circle bearing {{the name of the}} club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced {{the lower half of the}} shield with the red rose of Lancashire. On occasions when Manchester City plays in a major cup final, the usual badge has not been used; instead shirts bearing a badge of the arms of the City of Manchester are used, as a symbol <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> representing the city of Manchester at a major event. This practice originates from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind, but has continued throughout the history of the club. For the 2011 FA Cup Final, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.|$|E
3000|$|Comparing the {{indirect}} effects via affective organizational commitment on proactivity {{with the effects}} <b>of</b> organizational <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> employees’ efforts when not including affective organizational commitment in the regression, shows for individual and team proactivity that {{the indirect}} effect via affective organizational commitment indeed partially mediated the effects <b>of</b> organizational <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> employees’ efforts.

For organizational proactivity the effect <b>of</b> organizational <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> employees’ efforts was significantly positive when not including affective organizational commitment (β = [...]. 12, p < [...]. 01). As {{it was no longer}} significant when including affective organizational commitment in the regression, affective organizational commitment fully mediated the effect <b>of</b> organizational <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> employees’ efforts on organizational proactivity.

25|$|Aung San's {{name had}} been invoked by {{successive}} Burmese governments since independence, until the military regime in the 1990s tried to eradicate all traces of Aung San's memory. Nevertheless, several statues of him adorn the former capital Yangon and his portrait still has a place <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> many homes and offices throughout the country. Scott Market, Yangon's most famous, was renamed Bogyoke Market in his memory, and Commissioner Road was retitled Bogyoke Aung San Road after independence. These names have been retained. Many towns and cities in Burma have thoroughfares and parks named after him. His portrait was held up across the nation during the 8888 Uprising in 1988 and used as a rallying point. Following the 8888 Uprising, the government redesigned the national currency, the kyat, removing his picture {{and replacing it with}} scenes of Burmese life.|$|E

His family owned a shortwave radio which received music broadcasts from around the world, exposing him at an early age to world music. Early in childhood he recognized the stark differences between the popular music of his day and the music that was played in his home. He also became interested in jazz, enjoying the works of musicians such as Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk and Milt Jackson. His parents came of age during the Harlem Renaissance, instilling in their son a sense <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> his Caribbean and African ancestry through their stories.|$|E

500|$|While {{starting}} for {{an injured}} John David Booty in 2007, Sanchez wore a custom mouthguard that featured {{the colors of}} the Mexican flag in honor of his heritage. It became a prominent issue after a nationally televised game against Notre Dame. The mouthpiece became a symbol for two opposing viewpoints: for Mexican-Americans, it was a symbol of unity—Sanchez accepting his heritage; for critics, the gesture symbolized a radical political statement. Sanchez, who {{was born and raised in}} the United States, received hate mail urging him to return to Mexico. Sanchez responded to the controversy stating, [...] "It’s not a Mexican power thing or anything like that. It’s just a little bit <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> our heritage.

500|$|At the story's climax, Gawain is wounded superficially in {{the neck}} by the Green Knight's axe. During the medieval period, {{the body and the}} soul were {{believed}} to be so intimately connected that wounds were considered an outward sign of inward sin. The neck, specifically, was believed to correlate with the part of the soul related to will, connecting the reasoning part (the head) and the courageous part (the heart). Gawain's sin resulted from using his will to separate reasoning from courage. By accepting the girdle from the lady, he employs reason to do something less than courageous—evade death in a dishonest way. Gawain's wound is thus an outward sign of an internal wound. The Green Knight's series of tests shows Gawain the weakness that has been in him all along: the desire to use his will pridefully for personal gain, rather than submitting his will in humility to God. The Green Knight, by engaging with the greatest knight of Camelot, also reveals the moral weakness <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> all of Camelot, and therefore all of humanity. However, the wounds of Christ, believed to offer healing to wounded souls and bodies, are mentioned throughout the poem in the hope that this sin of prideful [...] "stiffneckedness" [...] will be healed among fallen mortals.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{desertion}} problem, the Battalion's strict {{discipline and}} drilling began {{to bring the}} men into line. [...] "The awakening of a sense <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> their training and confidence in themselves was becoming apparent," [...] Alexandre Binda writes. Around this time the regimental march was chosen, as Binda says, [...] "rather by accident than design". One of the instructors seconded from Britain, Scottish Lance-Corporal Mac Martin, developed a habit of accompanying the men's route marching with appropriate songs, played on his bagpipes. An American gospel song, When the Saints Go Marching In, became a favourite among the soldiers, {{and when it was}} omitted during a retreat ceremony in Bulawayo soon after the Battalion's formation, a representative of the men complained to the Regimental Sergeant Major Ron Reid-Daly, asking why [...] "our regimental march" [...] was not played. Reid-Daly replied simply that there was no regimental march, prompting the representative to declare the song as such to him. Angered not only by his charges' impudence in choosing a march for themselves, but also because he believed that their preferred tune was [...] "unimaginative", Reid-Daly consulted the Regiment's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel J. S. Salt. To Reid-Daly's surprise, Salt sanctioned the troopers' choice, saying [...] "I rather like The Saints." [...] Soon afterwards, the Lieutenant-Colonel arranged for his battalion to be presented with a pair of a cheetah cubs as regimental mascots.|$|E
500|$|Evans {{retired as}} CAS on 30May 1985, having flown {{in excess of}} 8,600 hours during his RAAF career. [...] He was praised by his successor, Air Marshal Jake Newham, for his [...] "extraordinary zeal and robustness" [...] that helped instil [...] "a renewed sense <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> the Service". In {{retirement}} Evans became a consultant on defence and aviation matters, and wrote and lectured extensively on air power. As a visiting fellow at the Australian National University's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre in 1986, he produced a working paper focussing on the RAAF's concept of operations, Air Operations in Northern Australia. The same year, he was publicly critical of the Federal government's Dibb Report, claiming that while it contained [...] "sensible policy for the defence of Australia", it did not recognise the ADF's offensive capabilities: [...] "People win wars by taking the initiative. In war the aim must be to win.... If you are a small force you cannot afford to wait, and otherwise you will be defeated." [...] Evans also stood for political office, running as the Liberal candidate for the seat of Eden-Monaro, New South Wales, in the 1987 Australian federal election. He was competing for the conservative vote with National candidate Peter Cochran, whose party advertising was considered to have outperformed the Liberals'. [...] The seat was retained by incumbent Labor member Jim Snow.|$|E
