50|$|Although {{the area}} under cotton {{cultivation}} has declined {{since the early}} 1960s, yields have increased {{as a result of}} improved varieties of seed and increasing amounts of fertilizer. The area planted dropped from over 250,000 hectares in the early 1960s to 140,000 hectares in 1980. In response to the jump in procurement prices by 1984, it increased to 178,000 hectares. As domestic consumption of cotton increased in the 1960s and 1970s, the government built several textile mills to gain the value added from exports of fabrics and clothes compared with exports of raw cotton. In the 1980s, cotton exports averaged 120,000 tons, ranging from a low of 72,800 tons to a record of 151,000 tons in 1983. Syria's seed cotton harvest was 462,000 tons in 1985, about 3 percent higher than in 1984. Approximately 110,000 tons of the 1985 harvest were destined for export markets. Major foreign customers in 1985 included the Soviet Union (18,000 tons), Algeria (14,672 tons), Italy (13,813 tons), and Spain (10,655 tons).The government's goal of expanding and diversifying food production created intense competition for irrigated land and encouraged the practice of double cropping. Because cotton did not lend itself to double cropping, the cultivated cotton area was declining in real terms. However, the area under cultivation and significance of <b>other</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>crops</b> substantially increased during the 1980s. For example, the government initiated policies designed to stimulate sugar beet cultivation to supply the sugar factories built in the 1970s and 1980s. The area under cultivation for sugar beets rose from 22,000 hectares in 1980 to 35,700 hectares in 1984, with sugar beet harvests totaling over 1 million tons in 1984. Syria, however, still imported LS287 million worth of sugar in 1984. USDA estimated that Syria would achieve tobacco self-sufficiency in 1985, with harvests of 12.3 million tons (dry weight) compared with 12.2 million tons in 1984. Although yields per hectare fell slightly in 1985, USDA expected imports to match exports. In 1984 Syria imported 559 tons of tobacco and exported 225 tons. Other important commercial crops included olives and tomatoes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first issue}} {{was that the}} Albanian lek became revalued {{in terms of the}} Yugoslav dinar as a customs union was formed and Albania's {{economic}} plan was decided more by Yugoslavia. Albanian economists H. Banja and V. Toçi stated that the relationship between Albania and Yugoslavia during this period was exploitative and that it constituted attempts by Yugoslavia to make the Albanian economy an [...] "appendage" [...] to the Yugoslav economy. Hoxha then began to accuse Yugoslavia of misconduct: We Albania were expected to produce for the Yugoslavs all the raw materials which they needed. These raw materials were to be exported to the metropolitan Yugoslavia to be processed there in Yugoslav factories. The same applied to the production of cotton and <b>other</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>crops,</b> as well as oil, bitumen, asphalt, chrome, etc. Yugoslavia would supply its 'colony', Albania, with exorbitantly priced consumer goods, including even items such as needles and thread, and would provide us with petrol and oil, as well as glass for the lamps in which we burn the fuel extracted from our subsoil, processed in Yugoslavia and sold to us at high prices ... The aim of the Yugoslavs was, therefore, to prevent our country from developing either its industry or its working class, and to make it forever dependent on Yugoslavia. Joseph Stalin advised Hoxha that Yugoslavia was attempting to annex Albania: [...] "We did not know that the Yugoslavs, under the pretext of 'defending' your country against an attack from the Greek fascists, wanted to bring units of their army into the PRA Republic of Albania. They tried to do this in a very secretive manner. In reality, their aim in this direction was utterly hostile, for they intended to overturn the situation in Albania." [...] By June 1947, the Central Committee of Yugoslavia began publicly condemning Hoxha, accusing him of talking an individualistic and anti-Marxist line. When Albania responded by making agreements with the Soviet Union to purchase a supply of agricultural machinery, Yugoslavia said that Albania could not enter into any agreements with other countries without Yugoslav approval.|$|E
40|$|In just twelve years' {{time the}} world will require levels of {{agricultural}} production some 60 % greater than the harvest of 1980. Many people pin their hopes of meeting this spiralling demand on modern technology and, in particular, on genetic engineering. At the same time, many ex perts are becoming increasingly concerned that the options for the future are being narrowed by the erosion {{of one of our}} most important heritages, the genetic diversity of our crop plants and their wild relations. In depleting these resources, the experts fear that we are destroying the very raw materials so important in future genetic improvements. Gene Banks and the World's Food addresses this problem directly and has been written by four leading authorities on the subject. The book looks in some detail at a number of cases of crop failure directly attributable to genetic simplification - a problem that has occured {{in many areas of the}} world and has affected food, beverage and <b>other</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>crops.</b> Other sections of the book outline the history of germplasm preservation and exchange and give an up-todate report on the status and locations of gene banks, also listing the current germplasm holding by crop. Examples are also given of how these reserves are being used to develop better crop varieties for the benefit of people around the world. Market requirements can also reduce diversity, modern grain processing demanding homogenous samples in large quantities to suit the latest requirements of milling and baking, malting and brewing, in the case of wheat and barley and similar constraints apply in the processing of beverages, vegetable oils and fruit for canning and freezing. With its readable, wide-ranging and authoritative approach, Gene Banks and the World's Food, presents a forceful warning of the hazards that may be ahead, alongside a more positive summary of the enormous potential for the future if gene banks are given the prominence and support they deserve. It is valuable reading for all those involved in meeting the demand on agriculture towards the end of the century. Plucknett, D Letal., 1987. Gene Banks and the World s Food.

40|$|Vegetable {{oil crop}} {{production}} has increased faster than <b>other</b> food or <b>industrial</b> <b>crops</b> in recent years. Palm oil which is widely grown in tropical areas {{has become the}} most internationally produced and traded oil with a detrimental effect on the natural environment and the sustainability of producing communities.

Pal production practices have elicited negative Environmental Concern Values regarding the availability of resources for future generations. Environmental consciousness seems to be an important attribute marketers should take into account when both developing and promoting products. However, consumers’ perception of palm oil as a product ingredient was regarded as minimal.

40|$|Cropping pattern {{refers to}} the {{percentage}} of acreage occupied by various crops within the crop rotation. It is determined through cultivated' area assigned to each crop according to the sequence system necessitated by crop rotation considerations. The optimum crop pattern is the one, which achieves the highest possible net return depending on input and output prices together with crop yields. It is a dynamic process as it changes from time to another based on farmers' needs and crops profitability in the previous year. It also may differ based on whether we are looking {{from the point of}} view individual farmer, trader, middleman, and exporter or {{from the point of view}} the society as a whole. Various crops are competing on the limited land within the agricultural season. So expanding the acreage of any crop would automatically entail contraction of another competitive crop, as total supply of land is almost fixed and limited. The major objective behind designing an indicative cropping pattern is the issue of food security. This issue is important both from strategic perspective, as well as in the context of poverty. While there is emerging consensus on the definition of food security as aiming to assure the country adequate access to food, both internally and externally generated, there is still reference to the need to grow certain strategic crops. Moreover, there is a desire to achieve a measure of stabilization in producer and consumer prices through the development of buffer stocks. There are various options available, each of which has costs and benefits related to them. One option would be a high level of risk aversion, which would entail a cropping pattern that centers on subsistence crops. Another option may pursue efficiency pricing and therefore would result in crops being growing in which the country has a comparative advantage. For example, self-sufficiency for wheat could be enhanced to 75 % in an efficient manner. Meanwhile the domestic production of rice and sugar cane may expand to a frontier that misallocates resources of water and land. The agricultural production is very susceptible to risks originated from natural, economic or social fosters that are difficult to predict or control. In Egypt, cropping pattern, is influenced by local economic variables to up prices, i. e., cropped area is determined by farmer response to changes in absolute or relative prices of the preceding season, in addition to profitability of crops of the last season, where farmer can not change supply of labor, the elapse of period of time curding to the nature of the crops being produced. Egypt's cropping pattern is also affected by international variables related to transactions with international markets for food products and to transactions with international markets for food products and to problem related to world production of biological fuel, world financial crisis, world food crisis, and rules imposed by the international trade system. As a result, there is a deficit in the Egyptian balance of trade for food commodities amounting to L. E. 8 milliards on average for the last few years. The upsurge in demand for agricultural crops like wheat, maize, soybeans, vegetable, oils, and sugar crops for the use in producing biological fuel has resulted in a drastic increase in prices of food, during 2005 - 2007 the average rate of price increase of food commodities has been estimated at 83 % which led to a high increase in import bill in developing -and poor countries among them Egypt which is a not food importer. For many reasons developing an increase in domestic agricultural production of strategic food crops, i. e., cereals legumes. Vegetable, oils, and sugar crops, is the best way to confront international variables, Either through vertical or horizontal expansion of those crops in addition to reducing the acreage of high water consuming scraps, which is the objective behind suggesting the cropping pattern in the short and long terms. Each of these objectives is direct by associated with the master end of ensuring food serenity. Indicative cropping pattern during last years varies considerably as compared to the actual cropping pattern experienced by farmers' decisions irrespective of the agricultural policy of the government Egypt. However, indicative or proposed cropping pattern could be put into action by introducing economic, institution and organization instruments. Those various instruments should be streamlined and harmonized together. Economic instruments advisable for execution of cropping pattern could include subsidizing production and inputs for strategic export and import crops that minimize consumption of irrigation water, introducing contractual agricultural production system, especially, in regard to cotton, sugar cane and sugar beet in addition to <b>other</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>crops.</b> It is advisable to establish agricultural stabilization funds to insure' farmers against various types of risks notably price risks. More over incentives either negative like taxes or positive like interest rate reduction, and rescheduling of debts could also be provided and operated. One major organizational instrument that has been successful recently introduced at a probation scale in three governorates is the national project for development of the field irrigation system in wade and delta. It is estimated that application of that project would save 15 % of water consumed for irrigation. The saved water could be used for ameliorating and reclaiming an estimated acreage of 3 million feddans. In addition it is suggested that elimination of camels and messages on the fields would save and area of 0. 5 million feddans to be put under cultivation. The study has estimated risk associated with Egyptian cropping pattern by application of linear and non-linear mathematical programming. Three models of minimization risk have been proposed and manipulated including: (1) Minimization Of Total Absolute Deviations: (MOTAD). (2) Risk Input-Output MOTAD. (3) Two Stage Stochastic Programming – (TSSP-RIO-MOTAD). In addition to the various scenarios cited above with their respective major objective functions, the models do comprise acreage, means of production in terms of cost of production, monthly year round irrigation water, and annual agricultural labor on monthly basis. Sensitivity analysis has been estimated for depicting the effect of changing prices of wheat and rice on cropping pattern disposition, by the application of TSSP-RIO-MOTAD model. Among the major results of these analyses are: 1 - An increment of gross margin to farmers at L. E 3. 8 milliard which deeps that suggested cropping has achieved the profit maximization goal which producers would aim at. 2 - A huge amount of irrigation water has been saved estimated at 2. 6 milliard cubic meters. A magnitude of water saved of this amount could be assigned for reclaiming new lands at about 0. 7 million feddans. 3 - Capital resources saved estimated at L. E. 985 million. 4 - Augmenting acreage under wheat to reach as much as 3 million feddans, which help contributing positives to the nation's food security goal. 5 - Reduction in rice acreage so as not to exceed one million feddan. Adding to the nations objectives of saving irrigation water to be used for reclamation of additional new lands. 6 - Augmenting acreage cultivated to Soya beans, sunflower, maize, and summer sorghum at 84. 9 %, 69. 5 %, 41 %, and 12. 3 % respectively, which, once again, contributes to the nation's objective related to enhancing food security. 7 - Augmenting areas under lentil, lupine, chickpeas, broad bean, and fenugreek by 111 %, 62. 2 %, 39. 5 %, 19. 8 %, and 8. 6 % respectively, which positively adds to food security objective. The proposed cropping pattern derived through sensitivity analysis and based on varying farm- prices for wheat and rice is heavily dependent on the effectiveness and synergy of mechanisms and instruments suggested for addressing and implementing of the indicative cropping pattern. Securing the accomplishment of maximization of farmer's profit margin are very major and essential objectives of the proposed cropping pattern. ...|$|E
