5|$|The Oklahoma panhandle's Western edge is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>alignment</b> {{with its}} Texas border. The Oklahoma/New Mexico border is 2.1 to 2.2 {{miles east of}} the Texas line. The border between Texas and New Mexico was set first {{as a result of a}} survey by Spain in 1819. It was then set along the 103rd Meridian. In the 1890s, when Oklahoma was {{formally}} surveyed using more accurate surveying equipment and techniques, it was discovered the Texas line was not set along the 103rd Meridian. Surveying techniques were not as accurate in 1819, and the actual 103rd Meridian was approximately 2.2 miles to the east. It was much easier to leave the mistake than for Texas to cede land to New Mexico to correct the surveying error. The placement of the Oklahoma/New Mexico border represents the true 103rd Meridian.|$|E
5|$|When {{the plant}} was started up for testing on {{schedule}} in November, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>alignment</b> because {{of the power of}} the magnets and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December, Groves ordered a magnet broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings. The second Alpha I was not operational until the end of January 1944; the first Beta and first and third Alpha I's came online in March, and the fourth Alpha I became operational in April. The four Alpha II racetracks were completed between July and October 1944.|$|E

She took on several major projects, including designing the landscape of the University of Delaware campus in 1919 at the recommendation of Sharp, who chaired the college's Buildings and Grounds Committee. From 1918 to 1952, Coffin was appointed the University of Delaware’s landscape architect, a position which required Coffin to unite the university’s two separate campuses (the former Delaware College to the north and the Delaware Women’s College to the south) into one cohesive design. This was a challenge since the linear mall design of each was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>alignment</b> with the other. Coffin solved this problem by linking them via a circle instead of curving the straight paths (the university’s library faces this circle today) which rendered the misalignment unnoticeable to the pedestrian.|$|E

In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II.

25|$|The {{pivoting}} {{part that}} supports the cylinder is called the crane; it is the weak point of swing-out cylinder designs.

Lack of alignment between chamber and barrel is a dangerous condition, as it can impede the bullet's transition from chamber to barrel.

Today's hostility to Jews as Jews is based on the Arab–Israeli conflict, not on ancient European fantasies. Israel proclaims itself as the state of the Jewish people, and many Jews align themselves with Israel for that very reason. It is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this <b>alignment</b> that the hostility to Jews as Jews arises, rather than hostility to Israelis or to Zionists.

25|$|Other {{distinctive}} {{traits are}} related to the tusk whorls on the lower jaw. Because they could rotate, this was a different method of jaw articulation which did not compare with primitive ray-finned fish. The lower jaw was entirely articulated with cartilage, without an intermediate structure between the opposite sides, allowing the separation of the bones when prey was struck. Moreover, the loose articulation caused lateral movement, making the tusk walls move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>alignment.</b> The parts of the lower jaw would have rotated inwards upon closing in order for the tusk whorls to fit exactly into the hollow spaces in the upper jaw. It is suggested that a ligament attachment and retractor mechanism existed in a pit under the tusk whorl, a unique condition in vertebrates. The capacity of the teeth on the lower jaw to fit with the tooth rows in the upper jaw, upon closure, kept the tusk whorls in place.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{tracking}} {{of the blade}} is crucial to accurate cutting and considerably reduces blade breakage. The first step to ensuring good tracking is to check that the two bandwheels or flywheels are co-planar. This {{can be done by}} placing a straightedge across the front of the wheels and adjusting until each wheel touches. Rotate the wheels with the blade in position and properly tensioned and check that the tracking is correct. Now install the blade guide rollers and leave a gap of about 1 mm between the back of the blade and the guide flange. The teeth of blades that have become narrow through repeated sharpening will foul the front edge of the guide rollers due to their kerf set and force the blade <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>alignment.</b> This can be remedied by cutting of a small step on the rollers' front edges to accommodate the protruding teeth. Ideally the rollers should be crowned, (see belt_and_pulley_systems) a configuration that assists in the proper {{tracking of}} bands and belts, at the same time allowing clearance for the set of the teeth.|$|E
25|$|The SG 550 is a selective-fire 5.56×45mm NATO {{assault rifle}} firing from a closed bolt. It has a gas-actuated piston-driven {{long-stroke}} operating system {{derived from the}} SIG SG 540 series of rifles, which uses burnt powder gases vented through a port in the barrel to power the weapon's moving parts. Once inside the gas cylinder, propellant gases pass through an L-shaped channel machined in the piston head and are directed forward towards the gas valve. The pressure build-up {{in front of the}} piston head pushes the piston and bolt carrier rearward. As the piston is driven back, the gas port and the L-shaped channel move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>alignment,</b> cutting off the supply of gas to the cylinder. Surplus gas and powder residues are evacuated through an exhaust port in the gas cylinder. This system ensures that only the precise volume of gas required to overcome the mass and resistance of the rifle's moving assembly is admitted from the barrel. The manually adjustable gas valve has two settings, one for normal operation, and the second setting for use in the presence of heavy fouling or icing.|$|E
