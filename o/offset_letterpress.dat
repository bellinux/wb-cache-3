Invented in 1844 by Charles Fenerty of Nova Scotia, Canada, it usually has an off white cast and distinctive feel. It is designed for use in printing presses that employ a long web of paper (web <b>offset,</b> <b>letterpress</b> and flexographic) rather than individual sheets of paper.|$|E

50|$|Because it is {{not made}} from fibers, Stone Paper {{possesses}} a smoother surface than most traditional paper products, obviating {{the need for a}} coating or lamination. The source of the calcium carbonate is waste material collected from marble quarries and offcuts which are ground and reduced to fine white calcium carbonate powder. The production of Stone Paper uses no water, acid and no bleach or optical brighteners. Stone Paper is compatible with inkjet or solid ink printers e.g. <b>Offset,</b> <b>Letterpress,</b> gravure, flexographic, but does not respond well to very high temperature laser printers.|$|E

Even the least technically minded teachers, professors, clergy, and self-publishers could make use of them. The machines owed most of their popularity to this relative ease of use, and in some cases, to their lack of a requirement for an external power source.|$|R

As the invitation wording and design hint the wedding style, {{in the same manner}} the printing technique chosen will conveys how formal the whole wedding ceremony is. The type printing technique selected will also have a big impact on the wedding budget, and it will help in choosing the design and paper type. With the availability of high standard printing techniques, Hindu invitations can be printed by diverse methods like flocking, embossing, hot foil stamping, laser cuttings, raised silk screen printing, <b>offset</b> Printing, <b>Letterpress,</b> Thermography, Engraved Wedding Invitations and many more to give a new multidimensional look to Hindu invitation cards. So it all depends on what kind of look is desired and what is the allocated budget for it.|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} the {{printing}} industry, specifically sheetfed <b>offset</b> and <b>letterpress</b> printers, have {{been dealing with}} the problem of chemical ghosting. Traditionally it has been, a problem associated with drying oil inks. More recent research concludes that ghosting is also affected by the permeability of an adjacent substrate. This thesis examines paper coating constituents, their degree of concentration, and what influence they play- with regards to ghosting. A quickset drying oil ink has been found which when subjected to the proper laboratory conditions will display a high degree of colored ghosting. The thesis indicates the method of creating ghosting and a method of measurement. A procedure for making paper samples with various percentages of coating constituents is outlined. Experimentation has shown ghosting to be affected by the absorbency and ink hold out of the paper coating. This effect is increased at low absorption levels but diminishes as absorption is increased. In addition, comprehensive background information is included to assist the reader to become more enlightened to the true nature of this problem. The list of subjects surveyed include the definition of ghosting, the mechanisms involved, associated variables, and a summary of all pertinent literature...|$|R
50|$|The set of {{procedures}} used {{in any particular}} prepress environment {{is known as a}} workflow. Workflows vary, depending on the printing process (e.g., <b>letterpress,</b> <b>offset,</b> digital printing, screen printing), the final product (books, newspapers, product packaging), and the implementation of specific prepress technologies. For example, {{it is not uncommon to}} use a computer and image-setter to generate film which is then stripped and used to expose the plate in a vacuum frame; this workflow is hybrid because separation and halftoning are carried out via digital processes while the exposure of the plate is an analog one. That demonstrates that the borders around the prepress are very fluid. Furthermore, - depending on the printing method and the print product - the elements of the prepress of a graphic print production can differ from case to case. This circumstance requires a management of the workflow. It is necessary to manage the responsibility for each part of the workflow. That can mean that employees, who are actually responsible for other parts of the production (e.g. Layout), have to attend to parts of the prepress.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the move to <b>offset</b> {{printing}} from <b>letterpress</b> in the U. S. daily newspaper publishing industry was determined, in part, by {{the structure of the}} local market. Although in monopoly markets, low circulation papers were quicker to adopt than high circulation papers, the ranking was reversed within duopoly markets. In such markets, the smaller firm is predicted to adopt four years later than the larger one did. This result is partially consistent with preemption models of adoption. Hazard analysis further shows that in markets in which one firm has exited, the remaining duopolist is less likely to adopt than otherwise, consistent with preemption, and at odds with a declining industry explanation. Further analysis shows that adoption was determined, at least in part, at the firm rather than the newspaper, level, although, on the whole, newspaper chains adopted neither earlier nor later than non-chain newspapers. Ceteris paribus, adoption occurred more quickly in non-industrial states. Special thanks are due to production managers and executives at the Boston Globe for discussions and a tour of the plant.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityStatement {{of problem}} - It is {{commonly}} agreed upon in educational circles that professional growth {{is an essential}} factor {{to the development of}} sound and efficient teaching. Among the several state and regional associations of mathematics teachers, mathematics newsletters or bulletins maintain a place of importance as professional aids in that they serve as a major means of communications between the professional group and the individual teachers. Despite the fact that more than twenty associations of mathematics teachers publish a newsletter or bulletin of some type, relatively little attention has been given to this area of activity. Except for occasional material in The Mathematics Teacher, no detailed study of mathematics newsletters is available. It is the intent of this project to analyze and summarize the status of mathematics newsletters as they exist today. The survey is primarily of a quantitative nature without particular reference to qualitative ratings of the newsletters individually or as a group. Three important aspects of any journal or bulletin are its purposes, its content, and its means of publication. It is to these three areas that the major portion of this thesis is confined. The analysis of the mathematics newsletters with respect to their purposes, content, and means of publication was conducted from three significantly different points of view - the author's, that of the editors of the newsletters, and that of the readers of the newsletters. Author's analysis - Newsletters were obtained from twenty different associations for use in this study. Only regularly published newsletters directly related to a professional organization were utilized, thereby excluding student journals or special communications not regularly a part of the sponsoring organization's program. Copies of the available newsletters were examined to determine the types of articles included, the percentage of space devoted to each major classification, and the essential physical features of the publications. A wide range of articles was found in the various newsletters, and twenty-one principal types were drawn up as covering the entire gamut. News of the activities of the sponsoring organization and articles on methods of teaching were found to be the two types most frequently encountered in the newsletters. Everyone of the twenty newsletters examined contained news of its sponsoring organization with the percentage of space devoted to this type of article varying from eleven percent to ninety-five percent of the total space in a newsletter. The variation found in the styles of the newsletters was as marked as the difference in the types of articles used. The dimensions of the newsletters ranged from 6 X 9 inches to 8 1 / 2 X 14 inches, with 8 1 / 2 X 11 inches the most popular size. The least number of pages in any of the newsletters was two, and the greatest number of pages was thirty-two. Only four of the associations used covers for their newsletters and in only six cases was any color used. Three methods of printing were found to be utilized among the newsletters with stencil the most common method. <b>Offset</b> and <b>letterpress</b> were the two other styles of printing. Editors' evaluations - A questionnaire seeking pertinent information about his publication was sent to each editor of a newsletter, snd seventeen replies were received. The editors agreed that a wide range of articles would be desirable in their newsletters, but noted that in any single publication such a wide spread of material was not to be found. As expected, news of activities of the sponsoring organization was given as the most frequently used item. With respect to the purposes of their newsletters, the editors felt that they were operating on specific, well-defined objectives, and that their efforts were being justified. The most often mentioned objective was that of providing reports on the work of the sponsoring organization, an objective which is borne out in the previously reported content of the publications. Publication data received from the editors revealed that average circulation per issue varied from 100 to 1000 with 300 as a median figure. The frequency of publication ranged from one to four issues per year with two issues being the most common practice. The median cost per issue of the newsletters surveyed was thirty dollars. The editors stated that the major difficulty experienced in their work was apathy on the part of teachers, while financial restrictions were also frequently mentioned as troublesome. Readers' evaluations - Questionnaires similar to those used in questioning the editors were sent to a small sample of readers of each of fourteen newsletters for which readers' names were available. Every one of thirteen suggested types of articles was considered worthwhile by a large majority of the readers who were polled. Announcements about workshops and conferences, reports of activities of the sponsoring organization, end news about teaching aids were the most frequently supported categories. From these results it is evident that the readers, like the editors, were virtually unanimous in the belief that news directly related to the activities of the parent organization deserved primary attention in the newsletters. When asked for their reactions to their newsletters, approximately two-thirds of the readers stated that they read the publications thoroughly, and a somewhat smaller percentage indicated that they considered the newsletters as an aid in professional growth. The readers were virtually unanimous in their feeling that they were free to contribute material to their newsletters, but only slightly more than sixty per cent felt that their newsletters were being managed {{on the basis of the}} readers' opinions. The most important contributions of newsletters in the eyes of the readers were the building of professional spirit and the aiding in classroom teaching. The most often mentioned criticism was that of inadequate content, but there was little agreement as to what constituted adequate material. Conclusions - Unquestionably the major purpose of mathematics newsletters as determined by this survey is the professional improvement of teachers of mathematics with the resultant raising of the quality of mathematics instruction. Editors and readers are largely agreed that the newsletters are making a significant contribution in the area of the teaching of mathematics and in serving as a common bond uniting mathematics teachers. Although the range of articles found in newsletters is wide, virtually all types may be considered in one of three categories - those directly relating to the professional body sponsoring a publication, those concerning the actual teaching of mathematics, and those of a personal or recreational nature. The opinions of the editors and readers vary somewhat as to the popularity and usefulness of the several types of articles. The editors gave high ranking to articles dealing with the sponsoring organization whereas the readers expressed preference for methods of teaching and teaching aids. This divergence of opinion suggests that perhaps some newsletters are not providing the type of material desired by its readers...|$|R
