40|$|Based on the {{nonlinear}} {{finite element}} method, the basic characters of road engineering reinforced with back berm are studied. It is {{found that there}} is no influence on maximal vertical settlement and distribution of vertical settlement in the scope of original embankment by back berm, only the vertical settlement <b>of</b> foundation under <b>back</b> berm enlarged by back berm. The lateral displacement of embankment could be reduced by back berm, which reduced further by width <b>of</b> <b>back</b> berm enlarged. The stability of embankment increased rapidly with the width <b>of</b> <b>back</b> berm enlarged. But when the width <b>of</b> <b>back</b> berm reach a critical value, the stability of embankment is no more increased with the width <b>of</b> <b>back</b> berm enlarged. In order to utilize land effectively, the width <b>of</b> <b>back</b> berm should not be bigger than the critical value. The critical value <b>of</b> width <b>of</b> <b>back</b> berm could be calculated with the corresponding parameters of road engineering. There is almost no influence on stability of embankment by gravity <b>of</b> <b>back</b> berm. It is suggested to fill the back berm by the soil with big cohesive strength and big internal friction angle...|$|R

5|$|In 1978, when Vietnamese leaders {{launched}} their invasion of Kampuchea {{to remove the}} Khmer Rouge regime, they did not expect a negative reaction from the international community. However, the events that followed the invasion showed that Vietnamese leaders had severely miscalculated international sympathies towards their cause. Instead <b>of</b> <b>backing</b> Vietnam, most United Nations member countries denounced the Vietnamese {{use of force against}} Kampuchea, and even moved to revive the battered Khmer Rouge organisation that had once governed the country with such brutality. Thus, more than just a military problem, Kampuchea quickly evolved into an economic and diplomatic problem for Vietnam on the international arena. Throughout the decade in which Vietnam occupied neighbouring Kampuchea, the Vietnamese Government, and the PRK regime which it installed, were placed {{on the periphery of the}} international community.|$|E
5|$|Now {{without the}} Hot Band or a {{recording}} contract, Sylvester set himself {{up with a}} new band, The Four As, and a new set <b>of</b> <b>backing</b> singers, two black drag queens named Jerry Kirby and Lady Bianca. With this new entourage, he continued to perform at a number of local venues including Jewel's Catch One, a predominantly black gay dance club on West Pico Avenue in Los Angeles, but reviewers were unimpressed with the new line-up, most of whom abandoned Sylvester in December 1974. After a brief sojourn in England, Sylvester returned to San Francisco and assembled three young drag queens to be backing singers: Arnold Elzie, Leroy Davis, and Gerry Kirby. Nevertheless, although he performed at such events as the 1975 Castro Street Fair, success continued to elude him, and he eventually fired Elzie, Davis, and Kirby.|$|E

5|$|Villagers in {{northern}} Albania and western Kosovo reported hearing explosions {{in the vicinity}} of the ambush and seeing helicopters flying overhead for much of the following day. Albanian officials later alleged that two of these helicopters had violated the country's airspace, and Albania moved elite army units to the Yugoslav border in response. Yugoslav authorities accused Albania <b>of</b> <b>backing</b> the KLA. In response to the ambush, U.S. officials indicated that they would push for sanctions to be re-implemented against Yugoslavia, and said they would look to freeze the country's assets overseas. Some Albanian sources alleged that the men had not been ambushed, rather they were abducted and killed by Yugoslav security forces. Such claims could not be verified by Western journalists, and later that year, Amnesty International affirmed that the men were killed in an ambush while smuggling weapons across the border.|$|E
5|$|Much of the post-race debate {{centred on}} the Red Bulls' clash {{at the front}} of the field on lap 40. Both Webber and Vettel blamed each other for the crash. Team {{principal}} Christian Horner implied Webber remained partially responsible for failing to give Vettel enough room on the run to the corner, and he was noticeably frustrated and angry at both of his drivers for wasting a potential 1–2 finish. Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko insisted the team did not favour Vettel through their strategy and also offered the perspective that Vettel had to attack for fear <b>of</b> <b>backing</b> off into the clutches of Hamilton behind. McLaren chief engineer Tim Goss said the crash had prevented Red Bull from securing a 1–2 finish, but understood why Webber switched to a different engine mode as he noted that one of Vettel's engines had failed earlier in the season. He felt that the battle between both McLaren and Red Bull drivers for both championships would continue unabated. Red Bull held a meeting at their factory in Milton Keynes four days after the race, and all people in attendance believed the situation had been dealt with. The incident between Webber and Vettel is widely seen by the media as a key moment in the rivalry between the two drivers, which had started when Vettel collided with Webber at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix and both drivers were forced to retire.|$|E
5|$|Rowland ran wide while de Jong {{reversed}} {{onto the}} run-off area. This {{was caused by}} both drivers not gaining optimum brake temperature. De Jong dropped to fifth while Rowland fell to third after the latter was passed by Sirotkin. Armand spun in the seventh corner, triggering the safety car's second appearance. It remained on the track {{for the next three}} laps. On the restart, Matsushita utilised a tactic <b>of</b> <b>backing</b> the field up before driving away. However some drivers accelerated away after passing the safety car line, while others remained at the pace dictated by Matsushita. This resulted in Malja colliding with the rear-end of Evans's car, removing his front wing, and sending debris from it airborne. Malja then hit Rowland in the first corner. He spun but managed to continue. Gelael was forced to collide with the barrier, causing him to retire. The incident resulted in the safety car's third deployment which remained on track for the next two laps. At the lap 13 restart, Marciello got away faster than Matsushita and drove around the inside of him but locked his tyres. The two made contact when they steered into turn one. The incident allowed Gasly to inherit the lead, with teammate Giovinazzi moving into second.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the relationship between physical and psychological risk factors on the one hand, and the occurrence of new episodes <b>of</b> <b>back</b> pain on the other hand. A prospective study was conducted with 12 months follow-up by means of self-administered questionnaires. The study took place in the Cargo Department of a major Dutch airline company. The subjects for this study were 270 workers involved in heavy physical work. Only workers without back pain at baseline were included. Self-reported back pain and sick leave due to back pain during the follow-up period were measured. Of the 238 workers included in the analysis, 73 (31 %) developed a new episode <b>of</b> <b>back</b> pain during the follow-up period, and 27 (11 %) subjects reported sick leave due to back pain. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the history <b>of</b> <b>back</b> pain was the best predictor for the occurrence of a new episode <b>of</b> <b>back</b> pain during follow-up (OR 9. 8; 95 % CI 2. 8 - 34. 4 for subjects who had back pain more than twice in the past year). Low job satisfaction was also associated with an increased risk for the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>back</b> pain during follow-up (OR 1. 2; 95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 4). Riding a forklift truck appeared to be a protective factor for the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>back</b> pain (OR 0. 7; 95 % CI 0. 5 - 0. 99). In this study the best predictors for the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>back</b> pain were the history <b>of</b> <b>back</b> complaints and low job satisfaction. Although it needs to be confirmed by future intervention studies, the results indicate that increasing job satisfaction may be a successful (co-) intervention for the prevention <b>of</b> <b>back</b> pain at the workplace.

40|$|Background: Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} {{have become}} increasingly common among healthcare providers. They have become {{the most common cause}} of work-related disabilities among nurses. Objectives: The current cross-sectional study aimed to measure the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>back</b> pains among emergency medical technicians (EMTs), and association <b>of</b> <b>back</b> pain with quality of life, depression, anxiety and stress. Materials and Methods: One hundred and eighty registered nurses working as EMTs at the Hamadan Emergency Medical Center were selected by consensus. Data collection tools were Demographic, Perceived Quality-of-Life, Short Form Health Survey (SF- 36), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DAS 21) and pain scale measurements. Results: Data showed that while 50. 7 % of the participants had an average awareness of the basic principles <b>of</b> <b>back</b> care, the majority (71. 8 %) had at least one type <b>of</b> <b>back</b> pain. There were associations between the prevalence of pain and depression (P = 0. 049), pain and awareness (P = 0. 035), and stress and job satisfaction (P = 0. 024). Conclusions: A large number (about two-thirds) of EMTs had some sort <b>of</b> <b>back</b> pain; it is highly recommended to promote the attitude and motivation of the individuals to take care to prevent back injury and inform them of the principles <b>of</b> <b>back</b> care.

40|$|Evaporation is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used deposition method in the processing <b>of</b> <b>back</b> electrodes in polymer solar cells used in scientifi c studies. However, vacuum-based methods such as evaporation are uneconomical in the upscaling of polymer solar cells as they are throughput limiting steps in an otherwise fast roll-to-roll production line. In this paper, the applicability of inkjet printing in the ambient processing <b>of</b> <b>back</b> electrodes in inverted polymer solar cells with the structure ITO/ZnO/P 3 HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag is investigated. Furthermore, the limitation of screen printing, the commonly employed method in the ambient processing <b>of</b> <b>back</b> electrode, is demonstrated and discussed. Both inkjet printing and screen printing <b>of</b> <b>back</b> electrodes are studied for their impact on the photovoltaic properties of the polymer solar cells measured under 1000 Wm − 2 AM 1. 5.
