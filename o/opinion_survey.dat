40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the use of}} public <b>opinion</b> <b>surveys</b> as tools to advance administrative reforms in western European countries and central and eastern European countries.

Up to now, public <b>opinion</b> <b>surveys</b> have received a great deal of scientific attention with regard to methodological problems of data gathering, data analysis and interpretation of data.
