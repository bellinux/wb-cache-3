5|$|In 1889 in his winter home in Riverside, California, Loring {{constructed}} an <b>office</b> <b>block</b> with a 1,000-seat {{theater on}} the first floor that hosted performers such as W.C. Fields and Sarah Bernhardt. At various times known as the Loring Opera House, Loring Theatre, Fox Riverside, and Golden State Theatre, the theater was destroyed by fire in 1990. The office building was leased to the city for use as its first City Hall, library, jail and municipal courts.|$|E
5|$|The Eastgate Centre is a {{shopping}} centre and <b>office</b> <b>block</b> in central Harare, Zimbabwe, whose architect, Mick Pearce, used passive cooling inspired by that {{used by the}} local termites. It {{was the first major}} building exploiting termite-inspired cooling techniques to attract international attention. Other such buildings include the Learning Resource Center at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa and the Council House 2 building in Melbourne, Australia.|$|E
5|$|The FBI {{task force}} rush {{to locate the}} bomb, tracing the phonecall to a small {{section of the city}} that might house it. Scanning the area, Black notices another parking garage {{opposite}} an <b>office</b> <b>block,</b> and attempts to have the building evacuated. However, Dees has planted a second bomb which detonates fifteen minutes early, while Black is inside the building. However, he is pulled to safety by a stranger, who is interviewed on the news following the explosion—Raymond Dees.|$|E
5000|$|The {{warehouses}} and wharf facilities near the Opera House were progressively removed in the mid-20th century {{and replaced by}} modernist <b>office</b> <b>blocks.</b> In 1998, the Bennelong Apartments, a complex of contemporary buildings nicknamed [...] "the Toaster", replaced the modernist <b>office</b> <b>blocks.</b> The complex includes private apartments, retail outlets, restaurants, the Pullman Quay Grand Hotel and a cinema.|$|R

5|$|In 1988 Regalian Properties {{purchased}} the site, and appointed Terry Farrell as architect. Farrell designed a self-contained community of shops, housing, offices and public spaces for the site. Regalian disliked the proposals and requested Farrell design a single large <b>office</b> <b>block.</b> Despite containing 50% more office space than the rejected Green Giant proposal, the design was accepted. The government then bought {{the site and}} design as a future headquarters for the Secret Intelligence Service, and the design was accordingly modified to increase security. In 1995 the SIS Building was opened on the site, and today dominates other buildings {{in the vicinity of}} the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The station's fourth span was renovated in 2010, {{involving}} {{repair and}} {{restoration of the}} original glazed roof, so that platforms 9 to 12 inclusive can once more enjoy daylight. A false ceiling or crash deck had been in place since 1996. Work was completed and the restored roof unveiled in July 2011. A second phase of improvements began in July 2014 and was completed two years later. Network Rail originally planned to demolish Span 4 and build an <b>office</b> <b>block</b> over {{that part of the}} station; Save Britain's Heritage successfully campaigned against this.|$|E
5|$|The young {{municipality}} got {{its first}} boost in 1889 when Frank Ross and James McLaren opened {{what would become}} Fraser Mills, a $350,000, then state-of-the-art lumber mill on the north bank of the Fraser River. The District of Coquitlam was incorporated in 1891. By 1908, a mill town of 20 houses, a store, post office, hospital, <b>office</b> <b>block,</b> barber shop, and pool hall had grown around the mill. A mill manager's residence was built that would later become Place des Arts.|$|E

5|$|Access to {{the more}} northerly (Bakerloo) part of the station is via the {{original}} building, while the exit is via a new extension next to Skipton House. Between the entrance and two shops is the entrance to South London House, an <b>office</b> <b>block</b> above the station. The BS station building remains much as originally constructed and is a typical Leslie Green structure. The main alteration is a modern glass-sided and glass-topped flat-roofed extension abutting the original western elevation, giving access to three of the six arches. These arches, in a classic deep-red faience style, formed the original perimeter: two are infilled with street-facing shops. As the station also functions as a drivers' depot, London Underground uses the offices above the station for administration and drivers' accommodation.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{in modern}} Scotland {{encompasses}} all building in Scotland, between {{the beginning of}} the twentieth century and the present day. The most significant architect of the early twentieth century was Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who mixed elements of traditional Scottish architecture with contemporary movements. Estate house design declined in importance in the twentieth century. In the early decades of the century, traditional materials began to give way to cheaper modern ones. After the First World War modernism and the <b>office</b> <b>block</b> began to dominate building in the major cities and attempts began to improve the quality of urban housing for the poor, resulted in a massive programme of council house building. The Neo-Gothic style continued in to the twentieth century but the most common forms in this period were plain and massive Neo-Romanesque buildings.|$|E
5|$|Central Saint Giles {{provides}} 66,090m² {{of floor}} space – almost {{double that of}} the old St Giles Court – split between two separate buildings. The 15-storey west block is for residential use, providing 109 flats of which 53 are designated as affordable. The much larger horseshoe-shaped eastern block, standing 11 storeys high, encircles a publicly accessible courtyard comprising 27% of the site's area. It provides 37,625m² of office space with {{by far the largest}} floor plates of any <b>office</b> <b>block</b> in the West End of London, with 4,000m² on all but the top two floors. At ground level, 2,276m² of space is available for retail outlets and restaurants. The block is irregularly shaped with recesses, projections and roof terraces intended to make it look more interesting and to break up its bulk.|$|E
50|$|This has two <b>office</b> <b>blocks</b> with 150,000 sq. ft. and 170,000 sq. ft. respectively. Each {{office has}} 20,000 sq. ft. floor plate.|$|R

50|$|The Chan Building was {{the eighth}} and {{last of the}} large {{government}} <b>office</b> <b>blocks</b> {{to be built in}} the centre of Darwin in the 1960s. It was known as Block 8 for the first ten years of its existence and was named the Chan Building after Harry Chan (1918-1969) a Chinese-Australian businessman and former mayor of Darwin around 1980. It is the last of this group of <b>office</b> <b>blocks</b> left standing; all the others being demolished by the late 1990s.|$|R
5|$|Elsewhere on the Camp, the Army began {{replacing}} the wartime Nissen huts with more permanent structures. New barracks opened in 1955, and the Headquarters of the Army in Scotland arrived {{the same year}} from Edinburgh Castle. Further land was purchased from Lord Rosebery and married quarters were built close to the river. In 1966, a purpose-built <b>office</b> <b>block,</b> by architects Bowhill Gibson and Laing, was constructed within the walled garden, and named Annandale Block in honour of the builder of Craigiehall. Craigiehall Camp was also {{the site of a}} Cold War Anti-Aircraft Operations Room, built in the 1950s. The two-storey, reinforced concrete structure was listed in 2016 as the best surviving example of its type in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Greyfriars, in Bristol, England, was a Franciscan friary. The name Greyfriars {{derived from}} the grey robes worn by the friars. It was founded at some time before 1234, within the town walls and then moved to Lewin's Mead in 1250. The site {{included}} extensive gardens surrounded by a stone wall. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the sixteenth century, the premises were leased to the town council in 1541, who desired to use the stone to make repairs to the town walls, and the harbour facilities. In succeeding centuries many different uses have {{been made of the}} site, which is currently occupied by an <b>office</b> <b>block</b> and part of Bristol Dental School.|$|E
5|$|Leeds Dock was {{originally}} a large timber dock, situated {{between the city}} centre and Hunslet. Decades of industrial decline left the dock obsolete. The opening of the Royal Armouries Museum in 1996 began the regeneration of the area, however little else was undertaken, until the wider redevelopment began in 2001. This was completed in 2007 (at a cost of £260million) and includes flats, offices, bars, restaurants, a hotel and a casino. The development centres on the dock itself as well as around 'Armouries Boulevard' and 'Armouries Square', two pedestrianised thoroughfares. The main <b>office</b> <b>block</b> on the development is Livingston House which has not yet attracted a tenant. The smaller dock incorporates six residential berths for house boats, while a passenger boat service to Granary Wharf runs from here.|$|E

5|$|The Strand Palace Hotel was {{designed}} by F.J.Wills and constructed in 1925–30. The entrance was rebuilt in 1968, with the original being moved to the Victoria and Albert Museum. The Strand underwent extensive redevelopment in the mid-20th century. The length of road from St Mary's eastwards up to St Clement's was widened in 1900, subsuming the former Holywell Street which forked from the Strand and ran parallel with it to the north, leaving the two churches of St Mary Le Strand and St.Clement Danes as islands in {{the centre of the}} road. Gaiety Theatre was demolished, to be replaced by Citibank House, while Villiers House and New South Wales House were both built in 1957–59. New South Wales House was subsequently demolished in 1996 and replaced by an <b>office</b> <b>block.</b> In 1998, a statue of Oscar Wilde was built at the junction of Adelaide Street and Duncannon Street, adjoining the western end of the Strand.|$|E
5|$|The {{person is}} Captain John Hart (James Marsters), a fellow Time Agent and former lover of Jack. He is {{responsible}} for the death, and a public disturbance at a nightclub. After a passionate kiss and brief fight at the nightclub, John tells Jack that the Time Agency was disbanded and he has since undergone several rehabilitation programmes, before the team catch up with Jack and are introduced to John. John accompanies the team back to the Hub, where he tells the team of three cylindrical devices scattered throughout Cardiff, which he explains are radioactive cluster bombs, and he requires help to defuse them. Thus, they split into three pairs: Jack and administrator Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd) search an <b>office</b> <b>block</b> (during which Jack successfully asks Ianto out on a date), doctor Owen Harper (Burn Gorman) and technical expert Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) search a warehouse, and police liaison Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) and John search the nearby docks.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} {{area was}} originally home to Victorian housing but in 1977, the city used eminent domain {{to purchase the}} area southwest of Mount Vernon Square itself, {{and over the next}} few years, the homes and businesses on these blocks were razed. In the 1980s, Golub Realty and Willco Construction purchased the site and proposed an 11-floor <b>office</b> <b>block.</b> They sold it to Peterson Co., who sold it to Monument Realty in May 1999. Monument Realty had envisaged building either an office and retail complex, or a 1,000-room hotel. They finally sold it to Boston Properties for $43.2 million in October 2000. Boston Properties closed the parking lot on the site in late August 2002, and began construction of the building the following month.|$|E
