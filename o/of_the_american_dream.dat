Noted by critics for its maximalist aesthetic, opulent production quality, and dichotomous themes, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy incorporates aspects of West's previous works, including soul, baroque, electro, and symphonic styles. The album deals with themes of excess and celebrity, and explores such issues as consumer culture, race, and the idealism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Dream.</b>|$|E
5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its social commentary. Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an indictment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>dream</b> and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E
5|$|Primarily a coming-of-age story (Bildungsroman) {{and family}} saga, the novel chronicles {{the effect of}} a mutated gene on three generations of a Greek family, causing momentous changes in the protagonist's life.

It discusses the pursuit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Dream</b> and explores gender identity. The novel contains many allusions to Greek mythology, including creatures such as the Minotaur, half-man and half-bull, and the Chimera, a monster composed of various animal parts.|$|E

5|$|Calhoun's father, Patrick Calhoun, {{helped shape}} his son's {{political}} views. He was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on {{a commitment to}} the ideal of popular self-government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves. Flourishing {{in a world in which}} slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization, Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult. He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the civic-mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed. From such a standpoint, the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension when money would become the only measure of self-worth, as had happened in New England. Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was the key to the success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>dream.</b>|$|E

Miller sent a copy of the play to Elia Kazan who directed the original stage version of All My Sons. Kazan was a former member of the Communist Party who shared Miller's left-wing views.

25|$|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Dream</b> is a {{novel by}} Hunter S. Thompson, {{illustrated}} by Ralph Steadman. The book is a roman à clef, rooted in autobiographical incidents. The story follows its protagonist, Raoul Duke, and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, as they descend on Las Vegas to chase the American Dream through a drug-induced haze, all the while ruminating on {{the failure of the}} 1960s countercultural movement. The work is Thompson's most famous book, and is noted for its lurid descriptions of illegal drug use and its early retrospective on the culture of the 1960s. Its popularization of Thompson's highly subjective blend of fact and fiction has become known as gonzo journalism. The novel first appeared as a two-part series in Rolling Stone magazine in 1971, and was published as a book in 1972. It was later adapted into a film of the same name in 1998 by Terry Gilliam, starring Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro who portrayed Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo, respectively.|$|E

In 1970, Roger Pearson published the article Gatsby: False prophet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Dream,</b> in which he states that Fitzgerald [...] "has come to be associated with this concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AMERICAN</b> <b>Dream</b> more than any other writer of the twentieth century". Pearson goes on to suggest that Gatsby's failure to realize the American dream demonstrates that it no longer exists except in the minds of those as materialistic as Gatsby. He concludes that the American dream pursued by Gatsby [...] "is, in reality, a nightmare", bringing nothing but discontent and disillusionment to those who chase it as they realize its unsustainability and ultimately its unattainability.|$|E

Ayers and Edwin Birdsong were inspired to write the song by President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1965 speech [...] "The American Promise", which called for justice and equal rights in the United States. [...] "Amerykahn Promise" [...] features explicit political satire, with themes of disfranchisement and the hindrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Dream.</b> Its tongue-in-cheek subject matter portrays America as a land of broken promises. The song opens with a blaxploitation trailer blurb, saying [...] "more action, more excitement, more everything", and features an improvisatory funk vamp, RAMP vocalists Sibel Thrasher and Sharon Matthews, and an authoritative male voice, performed by Keith. The authoritative character is portrayed as a circus-barker whose smoke and mirrors presentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Dream</b> leads to contentious dialogue with Badu.
