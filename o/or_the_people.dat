Various executives, first at Tymshare and later at McDonnell Douglas, which acquired Tymshare in 1984, expressed interest in his ideas, but never committed the funds <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> to further develop them. His interest inside of McDonnell Douglas {{was focused on the}} enormous knowledge management and IT requirements involved in the life cycle of an aerospace program, which served to strengthen Engelbart's resolve to motivate the information technology arena toward global interoperability and an open hyperdocument system. Engelbart retired from McDonnell Douglas in 1986, determined to pursue his work free from commercial pressure.|$|E

5|$|The Bill of Rights is {{the first}} ten {{amendments}} to the United States Constitution. Proposed following the oftentimes bitter 1787–88 battle over ratification of the U.S. Constitution, and crafted to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, the Bill of Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those found in several earlier documents, including the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the English Bill of Rights 1689, along with earlier documents such as Magna Carta (1215). In practice, the amendments had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first 150 years after ratification.|$|E

The Cucapá are descendants of the Yuman-speaking Native Indigenous peoples of the Americas and have inhabited the delta for nearly a thousand years. Spanish explorer Hernando de Alarcón made the first recorded contact with the Cucapá in 1540 and reported seeing many thousands. The Cucapá used the delta floodplain extensively, for harvesting Palmer’s saltgrass (Distichlis palmeri), a wild grain which grows in salty soil; and for cultivating maize (corn), beans, and squash.|$|E

The amendment was also meant to implement the values and ideals formulated by the Preamble and to prevent the power holders from doing power abuse by returning back the sovereignty to the people; confining the power and authority of MPR as well as the President, but enforcing the power and authority of DPR <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>People’s</b> Representative Council; promoting autonomy for the local governments; establishing DPD <b>or</b> <b>the</b> Regional Representative Council, the Judicial Commission as well as the Constitution Court; guaranteeing the honor of human rights; improving the quality of education by allocating 20 percent of the national and local government budget; etc. In order not to deviate from the basic values formulated in the Preamble, the amendment did not at all touch the Preamble and not alter the form of the unitary state of the Republic of Indonesia.

It relented after Congress sent a series of constitutional amendments to the states for ratification, the Bill of Rights guaranteeing specific personal freedoms and rights; clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings; and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> On May 29, 1790, Rhode Island became the 13th state and the last of the former colonies to ratify the Constitution.|$|E

One former UNIFIL official explained that he has been in these situations before, and when the opposing sides are determined to shoot each other, there’s nothing UNIFIL force can do.

25|$|The {{establishment}} of the bank also raised early questions of constitutionality in the new government. Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, argued that the bank was an effective means to utilize the authorized powers of the government implied under {{the law of the}} Constitution. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson argued that the bank violated traditional property laws and that its relevance to constitutionally authorized powers was weak. Another argument came from James Madison, who believed Congress had not received the power to incorporate a bank, or any other governmental agency. His argument rested primarily on the Tenth Amendment: that all powers not endowed to Congress are retained by the States (<b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>people).</b> Additionally, his belief was that if the Constitution's writers had wanted Congress to have such power, they would have made it explicit. The decision would ultimately fall on President George Washington, following his deliberate investigation of the cabinet members' opinions.|$|E
25|$|In 1857 a {{concordat}} {{was entered}} into between the Holy See and Portugal, pending {{the execution of}} which both the vicars Apostolic and the authorities of the diocese were to enjoy pacific possession of the places they actually held. But the Crown of Portugal undertook manifestly too great a burden, to wit, {{to provide for the}} spiritual needs of the whole of India, and consequently the concordat remained a dead letter. In 1854 the Royal Missionary College of Bomjardim at Sernache, Portugal was founded for the training of secular priests for the Portuguese missions beyond the seas. Meanwhile the missions of the diocese had been greatly weakened by secessions to the vicars Apostolic. The missions were situated in British territory and as beyond the clergy there were scarcely any Portuguese subjects to be found throughout the diocese there was no particular inducement <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> to cling to the see.|$|E
25|$|Irish {{universities}} {{have a long}} tradition of electing independent candidates. Some, like the pressure group Graduate Equality, argue that the franchise for electing university senators should be extended to the graduates of all third level institutions. Others believe that this does not go far enough and that at least some portion of the Seanad should be directly elected by all adult citizens. Calls have also been made for the Seanad to be used to represent Irish emigrants <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of Northern Ireland. In 1999 the Reform Movement called for some of the Taoiseach's nominations to be reserved for members of the Irish-British minority, and other minorities such as members of the Travelling Community and recently arrived immigrants. The Seventh Amendment in 1979 altered the provisions of Article 18.4 to allow for a redistribution of the university seats to any other institutes of higher education in the state, although no change has in fact taken place since then.|$|E
