A self-administered questionnaire survey with measurement in Likert scale was used to collect the required data from the users for comparison. Wilcoxon signed rank tests for single and paired samples were used to analyze the data. Results of the analysis show that Hong Kong port excels in facilities, services, and management while Shenzhen port surpasses in location and costs. The respective advantages are related to the historical development of the two ports and their geographical locations with respect to the common hinterland - the Pearl River Delta region. Ways to enhance collaboration between the two ports include, among others, information sharing to improve visibility, road network and <b>other</b> <b>infrastructure</b> <b>investment</b> to strengthen linkage, and joint venture to develop port-centric logistics. The findings shed light on the relative significance of the factors affecting the choice of ports of freight forwarding and shipping companies and provide an objective empirical basis for comparing the competitiveness between ports.

This might not be a correct policy {{prescription for}} resource-rich sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, where public capital is very low to support the needed economic growth. In such countries, rents from resources serve as opportunity to scale-up the needed public capital.

We also find evidence of a positive effect of public investment on economic growth, which also depends on the level of resource rents. Using some of the components of public investment, such as health and education expenditure, we find a negative effect of resource rents, suggesting among other things that public spending of resource rents is directed more to <b>other</b> <b>infrastructure</b> <b>investments...</b>|$|R

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in the area of <b>infrastructure</b> <b>investment</b> is the provision of funding to finance activities. This paper presents an auction design which can reduce the financing cost of <b>infrastructure</b> <b>investments</b> by allowing the length of the regulatory funding period to be determined via an auction. The auction allows bidders to submit bids against a payment for periods of varying length. Thus instead of, for example, a fixed 20 -year contract period, some bidders might want to bid for financing over a longer period, say 25 or 30 years. This can be desirable in terms of securing more favourable terms in the financial markets. Our auction design can secure efficiency and lower financing costs.

40|$|Investment in IT {{has become}} a {{dominant}} part of the capital expenditure budget of many organisations in both the service and manufacturing sectors. As a result decision-makers are faced with difficult questions: How should IT investments be designed and managed to ensure alignment with corporate strategy? How should such investments be justified prospectively, and how can success be measured retrospectively? What more (than technology) is needed to realise the full potential of IT? What are the risk implications of these investments? How can the value of IT investments be managed over time? These questions are not new, {{but they have not}} been answered satisfactorily. In this chapter we develop a formal and practical methodology to evaluate investments in information technology infrastructure. Determining the value of IT investments is inherently difficult. Although the costs seem readily identifiable, many of the benefits are elusive. For example, consider the investment in an electronic mail system within a geographically dispersed workgroup.

40|$|Background. The term “public-private {{partnership}} ” (“partnership”) encompasses {{many different}} types of projects. Governments and government finance officers need to understand the different risks and rewards associated with various public-private partnership endeavors. Traditionally, the term “public-private partnership” has referred to private or public-private projects that involve the use of public resources or financing capabilities to promote local economic development. In those arrangements, the public entity is typically asked to provide some combination of tax incentives, public land or <b>other</b> assets, <b>infrastructure</b> <b>investments</b> or financing methods. In consideration of those public contributions, the private entity is asked to make capital investments, commit to provide jobs, contribute development expertise and assume financial risk. These “partnerships ” (which typically are not partnerships legally) can have short life spans covering only the construction period for the project, or longer life spans covering debt repayment or long-term operating agreements. The public-private partnership term has also been used to refer to transactions that are essentially privatization efforts, in which a state or local government enters into a long-term lease of a major asset (e. g., toll road, parking garage, airport, etc.) to a private-sector company and transfers the rights and responsibilities for the leased asset to the private company, or to transactions aimed at privatizing or outsourcing the provision of services that a governmental body had been providing directly.

40|$|Economic {{growth and}} {{development}} remains an important policy issue {{for most of the}} states in the world, which is a particular issue for late developing countries, as they have very much relied on ‘state’ for economic {{growth and development}}. As a result, the experience in the 20 th century demonstrates a secular increase in the growth of government expenditures all over the world. Hence, the role of government expenditures in contributing to long run economic growth continues to be an important topic and the subject of much debate. Saudi Arabia economy is one of late developing countries. While its economy is characterised by an open and private economy, the government remains to have a large role in the economy through its expenditures financed largely by revenues generated from oil. While the Saudi economy has grown and developed, the government has also responded to the increased demand for social services such as education and healthcare in addition to <b>other</b> <b>infrastructure</b> <b>investments</b> for development purpose. Therefore, the process of economic growth and development has resulted in growth of government expenditures. This research, thus, aims at modelling of government expenditures and economic growth nexus in the case o Saudi Arabia for the period of 1968 - 2010 by testing a number of models developed in the literature: Wagner’s Law, Keynesian Relations and Peacock and Wiseman’s Displacement Effect. The analysis modelled within the time series econometric techniques including co-integration test, Granger causality test and the error correction model (ECM). The findings obtained from the analyses find that the Wagnerian proposition can explain the growth of government in Saudi Arabia, which holds for both the oil and non-oil income cases. The result indicates the existence of strong feedback causality for all the versions of Wagner’s law in the long run. The findings also note that the three versions of Keynesian Relations found to be held for both general income and non-oil income in the case of Saudi Arabia. In addition, the findings also support for the Displacement Effect mainly due to international political developments and trends in oil prices, as such events resulted deviation from the linear growth in the government expenditures over the average growth and it is observed that government expenditure growth continued its gradual growth from the new level. This study, thus, concludes that growing economic activity of the state has marked the Saudi Arabian economy over the period in question. While this partly can be explained due to economic reasons such as the need for economic development and responding to the demands of a growing population, but also the rentier economy nature of the Saudi political economy necessitates increasing government expenditures for political stability. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{desire to}} create a more competitive, market based {{transport}} system has led to the involvement of the private sector in <b>infrastructure</b> <b>investments.</b> However, there are still distinct aspects that often make <b>investment</b> in transport <b>infrastructure</b> unattractive to private parties. This paper elucidates the characteristics of <b>investments</b> in <b>infrastructure</b> in general, with the aim to clarify the hesitation of private investors. One specific category of <b>infrastructure</b> <b>investments,</b> viz. container terminals, is discussed here as an interesting case. European container terminals are mostly financed with a strong involvement of private parties. From a comparative study between investments in container terminals and <b>other</b> <b>investments</b> in <b>infrastructure,</b> we argue that the terminal market has several features (such as imperfect competition), which lead to a lower risk for private parties. Because of these characteristics, public-private partnerships occur rather often and seem to be attractive.

It should be realised however, that a common European policy is required to avoid distortion of competition among ports due to different subsidy regimes.
