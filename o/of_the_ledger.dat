25|$|Both the Nationals' {{starting}} shortstop, Trea Turner, and {{his primary}} backup, Stephen Drew, {{were placed on}} the 10-day disabled list with strained hamstrings within days of one another. The team recalled Taylor on April 10 and purchased the contract of utility infielder Grant Green on April 12, making Green the third non-roster invitee to the Nationals' spring training in West Palm Beach (after Guthrie, who was removed from the roster after less than 24 hours, and Albers) added to the roster during the month. Turner was activated on April 21 for a game against the division rival New York Mets, and Green was designated for assignment; in his return, as a pinch-hitter, Turner had the game-winning RBI in a 4–3 victory when he took a bases-loaded walk in the 11th inning. On the pitching side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ledger,</b> left-handed reliever Sammy Solis was placed on the disabled list with elbow inflammation on April 19, and the Nationals called up Joe Ross to start against the division rival Atlanta Braves; Washington won that game 14–4 on the back of two grand slams, struck by right fielder Bryce Harper and first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, in a 20-hit effort and Ross earned the win.|$|E

25|$|One issue {{concerns}} {{the relationship between}} the real economy (producing goods and services) and the financial economy (trading assets). Some argue, like Marx did, that the tendency of the rate of profit to fall applies only to the sphere of the capitalist industrial production of commodities, not to the whole capitalist economy. Thus, it is argued, it is eminently possible that while industrial profitability stagnates, average profitability in activities external to the sphere of industrial production increases. In fact, Michael Hudson claims that in the United States, only about a quarter of workers' gross wages is spent on the purchase of actual goods and services. All the rest is spent on the payment of rents and mortgages, retirement schemes and insurance, loans and interest, and various taxes Costas Lapavitsas adds to this insight that not just household liabilities, but also household assets have to be looked at: the rich 20% of the world's workers have substantial deposits and savings invested with banks and retirement funds, so that, on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ledger,</b> they become fully dependent on finance capital. Since labor incomes rose strongly in rich countries along with population growth {{in the second half of}} the 20th century, very large savings became available in retirement funds, representing an additional source of capital invested for profit worldwide and increasing the economic power of the finance industry. In 2008, the world's total tradeable financial assets (stocks, debt securities and bank deposits) were estimated at $178 trillion, more than three times the value of what the whole world produces in a year. In June 2017, the world's total public and private debt was estimated at US$217 trillion, again more than three times the value of what the whole world produces in a year. If one assumes a grand-average net profit rate of 5% on this global debt, the profit made from global debt is roughly equal to the annual national income of China. This has created a world in industrialized countries that is very different from the orthodox classical revolutionary Marxist analysis of the commodity, where workers simply exchange their commodity labor power for a wage to buy a bundle of consumable commodities with.|$|E

[...] While Arthur was not opposed to internal improvements, the scale of the bill disturbed him, as did its narrow focus on [...] "particular localities," [...] rather than projects that benefited a larger part of the nation. [...] On August1, 1882, Arthur vetoed the bill to widespread popular acclaim; in his veto message, his principal objection was that it appropriated funds for purposes [...] "not for the common defense or general welfare, and which do not promote commerce among the States." [...] Congress overrode his veto the next day and the new law reduced the surplus by $19 million.

500|$|In several Buddhist countries, it {{has been}} common to record merits done. In China, it was common for many centuries to keep record of someone's meritorious deeds in 'merit ledgers' (...) [...] Although a belief in merit and {{retribution}} had preceded <b>the</b> merit <b>ledgers</b> by many centuries, <b>the</b> <b>ledgers</b> established a practice of systematic merit accumulation for the first time. [...] <b>The</b> merit <b>ledgers</b> were lists of good deeds and bad deeds, organized in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a calendar for users to calculate to what extent they had been practicing good deeds and avoiding bad deeds every day. <b>The</b> <b>ledgers</b> also listed <b>the</b> exact retributions <b>of</b> every number of deeds done, to the detail. Through these ledgers it was believed someone could offset bad karma. In the fourth century CE, the Baopuzi, and in the twelfth century the Treatise On <b>the</b> Response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tao and <b>the</b> <b>Ledger</b> <b>of</b> Merit and Demerit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Taiwei Immortal introduced <b>the</b> basics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system <b>of</b> merit <b>ledgers.</b> In <b>the</b> fourteenth century CE, the Tao master Zhao Yizhen recommended <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ledgers</b> to examine oneself, to bring emotion in harmony with reason. From the fourth to the sixteenth centuries, many types of ledgers were produced by Buddhist and Tao schools, and <b>the</b> usage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ledgers</b> grew widespread. <b>The</b> practice <b>of</b> recording merits has survived in China and Japan until the present day.

2500|$|Thursday afternoon, Father P.J.

During a trip away from the parish, Stockman had left a young and inexperienced priest, Father Joseph O'Reilly, in charge {{of the church}}. [...] The young priest had been {{convinced}} to loan the birth and death registers to Reavis, but had failed to inform Reavis that the church kept a separate index that was organized by last name and updated annually. [...] During Father Stockman's testimony he pointed out differences in the inks between the pages related to Mrs. Reavis and the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ledger.</b> [...] The index made no mention of Doña Sophia Laura or her son and {{there was no evidence of}} either of their graves in the parish graveyard. [...] This testimony was followed by Father O'Reilly, who identified Reavis as the person he had given possession of the record books for a period of between two weeks and a month. [...] Following the priest's testimony the trial returned to an examination of the documentary evidence. [...] Reavis was granted a request to be excused from the court during this phase of the trial.|$|E
2500|$|UConn was no {{stranger}} to low scoring halves in an NCAA game. There had been, up to this point, eleven halves of basketball in NCAA tournament history with twelve or fewer points. UConn was involved in four of them.

However, on this day, Connecticut would be on the opposite side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ledger,</b> scoring only 12 points against Stanford in the first half.

UConn held a 5–0 lead just over two minutes into the game, but they would not score again until after the media timeout with under eight minutes to go in the half. Connecticut hit but 5 of their 29 shot attempts in the first half for a shooting percentage of 17% described by the New York Times as [...] "laughable".

2500|$|The film {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a series of collaborations with Taylor, in addition to making Burton one of the Top 10 box office draws until 1967. Burton played her tycoon husband Paul Andros in Anthony Asquith's The V.I.P.s (1963), an ensemble cast film described by Alpert as a [...] "kind of Grand Hotel story" [...] that was set in the VIP lounge of London Heathrow Airport; it proved to be a box-office hit despite mixed reviews. It was after The V.I.P.s that Burton became considerably more selective about his roles crediting Taylor for this as he simply acted in films [...] "to get rich" [...] and that she [...] "made me see what kind of rubbish I was doing". Burton divorced Sybil in April 1963 after completing The V.I.P.s while Taylor was granted divorce from Fisher on 6 March 1964. Taylor then took a two-year hiatus from films until her next venture with Burton, The Sandpiper (1965). The supercouple, now dubbed [...] "Liz and Dick" [...] by the press, continued starring together in films in the mid-1960s, earning a combined $88million over the next decade and spending $65million. Regarding their earnings, in a 1976 interview with Lester David and Jhan Robbins <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Ledger,</b> Burton stated that [...] "they say we generate more business activity than one of the smaller African nations" [...] and that the couple [...] "often outspent" [...] the Greek business tycoon Aristotle Onassis.|$|E

2500|$|One {{theory is}} that in its {{original}} Latin, Pacioli's Summa used the Latin words [...] (to owe) and [...] (to entrust) to describe {{the two sides of}} a closed accounting transaction. Assets were owed to the owner and the owners' equity was entrusted to the company. At the time negative numbers were not in use. When his work was translated, the Latin words debere and [...] credere became the English debit and credit. Under this theory, the abbreviations Dr (for debit) and Cr (for credit) derive from the original Latin. However, Sherman casts doubt on this idea because Pacioli [...] uses Per (Latin for [...] "from") for the debtor and A (Latin for [...] "to") for the creditor in the Journal entries. Sherman {{goes on to say that}} the earliest text he found that actually uses [...] "Dr." [...] as an abbreviation in this context was an English text, the third edition (1633) of Ralph Handson's book Analysis or Resolution of Merchant Accompts and that Handson uses Dr. as an abbreviation for the English word [...] "debtor." [...] (Sherman could not locate a first edition, but speculates that it too used Dr. for debtor.) The words actually used by Pacioli for the left and right sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ledger</b> are [...] "in dare" [...] and [...] "in havere" [...] (give and receive). Geijsbeek the translator suggests in the preface: 'if we today would abolish the use of the words debit and credit in the ledger and substitute the ancient terms of [...] "shall give" [...] and [...] "shall have" [...] or [...] "shall receive," [...] the personification of accounts in the proper way would not be difficult and, with it, bookkeeping would become more intelligent to the proprietor, the layman and the student.' ...|$|E
