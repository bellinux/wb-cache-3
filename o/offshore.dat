5|$|A {{number of}} {{initiatives}} {{are working to}} reduce costs of electric power from <b>offshore</b> wind. One example is the Carbon Trust <b>Offshore</b> Wind Accelerator, a joint industry project, involving nine <b>offshore</b> wind developers, which aims {{to reduce the cost}} of <b>offshore</b> wind by 10% by 2015. It has been suggested that innovation at scale could deliver 25% cost reduction in <b>offshore</b> wind by 2020. Henrik Stiesdal, former Chief Technical Officer at Siemens Wind Power, has stated that by 2025 energy from <b>offshore</b> wind {{will be one of the}} cheapest, scalable solutions in the UK, compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources, if the true cost to society is factored into the cost of energy equation. He calculates the cost at that time to be 43 EUR/MWh for onshore, and 72 EUR/MWh for <b>offshore</b> wind.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{predict a}} pattern of <b>offshoring</b> and {{reshoring}} {{over the course of}} economic development. We achieve this, by extending Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg's (2008) model of <b>offshoring</b> in a simple way by assuming that <b>offshoring</b> requires both workers and capital in the <b>offshored</b> country. As a consequence, the accumulation of capital in the <b>offshored</b> country has two opposing effects on <b>offshoring.</b> On the one hand, it increases the wage rate of workers rendering <b>offshoring</b> less attractive. On the other hand, it decreases the rental price of capital rendering <b>offshoring</b> more attractive. Putting these two effects together, we analytically generate the inverted-U pattern of <b>offshoring</b> recently observed in China. ...|$|R
40|$|Using the Asian International Input-Output Table (1990, 1995, and 2000), {{this paper}} explores {{regional}} production networks and <b>offshoring</b> {{of material and}} service inputs in East Asia. In doing so, <b>offshoring</b> is measured directly from the Table, {{which has not been}} used in previous literature regarding this issue. It turns out that East Asian countries source significant shares of inputs within East Asia. In addition to material <b>offshoring,</b> service <b>offshoring</b> in East Asia has become increasingly common in the era of globalization. We also evaluate the effects of this fast growing <b>offshoring</b> on productivity. Our econometric results demonstrate that <b>offshoring</b> exerts a significant and positive impact on total factor productivity in East Asia. Service <b>offshoring,</b> in particular, performs a more significant role than material <b>offshoring.</b> Regional production networks Service <b>offshoring</b> Productivity...|$|R

This contribution formalizes service <b>offshoring</b> within a Ricardo-Viner specific factors model. As service <b>offshoring</b> is assumed to expand the range of possible <b>offshoring</b> scenar-ios, results {{differ from those of}} material <b>offshoring.</b> The different scenarios have opposite implications and sum up to marginal effects in the aggregate.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{services}} <b>offshoring</b> on wages using individual level data combined with industry information on <b>offshoring.</b> Our results show that services <b>offshoring</b> affects the real wage of low and medium skilled individuals negatively. By contrast, skilled workers benefit from services <b>offshoring</b> in terms of higher real wages. Hence, <b>offshoring</b> has contributed to a widening of the wage gap between skilled and less skilled workers. This result is obtained while controlling for individual and sectoral observed and unobserved heterogeneity.

40|$|<b>Offshoring</b> is {{generally}} {{believed to be}} productivity-enhancing and this belief is underpinned by economic theory. This article contributes to the growing literature that tests empirically whether <b>offshoring</b> does indeed help to improve productivity. Estimating the impact of materials and business services <b>offshoring</b> on productivity growth with industry-level data for Belgium over the period 1995 - 2004, we examine this issue separately for manufacturing and market services. The results {{show that there is}} no productivity effect of materials <b>offshoring,</b> while business services <b>offshoring</b> leads to productivity gains in manufacturing. In addition, this is the first article to investigate the possibility of spillovers from <b>offshoring.</b> Productivity gains from <b>offshoring</b> in one industry may feed through to other industries that purchase its output for intermediate use if, due to <b>offshoring,</b> the user value exceeds the price of the output. There is only scarce evidence of positive spillovers from materials <b>offshoring</b> in manufacturing in the data, which suggests that most firms effectively manage to internalise all efficiency gains from <b>offshoring.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
40|$|I {{present a}} model of <b>offshoring</b> {{decisions}} with heterogeneous firms, random adjustment costs, and endogenous markups.

40|$|Excerpt] Analysts of the <b>offshoring</b> {{phenomenon}} {{have expressed}} {{a range of}} views about the likely impacts of <b>offshoring</b> on four broad areas. The differing views reflect several factors: the fact that services <b>offshoring</b> is a relatively recent development whose impact is not fully known, the limitations of available data on <b>offshoring,</b> and different theoretical expectations about how services <b>offshoring</b> will impact the U.

40|$|<b>Offshoring</b> can {{be defined}} as the {{relocation}} of organizational tasks and services to foreign locations. Increasingly, firms experience that unforeseen costs and difficulties of managing <b>offshoring</b> undercut anticipated benefits; that unexpected challenges of <b>offshoring</b> jeopardize and eventually undermine initial objectives. Guided by the research question—what are the organizational consequences of offshoring?—the purpose of this thesis is to investigate why some firms fail when <b>offshoring</b> and other do not. The thesis consists of four research papers using various datasets and methodologies that investigate <b>offshoring</b> in an organizational context. The first paper investigates how the complexity of <b>offshoring</b> leads to ‘hidden costs’ of implementing <b>offshoring</b> activities. The second paper looks at how these hidden reconfiguration costs influence the process performance of the <b>offshored</b> activity and how this relationship is moderated by the modularity of that activity. The third paper investigates the effect of the organizational reconfiguration of <b>offshoring</b> on firms’ strategies. The final paper studies different strategies of adaptation in <b>offshoring.</b> Taken together, this thesis argues that whether firms relocate activities with the purpose of accessing resources or as a response to political pressures, the process of <b>offshoring</b> presents firms with the challenge of coordinating and integrating <b>offshoring</b> activities in a global organization. The complexities and uncertainties of an organization consisting of a number of <b>offshored</b> activities (in contrast to an organization with only co-located activities) require firms to invest additional resources in coordination mechanisms so that an efficient reintegration can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} {{effects of}} <b>offshoring</b> {{have been subject}} to extensive empirical analysis in the past, but many studies have not accurately distinguished between <b>offshoring,</b> domestic outsourcing, and the substitution of domestic by foreign suppliers. In this study I provide stylized facts on <b>offshoring</b> in Europe between 1995 and 2008 taking into account this distinction. I show that service inputs have been <b>offshored</b> and domestically outsourced, whereas material inputs have been either <b>offshored</b> or moved from domestic to foreign suppliers. The strong overall decline in the share of internal production evokes the question whether this has led to productivity gains within firms. I address this question by combining industry-level data on <b>offshoring</b> and domestic outsourcing with a firm panel. I find that <b>offshoring</b> of non-core activities has led to productivity gains whereas <b>offshoring</b> of core activities and domestic outsourcing have had no such effects. The estimated productivity gains are in particular driven by <b>offshoring</b> to low-wage countries and by the gains of multinational firms...|$|R

40|$|We {{set up a}} {{model of}} <b>offshoring</b> with {{heterogeneous}} producers that captures two empirical regularities on <b>offshoring</b> firms: larger, more productive firms {{are more likely to}} make use of the <b>offshoring</b> opportunity; the fraction of firms that engages in <b>offshoring</b> is positive and smaller than one in any size or revenue category. These patterns generate an overlap of <b>offshoring</b> and non-offshoring firms, which is non-monotonic in the costs of <b>offshoring.</b> In an empirical exercise, we employ firm-level data from Germany to estimate key parameters of the model. We show that ignoring the overlap leads to a severe downward bias in the estimated gains from <b>offshoring,</b> which amounts to almost 60 percent in our model...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{model of}} <b>offshoring,</b> which depicts <b>offshoring</b> as 'shadow migration,' permits {{straightforward}} derivation of necessary and sufficient {{conditions for the}} effects on wages, prices, production and trade.

We also show that <b>offshoring</b> is an independent source of comparative advantage {{and can lead to}} intra-industry trade in a Walrasian setting.

40|$|This paper investigates whether {{reshoring}} {{of business}} services {{is the result}} of company response to performance shortcomings of the initiative <b>offshored</b> or instead is motivated by persisting with original <b>offshoring</b> strategy (disintegration advantages, accessing new markets and cost-saving), regardless of <b>offshoring</b> performance. Our empirical analysis, based on data from the <b>Offshoring</b> Research Network, shows that both arguments hold. Moreover, when <b>offshoring</b> had been motivated by accessing to new markets and its performance is unsatisfactory, companies are likely to relocate. However, unsatisfactory performance of activities <b>offshored</b> for efficiency reasons or search of talent, do not necessarily lead companies to relocate elsewhere...|$|R
