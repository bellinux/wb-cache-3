40|$|Field methods {{based on}} the finite-difference approximations of the time-domain Maxwell's {{equations}} and the potential-flow equation {{have been developed to}} solve the multidisciplinary problem of airfoil shaping for aerodynamic efficiency and low radar cross section (RCS). A parametric study and an <b>optimization</b> <b>study</b> employing the two analysis methods are presented to illustrate their combined capabilities. The parametric study shows that for frontal radar illumination, the RCS of an airfoil is independent of the chordwise location of maximum thickness but depends strongly on the maximum thickness, leading-edge radius, and leadingedge shape. In addition, this study shows that the RCS of an airfoil can be reduced without significant effects on its transonic aerodynamic efficiency by reducing the leading-edge radius and/or modifying the shape of the leading edge. The <b>optimization</b> <b>study</b> involves the minimization of wave drag for a non-lifting, symmetrical airfoil with constraints on the airfoil maximum thickness and monostatic RCS.

40|$|A great {{advantage}} of some neutron sources, such as accelerator-produced sources, {{is that they}} can be tuned to produce different spectra. Unfortunately, <b>optimization</b> <b>studies</b> are often time-consuming and difficult, as they require a lengthy Monte Carlo simulation for each source. When multiple characteristics, such as energy, angle, and spatial distribution of a neutron beam are allowed to vary, an overwhelming number of simulations may be required. Many <b>optimization</b> <b>studies,</b> therefore, suffer from a small number of datapoints, restrictive treatment conditions, or poor statistics. By scoring pertinent information from every particle tally in a Monte Carlo simulation, then applying appropriate source variable weight factors in a post-processing algorithm, a single simulation can be used to model any number of multiple sources. Through this method, the response to a new source can be modeled in minutes or seconds, rather than hours or days, allowing for the analysis of truly variable source conditions of much greater resolution than is normally possible when a new simulation must be run for each datapoint in a study. This method has been benchmarked and used to recreate <b>optimization</b> <b>studies</b> in {{a small fraction of the}} time spent in the original studies...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present design <b>optimization</b> <b>studies</b> of complex fluid dynamic {{problems}} involving viscous, turbulent, multi-phase flow phenomena utilizing evolutionary algorithms. The shape optimization process {{is carried out}} by utilization of high fidelity CFD based comprehensive framework. The framework comprises of a genetic algorithm based design optimization procedure coupled to the hybrid unstructured CRUNCH CFD ® code and a grid generator. The genetic algorithm based optimization procedure is very robust, and searches the complex design landscape in an efficient and parallel manner. Furthermore, it can easily handle complexities in constraints and objectives and is disinclined to get trapped in local extrema regions. The fitness evaluations are carried out through a RANS based hybrid unstructured solver. The utilization of hybrid unstructured methodology provides flexibility in incorporating large changes in design and mesh regeneration is carried out in an automated manner through a scripting process within the grid generator GRIDGEN.
