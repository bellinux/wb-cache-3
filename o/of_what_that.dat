Begg stated that 'It is time to stop this cycle of uncontrolled rage and internecine violence that will only drive us to the pits of hell.

This is clear, in the first place, if we define what the true and the false are. To say <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is <b>that</b> it is not, or <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is not <b>that</b> it is, is false, while to say <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is <b>that</b> it is, and <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is not <b>that</b> it is not, is true; so that he who says of anything that it is, or that it is not, will say either what is true or what is false Aristotle ...|$|R

500|$|Selling England by the Pound {{has been}} praised by other songwriters and musicians. Rush drummer Neil Peart has said: [...] "I think Selling England by the Pound is an {{enduring}} masterpiece of drumming. Beautiful drumming, lovely sound, and the arrangements, I {{think they really}} nailed the best <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> band as an entity could have done with that album." [...] Fish, solo artist and former lead singer of Marillion, has called it [...] "the definitive Genesis album", praised its [...] "emotive" [...] quality, said the wordplay was [...] "one {{of the things that}} became quite an influence on me - the games within the lyrics" [...] and concluded it [...] "took a whole jump forward and was the album that really got me into Genesis". Singer and songwriter Robert Pollard of Guided by Voices considers Selling England by the Pound one of his ten favourite records of all time. John Lennon said he really liked the album during a radio interview, which the band took great encouragement from.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Michael's birth, {{the family}} moved to Wetherden in Suffolk. Michael's {{education}} began in 1909, with a nursery governess and various private tutors who followed a [...] curriculum that included piano lessons—his first formal contact with music. There was a piano in the house, on which he [...] "took to improvising crazily... which I called 'composing', though I had only the vaguest notion <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> meant". In September 1914 Michael became a boarder at Brookfield Preparatory School in Swanage, Dorset. He spent four years there, at one point earning notoriety by writing an essay that challenged the existence of God. In 1918 he won a scholarship to Fettes College, a boarding school in Edinburgh, where he studied the piano, sang in the choir, and began to learn to play the pipe organ. The school was not a happy place; sadistic bullying of the younger pupils was commonplace. When Michael revealed to his parents in March 1920 that he had formed a homosexual relationship with another boy, they removed him. He transferred to Stamford School in Lincolnshire, where a decade previously Malcolm Sargent had been a pupil.|$|E
500|$|Hazlitt's {{essay on}} Hamlet was later used by David Bromwich in an {{extensive}} comparison of Coleridge's and Hazlitt's critical views in general. Although, to Bromwich, Coleridge's criticism of Hamlet contained {{a greater number}} of original ideas, including the general assessment of Prince Hamlet's character, Hazlitt's view is notable in that it does not, like Coleridge, reduce that character to a single dominating flaw, his inability to act. In one of his lectures on Shakespeare, Coleridge claimed that [...] "Shakespeare wished to impress upon us the truth that action is the chief end of existence—that no faculties of intellect, however brilliant, can be considered valuable, or indeed otherwise than as misfortunes, if they withdraw us from or render us repugnant to action, and lead us to think and think of doing, until the time has elapsed when we can do anything effectually." [...] Hazlitt, on the other hand, instead of applying this moral, pointed to the necessity of each reader's identifying with Hamlet to understand him (which, he believed, occurred more readily than with any other of Shakespeare's characters) and the reader's judging of Hamlet in part on the basis <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> reader then saw in himself. This made it unlikely that Hamlet's entire character would be reduced to a single flaw that would provide the reader with a moral lesson.|$|E

500|$|Kahn {{said that}} the entire idea for the video was Brown's: [...] "It's an {{interesting}} video for me, because it's so rare that music videos ever try to achieve anything emotional. Chris just basically {{told me a story}} of what he felt this video was going to be, with his heart glowing and how he's, like, cold. It is a very personal story. But it's told in such a graphic manner that I {{fell in love with the}} idea. It's Chris' story. Period. I am the pencil that put it down on the paper." [...] When comparing the song's video to that of [...] "I Can Transform Ya", the director said, [...] "'Crawl' is my favorite one, because — gosh, I'm going to let you in on this — 'cause it's probably his most personal thing he's ever done." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I mean, everything that's happened to him in the year, I think this is going to be his big statement, in terms of what he's feeling and what he's living through right now." [...] When talking about the ideas and concepts of the video, Kahn {{said that the}} video, his first ballad with Brown, should speak for itself through the ideas that he had and the [...] "genesis" [...] <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> idea was.|$|E
500|$|When Chapter 27 premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, {{the film}} was debated {{fiercely}} by critics. A website reported, [...] "the audience's reactions made it obvious that some people would love it and others would not." [...] Andrew O'Hehir from Salon wrote, [...] "Some viewers may well find Chapter 27 sleazy or distasteful, and I won't argue the point. But Schaefer's movie creates its own highly compelling world, which {{is pretty much the}} prime directive in filmmaking." [...] He stated that [...] "Leto almost makes you feel how it happened," [...] and called his acting a [...] "highly compelling performance on many levels." [...] He also enjoyed Lohan's performance. Duane Byrge of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Chapter 27 is a smart attempt to distill the twisted psychology and motivation of Mark David Chapman, which we've all superficially gleaned through mass-media reports and intermittent updates on Chapman's incarceration." [...] He praised Leto's acting saying, [...] "Jared Leto is mesmeric as the bloated, deranged Chapman. It's a brilliantly measured performance, evincing the tale of a madman through his own awful rhyme and reason." [...] He also praised Schaefer's direction, the other cast and crew. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars saying, [...] "By the end of this modest, strange venture, Leto made me believe it was worth being forced to hang out on the sidewalk with this man, if only to get a creeping sense <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> might've been like." ...|$|E
500|$|Gareth McLean of the Radio Times {{said that}} Lewis {{was a gentleman}} escort and he deemed him a [...] "suave companion." [...] A {{spokeswoman}} for the show said, [...] "There is no suggestion that Lewis is {{anything more than a}} companion escort for his clients." [...] A writer for the Metro described Lewis as [...] "charming" [...] and [...] "charismatic", and a reporter from the Daily Record wrote that he was [...] "Weatherfield's answer to American Gigolo." [...] The soap's official website lists [...] "ungallant behaviour" [...] as something Lewis dislikes. Havers believed Lewis would eventually display [...] "a real dark side", though he was unaware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> could be. Lewis is first seen accompanying Claudia Colby (Rula Lenska) to a Christmas ball. He is introduced by Audrey Roberts; Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly stated that she was [...] "immediately bowled over by his charming ways." [...] Claudia informs Audrey that she booked Lewis through an agency and Audrey decides to hire Lewis to be her companion to another event. Lewis goes to the Rovers Return Inn and pretends not to know Audrey. He then proceeds to chat her up in front of her friends, causing them to wonder how she attracted him. Havers thought the scenes were funny and called the storyline between Lewis and Audrey [...] "fantastic". In March 2010, Lewis was seen advertising his escort service in society magazine, The Lady. A reporter for The Belfast Telegraph revealed the character's classified advert would be seen in the real life magazine in a crossover with the show. A spokeswoman for Coronation Street stated [...] "The Lady heard the magazine was going to feature in an episode, and they approached us with the idea of using the advert in the actual magazine." [...] In the advert, Lewis claims to have [...] "years of experience" [...] and is [...] "suitable to accompany ladies in any social or corporate event". On screen, Audrey's friend Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) notices the advert and books Lewis for a date.|$|E
