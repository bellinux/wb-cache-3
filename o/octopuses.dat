5|$|<b>Octopuses</b> {{are highly}} intelligent, but {{the extent of}} their {{intelligence}} and learning capability are not well defined. Maze and problem-solving experiments have shown evidence of a memory system that can store both short- and long-term memory. It is not known precisely what contribution learning makes to adult octopus behaviour. Young <b>octopuses</b> learn nothing from their parents, as adults provide no parental care beyond tending to their eggs until the young <b>octopuses</b> hatch.|$|E
5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, <b>octopuses</b> can {{be readily}} trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns. They {{have been reported to}} practise observational learning, although the validity of these findings is contested. <b>Octopuses</b> have also been observed in what has been described as play: repeatedly releasing bottles or toys into a circular current in their aquariums and then catching them. <b>Octopuses</b> often break out of their aquariums and sometimes into others in search of food. They have even boarded fishing boats and opened holds to eat crabs. The veined octopus collects discarded coconut shells, then uses them to build a shelter, an example of tool use.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all <b>octopuses</b> are predatory; bottom-dwelling <b>octopuses</b> eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, {{and other}} {{molluscs}} such as whelks and clams; open-ocean <b>octopuses</b> eat mainly prawns, {{fish and other}} cephalopods. Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include bivalve molluscs such as the cockle Clinocardium nuttallii, clams and scallops, and crustaceans such as crabs and spider crabs. Prey that {{it is likely to}} reject include moon snails, because they are too large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, because they are too securely fixed to the rock.|$|E
50|$|The {{aquaculture}} {{potential of}} several <b>octopus</b> species {{has been investigated}} in recent years, including <b>Octopus</b> maya, <b>Octopus</b> bimaculoides, <b>Octopus</b> ocellatus, and <b>Octopus</b> mimus.|$|R
50|$|The common <b>octopus</b> (<b>Octopus</b> vulgaris) is a mollusc {{belonging}} to the class Cephalopoda. <b>Octopus</b> vulgaris is the most studied of all <b>octopus</b> species.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} nakji bokkeum {{date back to}} the 19th century, where <b>octopus</b> was either {{consumed}} raw, dried, or pan-fried. Dishes such as nakjisukhoe (leached <b>octopus)</b> and nakjibaeksuk (boiled <b>octopus)</b> were served during the 20th century, with <b>octopus</b> being consumed more frequently and proven to have health benefits, dishes with <b>octopus</b> were being developed such as yeonpotang (pellucid <b>octopus</b> soup) and nakji-bibimbap (mixed rice with <b>octopus</b> and vegetables).|$|R
5|$|Octopus {{fisheries}} exist {{around the}} world with total catches varying between 245,320 and 322,999 metric tons from 1986 to 1995. The world catch peaked in 2007 at 380,000 tons, and fell by a tenth by 2012. Methods to capture <b>octopuses</b> include pots, traps, trawls, snares, drift fishing, spearing, hooking and hand collection. Octopus is eaten in many cultures and is a common food on the Mediterranean and Asian coasts. The arms and sometimes other body parts are prepared in various ways, often varying by species or geography. Live <b>octopuses</b> are eaten in several countries {{around the world}}, including the US. Animal welfare groups have objected to this practice on the basis that <b>octopuses</b> can experience pain. <b>Octopuses</b> have a food conversion efficiency greater than that of chickens, making octopus aquaculture a possibility.|$|E
5|$|<b>Octopuses</b> have {{a closed}} circulatory system, where the blood remains inside blood vessels. <b>Octopuses</b> have three hearts; a {{systemic}} heart that circulates blood round {{the body and}} two branchial hearts that pump it through {{each of the two}} gills. The systemic heart is inactive when the animal is swimming and thus it tires quickly and prefers to crawl.|$|E
5|$|Strategies {{to defend}} {{themselves}} against predators include the expulsion of ink, the use of camouflage and threat displays, their ability to jet quickly through the water, {{and their ability to}} hide. All <b>octopuses</b> are venomous, but only the blue-ringed <b>octopuses</b> are known to be deadly to humans.|$|E

5|$|When under attack, some <b>octopuses</b> {{can perform}} arm autotomy, {{in a manner}} similar to the way skinks and other lizards detach their tails. The {{crawling}} arm may distract would-be predators. Such severed arms remain sensitive to stimuli and move away from unpleasant sensations. <b>Octopuses</b> can replace lost limbs.|$|E
5|$|All <b>octopuses</b> are venomous, {{but only}} a few species pose a {{significant}} threat to humans. Blue-ringed <b>octopuses</b> in the genus Hapalochlaena, which live around Australia and New Guinea, bite humans only if severely provoked, but their venom kills 25% of human victims. Another tropical species, Octopus apollyon, causes severe inflammation that can last for over a month even if treated correctly, and the bite of Octopus rubescens can cause necrosis that lasts longer than one month if untreated, and headaches and weakness persisting for up to a week even if treated.|$|E
5|$|Deimatic display {{occurs in}} widely {{separated}} groups of animals, including moths, butterflies, mantises and phasmids among the insects. In the cephalopods, {{different species of}} <b>octopuses,</b> squids, cuttlefish and the paper nautilus are deimatic.|$|E

5|$|Most young <b>octopuses</b> hatch as paralarvae and are planktonic {{for weeks}} to months, {{depending}} on the species and water temperature. They feed on copepods, arthropod larvae and other zooplankton, eventually settling {{on the ocean floor}} and developing directly into adults with no distinct metamorphoses that are present in other groups of mollusc larvae. Octopus species that produce larger eggs – including the southern blue-ringed, Caribbean reef, California two-spot, Eledone moschata and deep sea <b>octopuses</b> – do not have a paralarval stage, but hatch as benthic animals similar to the adults.|$|E
5|$|<b>Octopuses</b> {{appear in}} mythology as sea monsters like the Kraken of Norway and the Akkorokamui of the Ainu, and {{probably}} the Gorgon of ancient Greece. A battle with an octopus appears in Victor Hugo's book Toilers of the Sea, inspiring other works such as Ian Fleming's Octopussy. <b>Octopuses</b> appear in Japanese erotic art, shunga. They are eaten by humans {{in many parts of}} the world, especially the Mediterranean and the Asian seas.|$|E
5|$|<b>Octopuses</b> offer many {{possibilities}} in biological research, including {{their ability to}} regenerate limbs, change the colour of their skin, behave intelligently with a distributed nervous system, and make use of 168 kinds of protocadherins (humans have 58), the proteins that guide the connections neurons make with each other. The California two-spot octopus has had its genome sequenced, allowing exploration of its molecular adaptations. Having independently evolved mammal-like intelligence, <b>octopuses</b> have been compared to hypothetical intelligent extraterrestrials. Their problem-solving skills, along with their mobility and lack of rigid structure enable them to escape from supposedly secure tanks in laboratories and public aquariums.|$|E

50|$|The curled <b>octopus</b> (Eledone cirrhosa), {{also known}} as the horned <b>octopus,</b> lesser <b>octopus</b> or {{northern}} <b>octopus,</b> is a species of cephalopod found in the northeast Atlantic, ranging from Norway to the Mediterranean, including the British Isles.|$|R
5|$|<b>Octopuses</b> use {{camouflage}} when hunting, and {{to avoid}} predators. To do this they use specialised skin cells which change {{the appearance of the}} skin by adjusting its colour, opacity, or reflectivity. Chromatophores contain yellow, orange, red, brown, or black pigments; most species have three of these colours, while some have two or four. Other colour-changing cells are reflective iridophores and white leucophores. This colour-changing ability is also used to communicate with or warn other <b>octopuses.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some <b>octopuses,</b> such as {{the mimic}} octopus, can combine their highly {{flexible}} bodies with their colour-changing ability to mimic other, more dangerous animals, such as lionfish, sea snakes, and eels.|$|E

5|$|The {{diseases}} and parasites that affect <b>octopuses</b> have been little studied, but cephalopods {{are known to}} be the intermediate or final hosts of various parasitic cestodes, nematodes and copepods; 150 species of protistan and metazoan parasites have been recognised. The Dicyemidae are a family of tiny worms that are found in the renal appendages of many species; it is unclear whether they are parasitic or are endosymbionts. Coccidians in the genusAggregata living in the gut cause severe disease to the host. <b>Octopuses</b> have an innate immune system, and the haemocytes respond to infection by phagocytosis, encapsulation, infiltration or cytotoxic activities to destroy or isolate the pathogens. The haemocytes {{play an important role in}} the recognition and elimination of foreign bodies and wound repair. Captive animals have been found to be more susceptible to pathogens than wild ones. A gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio lentus, has been found to cause skin lesions, exposure of muscle and death of <b>octopuses</b> in extreme cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} name Octopoda was first coined and given as {{the order of}} <b>octopuses</b> in 1818 by English biologist William Elford Leach, who classified them as Octopoida the previous year. The Octopoda consists of 300 known species and {{can be divided into}} two suborders, the Incirrina and the Cirrina. The incirrate <b>octopuses</b> (the majority of species) lack the cirri and paired swimming fins of the cirrates. In addition, the internal shell of incirrates is either present as a pair of stylets or absent altogether.|$|E
5|$|All {{species are}} venomous, but only blue-ringed <b>octopuses</b> have venom that is lethal to humans. Bites are {{reported}} each year across the animals' range from Australia {{to the eastern}} Indo-Pacific Ocean. They bite only when provoked or accidentally stepped upon; bites are small and usually painless. The venom appears {{to be able to}} penetrate the skin without a puncture, given prolonged contact. It contains tetrodotoxin, which causes paralysis by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles. This causes death by respiratory failure leading to cerebral anoxia. No antidote is known, but if breathing can be kept going artificially, patients recover within 24 hours. Bites have been recorded from captive <b>octopuses</b> of other species; they leave swellings which disappear in a day or two.|$|E
