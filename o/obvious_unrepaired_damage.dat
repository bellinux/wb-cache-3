At least two mechanisms ensure such tolerance: template switching and lesion 1. A A bypass. Lesion bypass, whereby <b>unrepaired</b> <b>damaged</b> DNA serves as template, involves the Y family of DNA polymerases; lesion bypass can be error-free or error-prone, depending on the nucleotide incorporated during translesion synthesis. Error-prone lesion bypass constitutes a major mechanism of mutagenesis and, in eukaryotes, is primarily effected by the DNA polymerase � (Pol�) pathway. A relationship between the Y family polymerases and the Pol� pathway is thus implicated, and conforms to the two-polymerase two-step model of lesion bypass.

40|$|Damage {{recognition}} by repair/checkpoint factors {{is the critical}} first step of the DNA damage response. DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) activate checkpoint signaling and are repaired by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) pathways. However, in vivo kinetics of the individual factor responses and the mechanism of pathway choice are not well understood. We report cell cycle and time course analyses of checkpoint activation by ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and damage site recruitment of the repair factors in response to laserinduced DSBs. We found that MRN acts as a DNA damage marker, continuously localizing at <b>unrepaired</b> <b>damage</b> sites. Damage {{recognition by}} NHEJ factors precedes that of HR factors.

5|$|Given these {{properties}} of DNA damage and mutation, {{it can be}} seen that DNA damage is a special problem in non-dividing or slowly-dividing cells, where <b>unrepaired</b> <b>damage</b> will tend to accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly-dividing cells, <b>unrepaired</b> DNA <b>damage</b> that does not kill the cell by blocking replication will tend to cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell's survival. Thus, in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells will tend to be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will tend to clonally expand at the expense of neighboring cells in the tissue. This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism, because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer. Thus, DNA damage in frequently dividing cells, because it gives rise to mutations, is a prominent cause of cancer. In contrast, DNA damage in infrequently-dividing cells is likely a prominent cause of aging.|$|R

50|$|The two gray-highlighted genes RAD51 and BRCA2, are {{required}} for homologous recombinational repair. They are sometimes epigenetically over-expressed and sometimes under-expressed in certain cancers.

These repair deficiencies would likely cause increased <b>unrepaired</b> DNA <b>damages.</b> The over-expression of RAD51 and BRCA2 seen in these cancers may reflect selective pressures for compensatory RAD51 or BRCA2 over-expression and increased homologous recombinational repair to at least partially deal with such excess DNA damages. In those cases where RAD51 or BRCA2 are under-expressed, this would itself lead to increased <b>unrepaired</b> DNA <b>damages.</b> Replication errors past these damages (see translesion synthesis) could cause increased mutations and cancer, so that under-expression of RAD51 or BRCA2 would be carcinogenic in itself.|$|R

Data from the DS mouse model, Ts 65 Dn, reveal low incidence of solid tumors consistent with clinical observations.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND:The FA/BRCA pathway repairs DNA interstrand crosslinks. Mutations in this pathway cause Fanconi anemia (FA), a {{chromosome}} instability syndrome with bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition. Upon DNA damage, normal and FA cells inhibit the cell cycle progression, until the G 2 /M checkpoint is {{turned off by the}} checkpoint recovery, which becomes activated when the DNA damage has been repaired. Interestingly, highly damaged FA cells seem to override the G 2 /M checkpoint. In this study we explored with a Boolean network model and key experiments whether checkpoint recovery activation occurs in FA cells with extensive <b>unrepaired</b> DNA <b>damage.</b> METHODS:We performed synchronous/asynchronous simulations of the FA/BRCA pathway Boolean network model. FA-A and normal lymphoblastoid cell lines were used to study checkpoint and checkpoint recovery activation after DNA damage induction. The experimental approach included flow cytometry cell cycle analysis, cell division tracking, chromosome aberration analysis and gene expression analysis through qRT-PCR and western blot. RESULTS:Computational simulations suggested that in FA mutants checkpoint recovery activity inhibits the checkpoint components despite <b>unrepaired</b> DNA <b>damage,</b> a behavior that we did not observed in wild-type simulations. This result implies that FA cells would eventually reenter the cell cycle after a DNA damage induced G 2 /M checkpoint arrest, but before the damage has been fixed. We observed that FA-A cells activate the G 2 /M checkpoint and arrest in G 2 phase, but eventually reach mitosis and divide with <b>unrepaired</b> DNA <b>damage,</b> thus resolving the initial checkpoint arrest. Based on our model result we look for ectopic activity of checkpoint recovery components. We found that checkpoint recovery components, such as PLK 1, are expressed to a similar extent as normal undamaged cells do, even though FA-A cells harbor highly damaged DNA. CONCLUSIONS:Our results show that FA cells, despite extensive DNA damage, do not loss the capacity to express the transcriptional and protein components of checkpoint recovery that might eventually allow their division with <b>unrepaired</b> DNA <b>damage.</b> This might allow cell survival but increases the genomic instability inherent to FA individuals and promotes cancer...|$|R

Given the well-established involvement of DDR during tumorigenesis and cancer therapy, the ability to monitor these repair processes non-invasively using nuclear imaging techniques may facilitate the earlier detection of cancer and may also assist in monitoring response to DNA damaging treatment.

40|$|The APNI gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes {{the major}} apurinic/apyrimidinic {{endonuclease}} and 3 '-repair DNA diesterase in yeast cell extracts. The Apnl protein is a homolog ofEscherichia coli endonuclease IV, which {{functions in the}} repair ofsome oxidative and alkylation damages in that organism. We show here that yeast strains lacking Apnl (generated by targeted gene disruption or deletion-replacement) are hypersensitive to both oxidative (hydrogen peroxide and t-butylhydroperoxide) and alkylating (methyl- and ethylmethane sulfonate) agents that damage DNA. These cellular hypersensitivities are correlated with the accumulation of <b>unrepaired</b> <b>damages</b> in the chromosomal DNA of apnl mutant yeast cells. Hydrogen peroxide-treated APNI+ but not apnl mutant cells regenerate high-molecular-weight DNA efficiently after the treatment. The DNA strand breaks that accumulate in the Apnl-deficient mutant contain lesions that block the action of DNA polymerase but can be removed in vitro by purified Apnl. An analogous result with DNA from methylmethane sulfonate-treated cells corresponded to the accumulation of unrepaired DNA apurinic sites in the apnl mutant cells. The rate of spontaneous mutation in apnl mutant S. cerevisiae was 6 - to 12 -fold higher than that measured for wild-type yeast cells. This increase indicates that under normal growth conditions, the production of DNA damages that are targets for Apnl is substantial and that such lesions can be mutagenic when left <b>unrepaired.</b> Cellular DNA <b>damage</b> arises from hydrolytic reactions...|$|R
