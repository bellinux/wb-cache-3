5|$|Ireland King <b>of</b> <b>Arms</b> was {{the title}} of an officer <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> to the King of England and Lord of Ireland from 1392 until the {{accession}} of Henry VII as King of England in 1485. A king <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> is the highest of the three levels of officers <b>of</b> <b>arms,</b> and usually enjoys heraldic jurisdiction over a geographical area. Despite the name Ireland King <b>of</b> <b>Arms</b> {{did not appear to}} exercise heraldic authority in Ireland, and indeed the connection with Ireland seems rather tenuous. The office may have been created preparatory to a subsequently aborted military expedition to Ireland. The last holder of the office, Walter Bellinger, did exercise the heraldic prerogative of a king <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> to grant armorial bearings, however two of his grants were annulled or regranted by other kings <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> as they felt he encroached on their provinces. In 1552, 70 years after the last Ireland King <b>of</b> <b>Arms,</b> the office of Ulster King <b>of</b> <b>Arms</b> was created. The holders of this office exercised control over the heraldic affairs of Ireland until the death of its last incumbent, Neville Wilkinson, in 1941. Thereafter, heraldic affairs in Ireland were transferred to the Government of Ireland while the post was merged with that of Norroy King <b>of</b> <b>Arms</b> forming the present office of Norroy and Ulster King <b>of</b> <b>Arms.</b>|$|E

5|$|As of 2006, the Ecuadoran flag still shares some {{similarity}} {{with the}} flags of Colombia and Venezuela. All three flags use the yellow, {{blue and red}} tricolor, but {{that is where the}} similarities end. In a decree passed in Colombia in 1934, the ratio of the stripes were set at 2:1:1 and the flag ratio was set at 2:3, similar to the present Ecuador flag. However, the coat <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> is only changed {{in the middle of the}} flag when it is used by government officials or by military forces. For Venezuela, the basic design was to have all three strips even vertically, unlike those of Colombia and Ecuador. Since 1863, Venezuela decided to change their flag with white stars instead of a coat <b>of</b> <b>arms.</b> A coat <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> was not added to the national flag 1954, then changed again in 2006 to add another star and alter the coat <b>of</b> <b>arms.</b> The position of the coat <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> on the Venezuelan flag also differs from Ecuador and Colombia by placing the arms at the very top hoist (left) side of the flag instead of in the center.|$|E

40|$|Age-related maculopathy (<b>ARM)</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the leading}} causes of central visual acuity loss in older western population. Many factors are {{responsible}} for the fast development <b>of</b> <b>ARM.</b> One <b>of</b> this is significant increases of optical radiations through artificial lens after removal of the catarctous lens. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare progression <b>of</b> <b>ARM</b> in phakic and pseudophakic patients and to calculate the possibility of pseudophakia as a risk factor for faster progression <b>of</b> <b>ARM.</b> Medical records <b>of</b> 76 patients, older than 60 years (32 male and 44 female) with early forms <b>of</b> <b>ARM</b> were randomly evaluated. They had undergone cataract removal by phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation from January 2002 to December 2006 at the Department of Ophthalmology, Rijeka University Hospital, Croatia. Patients were examined two weeks after the surgery and followed up for two years. The control group consisted of 48 patients (21 males and 27 females) with also early forms <b>of</b> <b>ARM,</b> older than 60 years, examined at the Policlinic Department from January 2006 to December 2006 and followed up at least for two years without any cataract surgery. Comparing progression <b>of</b> <b>ARM</b> in these two groups, a total of 19 patients (25 %) in pseudophakic group showed progression to late forms <b>of</b> <b>ARM,</b> but only 6 patients (12. 5 %) in the control group developed these aggressive ARM forms.

40|$|Between 2001 and 2005, JALSG {{conducted}} a randomized study {{to assess the}} optimal post remission therapy for adult AML in the first CR. JALSG AML 201 enrolled 1064 previously untreated AML patients (pts) aged 15 - 64 yrs. The induction therapy consisted of cytarabine (Ara-C 100 mg/m 2 day 1 - 7) and idarubicin (IDR 12 mg/m 2 day 1 - 3) (arm A) or cytarabine (100 mg/m 2 day 1 - 7) and daunorubicin (DNR 50 mg/m 2 day 1 - 5) (arm B). If the patients did not achieve remission after the first induction therapy, then the same therapy was given once more. Pts were categorized into good, intermediate or poor risk groups by risk factors based on the criteria established in previous JALSG AML studies. All CR pts were stratified according to the induction, the number of courses of induction, age and karyotype and {{were randomly assigned to}} the high dose Ara-C (HDAC) post remission regimen (arm C) or the conventional JALSG post remission regimen (arm D). Arm C: the three courses of HDAC which consisted of Ara-C 2. 0 g/m 2 q 12 h day 1 - 5, arm D: the first course consisted of Ara-C 200 mg/m 2 day 1 - 5 + mitoxantrone (MIT) 7 mg/m 2 day 1 - 3, 2) Ara-C 200 mg/m 2 day 1 - 5 + DNR 50 mg/m 2 day 1 - 3, 3) Ara-C 200 mg/m 2 day 1 - 5 + aclarubicin (ACR) 20 mg/m 2 day 1 - 5, 4) Ara-C 200 mg/m 2 day 1 - 5 + etoposide (ETP) 100 mg/m 2 day 1 - 5 + vincristine (VCR) 0. 8 mg/m 2 day 8 + vindesine (VDS) 2 mg/m 2 day 10. Results: Of the 1064 pts registered, 1057 pts (median age: 47 years) were evaluable. 825 pts (78 %) achieved CR after one or two courses of induction therapy. Of the 825 pts in CR, 781 pts were assigned to arm C or arm D. The 4 -year OS rate <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> C was 61. 6 % while that <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> D was 62. 8 % (p= 0. 58). The 4 -year RFS rate of the CR patients was 42. 8 % in arm C and 40. 8 % in arm D (p= 0. 65). Among the good risk group, the 4 -year OS rate <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> C was 77. 0 % while that <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> D was 75. 8 % (p= 0. 40), and the 4 -year RFS rate <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> C was 54. 6 % while that <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> D was 53. 1 % (p= 0. 71). Among the intermediate risk group, the 4 -year OS rate <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> C was 63. 2 % while that <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> D was 65. 7 % (p= 0. 78), and the 4 -year RFS rate <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> C was 38. 7 % while that <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> D was 42. 2 % (p= 0. 63). Among the poor risk group, the 4 -year OS rate <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> C was 36. 3 % while that <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> D was 34. 1 % (p= 0. 71), and the 4 -year RFS rate <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> C was 25. 9 % while that <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> D was 6. 6 % (p= 0. 17). In the CBF leukemia group, the 4 -year OS rate <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> C was 79. 4 % while that <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> D was 66. 5 % (p= 0. 09), and the 4 -year RFS rate <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> C was 57. 7 % while that <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> D was 43. 7 % (p= 0. 14). Among the young group (= 50 yrs), the 4 -year OS rate <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> C was 53. 4 % while that <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> D was 57. 7 % (p= 0. 90), and the 4 -year RFS rate <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> C was 39. 1 % while that <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> D was 33. 8 % (p= 0. 67). Conclusion: The conventional post remission therapeutic regimen established by JALSG consisting of 4 courses of consolidation was thus found to be as effective as the three courses of HDAC therapy. To further confirm these results, a longer follow-up is therefore needed...|$|R
