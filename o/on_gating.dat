40|$|Opening of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) {{channels}} is {{facilitated by}} direct binding of cyclic nucleotides to a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) in the C-terminus. Here, we {{show for the}} first time that in the HCN 2 channel cGMP can also exert an inhibitory effect <b>on</b> <b>gating</b> via cGMP-dependent protein kinase II (cGKII) -mediated phosphorylation. Using coimmunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry we demonstrate that cGKII and HCN 2 interact and colocalize with each other upon heterologous expression as well as in native mouse brain. We identify the proximal C-terminus of HCN 2 as binding region of cGKII and show that cGKII phosphorylates HCN 2 at a specific serine residue (S 641) in the C-terminal end of the CNBD. The cGKII shifts the voltage-dependence of HCN 2 activation to 2 - 5 mV more negative voltages and, hence, counteracts the stimulatory effect of cGMP <b>on</b> <b>gating.</b> The inhibitory cGMP effect can be either abolished by mutation of the phosphorylation site in HCN 2 or by impairing the catalytic domain of cGKII. By contrast, the inhibitory effect is preserved in a HCN 2 mutant carrying a CNBD deficient for cGMP binding. Our data suggest that bidirectional regulation of HCN 2 gating by cGMP contributes to cellular fine-tuning of HCN channel activity. ...|$|E

For values of the parameter characterizing membrane electrostriction in the range suggested by optical retardation studies of Cohen et al. (1971), the nonlinear current of electrostrictive origin is comparable in magnitude and time-course, but is opposite in direction to the observed gating currents. Hence, the a priori neglect of electrostrictive currents is probably not justified.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of Zn ion on Na channels was studied in squid giant axons. At {{a concentration of}} 30 mM Zn 2 + slows opening kinetics of Na channels with almost no alteration of closing kinetics. The effects of Zn 2 + can be expressed as a "shift" of the gating parameters along the voltage axis, i. e., the amount of additional depolarization required to overcome the Zn 2 + effect. In these terms the mean shifts caused by 30 mM Zn 2 + were + 29. 5 mV for Na channel opening (on) kinetics (t 1 / 2 on), + 2 mV for closing (off) kinetics (tau off), and + 8. 4 mV for the gNa-V curve.

40|$|ClC- 0 is a {{chloride}} channel whose gating {{is sensitive}} to both voltage and chloride. Based on analysis of gating kinetics using single-channel recordings, a five-state model was proposed to describe the dependence of ClC- 0 fast-gate opening on voltage and external chloride (Chen, T. -Y., and C. Miller. 1996. J. Gen. Physiol. 108 : 237 – 250). We aimed to use this five-state model {{as a starting point}} for understanding the structural changes that occur during gating. Using macroscopic patch recordings, we were able to reproduce the effects of voltage and chloride that were reported by Chen and Miller and to fit our opening rate constant data to the five-state model. Upon further analysis of both our data and those of Chen and Miller, we learned that in contrast to their conclusions, (a) the features in the data are not adequate to rule out a simpler four-state model, and (b) the chloride-binding step is voltage dependent. In order to be able to evaluate the effects of mutants <b>on</b> <b>gating</b> (described in the companion paper, see Engh et al. on p. 351 of this issue), we developed a method for determining the error <b>on</b> <b>gating</b> model parameters, and evaluated the sources of this error. To begin to mesh the kinetic model(s) with the known CLC structures, a model of ClC- 0 was generated computationally based on the X-ray crystal structure of the prokaryotic homolog ClC-ec 1. Analysis of pore electrostatics in this homology model suggests that at least two of the conclusions derived from the gating kinetics analysis are consistent with the known CLC structures: (1) chloride binding is necessary for channel opening, and (2) chloride binding to any of the three known chloride-binding sites must be voltage dependent...|$|E
40|$|Most power {{reduction}} {{techniques have}} focused <b>on</b> <b>gating</b> {{the clock to}} unused functional units to minimize static power consumption, while system level optimizations {{have been used to}} deal with dynamic power consumption. Once these techniques are applied, register file power consumption becomes a domi-nant factor in the processor. This paper proposes a power-aware reconfigura-tion mechanism in the register file driven by a compiler. Optimal usage of the register file in terms of size is achieved and unused registers are put into a low-power state. Total energy consumption in the register file is reduced by 65 % with no appreciable performance penalty for MiBench benchmarks on an embedded processor. The effect of reconfiguration granularity on energy savings is also analyzed, and the compiler approach to optimize energy results is presented.

40|$|ABSTRACT The cardiac dihydropyridine-sensitive {{calcium channel}} was transiently {{expressed}} in HEK 293 cells by transfecting the rabbit cardiac calcium channel al subunit (alc) {{alone or in}} combination with the rabbit calcium channel 13 subunit cloned from skeletal muscle. Transfection with ~ 1 c alone leads to the expression of inward, voltage-activated, calcium or barium currents that exhibit dihydropyridine sensitivity and voltage- as well as calcium-dependent inactivation. Coexpression of the skeletal muscle [3 subunit increases current density and the number of highaffinity dihydropyridine binding sites and also affects the macroscopic kinetics of the current. Recombinant ~lc[3 channels exhibit a slowing of activation and a faster inactivation rate when either calcium or barium carries the charge. Our data suggest that both {{an increase in the number}} of channels as well as modulatory effects <b>on</b> <b>gating</b> underlie the modifications observed upon [3 subunit coexpression...|$|E

40|$|The flow of ions through {{membrane}} channels {{is precisely}} regulated by gates. The architecture {{and function of}} these elements have been studied extensively, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying gating. Recent investigations have focused on ion occupancy of the channel’s selectivity filter {{and its ability to}} alter gating, with most studies involving prokaryotic K+ channels. Some studies used large quaternary ammonium blocker molecules {{to examine the effects of}} altered ionic flux <b>on</b> <b>gating.</b> However, the absence of blocking events that are visibly distinct from closing events in K+ channels makes unambiguous interpretation of data from single channel recordings difficult. In this study, the large K+ conductance of the RyR 2 channel permits direct observation of blocking events as distinct subconductance states and for the first time demonstrates the differential effects of blocker molecules on channel gating. This experimental platform provides valuable insights into mechanisms of blocker-induced modulation of ion channel gating...|$|E
40|$|MscL is a mechanosensitive {{channel of}} large {{conductance}} that functions as an “emergency release valve,” allowing bacteria to survive acute hypoosmotic stress. Although Escherichia coli MscL is the best-studied mechanosensitive channel, structural rearrangements occurring during gating remain disputed. Introduction of a charged residue into the pore of MscL {{was shown to}} result in a reduced-viability phenotype. Here, we probe for residues in the transmembrane domains that are exposed to the aqueous environment in the presence and absence of hypoosmotic shock by reacting a charged sulfhydryl reagent with substituted cysteines. Subsequent analysis of cell viability allows for an assessment of residues exposed in the closed and opening states in vivo. The results suggest that the crystal structure of MscL derived from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis orthologue may reflect a nearly closed rather than fully closed state and support a clockwise rotation of the pore-forming first transmembrane domain <b>on</b> <b>gating...</b>|$|E

By fitting our data to the previously proposed four-state model for ClC- 0 fast gating, we show which steps in fast-gate opening are likely to be affected by these mutations. Computational analysis of mutant ClC- 0 homology models show electrostatic contributions to chloride binding that may partially account for the effects of K 149 <b>on</b> <b>gating.</b> The analysis of gating kinetics in combination with the available structural information suggests some of the structural changes likely to underpin fast-gate opening...|$|E
