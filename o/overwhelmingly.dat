5|$|The 1903 {{revision}} of the Westminster Confession eventually led {{a large number of}} congregations from the Arminian–leaning Cumberland Presbyterian Church to reunite with the PCUSA in 1906. While <b>overwhelmingly</b> approved, the reunion caused controversy within the PCUSA due to concerns over doctrinal compatibility and racial segregation in the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Warfield was a strong critic of the merger on doctrinal grounds. Northern Presbyterians, such as Francis James Grimké and Herrick Johnson, objected to the creation of racially segregated presbyteries in the South, a concession demanded by the Cumberland Presbyterians as the price for reunion. Despite these objections, the merger was <b>overwhelmingly</b> approved.|$|E

5|$|A poorly educated but {{politically}} astute lawyer, Taylor began {{climbing the}} political ladder by holding local offices {{in his native}} Butler County. Though he was a Republican in an <b>overwhelmingly</b> Democratic state, divisions in the majority party resulted in his election as Attorney General of Kentucky on a ticket with the Commonwealth's first Republican governor, William O. Bradley. Four years later, Taylor was elected in 1899 to the governorship.|$|E
5|$|According to a late 2012 Bertelsmann Foundation Poll, the Germans view Japan <b>overwhelmingly</b> positively, and regard {{that nation}} as less a {{competitor}} {{and more a}} partner.

Throughout its path, 43fatalities and about $325.74million in damage {{were attributed to}} Carla. Most of the impact occurred in Texas, where the storm made landfall as a large and strong Category4 hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Press {{coverage}} of the concept XJ220 in 1988 was <b>overwhelmingly</b> positive {{and contributed to the}} decision in 1989 to put the XJ220 into limited production.

5|$|The first {{assemblies}} of the Republic {{emerged during}} the Kingdom, with their use to ratify regal elections and the repurposing of the comitia centuriata to elect the first consuls. This regime was dominated by the patricians, and the sources on the early Republic <b>overwhelmingly</b> focus on the conflicts between the patricians and the plebs, in {{what is known as}} the Conflict of the Orders.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Gaza is <b>overwhelmingly</b> composed of Muslims, who mostly follow Sunni Islam.

5|$|These {{extension}} {{plans were}} {{rejected by the}} government in 2004, due to escalating costs.

5|$|U.S. President Abraham Lincoln {{diverted}} several regiments of militia {{and volunteer}} troops after the Battle of Gettysburg {{to control the}} city.

It persists in being recognised {{as one of the best}} Austen adaptations of all time.|$|E
5|$|A {{field study}} {{carried out at}} Jandakot Airport south of Perth and {{published}} in 1988 found that birds and insects <b>overwhelmingly</b> preferred visiting yellow-coloured flowerheads. The species recorded include several species of honeyeater, including the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), western wattlebird (A. lunulata), western spinebill, brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta), New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), white-cheeked honeyeater (P. nigra), singing honeyeater, (Lichenostomus virescens), {{as well as the}} twenty-eight parrot (Barnardius zonarius semitorquatus) two species of native bee of the genus Leioproctus, a beetle of the genus Liparetrus, and ant species Iridomyrmex conifer. The yellow flowerheads are also the ones that bear the most nectar, and are greatly preferred by red wattlebirds.|$|E
5|$|According to a 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), Gaza and the {{adjacent}} al-Shati camp had {{a population of}} 353,115, of which 50.9% were males and 49.1% females. Gaza had an <b>overwhelmingly</b> young population {{with more than half}} being between the ages of infancy to 19 (60.8%). About 28.8% were between the ages of 20 to 44, 7.7% between 45 and 64, and 3.9% were over the age of 64.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2011 census, Bath, {{together}} with North East Somerset, which includes areas around Bath {{as far as}} the Chew Valley, had a population of 176,015.

Other ethnic groups in the district, in order of population size, are multiracial at 1.6%, Asian at 2.6% and black at 0.8% (the national averages are 1.98%, 6.92% and 3.01%, respectively).|$|E
5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} <b>overwhelmingly</b> effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E
5|$|Altitudinal {{migration}} {{is a form}} of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are <b>overwhelmingly</b> neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the {{population}} of Belgium was <b>overwhelmingly</b> Catholic. Jews made up the largest non-Christian population in the country, numbering between 70–75,000 out of a population of 8 million. Most lived in large towns and cities in Belgium, such as Antwerp and Brussels. The vast majority were recent immigrants to Belgium fleeing persecution in Germany and Eastern Europe and, as a result, only a small minority actually possessed Belgian citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Beauregard {{commanded}} armies in the Western Theater, {{including at}} the Battle of Shiloh in Tennessee, and the Siege of Corinth in northern Mississippi. He returned to Charleston and defended it in 1863 from repeated naval and land attacks by Union forces. His greatest achievement was saving the important industrial city of Petersburg, Virginia, in June 1864, {{and thus the}} nearby Confederate capital of Richmond, from assaults by <b>overwhelmingly</b> superior Union Army forces.|$|E
5|$|Because Baltimore's {{electorate}} is <b>overwhelmingly</b> Democratic, whoever won the Democratic {{primary election}} {{was seen as}} the favorite over the Republican nominee in the general election. Baltimore's large African American population initially made it seem likely that the next mayor would also be African American. Kweisi Mfume was the preferred candidate of local politicians, but he opted not to run. Though Carl Stokes and Lawrence Bell, members of the City Council, declared for the race, local leaders were underwhelmed with the quality of declared candidates.|$|E
5|$|By 1920, Roosevelt, on Howe's advice, {{had made}} peace with Tammany boss Charles Murphy, and again sought New York state office. In July, however, he was drafted by the Democratic National Convention as the vice presidential nominee on a ticket with Ohio {{governor}} James M. Cox. Roosevelt selected Howe as his campaign manager. The CoxRoosevelt ticket lost <b>overwhelmingly</b> to Republicans Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge, but both Roosevelt and Howe saw themselves as having successfully built Roosevelt a national reputation; {{not long after the}} election, Howe boasted to several friends that Roosevelt would soon occupy the White House, taking Howe with him.|$|E
5|$|By early July, Butler had {{realized}} {{the futility of}} his race, and took to ignoring Tillman in his speeches, which the governor reciprocated, taking much of the drama from the debates. The two men even rode in the same carriage on July 4. Nevertheless, Butler refused to surrender, even after the primary for the legislature was <b>overwhelmingly</b> won by the Tillmanites, threatening action in the courts and an election contest before the Senate. On December 11, 1894, Benjamin Tillman {{was elected to the}} Senate by the new legislature with 131 votes. Butler received 21 and three votes were scattered.|$|E
