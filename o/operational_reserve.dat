5|$|Army Group Centre renewed their {{offensive}} on Moscow in mid-November. Fegelein and the SS Cavalry Brigade {{were held}} back as an <b>operational</b> <b>reserve</b> in the rearward {{area of the}} 9th Army. Massive counter-attacks by the Red Army led to a weakening of the entire German line, and the brigade {{was called in to}} fight at the front on 28 December. While Fegelein reported that his forces were the equivalent to one or two divisions, in reality he had only 4,428 men in total at this point, of which 1,800 were ready for action. The brigade was deployed at the south-eastern sector of the XXIII Army Corps, where it defended against attacks in the rearward area of the 206th Infantry Division in the Battles of Rzhev. The SS Cavalry Brigade took serious losses, with casualties of up to 60 per cent in some squadrons.|$|E
5|$|Despite Negev's achievements, {{they were}} also given an order to retreat, as the Israeli command {{did not wish to}} fight in broad daylight. The {{retreating}} forces {{had no choice but to}} use a route similar to the ones they came from, which slowed down their movement. Most of the machine guns that they had brought had broken down in the sandy environment, and could not provide them with cover. They were also carrying a multitude of wounded soldiers. Muhammad Naguib decided to use the armored vehicles in his <b>operational</b> <b>reserve</b> against the retreating forces, fearing a possible cut-off from the rest of the Egyptian forces in Palestine. According to Simha Shiloni, commander of the Negev Beasts battalion, the Israelis, especially the wounded, thought that all was lost when this happened. However, the vehicles stopped eventually as they got bogged down in the sands, and the troops made it back to Nitzanim. Sixteen Israeli soldiers were killed in the retreat.|$|E
50|$|The {{role of the}} 6th French Light Armoured Division and the US XVIII Airborne Corps was {{to protect}} the theatre left flank and perhaps draw off Iraqi {{tactical}} and <b>operational</b> <b>reserves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Forces of the People's Liberation Army that {{participated in}} the Battle of Batina were: 51st {{divisions}} with 7th, 8th and 12th Vojvodina Brigade and reinforcements which were made out of <b>operational</b> <b>reserves</b> in Sombor (The 12th and 36th Corps of the People's Liberation Army).|$|R
50|$|The first echelon used raw {{firepower}} {{and mass}} {{to break the}} layered enemy defences, but the second echelon <b>operational</b> <b>reserves</b> combined firepower and mobility, something lacking in the former. Operational units were heavily formed from mechanized, motorised and Cavalry forces. These forces would now seek to envelope the enemy tactical forces as yet unengaged along the flanks of the breakthrough point. Other units would press on to occupy the operational zones and meet the enemy <b>operational</b> <b>reserves</b> as they moved through his rear {{to establish a new}} defence's line. While in the operational rear of the enemy, communications and supply depots were prime targets for the Soviet forces. With his tactical zones isolated from reinforcements, reinforcements blocked from relieving them, the front would be indefensible. Such a method would instigate operational paralysis for the defender.|$|R
5|$|Kluge {{welcomed the}} decision, {{as he was}} already in the process of {{withdrawing}} units of the 9th Army from the northern side of the Kursk salient to deal with Soviet attacks on his flank. But Manstein was greatly disappointed. He argued that his forces were now on the verge of achieving a major breakthrough on the southern side of the salient. As he saw it, with his III Panzer Corps about to link up with the II SS-Panzer Corps at Prokhorovka, and with the XXIV Panzer Corps available as his <b>operational</b> <b>reserve,</b> they would be halting the offensive just at the moment when victory was in hand. With an eye toward the west, Hitler was unwilling to continue the offensive. Manstein persisted, proposing that his forces should at least destroy the Soviet reserves in the southern Kursk salient before Citadel was finally terminated, so that the Soviet fighting capacity in the sector would be depleted {{for the rest of the}} summer. Hitler agreed to continue offensive operations in the southern salient until Manstein's goal was achieved.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{receiving}} the order, Shimon Avidan called an emergency meeting at Hatzor. Yehoshua Goldrat, the only {{officer in the}} brigade who had experience from the British Army operating a combined force of infantry, armor, artillery and air, wrote the operational order. The order was in English, as Goldrat was not fluent in Hebrew, and was handed out to the battalion commanders on June 1. The battalion commanders translated the document into Hebrew for the company commanders. According to the plan, six companies (3 Palmach and 3 Irgun) would attack the Egyptians from the south. Three companies (2 from the 52nd and one from the 51st battalions) would attack from the north, and two companies (one from the 53rd Battalion and one from Irgun) would prevent a retreat to the east. A company from the 53rd Battalion would block reinforcement from Majdal. Only senior officers knew of the full plans however. Simha Shiloni, commander of the Palmach forces (Negev Beasts Battalion), commented that his forces came exhausted and completely unprepared to the assembly points, and he had given consent for their deployment only after being assured that they would serve as the <b>operational</b> <b>reserve</b> (the plan in fact called for these forces to lead the southern assault).|$|E
25|$|Arunta {{was paid}} off into <b>operational</b> <b>reserve</b> {{at the end}} of 1956, where she {{remained}} for twelve years. In 1968, the destroyer was sold for scrap, but was never broken up, instead sinking while under tow off Broken Bay on 13 February 1969.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first phase}} of Soviet deep operations, the [...] "deep battle" [...] envisaged {{breaking}} through the tactical zones and forward German defences. Once these tactical offensives had been successful, fresh <b>operational</b> <b>reserves</b> exploited the breakthrough and the operational depths of the enemy front using powerful mechanized and armoured formations to encircle enemy concentrations on an Army Group Scale.|$|R
25|$|Enver was the {{strategist}} of the operation. Hassan Izzet was the tactician who {{implemented the}} plan and remedied the shortcomings. The failure was blamed on Enver. Beyond his faulty estimate on how the enveloped Russians would react, his failure was on not keeping adequate <b>operational</b> <b>reserves.</b> He {{did not have enough}} field services to alleviate the hardships faced by the soldiers; he analyzed operational necessities theoretically rather than contextually.|$|R
30|$|By {{applying}} {{electrical energy}} storage systems (EESS), PV plant output {{can be reduced}} through EESS charging during the peak production period, thereby keeping the LV feeder voltage stable. The energy stored by EESS can be used later to supply the demand. In addition, EESS can smooth out the PV power fluctuations and provide <b>operational</b> <b>reserves</b> to the system. Commercial solutions as such have been developed in the market [17].|$|R
25|$|German {{intelligence}} {{detected the}} Soviet buildup, allowing {{them time to}} strengthen the forward defenses of the LIII Army Corps {{with large numbers of}} anti-tank weapons, minefields, and hastily dug trenches and dugouts. The German armor was withdrawn rearwards to create an <b>operational</b> <b>reserve,</b> and constructed rear defenses with multiple lines of dugouts and bunkers. The German defenses were based on the Zhizdra and Vytebet Rivers, the network of ravines, and settlements turned into fortified strongpoints.|$|E
25|$|Oded {{attacked}} from Karatiyya {{with the}} strength of four companies, without artillery or armored support. At 21:00 on October 18, they breached the fence of the 2nd position, but met with heavy fire and the deputy battalion commander was killed in action. The company in the <b>operational</b> <b>reserve</b> was brought to assist, but failed to effect a difference. Meanwhile, another company assaulted the 4th position and also managed to breach the fence. Interpreted as a success, the final company was sent to attack the 3rd position. It stalled due to Egyptian artillery fire and withdrew. At 02:00 on October 19, the company attacking the 4th position, pinned down and unable to advance, retreated as well, and at 03:00, the Oded forces fighting at the 2nd position did the same.|$|E
25|$|On {{the next}} night, the 15th was {{pulled out of}} the line and by the morning of 30 August {{concentrated}} in the forests south of Meshalkino. An attack with Group Bogdanov towards Sorokino was planned, but was instead cancelled due to the 12th Tank Corps' heavy losses. During the day, the corps' 195th Tank Brigade helped two battalions of the 61st Army's 156th Rifle Division escape encirclement. Meanwhile, Group Mostovenko managed to cross the Vytebet, and Romanenko shifted the attack yet again to the center and right flank. The 15th Corps and 264th Rifle were transferred there, while the 12th Corps was withdrawn to the <b>operational</b> <b>reserve</b> to repel possible German counterattacks. Only 181 tanks remained in the army by this time, which meant that the losses of the previous nine days amounted to around 60% of the corps' armor, although some of the damaged tanks were later repaired.|$|E

5000|$|Varfolomeev, unlike Triandafilov, {{was less}} {{concerned}} with developing the quantitative indices of deep battle, but rather {{the mechanics of the}} shock army's mission. Varfolomeev termed this as [...] "launching an uninterrupted, deep and shattering blow" [...] along the main axis of advance. Varfolomeev believed the shock army needed both firepower and mobility to destroy both enemy tactical defences, <b>operational</b> <b>reserves</b> and seize geographical targets or positions in harmony with other operationally independent, but strategically collaborative, offensives.|$|R
2500|$|Although the Ottomans had fairly {{accurately}} {{estimated the}} total Allied strength, Liman lacked intelligence on the Allied plans and dispositions {{and was forced}} to dispose his forces evenly along the entire length of his front. Moreover, almost his entire fighting strength was in the front line. The armies' only <b>operational</b> <b>reserves</b> were the two German regiments and the two understrength cavalry divisions. Further back there were no strategic reserves other than some [...] "Depot Regiments", not organised as fighting units, and scattered garrisons and line of communication units.|$|R
500|$|The new IDF plans {{put forth}} for the June 2–3 {{operation}} were slightly {{changed from the}} original. These included 1,150 fighters, as opposed to 1,300 in the initial plan. The forces consisted of the following: two Palmach companies from the Beersheba Battalion and one from the Negev Beasts Battalion, under Yohanan Zariz, a light vehicle company, two companies from the 54th Battalion and one from the 51st, under Zvi Zur, three Irgun companies, a reinforced company and platoon from the 53rd Battalion and eight artillery pieces (six Napoleonchiks and two 4.2" [...] mortars). Another light vehicle company {{would be in the}} <b>operational</b> <b>reserve.</b> Against them were placed Egypt's 2nd Brigade, including the 2nd and 9th Battalions, three medium gun platoons, the brigade headquarters, and 12 pieces of artillery.|$|E
500|$|The 143rd Home Guard Regiment {{advanced}} towards Plaški, capturing it that evening, {{while the}} 14th Home Guard Regiment captured Primišlje, [...] northwest of Slunj. At 0:30a.m., the ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade and {{a company of}} the 19th Infantry Brigade counter-attacked at the Korana bridgehead, causing {{the bulk of the}} 137th Home Guard Regiment to panic and flee across the river. A single platoon of the regiment remained but the ARSK troops did not exploit the opportunity to destroy the bridgehead. In the morning, the regiment reoccupied the bridgehead, reinforced by a 350-strong battlegroup drawn from the 104th Brigade (including a tank platoon and multiple rocket launchers), and a company of the 148th Brigade from the Karlovac Corps <b>operational</b> <b>reserve.</b> The regiment and the battlegroup managed to extend the bridgehead towards the KarlovacSlunj road. The 110th Home Guard Regiment attacked again south of Karlovac, but was repelled by prepared ARSK defences. That night, the Karlovac Corps decided to move elements of the 110th Home Guard Regiment and the 104th Brigade to the Korana bridgehead, while the ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade retreated to the right bank of Korana in an area extending about [...] north from Slunj.|$|E
2500|$|After being {{prepared}} for placement in <b>operational</b> <b>reserve,</b> Arunta paid off to reserve on 21 December 1956.

25|$|The Soviet {{victory in}} the Korsun-Shevchenkovsky Offensive marked the {{successful}} implementation of Soviet deep operations. Soviet Deep Battle doctrine envisaged {{the breaking of the}} enemy's forward defences to allow fresh <b>operational</b> <b>reserves</b> to exploit the breakthrough by driving into the strategic depth of the enemy front. The arrival of large numbers of U.S. and British built trucks and halftracks gave the Soviet forces much greater mobility than they had in the earlier portion of the war. This, coupled with the Soviet capacity to hold large formations in reserve gave the Red Army the ability to drive deep behind German defenses again and again.|$|R

2500|$|On 1 October 1995, John F. Kennedy was {{designated}} {{to be an}} <b>operational</b> <b>reserve</b> carrier and Naval Reserve Force ship with a combined full-time active duty and part-time Naval Reserve crew complement, assigned to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. Kennedy {{would be available to}} deploy with either an active or reserve carrier air wing when mobilized in support of urgent operational requirements. In this capacity, John F. Kennedys new primary function would be to provide a surge capability, and in peacetime, to support training requirements. She would participate in routine fleet exercises, aviator carrier qualifications, and battle group training. The impetus for this initiative was post-Cold War defense spending in the mid-1990s, however, the Naval Reserve was never adequately funded to accomplish major maintenance actions for the Kennedy, further exacerbated by additional defense cutbacks that eliminated Carrier Air Wing Reserve 30 and the downgrading of Carrier Air Wing Reserve 20 to a non-deployable Tactical Support Wing and the return of many of the Reserve's front-line combat aircraft to the active duty force. [...] Following the 11 Sep 2001 attacks on the United States, the <b>Operational</b> <b>Reserve</b> Carrier concept was discontinued and Kennedy was returned to the active duty fleet and placed back in the same maintenance rotation as active duty carriers.|$|E

5000|$|On November 3, Iraqi forces reached Abadan in Iran's Khuzestan province. Iranian {{resistance}} {{proved too}} strong, however, so Iraqi commanders called for reinforcements.

Guderian in turn presented the intelligence results to Adolf Hitler, who refused to believe them, dismissing the apparent Soviet strength as [...] "the greatest imposture since Genghis Khan". Guderian had proposed to evacuate the divisions of Army Group North trapped in the Courland Pocket to the Reich via the Baltic Sea to get the necessary manpower for the defence, but Hitler forbade it. In addition, Hitler commanded that one major <b>operational</b> <b>reserve,</b> the troops of Sepp Dietrich's 6th Panzer Army, be moved to Hungary to support Operation Frühlingserwachen.|$|E

The ridge was [...] wide at its narrowest point, with a steep drop {{on the eastern}} side, all but eliminating the possibility of counterattacks if the ridge was captured. The Germans were apprehensive about the inherent weakness of the Vimy Ridge defences. The German defensive scheme was to maintain a front line defence of sufficient strength to defend against an initial assault and move <b>operational</b> <b>reserves</b> forward, before the enemy could consolidate their gains or overrun remaining German positions. As a result, the German defence at Vimy Ridge relied largely on machine guns, which acted as force multipliers for the defending infantry.|$|R
