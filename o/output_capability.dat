25|$|Commodore {{sold the}} C64 {{not only through}} its network of {{authorized}} dealers, but also through department stores, discount stores, toy stores and college bookstores. The C64 had a built-in RF modulator and thus could be plugged into any television set. This allowed it (like its predecessor, the VIC-20) to compete directly against video game consoles such as the Atari 2600. Like the Apple IIe, the C64 can also output a composite video signal (avoiding the RF modulator) that can be plugged into a specialized monitor for a sharper picture. Unlike the IIe, the C64's NTSC <b>output</b> <b>capability</b> also includes separate luminance/chroma signal output equivalent to (and electrically compatible with) S-Video, for connection to the Commodore 1702 monitor, providing even better video quality than a composite signal. Aggressive pricing of the C64 is considered {{to have been a}} major catalyst in the North American video game crash of 1983. In January 1983, Commodore offered a $100 rebate in the United States on the purchase of a C64 to anyone that traded in another video game console or computer. To take advantage of this rebate, some mail-order dealers and retailers offered a Timex Sinclair 1000 for as little as $10 with purchase of a C64, so the consumer could send the TS1000 to Commodore, collect the rebate, and pocket the difference; Timex Corporation departed the computer market within a year. Commodore's tactics soon led to a price war with the major home computer manufacturers. The success of the VIC-20 and C64 contributed significantly to the exit from the field of Texas Instruments and other smaller competitors.|$|E
500|$|A diesel {{generator}} is housed within the enclosure to supply electricity when external power is unavailable. Of the constant tone <b>output</b> <b>capability,</b> designer Tom Danley {{wrote that the}} [...] "target 94dB at 250 meters is not the essentially fictional 'burst' or 'peak SPL' nonsense in pro sound, or like the 'death burp' signal used in car sound contests." [...] At the annual National Systems Contractors Association (NSCA) convention in March 2007, the Matterhorn was barred from making any loud demonstrations of its power {{because of concerns about}} damaging the building of the Orange County Convention Center. Instead, using only a single 20 amp electrical circuit for safety, visitors were allowed to step inside the horn of the subwoofer for an [...] "acoustic massage" [...] as the fractionally powered Matterhorn reproduced low level 10–15Hz waves.|$|E

We have adopted this technology for the Whack-a-Mole game to show how it can improve the accessibility and usability of mobile games. This paper describes the design of the game and explores how physical interaction with dynamic NFC-displays can compensate the constraints of mobile games and enrich their gameplay...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a modular system of interactive tiles to support therapists’ in performing therapeutic activities together with impaired children in a swimming pool. Active Surfaces support mobile interactions and dynamic configuration of assemblies of tiles. Each tile represents an interactive unit, able to communicate with other tiles and to exchange data. The tiles can be assembled on a physical and logical service level to support activities of different complexity. This creates technical challenges where assemblies are re-created over time between devices with limited input and <b>output</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Furthermore, Active Surfaces challenge the concept of understandability and how users can make sense of assembled systems with no or limited <b>output</b> <b>capabilities...</b>|$|R

50|$|Continuous power {{measurements}} do {{not actually}} describe the highly varied signals found in audio equipment (which could vary from high crest factor instrument recordings down to 0 dB crest factor square waves) but are {{widely regarded as}} a reasonable way of describing an amplifier's maximum <b>output</b> <b>capability.</b> For audio equipment, this is nearly always the nominal frequency range of human hearing, 20 Hz to 20 kHz.|$|E
40|$|Mobile {{devices such}} as PDAs and cellphones suffer from limited input and <b>output</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Unlike the {{processing}} and storage capabilities of these devices, which will improve over time, their input and <b>output</b> <b>capabilities</b> will always remain limited because they must remain small and light enough that users are willing to carry them around. While previous research has concentrated on making more effective use of the existing I/O capabilities of these devices, we propose that we can increase these capabilities by allowing users to opportunistically annex input and output devices they encounter in the local environment. For example, a user might annex a nearby keyboard to type a note into his PDA, or he might read his email on a convenient desktop display. In this paper we discuss potential applications for opportunistic annexing, challenges in designing the user experience, potential software architectures, and security issues...|$|R
