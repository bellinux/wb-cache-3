25|$|In removal {{proceedings}} {{in front}} of an immigration judge, cancellation of removal is a form of relief that is available for certain long-time residents of the United States. It allows a person being faced with the threat of removal to obtain permanent residence if that person has been physically present in the U.S. for at least ten years, has had good moral character during that period, has not been convicted of certain crimes, and can show that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his or her U.S. citizen or permanent resident spouse, children, <b>or</b> <b>parent.</b> This form of relief is only available when a person is served with a Notice to Appear to appear in the proceedings in the court.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the basic}} {{properties}} of life is reproduction, the capacity to generate new individuals, and sex is an aspect of this process. Life has evolved from simple stages to more complex ones, and so have the reproduction mechanisms. Initially the reproduction was a replicating process that consists in producing new individuals that contain the same genetic information as the original <b>or</b> <b>parent</b> individual. This mode of reproduction is called asexual, {{and it is still}} used by many species, particularly unicellular, but it is also very common in multicellular organisms. In sexual reproduction, the genetic material of the offspring comes from two different individuals. As sexual reproduction developed by way of a long process of evolution, intermediates exist. Bacteria, for instance, reproduce asexually, but undergo a process by which a part of the genetic material of an individual (donor) is transferred to an other (recipient).|$|E

500|$|Lady Hale {{was also}} {{concerned}} about the ramifications of the decision. [...] She asked if a doctor treating a patient after an accident and giving evidence about what happened as well as his opinions as to what would happen would be covered or not, or whether only in part. She noted that the ruling in the case would have to apply to experts dealing with cases before tribunals as well as courts, thus including claims for unfair dismissal before employment tribunals and disputes between landlord and tenants about service charges and rent assessments. [...] She queried whether it ought to extend to psychiatrists assessing patients for tribunal proceedings under the Mental Health Act 1983, or educational psychologists giving evidence about children with special educational needs in tribunal proceedings about their future education. In her view, these are [...] "sensitive and often highly fraught cases in which performing the expert's duty to the tribunal may well be perceived by the client patient <b>or</b> <b>parent</b> as a breach of her duty towards him." [...] In family law cases, she said, there would now be some professional witnesses who had immunity from negligence claims for their evidence and others who did not, with some of the distinctions between the two groups appearing to be [...] "arbitrary". She thought that the decision might make experts more likely to confirm their previous views rather than change them, and could lead to higher insurance premiums for experts, increased fees and the use of exemption clauses in contracts – [...] "in which case we shall be back where we started", she said. Overall, she called the decision to change the law [...] "irresponsible" [...] and, like Lord Hope, considered that the topic was best left to Parliament and the Law Commission.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{children}} were {{admitted to the}} Foundling Hospital on 25 March 1741, into a temporary house located in Hatton Garden. At first, no questions were asked about child <b>or</b> <b>parent,</b> but a distinguishing token was put on each child by the parent. These were often marked coins, trinkets, pieces of cotton or ribbon, verses written on scraps of paper. Clothes, if any, were carefully recorded. One entry in the record reads, [...] "Paper on the breast, clout on the head." [...] The applications became too numerous, and a system of balloting with red, white and black balls was adopted.

[...] The purported correction is described as [...] "...to force the children into loving (attaching to) their parents; ... there is a hands-on treatment involving physical restraint and discomfort. Attachment Therapy is the imposition of boundary violations – most often coercive restraint – and verbal abuse on a child, usually for hours at a time; ...

2500|$|Once {{the embryo}} germinates from its seed <b>or</b> <b>parent</b> plant, {{it begins to}} produce {{additional}} organs (leaves, stems, and roots) {{through the process of}} organogenesis. [...] New roots grow from root meristems located {{at the tip of the}} root, and new stems and leaves grow from shoot meristems located at the tip of the shoot. [...] Branching occurs when small clumps of cells left behind by the meristem, and which have not yet undergone cellular differentiation to form a specialized tissue, begin to grow as the tip of a new root or shoot. [...] Growth from any such meristem at the tip of a root or shoot is termed primary growth and results in the lengthening of that root or shoot. Secondary growth results in widening of a root or shoot from divisions of cells in a cambium.|$|E
