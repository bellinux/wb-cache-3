40|$|Plants {{have the}} {{potential}} to accumulate toxic amounts <b>of</b> cadmium (<b>Cd),</b> and understanding how and where Cd is stored in plants is important for ensuring food safety. Previous experiments have determined that a greater amount <b>of</b> <b>Cd</b> is translocated into the leaves of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) as compared to barley leaves (Hordeum vulgare). Preferential retention <b>of</b> <b>Cd</b> in root <b>of</b> barley would explain this difference. Hence, {{the purpose of this study}} was to determine the localization and coordination environment <b>of</b> <b>Cd</b> (i. e., the ligands to which Cd was bound) in the different root tissues of lettuce and barley using histochemical staining, electron microscopy and micro X-ray spectroscopy. Retention <b>of</b> <b>Cd</b> in barley roots could be explained by accumulation <b>of</b> <b>Cd</b> at the endodermis, comparatively higher amounts <b>of</b> <b>Cd</b> sequestered in the symplast of cortical cells and binding to xylem cell walls. Increased translocation <b>of</b> <b>Cd</b> to lettuce shoots seemed to be due to a less effective barrier at the endodermis and less sequestration <b>of</b> <b>Cd</b> in the cortex. Regardless of the tissue type, most <b>of</b> the <b>Cd</b> 2 + was bound to S ligands in the roots of barley, possibly reflecting accumulation of Cd–phytochelatin and Cd–S molecules in the vacuoles. In lettuce roots, Cd was more evenly distributed among ligands containing S, O and NO 3 groups, which is indicative <b>of</b> proportionately more <b>Cd</b> binding to the cell walls, relative to barley. These results will be useful in uncovering the mechanisms of differential Cd-tolerance and sequestration in lettuce and barley...|$|R
