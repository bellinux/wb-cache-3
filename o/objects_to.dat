5|$|Samus Aran is {{typically}} seen wearing the Power Suit, a powered exoskeleton which protects her from most dangers she encounters {{and can be}} enhanced by power-ups collected during gameplay. In regard to offense, the Power Suit boasts the Arm Cannon, which can fire various energy beams, charge beams to shoot an extra-powerful blast, or launch {{a limited number of}} missiles. The Power Suit can also be reconfigured into a small, spherical form called the Morph Ball, which allows her to roll through tight areas, such as tunnels, and use Bombs. The Power Suit is also equipped with a Grapple Beam, which can be used to tether onto <b>objects</b> <b>to</b> cross large distances, such as chasms. Additionally, its visor can be used to scan <b>objects</b> <b>to</b> learn more about them, a feature that has been used since Metroid Prime. Aside from her Power Suit, Samus is also in possession of a Gunship, which is used in the games to save progress and restore her health and ammunition.|$|E

5|$|A {{group is}} a {{mathematical}} structure consisting {{of a set of}} objects together with a binary operation, that is, an operation combining any two <b>objects</b> <b>to</b> a third, subject to certain requirements. A group in which the objects are matrices and the group operation is matrix multiplication is called a matrix group. Since in a group every element has to be invertible, the most general matrix groups are the groups of all invertible matrices of a given size, called the general linear groups.|$|E

5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain {{walls and the}} tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks {{on top of a}} wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers {{at the base of the}} wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed <b>objects</b> <b>to</b> be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees {{have been}} {{observed}} to partake in social learning. In a 2017 study involving Bombus terrestris, bees were taught to complete an unnatural task of moving large <b>objects</b> <b>to</b> obtain a reward.

The bees did not copy each other exactly: in fact, the study suggested that the bees were instead attempting to emulate each other's goals.|$|E
5|$|Charles Messier {{measured}} {{the position of}} the cluster and included it as M45 in his catalogue of comet-like objects, published in 1771. Along with the Orion Nebula and the Praesepe cluster, Messier's inclusion of the Pleiades has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets—something that seems scarcely possible for the Pleiades. One possibility is that Messier simply wanted to have a larger catalogue than his scientific rival Lacaille, whose 1755 catalogue contained 42 objects, and so he added some bright, well-known <b>objects</b> <b>to</b> boost his list.|$|E

The concept of force is used to describe an influence which causes a free body (<b>object)</b> <b>to</b> accelerate. It can be a push or a pull, which causes an <b>object</b> <b>to</b> change direction, have new velocity, or to deform temporarily or permanently. Generally speaking, force causes an object's state of motion to change.|$|R
5|$|Common ravens {{are known}} to steal and cache shiny objects such as pebbles, pieces of metal, and golf balls. One theory is that they hoard shiny <b>objects</b> <b>to</b> impress other ravens. Other {{research}} indicates that juveniles are deeply curious about all new things, and that common ravens retain an attraction to bright, round objects based on their similarity to bird eggs. Mature birds lose their intense interest in the unusual, and become highly neophobic.|$|E
5|$|Data {{from the}} ZDR was {{passed to the}} All-Target Processor (ATP), which ran initial {{processing}} on as many as 625 objects in a cloud. As many as 50 of these could be picked out for further processing in the Discrimination and Control Computer (DCC), which ran more tests on those tracks and assigned each one a probability of being the warhead or decoy. The DCC was able to run 100 different tests. For exoatmospheric signals the tests included measure of radar return pulse-to-pulse to look for tumbling objects, as well as variations in signals strength due to changes in frequency. Within the atmosphere, the primary method was examining the velocities of the <b>objects</b> <b>to</b> determine their mass.|$|E
