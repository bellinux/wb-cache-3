Some believed Haas copied or reverse engineered this machine {{but at the time}} existing machines were so hard to use that Haas used them as an example of what not to do. Over time, Haas machine tools became extremely popular, mostly because they are simple, very affordable, and because the in-house designed computer control is <b>operator-friendly</b> (no soft-keys or cryptic menus).|$|E

Within all these various types of incentives, mechanisms have been proposed and altered or occasionally cancelled due to both a change in the economic situation and the need to find procedures that can be more <b>operator-friendly</b> and less expensive for public authorities to review the incentive requests.|$|E

40|$|With the {{improvement}} of nuclear technology and nuclear safety, accidental operating procedure, as {{an important component of}} the defence in depth concept for nuclear power plant operation, develops in the way of being more robust and more <b>operator-friendly,</b> especially following the Three Miles Island accident. In China, nuclear power plants try to change from Event Oriented Procedure (EOP) to State Oriented Procedure (SOP) which is a scenario independent approach, developed by French institutes. This paper tries to discuss the principle of the state oriented approach and the composition of SOP. At the same time, comparison between SOP and EOP is made.

30|$|Since Marx’s {{publications}} [1, 2], {{platelet-rich plasma}} (PRP) {{has been widely}} applied in regenerative therapy. However, because the preparation protocol is relatively complex and not standardized between laboratories, its clinical outcomes have often varied significantly among individual clinical research groups [3]. To overcome this disadvantage, Choukroun and his co-workers developed platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) by modifying the process of PRP preparation [3 – 5]. PRF can be prepared solely through the activation of an endogenous coagulation process {{without the aid of}} animal-derived coagulants such as bovine thrombin. Its advantages include <b>operator-friendly</b> preparation procedures and doctor-friendly handling when used in a clinical setting. However, the primary and more important advantage of PRF should be attributed to its clinical effectiveness rather than efficiency in preparation and handling.|$|E
40|$|Performance, {{reliability}} and security are important concerns in modern data networks and mission critical systems increasingly depend on them. This thesis investigates these concerns on software-defined networks (SDNs) that are built using Ethernet networking technology. We propose and evaluate some {{solutions to the}} problems identified in this process, keeping in mind that our solutions should be simple retrofits as far as possible to minimize change or frustration for the data network user. We then present field findings from a practical deployment of our SDN controller, Ironstack, on an enterprise network setting. Finally, based on this operational experience, we develop a drop-in network switch augmentation that combines our aforementioned solutions and controller into an <b>operator-friendly</b> box, providing a turnkey solution for deploying all the systems described in this thesis...|$|E
40|$|DESY {{has nine}} accelerators in operation. The {{reliable}} and <b>operator-friendly</b> control of these accelerators {{is necessary for}} the successful operation of HERA, DORIS and PETRA in order to provide a good experimental environment for the four experiments at HERA and the numerous users of synchrotron light at DORIS and PETRA. As already reported in PCaPAC’ 96 PETRA was upgraded to a PC-based control system in spring 1996. Proven concepts and improved programs have been used to renew the control system of storage ring DORIS in the shutdown of 1997. A step by step migration of controls from the old system to the PC-based one is under way and is carried out during normal machine operation of the lepton and proton preaccelerators. In the following an overview of the underlying concepts of the homogeneous control system will be given. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{nature of}} {{production}} in the manufacturing industry is changing, and companies face large challenges. Customers expect fast delivery times, proven sustainability, flexibility, and frequent product upgrades. To stay competitive and manage rapid technological demands, a parallel, iterative and interactive development approach for product and process design is required. Closed-loop systems will increase future customer demand for easy upgrading. This requires highly modular and <b>operator-friendly</b> product designs. Because the complexity, variety and unpredictability of products and production tasks will increase, information and support systems for operators are crucial elements.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{represents}} the initial {{phase of a}} proposed <b>operator-friendly</b> semiautomatic method for positioning and directing an intravascular three-magnet tip catheter in the human heart using an electromagnetic system. Methods: A predictive computer algorithm based on a comprehensive mathematical model is developed, which accurately calculates the magnetic field generated by the electromagnet system {{as well as the}} magnetic torques and forces exerted on a three-magnet tip catheter, and generates the necessary electromagnet currents for arbitrary displacement and deflection of the catheter tip within a workspace of 128 × 128 × 128 mm. Results: We demonstrate the ability of the developed mathematical model to accurately position a three-magnet tip catheter within the 128 × 128 × 128 mm workspace of a 3 D eight-electromagnet system.

40|$|Highly {{developed}} and sophisticated production techniques of modern solar cells with functional optical elements show {{the need for}} a quick, precise, cost effective and <b>operator-friendly</b> characterisation technique. Variable Angle Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (VASE) can fulfil this task. Even though well established for a range of known materials, the application to new materials isn’t always straightforward. Since VASE is based on an iterative modelling process by optimisation of some figures of merit, {{there is a lot of}} experimental work to do to prove assumptions about the sample which must be made beforehand. In this work, we correlate PECVD deposition parameters with VASE model parameters and certain features of hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbide (a-SixC 1 -x:H). a-SixC 1 -x:H is a very versatile material that can be adapted to a very wide range of concepts to enhance the efficiency of silicon solar cells. To prove this, we show the production of a Bragg filter consisting of ten alternating layers of this material...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a unified framework for achieving robust and real-time image stabilization and rectification. While compensating {{for a small}} amount of image jitter due to platform vibration and hand tremble is not a very difficult task, canceling a large amount of image jitter, due to significant, long-range, and purposeful camera motion (such as panning, zooming, and rotation), is much more challenging. Our framework selectively compensates for unwanted camera motion to maintain a stable view of the scene. The rectified display has the same information content, but is shown in a much more <b>operator-friendly</b> way. Our contribution is threefold: (1) proposing a unified image rectification algorithm to cancel large and purposeful image motion to achieve a stable display that is applicable for both farfield and near-field image conditions, (2) improving the robustness and real-time performance of these algorithms with extensive validation on real images, and (3) illustrating the potential of these algorithms by applying them to real-world problems in diverse application domains. 1...|$|E
40|$|Surprisingly, console logs rarely help {{operators}} detect {{problems in}} large-scale datacenter services, for they often consist of the voluminous intermixing of messages from many software components written by independent developers. We propose a general methodology to mine this {{rich source of}} information to automatically detect system runtime problems. We first parse console logs by combining source code analysis with information retrieval to create composite features. We then analyze these features using machine learning to detect operational problems. We show that our method enables analyses that are impossible with previous methods because of its superior ability to create sophisticated features. We also show how to distill {{the results of our}} analysis to an <b>operator-friendly</b> one-page decision tree showing the critical messages associated with the detected problems. We validate our approach using the Darkstar online game server and the Hadoop File System, where we detect numerous real problems with high accuracy and few false positives. In the Hadoop case, we are able to analyze 24 million lines of console logs in 3 minutes. Our methodology works on textual console logs of any size and requires no changes to the service software, no human input, and no knowledge of the software’s internals. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: : No perfect {{solution}} yet exists for dermal fillers. The authors hypothesized that autologous dermis can be processed in an <b>operator-friendly</b> manner and adopted in selected patients as a filler, following {{the principle of}} replacing "like with like. " METHODS: : The authors designed a prototype "cutting chamber" to morsel dermis into an injectable form. Autologous injectable dermis grafting was performed in 16 patients who underwent lip or labionasal fold correction concomitant with abdominoplasty or cesarean scar correction; patient dermis {{was used for the}} donor graft. Furthermore, injectable dermis grafting was performed in the subcutaneous tissue of three patients undergoing multistage reconstructive procedures for obesity. The grafts were harvested and examined histologically at 3, 7, and 12 months. RESULTS: : Dermis processing and injection proved feasible with limited effort. All 16 patients presented good volume maintenance by 12 months. Two reported transient palpable firmness for the first 6 months, which subsequently resolved. Histological examination of processed and injected dermis showed volume maintenance over time, effective revascularization of the mass, and structural reorganization with collagen bundles and nested fibroblasts reminiscent of reticular dermis. A transient inflammatory reaction was observed, consistent with the expected healing events. CONCLUSIONS: : Use of autologous dermis as a filler substance for both aesthetic and reconstructive procedures appears to be a feasible option. It could be advised for patients requiring filler correction who undergo concomitant procedures involving excision of potential donor dermis...|$|E

Packet based data networks such as BT's Switched Multi- megabit Data Service (SMDS) have performance that varies with customer behaviour, network design and network pro- vision. This paper describes a system researched to monitor such networks from the customer's perspective, but on be- half of the operator. The information generated allows the operator to determine whether the network is performing correctly or whether changes or customer load will require the network to be changed in some way. Such networks are increasing important as many parts of the Internet are built on similar technologies. The paper speci cally considers an architecture which encompasses all the main functionality involved in perfor- mance management of networks. Consideration is given to the management and dissemination of the data collected. A database to enhance network data mining performance is described. A method to identify the periods of signi - cance in the measurement data based on a statistical test and a neural network is incorporated into a realisation of the architecture. In addition, a novel mechanism for the real-time presentation of the network performance data in an <b>operator-friendly</b> manner is given...|$|E
40|$|This {{technical}} report {{is based on}} five our recent articles: ”Self-organizing map based visualization techniques and their assessment”, ”Combining neural methods and knowledge-based methods in accident management”, ”Abnormal process state detection by cluster center point monitoring in BWR nuclear power plant”, “Generated control limits as a basis of <b>operator-friendly</b> process monitoring”, and “Modelling power output at nuclear power plant by neural networks”. Neural methods are applied in process monitoring, visualization and early fault detection. We introduce decision support schemes based on Self-Organizing Map (SOM) combined with other methods. Visualizations based on various data-analysis methods are developed in large Finnish research project many Universities and industrial partners participating. In our subproject the industrial partner providing data into our practical examples is Teollisuuden Voima Oy, Olkiluoto Nuclear power plant. Measurement of the information value is one challenging issue. On long run our research has moved from Accident Management to more Failure Management. One interesting case example introduced is detecting pressure drift of the boiling water reactor by multivariate methods including innovative visualizations. We also present two different neural network approaches for industrial process signal forecasting. Preprosessing suitable input signals and delay analysis are important phases in modelling. Optimized number of delayed input signals and neurons in hidden-layer are found to make a possible prediction of an idle power process signal. Algorithms on input selection and finding the optimal model for one-step-ahead prediction are developed. We introduce a method to detect abnormal process state based on cluster center point monitoring in time. Typical statistical features are extracted, mapped to n-dimensional space, and clustered online for every step. The process signals in the constant time window are classified into two clusters by the K-means method. In addition to monitoring features of the process signals, signal trends and alarm lists, a tool is got that helps in early detection of the pre-stage of a process fault. We also introduce data generated control limits, where alarm balance feature clarifies the monitoring. This helps in early and accurate fault detection...|$|E
40|$|The Trigger and DAQ (TDAQ) {{system of}} the ATLAS {{experiment}} {{is a very complex}} distributed computing system, composed of O(10000) of applications running on more than 2000 computers. The TDAQ Controls system has to guarantee the smooth and synchronous operations of all TDAQ components and has to provide the means to minimize the downtime of the system caused by runtime failures, which are inevitable for a system of such scale and complexity. During data taking runs, streams of information messages sent or published by TDAQ applications are the main sources of knowledge about correctness of running operations. The huge flow of operational monitoring data produced (with an average rate of O(1 - 10 KHz)) is constantly monitored by experts to detect problem or misbehavior. Given the scale of the system and the rates of data to be analyzed, the automation of the Control system functionality in areas of operational monitoring, system verification, error detection and recovery is a strong requirement. It allows to reduce the operations man power needs and to assure a constant high quality of problem detection and following recovery. To accomplish its objective, the Controls system includes some high-level components which are based on advanced software technologies, namely the rule-based expert system (ES) and the complex event processing (CEP) engines. The chosen techniques allow to formalize, to store and to reuse the TDAQ experts' knowledge in the Control framework and thus to assist TDAQ shift crew to accomplish its task. DVS (Diagnostics and Verification System) and Online Recovery components are responsible for the automation of system testing and verification, diagnostics of failures and recovery procedures. These components are built on top of a common technology of a forward-chaining ES framework (based on CLIPS expert system shell), that allows to program the behavior of a system in terms of “if-then” rules and to easily extend or modify the knowledge base. The core of AAL (Automated monitoring and AnaLysis) component is a CEP (Complex Event Processing) engine implemented using ESPER in Java. The engine is loaded with a set of directives and it performs correlation and analysis of operational messages and events and produces <b>operator-friendly</b> alerts, assisting TDAQ operators to react promptly in case of problems or to perform important routine tasks. The component is known to shifters as "Shifter Assistant" (SA), and introduction of the SA allowed {{to reduce the number of}} shifters in the ATLAS control room. Design foresees a machine learning module to detect anomaly and problems that cannot be defined in advance. The described components are constantly used for the ATLAS Trigger-DAQ system operations, and the knowledge base is growing as more expertise is acquired. By the end of 2011 the size of the knowledge base used for TDAQ operations was about 300 rules. The paper presents the design and present implementation of the components and also the experience of its use in a real operational environment of the ATLAS experiment...|$|E
