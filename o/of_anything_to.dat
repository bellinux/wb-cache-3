25|$|In the {{intervening}} period, AMC replaced Kaplan's race program contact with two new men (Chris Schoenlip and John Voelbel from Lever Brothers (soap marketing people)), {{who had no}} experience in the automotive field and were ignorant <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with racing. They would ultimately prove to be more trouble than they were worth. In fact, it was these two new boys who failed to enter the parts into the official AMC parts system and to submit homologation papers. The importance of this mistake became clear when Kaplan sent the first car to run at the first race of the 1969 season at Jackson, Michigan. Kaplan sent {{one of the older}} 1968 cars with a new engine, but, because they were late and had not qualified, the team had to do some consensus building among the other racers to permit them to enter at all. When the SCCA agreed to let them run, they started last, but, within 10 laps, they were chasing Donohue down and the time differential was narrowing rapidly. After the race, the SCCA asked to see the engine, but he had sent the cars home already. At Lime Rock, the SCCA wanted to tear down the engines before they could start the race. Kaplan bought some time by countering with the challenge {{that they would have to}} tear down the Camaros and Mustangs too. That wasn’t going to happen, so they were allowed to run. It was clear, however, that the problems with the SCCA weren’t going away, at least until the parts could be homologated.|$|E
25|$|The modern Aes Sedai {{operate as}} self-appointed {{guardians of the}} One Power and are often viewed as above local and {{national}} politics. They view themselves as the rightful owners of all angreal and arbiters <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the One Power. They operate as advisers to kings and queens and are shown deference by most. Some nations, however, have banned channeling and view Aes Sedai as suspect, if not outright evil. Aes Sedai search the world for females with the inherent ability to channel, {{or the ability to}} be taught to channel, and bring any they find to the Tower. Untrained channelers can be a danger to themselves and others, often resulting in accidental deaths. Channelers of a certain age that have survived without Tower training are often derisively referred to as wilders by Aes Sedai. Wilders often experience blocks: an inability to access the One Power except through specific rituals or in specific situations. In many instances these wilders have no idea they are channeling or accessing the One Power at all. With training and time, blocks can often be overcome and the wilder can channel at will. Foreign lands outside the Aes Sedai's purview often handle channeling and channelers quite differently from Aes Sedai custom and tend to distrust their assumed authority. Aes Sedai consider them wilders as well, and not entirely without reason. Most foreign channeling traditions have more specific and more limited understanding of the One Power than do Aes Sedai. Additionally, most of these traditions trace their origins back to offshoots of the original Aes Sedai split off after the Breaking of the World. The Aes Sedai, however, can trace their history well back within the Age of Legends.|$|E
500|$|His {{attempt at}} children's comedies met {{additional}} criticism. Surf Ninjas (1993) and Mr. Magoo (1997) had scathing reviews. Several critics were disappointed that Nielsen's role in Surf Ninjas was only [...] "an extended cameo" [...] and Chris Hicks recommended that viewers [...] "avoid any comedy that features Leslie Nielsen {{outside of the}} Naked Gun series." [...] Jeff Miller of the Houston Chronicle panned Mr. Magoo, a live action remake of the 1950s cartoon, by saying, [...] "I'm supposed to suggest how the film might be better but I can't think <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say other than to make the film again." ...|$|E

500|$|After the war the Australian Signal Officer-in-Chief, Major General Colin Simpson, {{paid tribute}} to the {{spotters}}, writing that they were [...] "infantrymen without a typical battlefield, artillerymen without field pieces and tank crews without tanks. Apart from a hard core of very talented personnel, all that most spotters had in common was an abysmal ignorance <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with signals. Yet they won the respect of our Allies and every branch of the Australian forces". He continued, stating that [...] "they were dedicated to their duty and they never failed. The New Guinea Air Warning Wireless Company is a Signal unit of which very little has been heard as their duties were top secret at all times. It can be stated that the successful {{course of the war}} could have been seriously delayed, if not greatly prolonged, if this signal unit had not operated so efficiently." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unlike many ancient Greeks, {{who thought}} that an {{infinite}} regress of causality is possible (and thus held {{that the universe is}} uncaused), Aquinas argues that an infinite chain never accomplishes its objective and is thus impossible.

Further, the First Cause must continuously be in action (similar to how there must always be a first chain in a chain link), otherwise the series collapses: ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the {{evolution}} of punk in the 1970s, there was little rock and roll tradition from Minneapolis, which author Steven Blush attributed to a lack <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> [...] "rebel against", noting that it was Minneapolis' friendly atmosphere that made future hardcore punk musicians [...] "crazy and rebellious". [...] "Every A person in New York was present at CBs while The Replacements joyously flushed the set down the toilet, doing nothing but fractions of other people's songs," [...] said Peter Jesperson who recorded them for Twin/Tone.|$|E
2500|$|One anecdote {{that should}} be {{interesting}} to longtime fans {{is the story of}} Van Halen’s [...] custom Marshall amp, rumored to have been rebuilt from scratch. As he explains it, after the band suffered through a disastrous radio interview where Eddie couldn’t think <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say, David Lee Roth advised him, “Here’s what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna lie. You’re gonna make up some s— so they don’t remember it.” So when he was asked about the amp during a later Guitar Player interview, he followed Roth’s advice.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the full}} extent of the deal has never been fully clarified, it has been {{described}} as [...] "the biggest [...] sale ever <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> anyone", [...] "staggering both by its sheer size and complexity". At a minimum, it is believed to involve the supply and support of 96 Panavia Tornado ground attack aircraft, 24 Air Defence Variants (ADVs), 50 BAE Hawk and 50 Pilatus PC-9 aircraft, specialised naval vessels, and various infrastructure works. The initial Memorandum of Understanding committed the UK to purchasing the obsolete Lightning and Strikemaster aircraft, along with associated equipment and spare parts.|$|E

2500|$|General {{reaction}} to the verdict was one of shock and amazement. [...] In response to public {{reaction to}} the quick verdict, the jury issued a statement saying, [...] "We were present during the entire time of the trial, we heard everything that was said and saw everything that {{was done in the}} courtroom and heard nothing of what was being done and said outside, hence when we had agreed upon a verdict we did not know <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> keep us in the jury room longer." [...] A misunderstanding of the jury instructions may have also {{played a role in the}} verdict. [...] The jury's understanding of the instructions was that they were required to find all of defendants guilty in order to convict and as they could not agree that all eight were involved they felt required to return a not guilty verdict.|$|E
2500|$|... "Fashion" [...] {{started as}} a song called [...] "Jamaica" [...] but Bowie was unable to think <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> write, so he almost {{discarded}} the song {{until late in the}} recording cycle, when it was transformed into the song as it appeared on the album. The track [...] "I Feel Free" [...] (by Cream) was recorded [...] "in rough mix" [...] for the album, but did not appear on a Bowie album until a re-recording for 1993's Black Tie White Noise. A few of the other tracks on the album started with different names: [...] "Ashes to Ashes" [...] began as [...] "People Are Turning to Gold" [...] and [...] "Teenage Wildlife" [...] was originally called [...] "It Happens Everyday". The track [...] "Scream Like a Baby" [...] was originally called [...] "Laser" [...] (the lyric [...] "Scream like a baby" [...] was sung as [...] "I am a laser"). [...] "Laser" [...] was originally written in 1973, and recorded by Ava Cherry and the Astronettes (made up of Bowie collaborators Ava Cherry and Geoff MacCormack), and a demo by Bowie was made during the sessions for [...] "Young Americans" [...] in 1975. The song [...] "Is There Life After Marriage?" [...] was fully written and recorded for the album, but for unknown reasons was never released.|$|E
