During a dive, these animals will reduce their heart rate from 100 beats a minute to between 12 and 20. Blood flow is diverted away from certain tissues and organs and towards the brain, heart and lungs, which require a constant oxygen supply. The amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood is 5.5%, which is greater than that found in land-based mammals and {{is similar to that}} of Weddell seals (a diving marine mammal). One study found a female beluga had 16.5 l of oxygen dissolved in her blood. Lastly, the beluga's muscles contain high levels of the protein myoglobin, which stores oxygen in muscle. Myoglobin concentrations are several times greater than for terrestrial mammals, which help prevent <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficiency</b> during dives.|$|E

Electrical resistance might be locally decreased by local heating with a CW fiber laser. In our experiment, the films were irradiated with the laser in vacuum. Control of temperature on the film was very important for reducing the electrical resistance. Therefore, temperature monitoring of the laser focusing spot area on the film was performed. Temperature of the laser focusing spot area was increased as the laser intensity was increased. Then, the electrical resistance of the laser focus-ing spot area was decreased as the laser intensity was increased. Thus, electrical resistance of the la-ser focusing spot area was decreased as temperature of the laser focusing spot area was increased. These results indicated that electrical resistance of the laser focusing spot area was controlled by changing temperature on the laser focusing spot area...|$|R

In former years <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficiencies</b> were mainly caused by the degree of nitrification taking place. Recent time series from monitoring stations and seasonal longitudinal profiles together with a calibrated water quality model (calibrated with time series of chlorophyll-a and nutrient measurements at station weir Geesthacht) shows that nowadays primary production in the middle stretches of the Elbe river mainly controls the oxygen budget. Improved water quality results in algae blooms with concentrations of chlorphyll-a up to 200 #mu#g/l, pH values up to 9 and oxygen oversaturation of 180 %. As the water depth increases at Hamburg Harbour, radiation conditions deteriorate dramatically, biogenic oxygen production decreases accordingly and oxygen consumption by decomposition of algae biomass prevails oxygen production.

40|$|Various materials, such as {{gold and}} {{tantalum}} oxide, have been researched {{for their use}} as radiation enhancers or “radiosensitisers” with high Z elements showing a high proficiency. Bismuth oxide nanoceramics have been utilised in many applications but their effectiveness as a high Z radiosensitiser {{has not yet been}} examined. The aim of this investigation was to assess the effectiveness of Bi 2 O 3 nanoceramics as radiation enhancers and to tailor the biochemical activity through <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> These were tested on 9 L Gliosarcoma and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell lines. The nanoceramics were characterised using X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy to confirm 50 - 80 nm nanoplatelet morphology and monoclinic crystal structure. The surfaces of the nanoceramics were then examined for atomic composition which showed oxygen reduction of 1. 25 weight% in the argon annealed nanoceramic. Different biological behaviours were observed between the two samples. The air annealed samples showing cytotoxicity, while the argon annealed samples demonstrated cell proliferation and biocompatibility for MDCK and 9 L respectively. Bioactivity was linked to the generation and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS), with the effects dictated by available <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and exposure time. The nanoceramics were then examined under 125 kV and 10 MV radiation energies. Under the 125 kVp energy, both the air and argon nanoceramics had the same calculated sensitisation enhancement ratio (SER). The more effective argon sample was examined under a 10 MV field and demonstrated an SER of 1. 25. The platelet structure of the nanoceramics results in a kV SER higher than other compounds published, but it hinders the 10 MV effectiveness due to the aggregate size trapping the produced electrons in the material.
