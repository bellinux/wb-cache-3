5|$|In a 1989 review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> {{juvenile}} delinquency and violence, Lisabeth DiLalla and Gottesman found delinquency could be transitory or continuous, and genes contributed {{more to the}} continuous type. In 1991 the same authors published {{a critique of the}} then-prevalent idea of antisocial behavior being transmitted through generations by child abuse alone in antisocial families. They stated that a review by Cathy Spatz Widom and the studies she cited had missed an element: children maltreated in families might have been targets because their genes might have influenced them into committing antisocial acts and attracting such treatment from parents.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} the Hungarian {{language}} {{is one of the}} main sources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> the ethnogenesis of the Hungarian people because a language shows the circumstances of its own development and its contacts with other idioms. According to a scholarly theory, the oldest layers of Hungarian vocabulary show features of the territory in which the language emerged. The study of loan words from other languages is instrumental in determining direct contacts between the ancient speakers of the Hungarian language and other peoples. Loan words also reflect changes in the way of life of the Magyars.|$|E
5|$|Though {{naturally}} occurring platinum alloys containing all six platinum-group metals {{were used for}} a long time by pre-Columbian Americans and known as a material to European chemists from the mid-16th century, not until the mid-18th century was platinum identified as a pure element. That natural platinum contained palladium, rhodium, osmium and iridium was discovered {{in the first decade of}} the 19th century. Platinum in alluvial sands of Russian rivers gave access to raw material for use in plates and medals and for the minting of ruble coins, starting in 1828. Residues from platinum production for coinage were available in the Russian Empire, and therefore most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> them was done in Eastern Europe.|$|E

5|$|Agrilus planipennis, {{commonly}} known as the emerald ash borer, is a green buprestid or jewel beetle native to northeastern Asia that feeds on ash species. Females lay eggs in bark crevices on ash trees, and larvae feed underneath the bark of ash trees to emerge as adults in one to two years. In its native range, it is typically found at low densities and does not cause significant damage to trees native to the area. Outside its native range, it is an invasive species and is highly destructive to ash trees native to northwest Europe and North America. Prior to being found in North America, very little was known about emerald ash borer in its native range; this has resulted in much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> its biology being focused in North America. Local governments in North America are attempting to control it by monitoring its spread, diversifying tree species, insecticides, and biological control.|$|E
5|$|Cell theory led {{biologists}} to re-envision individual organisms as interdependent assemblages {{of individual}} cells. Scientists in the rising field of cytology, armed with increasingly powerful microscopes and new staining methods, soon {{found that even}} single cells were far {{more complex than the}} homogeneous fluid-filled chambers described by earlier microscopists. Robert Brown had described the nucleus in 1831, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century cytologists identified many of the key cell components: chromosomes, centrosomes mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other structures made visible through staining. Between 1874 and 1884 Walther Flemming described the discrete stages of mitosis, showing that they were not artifacts of staining but occurred in living cells, and moreover, that chromosomes doubled in number just before the cell divided and a daughter cell was produced. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> cell reproduction came together in August Weismann's theory of heredity: he identified the nucleus (in particular chromosomes) as the hereditary material, proposed the distinction between somatic cells and germ cells (arguing that chromosome number must be halved for germ cells, a precursor to the concept of meiosis), and adopted Hugo de Vries's theory of pangenes. Weismannism was extremely influential, especially in the new field of experimental embryology.|$|E

25|$|When these federal pay for {{performance}} systems failed, many were surprised {{because it had}} worked so well within the private sector. Much of this failure was attributed {{to the fact that}} most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> pay {{for performance}} had been done in the private rather than public sector. These perplexing and inconsistent results between the private and public sectors led academia to question why pay-for-performance programs in the public sector were not as effective. Research revealed that two main factors contributed to poor public sector motivation and performance: (1) the public sector has unique budgeting restrictions that make it difficult to effectively implement such a program, and (2) the type of motivation that affects employees in the federal public sector is different from the motivators that work for employees of private business firms.|$|E
25|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} concurrent computing {{started in the}} 1960s, with Dijkstra (1965) credited with being the first paper in this field, identifying and solving the mutual exclusion problem.

His foundational work on concurrency, semaphores, mutual exclusion (mutex), deadlock (deadly embrace), finding shortest paths in graphs, fault-tolerance, self-stabilization, among many other contributions comprises many of the pillars upon which the field of distributed computing is built. Shortly before his death in 2002, he received the ACM PODC Influential-Paper Award in distributed computing for his work on self-stabilization of program computation. This annual award was renamed the Dijkstra Prize (Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing) the following year, in his honor.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1996, {{pediatrician}} Leif Elinder criticized Gillberg's {{research and}} {{alleged that the}} numbers reported by Gillberg were made up. Elinder became associated with the sociologist Eva Kärfve at Lund University, whose research had been devoted to early witch hunts and medieval myths in Europe. They coordinated their criticism and Kärfve wrote a book, published in 2000, rejecting most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> DAMP, and especially Gillberg's. Other psychiatrists and neuroscientists in Sweden defended the Gillberg group and argued that Elinder and Kärfve had crossed the line from scientific criticism to personal attacks and vilification. The conflict escalated further in 2002, when Kärfve and Elinder wrote separate letters to Gothenburg University, accusing the Gillberg group of scientific misconduct. The accusations were investigated by the Ethics Council and dismissed.|$|E
