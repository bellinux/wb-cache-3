The development was started with using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. ANSYS Fluent was used to simulate preliminary designs for the burner before the final design sent to workshop to build it. The requirement of MILD combustion are air fuel mixture preheat and dilute the oxygen content in the oxidant stream. In order to achieve this condition, Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) was utilised. The burner requirement is in non-premixed and <b>open</b> <b>burner.</b> To capture and used the exhaust gas, the burner was enclosed with large circular shape wall with open at the top. External EGR pipe was used to transport the exhaust gas and mixed with the fresh oxidant (normal air or syntactic air).

This damper must be long enough to prevent from backflow of normal air into the combustion chamber. The R-type and K-type thermocouple wire was used to measure the temperature inside the combustion chamber and the EGR pipe. The lambda and gas sensor was installed to measure the gas compositions. Data acquisition system used to collect the temperature and gas compositions in combustion chamber, EGR pipe and exhaust gas.

Biodiesel {{is one of}} the hydrocarbon fuels and it has potential for external combustion. This research used biodiesel Crude Palm Oil (CPO) as fuels in which have been blend with diesel. Biodiesel Crude Palm Oil base (CPO) is free from sulfur and produced by esterification and trans-esterification reaction of vegetable oil with low molecular weight alcohol, such as ethanol or methanol. Rapid mixing injector uses for external combustion especially <b>open</b> <b>burner</b> system. Therefore, the objectives of this research are to investigate the effects of mixture formation between biodiesel and water on using rapid mixing injector and to analyze the influence of mixture formation on flame propagation and combustion characteristics together with the effect of water content on the gas emissions are analyzed. The disadvantages of CPO are high toxic emissions such as NOX and CO while it can cause the reduction on performance of burner system. However, high toxic emission can be solved by using a new concept injector with fuel-water-air premixing. The additional water in combustion process can be reduced the NOX emissions. The results of this research focuses on the mixture formation of spray, flame and exhaust gas emissions. CPO biodiesel has longer spray length and bigger spray area than diesel, but the spray angle is smaller than diesel. Based on flame image, it shows that the flame color between pure fuels and fuel-water mix fuel is totally difference compare to each other. Water mix with fuel has the brightness color and shorter flame than fuels. The exhausts gaseous tested are CO, CO 2, HC and NOX.

This sends hot combustion exhaust through the mouth into the envelope where it expands and forces some cooler air out of the mouth. This lightens the total weight of the system and increases its buoyancy, but not immediately. From the time that the burner is lit until the balloon slows or stops its descent can take 30 seconds or more, depending on its rate of descent, how cold it has become, and how powerful the burner.

Their {{performance}} is reported in terms of flame temperature and length, in order to ascertain the best ratio between primary and secondary air, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) consumption. To find the best ratio between primary and secondary air, the length and temperature of the flame were recorded {{for each of the three}} burners, examined by varying the inlet sections of the primary air and secondary air. The data on temperature and the flame length of each burner were processed using multiple regression analysis. The LPG consumption was determined with one of the burners using 10 different pressures in combination with three nozzles. The data obtained were subjected to non-linear regression using two gaseous outflow models. The various combinations of primary and secondary air inlet sections affected the values of the flame length and temperature. In general, the best combinations of primary and secondary air inlet for flame temperature did not correspond to those for flame length. However, this experiment showed that the inlet of secondary air is critical for the performance of this type of burner, in terms of flame temperature.

40|$|The {{research}} program comprises two different problems: open fires and transport of firebrands, {{which will be}} treated separately. Open Fires The investigation on open fires has been directed towards {{the study of the}} basic laws governing the process, which relate the physico-chemical properties of the fuel with the observable characteristics of a fire, such as flame temperature, flame size, convection column, radiant energy, etc A fire is a very complex process. Its study is being conducted by carrying out a series of measurements in a research facility and by studying theoretically some partial processes which are part of the over-all process. A research facility has been prepared in a tower of a test stand for aircraft engines which has been conditioned to that purpose. The research facility comprises several cylindrical <b>open</b> vessels (<b>burners)</b> of different diameters, for studying the fires produced by several types of fuels. The fuel is kept at a constant level in the burners and the fuel consumption is measured by means of a constant-pressure volumetric system. Thermocouples and pressure probes are placed in and around the fire to measure temperatures, and velocities of the gases. Burning rates, flame temperatures, flame sizes, fuel temperatures, gas velocities, etc, are being measured for gasoline, kerosene and for dioxane-water mixtures. The dioxane is a fuel which mixes with water in all proportions and it has a similar boiling temperature than that of the water. Therefore, dioxane-water mixtures keep a constant composition during combustion and by varying the amount of water of the mixture it is possible to change in a continuous form the properties of the fire.

40|$|For heating {{purposes}} in modern households, gas burners are normally applied {{due to their}} simplicity, low cost and easy handling.

While much research has been conducted into the air-pollution problem in Christchurch to date, this research has focused on physical contaminants and their effects on health, rather than on the ways in which air pollution is socially and culturally mediated and on the sense-making practices of those who create pollution and suffer its effects. Based on information drawn from focus groups, we argue that reluctance to change behaviour results partly from investments in particular cultural identities which are tied into hegemonic masculinities and understandings of national identity, such as the masculine pioneer heritage established during the colonial period. We also explore the spatial relationships that air pollution plays out within and on the ‘body’ and how it transcends and weakens the bounded body. We believe that analyses which draw on theories of hybridisation, embodiment, identity, and discourse, and which highlight the links between modes of behaviour, identity and sense of place, and the interactions between humans and nonhumans, are able to shed new light on our understandings of public perceptions and responses to air pollution in Christchurch. ...|$|R
40|$|Catalyzed {{combustion}} {{offers the}} advantages of increased fuel efficiency, decreased emissions (both NOx and CO), and an expanded operating range. These performance improvements {{are related to the}} ability of the catalyst to stabilize a flame at or within the burner media and to combust fuel at much lower temperatures. This technology has a diverse set of applications in industrial and commercial heating, including boilers for the paper, food and chemical industries. However, wide spread adoption of catalyzed combustion has been limited by the high cost of precious metals needed for the catalyst materials. The primary objective of this project was the development of an innovative catalyzed burner media for commercial and small industrial boiler applications that drastically reduce the unit cost of the catalyzed media without sacrificing the benefits associated with catalyzed combustion. The scope of this program was to identify both the optimum substrate material as well as the best performing catalyst construction to meet or exceed industry standards for durability, cost, energy efficiency, and emissions. It was anticipated that commercial implementation of this technology would result in significant energy savings and reduced emissions. Based on demonstrated achievements, there is a potential to reduce NOx emissions by 40, 000 TPY and natural gas consumption by 8. 9 TBtu in industries that heavily utilize natural gas for process heating. These industries include food manufacturing, polymer processing, and pulp and paper manufacturing. Initial evaluation of commercial solutions and upcoming EPA regulations suggests that small to midsized boilers in industrial and commercial markets could possibly see the greatest benefit from this technology. While out of scope for the current program, an extension of this technology could also be applied to catalytic oxidation for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Considerable progress has been made {{over the course of the}} grant period in accomplishing these objectives. Our work in the area of Pd-based, methane oxidation catalysts has led to the development of highly active catalysts with relatively low loadings of Pd metal using proprietary coating methods. The thermal stability of these Pd-based catalysts were characterized using SEM and BET analyses, further demonstrating that certain catalyst supports offer enhanced stability toward both PdO decomposition and/or thermal sintering/growth of Pd particles. When applied to commercially available fiber mesh substrates (both metallic and ceramic) and tested in an open-air burner, these catalyst-support chemistries showed modest improvements in the NOx emissions and radiant output compared to uncatalyzed substrates. More significant, though, was the performance of the catalyst-support chemistries on novel media substrates. These substrates were developed to overcome the limitations that are present with commercially available substrate designs and increase the gas-catalyst contact time. When catalyzed, these substrates demonstrated a 65 - 75 % reduction in NOx emissions across the firing range when tested in an <b>open</b> air <b>burner.</b> In testing in a residential boiler, this translated into NOx emissions of < 15 ppm over the 15 - 150 kBtu/hr firing range...|$|R
