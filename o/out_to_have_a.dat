5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site {{started up the}} B Reactor, {{the first of its}} three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products {{might turn out to be}} nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut down, and then just as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> neutron capture cross-section of well over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods to burn out the poison.|$|E

25|$|In April 1963, {{toxicity}} {{tests for}} pronethalol showed results of thymic tumours in mice. Nevertheless, it was launched under the trade name Alderlin, {{as the first}} clinically useful β-blocker. The launch took place in November 1963 when many small-scale clinical trials had proved their effectiveness in angina and certain types of arrhythmias. Pronethalol was only marketed for use in life-threatening situations. Dr. James Black went on to create another β-blocker, called propranolol; a non-selective β-blocker. Clinical trials started {{in the summer of}} 1964 and a year later, propranolol was launched under the trade name Inderal, only {{two and a half years}} after it had first been tested. It turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> higher potency than pronethalol, with fewer side effects. Propranolol became the first major drug in the treatment of angina pectoris, since the introduction of coronary vasodilators, (such as nitroglycerin), almost 100 years earlier. Propranolol became a best-selling drug, used to treat a wide range of cardiovascular diseases such as arrhythmia, hypertension and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.|$|E
25|$|The {{main problem}} {{of the use of}} FISH to study the {{chromosomal}} constitution of embryos is the elevated mosaicism rate observed at the human preimplantation stage. A meta-analysis of more than 800 embryos came to the result that approximately 75% of preimplantation embryos are mosaic, of which approximately 60% are diploid–aneuploid mosaic and approximately 15% aneuploid mosaic. Li and co-workers found that 40% of the embryos diagnosed as aneuploid on day 3 turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> euploid inner cell mass at day 6. Staessen and collaborators found that 17.5% of the embryos diagnosed as abnormal during PGS, and subjected to post-PGD reanalysis, were found to also contain normal cells, and 8.4% were found grossly normal. As a consequence, it has been questioned whether the one or two cells studied from an embryo are actually representative of the complete embryo, and whether viable embryos are not being discarded due to the limitations of the technique.|$|E

The two higher denominations appeared late in this issue as the Bureau of Engraving and Printing was busy replacing worn printing plates and dealing with various experiments and innovations that delayed production of the 2 & 5 dollar plates. Perhaps to identify these stamps as luxury items, they were printed in two tones, with the vignette head in black and the frame in color. They were further distinguished from lower values by their use of landscape format rather than the normal portrait orientation. Because the 2 & 5 dollar Franklin-head stamps were the two largest denominations they are often referred to by collectors as the 'Big Bens'. The 2-dollar Franklin {{was intended to be}} printed in carmine-red and black, but somehow the color of the printing ink from the particular lot that was used turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> distinct orange tone.

In 1920 a second printing of the 2-dollar Franklin was issued, this time with the colors that were originally intended, carmine-red and black.
