5|$|Although {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced}} to Europe in the 14thcentury, it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15thcentury, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls. While castles continued to be built well into the 16thcentury, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live. As a result, true castles went into decline and were replaced by artillery forts with no role in civil administration, and country houses that were indefensible. From the 18thcentury onwards, there was {{a renewed interest in}} castles with the construction of mock castles, part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>romantic</b> revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no military purpose.|$|E

5|$|The Joker is {{alternatively}} {{depicted as}} sexual and asexual. In The Dark Knight Returns and Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the Joker is seductive toward Batman; {{it is uncertain}} if their relationship has homoerotic undertones or if the Joker is simply trying to manipulate his nemesis. Frank Miller interpreted the character as fixated on death and uninterested in sexual relationships, while Robinson believes that the Joker is capable <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>romantic</b> relationship. His relationship with Harley Quinn is abusively paradoxical; although the Joker keeps her at his side, he heedlessly harms her (for example, throwing her out a window without seeing if she survives). Harley loves him but the Joker does not reciprocate her feelings, chiding her for distracting him from other plans.|$|E
5|$|The four windows {{from the}} Tiffany studios include those {{donated by the}} college's Class of 1899 and Class of 1900.

According to Rutgers, this window was a gift of the Tiffany studios. Weston, the grandson of Henry Latimer Janeway (1824–1909)a wealthy wallpaper manufacturer, Rutgers alumnus (A.B. 1844, A.M. 1847) and long-serving trustee (1862–1909)killed himself after his family became aware <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>romantic</b> relationship with a woman that would have negatively affected his reputation.|$|E

The priory buildings were demolished and the stone re-used in other buildings in Guisborough. The east end of the priory church was left standing with its great window forming a distinctive arch, a well-known landmark used as a symbol for Guisborough. It {{became part of the}} estate of the Chaloner family, who acquired it in 1550. The east window was preserved by them as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Romantic</b> vista adjoining their seat, Gisborough Hall, from which the priory takes its idiosyncratically spelled name.

5|$|Poppy Meadow is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Rachel Bright. She {{was introduced by}} executive producer Bryan Kirkwood on 11 January 2011 as the best friend of established character Jodie Gold (Kylie Babbington) in scenes filling in for those cut from a controversial baby-swap storyline. Poppy returned to the series in June 2011 as a supporting character and comedy element, {{in a move that}} was generally welcomed by the tabloid press; her storylines focused on her friendship with Jodie and their intertwined love lives. Both Jodie and Poppy left the series on 14 November 2011, but the possibility was left open for Poppy to return in the future. In June 2012 Bright reprised her role as Poppy, moving into Walford and resuming her employment at the local beauty salon, this time as a regular character. Poppy's storylines became more prominent, her sister Tansy (Daisy Wood-Davis) was introduced, along with the development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>romantic</b> relationship with Fatboy (Ricky Norwood).

5|$|Scotland {{is known}} for its {{dramatically}} placed castles and towers, which have become an accepted part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>romantic</b> landscape. Castles, tower houses, peel towers and royal palaces of the period all contributed {{to the development of the}} unique style known as the Scots baronial that would be used for estate houses in Scotland in the sixteenth century, and which would be revived and used extensively from the nineteenth century, including the royal residence at Balmoral and then exported across the world. The Reformation in the mid-sixteenth century would lead to the rejection of many features of Medieval churches, resulting in the widespread destruction of Medieval church furnishings, ornaments and decoration, and would usher in new architectural forms. However, they would be revived from the 1850s to the 1890s, when large Gothic revival churches were built in considerable numbers for all the major denominations.|$|E

25|$|As a {{lover of}} Woman and Nature Winther is {{perhaps one of the}} Danish authors who is most closely {{connected}} to the concept <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>romantic</b> poet.

25|$|This idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>romantic</b> {{universal}} poesy {{can be seen}} {{clearly in}} the romantic triad. This theoretical structure always shows its recipient that the described moment is exactly the moment (kairos) in which the future is decided. These frequently mentioned critical points correspond with the artist’s feeling for the present, which Novalis shares with many other contemporaries of his time. Thus a triadic structure {{can be found in}} most of his works. This means that there are three corresponding structural elements which are written differently concerning the content and the form.|$|E
