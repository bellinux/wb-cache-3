40|$|Recent {{regulatory}} efforts from EASA {{introduced the}} new {{concept of a}} specific category that allows a stepwise adaptation of certification requirements. Based on a specific operation risk assessment, this category enables new aircraft system architectures and mission designs. The concept allows for operational restrictions, defined {{in the concept of}} operations, to maintain overall operation safety. Therefore, the description of the concept of operations {{is one of the key}} elements for the approval of a UAS operation. This description will be used by pilots, <b>operators,</b> <b>certification</b> authorities and possibly additional stakeholders, e. g., for publishing operation into databases. Standardization of this document seems mandatory. In addition to this, we discuss the formalization of this document for easy distribution amongst stakeholders and establishment of tool support. To support this, we use recent developments regarding standardization of simulation modeling. The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Modeling and Simulation Technical Committee recently launched a working group towards the development of a standard scenario definition language for aviation. In this paper, we extend this language specification in order to define specific operation safety boundaries of a system. Thereby, we aim at creating a dialect of the simulation scenario definition language that can be used to describe safe scenarios for a particular system of interest. We further discuss the challenges and benefits of such a formalization of the concept of operations by adapting the simulation scenario definition language...|$|R
