5|$|By {{the time}} of the act of Union, the Kingdom of Scotland had a {{standing}} army of seven units of infantry, two of horse and one troop of Horse Guards, besides varying levels of fortress artillery in the garrison castles of Edinburgh, Dumbarton, and Stirling. Their role was of such importance that the Scots Parliament forced Queen Anne to give royal assent to the controversial 1704 Act of Security by threatening to withdraw Scottish forces back out of the Confederate armies. The new British Army created by the Act of Union in 1707 incorporated existing Scottish regiments, such as the Scots Guards, The Royal Scots 1st <b>of</b> <b>Foot,</b> King's Own Scottish Borderers 25th <b>of</b> <b>Foot,</b> The Cameronians 26th <b>of</b> <b>Foot,</b> Scots Greys and the Royal Scots Fusiliers 21st <b>of</b> <b>Foot.</b> The new armed forces were controlled by the War Office and Admiralty from London. During this period, Scottish soldiers and sailors were instrumental in supporting the expansion of the British Empire and became involved in international conflicts, including the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–13), the Quadruple Alliance (1718–20), wars with Spain (1727–29) and (1738–48) and the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–48). The first official Highland regiment to be raised for the British army was the Black Watch, the 43rd (later 42nd) regiment, in 1740. It marked the beginning of a major role for Highlanders within the British military structure, but the growth of Highland regiments was delayed by the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion and would not begin in earnest until the late 1750s.|$|E

In determining the suitable <b>of</b> <b>footing</b> to loadings, design criteria should function according to the soil and types of structures erected on it.

Manley Power {{followed}} in his forefather's footsteps and was a career soldier, starting as an ensign in his father's old regiment, the 20th Regiment <b>of</b> <b>Foot,</b> on 27 August 1783, when he was either 9 or 10 years old. He served in Halifax, Nova Scotia (1795–97), Holland (1799), and Menorca (1800).

5|$|Byron's {{attack on}} Skippon's musketeers in the centre also went poorly. Pushing three regiments <b>of</b> <b>foot</b> forward, the force {{suffered}} similarly high casualties {{in an attempt}} to take Round Hill; after the attack stalled, the cavalry had to be called in to force it forward. Despite heavy losses due to the only avenue of advance being a narrow lane lined with Parliamentarian musketeers, this move succeeded in allowing Byron to take Round Hill, forcing the Parliamentarian infantry back to a hedge on the far side. The attack eventually lost momentum, and although Round Hill was taken, Byron was unable to advance any further. On the right flank, William Vavasour attempted to overwhelm the Parliamentary flank with a substantial brigade <b>of</b> <b>foot,</b> which included a small amount of cavalry support. His initial attack was repulsed thanks to the Parliamentarian artillery opening fire, but a subsequent head-on attack forced Skippon's beleaguered force in the centre to send several regiments over to assist, with the fight turning into a bloody melee. Vavasour's force was eventually forced to retire, with the Parliamentarians failing to give ground.|$|E
