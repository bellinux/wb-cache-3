5|$|For Steiner, all of offers, {{threats and}} throffers affect the {{practical}} deliberations of their recipient {{in the same}} way. What is significant for {{the subject of the}} intervention is not {{the extent to which the}} consequences <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> or noncompliance differ in desirability from the norm, but the extent to which they differ in desirability from each other. Thus, an offer does not necessarily exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention depends upon the difference in desirability between compliance and noncompliance alone, regardless of the manner of the intervention.|$|E

40|$|Considerable {{evidence}} suggests that enforcement efforts cannot fully explain the high degree <b>of</b> tax <b>compliance.</b> To resolve this puzzle <b>of</b> tax <b>compliance,</b> several researchers have argued that citizens' attitudes toward paying taxes, defined as tax morale, helps to explain the high degree <b>of</b> tax <b>compliance.</b> However, most studies have treated tax morale as a black box, without discussing which factors shape it.

5|$|As {{part of the}} US Department of Labor’s (DOL) governmentwide {{implementation}} of the Davis-Bacon Act, federal regulations require that all laborers and mechanics who work for a contractor or subcontractor on federally financed construction contracts over $2,000 must be paid wages not less than those the DOL established for the project location (i.e., the prevailing wage). This Compliance Requirement was created to assure that recipients oblige contractors {{to comply with the}} Davis-Bacon Act, by including in their construction contracts with a contractor or subcontractor a clause or requirement to comply with the Davis-Bacon Act and the DOL regulations. The clause should also include a requirement for the contractor or subcontractor to submit to the recipient weekly (e.g., for each week in which any contract work is performed) a copy of the construction payroll accompanied by statement <b>of</b> <b>compliance.</b> This report is commonly referred to as “certified payrolls”, and is often done using Optional Form WH-347 (OMB No. 1215-0149), a standard form pre-designed by the OMB.|$|E

5|$|Primary {{resistance}} {{occurs when}} a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack <b>of</b> <b>compliance),</b> or using low-quality medication. Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three {{or more of the}} six classes of second-line drugs. Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs. It was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012, and has also been found in Iran and India. Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB.|$|E

There are not mandatory fines for smoking transgressions, although the newest 2016 anti-smoking campaign has seen fines issued and offenders threatened with images of them being broadcast on TV. Tobacco packaging warning messages are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in any way. They are usually printed in small print {{on the side of}} the package and only state that smoking is harmful to health. However, the descriptions must state the nicotine and tar content, must not be misleading and do need to be approved by local authorities.

5|$|Steiner {{differentiated}} offers, {{threats and}} throffers {{based on the}} preferability <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> and noncompliance for the subject {{when compared to the}} normal course of events that would have come about were no intervention made. Steiner's account was criticised by philosopher Robert Stevens, who instead suggested that what was important in differentiating the kinds of intervention was whether performing or not performing the requested action was more or less preferable {{than it would have been}} were no intervention made. Throffers form part of the wider moral and political considerations of coercion, and form part of the question of the possibility of coercive offers. Contrary to received wisdom that only threats can be coercive, throffers lacking explicit threats have been cited as an example of coercive offers, while some writers argue that offers, threats and throffers may all be coercive if certain conditions are met. For others, by contrast, if a throffer is coercive, it is explicitly the threat aspect that makes it so, and not all throffers can be considered coercive.|$|E

5|$|Until its repeal, most {{extensions}} to {{copyright law}} were based around provisions {{found in the}} Statute of Anne. The one successful bill from the lobbying in the 1730s, which came into force on 29 September 1739, extended the provision prohibiting the import of foreign books to also prohibit the import of books that, while originally published in Britain, were being reprinted in foreign nations and then shipped to England and Wales. This was intended to stop the influx of cheap books from Ireland, and also repealed the price restrictions in the Statute of Anne. Another alteration was over the legal deposit provisions of the Statute, which many booksellers found unfair. Despite an initial period <b>of</b> <b>compliance,</b> the principle of donating copies of books to certain libraries lapsed, {{partly due to the}} unwieldiness of the statute's provisions and partly {{because of a lack of}} cooperation by the publishers. In 1775 Lord North, who was Chancellor of the University of Oxford, succeeded in passing a bill that reiterated the legal deposit provisions and granted the universities perpetual copyright on their works.|$|E

At the same time, the California Franchise Tax Board reported that the same corporation owed more than $4,743.40 in taxes, fines, and associated penalties in the state of California for 2003 through 2007, because the corporation did not file tax returns in the state for those years. A Franken representative said that it followed the advice of an accountant who believed when the corporation stopped doing business in California that no further filing was required. Subsequently, Franken paid $70,000 in back income taxes in 17 states dating back to 2003, mostly from his speeches and other paid appearances. Franken said he paid the income tax in his state of residence, and he would seek retroactive credit for paying the taxes in the wrong states.|$|E
