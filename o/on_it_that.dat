5|$|By September, {{the game}} was still unfinished, and almost every Williams {{programmer}} assisted in meeting the deadline for the AMOA trade show. The evening before the trade show, the arcade cabinets were delivered for display. The developers, however, forgot to create an attract mode—an automated sequence designed to entice an audience to play—for the game, and began working <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> night. Early the next morning, the team created the final EPROM chips for the mode and installed them in cabinets. The chips, however, did not work and the designers made additional attempts to correct the problem. Once the attract mode was operational, Jarvis and the team returned to their homes {{to prepare for the}} show. After the show, the developers expanded the game to allow users to play indefinitely. The display model featured five levels, which the team felt was more than enough because of the game's difficulty. Most Williams employees could not progress past the third level and Jarvis's score of 60,000points seemed unbeatable to them. The developers decided it was best to be prepared for players that might exceed their expectations and added more levels that repeated.|$|E
5|$|Several Malaysian Members of Parliament {{have urged}} the Federal Government to assert {{sovereignty}} over Pulau Pisang {{which also has}} a lighthouse <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> is operated by Singapore, or to take over administration of the lighthouse. Concerns were also expressed for Pulau Merambong near the western boundary of Malaysia and Singapore. The Menteri Besar of Johor, Abdul Ghani Othman, assured the public that Pulau Pisang belongs to Johor under a 1900 agreement between Sultan Ibrahim of Johor and British administrators in colonial Singapore. Nonetheless, Malaysian agencies have taken up efforts to stake claims over a hundred islands, reefs, rocks and other features in the South China Sea, Malacca Straits, and off Sabahan waters that Malaysia could lose to China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Two of these islands are Pulau Unarang off eastern Sabah near the Indonesian border, and Pulau Perak {{to the west of}} Penang.|$|E
5|$|Wooden carvings in {{the shape}} of hawks, ancient gods, serpents and turtles are also popular. The Grand Huts, also known as grande case (chef's hut), are {{decorated}} with the filial of fleche faitiere representing the ancestral spirits, symbolic of transition between the world of the dead and the world of the living. The wood carving is shaped like the spear-like carving that adorns the top of the grande case. It comprises three parts; the flat crowned face representing the ancestor with a long, the rounded pole run through by conch shells mounted <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> represents the ancestor’s voice, and a base with the pole fixed to it to symbolise the link between the clan and the chief. The central piece is also flanked by wooden pieces with sharp points (facing downwards) that are intended to prevent bad spirits enveloping the ancestor in the central part. As it represented the power of the chiefs over their subjects, it was adopted as flag of the Kanaks by the organization leading the independent movement in New Caledonia. The arrow or the spear normally has a needle at the end to insert threaded shells from bottom to top. After the death of a Kanak chief, the fleche faitière is removed and his family takes it to their home. Though it was allowed to be used again as a sign of respect it is normally kept at burial grounds of noted citizens or at the mounds of abandoned grand houses.|$|E

25|$|The {{results of}} his {{observations}} did not fit Ptolemy's model at all. Concluding that the model was inadequate, Gersonides tried (unsuccessfully) to improve <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> <b>That</b> challenge was finally answered, of course, by Copernicus three centuries later, but Gersonides {{was the first to}} falsify the Alexandrian dogma - the first known instance of modern falsification philosophy. Levi also showed that Ptolemy's model for the Lunar orbit, though reproducing correctly the evolution of the Moon's position, fails completely in predicting the apparent sizes of the Moon in its motion. Unfortunately, {{there is no evidence that}} the findings influenced later generations of astronomers, even though Gersonides' writings were translated and available.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Wurlitzer {{released}} an electro-mechanical drum machine called the Side Man, {{which was the}} first-ever commercially produced drum machine. The Side Man {{was intended as a}} percussive accompaniment for the Wurlitzer organ range. The Side Man offered a choice of 12 electronically generated, predefined rhythm patterns with variable tempos. The sound source was a series of vacuum tubes which created 10 preset electronic drum sounds. The drum sounds were 'sequenced' by a rotating wiper arm with contact brushes <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> swept around a phenolic panel with corresponding contacts arranged in a pattern of concentric circles across its face; these were spaced in certain patterns to generate parts of a particular rhythm. Combinations of these different sets of rhythms and drum sounds created popular rhythmic patterns of the day, e.g. waltzes, fox trots etc. These combinations were selected by a rotary knob {{on the top of the}} Side Man box. The tempo of the patterns was controlled by a slider that increased the speed of rotation of the wiper arm. The Side Man had a panel of 10 buttons for manually triggering drum sounds, and a remote player to control the machine while playing from an organ keyboard. The Side Man was housed in a mahogany cabinet that contained the sound-generating circuitry, amplifier and speaker.|$|E
25|$|Act One {{told the}} story of DNA as a thing that makes human {{different}} and understand each other, Act two {{told the story}} of how children use their dream to imagine, Act three {{told the story of}} how Youths use dream to express themselves, Act four told the story of how family support become an inspiration for athletes and coaches to achieve success in sports. While Act 5, the conclusion told the story of how Singaporean athletes welcome, make friends and unite with the athletes other country of Southeast Asia regardless of language, race and belief. Soon after the last act, the torch of the Games was carried into the stadium from a dragon boat across the Kallang basin by several Singapore’s former and current generation of sportsmen and sportswomen. The current sportsmen are Clement Teo of Dragon Boat, Liang Xiaoyu of Badminton, Muhammad Naqib Asmin of Athletics, Gabriel Yang of Judo, Dinah Chan of Cycling, Enrico Marican of Hockey, Shanti Pereira of Athletics, Derek Wong Zi Liang of Badminton, while the former sportsmen are Annabel Pennefather of Hockey, Prema Govindran of Athletics and Wong Shoon Keat of Badminton. The cauldron was lit by former football sportsman, Fandi Ahmad and his son and current football sportsman, Irfan Fandi. The cauldron’s design was inspired by the DNA which represents the unity of nations, communities and individuals of Southeast Asia. It is made of stainless steel, 19.2-metre-high and has a LED screen <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> displays information such as the time and weather during the Games. It also has a burner that able to project a 1.5m- to 4m-high flame and 11 bars within the structure that represent the different countries participating at the Games. A colourful fireworks display then erupted over the skyline surrounding the National Stadium, signalling the official commencement of the Games. The ceremony concludes with the President leaving the stadium.|$|E
