Some {{of the effects}} created by Lazur would rely <b>on</b> <b>software</b> programming rather than the Nintendo 64 hardware, as the latter would not be capable of rendering them directly. The second mode would be a full 3D mode played in either regular or high display resolution, and would feature different level of detail textures depending on camera distances, to maximize clarity and performance. Both modes {{would be in a}} top-down perspective, although more cinematic camera angles, similar to those from , were also considered for the 3D mode.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the series, Zima and Dita, persocom {{agents for}} the Japanese {{government}} who know the outcome of Chi's special program, arrive at Hideki's apartment. A minor scuffle ensues between Dita and Chi, before Zima restrains Dita, wishing to see the outcome of Hideki's decision and ultimately too falling under Chi's influence. Hideki confirms his love for Chi, only to find that Freya has taken control of her body. Learning that he that he can never engage in sexual intercourse with Chi without rebooting her systems, erasing everything that makes her a unique individual, Hideki states that he will love Chi regardless. Freya confirms that while Chi and herself are indeed the legendary Chobits, they possess neither sentience nor emotions, but rely <b>on</b> <b>software</b> programs just like every persocom. Again, Hideki stands by his love for Chi. Hideki declines her offer to tell him about Chi's special ability, and Freya vanishes after imploring him {{to take care of her}} sister. Chi awakens, embracing Hideki. The series ends with Chi holding Hideki's hand with visible rings Chi had chosen for the two of them.|$|E

Firstly, the 3 D model of the part and the injection mould structure were designed based <b>on</b> SolidWorks <b>software.</b> Secondly, the injection molding progress was analyzed and simulated based <b>on</b> Moldflow <b>software.</b> Finally, the toolpaths of cavity and core were designed based <b>on</b> MasterCAM <b>software,</b> and its manufacture process and numerical control programming was simulated. The period of product development was shortened effectively {{and the quality of}} design and manufacture was improved by CAD/CAE/CAM integrated technology...|$|R
