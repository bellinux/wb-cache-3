In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at a press conference to re-assert his authority and to urge people to trust the government and the collapsing Rupiah. However, his attempts to re-instill confidence had little effect.

5|$|On 24 October, the IMF {{tentatively}} {{agreed to}} lend €1.58 billion. However the loan had still not {{been approved by}} the Executive Board <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> on 13 November. Due to the delay Iceland found itself caught in a classic catch-22 situation, loans from other countries could not be secured until the IMF program had been approved. The Icelandic government spoke of a $500M (€376M) gap in the funding plans. Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos stated that the Netherlands would oppose the loan unless agreement was reached over deposit insurance for Landsbanki customers in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|A second {{important}} {{factor is the}} success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> Stand-By-Arrangement in the country since November 2008. The SBA includes three pillars. The first pillar is a program of medium term fiscal consolidation, involving painful austerity measures and significant tax hikes. The result has been that central government debts have been stabilised at around 80–90 percent of GDP. A second pillar is the resurrection of a viable but sharply downsized domestic banking system on the ruins of its gargantuan international banking system which the government was unable to bail out. A third pillar is the enactment of capital controls and the work to gradually lift these to restore normal financial linkages with the outside world. An important result of the emergency legislation and the SBA is {{that the country has}} not been seriously affected by the European sovereign debt crisis from 2010. Despite a contentious debate with Britain and the Netherlands over the question of a state guarantee on the Icesave deposits of Landsbanki in these countries, credit default swaps on Icelandic sovereign debt have steadily declined from over 1000 points prior to the crash in 2008 to around 200 points in June 2011. The fact that the assets of the failed Landsbanki branches are now estimated to cover most of the depositor claims has had an influence to ease concerns over the situation.|$|E

While <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> charges borrowers roughly what it pays its creditor members for the resources used in its regular lending operations, its overhead costs (administrative budget plus addition to reserves) are shared between <b>the</b> two groups <b>of</b> members in a less equitable manner. With overhead costs rising inexorably to meet the increasing number and range of responsibilities being placed on the institution – largely at <b>the</b> instance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>IMF‘s</b> principal creditors by virtue of their dominant majority of voting power – <b>the</b> under-representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>IMF’s</b> debtors undermines <b>the</b> legitimacy <b>of</b> its decision making.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a key element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>IMF’s</b> agenda for change: <b>the</b> {{repackaging}} <b>of</b> its economics of crisis around inflation targeting. It examines how this new policy regime redefines <b>the</b> political economy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>IMF’s</b> policy advice, and contextualizes it by focusing on Eastern Europe, the region worst affected by the global financial crisis which began in 2007. The paper compares the conditionalities designed under the new and old policy regimes and argues that <b>the</b> mainstreaming <b>of</b> inflation targeting reproduces <b>the</b> <b>IMF’s</b> function within a neoliberal political economy. It points to {{a difference in the}} manner in which models inform policy advice, depending on <b>the</b> <b>IMF’s</b> role in <b>the</b> policy process. During ‘normal’ times, models engender a contractionary bias that favours speculative capital. When acting as ‘lender <b>of</b> last resort’, <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> retains <b>the</b> traditional emphasis on fiscal contractions, paying but lip service to its new economics of crisis while further ignoring crucial questions of macroeconomic policy coordination or <b>the</b> destabilizing potential <b>of</b> short-term capital inflow...|$|R
