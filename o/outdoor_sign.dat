25|$|In 1977, the Knowland Family {{sold the}} Oakland Tribune to Combined Communications Corporation, owned by Arizona-based <b>outdoor</b> <b>sign</b> mogul Karl Eller. The Tribune Publishing Corporation, was {{dissolved}} by the Knowland Family. Eller had recently acquired The Cincinnati Enquirer. In 1979, CCC {{merged with the}} East Coast-based media conglomerate Gannett, and the Tribune was thus acquired by Gannett. That year, Allen H. Neuharth, Gannett CEO, used the Tribune as a pilot project with a new morning paper called Eastbay TODAY, which served as an early prototype of Gannett's later national paper USA TODAY. In 1979, Gannett named Robert C. Maynard (1937–1993) editor, becoming the first African-American editor in the paper's history. In 1983, Maynard—who by this time had become publisher and with Gannett's blessing—consolidated the Tribune and Eastbay TODAY into a single morning newspaper under the Tribune name.|$|E
25|$|Even though Sandridge had {{no formal}} {{training}} or art education, his intuitively unique style and hand painted talent of billboards {{caught the attention}} of The Coca-Cola Company in the early 1970s. Working for an <b>outdoor</b> <b>sign</b> company, Sandridge painted a realistically, eye-catching image of Niagara Falls featuring the iconic Coca-Cola bottle and logo design on a 14ft x 48ft billboard. So popular was the sight that the billboard won an award, prompting representatives from The Coca-Cola Company to drive from Atlanta, Georgia, to Gadsden, Alabama, to preview Sandridge's artwork. Feeling proud of the attention his craftsmanship had attracted, Sandridge recognized that the weight of the adverse racial overtones of the time would not allow him the recognition he deserved. He was not even given a formal introduction to the men who were captivated by his work. But not one to sit idly by and accept racism or tolerate blatant disrespect towards his work ethic and creative abilities, he soon left that company.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 This thesis {{focuses on}} an {{analysis}} of billboards which exist as the common thread on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, weaving together its many fragmentary qualities. By responding to the abundance of billboards on Wilshire {{as part of the}} unavoidable media driven culture of Los Angeles, the project aims to show how their layering within the city adds depth and creates rhythms on the street, as well as how the visual message they convey can be further utilized as a meaningful expression of individuality, cultural relevance, and spatial experience. Overall, the project seeks to transform the notion of traditional building and <b>outdoor</b> <b>sign</b> relationships in an effort to celebrate the ways these seemingly mundane urban conditions along Wilshire boulevard can successfully allow for meaningful and dynamic public interaction...|$|E
