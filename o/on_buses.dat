5|$|After the September 11, 2001 {{terrorist}} attacks, government {{scrutiny of}} train and airplane passengers substantially increased, but bus passengers are largely free of it.

50|$|The three {{spin-off}} {{films were}} produced by Hammer Film Productions. They are <b>On</b> the <b>Buses</b> (1971), Mutiny <b>on</b> the <b>Buses</b> (1972), and Holiday <b>on</b> the <b>Buses</b> (1973), {{set in a}} holiday camp. <b>On</b> the <b>Buses</b> became Britain's top box office film of 1971.|$|R

5|$|Until 1958, trams {{formed a}} network {{spanning}} most of Adelaide, {{with a history}} dating back to 1878. Adelaide ran horse trams from 1878 to 1914 and electric trams from 1909, but has primarily relied <b>on</b> <b>buses</b> for public transport since 1958. Electric trams and trolleybuses were Adelaide's main public transport throughout {{the life of the}} electric tram network. All trams except the Glenelg tram were closed in the 1950s. The Glenelg tram remains in operation and was upgraded and extended in 2007-2010.|$|E
5|$|Belgrade has an {{extensive}} public transport system based <b>on</b> <b>buses</b> (118 urban lines {{and more than}} 300 suburban lines), trams (12 lines), and trolleybuses (8 lines). It is run by GSP Beograd and SP Lasta, in cooperation with private companies on various bus routes. The BusPlus ticketing system based on contactless smart cards began operating in February 2012. Belgrade also has a S-train network, BG Voz, now run by the city government (previous commuter railway network, Beovoz, was abolished around 2013). The main railway station connects Belgrade with other European capitals and many towns in Serbia. Travel by coach is also popular, and the capital is well-served with daily connections to every town in Serbia and to many other European destinations through the central bus station.|$|E

50|$|That {{same year}} Hare came to {{national}} {{attention in the}} role of Mrs Butler in <b>On</b> the <b>Buses,</b> taking over the part from Cicely Courtneidge in the second series of the ITV comedy. The series ran until 1973 and spawned three spin-off films <b>On</b> the <b>Buses</b> (1971), Mutiny <b>on</b> the <b>Buses</b> (1972) and Holiday <b>on</b> the <b>Buses</b> (1973) in which Hare recreated her small-screen role.

5|$|In 2014, Transport for London {{suggested}} that pedestrianisation {{may not be}} a suitable long-term measure due to Crossrail reducing the demand for bus services along Oxford Street, and proposed to ban all traffic except buses and cycles during peak shopping times. Optimisation of existing traffic signals along the street, including Pedestrian Countdown signals, have also been proposed. Transport for London is concerned that in the long term traffic problems may affect trade on Oxford Street, which is now competing with shopping centres such as Westfield London, Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross shopping centre. In 2015, while campaigning for election as London Mayor, Labour's Sadiq Khan favoured the full pedestrianisation of Oxford Street, which was supported by other parties. After winning the election, he pledged the street would be completely pedestrianised by 2020, including a ban <b>on</b> <b>buses</b> and taxis. By 2017, this had been revised forward {{to the end of the}} following year.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August 2009, U Car Share started {{providing}} carsharing {{services with}} public {{pick up and}} drop off stops at several different TRAX stations {{as well as the}} University of Utah campus. Three secured bicycle lockers are also located on the facility, but must be rented from UTA in advance for an annual fee. Three ticket machines are located on the platform that provide single-ride, round trip, and all day passes, as well as family and discounted fare tickets. The ticket machines are cash-only and provide change in dollar coins and quarters only. TRAX ticket machines used to accept UTA fare tokens, which are still accepted <b>on</b> <b>buses.</b> On 1 September 2008 UTA discontinued the use of tokens at TRAX machines due to increased fraud.|$|E
5|$|Reihl-Kir and Džaja {{concluded}} that a party {{should be sent to}} Borovo Selo, and Šoškoćanin agreed to grant the police safe passage under a white flag. However, when the force of between 20 and 30 policemen entered Borovo Selo under the white flag, they were ambushed by paramilitaries and members of a local militia. Approximately 150 police arrived from Osijek and Vinkovci <b>on</b> <b>buses</b> and were deployed as reinforcements. The force dispatched from Vinkovci entered Borovo Selo and was ambushed, while the reinforcements sent from Osijek via Dalj were stopped at a roadblock north of Borovo Selo and failed to enter the village. A firefight ensued and lasted until 2:30p.m., when seven JNA armoured personnel carriers (APCs) moved into the village from Dalj. Another convoy of APCs deployed by the JNA through Borovo Naselje, just south of Borovo Selo, was stopped by a crowd of Croat women who refused to let them through.|$|E

50|$|Karen is {{best remembered}} {{for her role}} in the LWT sitcom <b>On</b> the <b>Buses</b> (1969-73). In this series, Karen played Olive, the dowdy bespectacled younger sister of Stan (Reg Varney), and wife of Arthur Rudge (Michael Robbins). She also {{appeared}} in the film spin-offs, <b>On</b> the <b>Buses</b> (1971), Mutiny <b>on</b> the <b>Buses</b> (1972), and Holiday <b>on</b> the <b>Buses</b> (1973). From 1977 to 1978, Karen reprised the role of Olive in the LWT revival of the sitcom The Rag Trade created by the same writers.|$|R
50|$|Hammer Films had {{commercial}} success with some atypical output during this period: {{the film version}} of the ITV situation comedy series <b>On</b> the <b>Buses</b> (1971).

5|$|Two {{months after}} the Anacostia Station opened, WMATA said that a study of bus and rail {{ridership}} showed that the unaltered bus routes were costing the transit agency $200,000 a month in lost rail fares. To make up the lost revenue, WMATA {{said that it would}} run only two-car trains (the shortest on the system) on the Green Line during slow periods weekdays and evenings and on Sundays beginning in June 1992. In November 1992, WMATA reported that ridership at the Anacostia Station was (on average) 7,500 riders a day, 700 below estimates. WMATA admitted that although riders had made the switch from bus to rail, the lower ridership numbers were due to the recession and not because of continuing downtown bus service in the area. Metro said ridership <b>on</b> <b>buses</b> in the neighborhood was down significantly, and the transit agency reduced the number of buses on some routes to avoid having empty buses.|$|E

5000|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of <b>On</b> the <b>Buses</b> with sections of the public, TV reviewers and historians have generally held the show in lower regard. In its section on situation comedies, The Guinness Book of Classic British TV describes <b>On</b> the <b>Buses</b> as ITV's [...] "longest running and most self-consciously unfunny series". TV reviewer Victor Lewis-Smith later criticised the then head of London Weekend Television, Frank Muir, for green-lighting the programme, which Lewis-Smith called [...] "the wretched On the Buses". Daily Telegraph journalist Max Davidson, discussing 1970s British comedy, listed <b>On</b> the <b>Buses</b> {{as one of the}} [...] "unfunny sitcoms of the time", while The Guardian's David Stubbs referred to <b>On</b> the <b>Buses</b> as [...] "a byword for 70s sitcom mediocrity".|$|R
