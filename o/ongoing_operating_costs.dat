In May 2013, the Appropriations Committee postponed debate until January 2014. Assemblymember Ammiano {{said in a}} statement that his bill was suspended largely because of the costs of setting up new infrastructure and enforcing the new rules. A report by the Chair of the Assembly Appropriations Committee estimates that setting up hygiene centers across the state would cost $216 million, with <b>ongoing</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> of $81 million annually. The report also estimates that setting up facilities for annual law enforcement reports would cost $8.2 million, with <b>ongoing</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> of $4.1 million annually. Without providing estimates, the report notes that other costs, some potentially significant, include those associated with the right to counsel conferred to the homeless for defending against infractions, and those associated with defending against lawsuits brought against cities by the homeless alleging violations of rights conveyed under the bill.|$|E

Transit advocates often interpret transit subsidization as parallel to road building, which is typically totally subsidized, although <b>ongoing</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> may be lower.|$|E
50|$|The city of Anaheim is {{responsible}} for the <b>ongoing</b> <b>operating</b> and maintenance <b>costs</b> and planned for the facility to be self-funded. Potential revenue sources anticipated in the planning were advertising, a naming-rights sponsor, and leases from tenant business. During the first years, most of the funding has come from the 2 percent assessment from the resort area hotel guests collected by the Anaheim Tourism Improvement District. Some additional funds have come from Measure M2 which is a half-cent countywide sales tax that helps pay for transportation improvements. The city eventually began to obtain lease revenue from commercial tenants but has continued to manage costs at the depot and seek more revenue through events and filming.|$|R
40|$|A special toll is levied on {{users of}} the Arlberg tunnel, the Brenner motorway, the pass section of the Tauern motorway, and the Karawanken, Bosruck and Gleinalm tunnels. Construction of these {{segments}} was financed external (bonds, other loans), {{in order to meet}} traffic requirements earlier than would have been possible through financing from the national budget. Toll receipts were to cover <b>ongoing</b> <b>operating</b> and maintenance <b>costs,</b> the cost of financing and, ultimately, debt redemption. Yet, if we add internal resources contributed by the federal and state governments to the borrowed funds, no special toll section (with the sole exception of the Brenner motorway) has so far been able to produce an ongoing surplus and contribute towards debt redemption. If accounted for in this manner, the special road construction companies had accumulated debts of a total of € 4. 7 billion in 2002, compared to € 7. 5 billion in total debt for Asfinag in general as of the end of 2002.

The Croydon line was intended for Cloncurry until it was diverted in 1890, and Cloncurry waited 20 years for a railway. Today the Mount Isa line continues to serve this major mining centre. Another line that suffered from the lack of geological knowledge of the era was the branch to Mount Morgan, built including Queensland’s only rack railway in order to minimise cost as insurance in case the mine had a short life. The mine in fact {{turned out to be one}} of the richest in Australia, and lasted nearly a century.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of the private provision of a public good that requires both capacity buildup and <b>ongoing</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs.</b> We show that setting a time limit for the collection of contributions dedicated to capacity buildup minimizes the utility loss at the Nash equilibrium. We test the theoretical model empirically by conducting contribution game experiments with religious Jewish students for the procurement of sustainable supplies for their campus synagogues and ongoing operations. The empirical findings support the model's prediction and demonstrate that the theory fairly describes the pattern of contributions when the group of contributors attributes high intrinsic value to the public good. More specifically, we find that total contributions increase over time, contributions to the capacity buildup increase with the time limit and with the number of contributors, and contributions to the capacity buildup decrease with <b>ongoing</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs.</b> Additionally, we determine that gender and culture affect the pattern of contributions. We also find that individuals prefer to contribute to sustainable supplies, rather than to their ongoing operations.

40|$|Data centres form a {{key part}} of the {{infrastructure}} upon which a variety of information technology services are built. They provide the capabilities of centralized repository for storage, management, dissemination and networking of data and information organized around a particular body of knowledge or pertaining to a particular business. The increasing demand for data storage and compute resources has driven the growth of large data centres: the massive server farms that run many of our present day internet and e-commerce applications with its attendant significant investment capital outlay and <b>ongoing</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs.</b> This makes a critical examination of costs associated with building, operating and upgrading data centres imperative. For this cost model to meet the requirements of stakeholders it must capture the multidimensional complexities in power delivery, cooling, and required levels of redundancies for a specific service level agreement. However, non factoring of major total cost of ownership (TCO) parameters like amortization and maintenance costs for power, cooling and information technology resources in the cost model for data centres have questioned the reliability of this cost model, hence necessitate a research of this nature. To attack the problems identified above, I adopted a more accurate data centre construction cost model developed at HP Labs and adopted by the Uptime Institute Inc., to serve as a business intelligence tool for measurement and prediction of TCO and return-on-investment analysis...|$|E

Published small studies evaluating costs have shown savings in terms of <b>ongoing</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> with this modality. However, all estimates need to include the total costs, including infrastructure, patient training, and maintenance; patient attrition by death, transplantation, technique failure; {{and the necessity of}} in-center dialysis. We describe a comprehensive funding model for a large centrally administered but locally delivered home hemodialysis program in British Columbia, Canada that covered 122 patients, of which 113 were still in the program at study end. The majority of patients performed home nocturnal hemodialysis in this 2 -year retrospective study. All training periods, both in-center and in-home dialysis, medications, hospitalizations, and deaths were captured using our provincial renal database and vital statistics. Comparative data from the provincial database and pricing models were used for costing purposes. The total comprehensive costs per patient—incorporating startup, home, and in-center dialysis; medications; home remodeling; and consumables—was $ 59, 179 for years 2004 – 2005 and $ 48, 648 for 2005 – 2006. The home dialysis patients required multiple in-center dialysis runs, significantly contributing to the overall costs. Our study describes a valid, comprehensive funding model delineating reliable cost estimates of starting and maintaining a large home-based hemodialysis program. Consideration of hidden costs is important for administrators and planners to take into account when designing budgets for home hemodialysis...|$|E
40|$|Constable Hansen Kalran of the Vanuatu Police Maritime Wing {{has just}} logged {{on to the}} Internet and has {{downloaded}} a report that gives her cause for concern. Her monitor shows a satellite map of the entire exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Vanuatu and the coordinates of all fishing vessels currently navigating its waters. All of the ships are following routes stipulated in their fishing agreements with the island state, save one: a foreign tuna fishing vessel that should be on its way home. Instead of directly leaving the EEZ from the port where it cleared customs, the vessel has stopped off en route, in all probability to catch extra fish illegally. Kalran wastes no time - she alerts her colleagues {{and within a few}} minutes the Police Maritime Wing´s patrol boat is preparing to intercept and inspect the suspect ship. Dealing with incidents such as {{this is part of the}} daily routine of the Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) Division of the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA). The division has been successfully operating a satellite-based vessel monitoring system (VMS) for its member states in the western and central Pacific since 1999. The VMS is primarily used to ensure that foreign fishing vessels comply with regulations designed to promote the sustainable management and development of and thus to protect the livelihoods of local small-scale tuna fishermen. Enforcing compliance has become increasingly difficult, however. The Pacific tuna fisheries - which support an industry worth $ 1. 8 billion per year - currently account for one-third of global tuna catches, and everyone wants a piece of the pie. To complicate matters, artisanal, subsistence and commercial tuna fishers are searching for four principal species - skipjack, bigeye, yellowfin and albacore - as they migrate through the numerous national jurisdictions and areas of high seas. Approximately 50 - 60 % of the total catch is taken within the EEZs of FFA members, which cover about 30 million km? of ocean. To stem the increase in illegal fishing vessels in this vast area, most FFA members have reserved their 12 nautical-mile exclusion zones for fishing by artisanal and subsistence fishermen, while other islands have put in place 40 nautical-mile exclusion zones that are off-limits to all foreign fishing vessels. Intruders, however, are always on the alert for good fishing opportunities and, increasingly, can only be controlled with the help of advanced ICT systems such as the FFA VMS. How the FFA VMS works The FFA VMS uses satellite technology to pinpoint a vessel´s position and then relays that information to an FFA member monitoring station. At the core of the system is an automatic location communicator (ALC), a sophisticated transponder that every fishing vessel operating in FFA territory is required to have onboard. This device, about the size of a car radio, consists of an integrated global positioning system unit and an Inmarsat transceiver, and monitors the vessel´s position, speed and course. The information is beamed up from an inbuilt aerial to an Inmarsat satellite, which is fixed in geostationary orbit above the Pacific. The satellite transmits the data to a Land Earth Station in Australia, from where it is carried by telephone lines to the VMS hub computer at the FFA Secretariat in Honiara, in the Solomon Islands, for further processing. This computer identifies any vessels violating fishing regulations and generates alert reports. The reports are downloaded via an encrypted Internet connection by the FFA members in whose EEZ the vessels are operating. In January 2004, for example, FFA members were able to use the system to track the activities of 883 foreign fishing vessels. The FFA VMS has already proven to be a cost-effective means of providing support to the region´s compliance and monitoring programme. According to recent statistics, reported cases of illegal fishing have remained at a consistently low level since its introduction in 1999. Its annual <b>ongoing</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs,</b> estimated at $ 845 per vessel, are recovered from the participating tuna fishing vessels. The system also shows strong future potential - it could, for example, easily be applied to track other vessels, such as those that illegally transport live coral reef fish. The FFA VMS is thus paving the way in the development of a fully integrated fisheries management approach for the region. mailto:andrew. richards@ffa. int Andrew Richards is FFA´s Monitoring, Control & Surveillance manager.
