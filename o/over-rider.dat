25|$|For 1966, the GT 350 {{lost its}} Mustang tag and was marketed {{simply as the}} Shelby GT 350. The new model year also saw the {{introduction}} of non-white colors, including blue, red, green, and black. Other changes included special rear quarter-panel windows replacing the factory extractor vents, functional brake scoops on each side, and optional SelectShift 3-speed automatic, {{as well as an}} optional Paxton supercharger. The battery was no longer relocated to the trunk for 1966, and the <b>over-rider</b> traction bars were discontinued. The normal factory fold-down rear seat was optional. While early 1965 cars had black engine blocks, 1966 and later cars had their engines painted the regular factory Ford dark blue. The 1966 models came with a dual-exhaust exiting in the rear.|$|E
2500|$|Many ERT 1965 {{cars had}} the battery {{relocated}} to the trunk, which was changed mid-year from complaints of fumes, and featured <b>over-rider</b> traction bars, relocated A-arms, {{as well as}} other modifications. <b>Over-rider</b> traction bars are named so because of their design being on top of the leaf spring as opposed to underneath them. There was only one transmission available, a 4-speed Borg-Warner T-10 manual. The exhaust system in the 1965 G.T. 350 was a side-exit dual exhaust with glass-pack mufflers. For this one year, the G.T. 350 also featured special 130mph-rated Goodyear [...] "Blue Dot" [...] tires, named for the prominent blue dot on each sidewall. The 1965 G.T. 350 had a full size spare tire mounted in place of rear seats, making it a 2-seat-only vehicle (to be allowed to race under SCCA regulations as a [...] "sports car"), and rode on either silver-painted steel wheels or special cast-magnesium center [...] "Cragar Shelby" [...] 15" [...] rims with chromed center caps marked with a stylized [...] "CS". Total 1965 model year production was 562 units.|$|E

25|$|The American market Spitfire 1500 {{is easily}} {{identified}} by the big plastic <b>over-riders</b> and wing mounted reflectors {{on the front and}} back wings. The US specification models up to 1978 still had chrome bumpers, but on the 1979 and 1980 models these were replaced by black rubber bumpers with built-in <b>over-riders.</b> Chassis extensions were also fitted under the boot to support the bumpers.|$|R

40|$|The role {{concept has}} {{attracted}} {{a lot of attention}} as a construct for facilitating and analysing interactions in the context of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). So far much of this research has been carried out in isolation and the focus on roles lacks cohesion. In this article we present a conceptual framework to synthesise the contemporary conceptualisation of roles, by discerning three levels of the role concept: micro (role as task), meso (role as pattern) and macro (role as stance). As a first step to further conceptualise ‘role as a stance’, we present a framework of eight participative stances defined along three dimensions: group size, orientation and effort. The participative stances – Captain, <b>Over-rider,</b> Free-rider, Ghost, Pillar, Generator, Hanger-on and Lurker – were scrutinised on two data sets using qualitative analysis. The stances aim to facilitate meaningful description of student behaviour, stimulate both teacher and student awareness of roles at the macro-level in terms of participative stances, and evaluate or possibly change the participation to collaborative learning on all levels. ...|$|E

50|$|Both {{standard}} and de-luxe versions were offered. The de-luxe package included a heater, manual screen washer, twin sun visors, twin horns, bumper <b>over-riders,</b> a clock and leather-covered seat. A two-tone paint scheme and a radio were available as options.|$|R
5000|$|In 1955 Peugeot added {{a second}} model to their {{passenger}} car range, and the van acquired the 1,468 cc {{engine of the}} newly launched Peugeot 403 which even in the detuned state used for the commercial vehicle application provided 45 hp of power. Thus enhanced, in August 1955 the Peugeot D3 {{was replaced by the}} Peugeot D4. The new van was virtually indistinguishable from the old one from the outside, unless the customer had paid extra for the side-door which could now be specified for the load area. Also new on the D4 were two “baguette-style” <b>over-riders</b> on the front bumper [...] which enabled keen eyed observers to differentiate the two versions (until 1960, when the <b>over-riders</b> disappeared).|$|R
50|$|Velox LIP {{production}} {{also took}} place in Switzerland, where a 400kg van version (built by Geser of Lucerne) was a common sight in the 1950s serving as Swiss Post Office vehicles. Despite the lack of bumper <b>over-riders</b> suggesting the four-cylinder Wyvern powerplant, all vans were Veloxes. Conventional Velox and Wyvern four-door saloons were assembled at the General Motors plant at Biel.|$|R

25|$|In April 1975, the North American Series II got a {{slightly}} revised set of front bumpers which had rubber <b>over-riders</b> covering {{the full length}} of the bumper with embedded turn signals at each end. In 1975 V12 XJS / XJ12L cars and in 1978 the 4.2 6 cyl. XJ6L North American cars got the addition of Bosch-Lucas electronic fuel injection in the place of Zenith-Stromberg carburettors.|$|R
50|$|The basic car {{was known}} simply as the Opel Kadett or the “standard” Opel Kadett, but for a few hundred Marks more {{customers}} could choose an Opel Kadett “L” with a less Spartan interior {{and a little more}} chrome on the outside, along with <b>over-riders</b> on the bumpers. When the fastback saloon was offered, between 1967 and 1970, it was identified as the Kadett “LS”.|$|R

5000|$|To meet impact regulations, 1974 US models had {{the chrome}} bumper <b>over-riders</b> {{replaced}} with oversized rubber ones, nicknamed [...] "Sabrinas" [...] after the British actress. In {{the second half}} of 1974 the chrome bumpers were replaced altogether. A new, steel-reinforced black rubber bumper at the front incorporated the grille area as well, giving a major restyling to the B's nose, and a matching rear bumper completed the change.|$|R
5000|$|Further changes {{included}} the updating to electric windshield wipers (the previous model FB used vacuum wipers). The other changes were more cosmetic. Holden implemented stronger seat material [...] "ElastoFab" [...] {{due to the}} FB trim splitting at the seams quite easily, with the horizontal mid seat seam trim join. Holden also added a new grille, plenum chamber (Wiper Vent) cover, larger bumper bar <b>over-riders,</b> wider rear-view mirror, different badging and side trim style.|$|R
50|$|All models {{had gained}} air outlets {{added to the}} C-pillar for better ventilation, and a split brake circuit; while some {{features}} previously exclusive to the 124 Special such as servo-assisted brakes, back-up light and an alternator were made standard across the range. Berlina and Familiare both had a new grille with alternated chrome and black horizontal bars, and larger bumper <b>over-riders.</b> Additionally the Berlina had large, nearly square tail lamps made up by two stacked rectangular elements.The renewed Special sported a completely a redesigned front end. A black, square-mesh radiator grille was crossed by an horizontal bright bar joining the dual headlamps; {{each of the four}} round lamps was set in its own square, bright-edged housing. The grille-headlamps assembly was flanked by the turn indicators. Front and rear the bumpers had lost their <b>over-riders,</b> replaced by full-width rubber strips. At the rear the lamps were also new—still horizontal and rectangular in shape unlike the ones used on the standard saloon—and the whole tail panel was surrounded by a chromed profile.Inside there was a new dashboard with imitation wood inserts, carpets instead of rubber mats, and cloth upholstery.|$|R
5000|$|A lightly revised A111 was {{introduced}} at the 52nd Turin Motor Show in October/November 1970. A distinguishing feature of these [...] "series 2" [...] cars were double-stacked tail lamps, {{of the same}} design seen on the original A111. New bumpers gained rubbing strips but dispensed with the <b>over-riders</b> (bringing overall length to less than four metres), there was new model badging on the tail, and the interior was partly redesigned, including a new centre console and a shorter gear shifter.|$|R
50|$|Visually the Special {{could be}} {{immediately}} {{distinguished from the}} standard model by its new, rectangular grille with four inset round headlamps. Less evident differences were larger vertical bumper <b>over-riders,</b> wheels with round ventilation holes as on the Sport models, new flush door handles, different tail lamps with integrated reflectors, and a central back-up light. The interior featured a redesigned padded dashboard with an oval binnacle housing two round instruments and a car radio console, a steering wheel without horn ring, new door cards, and more supportive seats.|$|R
5000|$|Sport 1600 (Tipo 818.750/751): 1971-72. Top of the rang Sport, with 1,584 cc engine {{from the}} HF, {{producing}} [...] With {{a top speed}} of 118 mi/h km/h, this version was the fastest production Fulvia ever produced. The 1600 was distinguished by a matte black radiator grille with chrome edges, black rubber <b>over-riders</b> on the bumpers, a matte black band on the engine bonnet, and new flush door handles. Some of these new fixtures—like the black grille and door handles—found their way on late 1.3 S examples.|$|R
50|$|At the 1957 Turin Motor Show, {{alongside}} the Granluce saloon, Fiat also introduced the 1200 TV Trasformabile two-seater roadster. It was an updated Fiat 1100 TV Trasformabile using the 1200 engine, {{and it was}} called the 1200 Spider in export markets. Exterior changes from the earlier model were minimal, and included new front and rear bumpers with taller <b>over-riders</b> moved further inboards. Inside there was a strip speedometer, and the salooon's steering wheel replaced the wood-rimmed, aluminium-spoked one of the Trasformabile. A novelty feature were swiveling seats, which rotated outwards to facilitate ingress and egress.|$|R
5000|$|Produced from October 1967 to 1969, the V8-250 {{was a minor}} face-lift and re-labelling of the 2.5 V8 saloon and {{differed}} in relatively small details: [...] "slimline" [...] bumpers and <b>over-riders</b> (shared with the Jaguar 240/340 relabelled at the same time), negative-earth electrical system, an alternator instead of a dynamo and twin air cleaners, one for each carburettor. Other new features included padding over the instrument panel, padded door cappings and ventilated leather upholstery, reclinable split-bench front seats and a heated rear window. Power steering and overdrive were optional extras.|$|R
50|$|The new chassis {{consisted}} of a platform braced with box members bounded by reversed U channelling {{the full length of}} each side. The body was then bolted, not welded, alternately to {{the top and bottom of}} that channelling. The forward end was strengthened by diagonal bracing and the centre given extra strength by the tunnel over the transmission. Windows were of toughened glass. The cylinder head was now aluminium for high compression and output now 32 bhp at 4,000 rpm. Shock absorbers were now hydraulic and of the double acting piston type. Bumpers were now given <b>over-riders,</b> lighting was 12-volt.|$|R
50|$|Cars for the US market were {{fitted with}} large {{projecting}} rubber bumper <b>over-riders</b> (in 1973 these were on front, in 1974 both front and rear) to meet local 5 mph impact regulations, but those on European models were considerably smaller. US models also have side indicator repeats {{on the front}} wings. There were also a very limited number of six-cylinder Series 3 E-Types built. These were featured in the initial sales procedure {{but the lack of}} demand stopped their production. When leaving the factory the V12 Open Two Seater and V12 2 ± 2 originally fitted Dunlop E70VR − 15 inch tyres on 15 × 6K wire or solid wheels.|$|R
5000|$|The {{harbinger of}} all Zagato Appias was the {{prototype}} {{built on a}} type 812.01 chassis, serial number 1005, and first displayed at the 1956 Turin Motor Show. It was immediately nicknamed Appia Cammello, [...] "Camel", because of the double humps it carried {{not only on the}} roof—Zagato's signature double bubble—but also on the engine bonnet and boot lid.Originally painted in two-tone blue and white, and fully finished with bumpers and <b>over-riders,</b> this prototype was victorious at that year's Cortina concours d'elegance. Later it was outfitted for racing—applying an amaranto (dark red) livery, removing the bumpers and fitting more conventional looking bonnet and boot lid—and entered at the 1957 Mille Miglia.|$|R
5000|$|The 1956 model, {{introduced}} {{towards the}} end of 1955, featured simplified bumpers from which the <b>over-riders</b> had disappeared. The hitherto [...] "open-mouthed" [...] grill was now filled with closely packed thin vertical bars. Further price reductions followed the trend also followed by other German auto-makers during the mid-1950s and the advertised German market price for the 1956 model ranged from 5,410 to 6,560 marks. The old 1,488 cc engine was also upgraded with a further increase in the compression ratio, now to 6.9:1, and advertised maximum power was increased to 45 hp (33 kW). In other respects the old engine was very little changed.|$|R
5000|$|Revisions for the 1984 {{model year}} {{included}} the Pampa receiving the CHT engine {{which was more}} powerful and economical. The 1,600 cc CHT engine developed [...] in alcohol form and the petrol version [...] giving the Pampas a maximum speed of 160 or 156 km/h respectively. Also for the 1984 model year, a 4x4 version was launched, which would be only Brazilian pickup derived from a two-wheel drive car to be offered with four-wheel drive. Externally, the 4x4 Pampa had few differences compared with the 4x2 version. 4x4 had squared-off grating in the grille, off road tyres, free wheeling wheel hubs and <b>over-riders</b> on the bumpers.|$|R
5000|$|Output of the 240 {{engine was}} {{increased}} from [...] @ 5,750 r.p.m. to [...] at 5,500 rpm. and torque was increased. It {{now had a}} straight-port type cylinder head and twin HS6 SU carburettors with a new inlet manifold. The automatic transmission was upgraded to a Borg-Warner 35 dual drive range. Power steering by Marles Varamatic was now available on the 340. Servicing intervals were increased from 2000 mi to 3000 mi. There was a slight reshaping of the rear body and slimmer bumpers and <b>over-riders</b> were fitted. For {{the first time the}} 2.4 litre model could exceed 100 mph, resulting in a slight sales resurgence.|$|R
50|$|Models {{assembled}} in Slough had {{to consist of}} 51 per cent UK parts to make them exempt from the import taxes imposed by the UK government to protect British vehicle manufacturers from foreign competition. The Slough-built cars used 12-volt Lucas electrics, headlights, dynamo and starter. The interior had a walnut dash board with Jaeger instruments, Connolly Leather seats and door panels and a wool headlining. The exterior was fitted with United Kingdom bumpers and <b>over-riders</b> and a chrome grille, with the Citroën chevrons mounted behind. Some were fitted with a sunroof. Most of the Slough-built cars were right-hand drive, although {{a small number of}} British specification, left-hand drive cars were also built.|$|R
50|$|Nissan {{gave the}} 280ZX a {{facelift}} in 1982, with revised NACA ducting in the hood, new alloy wheels (fourteen inch six-spoke alloys for non-turbo models, and fifteen inch four-spoke alloys for turbo models), a revised B-pillar garnish, new pin-stripe style tail-lights, and rubber bumper <b>over-riders</b> replaced the earlier model's chrome and rubber items, the bumpers were now also body coloured and wrapped around further. Interior changes were minor but included new seat trim styling. The 1982 model {{also was the}} first to offer the popular voice warning system, which warned the driver when the headlights were left on after the vehicle was turned off, if the parking brake was on while the vehicle was in motion, and many others.|$|R
40|$|Renal dosing {{clinical}} {{decision support}} (CDS) systems have demonstrated clinical effectiveness and potential benefits for patient outcomes. However, the high override rates consistently reported are problematic and undesirable. To understand providers' use patterns of renal dosing CDS, we investigated the override reasons obtained from primary care practices affiliated with two teaching hospitals. We selected a stratified random sample of 300 alerts and reviewed electronic medical records. Appropriateness criteria and an inter-rater reliability process were used. We found that two thirds of alerts were overridden inappropriately, and this proportion was similar for frequent <b>over-riders</b> {{as compared to the}} remainder of physicians. These findings imply that strategies are needed to convince providers to accept more clinically appropriate suggestions, though they need to be broadly targeted...|$|R
50|$|Visually the 1300 was {{distinguished}} {{by a new}} grille design housing single instead of twin head lamps, rectangular side repeaters without ornamentation, and all-metal hubcaps. It also did without bumper <b>over-riders,</b> most pieces of exterior chrome trim, and rear back-up lamps. Inside dashboard and steering wheel came from the TI (though the latter was all-black), there were rubber mats instead of carpets, and several convenience features such as the passenger grab handle and rear ashtrays were omitted.In September 1967 the Giulia 1300 was updated, adopting a black mesh grille with three horizontal chrome bars, the vertical louvres {{at the base of}} the windshield first seen on the Giulia Super, the second series Giulia TI three round instrument dashboard, and the 1300 ti's three-spoke steering wheel.|$|R
