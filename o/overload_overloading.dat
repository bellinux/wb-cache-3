The {{relative}} {{carrying capacity}} of resources methods {{was used to}} calculate the relative carrying capacity of land resources, the relative carrying capacity of economic resources and carrying capacity of integrated resource of Xuchang City during 1978 - 2008.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} studies {{the effects of}} a band <b>overload</b> (multiple <b>overloads)</b> on fatigue crack growth. It has been observed that a tensile <b>overload</b> tends to reduce the rate of a fatigue crack growth. The multiple-overloading, hence, is investigated for its effect on the fatigue crack growth. The specimen material is Aluminum 2024 T 3 and a push-and-pull type servo-hydraulic fatigue testing machine INSTRON 8502 was being used to conduct the experiments. The crack growth was measured manually by the use of 1 mm graduations marked on the specimen itself. The notch was further sharpened with a jeweler’s saw. The specimen was being outsourced from HINDALCO. To study the effect of band <b>overloads</b> (multiple <b>overloads),</b> we applied <b>overload</b> cycles of 100, 10, 5 and 2.

These conditions were created by arterio-venous fistula between the carotid artery and jugular vein, closure of the fistula, and cycles of repeatedly forming and closing fistula, respectively. After <b>overload,</b> hearts dilated and myocytes elongated. Intercalated disks repeatedly broadened and narrowed with a 2 -day cycle, which continued for 8 weeks in many animals. The cycle consisted of shifts between five modes characterized by two interdigitation elongation-and-shortenings as follows: (I) flat with short (∼ 1 / 4 to ∼ 1 / 3 sarcomere long) interdigitations; (II) flat with long (one sarcomere long) interdigitations; (III) grooved with short interdigitations; (IV) grooved with long interdigitations; (V) flat with short interdigitations intermingled by sporadic long interdigitations; and return to (I). After <b>overload</b> removal, hearts contracted and myocytes shortened with similar 2 -day broadening and narrowing cycle of intercalated disks, in which the five modes were reversed. Repeated <b>overload</b> and <b>overload</b> removal resulted in the repetition of myocyte elongation and shortening. We hypothesize that a single elongation-and-shortening event creates or disposes one sarcomere layer, and the two consecutive elongation-and-shortenings occur complementarily to each other so that the disks return to their original state after each cycle. Our hypothesis predicts that intercalated disks weave and unravel one sarcomere per myocyte per day...|$|R

According to previous analytical and simulation studies, performance degradation is relatively slow at moderate <b>overloads.</b> The reason is the high variance of the current flow size distribution. We check here these results on a traffic capture. We note a degradation still slower than predicted by the model. We indeed observe stable throughputs for users and connections. The processor sharing model with persistent flows may explain this good performance. Persistent flows impact continuously the performance but they have no influence on the stability of the system and possible <b>overloads.</b> <b>Overloads</b> are only due to dynamic customers.

This study is performed on 2024 T 351 and 7050 -T 74 aluminum alloys, used in aeronautical structures. The propagation model {{used in this}} study is NASGRO model. In constant amplitude loading (CA), effect of stress ratio has been investigated. Fatigue life and fatigue crack growth rate were affected by this factor. Results showed an increasing in fatigue crack growth rates (FCGRs) with increasing stress ratio.
