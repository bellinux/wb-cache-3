Having dignity is something you work on your whole life, in how you treat people and how you treat yourself. I hope I always strive to have it." [...] She continued, [...] "It's not {{something that you can}} be given <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can just get or that you're born with. It's something that you have to work on." ...|$|E
500|$|Weeks after {{accepting}} the appointment, Emanuel participated {{on a panel}} of corporate chief executive officers sponsored by the Wall Street Journal and said, [...] "You never want a serious crisis to go to waste." [...] The quote {{was taken out of}} context by some commentators as evidence [...] "...that the left supposedly wants to exploit circumstances to ram its agenda through." [...] Emanuel explained later, [...] "...what I said was, never allow a good crisis to go to waste when it's an opportunity to do things that you had never considered, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> didn't think were possible." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to disbanding, Exodus International {{recommended}} to their members that they undertake sexual orientation change efforts, such as conversion therapy. Exodus warned against going to counselors who tell a patient that they [...] "can definitely eliminate all attractions to your same gender, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can definitely acquire heteroerotic attractions." [...] Evergreen International did not advocate any {{particular form of}} therapy, and warns that [...] "therapy will likely not be a cure {{in the sense of}} erasing all homosexual feelings." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "You know, it’s not unreal {{to believe}} that white people—who genetically cannot produce yellow, brown or black—had a Black origin. The {{scholars}} and scientists of this world agree that the origin of man and humankind started in Africa and that the first parent {{of the world was}} Black. The Qur'an says that God created Adam out of black mud and fashioned him into shape. So if white people came from the original people, the Black people, what is the process by which you came to life? That is not a silly question. That is a scientific question with a scientific answer. It doesn't suggest that we are superior <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are inferior. It suggests, however, that your birth or your origin is from the black people of this earth: superiority and inferiority are determined by our righteousness and not by our color." ...|$|E
2500|$|Responses to the {{restriction}} and ban of the Imouto Paradise! 2 manga were generally negative. The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund requested that Dan Kanemitsu, a blogger, and a Japanese-to-English translator {{who has worked}} on translating many anime, weigh in on the situation. Kanemitsu criticized the government, saying, [...] "We should always be careful when start to entrust the government with discriminatory polices, be that against people, sexuality, or mediums of self-expression. How would you like it if someone told you homosexuality could be tolerated in only certain mediums, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> may dance to waltz music but not to polka tunes?" [...] Kanemitsu concluded his interview, saying, [...] "If unchecked, the logic behind how Imouto Paradise 2 was designated harmful to minors can be employed by those in power to enforce their own brand of morality upon the public." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eurogamer's Kristan Reed {{also scored}} it 7 out of 10, finding it less {{innovative}} that Midway claimed; [...] "being mainly a platform game with sub sections to add variety, it {{comes across as}} being more heavily indebted {{to the likes of}} [...] and Ratchet & Clank than being anything revolutionary." [...] He concluded [...] "Havens pretensions {{to be some kind of}} revolutionary product seem sound and exciting on the surface, but scratch that surface for more than an hour or so, and it's apparent that what we're really dealing with is a better than average platformer with cleverly interspersed minigames to present the illusion of expansiveness and freedom [...] That's not to say it's a bad game, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> won't enjoy it. If you're a real died in the wool platform gamer, Haven has plenty to admire, but it just fails to match or better what's gone before." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his text}} Buddho Ajahn Thate {{describes}} {{what it is}} like when the mind has finally rid itself of preoccupation with sensual distractions and is able to focus on the breath, mantra, or a part of the body, in meditation: [...] "When you first enter concentration, this is what it's like: [...] You'll have no idea at all of what concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going to feel like. You are simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object – and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object is what will bring you to a state of concentration. You won't be thinking at all that concentration will be like this or like that, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> want it to be like this or like that. It will simply take its own way, automatically. No one can force it. At that moment you will feel as if you are in another world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and solitude to which nothing else in the world can compare. When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and you will remember it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. You have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't try to remember your past states of concentration, and don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you will just be making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|E
