40|$|As {{accidents}} {{have been}} a common routine on roads these days, it has become necessary to take measures that not only save lives but can help people to prevent accidents. One of the major reasons for accidents is <b>over</b> <b>speed.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>speed</b> is {{a condition in which}} an engine is allowed or forced to turn beyond its design limit. The consequences of running an engine too fast vary by engine type and model and depend upon several factors, chief amongst them the duration of the <b>over</b> <b>speed</b> and by the speed attained. With some engines even a momentary <b>over</b> <b>speed</b> can result in greatly reduced engine life or even catastrophic failure. An intelligent car [1] is developed by using RF module [2] so that the speed of the vehicle could not be exceeded even on accelerating in a particular zone like schools, hospitals, etc...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} accuracy of pain on travelling <b>over</b> <b>speed</b> bumps for {{the diagnosis of}} acute appendicitis. DESIGN: Prospective questionnaire based diagnostic accuracy study. SETTING: Secondary care surgical assessment unit at a district general hospital in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 101 patients aged 17 - 76 years referred to the on-call surgical team for assessment of possible appendicitis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios for pain <b>over</b> <b>speed</b> bumps in diagnosing appendicitis, with histological diagnosis of appendicitis as the reference standard. RESULTS: The analysis included 64 participants who had travelled <b>over</b> <b>speed</b> bumps on their journey to hospital. Of these, 34 had a confirmed histological diagnosis of appendicitis, 33 of whom reported increased pain <b>over</b> <b>speed</b> bumps. The sensitivity was 97 % (95 % confidence interval 85 % to 100 %), and the specificity was 30 % (15 % to 49 %). The positive predictive value was 61 % (47 % to 74 %), and the negative predictive value was 90 % (56 % to 100 %). The likelihood ratios were 1. 4 (1. 1 to 1. 8) for a positive test result and 0. 1 (0. 0 to 0. 7) for a negative result. Speed bumps had a better sensitivity and negative likelihood ratio than did other clinical features assessed, including migration of pain and rebound tenderness. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of pain while travelling <b>over</b> <b>speed</b> bumps was {{associated with an increased}} likelihood of acute appendicitis. As a diagnostic variable, it compared favourably with other features commonly used in clinical assessment. Asking about speed bumps may contribute to clinical assessment and could be useful in telephone assessment of patients...|$|R

The proposed system has a reporting displaying and database systemfor <b>over</b> <b>speed</b> violation management. This designed system has the ability to detect the speed of the vehicle in the roads and the main highways and the places where the drivers can use of more speed while driving. The laser transmitter senses the load entered by the vehicle and then the receiver unit sends to the microcontroller. The receiver unit is used by Light Dependent Resistor LDR. If the speed of vehicle exceeds the permissible speed for the highway this information will sent to PC which starts the camera to capture the vehicle. And all the information of vehicle are sent to database system. Then also shows the speed information on LCD...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In {{the present}} day {{scenario}} traffic rules are frequently violated by the drivers and <b>over</b> <b>speeding</b> occur due to bad driving behavior. So, a driver assistance system is provided to prevent <b>over</b> <b>speeding,</b> violation of road rules and also to display alert messages. The proposed system has an alerting, recording and reporting system for <b>over</b> <b>speed</b> violation management. The Zigbee transmitter sends the speed limit of the particular lane entered by the vehicle and also gives alerts like “road works”, “steep slopes”, “school zone ” {{in the form of}} acoustical messages and also in LCD. The receiver unit placed in the vehicle receives the messages and sends to the microcontroller. When speed of the vehicle nears the speed limit it displays the warning and if exceeds the limit, the microcontroller records the violated speed and time. The LCD displays the lane speed limit and shows the number of times, speed was violated. A GSM module sends message to the nearest traffic personnel immediately after a violation occurs. An authenticated device is also provided, which can be operated only by the traffic police in which he can retrieve the data stored at any time. Increase in the count of violation increases the penalty amount which can be collected in toll gates located nearby...|$|R

50|$|A multi-bladed {{windmill}} is {{a mechanical}} device with a piston pump. Because a piston pump has a fixed stroke, the energy demand {{of this type}} of pump is proportional to pump speed only. On the other hand, the energy supply of a wind rotor is proportional to the cube of wind speed. Because of that, a wind rotor runs at <b>over</b> <b>speed</b> (more speed than needed), yielding a loss of aerodynamic efficiency.|$|R

30|$|Driving <b>over</b> the <b>speed</b> limit {{has been}} {{another reason for}} run-off-road crashes. It {{increases}} the occurrence probability of run-off-road crashes more than all other considered variables. It appears that driving <b>over</b> the <b>speed</b> limit in crowded places heads to collision with another vehicle, though run-off-road crashes happen more often in less crowded areas. It is also worth noting that driving <b>over</b> the <b>speed</b> limit will diminish {{the ability to control}} the vehicle, i.e., with any little interference on the road, the driver runs-off-road. Moreover, increasing the speed allowance to more than 50  miles per hour has a significant positive effect on the occurrence of this type of crash. The results show that increasing the allowed driving speed increases the tendency of driving <b>over</b> the <b>speed</b> limit, which increases the probability of occurrence of this type of crash.|$|R
