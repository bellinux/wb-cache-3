40|$|Pitch-related {{deposition}} {{has been}} a significant issue in paper mills that produce wood-containing paper grades. A component analysis showed that a mill deposit sample was a mixture of wood resin, fiber, metal cations, and <b>other</b> <b>inorganics.</b> <b>Based</b> on the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) method, some critical parameters, including pH, metal cations, and their interactions, on the thermal stability of pitch-related deposits were studied. The valency of metal cations determined the ability of capturing pitch the formation of deposits. Trivalent Al 3 + or Fe 3 + ions had much stronger effects than divalent Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, or Mn 2 +. It was also found that a higher pH and trivalent Al 3 + or Fe 3 + increased the thermal stability of deposits formed in colloidal pitch solutions...|$|R

40|$|The delocalised {{nature of}} π-electrons in {{carbon-based}} compounds {{has opened a}} huge path for new fundamental and technological developments using carbon-based materials of different dimensionality (from clusters, to surfaces, nanotubes and graphene, among others). The success of this field has prompted the proposal that <b>other</b> <b>inorganic</b> structures <b>based</b> on B and N and more recently on Si and Ge could be formed with specific structural, mechanical, and electronic properties. In this paper we provide {{an analysis of the}} similarities of the two fields starting from the analysis of the Si 6 H 6 molecule, the analogue of the benzene molecule but now being nonplanar. Then we move {{to the study of the}} two-dimensional (buckled) analogues of graphene but now formed by Si and Ge. Similarly, we look to nonplanar compounds based on boron and boron-carbon nitrogen composites. In particular, we focus on the mechanical properties of those new materials that exhibit a very high stiffness, resilience, and flexibility. Possible applications in the fields of catalysis, lubrication, electronic, and photonic devices now seem a likely by-product. We also address future directions triggered by the predicted superconducting properties of graphene, among other areas...|$|R

40|$|Mechanistic {{investigation}} of Ullmann-Golberg reactions using soluble and partially soluble bases led to identification of various pathways for catalyst deactivation through (i) product inhibition with amine products, (ii) byproduct inhibition with inorganic halide salts, and (iii) ligand exchange by soluble carboxylate bases. Reactions using a partially soluble <b>inorganic</b> <b>bases</b> showed variable induction periods, {{which is responsible}} for reproducibility issues in these reactons. Surprisingly, more finely milled Cs 2 CO 3 resulted in longer induction period due to higher concentration of deprotonated amine/amide, leading to suppressed catalytic activity.

40|$|AbstractThe mass {{transfer}} of CO 2 into aqueous ammonia {{with a series}} of promoters was studied. Three promoters were chosen to represent three different chemical classes. These classes were alkanolamine, amino acid and <b>inorganic</b> <b>base.</b> Of these classes the alkanolamine showed the greatest enhancement of CO 2 {{mass transfer}}, followed by the amino acid. The <b>inorganic</b> <b>base</b> did not show any enhancement. Two factors were identified that lead to the enhancement of CO 2 mass transfer. The first factor was the alkanolamine and amino acid used have faster reactions with CO 2 than ammonia. The second was the presence of ammonia in a high concentration provides additional sites for proton accepting; allowing more of the added alkanolamine or amino acid to react with CO 2. This theory is supported by C 13 NMR data...|$|R
