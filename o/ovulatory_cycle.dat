25|$|Hypersecretion is {{more common}} than hyposecretion. Hyperprolactinemia is the most {{frequent}} abnormality of the anterior pituitary tumors, termed prolactinomas.

Inappropriate lactation (galactorrhoea) is another important clinical sign of prolactinomas.|$|E
25|$|Females mature at 10–12 years (earlier in captivity), {{and males}} at 11–13 years.

The estrous cycle lasts 30–33 days, with outward ovulation signs subtle compared to those of chimpanzees. The gestation period lasts 8.5 months. Female mountain gorillas first give birth at 10 years of age and have four-year interbirth intervals. Males can be fertile before reaching adulthood. Gorillas mate year round.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} line {{of research}} is that which examines women's mate preferences across the <b>ovulatory</b> <b>cycle.</b> The theoretical underpinning {{of this research is}} that ancestral women would have evolved mechanisms to select mates with certain traits depending on their hormonal status. For example, the theory hypothesizes that, during the ovulatory phase of a woman's cycle (approximately days 10–15 of a woman's cycle), a woman who mated with a male with high genetic quality would have been more likely, on average, to produce and rear a healthy offspring than a woman who mated with a male with low genetic quality. These putative preferences are predicted to be especially apparent for short-term mating domains because a potential male mate would only be offering genes to a potential offspring. This hypothesis allows researchers to examine whether women select mates who have characteristics that indicate high genetic quality during the high fertility phase of their ovulatory cycles. Indeed, studies have shown that women's preferences vary across the <b>ovulatory</b> <b>cycle.</b> In particular, Haselton and Miller (2006) showed that highly fertile women prefer creative but poor men as short-term mates. Creativity may be a proxy for good genes. Research by Gangestad et al. (2004) indicates that highly fertile women prefer men who display social presence and intrasexual competition; these traits may act as cues that would help women predict which men may have, or would be able to acquire, resources.|$|E

Design: Prospective investigation. Setting: Academic research institute. Patient(s) : Adolescents with T 1 D (n ¼ 31) and healthy girls (n ¼ 52). Intervention(s) : Ovulation assessed through the measurement of salivary progesterone (days 13, 18, 23, and 28 of each cycle). Main Outcome Measure(s) : Proportion of <b>ovulatory</b> <b>cycles.</b> Result(s) : Atotal of 168 and 281 menstrual cycles were studied in the T 1 D and control girls, respectively.

PATIENTS: 16 young women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and 15 women with normal cycles in early follicular phase. DESIGN: Administration of 50 microgram GnRH and 200 microgram TRH. The women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea were divided into groups A (n= 8) and B (n= 8). Both groups were given 100 mg/day clomiphene for 5 days/month for 3 months. Women in group A were also given 75 mcg/day thyroid hormone (L-thyroxine) for 3 months.

40|$|What is the {{effectiveness}} of continued treatment with clomiphene citrate (CC) in women with World Health Organization (WHO) type II anovulation who {{have had at least}} six <b>ovulatory</b> <b>cycles</b> with CC but did not conceive? When women continued CC after six treatment cycles, the cumulative incidence rate of the ongoing pregnancy rate was 54 % (95 % CI 37 - 78 %) for cycles 7 - 12. If women with WHO type II anovulation fail to conceive with CC within six <b>ovulatory</b> <b>cycles,</b> guidelines advise switching to gonadotrophins, which have a high risk of multiple gestation and are expensive. It is however not clear what success rate could be achieved by continued treatment with CC. We performed a retrospective cohort study of women with WHO II anovulation who visited the fertility clinics of five hospitals in the Netherlands between 1994 and 2010. We included women treated with CC who had had at least six <b>ovulatory</b> <b>cycles</b> without successful conception (n = 114) after which CC was continued using dosages varying from 50 to 150 mg per day for 5 days. Follow-up was a total of 12 treatment cycles. Primary outcome was the cumulative incidence rate of an ongoing pregnancy at the end of treatment. We recruited 114 women that had ovulated on CC for at least six cycles but had not conceived. Of these 114 women, 35 (31 %) had an ongoing pregnancy resulting in a cumulative incidence rate of an ongoing pregnancy of 54 % after 7 - 12 treatment cycles with CC. Limitations of our study are its retrospective approach.

40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} the cumulative number of <b>ovulatory</b> <b>cycles</b> and its contributing components on {{the risk of breast cancer}} among BRCA mutation carriers. Methods: We conducted a matched case–control study on 2, 854 pairs of women with a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutation. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the association between the number of <b>ovulatory</b> <b>cycles</b> and various exposures and the risk of breast cancer. Information from a subset of these women enrolled in a prospective cohort study was used to calculate age-specific breast cancer rates. Results: The annual risk of breast cancer decreased with the number of <b>ovulatory</b> <b>cycles</b> experienced (ρ = − 0. 69; P = 0. 03). Age at menarche and duration of breastfeeding were inversely related with risk of breast cancer among BRCA 1 (Ptrend < 0. 0001) but not among BRCA 2 (Ptrend ≥ 0. 28) mutation carriers. The reduction in breast cancer risk associated with surgical menopause [OR, 0. 52; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 40 – 0. 66; Ptrend < 0. 0001] was greater than that associated with natural menopause (OR, 0. 81; 95 % CI, 0. 62 – 1. 07; Ptrend = 0. 14). There was a highly significant reduction in breast cancer risk among women who had an oophorectomy after natural menopause (OR, 0. 13; 95 % CI, 0. 02 – 0. 54; P = 0. 006). Conclusions: These data challenge the hypothesis that breast cancer risk can be predicted by the lifetime number of <b>ovulatory</b> <b>cycles</b> in women with a BRCA mutation.

50|$|But {{not only}} females' {{preferences}} vary across cycle, their behaviours as well.

Women in the ovulatory phase are flirtier with males showing genetic fitness markers than in low fertile phase.

50|$|With the {{assumption}} that females require {{a certain number of}} copulations before they can conceive, this would suggest that they may achieve this number faster either by having a high number of <b>ovulatory</b> <b>cycles</b> between conceptions, or by appearing more attractive to males around the time of ovulation by having larger swellings. However, more obvious ovulation leads to more male coercion, which may have negative consequences, such as undesired consortship from a low-ranking male, or injury from forcible mating. Therefore, females will only accept this high level of coercion if the scramble competition in their community is high, and if the coercion will allow them to reach their required number of copulations in a short time. For example, eastern chimpanzees who have previously produced offspring tend to experience high within-group scramble, and so are driven towards having fewer <b>ovulatory</b> <b>cycles</b> between conception. As a result, they need to mate with a high number of males during each ovulatory period. They therefore need to appear more attractive during these periods, and so they develop larger sexual swellings.|$|R

40|$|The {{activity}} of the hypothalamic gonadotrophin releasing hormone pulse generator in women with regular ovulatory and anovulatory menstrual cycles was assessed to see whether changes therein are important determinants of normal and impaired ovarian function. Endogenous gonadotrophin releasing hormone secretion was inferred by measurement of the pituitary luteinising hormone response by characterisation of pulsatile luteinising hormone release over eight hours on three occasions {{during the course of}} follicular development and once during the luteal stage of the same <b>cycles.</b> In 13 <b>ovulatory</b> <b>cycles</b> (serum progesterone concentration greater than 25 nmol/l) confirmed by ovarian ultrasonography a pronounced variability in luteinising hormone pulse patterns among subjects was compatible with ovulation. In the luteal stage of <b>ovulatory</b> <b>cycles</b> the luteinising hormone interpeak interval (85 min, range 42 - 125) was significantly longer than that during the early follicular (64 min, 40 - 103), mid-follicular (62 min, 37 - 107), and late follicular (59 min, 39 - 80) stages of the same <b>cycles.</b> Thus in <b>ovulatory</b> <b>cycles</b> no increase in frequency of the gonadotrophin releasing hormone pulse generator was detected during follicular development, though this activity decreased in the luteal stage. In five late follicular stage studies in which part of the preovulatory luteinising hormone surge was captured no change in pulse frequency of luteinising hormone was detected compared with the mid-follicular stage of the same cycles or when compared with the late follicular stage of other cycles when no luteinising hormone surge was captured. Though mean luteinising hormone concentrations in luteinising hormone surge series (36 IU/l) were high, the amplitude of luteinising hormone pulses (165 %) was only slightly greater than during non-surge late follicular stage studies (145 %). Hence no change in hypothalamic gonadotrophin releasing hormone activity is required to generate the preovulatory discharge of luteinising hormone in man, which occurs {{as a result of the}} sensitising action of rising oestradiol concentrations on pituitary responsiveness to the same hypothalamic input signal.
