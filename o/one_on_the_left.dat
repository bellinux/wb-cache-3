The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed {{with black and}} defined with deep shadow. On the fictive architecture each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining {{the shadows of the}} robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.|$|E
5|$|At {{first two}} groups {{established}} themselves on fertile grounds in Silesia: <b>One</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> {{bank of the}} Oder River south of Wrocław, {{in the area that}} included Mount Ślęża, and one around the Głubczyce highlands; both stayed in their respective regions during the 400–120 BC period. Burial and other significant Celtic sites in Głubczyce County were investigated in Kietrz and nearby Nowa Cerekiew. The Ślęża group disintegrated eventually within the local population, while the one at Głubczyce Upland apparently migrated out in the southern direction. More recent discoveries include Celtic settlements in Wrocław County, where in Wojkowice a well-preserved 3rd century BC grave of a woman with bronze and iron bracelets, brooches, rings and chains was found.|$|E

5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic {{muscles of the}} tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem {{as a number of}} small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two {{hypoglossal nerve}}s in the body: <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> and one on the right.|$|E
5|$|The pudendal nerve is paired, meaning {{there are}} two nerves, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> {{and one on the}} right side of the body. Each is formed as three roots {{immediately}} converge above the upper border of the sacrotuberous ligament and the coccygeus muscle. The three roots become two cords when the middle and lower root join to form the lower cord, and these in turn unite to form the pudendal nerve proper just proximal to the sacrospinous ligament. The three roots are derived from the ventral rami of the second, third, and fourth sacral spinal nerves, with the primary contribution coming from the fourth.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August, General Guglielmo Nasi led 35,000 Italian troops, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of them native fighters, across the border into British Somaliland. The invaders were organized into three columns: <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> advancing north to the coast before swinging east to Berbera, one on the right making the opposite motion on the Burao road, and a main central column, led by Carlo de Simone, containing the bulk of his forces. The central column would force the British positions at Tug Argan and make straight for Berbera, effectively ending the campaign in one fell swoop. Nasi advanced quickly upon Hargeisa, forcing harrying British camel soldiers to withdraw by 5 August. After a few days of rest and rearmament, the march was resumed on 8 August. After two days of probing, de Simone reached the Tug Argan gap and prepared for the major assault, scheduled for 11 August. In the meantime, General A. R. Godwin-Austen arrived to take command of the enlarged British army.|$|E

5|$|The {{vertebral}} arteries {{emerge as}} {{branches of the}} left and right subclavian arteries. They travel upward through transverse foramina – spaces in the cervical vertebrae and then emerge as two vessels, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> and one on the right of the medulla. They give off one of the three cerebellar branches. The vertebral arteries join in front of the middle part of the medulla to form the larger basilar artery, which sends multiple branches to supply the medulla and pons, and the two other anterior and superior cerebellar branches. Finally, the basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries. These travel outwards, around the superior cerebellar peduncles, and {{along the top of the}} cerebellar tentorium, where it sends branches to supply the temporal and occipital lobes. Each posterior cerebral artery sends a small posterior communicating artery to join with the internal carotid arteries.|$|E

25|$|The French {{initially}} occupied {{both sides}} of the Chao Phraya in Bangkok, with two fortresses, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> bank (the Bangkok fortress) and one on the right bank (the Thonburi fortress). Seeing that the position would be difficult to defend, especially since communications would become nearly impossible at low tide, the French decided to regroup in the larger fortress, on the left bank of the river. The French destroyed parts of the fortifications, split 18 cannons and spiked the rest. Soon after they left the smaller fort, Siamese troops invested it and began to set up cannons and mortars to bombard the French positions. Forty cannons were set up there, which were in a very good position to shoot at the French fortress {{on the other side of}} the river.|$|E
25|$|Cheek kissing in the Arab {{world is}} {{relatively}} common, between friends and relatives. Cheek kissing between males is very common. However, cheek kissing between {{a male and}} female is usually considered inappropriate, unless within the same family; e.g. brother and sister, or if they are a married couple. Some exceptions to this are liberal areas within cities {{in some of the}} more liberal Arab countries such as Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Tunisia, where cheek kissing is a common greeting between unrelated males and females in most communities. The Lebanese custom has become the norm for non-Lebanese in Lebanese-dominated communities of the Arab diaspora. Normally in Lebanon, the typical number of kisses is three: <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> cheek, then right, and then left between relatives. In other countries, it is typically two kisses with one on each cheek.|$|E
25|$|In 1516, Manuel {{ordered the}} {{publication}} of a compromise with the Santa Irmandade da Misericórdia for the building of the church. At the time, the building was carved into stone with vaulted-ceiling decorated with regal and sacred emblems, it was supported by marble pillars, dividing the structure into three naves. The presbytery, located in the east, along the line with main portico, (from plans and sketchs dating from the 1755 earthquake). In the south was a door, flanked by sculpted pillasters and three windows (<b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> and the other on the right), the cornice was surmounted by larger lentel, and on either side was a tower (the western side called Escrivaninha), all of which was detailed in the gravura de Leyden (Leyden etchings).
