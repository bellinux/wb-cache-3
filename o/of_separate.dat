40|$|Background/purpose: There are {{controversial}} {{opinions about}} the prognosis of the retrieval <b>of</b> a <b>separated</b> instrument from the root canal. The aim {{of the study was}} to establish a statistical model to predict the success rate of the retrieval <b>of</b> <b>separated</b> instruments and to aid clinicians with decision-making. Materials and methods: In retrospective studies, information on the tooth position, the root canal curvature, and the depth and length <b>of</b> <b>separated</b> instruments were collected in 210 clinical cases with separated instruments in the lower segments of curved root canals. The correlations of these factors and the retrieval rate <b>of</b> <b>separated</b> instruments were analyzed. Two factors with significant correlations were chosen and a regression equation was established using stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis. In the verification study, the efficiency of the statistical model was verified by 63 new cases. Results: The root canal curvature and depth <b>of</b> the <b>separated</b> instruments are major factors affecting the retrieval rate of broken instruments. The retrieval rate <b>of</b> <b>separated</b> instruments decreased gradually with the increase of root canal curvature or the depth of the instrument. A regression equation was established correlating these two factors. The predicted accuracy rate of the regression equation was 94. 3 % for successful retrieval, and 80. 0 % for failed retrieval. Conclusion: A statistical model relating to root canal curvature and depth <b>of</b> <b>separated</b> instruments was established to evaluate the retrieval rate <b>of</b> <b>separated</b> instruments, and the result of this formulation may provide clues for clinical decision-making...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} Monte Carlo {{calculations}} were performed {{in order to}} evaluate the effect <b>of</b> <b>separated</b> against merged spin statistics on the analysis of spherical shell neutron transmission experiments for gold. It is shown that the use <b>of</b> <b>separated</b> spin statistics results in larger average capture cross sections of gold at 24 KeV. This effect is explained by stronger windows in the total cross section caused by the interference between potential and J(+) resonances and by J(+) and J(-) resonance overlap allowed by the use <b>of</b> <b>separated</b> spin statistics...|$|R

5|$|As {{with many}} dinosaur families, the {{systematics}} (evolutionary relationships) {{within the family}} Abelisauridae are confused. Several cladistic {{studies have indicated that}} Majungasaurus shares a close relationship with Carnotaurus from South America, while others were unable to firmly place it in the phylogeny. The most recent analysis, using the most complete information, instead recovered Majungasaurus in a clade with Rajasaurus and Indosaurus from India, but excluding South American genera like Carnotaurus, Ilokelesia, Ekrixinatosaurus, Aucasaurus and Abelisaurus, as well as Rugops from mainland Africa. This leaves open the possibility <b>of</b> <b>separate</b> clades of abelisaurids in western and eastern Gondwana.|$|E
