Oregon notaries are empowered to administer oaths, jurats and affirmations (including oaths of office), to take affidavits and depositions, to receive and certify acknowledgments or proof of deeds, mortgages and powers of attorney and other instruments in writing; to demand acceptance or payment of foreign and inland bills of exchange, promissory notes and obligations in writing, and to protest these (that is, certify them) for non-acceptance or non-payment. They are also empowered to certify [...] "true copies" [...] of most documents. Every court clerk in Oregon is also empowered {{to act as a}} notary public, although they are not required to keep a journal. Oregon formerly required that impression seals be used, but now it is optional. The ink seal must be in black ink. [...] Beginning in 2001, all Oregon notaries were required to pass an <b>open-book</b> <b>examination</b> to receive their commission. Beginning in 2006, new notary applicants were also required to complete a free three-hour online or live in-person instructional seminar, however this requirement is waived for notaries who are renewing their commissions, as long as the commission is renewed before its expiration date. [...] Oregon law specifically prohibits {{the use of the term}} [...] "notorio publico" [...] by a notary in advertising his or her services, but translation of the title into other languages is not restricted.|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} an overview of the perceptions of alumni in relation to their experience of <b>open-book</b> <b>examinations</b> (OBEs) as post-graduate students. This type of assessment was introduced as a way of allowing these adult learners to demonstrate their conceptual understanding and ability to apply knowledge in practice, which in theory would equip them with problem-solving skills required for the workplace. This study demonstrates that alumni-shown to be predominantly deep learners-typically regarded OBEs as less stressful than closed-book examinations, and as an effective way to assess the application of knowledge to real-life problems. Additional staff training and student induction, particularly for international students, are suggested as a means of improving the acceptability and effectiveness of OBEs...|$|R
40|$|Many Australian {{university}} assessment policies stipulate against {{having an}} examination {{as the sole}} assessment task in a unit, and a diverse range of assessment tasks {{have been designed to}} complement examinations. In a legal education context, an end-of-semester, <b>open-book,</b> problem-based <b>examination</b> incorporates some features of ‘authentic assessment’, but overall has a low level of authenticity. For the purposes of this article, ‘authentic assessment’ means a form of assessment that reflects the role of a lawyer in the real world. Strategies for improving the authenticity of an end-of-semester, <b>open-book,</b> problem-based <b>examination</b> are identified. The assessment tasks implemented in the twenty-first century in the Criminal Law subject at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) are used as a case study. The level of authenticity of these assessment tasks is measured, and recommendations are provided for enhancing their authenticity...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of whether <b>open-book</b> <b>examinations</b> (OBE) are preferable to closed book examinations (CBE) {{is not a new}} one. However, little has been written on the {{question of}} the use of OBE in the discipline of law or as a means of promoting more effective teaching and learning. This article will examine the arguments for and against the utilisation of OBE as opposed to CBE for students of law at university level. Utilising secondary data, as well as a primary small-scale empirical study the author explores student views of OBE and CBE and their significance for teaching and learning in law. It is suggested that the issue may not be simply a question of choice of assessment methods and their value but rather involves examining and evaluating approaches to teaching, learning and curriculum design. In conclusion it is argued that there are several factors which need to be taken into account when deciding what form of assessment is the most appropriate for these students but that the key requirement is that the course design and teaching, learning and assessment methods are aligned and considered as a whole, matching learning outcomes to teaching and learning activities and to the form of assessment chosen. Only within this context can OBE promote more effective learning...|$|R
40|$|A {{first year}} course, Business Statistics, was {{selected}} {{to be the first}} subject to implement the <b>open-book</b> <b>examination</b> in the School of Accountancy and Business, Nanyang Technological University. The objective of the study is to examine students’ perception of the examination. A survey was conducted via a questionnaire after an open-book mid-term examination. The results based on 583 respondents out of 794 students, show that more than 60 % of the students prefer the <b>open-book</b> <b>examination</b> to a closed-book examination. Students ’ preferences are only related to the major field of study. In particular, proportionately more respondents who major in Business as compared to Accountancy prefer open-book examinations. The reasons that statistically significant different are less time-consuming for preparation, less memorization and more room for creative thinking. 2 Open-book Examinatio...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: An open-book exam {{permits the}} examinees to consult some {{specific}} selected reference sources or materials while answering the exam questions. This {{study focused on}} the students' perspectives of open-book examinations in the histology/embryology courses, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences (ZUMS), Zahedan, Iran. Methods: The survey was conducted via a questionnaire after open-book examinations had been conducted in the histology and embryology courses, between 2009 and 2010. Of the 254 students who entered the new education system, 160 students were selected at random. Results: The results revealed that 72 % of the students preferred the open-book type to the closed-book kind of examinations. Most of the students voiced {{that this type of}} examination was more suited to test high cognitive learning skills and solving real life situation problems, involving less stress while preparing for and taking the exam. They also mentioned that their marks in these examinations were not higher than those from the closed-book examinations. The overall satisfaction scores of the students of the biological sciences were significantly (p< 0. 001) higher than those of the medical sciences students (16. 28 ± 4. 17 vs. 12. 65 ± 5. 16); in the government run university students it was significantly (P< 0. 001) higher than in the international university students (14. 93 ± 4. 53 vs. 10. 24 ± 5. 08); the embryology course results were significantly (p< 0. 001) higher than the histology course (15. 23 ± 4. 07 vs. 12. 79 ± 5. 4) and among the MD students it was significantly (p< 0. 001) lower than those of the BSc students (12 ± 5. 1 vs. 15. 93 ± 4. 29). There was a positive correlation between the scores they acquired in their course and the overall satisfaction scores with the open-book type of examinations (r= 0. 46, p value= 0. 01). Conclusions: The finding of a positive response towards the <b>open-book</b> <b>examination</b> augurs well for extending such a type of examination to other subjects in our university.

40|$|Open-book {{examinations}} {{are believed}} to be able to reduce students’ anxiety and rote memorising of facts. However, in cultures where prescriptive teaching dominates, open-book examinations may need to be accompanied with changes in lecturing methodologies and better preparation for individual’s critical thinking. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess what preparations students have undertaken before taking open-book examinations and what learning style they adopted during the preparation of this non-traditional approach to subject testing. The methodology chosen was to interview 10 students who had no <b>open-book</b> <b>examination</b> experience before. They had their first trial a week before the interview. The results indicated that, although students had a positive perception towards open-book examinations, the preparation needed and the processing of information read in order to answer the examination questions were relatively minimal. Students appeared to need more guidance as to how they would be assessed and more trained on critical thinking. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of eight different assessment methods - (1) seminar, (2) closed-book mid semester test, (3) open-book mid-semester test, (4) problem-based assignment, (5) presentation, (6) multiple choice question test, (7) closed-book final <b>examination,</b> and (8) <b>open-book</b> final <b>examination</b> - is studied in this paper. A detailed survey is conducted to thoroughly understand student needs, and {{the significance of}} assessment items and methods.

40|$|Multiple-choice (MC) {{examinations}} {{are becoming}} increasingly popular in higher education {{because they can be}} used effectively to assess breadth of knowledge in large cohorts of students. This present research investigated Psychology students' performance on, and experiences of, MC examinations with and without correction for guessing. In Study 1, data were collected from two cohorts of students across three Psychology MC examinations. The results revealed that students scored higher, and left fewer questions unanswered, when there was no correction for guessing. Furthermore, when the correction for guessing was removed from the theory MC examination, students who were told there was no correction for guessing did better than those told there was a correction. In addition, there was limited evidence of gender differences, with female students performing significantly better on one MC examination than males. In Study 2, a further set of first-year Psychology students reported their experiences of correction for guessing on open-book and closed-book MC examinations. Students reported feeling less anxious and more confident on the <b>open-book</b> MC <b>examination.</b> The findings of both of these studies have implications for instructors deciding whether or not correction for guessing is appropriate, and for the advice to be given to students preparing for MC examinations...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{problems}} of external examining, the inflexible demands of which dominate and dictate to literature teaching in South African schools today. The aims of teaching literature are discussed, and it is suggested that the negative attitudes among pupils resulting from the present examining system defeat many of these aims. The opportunities for the enjoyment of literature are minimised by the process of preparation for external examinations. Creative teaching methods are abandoned in favour of coaching for specific types of questions, which are determined and limited by the practical constraints of a mass external examination. In catering to the demands for admininstrative reliability and efficiency, the educational validity and efficiency of the examinations are sacrificed. In Britain the Newbolt and Bullock Reports, among others, have made forceful recommendations for alternative approaches to external examining. Subsequently, much experimentation with internal examining, course-work and open-book examining has followed, aspects of which are discussed in this study. There has been limited experimentation in these areas in South Africa. The TED conducted a successful internal examining experiment in English literature, the results of which are considered in this thesis. The national English Olympiad <b>open-book</b> <b>examination</b> is a further example of the success of an alternative approach. By contrast, a comparison of examination papers set by the JMB and CED over the last ten years, shows clearly that the stated syllabus aims of teaching literature and the aims of examining the subject were wholly incompatible. Recommendations are made for the adoption of alternative examining strategies in order to address the shortcomings identifie...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This study is concerned with developing an understanding of students' learning as they prepare for the final qualifying examination of a professional accountancy body in Ireland. It explores, {{from the perspectives of}} students, approaches to learning for the examination, the factors which influence those approaches and perceptions of the outcomes of the learning process. The research is conducted within an interpretive framework and it employs both qualitative and quantitative research methods. In-depth interviews examine students' motivations as they prepare for the examination and their intentions to. seek understanding in their learning. The interviews also provide rich descriptions of students' detailed study activities, the key factors which influence their learning and their perceptions of learning outcomes. Quantitative data concerning students' learning approaches as they prepared for the final qualifying examination were gathered using the Approaches and Studies Skills Inventoiyfor Students (ASSIST, 1997), which was conceptually and statistically validated for use in the particular learning context. The findings of this study depict students' learning as they prepare for the final qualifying examination as highly contextualised. Students are intent on achieving examination success, primarily for the purposes of progressing their careers as professional accountants. They perceive the qualifying examination to be a hurdle and they plan and engage in their study in order to overcome it and to access the perceived career benefits that lie beyond. Thus, students' preparation is generally framed by strategic motivation rather than by intrinsic interest in the syllabus material or the accounting discipline. They perceive that the examination requires the understanding of material as opposed to simple regurgitation of facts, so they undertake their study with the intention of seeking understanding. While variation is revealed in the ways in which students operationalise this intention in their detailed study activities, deep/strategic learning approaches were primarily found to dominate surface learning approaches. The study reveals that the key aspects of the professional accounting education environment which influence students' learning are the nature of the final qualifying examination itself (case-based papers, <b>open-book</b> <b>examination</b> environinent) and the context in which they work. It also identifies that students' perceptions of the outcomes of the learning process rest firmly on whether they achieve examination success. There is little evidence that students associate the final qualifying examination with developing professional competence or with fostering the knowledge, skills and values required to support lifelong learning. This study is novel in its combination of the subject matter (students' learning) and the setting (pre-qualification professional accounting education) and it thus contributes to the professional education and accounting education literatures. The findings of the study benefit a range of stakeholders and they particularly contribute to any review of the pre-qualification education system of the particular professional accountancy body...|$|E
