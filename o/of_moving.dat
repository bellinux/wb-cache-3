Since large number of simultaneous replays increases the chance of overlapping textures, we propose the method {{to determine the best}} number of replays.

40|$|Electronic {{states of}} Li ions during the ionic jumps in the Li 3 N crystal was {{discussed}} {{on the basis}} of the first principle molecular orbital calculations. The movements of the Li ions were simulated by several model clusters with different positions <b>of</b> the <b>moving</b> cation. The net charge <b>of</b> the <b>moving</b> Li ion and the total bond overlap population between the moving Li ion and the other ions were used for discussion of chemical bonding <b>of</b> the <b>moving</b> Li ion. Furthermore we have estimated the local cluster energy (LCE) to compare the energy change in the different <b>moving</b> path <b>of</b> the Li ion. The total bond overlap population <b>of</b> the <b>moving</b> Li ion along the conduction path changed smaller than those of the other paths. On the other hand, the changes of the net charges <b>of</b> the <b>moving</b> Li ions were similar in any paths. The change of the LCE in the model cluster of the conduction path was much smaller than that in another model cluster. As the results, the smaller change of the total bond overlap population <b>of</b> the <b>moving</b> Li ions played an important role for the fast ion movement in the Li ion conductors, rather than the change of the net charge <b>of</b> the <b>moving</b> Li ions. This bonding state <b>of</b> the <b>moving</b> Li ions is one of the characteristics of the electronic state in Li ion conductors...|$|R

5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, Eline was still encountering wind shear and dry air. Despite these factors, the eye became better defined and the storm intensified, aided by favoring upper-level conditions. The cyclone turned {{more to the}} west toward Madagascar, despite a weakness in the ridge to the south. While approaching the country, Eline quickly intensified, reaching 10‑minute winds of 165km/h (105mph) by 18:00UTC on February17. Around that time, the cyclone made landfall on eastern Madagascar near Mahanoro. Eline rapidly weakened over land while moving to the west-southwest, and the JTWC downgraded the storm to tropical depression status within 18hours <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> ashore.|$|E
