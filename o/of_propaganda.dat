It also facilitated the Red Sea trade on which it thrived.

These reforms, which include improving performance quality, adapting new performance elements, and performing new and original plays, have met with mixed success.|$|E

5|$|The wartime {{authorities}} in both Britain and America produced {{a wide variety}} of documentary films. Their purposes included military training, advice to civilians, and encouragement to maintain security. Since these films often carried messages, they grade into propaganda. Similarly, commercially produced films often combined information, support for the war effort, and a degree <b>of</b> <b>propaganda.</b> Newsreels, ostensibly simply for information, were made in both Allied and Axis countries, and were often dramatised. More recently, in the Iran-Iraq War, Morteza Avini's Ravayat-e Fath (Chronicles of Victory) television series combined front-line footage with commentary.|$|E

5|$|These troops, {{who were}} trained soldiers, were {{responsible}} for preparing the combat reports {{to be used as}} source material for the OKW communiqués. The propaganda companies were only news-reporting units in areas of military operation, as civilian news correspondents were prohibited from entering combat zones. The troops produced the written, audio and film materials from the front and sent them to a processing center in Germany, where they were reviewed by censors, mostly for security purposes. The filtered materials were then forwarded to the Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Propaganda</b> for immediate dissemination.|$|E
5|$|When Adolf Hitler rose to power, Joseph Goebbels became Minister <b>of</b> <b>Propaganda</b> and {{banned the}} film in Germany, {{suggesting}} that the film would undermine the audience's confidence in its statesmen. The French-language and German-language versions of the film were released in Europe while several versions of the film were released in the United States to mixed reception with each re-release. The sequel The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse (1960) was also directed by Lang. Modern reception {{of the film is}} favorable with critics, while the film has influenced filmmakers including Claude Chabrol and Artur Brauner.|$|E
