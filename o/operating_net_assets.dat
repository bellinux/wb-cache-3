40|$|If {{investors have}} limited attention, then {{accounting}} outcomes that saliently highlight {{positive aspects of}} a firm's performance will promote high market valuations. When cumulative accounting value added (<b>net</b> <b>operating</b> income) over time outstrips cumulative cash value added (free cash flow), it becomes hard for the firm to sustain further earnings growth. When the balance sheet is 'bloated' in this fashion, we argue that investors with limited attention will overvalue the firm, because naïve earnings-based valuation disregards the firm's relative lack of success in generating cash flows in excess of investment needs. The level of <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>assets,</b> the difference between cumulative earnings and cumulative free cash flow over time, is therefore {{a measure of the}} extent to which operating/reporting outcomes provoke excessive investor optimism.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether {{market prices}} fully reflect {{the information contained}} in the level of <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>assets</b> about the long-term sustainability of the firm’s financial performance. In our 1964 - 2002 sample, the ratio of <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>assets</b> to beginning total assets (NOA) is a strong negative predictor {{for at least three years}} of future stock returns. Predictability is robust with respect to the use of a characteristic portfolio benchmark matching procedure, Fama-French 3 and 4 -factor benchmarks, and Fama-MacBeth crosssectional monthly regressions using an extensive set of controls for pricing anomalies in the finance literature (market value, the book-to-market ratio, and one-month, 12 -month, and 3 -year past stock returns). Furthermore, the sustainability effect remains after controlling for current and past period operating accruals and the most recent change in <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>assets,</b> and provides higher and statistically more significant hedge profits than the operating accruals anomaly. Controlling for NOA weakens but does not entirely subsume the operating accruals anomaly.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the {{financial}} performance of retail firms with fiscal years ending on or around December 31, 2008 and 2009 (the recession years) with retail firms with fiscal years ending on or around December 31, 2006 and 2007 (the non-recession years). As with Little, Little, and Coffee (2008), the modified Du Pont model of financial ratio analysis is used to identify the drivers of financial success under alternative business strategies. Firms in the retail industry are categorized according to their high/low relative <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> income to sales and operating asset turnover ratios. Firms with high relative <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> income to sales and low relative operating asset turnover are assumed to be pursuing a differentiation strategy and those with high relative operating asset turnover and low relative <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> income to sales are assumed to be pursuing a cost leadership strategy. The performance variable used is return on <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>assets.</b> One stream of prior research suggests that a firm could, in theory, perform well following either strategy. Little, Little, and Coffee (2008) suggest that retail firms using a differentiator strategy outperform (based on return on <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>assets)</b> those using a cost leader strategy.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} presence of transient institutional investors is associated with increases in firms’ return on <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>assets.</b> Previous research argues that the short-term focus of institutional investors influences the corporate strategy of managers; as a result, institutional investors induce managerial myopia. I test this hypothesis by examining the relationship between transient institutional ownership—ownership by institutions that exhibit “transient” behavior—and return on <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>assets</b> (RNOA). The results are inconclusive, as my regressions generate conflicting results. Therefore, the theory that transient institutional ownership causes myopia can neither be confirmed nor denied. Furthermore, I find that transient institutional ownership has an inverse relationship with asset turnover, which {{in the context of}} DuPont Analysis suggests that transient institutional ownership leads to decreases in RNOA and decreases in myopic behavior. This result contradicts my hypothesis, inferring that institutional ownership reduces managerial myopia...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{accounting}} studies {{claim that}} investors fail to rationally price accrual-related information and that investors are functionally fixated. This study documents {{the importance of}} performing robustness tests when testing economic or behavioral explanations for apparent accounting-related security mispricing. We find that performing robustness tests that exclude {{a small number of}} firm-year observations (approximately 200 firm-year observations or about 1 % of the entire sample) reveals an inverted U-shaped relation between buy-and-hold abnormal returns and total accruals. An inverted U-shaped relation is inconsistent with the functional fixation (earnings fixation) hypothesis. We conduct similar robustness tests for the abnormal accrual anomaly and the <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>assets</b> anomaly proposed by other investigators, and also find an inverted U-shaped relation between buy-and-hold abnormal returns and abnormal accruals and <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>assets.</b> These findings are inconsistent with the explanations put forth by those investigators. Such evidence leads us to conclude that the accrual-related anomalies are unlikely to be due to investors' inability to process accounting information, as suggested by the functional fixation hypotheses tested.

40|$|In this paper, we {{extend the}} work of Hirshleifer, Hou, Teoh and Zhang (2004) on the “sustainability effect” by {{directly}} linking the implications of NOA (<b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>assets)</b> and NOA components for the sustainability of current earnings performance with future stock returns. After controlling for current profitability, we find a strong negative relation of NOA with future stock returns. Moreover, {{the results indicate that}} this relation is associated with the sustainability implications of the underlying components of NOA. We also find that the hedge strategies on NOA and those NOA components that indicate low sustainability of current profitability generate positive abnormal returns and constitute statistical arbitrage opportunities. The findings on the sources of the NOA anomaly indicate a significant role for earnings management but no significant role for growth. However, it is found that the interaction of earnings management and growth is an important contributing factor in the anomaly. Overall, our evidence suggests that the interpretation of the NOA anomaly requires investor's limited attention on accounting distortions arising from earnings management. <b>Net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>assets</b> (NOA), sustainability effect, earnings management, growth. ...|$|R

The introduction section contains, among others, search of knowledge about the human capital valuation including an identification of "empty spaces" in the business valuation theory in connection with the valuation of human assets. The main aim of the dissertation is the theoretical and experimental development of selected "empty spaces" which were divided into two levels - direct (separate) valuation of human assets and indirect (implicite) valuation of human assets through enterprise valuation methods DCF and EVA. The theoretical section includes a treatise on the status of human assets (human capital) within the intellectual capital and the absence of human assets in the financial statements which are coming to the conclusion that human assets should be incorporated as a separate item in <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>assets</b> of the enterprise in DCF and EVA valuation methods. The dissertation analyzes various definitions of human capital and subsequently on the basis of specific design requirements derives definition of human assets for the purposes of business valuation. The experimental section provides descriptions and analyzes of available methods/models for human assets (human capital) valuation. Subsequently, the derived modified income approach valuation for the direct valuation of human assets includes proposals for an allocation of revenues attributable to human assets, an incorporation of the quality element of human assets assessment to a forecast of future revenues which are attributable to human assets and the specific discount rate for human assets. In the framework of indirect valuation of human assets (in DCF and EVA methods), the attention is aimed to a design of variant options of financial value of human assets incorporation into the <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>assets</b> (among others, these part also contains a proposal of a theoretical basis for determining of human assets market value) and adjustments of economic reports: <b>net</b> operatig <b>assets</b> (NOA) and <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> profit after tax (NOPAT).

Furthermore, the thesis compares the <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flows between mutual funds and ETFs by the asset class. Data and methodology The data for the thesis was received from Bloomberg and Lyxor Asser Management, a subsidiary of Société Générale. The data consists <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flows, replication method, asset class and securities lending on 2054 European domiciled ETFs. In addition, the thesis includes data about European domiciled mutual funds. First, the thesis compares <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flows between mutual funds and ETFs by asset class. Secondly, regression model is used to analyze the <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flows to ETFs by asset class. Replication method, securities lending and critical report by the IMF have been treated as dummy variables. Results The results show that the European domiciled equity and commodity ETFs have attracted larger <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flows compared to their mutual fund peers in recent years. However, European domiciled fixed income mutual funds have attracted larger <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flows compared to fixed income ETFs. The results of the regression model show that the physical ETFs have had a <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flow premium compared to their synthetic peers in equities, fixed income and commodities between January 2010 and March 2015. In addition, regression models show that the securities lending generates $ 149. 0 m monthly premium for equity ETFs, whereas the securities lending premium is $ 178. 2 m for fixed income ETFs over ETFs, which do not participate in securities lending. Finally, according to the regression model the critical report by IMF had a positive effect ($ 486. 7 m monthly premium) on the <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flows to physical equity ETFs and negative effect ($ - 845. 4 m monthly premium) on the <b>net</b> <b>asset</b> flows to synthetic equity ETFs...|$|R

Out of the three components, the TA growth anomaly appears to be driven only by the market???s misunderstanding of NOA growth???s negative implications for future profitability. The two additional components fail to predict future abnormal returns and, in fact, substantially dilute the predictability of NOA growth. This study suggests that it is not sufficient to decompose asset growth only by asset types or liability types in order to capture the differential implications of asset growth components. It is important for us to further decompose asset growth by financing sources within a given type of assets.

We also find that the generated abnormal returns from hedge strategies that combine information on retained earnings (and on other accrual proxies) or cash distributions to equity holders and value/glamour proxies are significantly higher than those from each proxy alone. Thus, if one agrees that the notion of statistical arbitrage is incompatible with market efficiency our evidence suggests that the anomalies on accruals and net stock issues capture distinct forms of mispricing with the value glamour anomaly.
