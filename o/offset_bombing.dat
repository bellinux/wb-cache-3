50|$|The {{system also}} added {{the ability to}} perform <b>offset</b> <b>bombing,</b> a {{relatively}} common addition to post-war bombing systems. It was found during operations that the target itself might not appear on the radar. In these cases, the navigator would select a nearby feature that would visible on the radar, a bend in a river or a radio tower for instance, and measure the angle and distance {{between it and the}} target. They would then attempt to guide the aircraft so that the selected aiming feature was in the proper location relative {{to the center of the}} display, by no means a simple task. <b>Offset</b> <b>bombing</b> allowed the navigator to dial these offsets into the display, which caused the entire display to move by that amount. The navigator then guided the aircraft so that the selected feature passed through the center of the display, which was much easier to arrange.|$|E
