At energies lower than the threshold energy, electron fluxes decrease, potentially due to precipitation by strong parallel electrostatic wavefields or initial sources in the lobes. Electrons at energies higher than the threshold are accelerated cumulatively by a series of impulsive magnetic dipolarization events. This case demonstrates how the upper energy cutoff increases, in this case from approx. 130 keV to > 500 keV, with each depolarization/injection during sustained activity.

30|$|Although radar {{observations}} {{are capable of}} investigating the spatial structure of Pi 2 pulsations at mid latitudes (36 °– 60 °), only {{a few studies have}} investigated Pi 2 pulsations by using the SuperDARN radars at mid latitudes (Ponomarenko et al. 2003; Gjerloev et al. 2007; Frissell et al. 2011; Teramoto et al. 2014). To investigate generation mechanisms of Pi 2 pulsations, <b>multipoint</b> <b>observations</b> are needed because Pi 2 pulsations are globally excited in the mid and low latitudes. In particular, a comprehensive survey of Pi 2 pulsations near the plasmapause is important because the plasmapause is the transitional region for the cavity mode resonance (Yeoman et al. 1991). In this study, we focus on a mid-latitude Pi 2 pulsation event that occurred around the plasmapause at 09 : 12 UT on August 19, 2010, and the event was evaluated with data that were obtained simultaneously on the duskside by three THEMIS satellites (THEMIS A (THA), THEMIS D (THD), and THEMIS E (THE)) as well as the mid-latitude Unwin, Tiger, and Hokkaido SuperDARN radars and ground magnetometer stations. Based on these observations, we compared the spectral properties of Pi 2 pulsations and found that they had both fundamental and second-harmonic frequencies. The enhancement of the power spectral density of second harmonics was radially localized in a small area at mid latitudes near the plasmapause. We will show that the Pi 2 pulsations were excited by propagating fast-mode waves, which were generated by the cavity mode resonance on the nightside with a harmonic structure.|$|R
