5|$|Although Poedjangga Baroe {{writers were}} united by nationalism, they had {{different}} views on traditional culture. Some, such as Armijn and Alisjahbana, considered an understanding <b>of</b> <b>Western</b> <b>culture</b> and history key to development. Others, such Sanusi, {{emphasized the need}} for Eastern values, though they accepted some aspects <b>of</b> <b>Western</b> <b>culture.</b> Writers for Poedjangga Baroe did not share religious views. Main contributors, including the founders, came from religious backgrounds ranging from near-secularism to orthodox Islam. Stemming from these conflicting cultural views, between September 1935 and June 1939, numerous polemics {{were published in the}} magazine, discussing the best course of action for Indonesian cultural development.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{the tree}} of heaven has a long and rich history. It was {{mentioned}} in the oldest extant Chinese dictionary and listed in countless Chinese medical texts for its purported ability to cure ailments ranging from mental illness to baldness. The roots, leaves and bark are still used today in traditional Chinese medicine, primarily as an astringent. The tree has been grown extensively both in China and abroad as a host plant for the ailanthus silkmoth, a moth involved in silk production. Ailanthus has become a part <b>of</b> <b>western</b> <b>culture</b> as well, with the tree serving as the central metaphor and {{subject matter of the}} best-selling American novel A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no clear {{evidence}} that the flower's name derives directly from the Greek myth, this link between the flower and the myth became firmly part <b>of</b> <b>western</b> <b>culture.</b> The narcissus or daffodil is the most loved of all English plants, and appears frequently in English literature. Many English writers have referred to the cultural and symbolic importance of Narcissus). No flower has received more poetic description except the rose and the lily, with poems by authors from John Gower, Shakespeare, Milton (see Roman culture, above), Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats. Frequently the poems deal with self-love derived from Ovid's account. Gower's reference to the yellow flower of the legend has been assumed to be the daffodil or Narcissus, though as with all references in the older literature to the flower that sprang from the youth's death, there is room for some debate as to the exact species of flower indicated, some preferring Crocus. Spenser announces the coming of the Daffodil in Aprill of his Shepheardes Calender (1579).|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20th century, Peking opera {{witnessed}} a steady decline in audience numbers. This has been attributed both to a decrease in performance quality and an inability of the traditional opera form to capture modern life. Furthermore, the archaic language of Peking opera required productions to use electronic subtitles, which hampered the development of the form. The influence <b>of</b> <b>Western</b> <b>culture</b> has also left the younger generations impatient with the slow pacing of Peking opera. In response, Peking opera began to see reform starting in the 1980s. Such reforms have taken the form of creating a school of performance theory to increase performance quality, employing modern elements to attract new audiences, and performing new plays outside of the traditional canon. However, these reforms have been hampered by both a lack of funding and an adverse political climate that makes the performance of new plays difficult.|$|E

40|$|For some, <b>Western</b> <b>culture</b> is {{not only}} a form of civilization  par  excellencebut also a culture that is immune from any critique. Still for some, <b>Western</b> <b>culture</b> is a high culture while other {{cultures}} are low cultures. Furthermore, post-colonial studies maintain that <b>Western</b> <b>culture</b> occupies the centre of human civilization while other cultures are at the periphery. The thrust of this latter view is that the <b>Western</b> <b>culture</b> may dominate and rule other cultures. Hence, the real nature <b>of</b> the <b>Western</b> <b>culture</b> is that <b>of</b> hegemony. Now, <b>Western</b> <b>culture</b> has been manifested in many habits and traditions such as pornography, homosexuality, and other form of cultural identity which are malevolent in their nature. In this regard, this paper is interested to show that ‘Urf (local custom) as a framework of analysis commonly used by the scholars of Islam can be appropriated to challenge the hegemonic view <b>of</b> the <b>Western</b> <b>culture</b> and to prove that in fact <b>Western</b> <b>culture</b> can occupy not the centre of human civilization but the periphery...|$|R

Asian-Americans struggle a lot in American society because their culture and home life encourage introversion, but their social lives outside the home put pressure on them to be extroverted.|$|R
