5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} {{has been observed}} only {{for the first three}} members of the group; chemical properties of both actinium and especially lawrencium are not well-characterized. The remaining elements of the group (scandium, yttrium, lutetium) are reactive metals with high melting points (1541°C, 1526°C, 1652°C respectively). They are usually oxidized to the +3 oxidation state, even through scandium, yttrium and lanthanum can form lower oxidation states. The reactivity of the elements, especially yttrium, is not always obvious due to the formation of a stable <b>oxide</b> layer, which prevents further reactions. Scandium(III) <b>oxide,</b> yttrium(III) <b>oxide,</b> lanthanum(III) <b>oxide</b> and lutetium(III) <b>oxide</b> are white high-temperature-melting solids. Yttrium(III) <b>oxide</b> and lutetium(III) <b>oxide</b> exhibit weak basic character, but scandium(III) <b>oxide</b> is amphoteric. Lanthanum(III) <b>oxide</b> is strongly basic.|$|E
