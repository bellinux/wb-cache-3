The Office of Special Counsel began an investigation to determine whether the e-mails represented a violation of the federal Hatch Act, which, among other things, prohibits employees involved in federally funded programs from using their authority to influence political campaigns. As a result of the probe, in 2010 the Common Council decided to delay her reappointment as commissioner until the investigation concluded. She had been serving in an interim capacity.

Similarly, the use <b>of</b> <b>e-mails</b> facilitates language revitalization in the sense that speakers of a minority language who moved to a location where their native language is not being spoken {{can take advantage of the}} Internet to communicate with their family and friends, thus maintaining the use of their native language.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>e-mail</b> on individuals and organizations {{and to provide a}} framework that frames e-mail management as a complex and multi-stranded issue. Design/methodology/approach – The paper employs a multi-dimensional appraisal <b>of</b> <b>e-mail</b> use in organisations and introduces a management framework as a practical tool to enact change and organisational learning. The approach uses Lee's five central concepts for understanding hermeneutics: distanciation; autonomization; appropriation; social construction; and enactment, applying these to the problem <b>of</b> <b>e-mail</b> overload. Findings – This paper contributes to the theoretical understanding <b>of</b> <b>e-mail</b> use in organisations, and develops a practitioner toolkit for enacting change in e-mail use. This work uses hermeneutics and an interpretive framework to investigate the impact <b>of</b> <b>e-mail</b> on organisations, employing concepts from Ricoeur, Gadamer, Habermas, and Klein. Research limitations/implications – Future research could evaluate the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>e-mail</b> performance improvement programmes using a mix of research methods including surveys <b>of</b> <b>e-mail</b> attitudes and analysis <b>of</b> <b>e-mail</b> readability and language analysis. Practical implications – The paper introduces an e-mail management framework that is a practical tool {{that can be used to}} enact change and organisational learning Social implications – Implementation could lead to improved communication; improved visibility of the informal organizational network, knowledge sharing, and action network; business process improvement; improved knowledge management; and increased employee morale. Originality/value – The paper shows how actors may choose to enact emancipation from e-mail oppression by taking deliberate action to reconstruct the environment in which they exist in an inquiry-change cycle of organisational learning by implementing an e-mail management framework...|$|R
40|$|Since {{communication}} {{plays an}} important role in the work of managers they are likely to be significant users <b>of</b> <b>e-mail</b> in their daily work. Managers are also influential in technology acceptance and in policy formation. Thus investigating e-mail use by managers is particularly relevant to advance the understanding of organisational efforts to maximize benefits and to minimize problems with e-mail communication. This paper reports on the findings of a survey of managerial use <b>of</b> <b>e-mail</b> within Australian and Hong Kong. The results suggest that while the primary use <b>of</b> <b>e-mail</b> is currently for inter-organisational communication and that e-mail is consuming large amounts of managerial time, particularly for more senior managers. A significant proportion <b>of</b> <b>e-mail</b> received did not appear to contribute to productivity, with both personal e-mails and marketing e-mails constituting a significant proportion <b>of</b> received <b>e-mails.</b> The study suggests that e-mail use will grow as individual and organisational experience increases.

40|$|This master thesis {{looks at}} how {{electronic}} mail (e-mail) should be assessed when used as evidence. There are two parts, a theoretical part {{that focus on}} the technical properties <b>of</b> <b>e-mail,</b> and a practical part which includes a test <b>of</b> selected <b>e-mail</b> clients. The practical part was done to test the robustness <b>of</b> <b>e-mail</b> clients against manipulation. The main focus is on the properties <b>of</b> <b>e-mail</b> messages, and how they can be manipulated in various ways. By using a technical approach it is possible to analyze how strong an e-mail is as evidence. Closely related to the technical properties <b>of</b> <b>e-mail,</b> is the actors involved from the e-mail is sent to it is received. An overview of actors, and their functions in the process <b>of</b> transmitting <b>e-mail,</b> will also be presented.

25|$|One of {{the most}} popular Internet-related {{technologies}} to be studied under this perspective is e-mail, which has expanded the stylistics of languages in many ways. A study done on the linguistic profile <b>of</b> <b>e-mails</b> has shown that there is a hybrid of speech and writing styles in terms of format, grammar and style. E-mail is rapidly replacing traditional letter-writing because of its convenience, speed and spontaneity. It is often related to informality as it feels temporary and can be deleted easily. However, as this medium of communication matures, e-mail is no longer confined to sending informal messages between friends and relatives. Instead, business correspondences are increasingly being carried out through e-mails. Job seekers are also using e-mails to send their resumes to potential employers. The result of a move towards more formal usages will be a medium representing a range of formal and informal stylistics.|$|E

Santos auditioned for an Australian band that moved to America called Cryogenic. Although he thought the band was not for him, he met the band's bassist Henno. As Cryogenic and Mudrock, who were working together, had both lost their vocalists, Henno contacted Santos and asked him to join the band, to which Santos accepted. Ryan Ready, who Santos had known since high-school, was recruited as the second guitarist. The band's original name was announced as Silent Civilians, which originates from the world's climate change by that people have opinions on life and politics and they do not voice their beliefs, living in a nation full of 'silent civilians'.|$|E

By analyzing the structural properties <b>of</b> <b>e-mail</b> networks, first we confirm that legitimate e-mail traffic generates a small-world, scale-free network that can be modeled similarly to many other social networks, but we also show that, contrary to previous work, e-mail traffic as a whole does not exhibit a scale-free behavior. We show that this deviation is caused by the unsocial behavior <b>of</b> unsolicited <b>e-mail</b> traffic. We also analyze how various structural properties <b>of</b> <b>e-mail</b> networks change over time and reveal the structural properties that are indicative of the unsocial behavior of spam traffic. Finally, we show that our findings can be used to identify spam traffic in regular e-mail traffic without inspecting the e-mail contents...|$|R

Earlier the same year, President George Bush had named North Korea as one of three members of the Axis of Evil, which had upset some South Koreans; directing their anger at Ohno was a less direct way of voicing anger against Bush's decision. The controversy continued at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, held jointly in South Korea and Japan several months after the Olympics. When the South Korean football (soccer) team scored a goal against the U.S. team, Korean players Ahn Jung-Hwan and Lee Chun-Soo made an exaggerated move imitating the move Ohno had made during the speed skating event to indicate the other athlete had drifted into his lane.|$|E
