5|$|Faced with dwindling attendances, the Kilcoynes {{decided to}} starve {{the club and}} sold off senior players who were {{replaced}} by junior footballers. On a tour of Japan in 1975, Mick Meagan and Theo Dunne’s young side defeated the Japanese national team 3–2 in front of 60,000 spectators at the Olympic Stadium, but that victory was the highlight of a season that saw the team finish bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> re-apply for admission into the League of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes and another observer {{on either side of}} him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands was placed on the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> the other inside the cage which held an accordion on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light in the room was not stated, and {{the accordion}} was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have come from an automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside {{the main body of}} the table, at the end of each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals. This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871, which contained the modern carbon group (group 14), titanium group (group 4), cerium, and thorium, because their maximum oxidation state was +4. Cerium was soon removed from the main body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> placed in a separate lanthanide series; thorium was left with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as titanium and zirconium.|$|E

5|$|In {{their first}} season since {{the return of}} the Football League, Cardiff {{finished}} the 1946–47 season as champions of the Third Division South under new manager Billy McCandless and returned to the Second Division. McCandless left the club soon after and was replaced by Cyril Spiers who led the side to promotion in the 1951–52 season, returning to the top tier of English football {{for the first time in}} 23 years. However, despite spending five seasons in the First Division, the team continually struggled in the bottom half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> were eventually relegated in 1957. They returned to the First Division for two seasons between 1960 and 1962 before again suffering relegation.|$|E
5|$|Wright's Air Pump {{was unusual}} {{in that it}} {{depicted}} archetypes rather than specific people, though various models for the figures have been suggested. The young lovers may {{have been based on}} Thomas Coltman and Mary Barlow, friends of Wright's, whom he later painted in Mr and Mrs Thomas Coltman (also in the National Gallery) after their marriage in 1769; Erasmus Darwin has been suggested as the man timing the experiment on the left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> John Warltire, whom Darwin had invited to help with some air pump experiments in real life, as the natural philosopher; but Wright never identified any of the subjects or suggested they were based on real people.|$|E
5|$|York mostly {{occupied}} {{the bottom half}} of the table before the turn of the year, and dropped as low as 23rd in September 2013. During February 2014 the team broke into the top half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> with one match left were in sixth-place. York's defensive record was the third best in League Two with 41 goals conceded, bettered only by Southend (39) and Chesterfield (40). Davies made the highest number of appearances over the season, appearing in 47 of York's 52 matches. Fletcher was York's top scorer in the league and in all competitions, with 10 league goals and 13 in total. He was the only player to reach double figures, and was followed by Jarvis with nine goals.|$|E

5|$|York {{spent most}} of the season in midtable, and having been as low as 19th in the table in November went on to reach sixth place during the last month of the season. The team's goals scored tally of 55 was the lowest of any team in the top half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> the sixth lowest of any team in the division. Ingham and Meredith made the highest number of {{appearances}} during the season, each appearing in 51 of York's 52 matches.

He was the only player to reach double figures, and was followed by Reed with nine goals.|$|E
5|$|Amos {{was born}} in Macclesfield, Cheshire {{and was a member}} of the Crewe Alexandra academy until he was {{released}} at the age of 10. While at Crewe, he also played for another local team, Bollington United, as a centre midfielder. One year later, Amos was playing for his local team against the team at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> they needed to win the match to win the league. Amos' team's goalkeeper was injured during the game, and as the tallest on the team, Amos was put in goal; however, he had also been the team's regular penalty taker all season, so when they were awarded a penalty, he went all the way up the pitch to take the kick. He scored, and his team went on to win the game 3–2, together with the league title. After the game, his parents told him that a Manchester United scout had been watching him and that he had been invited for trials. Amos joined Manchester United at the age of 11.|$|E
5|$|Ben Arfa's play {{during the}} 2010 {{portion of the}} season earned praise from both Deschamps and {{sporting}} director José Anigo. On 10 January 2010, Ben Arfa scored his first goal of the season against amateur club Trélissac in the Coupe de France. A month later, he was instrumental in Marseille's 5–1 victory over Valenciennes assisting on the opening goal scored by Lucho González. Later that month, Ben Arfa scored an away goal in {{the first leg of}} the club's UEFA Europa League tie against Danish club FC København. In the return leg in Marseille, Ben Arfa struck again, scoring the opening goal in the 43rd minute. Marseille won the match 3–1 and the tie 6–2 on aggregate. On 27 February, he scored his first league goal of the season in a 3–0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain. Ben Arfa's play in the month of February was validated when he was named the UNFP Player of the Month. Marseille won all four of the league matches the team contested with Ben Arfa starting all of them. On 7 April, Ben Arfa converted a penalty in a 3–0 win over Sochaux. The victory placed the club at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> they remained there {{for the rest of the}} season and clinched the title on 5 May with a 3–1 win over Rennes. Ben Arfa appeared as a substitute in the match.|$|E

5|$|John Carver, {{right-hand}} man to former Barcelona manager Sir Bobby Robson at Newcastle United, arrived as the club's new assistant manager on 17 December 2009, but the club suffered another 1–0 defeat at home, against Coventry City, two days later. Argyle travelled to Cardiff on Boxing Day to play Cardiff City at their new stadium, and {{came away with}} an important three points thanks to a late goal from Sawyer. They recorded their biggest win of the season two days later against Reading. A brace from Judge, and first goals of the season for Kári Árnason and Ashley Barnes secured a 4–1 win at Home Park and six points from their two games over the Christmas period. Argyle returned to league action after their FA Cup ties on 16 January, looking for another three points against Crystal Palace but an early goal from young striker Victor Moses won the game for the visitors. Another must-win home game followed against Derby County and a fifth goal of the season from Jamie Mackie boosted their survival bid. A defeat by fellow struggler's Sheffield Wednesday, coupled with other results going against them, left Argyle five points from safety, with a tough match to come against West Bromwich Albion a week later. A single goal from striker Simon Cox kept Albion in touch at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> left Argyle deep in relegation trouble again, six points from safety.|$|E
5|$|York {{appointed}} former Manchester United manager Wilf McGuinness in February 1975, and {{he helped}} them stay in the Second Division in 1974–75. However, York faced successive relegations under McGuinness, when finishing 21st in 1975–76 {{and bottom of the}} Third Division in 1976–77. He was dismissed in October 1977, with York 22nd in the Fourth Division, and was succeeded by former Charlton Athletic player Charlie Wright in November. He could not prevent a re-election bid after 1977–78, before leading York to 10th place the following season. Wright was dismissed in March 1980 with the team near the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> under caretaker manager Barry Lyons York finished 17th in 1979–80. He was appointed permanently in May 1980, and York finished bottom of the table in his first full season in charge. York continued to struggle and Lyons was dismissed in December 1981; Kevin Randall and Barry Swallow each had spells in caretaker charge, before York finished 17th in 1981–82.|$|E
5|$|York player Neil Thompson {{took over}} as {{caretaker}} manager, but {{he was unable to}} avoid relegation to the Third Division, after a defeat {{on the last day of}} 1998–99. He was appointed permanently in May 1999, but was dismissed in February 2000 with York 21st in the table. Former Hull City manager Terry Dolan was appointed and he led York clear of relegation in 1999–2000. Despite off-pitch problems at the club, York were in an automatic promotion place by late-March 2003, before finishing 10th in 2002–03. York player Chris Brass was appointed player-manager in June 2003; aged 27, this made him the youngest managerial appointment in the Football League since 1946. Having been 10th in the table in January 2004, York went 20 matches without a win and were relegated to the Conference National after 2003–04, which brought to an end 75 years of Football League membership. Brass was dismissed in November 2004 with York fourth from bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> his assistant Viv Busby took caretaker charge before the appointment of former Derby County coach Billy McEwan in February 2005.|$|E

5|$|York started 1976–77 poorly, {{and they}} were in the bottom two of the Third Division for most {{of the first half of}} the season. The midseason signings Chris Galvin and Gordon Staniforth marked an {{improvement}} in results, but after winning only one of their last 15 matches they finished in bottom place and were relegated for the second successive season. The 1977–78 season also started poorly; York lost seven of their opening 12 matches, leaving them 17th in the table. McGuinness was dismissed in October 1977 and was succeeded the following month by Charlie Wright, a former Charlton Athletic player. York remained in the lower reaches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> finished the season in 22nd place, forcing the club to apply for re-election for the sixth time. This was successful, as the club polled the maximum number of votes. This season, attendances fell to an all-time low, and amid growing financial trouble, Michael Sinclair took over as chairman in April 1978 in a boardroom shuffle. Results improved in 1978–79; York finished 10th in the Fourth Division and reached the FA Cup fourth round. They played reigning First Division champions and European Cup winners-elect Nottingham Forest, and were beaten 3–1 at the City Ground. In 1979–80, York were consistently in the lower reaches of the table, before finishing 17th. With the club 18th in the table by mid March 1980, Wright was dismissed. Youth coach Barry Lyons succeeded him, initially as caretaker manager, before being appointed permanently in May 1980.|$|E
