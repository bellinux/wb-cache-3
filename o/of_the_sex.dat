5|$|Opinions on the sex {{industry}} are diverse. Feminists critical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> industry generally {{see it as the}} exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists who support at least part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> industry argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and a means for women to take control of their sexuality.|$|E

5|$|The Year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> Olympics is a 1968 {{television}} play {{made by the}} BBC {{and first}} broadcast on BBC2 as part of Theatre 625. It stars Leonard Rossiter, Tony Vogel, Suzanne Neve and Brian Cox. It was directed by Michael Elliott. The writer was Nigel Kneale, {{best known as the}} creator of Quatermass.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} critical {{success was}} The Year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> Olympics, broadcast {{as part of}} BBC2's Theatre 625 series in July 1968. Kneale's first television work {{to be made in}} colour—although only a black-and-white copy now survives—the story was based in a future where {{the majority of the population}} are kept in a docile state by constant broadcasts of pornography and other low-brow reality television programming. The Live Life Show, in which a family are watched twenty-four hours a day as they struggle to live on an isolated rural island, becomes a massive success, especially when a murderer is introduced into the set-up.|$|E
5|$|As often {{happened}} in this era, the colour master tapes of The Year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> Olympics were wiped some time after broadcast and the play was believed lost until the 1980s when {{a black and white}} telerecording was discovered. This copy was released on DVD, with an introduction by film and television historian Kim Newman, a commentary by actor Brian Cox and a copy of the original script, by the British Film Institute in 2003.|$|E

5|$|Bernard Rhodes, a {{sometime}} {{associate of}} McLaren and friend <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> Pistols, was similarly aiming to make {{stars of the}} band London SS. Early in 1976, London SS broke up before ever performing publicly, spinning off two new bands: the Damned and the Clash, which was joined by Joe Strummer, former lead singer of the 101'ers. On June 4, 1976, the Sex Pistols played Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall in {{what came to be}} {{regarded as one of the}} most influential rock shows ever. Among the approximately forty audience members were the two locals who organised the gig—they had formed Buzzcocks after seeing the Sex Pistols in February. Others in the small crowd went on to form Joy Division, the Fall, and—in the 1980s—the Smiths.|$|E
5|$|In early September, Levene {{was fired}} from the Clash. Strummer would claim that Levene's dwindling {{interest}} in the band owed to his supposedly extravagant use of speed, a charge Levene has denied. Levene and Lydon would form Public Image Ltd. in 1978. On 21 September, the Clash performed publicly {{for the first time}} without Levene at another seminal concert: the 100 Club Punk Special, sharing the bill with the Sex Pistols, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect. Chimes left in late November; he was briefly replaced by Rob Harper as the Clash toured in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> Pistols during December's Anarchy Tour.|$|E
5|$|Lynott {{replaced}} Robertson with Gary Moore again, {{and around}} this time the band loosely joined forces with Steve Jones and Paul Cook <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> Pistols, and also with Chris Spedding and Jimmy Bain, to form The Greedy Bastards, who played {{a small number of}} gigs playing a varied selection of songs. In this way Lynott was able to align his band with the punk movement and avoid being tagged as a 'dinosaur' as many other 1970s rock bands had been. Other occasional members of The Greedy Bastards included Bob Geldof and Pete Briquette of the Boomtown Rats.|$|E

5|$|Nigel Kneale was a Manx {{television}} playwright who {{had first}} come to {{prominence in the}} 1950s thanks to his three Quatermass serials and his controversial adaptation of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, {{all of which were}} produced by the BBC. Going freelance in the nineteen-sixties, Kneale had produced scripts for Associated Television and for Hammer Films. In the late nineteen-sixties and early nineteen-seventies, Kneale had been coaxed back to the BBC, writing such plays as The Year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> Olympics, Wine of India and, for the anthology series Out of the Unknown, The Chopper.|$|E
5|$|Prostitutes are {{the lowest}} and meanest, so {{are they the}} basest, vilest, and wickedest of all Creatures. It is a trite Observation, that when a Woman quits her Modesty, she {{discards}} with it every other Virtue. To extend this to every frail Individual <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sex,</b> is to carry it too far; but if it be confined {{to those who are}} become infamous by public Prostitution, no Maxim, I believe, hath a greater Foundation in Truth, or will be more strongly verified by Experience.|$|E
5|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} has been legal in Ireland since 16 November 2015. A referendum on 22 May 2015 amended the Constitution of Ireland {{to provide that}} marriage is recognised irrespective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> of the partners. The measure {{was signed into law}} by the President of Ireland as the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland on 29 August 2015. The Marriage Act 2015, passed by the Oireachtas on 22 October 2015 and signed into law by the Presidential Commission on 29 October 2015, gave legislative effect to the amendment. Marriages of same-sex couples in Ireland began being recognised from 16 November 2015 and the first marriage ceremonies of same-sex couples in Ireland occurred on 17 November 2015.|$|E

5|$|The script {{calls for}} one actor to play both male {{characters}}Jason and the pimp. Jason and Number 18 are haunted by four voices. As poetic and prophetic voices, these characters serve {{much the same}} purpose as a chorus in Greek tragedies, according to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate. Variously considered angels or ghosts, the voices are written in the script to be played by the female actors who portray Number 18, Marta, Ali, and Mama. While these voices sometimes emphasize the horrors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> industry, at other times, they offer comfort to Number 18. It is only revealed at the play's conclusion that the chorus {{is made up of}} dead child prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|The uniform {{made its}} Olympic debut at Sydney's Bondi Beach in the 2000 Summer Olympics amid some criticism. It {{was the fifth}} largest {{television}} audience of all the sports at the 2000 Games. Much of the interest was because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> appeal of bikini-clad players along with their athletic ability. Bikini-clad dancers and cheerleaders entertain the audience during match breaks in many beach volleyball tournaments, including the Olympics. Even indoor volleyball costumes followed suit to become smaller and tighter.|$|E
5|$|Frequency {{estimates}} vary enormously. In 2015 it {{was estimated}} that 37.2 million people globally are affected. A 2003 review of epidemiological studies of children found autism rates ranging from 0.03 to 4.84 per 1,000, with the ratio of autism to Asperger syndrome ranging from 1.5:1 to 16:1; combining the geometric mean ratio of 5:1 with a conservative prevalence estimate for autism of 1.3 per 1,000 suggests indirectly that the prevalence of AS might be around 0.26 per 1,000. Part of the variance in estimates arises from differences in diagnostic criteria. For example, a relatively small 2007 study of 5,484 eight-year-old children in Finland found 2.9 children per 1,000 met the ICD-10 criteria for an AS diagnosis, 2.7 per 1,000 for Gillberg and Gillberg criteria, 2.5 for DSM-IV, 1.6 for Szatmari et al., and 4.3 per 1,000 for the union of the four criteria. Boys seem to be more likely to have AS than girls; estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> ratio range from 1.6:1 to 4:1, using the Gillberg and Gillberg criteria. Females with autism spectrum disorders may be underdiagnosed.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} prostitution at Streetlight Support Services. Once she received her diploma from George Brown College, she redeveloped the organization's Choices program, a four-week program that helps women leave prostitution. Between 1997 and 2005, Choices helped 325 women out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> trade. Women {{entered into the}} program through {{the criminal justice system}} after being arrested for offences related to prostitution. By 2011, Falle had conselled more than 800 women. Of these women, 97% wrote on their intake surveys that they wanted to exit the sex industry, and 95% wrote that they had been physically abused by either a pimp, a client, or another woman in the sex industry. Falle believed these statistics to be representative of women in prostitution in Canada because the women she counselled did not come to her by choice; they were required to undergo the counselling by court order. In 2010, Falle said that hundreds of the women she had met were controlled by pimps, either as sexual partners or as traffickers. She also said that women in prostitution tend to be moved around a lot because they tend to fetch higher prices when they are new to a region. One of the women she counselled through Streetlight Support Services had been kept in a closet when she was not providing sexual services to men.|$|E
5|$|Logan informs Veronica {{about the}} sex tape {{of her and}} Piz and hands her a DVD, {{although}} she berates him and denies that the recording is authentic. She views the tape and goes to visit Piz, who is badly bruised. She makes sure that Piz did not upload the footage to the internet, which he confirms. After learning that Logan had attacked Piz, Parker visits Logan's hotel room and tearfully breaks up with him, claiming that he still loves Veronica. Veronica goes to Logan's hotel room and berates him for attacking Piz. She confronts Dick about the origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> tape, and he reveals that he got it from Chip Diller before forwarding it to his whole address book. She investigates further before encountering a student who refuses to tell her anything. She gets Weevil to destroy the student's car, and he names the individual, whom she later wiretaps.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious {{asserts that}} there is a link between the {{international}} sex industry and legal prostitution in the Western world, and that those who create the demand for forced prostitution around the world are {{of a wide variety of}} ages and are often considered respectable. The film contrasts the secretiveness and brutality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> industry in Eastern Europe with the openness of public prostitution in the Netherlands. Nefarious suggests that sex trafficking in Southeast Asia is fuelled largely by the complicity of the victims' parents, with many in Cambodia grooming and then knowingly selling their daughters into prostitution to pay for luxury goods. The film asserts that 10% of the population of Moldova has been sexually trafficked. Nefarious contrasts Las Vegas prostitutes with victims of sex trafficking in Europe, depicting the former as drawn into the sex industry by dreams of a glamorous lifestyle, and the latter as made vulnerable by child abandonment and orphanages.|$|E
