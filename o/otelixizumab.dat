50|$|Tolerx’s lead product candidate, <b>otelixizumab,</b> {{also known}} as TRX4, is a novel {{monoclonal}} antibody being developed {{for the treatment of}} autoimmune type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases. The efficacy and safety of <b>otelixizumab</b> in the treatment of type 1 diabetes is currently being studied in a pivotal Phase 3 study called DEFEND (Durable-response therapy Evaluation For Early or New-onset type 1 Diabetes). Tolerx entered into a collaboration with Glaxo SmithKline in October 2007 relating to the development and commercialization of <b>otelixizumab.</b> <b>Otelixizumab</b> has been granted Orphan Drug Status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.|$|E
50|$|As a {{monoclonal}} antibody, <b>otelixizumab</b> {{consists of}} two heavy chains and two light chains. The heavy chains are humanized γ1 (gamma-1) chains from rats, making <b>otelixizumab</b> an immunoglobulin G1. The light chains are chimeric human/rat λ (lambda) chains.|$|E

50|$|Proof of {{concept was}} {{established}} in a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. These data demonstrated <b>otelixizumab’s</b> ability to preserve beta cell function, as measured by C-peptide, in patients up to 18 months after dosing, as well as {{reduce the need for}} delivered insulin to maintain glucose control.|$|R
50|$|<b>Otelixizumab</b> is one {{of several}} investigational {{monoclonal}} antibodies that target CD3, a T lymphocyte receptor involved in normal cell signaling. More specifically, <b>otelixizumab</b> targets the epsilon chain of CD3. Data suggest that the drug works by blocking the function of effector T cells, which mistakenly attack and destroy insulin-producing beta cells, while stimulating regulatory T cells, which are understood to protect against effector T cell damage, thus preserving the beta cells' normal ability to make insulin.|$|E
50|$|Anti-CD3 antibodies, {{including}} teplizumab and <b>otelixizumab,</b> {{had suggested}} evidence of preserving insulin production (as evidenced by sustained C-peptide production) in newly diagnosed {{type 1 diabetes}} patients. A probable mechanism of this effect {{was believed to be}} preservation of regulatory T cells that suppress activation of the immune system and thereby maintain immune system homeostasis and tolerance to self-antigens. The duration of the effect is still unknown, however. In 2011, Phase III studies with <b>otelixizumab</b> and teplizumab both failed to show clinical efficacy, potentially due to an insufficient dosing schedule.|$|E
50|$|Because CD3 is {{required}} for T-cell activation, drugs (often monoclonal antibodies) that target it are being investigated as immunosuppressant therapies (e.g., <b>otelixizumab)</b> for type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases.|$|E

50|$|The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} <b>otelixizumab</b> {{for the treatment of}} autoimmune type 1 diabetes was studied in a pivotal Phase 3 study called DEFEND (Durable-response therapy Evaluation For Early or New-onset type 1 Diabetes). DEFEND was a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial designed to enroll approximately 240 adult patients, age 18 to 45, with newly diagnosed autoimmune type 1 diabetes. DEFEND was conducted at multiple centers in North America and Europe. The trial was designed to evaluate whether a single course of <b>otelixizumab,</b> administered not more than 90 days after the initial diagnosis, would reduce the amount of administered insulin required to control blood glucose levels by inhibiting the destruction of beta cells. The trial failed to show efficacy of the treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Newer {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{in development}} {{with the same}} mechanism of action include <b>otelixizumab</b> (also known as TRX4), teplizumab (also known as hOKT3γ1(Ala-Ala) [...] ), and visilizumab (with a tentative trade name of Nuvion). They are being investigated {{for the treatment of}} other conditions like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and type 1 diabetes. Further development of teplizumab is uncertain, due to one-year data from a recent Phase III trial being [...] "disappointing".|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} agents currently under investigation that {{are capable of}} modulating T cells. Currently used agents include anti-thymocyte globulin(ATG) and alemtuzumab, which not only affect T cells, but are also capable of modulating many other aspects of the immune system, often resulting in long-term broad spectrum immune suppression. Antibodies specific for CD3 such as teplizumab and <b>otelixizumab</b> show increased specificity for T cells compared to ATG and alemtuzumab, but are still associated with infection and cytokine release syndrome. Targeting the αβ T cells with TOL101 may reduce these issues through two mechanisms. First, infections are expected to be reduced through the preservation of γδ T cells, which have been shown {{to play an important role}} in controlling viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), often observed in antibody treated patients. Second, reductions in cytokine release are expected when targeting the αβ TCR because, unlike CD3 proteins, the αβ TCR contains none of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMS) required for T cell activation.|$|E
40|$|Background & Aims T cells {{mediate the}} {{development}} of inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We investigated the effects of an antibody against CD 3 called <b>otelixizumab,</b> which induces immune tolerance, in intestinal mucosa samples from patients. Methods Intestinal tissues were isolated from patients undergoing routine endoscopy or from patients undergoing intestinal surgery for colon cancer or IBD; healthy surrounding tissues were collected as controls. Isolated lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) and mucosal tissue explants were incubated with <b>otelixizumab</b> for 24 or 48 hours. Production of inflammatory cytokines was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of 36 cytokines and chemokines and phosphorylation of 39 receptor tyrosine kinases and signaling molecules were measured using protein arrays. Immunoblot {{analysis was used to}} analyze T-cell transcription factors. Results Incubation of intestinal tissues or LPMCs with <b>otelixizumab</b> reduced production of interferon gamma, interleukin (IL) - 17 A, and other inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, simultaneously increasing production of IL- 10. Mucosal biopsy specimens from patients with IBD retained inflammation-associated tyrosine phosphoprotein profiles ex vivo. Incubation of the inflamed tissue with <b>otelixizumab</b> reduced phosphorylation of these proteins to levels observed in control tissues. <b>Otelixizumab</b> also markedly reduced phosphorylation of proteins associated with T-cell receptor activation.

40|$|<b>Otelixizumab</b> is a {{chimeric}} CD 3 antibody {{that has}} been genetically engineered to remove the glycosylation site in the Fc domain. This limits its ability to bind to complement or Fc receptors and {{reduces the risk of}} adverse clinical reactions due to cytokine release. In a trial for treatment of type 1 diabetes, a short treatment with <b>otelixizumab</b> resulted in a reduced requirement for insulin lasting at least 18 months. In the course of this trial, the blood concentrations of the antibody were measured by flow cytometry to determine its pharmacokinetic profile. Dose-dependent accumulation of <b>otelixizumab</b> was demonstrated and modeling of the data indicated that the terminal half-life was approximately 1. 5 days. Antibody responses to <b>otelixizumab</b> were measured by 2 methods: a bridging enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance. The surface plasmon resonance method had a greater sensitivity and was able to detect responses in all patients, starting at 8 days after the commencement of therapy. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in a significant proportion of patients by days 22 to 29. Although no adverse clinical effects were associated with these antibody responses and they did not appear to affect the clearance of the drug, they might have important implications for possible retreatment of the patients. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{demonstrated}} that the anti-CD 3 monoclonal antibody otelixizu-mab, administered at a total dose of 48 – 64 mg, can slow the loss of C-peptide in recent-onset type 1 diabetes patients, with frequent reactivation of Epstein Barr virus (EBV). The DEFEND- 1 (Durable Response Therapy Evaluation for Early or New-Onset Type 1 Diabetes) trial was designed to test whether a lower dose of <b>otelixizumab</b> could preserve C-peptide secretion in new-onset type 1 diabetes patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed in sites in the U. S., Canada, and Europe. Two hundred eighty-one patients were randomized to treatment with 3. 1 mg <b>otelixizumab</b> administered over 8 days or placebo.

40|$|Individuals under 20 {{years old}} {{have the highest}} risk of {{developing}} type 1 diabetes because their beta cells are destroyed {{at a faster rate}} than any other age group. Previous studies have looked at delaying and slowing down the rate of beta cell destruction through the use of anti-CD 3 antibody treatments. Specifically, Teplizumab and <b>Otelixizumab</b> drug therapies have been used to treat individuals within 12 weeks of diagnosis. Previous studies done with Teplizumab and <b>Otelixizumab</b> have focused on individuals between 12 and 40 years old; however, there is little research done the effects of these treatments on individuals under 12 years old. Since type 1 diabetes is primarily diagnosed in children the purpose of this proposal is to further the knowledge of the preservation of beta cells in children with the use of Teplizumab and <b>Otelixizumab</b> drugs over 2 years. This study will also focus on the delay of onset type 1 diabetes with the use of Teplizumab in high-risk individuals under 20 years of age. The high-risk individuals will be determined by using genetic screening on individuals with an affected immediate family member. Individuals will also be tested to see if they carry insulin autoantibodies (IAA), protein tyrosine phosphate-related IA- 2 molecule (IA- 2 A), islet cell antibodies (ICA), and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA). Individuals that test positive for carrying the DR 3 /DR 4 alleles in the genetic screening and that have two or more autoantibodies present in their immune systems will be selected to participate. The purpose of this proposal is to further understand the impact of anti-CD 3 antibody treatment on young individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and to further understand if treatment in young individuals with anti-CD 3 antibodies can delay or prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Anti-CD 3 {{antibodies}} {{have been}} demonstrated in both animal and human studies {{to be able to}} reverse autoimmune diseases; for example Type 1 diabetes. Not only does treatment with anti-CD 3 antibodies result in the removal of pathogenic T cells but evidence suggests that a state of operational tolerance can be induced through the effects on regulatory T cells. The clinical use of anti-CD 3 antibodies has been hampered by their safety profile. However, the introduction of humanized, nonmitogenic, aglycosylated anti-CD 3 antibodies, such as <b>otelixizumab,</b> and promising results reported in newly-diagnosed patients with Type 1 diabetes, have renewed the interest for these antibodies in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{have proven}} to be potent agents to promote immunological tolerance in animal models of autoimmune disease and transplantation. However, optimal clinical application and pharmaceutical development have been limited by the species specificity of therapeutic antibodies, as well exemplified in the case of anti-CD 3 antibodies. Compelling evidence in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, recently translated to clinical autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes, demonstrates that a short CD 3 antibody treatment effectively and durably controls disease progression. We established transgenic mice expressing the human ε chain of the CD 3 complex bred onto the NOD background. These mice developed a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes and harbored T cells sensitive both in vitro and in vivo to anti-human CD 3 antibodies. Treatment of diabetic transgenic mice with <b>otelixizumab,</b> an anti-human CD 3 antibody that has proven effective in the clinic, resulted in durable disease remission dependent on transferable T cell-mediated tolerance. This model should enable the evaluation of anti-human CD 3 antibodies to determine their potential clinical utility...|$|E
40|$|In type 1 diabetes, beta {{cells are}} {{attacked}} and destroyed by auto reactive T cells causing major impairment of blood glucose metabolism and, ultimately, {{the development of}} life-threatening complications. Currently, the treatment of this chronic disease {{is based on the}} use of endogenous insulin and no curative therapies are available. Treatment approaches in this respect need to be directed toward the primary causes of the disease tackling beta cells' auto reactive T cells. The goal of any curative intervention in type 1 diabetes is the preservation of insulin-secreting cells. This may be achieved by the abrogation of the pathogenic reactivity to beta cell auto antigens while preserving full capacity to generate a normal immune response against foreign antigens. In this review, some of the most promising drugs for immune intervention in type 1 diabetes are presented and discussed including phase 3 clinical trials that involve: DiaPep 277, Anti-CD 3 <b>Otelixizumab,</b> Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD) and anti-IL 1 receptor antagonist. These approaches are currently being tested in international multicenter trials and all of them have a very similar outcome in terms of a beneficial effect on beta cells...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{safety of}} any immune {{modulating}} agent in {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus (T 1 DM) involves its selectivity on autoimmunity and its preservation of recall and tumour immunity. METHODS: We performed lymphocyte proliferation tests on seven recent onset diabetic patients treated with anti-CD 3 (Otelixizumab; ChAglyCD 3) and five recent onset diabetic patients treated with placebo, on average 2 years after therapy. RESULTS: Proliferative responses towards common viral, bacterial and yeast antigens upon in vitro stimulation {{with a range of}} recall antigens in anti-CD 3 -treated T 1 DM patients were highly similar to those in placebo-treated T 1 DM patients. Similarly, T-cell responses towards autoantigens were equally low between the two groups, several years after diagnosis of T 1 DM. The proliferative response upon stimulation with the human suppressor protein p 53 was invariably high in both anti-CD 3 - and placebo-treated patients, implying preserved anti-tumour immunity in anti-CD 3 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: As long-term focus on side effects is key, we demonstrate in this sub-cohort of recent onset T 1 DM patients treated with <b>Otelixizumab</b> that recall immunity is preserved in spite of high-dose anti-CD 3 treatment, adding to the safety of anti-CD 3 treatment as an immune-modulatory agent in the treatment of T 1 DM...|$|E
30|$|Aglycosylated {{antibodies}} are {{suited for}} purposes where ADCC/CDC {{action is not}} required {{as is the case}} for neutralizing, agonistic or antagonistic antibodies. Numerous aglycosylated IgG antibodies are under clinical evaluation including <b>otelixizumab</b> (TRX 4), onartuzumab (MetMAb), and clazakizumab (ALD 518) (Ju and Jung, 2014; Jung et al., 2011). The use of aglycosylated IgG antibodies provides the following advantages: (1) The serum half-life of aglycosylated IgG is shown to be comparable to that of glycosylated counterpart in chimpanzees (Simmons et al., 2002); (2) Aglycosylated IgG can be produced in lower eukaryotes or in bacteria, which provides bioprocessing advantages in terms of shorter bioprocess development and running times without need to consider glycan heterogeneity problems; (3) Aglycosylated IgG antibodies maintain the ability to engage some of the FcγRs by a small subset of substitutions in the CH 2 and/or CH 3 domains. An aglycosylated IgG variant with S 298 G/T 299 A mutations has been identified that activates FcγRIIa (Sazinsky et al., 2008). In addition, an aglycosylated IgG variant with mutations E 382 V/M 428 I within the CH 3 domain has been shown to mediate cytotoxicity of target cells via FcγRI (Ju et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2010). Thus, engineering of aglycosylated IgG provides new routes for the design of therapeutic antibodies with customized functionality.|$|E
40|$|Pathogenesis of type 1 {{diabetes}} is multi-faceted, including, autoimmunity, genetics and environment. Autoimmunity directed against pancreatic islet cells results in slowly progressive selective beta-cell destruction ("Primary autoimmune insulitis"), culminating over years in clinically manifested insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Circulating serum autoantibodies directed against the endocrine cells of the islets of Langerhans (Islet cell autoantibodies - ICAb) are an important hallmark of this disease. Assays for islet cell autoantibodies have facilitated the investigation and understanding of several facets in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes. Their applications have extended into clinical practice and have opened new avenues for early preclinical prediction and preventive prophylaxis in IDDM/type 1 DM. Recently, surprisingly, differences in insulin content between T 1 DM islets, as well as, ′patchy′ or ′lobular′ destruction of islets have been described. These unique pathobiological phenomena, suggest that beta cell destruction {{may not always be}} inexorable and inevitably complete/total, and thus raise hopes for possible therapeutic interruption of beta cell autoimmunity - destruction and cure of {{type 1 diabetes}}. "Recurrent or secondary autoimmune insulitis" refers to the rapid reappearance of islet cell autoantibodies post pancreas transplant, and selective islet beta cell destruction in the grafted pancreas [never forgetting or "anamnestic" beta cell destructive memory], {{in the absence of any}} graft pancreas rejection [monozygotic twin to twin transplantation]. The one definite environmental factor is congenital rubella, because of which a subset of children subsequently develop type 1 diabetes. The putative predisposing factors are viruses, gluten and cow′s milk. The putative protective factors include gut flora, helminths, viral infections, and Vitamin D. Prevention of T 1 DM can include: Primary prevention strategies before the development of autoantibodies and Secondary prevention regimens after autoantibody development. Once islet cell autoantibodies have developed, the goal is to establish a therapeutic regimen to preserve at least 90 % of the beta cells, and prevent the development of hyperglycaemia. The targets for T 1 DM reversal should include autoimmunity, beta cell regeneration and protection of beta cell mass. Anti-CD 3 teplizumab and anti-CD 3 <b>otelixizumab</b> have been shown to provide C-peptide preservation. The unanswered questions in diabetes research include elimination of autoimmune memory responses, reestablishment of immune self-tolerance, and mechanisms of disease initiation...|$|E
