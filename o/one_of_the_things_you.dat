40|$|I {{propose a}} general {{promissory}} account of agreements {{according to which}} an agreement is an instance of joint intentional action, something the parties do together as a group. What agreement parties do together as a group is promise. Specifically, each party promises the other to do her part of the agreement, neither more nor less. Two promises count as a joint promise just when they {{can be said to}} interdepend in an explanatorily important way. The interdependence of agreement-promises is primarily a matter of the causal-motivational role each party’s belief about the relation between her own promise and that of the other plays in the giving of her own promise.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was {{the study of the}} cement-bone {{interface}} in the tibial component of a cemented total knee prosthesis. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> can see in specimens after in vivo service is that resorption of bone occurs in the interdigitated region between bone and cement. A stress shielding effect was investigated as a cause to explain bone resorption. Stress shielding occurs when bone is loaded less than physiological and therefore it starts remodeling according to the new loading conditions. µCT images were used to obtain 3 D models of the bone and cement structure and a Finite Element Analysis was used to simulate different kind of loads. Resorption was also simulated by performing erosion operations in the interdigitated bone region. Finally, 4 models were simulated: bone (trabecular), bone with cement, and two models of bone with cement after progressive erosions of the bone. Compression, tension and shear test were simulated for each model in displacement-control until 2 % of strain. The results show how the principal strain and Von Mises stress decrease after adding the cement on the structure and after the erosion operations. These results show that a stress shielding effect does occur and rises after resorption starts...|$|E
40|$|If {{you live}} {{anywhere}} near an AM broadcast band (BCB) station, {{then you might}} have serious reception problems, even with a high quality receiver. Although <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> get when you pay the premium price for a high quality receiver is superior overload protection, the signal from a local AM BCB station might overwhelm its defenses. In the USA we use the 530 - 1700 Khz medium wave AM BCB. Most stations operate with 1, 000 to 10, 000 watts of RF output power (although a few 250 to 500 watt local fizzlers also exist). A few stations are designated “clear channel ” stations, and operate with 50, 000 watts, 24 -hours a day. These stations (e. g. WSM Nashville, 650 Khz) are on frequencies that are not assigned to other stations for a distance of, I believe, 1300 miles radius. If you live within {{a few hundred yards}} of an AM BCB station, then it’s possible to see more than one volt of RF appearing at your receiver antenna terminals (a laboratory measured 4 volts in one case!). Given that your receiver likes to see signals in the dozens of microvolts level, then you can understand the problem. The Problem So what is the problem?

Our cover story this issue concerns straight pipes and the danger to {{public health and the environment}} they pose. Recognizing that threat and discussing it is one thing, but actually moving to eliminate it is another. The state of North Carolina has created a program to identify and eliminate straight pipes and failing septic systems on a watershed basis statewide (pg. 18). Even with the progress the program has made, it is estimated that it will take 10 to 15 years to get rid of all the straight pipes in the state. Unfortunately, it appears that North Carolina may be the only state that has a comprehensive, community-supported program in place to eliminate straight pipes (and other methods used to dispose of household wastewater without treating it). We are presenting their program as a model for other states. If there are any other programs like it in any other states, we at the NSFC would like to know about them. You can contact the editor of this magazine directly at the address on this page. Another program that we are showcasing in this issue i...|$|E
