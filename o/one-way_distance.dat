We find that telecommuters consistently live farther from work (in terms of time and distance) compared to former and future telecommuters. These longer <b>one-way</b> <b>distances</b> are ameliorated, however, by telecommuters traveling at higher speeds and commuting less frequently than their counterparts, with an end result of telecommuters commuting fewer person-miles and person-minutes, on average.

40|$|Seed cotton {{transport}} {{from the}} field to the gin is currently accomplished by building modules and hauling them with a module truck. Costs of module transport have not been characterized fully. Engineering economic analyses were performed to develop equations {{that are used to}} estimate the cost of module transport based on various assumptions. The use of a semi-tractor trailer (STT) for seed cotton transport is a possibility for reducing costs. Equations also were developed for modeling STT transport costs. Within 15 miles from a gin, the cost of seed cotton transport is $ 60 per module truck load and $ 90 per STT load. Outside of 15 miles, the transport costs increased linearly and more rapidly for STT than module truck costs. However, it was assumed that STT would haul 50 % more seed cotton per load. The transportation costs of stripper cotton were higher than picker cotton. Comparisons of the module truck versus STT system costs were made using geographic information system (GIS) software. An ArcGIS project was developed using gin location, production areas, highway and road system, and other items of interest.

30|$|Overall, {{all of the}} {{coefficients}} of the vignette dimensions exhibit the theoretically expected signs (cf. Sect.  4.2) and are statistically significant. Model  1 displays {{the coefficients}} of the vignette dimensions and the unemployment indicator. The monetary gains from accepting the job exert a highly significant and positive influence on the job acceptance of those individuals who are generally willing to accept job offers. The effect of weekly working hours on job offer acceptance is negative. This result is intuitive if we {{bear in mind that}} this coefficient is controlled by the other job characteristics, including the income gain. When presented with job offers that promise comparable income gains, respondents prefer those offers in which they can minimise their working hours. The signs for level of over-qualification and prospects of internal promotion are as expected. Although respondents seem to tolerate modest levels of over-qualification, over-qualification becomes a significant deterrent at higher levels, where the depreciation of human capital becomes an issue. Similarly, career prospects only become important for jobs that provide many opportunities for advancement. The duration of the employment contract is an important indicator of job security and was therefore included in both tiers. This dimension exerts a negative influence on the principal participation decision and the extent of job offer acceptance. As one would expect, contracts limited to one year {{are more likely to be}} rejected than contracts limited to three years. Central to our scenario of interregional mobility is the (<b>one-way)</b> <b>distance</b> between the place of residence and the new job. In particular, long distances that involve commuting times of four or six hours in one direction, which necessitate relocating the household, strongly reduce the likelihood of the acceptance of the offer, both in terms of the principal decision and the indication of the extent of acceptance. That there are only marginal differences between the four- and six-hour conditions supports the argument that it is the need to relocate rather than the actual distances that influences the willingness to accept job offers. Finally, the two dimensions that describe the labour and housing markets at the new place of residence are also important to the acceptance decision in intuitively expected ways. Better local employment opportunities, which act as a proxy for the risk in case of failure in the new job, foster acceptance, whereas harsher conditions in the local housing market, which represent a part of the relocation cost, deter acceptance.|$|E
40|$|Rapid rate of {{technology}} innovation and globalization have put substantial stress on integrating {{the technology and}} operations management, particularly the traditional automation technology and new climate technology. Mass customization and high product proliferation desires for automated and flexible manufacturing system. To achieve this, the automated flexible material handling system (MHS) must be deployed. In the automation technology management, we have proposed a modified cost estimation methodology to investigate the economic feasibility of a free-ranging MHS which is proposed by us in the apparel industry. Beacon placement {{plays a significant role}} in the free-ranging MHS in terms of cost and positioning performance. Traditionally, beacons are placed in a 2 dimensional array in the xy−plane above the target with an adaptive beacon height with the orientation perpendicularly to xy−plane, positioning reliability is incorporated to investigate the beacon placement strategies for three common placement patterns: triangle, square and hexagon. For beacons with small cone angle and applications with low beacon height, relaxing beacon orientation can earn significant advantages, therefore, the effect of relaxing beacon orientation by discrete clustering and continuous clustering is investigated to identify the optimal beacon placement strategies in terms of placement pattern and clustering pattern. Climate change is a fact, and has serious impact on the living of human being. Currently, there are two types of approaches to stabilize the climate change: mitigation of carbon emission and climate engineering. Since the high speed railway (H-SR) has proved potential in reducing transportation related carbon emission, we have designed the capacity and operating speed of the HSR system incorporating the carbon emission based on <b>one-way</b> <b>distance.</b> Taking the US for example, the carbon analysis is presented. Engineered manmade particles is promising with few side effects over sulfate aerosol. However, the practical deployment issue in terms of dispersion factor has yet to be addressed. We have identified the major factors determining the dispersion issue which is formulated by van der Waals adhesion energy, and then a holistic optimization model is proposed to identify the deployment strategies in terms of particle size, deployment height and dielectric material selection. Performance comparison has shown its advantage over the sulfate aerosol in terms of mass efficiency, number efficiency and dispersion factor. Furthermore, metallic particles and structure optimization are considered to improve the performance of the engineered manmade particles. From performance analysis, the aluminum manmade particle with shell structure proposed by us is the most promising in terms of mass efficiency and number efficiency...|$|E
30|$|Similarly to Arntz (2005 : 10), {{we define}} <b>one-way</b> <b>distances</b> {{requiring}} {{one hour of}} commuting as changes of job location that lie within normal commuting distances. Distances that require commuting of four or six hours we interpret as job locations that would necessitate a household relocation. With approximately two thirds of offers being beyond a daily commuting distance, the experimental setting facilitates a detailed study of the willingness to relocate based on {{a sufficient number of}} cases of unemployed individuals. The random allocation of vignettes to respondents ensures that all of the respondents are presented with comparable job offers. These methodological advantages of the experimental design help us examine the dynamics of the decision-making process with respect to the acceptance of interregional job offers. By focussing on stated behaviour, we avoid the selectivity bias associated with the observation of actual relocations while using a good predictor of individual mobility behaviour (Boenisch and Schneider 2010 : 489). If we find no (or a positive) correlation between the unemployment status and the acceptance of interregional job offers or at least find such a correlation after controlling for typical mobility costs, we conclude that unemployed persons are equally (or even more likely) than employed persons to relocate for comparable job opportunities. Regional disparities in unemployment rates and low migration rates of unemployed are then more likely {{to be the result of}} demand-side effects, i.e., employers being less likely to offer jobs to unemployed individuals from other regions or those offers not being noticed by the unemployed.|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} a waste {{collection}} system affects public health, the extent {{of participation in the}} system by residents, the recovery of resources from waste, and the cost of collection. Many developing countries use communal container collection [CCC] systems in which large containers are dispersed throughout neighbourhoods for the storage of waste until collection. These systems tend to have limited success as they often do not garner viable amounts of participation and containers are prone to being overfilled. The communal container waste collection system in the city of Aguascalientes, AGS, Mexico was assessed according to the Integrated Solid Waste Management [ISWM] principles of social acceptability, environmental effectiveness, economic affordability and effective management. Information was collected through seven interviews with waste-related managers, 282 residential questionnaires, and 12 informal collector questionnaires. The collection system garners a high participation rate (99 %) attributed to: non-burdensome <b>one-way</b> <b>distances</b> from residences to containers (mean 114 +/- 71 m); thorough, daily collection; and a culture of cleanliness. Factors of adherence to waste collection regulations were found to be public knowledge, social acceptability, convenience and perception of importance. The collection system was assessed by rational-intuitive consideration of all indicators and principles, to be mostly acceptable from an ISWM framework due to: a high collection rate (~ 100 % daily) which is enabled by effective monitoring and efficient operation; a high participation rate; similarity of the resource recovery rate to that of other developing and developed countries; and long-term affordability. Areas for improvement in equality of service provision, collaboration with informal collectors, and communication were identified.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 While {{there are}} many people who feel it is {{impossible}} to place a monetary value on a recreation resource, economists argue that not only is it possible to do so but also necessary because so many recreation sites are publicly provided. There have been various methods used to value non-market goods such as a recreation resource, but the methods being used today are still in a changing process. The objective of this thesis is to use and compare two of the most popular means of valuing a recreation site. The two methods are the contingent valuation method (direct questioning of willingness to pay) and the travel cost method. The site to be valued is Cullaby Lake County Park near Astoria, Oregon. Contingent valuation attempts to discover people's willingness to pay for use of the recreation site by "selling" annual passes for use of the site. Through summation of all individual's willingness to pay, a value for the recreation site is calculated. The travel cost method estimates a demand curve by asking users about their travel expenditures and assuming that people would react to an on-site price increase in the same manner as they would to an increase in travel expenditures. The demand curve estimated in this thesis divides users into distance zones and uses zone averages for all the variables. The dependent variable is visits per thousand population for each zone. The independent variables are travel costs (as a price proxy), income, and <b>one-way</b> <b>distance</b> traveled to the site (to represent travel time). The estimate of site value is derived through integration of the consumers' surplus area underneath the demand curve and above the price line. Value estimates derived by the two models show a wide divergence. The travel cost estimate is seven times larger than the contingent valuation estimate. Part of the reason for this discrepancy lies in the fact that the methods were estimating values for two different goods. A benefit estimate of a watershed development project on Cullaby Lake was desired. The contingent valuation method is flexible enough to allow estimation of the benefits attributable to only the improvements made on a natural lake. However, the travel cost model does not have this flexibility and will give a value for the lake as well as for the project improvements. While this thesis does not prove that one method is superior to the other, it may be an important contribution to the literature. Which model (if either) should be chosen to estimate recreation benefits may depend on exactly what it is that one is attempting to value...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the demand for and value of Oregon ocean sport-caught salmon fishery. The primary technique employed to estimate the recreational demand was an aggregated zone average travel cost method (TCM). The willingness of an angler to pay was deduced from the estimated demand for recreational fishing. The concept of consumers' surplus was used in conjunction with the travel-cost based demand functions to estimate the net economic value of Oregon ocean sport-caught salmon. The net economic value computed for the pooled data from all ten ports was found to be about 6. 4 million. This value was calculated based on the total travel cost per mile of <b>one-way</b> <b>distance</b> equal to 72 cents. The regional travel cost method (RTCM) was developed to measure the effects of substitutes and quality variables in the travel cost model. A system of a linear demand equations for the six larger ports was estimated by the seemingly unrelated regression equation (SURE) method. The substitute distances as proxies for substitute prices were found to be insignificant for this model. Likewise, attempts to include substitute distances using indexes constructed by the Principal Component analysis failed to give significant results, with the exception of Garibaldi and Brookings. The total net economic value for the regional travel cost model estimated by SURE was 9. 1 million. The incremental value per coho equivalent was also assessed by using the relationship between catch and effort per month by port. The coho equivalent was constructed on the basis of average weights of the commercial salmon catch, which was roughly two coho to one chinook salmon. The weighted average incremental value per coho and chinook was found to be 23. 46 and 43. 17, respectively. These values were about 50 percent of their respective average values. A total of 66 out of 234 distance zones created had zero values. Tobit analysis was employed to efficiently estimate the recreational demand from this kind of data. From the estimated demand function, a net economic value of about 12. 7 million was obtained. This value was higher than those estimated by the SURE method and the OLS in the simple model. It should be noted that all the above value estimates were based upon demand models that were not consistent with the theory of consumer demand. However, a theoretically consistent system of demand equations was estimated and presented in Appendix D. This model fitted the data better than the other models and should give more accurate estimates of consumer surplus...|$|E
40|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{was sent to}} more than 500 elderly (65 years or older) members of the Cycling Promotion in Sweden (Cykelfrämjandet) in June 2007. The foremost reason that elderly ride bicycles is to get exercise, which 94 % of the respondents state as a reason. Other often stated reasons are: because it is joyful (84 %), because it gives freedom (73 %), because it is easy (72 %) {{and because it is}} easy to park (66 %). The foremost reason that the elderly leave their bikes at home and use another means of transportation is bad road conditions during the winter, slipperiness (81 %), bad snow removal (79 %) and snowfall (77 %). Temperatures below zero Celsius restrain about half of the elderly from cycling. Also, long distances are a reason that elderly choose not to use a bike. Some leave their bikes at home when the distance in one direction is more than 6 - 10 kilometers. Two thirds (65 %) of the respondents do not like biking if the (<b>one-way)</b> <b>distance</b> is above 15 kilometers. Almost half of the respondents state that their bike usage would increase if there was a possibility to bring the bike onto busses and trains. The most commonly used equipment is lights, which are used by 81 % of the respondents. Most common are battery-powered lights followed by traditional dynamo-operated ones where the generator touches the tire. Some respondents have a dynamo in the hub. The second most common equipment is a helmet, which is used by 80 % of the elderly. The remaining fifth does not own one. About two thirds of the respondents use a bicycle-bag or basket and reflectors. Contrary, reflective vests are used only by 17 % of the respondents, but in rural areas the usage is close to 50 %. Rear-view mirrors are used by a few respondents, but are desired by quite many respondents (28 %). Winter tires and winter cycles are desired by one fifth of the respondents. However, {{more than half of the}} respondents stated that they do not miss any equipment or that they have no opinion. The most common sites or maneuvers the elderly avoid are roundabouts, left turns and crossing streets without a cycle crossing. Also cycle tracks with moped traffic are avoided by many. The most common reason that the elderly avoid any site or maneuver is that they feel insecure. Many choose to walk their bike, when they perceive something dangerous such as drivers of cars that do not stop or take cyclists into consideration and cars and mopeds that are driven too fast. However 41 % of the respondents do not avoid any site or maneuver. According to the elderly, the biggest safety problems are potholes, slipperiness and bad snow removal; 76, 74 and 70 % of the respondents have referred to these factors as safety problems. Major problems are also curb stones and cars going too fast. One third of the respondents state that signage and route information for bicyclists is good and another third that it is neither good nor bad. What the elderly say would increase their biking is linked to what they say is important for increased traffic safety. Increased safety would lead to increased biking among the elderly. Requests dealing with the physical design of roads are especially a demand for more and better cycle tracks. Communication between road users expressed as more and better consideration are also perceived to increase their feeling of security and thereby increase their biking.

40|$|The radius and {{diameter}} {{are fundamental}} graph parameters. They {{are defined as}} the minimum and maximum of the eccentricities in a graph, respectively, where the eccentricity of a vertex is the largest distance from the vertex to another node. In directed graphs, there are several versions of these problems. For instance, one may choose to define the eccentricity of a node {{in terms of the}} largest distance into the node, out of the node, the sum of the two directions (i. e. roundtrip) and so on. All versions of diameter and radius can be solved via solving all-pairs shortest paths (APSP), followed by a fast postprocessing step. Solving APSP, however, on n-node graphs requires Ω(n^ 2) time even in sparse graphs, as one needs to output n^ 2 distances. Motivated by known and new negative results on the impossibility of computing these measures exactly in general graphs in truly subquadratic time, under plausible assumptions, we search for approximation and fixed parameter subquadratic algorithms, and for reasons why they do not exist. Our results include: - Truly subquadratic approximation algorithms for most of the versions of Diameter and Radius with optimal approximation guarantees (given truly subquadratic time), under plausible assumptions. In particular, there is a 2 -approximation algorithm for directed Radius with <b>one-way</b> <b>distances</b> that runs in Õ(m√(n)) time, while a (2 -δ) -approximation algorithm in O(n^ 2 -ϵ) time is unlikely. - On graphs with treewidth k, we can solve the problems in 2 ^O(kk) n^ 1 +o(1) time.

40|$|Previous {{empirical}} studies have made {{contributions to the}} understanding of the impact of telecommuting on individual travel patterns. There has been much less research that has examined the impact of telecommuting on commute travel at the household level. Using data from the 2001 and 2009 US National Household Travel Surveys, this study focuses on one-worker and two-worker households and investigates how telecommuting affects household <b>one-way</b> commute <b>distance</b> and duration. The results show that telecommuting increases the commute distance and duration for both one-worker households and two-worker households. It is also found that, in two-worker households, the telecommuting status of one worker does not increase the commute distance and duration of the other worker. These findings suggest that telecommuting (two-worker) households tend to choose locations involving a longer total one-way commute than non-telecommuting households, and this difference is largely due to the longer commute of their telecommuting members. © 2013 Urban Studies Journal Limited.

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{a formal}} connection between physical {{problems related to}} entanglement detection and complexity classes in theoretical computer science. In particular, we show that to nearly every quantum interactive proof complexity class (including BQP, QMA, QMA(2), QSZK, and QIP), there corresponds a natural entanglement or correlation detection problem that is complete for that class. In this sense, {{we can say that}} an entanglement or correlation detection problem captures the expressive power of each quantum interactive proof complexity class. The only promise problem of this flavor that is not known to be complete for a quantum interactive proof complexity class is a variation of the original quantum separability problem in which the goal is to decide if a quantum state output by a quantum circuit is separable or entangled. We also show that the difficulty of entanglement detection depends on whether the distance measure used is the trace <b>distance</b> or the <b>one-way</b> LOCC <b>distance.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|A {{structured}} {{interview was}} used to collect data from 1579 passenger vehicle drivers over a 10 -week period. Approximately 11 % of these drivers were shift workers (SW) who had completed night shift and the balance were non-shift workers (NSW). The mean <b>one-way</b> driving <b>distance</b> was 211 km (SD= 84) and 213 (SD= 162) for SW and NSW respectively. The majority of SW (76 %) did not plan to take a driving break and some intended driving up to 600 km. SW reported taking approximately 6. 5 h of sleep {{the day before the}} drive compared to NSW who had a full nights sleep. Mean sleepiness ratings based on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) suggested SW were significantly more sleepy (M= 4. 64) than NSW (M= 2. 98). Approximately 19 % of SW were classified with severe sleepiness (KSS ≥ 7) compared to 1 % of NSW and this suggested SW had a greater incidence of safety relevant sleepiness. Severe sleepiness has been linked to driving impairments and is therefore, of concern {{for the safety of the}} individual and the wider community...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if there are distinct socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics among visitors based on distance traveled. The sample consisted of 642 visitors to the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Chi-Square tests showed that more distant visitors participated more in viewing activities, were more likely to be first time and day visitors, did less camping, and spent more money on activities, private lodging, and transportation than those traveling shorter <b>distances.</b> <b>One-way</b> ANOVA tests revealed that distant visitors had less place attachment with the destination, visited the destination less frequently, and spent longer periods away from home than close visitors...|$|R
2500|$|When {{the line}} {{connections}} were completed Graham Bell heard [...] "...explosive sounds, like {{the discharge of}} artillery.... mixed with a continuous crackling noise of an indescribable character". [...] Bell began to troubleshoot his device and after changing his telephone receiver's electromagnet from low to high resistance, voices suddenly emerged from the receiver [...] "clearly and strongly", on a telegraph line connection of some 106km (66 miles) length. [...] Speaking to his son in Paris from Brantford's Dominion Telegraph office, Professor Alexander Melville Bell sang songs, quoted Shakespeare and read poetry. In Paris, news of Bell's test quickly drew crowds of onlookers who witnessed Melville's voice emanating from the crude metal box. With only a telephone receiver Alexander Graham Bell could not respond directly to his father, and instead replied back by telegraph on a separate line to Brantford. Nevertheless Alexander Graham much later declared {{that this was the}} first <b>one-way</b> long <b>distance</b> call [...] "of several miles", but noted it was [...] "the first transmission at a distance, but it was not the first reciprocal conversation over a line. That was held in Boston on 9 October 1876." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{contingent}} valuation survey (willingness-to-pay study) {{was conducted in}} 2004 to measure household demand for typhoid vaccines in a rural township in China with approximately 54, 000 people living in 141 villages. The results showed that travel distance to vaccination sites and vaccination price affected the private demand for typhoid fever vaccinations. The number and location of vaccination outposts are thus important decision variables for a new vaccination campaign that is under consideration. This article develops and applies an optimization model for planning vaccination programs. The model determines what price to charge, how many vaccination outposts to use, where to locate them, and what capacities they need. The model uses demand information from the {{contingent valuation}} survey and cost information from similar vaccination campaigns in China and assumes that costs must be covered by user fees. The model determined {{that the number of}} outposts to use for maximizing coverage was fourteen, which would make average <b>one-way</b> travel <b>distance</b> for users about 0. 6 km. The optimal vaccination price was USD 1. 25, and about 87 percent of the population would be vaccinated. A suboptimal solution of the model showed that only 6 outposts instead of 14 would probably vaccinat...|$|R
40|$|In the Chinese {{character}} intelligent formation {{system without}} Chinese character library, {{it is possible}} that the same basic element in different Chinese characters is different in position, size and shape. The geometry transformation from basic elements to the components of Chinese characters can be realized by affine transformation, the transformation knowledge acquisition is the premise of Chinese character intelligent formation. A novel algorithm is proposed to ac-quire the affine transformation knowledge of basic elements automatically in this paper. The interested region of Chi-nese character image is determined by the structure of the Chinese character. Scale invariant and location invariant of basic element and Chinese character image are extracted with SIFT features, the matching points of the two images are determined according to the principle of Minimum Euclidean distance of eigenvectors. Using corner points as identifi-cation features, calculating the <b>one-way</b> Hausdorff <b>distance</b> between corner points as the similarity measurement from the affine image to the Chinese character sub-image, affine coefficients are determined by optimal similarity. 70244 Chinese characters in National Standards GB 18030 - 2005 character set are taken as the experimental object, all the characters are performed and the experimental courses and results are presented in this paper...|$|R
