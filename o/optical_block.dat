40|$|Development {{of laser}} systems {{designed}} {{to operate in}} conditions of the terrestrial atmosphere demands reliable information about the atmosphere condition. The aerosol lidars for operational monitoring of the atmosphere allow us to define remotely characteristics of atmospheric aerosol and cloudy formations in the atmosphere. Today the majority of aerosol lidars run in the visible range. However, in terms of safety (first of all to eyes) also ultra-violet (UF) range is of interest. A range of the wavelengths of the harmful effect on the eye retina is from 0. 38 to 1. 4 mμ. Laser radiation with the wavelengths less than 0. 38 mμ and over 1. 4 mμ influences the anterior ambient of an eye and is safer, than laser radiation with the wavelengths of 0. 38 – 1. 4 mμ. The paper describes a laser meter to measure characteristics of atmospheric inhomogeneity propertis in UF spectral range at the wavelength of 0. 355 mμ. As a radiation source, the meter uses a semiconductor-pumped pulse solid-state Nd:YAG laser. As a receiving lens, Kassegren's scheme-implemented mirror lens with a socket to connect optical fibre {{is used in the}} laser meter. Radiation from the receiving lens is transported through the optical fibre to the <b>optical</b> <b>block.</b> The <b>optical</b> <b>block</b> provides spectral selection of useful signal and conversion of optical radiation into electric signal. To ensure a possibility for alignment of the optical axes of receiving lens and laser radiator the lens is set on the alignment platform that enables changing lens inclination and turn with respect to the laser. The software of the laser meter model is developed in the NI LabVIEW 2012 graphic programming environment. The paper gives the following examples: a typical laser echo signal, which is back scattered by the atmosphere and spatiotemporal distribution of variation coefficient of the volumetric factor of the back scattered atmosphere.

40|$|A {{prototype}} variable supersaturation condensation particle sizer (VSCoPS) {{capable of}} measuring particle size distributions from 5 to 30 nm has been developed. This system design {{is adapted from}} existing condensation particle counter (CPC) technology with three significant differences: (1) the working fluid is a perfluorinated organic compound that is nonreactive toward, and not an effective solvent for, most laboratory or ambient particle compositions; (2) the vapor pressure of the working fluid is controlled by dilution of saturated air with vapor-free air at the same temperature; and (3) the <b>optical</b> <b>block</b> and condenser are located below the saturator, so that fluid condensed on the condenser walls does not flow back toward the saturator. By using fast-response flow controllers to vary the ratio of saturator and dilution air while keeping total flows and temperatures constant, the vapor saturation ratio in the condenser can be controlled with time constants of ∼ 1 s. The nucleation threshold diameter is changed by stepping through small increments in saturation ratio. The particle size distribution can be recovered by inverting the measured concentration using the known instrument response for each saturation ratio. Further development of the system may allow size distribution measurements to smaller particle diameters and scan times of < 30 s at total particle concentrations as low as ∼ 100 cm − 3...|$|E
40|$|Chinese Fengyun- 2 (FY- 2) {{satellite}} is {{to ensure}} continuity of atmospheric observation from the geostationary orbit (GEO) at the longitude of 105 E and 86. 5 E degrees {{as a part of}} the worldwide operational meteorological satellite system. FY- 2 C began to run operationally from March, 2005 until it was replaced by FY- 2 E on 25 November 2009. FY- 2 D and FY- 2 E are still operating on orbits and there will be more three members of FY- 2 satellite family in the near future, including FY- 2 F, FY- 2 G and FY- 2 H. FY- 2 spacecraft series has an on-board black body calibration mechanism, in which black bodies with known temperatures can be viewed. However, an absolute on-board calibration of the optical system is not possible, as part of the system consisting of the front optics is excluded from the calibration path. The current operational calibration of FY- 2 imager is mainly based on the inter-calibration using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and High-Resolution Infrared Radiometer Sounder (HIRS) onboard NOAA satellite. But this vicarious technique can not be conducted frequently and provide the diurnal variation when the instrument temperature has significant change in eclipse seasons. But the observation digital counts of the black bodies can respond directly to the diurnal variation of the ambient spacecraft temperature and sensor sensitivity. Black body calibrations may be used to tune the vicarious calibration. The latest FY- 2 E operational calibration began to be replaced using the Global Space-based Inter-Calibration System (GSICS) results based on AIRS and IASI instead of AVHRR and HIRS on January 19, 2012. It shows the great improvement of this operational calibration based on GSICS correction. The new bias is only smaller than 0. 2 K and the deviation is smaller than 0. 1 K except for eclipse seasons. We can also use this kind of GSICS correction for the FY- 2 historical data for climate ultilization and provide an independent calibration coefficient. But GSICS cannot resolve all the calibration issues of FY- 2 imagers for every time because of its limited collocated radiance in each day, especially GSICS meets difficulty in the completely diurnal cycle in eclipse phase. GSICS can provide the radiance reference in insolated time for FY- 2 observation and it can be combined into the onboard blackbody model development. The black body observation of FY- 2 is supplying a stable relative calibration data of all infrared channels frequently. The black body calibration sequence starts with a space view (hence mainly observing the self-emission of the front optical system) being taken, followed by a view of the black body itself. The viewing of the black bodies is performed by moving a mirror into the nominal optical path of the radiometer, between the <b>optical</b> <b>block</b> and the front optics. Therefore, the front optics of the radiometer is not included into the optical path of the black body calibration mechanism. In addition the viewing geometry is not similar for black body and Earth view. Hence, the pure black body calibration coefficients cannot be used directly for calibration of the infra red channels. The front optics model correcting for these issues is derived under the help of GSICS reference radiance in full optic. the front optics are not part of the optical path during a black body observation, and as the viewing geometry is different when performing a black body observation with respect to nominal Earth observation, a correction model has been designed allowing for these effects. The black body calibration gives a stable relative calibration of the infra red channels, while the tuning towards the GSICS calibration gives the absolute calibration level for both channels. Hence, the GSICS calibration of both infrared channels is used to tune the black body calibration for guaranteeing the absolute accuracy of calibration...|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss how}} all-optical signal {{processing}} might {{play a role}} in future all-optical packet switched networks. We introduce a concept of optical packet switches that employ entirely all-optical signal processing technology. The optical packet switch is made out of three functional blocks: the <b>optical</b> header processing <b>block,</b> the <b>optical</b> memory <b>block</b> and the wavelength conversion block. The operation principle of the optical packet switch is explained. We show that these three functional blocks can be realized by using the nonlinearities of semiconductor optical amplifiers. Some technologies in these three functional blocks are described. The header processor is realized using a Terahertz Optical Asymmetric Demultiplexer.

The semiconductor optical amplifier has a gain recovery timegreater than 90 ps, which corresponds to a less than 20 GHz bandwidth for conventional wavelength conversion.
