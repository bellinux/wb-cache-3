25|$|The Human Use of Human Beings {{is a book}} by Norbert Wiener, the {{founding}} thinker of cybernetics theory and an influential advocate of automation; it {{was first published in}} 1950 and revised in 1954. The text argues for the benefits of automation to society; it analyzes the meaning of productive communication and discusses ways for humans and machines to cooperate, with the potential to amplify human power and release people from the repetitive drudgery of manual labor, in favor of more creative pursuits in knowledge work and the arts. The risk that such changes might harm society (through dehumanization or subordination <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>species)</b> is explored, and suggestions are offered on how to avoid such risk.|$|E
25|$|The 21st {{century has}} {{witnessed}} a vigorous {{revival of the}} idea of human nature in the hands of authors like Edward Wilson, Steven Pinker and Jesús Mosterín. The successful sequencing of the human genome and the ongoing research on the function of genes and of regulatory sequences, together with the insights on the workings of the brain, have brought a new actuality and significance to this classical notion. According to Mosterín, the nature <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>species</b> Homo sapiens is the information genetically transmitted and present in the human genome (in the genetic pool). Your individual nature lies in your own genome, present in the chromosomes of your cells. The human genome has a layered structure and (up to a point) recapitulates the history of our human lineage. The oldest and deepest strata of our nature represent the living functions common to all life on Earth. Subsequent strata reflect later novelties. The newest layers are devoted to the most recent acquisitions, like bipedalism, grip of precision, large brain cortex, language and other abstract or recursive cognitive processes. Mosterín has dealt with the methods and criteria for distinguishing natural from cultural aspects of human capacities and behaviors and has provided a solid basis to theoretical anthropology. He has also engaged in the discussion and clarification of bioethical issues, like research with embryonic stem cells, birth control, abortion and euthanasia, taking always a scientific point of view and a position in favor of human freedom.|$|E

500|$|Ecology {{is as much}} a {{biological}} science as it is a human science. Human ecology is an interdisciplinary investigation into the ecology <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>species.</b> [...] "Human ecology may be defined: (1) from a bioecological standpoint as the study of man as the ecological dominant in plant and animal communities and systems; (2) from a bioecological standpoint as simply another animal affecting and being affected by his physical environment; and (3) as a human being, somehow different from animal life in general, interacting with physical and modified environments in a distinctive and creative way. A truly interdisciplinary human ecology will most likely address itself to all three." [...] The term was formally introduced in 1921, but many sociologists, geographers, psychologists, and other disciplines were interested in human relations to natural systems centuries prior, especially in the late 19th century.|$|E

2500|$|The {{purpose and}} content of a {{response}} is also an issue that PDPs seek to make explicit. There is considerable disagreement {{as to how to}} effectively communicate meaning and intent across what would likely be formidable language barriers. The message would need to be crafted {{in such a way that}} its content and delivery were unambiguous to receivers that may not even use written or verbal communication. Several mathematic, pictorial, algorithmic, and [...] "natural" [...] language theories have been developed and applied to the problem of CETI. A specific purpose or goal of outgoing transmissions may be covered by a PDP as well. Several possible functions exist, including: a description <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>species</b> and planet, a request for information, and/or the proposition of some course of action. However, in the absence of an intergovernmental agreement or structures for building consensus on the subject, nations, groups, and individuals are free to act autonomously. It is precisely because the process of sculpting a collective message would be slow and laborious (but intensely important), that most scientists recommend having a PDP with some prescribed action laid out before contact is made.|$|E
2500|$|Georgescu takes {{a dismal}} {{view on the}} future of mankind. On the one hand, his general {{argument}} is that the carrying capacity of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is decreasing as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use; but on the other hand, he finds that restraining ourselves collectively on a permanent and voluntary basis for the supposed benefit of unknown future generations is running counter to our biological nature as a species considered: We cannot help ourselves. Consequently, the world economy will continue growing until its inevitable and final collapse in the future. From that point on, ever deepening scarcities will cause widespread misery, aggravate social conflict throughout the globe, and intensify man's economic struggle to work and earn a livelihood. A prolonged 'biological spasm' <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>species</b> will follow, ultimately spelling the end of mankind itself, as man has now become completely and irreversibly dependent on the industrial economy for his biological existence.

2500|$|At the UN World Conference against Racism 2001, {{when the}} issue of {{compensation}} for colonialism and slavery arose in the agenda, President Fidel Castro of Cuba advocated the Tobin Tax to address that issue.

Castro cited holocaust reparations as a previously established precedent for the concept of reparations. Castro also suggested that the United Nations be the administrator of this tax, stating the following:May the tax suggested by Nobel Prize Laureate James Tobin be imposed in a reasonable and effective way on the current speculative operations accounting for trillions of US dollars every 24 hours, then the United Nations, which cannot go on depending on meager, inadequate, and belated donations and charities, will have one trillion US dollars annually to save and develop the world.

2500|$|McKenna saw the universe, in {{relation}} to Novelty theory, as having a teleological attractor {{at the end of}} time, which increases interconnectedness and would eventually reach a singularity of infinite complexity. He also frequently referred to this as [...] "the transcendental object at the end of time." [...] When describing this model of the universe he stated that: [...] "The universe is not being pushed from behind. The universe is being pulled from the future toward a goal that is as inevitable as a marble reaching the bottom of a bowl when you release it up near the rim. If you do that, you know the marble will roll {{down the side of the}} bowl, down, down, down – until eventually it comes to rest at the lowest energy state, which is the bottom of the bowl. That's precisely my model of human history. I'm suggesting that the universe is pulled toward a complex attractor that exists ahead of us in time, and that our ever-accelerating speed through the phenomenal world of connectivity and novelty is based on the fact that we are now very, very close to the attractor." [...] Therefore, according to McKenna's final interpretation of the data and positioning of the graph, on December 21, 2012 we would have been in the unique position in time where maximum novelty would be experienced. An event he described as a [...] "concrescence", a [...] "tightening 'gyre'" [...] with everything flowing together.
