40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, Nancy Fraser has {{developed}} a sophisticated theory of social justice. At its heart lies the principle of parity of participation, according to which all adult members of society must {{be in a position}} to interact with one another as peers. This article examines some obstacles to the implementation of that principle. Concentrating on the contemporary <b>status</b> <b>order,</b> it asks two specific questions. Is it possible to produce a precise account of how the <b>status</b> <b>order</b> might need to be ordered for parity of participation to be realized? And is it possible to derive a detailed and coherent political strategy capable of achieving such parity within the <b>status</b> <b>order?</b> The argument of is that, while Fraser has recognized the difficulties that the complexity of the contemporary <b>status</b> <b>order</b> poses for achieving parity of participation, she has nevertheless underestimated those difficulties. If parity of participation requires status equality, important and difficult work remains to be done in delineating the nature, and demands, of equality in the contemporary <b>status</b> <b>order...</b>|$|R

The papers, however, relate closely to one another and are thus able to proffer a variety of comparative reflections...|$|R
