40|$|The concept <b>of</b> {{spanwise}} <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> blowing, a {{means of}} controlling the position and strength <b>of</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> vortices, is analyzed by numerical solutions of the three-dimensional Thin-Layer Navier Stokes equations. The <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> jet is simulated by defining a permeable boundary, corresponding to the jet slot, where suitable boundary conditions are implemented. Numerical results agree favorably with experimental measurements. It is found that the use <b>of</b> spanwise <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> blowing not only magnifies the size and strength <b>of</b> the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> vortices, but also moves the vortex cores outboard and upward. As a result, the increase in lift comes primarily from the greater nonlinear vortex lift. The presence <b>of</b> the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> jet stream displaces the flow outboard, thereby increasing the effective aspect ratio of the delta wing. However, blowing causes earlier vortex breakdown, thus decreasing the stall angle...|$|R

40|$|Cyclical {{activation}} and inactivation of Rho family small G proteins, such as Rho, Rac, and Cdc 42, {{are needed}} for moving cells to form <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> structures in response to chemoattractants. However, the mechanisms underlying the dynamic regulation of their activities are not fully understood. We recently showed that another small G protein, Rap 1, {{plays a crucial role}} in the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) -induced formation <b>of</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> structures and activation of Rac 1 in NIH 3 T 3 cells. We showed here that knockdown of afadin, an actin-binding protein, in NIH 3 T 3 cells resulted in a failure to develop <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> structures in association with an impairment of the activation of Rap 1 and Rac 1 and inactivation of RhoA in response to PDGF. Overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of Rap 1 (Rap 1 -CA) and knockdown of SPA- 1, a Rap 1 GTPase-activating protein that was negatively regulated by afadin by virtue of binding to it, in afadin-knockdown NIH 3 T 3 cells restored the formation <b>of</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> structures and the reduction of the PDGF-induced activation of Rac 1 and inactivation of RhoA, suggesting that the inactivation of Rap 1 by SPA- 1 is responsible for inhibition of the formation <b>of</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> structures. The effect of Rap 1 -CA on the restoration of the formation <b>of</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> structures and RhoA inactivation was diminished by additional knockdown of ARAP 1, a Rap-activated Rho GAP, which localized at the <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> moving NIH 3 T 3 cells.

40|$|Abstract Background 2, 3 -Butanedione monoxime (BDM) {{has been}} widely used as a non-muscle myosin {{inhibitor}} to investigate the role of non-muscle myosinII {{in the process of}} actin retrograde flow and other actin cytoskeletal processes. Recent reports show that BDM does not inhibit any non-muscle myosins so far tested, including nm-myosinII, prompting the question, how were these process affected in BDM studies? Results We have found that treatment of mammalian cells with BDM for only 1 min blocks actin incorporation at the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> in a permeabilized cell system. We show that inhibition of actin incorporation occurs through de-localization <b>of</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> proteins involved in actin polymerization – the Arp 2 / 3 complex, WAVE, and VASP – that de-localize concomitantly with the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> actin network. Conclusion De-localization <b>of</b> actin <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> components by BDM treatment is a newly described effect of this compound. It may explain many of the results previously ascribed to inhibition of non-muscle myosinII by BDM, particularly in studies <b>of</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> dynamics. Though this effect of BDM is intriguing, future studies probing actin dynamics at the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> should use more potent and specific inhibitors. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{was determined}} of incorporating the Navier-Stokes computational code, CFL 3 D, into the supersonic wing design process. The approach taken is of two steps. The {{first step was}} to calibrate CFL 3 D against existing experimental data sets obtained on thin sharp edged delta wings. The experimental data identified six flow types which are dependent on the similarity parameters of Mach number and angle of attack normal to the <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> The calibration showed CFL 3 D capable of simulating these various separated and attached flow conditions. The second step was to use CFL 3 D to study the initial formation <b>of</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> separation over delta wings at supersonic speeds. This consisted of examining solutions obtained on a 65 deg delta wing at Mach number of 1. 6 with varying cross sectional shapes. Reynolds number was held constant at 1000000 and the Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model was used. The study showed that through the use <b>of</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> radius and/or camber, the onset <b>of</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> separation can be delayed to a higher angle of attack than observed on a flat sharp edged wing.
