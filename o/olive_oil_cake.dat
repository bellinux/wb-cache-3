40|$|In {{this study}} {{solid and liquid}} wastes from the olive oil {{processing}} industry were evaluated as substrates for Yarrowia lipolytica growth {{with the aim of}} lipase production. Olive mill wastewater and <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> seemed to provide necessary nutrients and physical support for the yeast to grow and produce enzyme. The highest lipolytic activity of 850 IU dm- 3 was achieved after 4 days of submerged cultivation in supplemented olive mill wastewater. In addition, <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> appeared to be a convenient substrate for lipase production under solid state fermentation mode. Lipase production was further improved by media supplementation and/or change in physical settings of the experiment. However, the most significant improvement of lipase production under solid state fermentation was achieved by an alkaline treatment of the substrate (more than 10 -fold) when the amount of produced lipase reached up to ~ 40 IU g- 1 of substrate.

The feed conversion of the olive seed cake supplement (kg supplement/kg gain) was lower (P < 0. 01) than that of the maize-based supplement. Despite some significant differences between carcasses traits, all were small and of little commercial consequence. Simulation modelling of whole-system performance suggested that early weaning of lambs followed by concentrate feeding would reduce the finishing period, marginally increase the liveweight of ewes and would have little effect on pasture availability.

30|$|EEC Regulation 2568 / 91 [1] and International Olive Council (IOC) [2] have {{established}} both analytical and organoleptic criteria {{to define the}} quality grade of an <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> According {{to the results of}} chemical and sensory analyses, an <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> can be classified as extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (EVOO), virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> or lampante <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> Each category has a completely different commercial and nutritional value. Extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (EVOO) is a natural fruit juice with peculiar nutritional, healthy [3] and sensory [4] qualities as well as it represents a fundamental component of Mediterranean diet which is very rich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids [5] and polyphenols [6].

However, another important aspect to consider is that the downgrading of an EVOO to a lower category implies a big economic loss for the producers. So, it is fundamental that both the chemical analyses and the organoleptic evaluations used to define quality grade are “sufficiently” objective and reproducible.|$|R

Positive and significant correlation was obtained between weather parameters and population of fungi. Key words: <b>Oil</b> <b>cakes,</b> fungal deterioration. <b>Oil</b> <b>cakes</b> are traditionally and widely used as manure and are the major constituents of cattle and poultry feed. Deterioration by microorganisms {{is a serious problem}} encountered in the storage and trans-port of <b>oil</b> <b>cakes.</b> Fungi are the major group respon-sible for the spoilage of <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> (philip, 1978;Nusrath and Nahdi, 1983 and Reddy et al., 1986).
