5|$|A world {{containing}} {{creatures who}} are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't cause or determine {{them to do}} only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not {{do what is right}} freely. To create creatures capable <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> good, therefore, He must create creatures capable <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil {{and at the same time}} prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> evil only by removing the possibility <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> good.|$|E
5|$|The six stages <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> {{development}} are grouped into three levels: pre-conventional morality, conventional morality, and post-conventional morality.|$|E
5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} stage <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing {{the limitations of the}} current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E

50|$|An Enquiry Concerning the Principles <b>of</b> <b>Morals</b> (EPM) {{is a book}} by Scottish {{enlightenment}} philosopher David Hume. In it, Hume argues (among other things) {{that the}} foundations <b>of</b> <b>morals</b> lie with sentiment, not reason.|$|R

5|$|For his studies, Kohlberg {{relied on}} stories {{such as the}} Heinz dilemma, and was {{interested}} in how individuals would justify their actions if placed in similar moral dilemmas. He then analyzed the form <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> reasoning displayed, rather than its conclusion, and classified it as belonging to one of six distinct stages.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg's theory {{centers on}} the notion that justice is the {{essential}} characteristic <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> reasoning. Justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology and eudaimonia.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence Kohlberg's stages <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> {{development}} {{constitute an}} adaptation of a psychological theory originally conceived by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget.

50|$|The Metaphysics <b>of</b> <b>Morals</b> (Die Metaphysik der Sitten) is a 1797 work <b>of</b> {{political}} and <b>moral</b> philosophy by Immanuel Kant.|$|R
50|$|In the English-speaking world, The Metaphysics <b>of</b> <b>Morals</b> {{is not as}} {{well known}} as Kant's earlier works, the Groundwork of the Metaphysics <b>of</b> <b>Morals</b> and the Critique of Practical Reason, but it {{experienced}} a renaissance {{in the last few}} decades through the pioneering work of Gregor.|$|R
5|$|The {{conventional}} level <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> {{reasoning is}} typical of adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of {{the third and fourth}} stages <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.|$|E
5|$|The pre-conventional level <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> {{reasoning}} is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit {{this level of}} reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists {{of the first and}} second stages <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.|$|E
5|$|Accounting {{ethics is}} {{primarily}} a field of applied ethics and is part of business ethics and human ethics, the study <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> values and judgments as they apply to accountancy. It {{is an example of}} professional ethics. Accounting introduced by Luca Pacioli, and later expanded by government groups, professional organizations, and independent companies. Ethics are taught in accounting courses at higher education institutions as well as by companies training accountants and auditors.|$|E

5|$|Flanders had {{a strict}} Congregationalist {{religious}} beginning, which evolved with his experience into {{a belief in}} “moral law.” He felt that “recognition <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> law {{is as much a}} necessary requirement of social achievement as physical law is of material advancement.” In Flanders’s view, moral law required honesty, compassion, responsibility, cooperation, humility, and wisdom—values that all cultures hold in common. For him it was an absolute standard. He spoke of a “Presence” or “daimon” that “renewed his courage” and “indicated direction” in everything he did.|$|E

5|$|One {{criticism}} of Kohlberg's {{theory is that}} it emphasizes justice {{to the exclusion of}} other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric. Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely {{to move on to the}} abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> reasoning based on the ethics of caring. Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.|$|E

5|$|One {{objection}} is that two-level utilitarianism undermines an agent's {{commitment to}} act in accordance {{with his or her}} moral principles. For example, a theist will comply with his/her moral code because he/she sees it as based upon God's will. However, a two-level utilitarian knows that his everyday set <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> rules is merely a guideline, and as such any breach of these rules is unlikely to accompany the same degree of guilt as would someone who believed that it was wrong in principle {{to act in}} that way.|$|E
