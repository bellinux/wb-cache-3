40|$|Abstract. Sudden {{unilateral}} blindness {{occurred in}} a 7 -year-old grey gelding Quarterhorse. Ophthalmoscopy revealed a pigmented mass arising from the nasal ciliary body of the right eye and extending around the posterior surface of the lens, and there were pigmented particles in the vitreous. Examination of the enucleated globe showed a circumscribed, black, dense and symmetrically ovoid mass with sessile attachment to the nasal ciliary region and extension to posterior lens capsule, vitreous and along the vitreal face of the detached retina to the <b>optic</b> <b>papilla.</b> The mass was composed of heavily pigmented, plump, polyhedral cells that invaded the vitreous and the inner limiting membrane of peripapillary retina and <b>optic</b> <b>papilla.</b> It {{was considered to be}} a primary, malignant, intraocular melanoma arising from a large uveal nevus.

This study described the clinical characteristics and visual outcome of 193 patients with ocular toxoplasmosis at Feiz Hospital (Isfahan, Iran) during the last six years. The setting and design used was a retrospective non-comparative observational case series. In this study, 193 patients with ocular toxoplasmosis (111 female, 82 male) were enrolled. The distribution of symptoms and fundoscopic findings were studied. The most-reported chief complaint was blurred vision in 96 (184 patients) and floaters in 13. 47 (25 patients) of cases and most frequent clinical manifestations were chorioretinitis 98. 48 (190 patients), macular scars 50. 7 (98 patients), and atrophic <b>optic</b> <b>papilla</b> two (1. 03) patients. Primary retinal lesions were observed in 16 (8. 2) and combination of active lesions and old retinochoroidal scars in 177 (91. 7) of the patients. Retinal detachment occurred in 11 (5. 69) patients. Bilateral involvement was found in 27 of patients. Blindness was 0. 05 after treatment. Recurrence rate was 14. 5.

5000|$|In adult humans, {{the entire}} retina is {{approximately}} 72% of a sphere about 22 mm in diameter. The entire retina contains about 7 million cones and 75 to 150 million rods. The optic disc, {{a part of}} the retina sometimes called [...] "the blind spot" [...] because it lacks photoreceptors, is located at the <b>optic</b> <b>papilla,</b> a nasal zone where the optic-nerve fibres leave the eye. It appears as an oval white area of 3mm². Temporal (in the direction of the temples) to this disc is the macula. At its centre is the fovea, a pit that is responsible for our sharp central vision but is actually less sensitive to light because of its lack of rods. Human and non-human primates possess one fovea as opposed to certain bird species such as hawks who actually are bifoviate and dogs and cats who possess no fovea but a central band known as the visual streak. Around the fovea extends the central retina for about 6 mm and then the peripheral retina. The edge of the retina is defined by the ora serrata. The length from one ora to the other (or macula), the most sensitive area along the horizontal meridian is about 32 mm.|$|R
40|$|In certain {{species of}} teleost fish, the retinal cone photoreceptors are {{tangentially}} positioned in mosaic patterns. It {{is possible that}} this mosaic arrangement is fixed. However, in recent years, {{it has been reported}} that these patterns may change in ways that depend on the light environment and on circadian rhythms. Given these notions, the degree of plasticity in the cone row arrangement has been an unresolved issue. We investigated whether or not the pattern of cone distribution changes with the photic environment. For this purpose, we used the retina of dace (Tribolodon hakonensis), to take advantage of its the ventral retina, a regular radial row mosaic pattern centering around the <b>optic</b> <b>papilla</b> was observed. A change in this pattern due to the light environment was not observed. Different results were obtained in the central and dorsal areas of the retina: while a row mosaic pattern was not observed under dark adaptation, a short row mosaic arrangement formed in the dorsal retina under light adaptation. In area of the retina that lack regular mosaic pattern, triple cones and quadruple cones are abundant. Since a triple cone consists of 1 red-sensitive cone and 2 green-sensitive cones, and a quadruple cone consists of 1 red-sensitive cone and 3 green-sensitive cones, the distribution density of green-sensitive cones may be considered high in the central area of the retina. It is suggested that the transmission of color information differs in different regions across the retina...|$|R

40|$|PurposeChanges in {{optic nerve}} {{reflectance}} {{in response to}} visual stimulation have been demonstrated in the visible wavelengths (Crittin and Riva, 2004) and in presence of flash stimulation in monkeys (Hanazono et al., IOVS 2007). The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine whether diffuse flicker-induced reflectance changes in the human optic nerve could be detected using near-infrared light. MethodsSix 770 -nm reflectance measurements were carried out on a healthy, informed and consenting volunteer, by means of a PC-controlled ocular fundus reflectometer based on a commercial fundus camera and modified for the purpose of the study. Neural activity was evoked by 535 -nm diffuse square wave flicker stimulation at 12 Hz. The measurement protocol consisted of 6 successive reflectance registrations at 770 nm, each consisting of a 20 s baseline followed by 60 s flicker. We investigated two different measuring sites in the <b>optic</b> nerve <b>papilla</b> deprived of visible vessels, near the temporal rim. The reflectance changes measured in a control region outside the optic nerve were subtracted from the reflectance variations obtained from the two investigation sites, to cancel out the effects of involuntary eye and head movements. ResultsFlicker induced a significant decrease in near-infrared reflectance, which reached a maximum value at approximately 60 s of stimulation. The decrease with respect to control amounted to - 2. 6 % {+/-} 1. 4 % (mean {+/-} 1 standard error) for measuring site 1 and - 2. 4 % {+/-} 1. 4 % for measuring site 2.

40|$|The {{relative}} importance of vision in a foveate group of alepocephalid teleosts is examined {{in the context of}} a deep-sea habitat beyond the penetration limits of sunlight. The large eyes of Conocara spp. possess deep convexiclivate foveae lined with Müller cells comprising radial shafts of intermediate filaments and horizontal processes. Photoreceptor cell (171. 8 x 10 (3) rods mm(- 2)) and retinal ganglion cell (11. 9 x 10 (3) cells mm(- 2)) densities peak within the foveal clivus and the perifloveal slopes, respectively, with a centro-peripheral gradient between 3 : 1 (photoreceptors) and over 20 : 1 (ganglion cells). The marked increase in retinal sampling localized in temporal retina, coupled with a high summation ratio (13 : 1), suggest that foveal vision optimizes both spatial resolving power and sensitivity in the binocular frontal visual field. The elongated optic nerve head is comprised of over 500 <b>optic</b> <b>papillae,</b> which join at the embryonic fissure to form a thin nervous sheet behind the eye. The optic nerve is divided into two axonal bundles; one receiving input from the fovea (only unmyelinated axons) and the other from non-specialized retinal regions (25 % of axons are myelinated), both of which appear to be separated as they reach the visual centres of the central nervous system. Comparison of the number of primary (first-order) axonal pathways for the visual (a total of 63. 4 x 10 (6) rod photoreceptors) and olfactory (a total of 15. 24 x 10 (3) olfactory nerve axons) inputs shows a marked visual bias (ratio of 41 : 1). Coupled with the relative size of the optic tecta (44. 0 mm 3) and olfactory bulbs (0. 9 mm 3), vision appears to play a major role in the survival of these deep-sea teleosts and emphasizes that ecological and behavioural strategies account for significant variation in sensory brain structure...|$|R

Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to report a patient with angioid streaks in whom subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) developed after blunt ocular trauma. Case report: A 60 -year-old man was accidentally struck in the left eye with a crowbar handle while engaged in the demolition of wooden building materials in May 2011 and was initially evaluated at our hospital. Corrected visual acuity was 0. 3 in the right and 1. 2 in the left eye, and relative afferent pupillary defect was negative. Funduscopy revealed choroidal atrophy around the <b>optic</b> <b>papillae</b> and angioid streaks radiating from around the optic discs in both eyes. In the right eye, there was macular atrophy. In the left eye, there was a subretinal hemorrhage around the macular region. Fluorescein angiography of the left eye showed a blockage due to subretinal hemorrhage and increasing hyperfluorescent spots superior to the fovea, suggestive of extrafoveal CNV. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography showed macular thinning in the right eye and no obvious abnormalities near the subfoveal region in the left eye. Two months later, the patient noticed decreased visual acuity in the left eye and was reevaluated. Visual acuity had decreased to 0. 7, and well-defined CNV, one disc diameter in size, was presenting slightly superior to the macula, including the subfoveal region. Two weeks later, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) antibody (bevacizumab) was injected intravitreally; the CNV then regressed, and visual acuity improved to 1. 2. Conclusion: Marked improvement in visual acuity with early treatment has not been reported in angioid streaks with subfoveal CNV after ocular injury. Intravitreal injection of an anti-VEGF antibody should be considered early after the diagnosis of CNV. Keywords: pseudoxanthoma elasticum, subretinal hemorrhage, anti-VEGF therap...|$|R

Main emphasis in this case was laid on the examination of possible influencing variables as well as the setting of a diagnostic limit by means of the investigated quality criterions. Patients & Methods: A total number of 509 children were examined under the clinical suspicion of IICP. Therefore, the optic nerve was depicted through the closed eye in an axial cut by B-mode sonography and measured at its widest point. The nerve sheath and the <b>optic</b> nerve <b>papilla</b> were also evaluated. Results: Out of 483 evalued examinations, IICP was excluded for 466 children; the mean optic nerve diameter in this group was 3. 4 mm ± 0, 5 mm. For 17 children with proven IICP the mean diameter of the optic nerve was 5. 6 mm ± 0. 9 mm. Significant correlation between various influencing variables could not be found. For a limit of the optic nerve diameter set at 4. 5 mm, the sensitivity was 94. 1 %; the specifity 93. 1 %. Conclusion: Sonography of the optic nerve is a simple and uncomplicated method for the diagnosis of IICP; however, it cannot achieve final diagnostic certainty.

40|$|Linear IgA bullous {{dermatosis}} and {{dermatitis herpetiformis}} are inflammatory subepidermal blistering diseases characterized by IgA deposits at the cutaneous epithelial basement membrane and in dermal <b>papillae,</b> respectively. <b>Inflammation</b> in both disorders localizes to sites of IgA deposition and {{is characterized by}} a predominance of neutrophils. From these observations we postulate that IgA deposits in both diseases may contribute to the recruitment and/or localization of neutrophils. In this study we examined the ability of in vitro and in vivo bound IgA anti-basement membrane autoantibodies from patients with linear IgA builbus dermatosis and in vivo bound IgA deposits in dermal papillae from patients with dermatitis herpetiformis to mediate adherence of neutrophils stimulated by granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The study showed that stimulated neutrophils adhered to basement membranes and dermal papillae containing IgA deposits. Adherence was IgA anti-basement membrane antibody concentration dependent and correlated with the immunofluorescence staining intensity of IgA deposits in dermal papillae. Adherence to IgA deposits but not IgG deposits could be inhibited by purified exogenous secretory IgA but not IgG and adherence to IgG deposits could be inhibited by purified exogenous IgG but not secretory IgA. These results provide direct experimental evidence that cutaneous IgA deposits in linear IgA bullous dermatosis and dermatitis herpetiformis can function as ligands for neutrophil adherence and have a role in the localization of inflammation in these disorders...|$|R

40|$|Primary {{glaucoma}} is {{a chronic}} disease causing blindness in approximately 10 millions people worldwide every year. The discrepancy between intraocular pressure (IOP) and perfusion of the <b>optic</b> nerve <b>papilla</b> leads to specific increasing damage {{of the visual}} field. Therapeutic target is IOL lowering by application of eyedrops or by glaucoma surgery. Therapeutic failures or complications are possible. Therefore alternative procedures with good effects and uncomplicated applications are still needed. This experimental study investigates the potential efficacy of an excimer laser applicated for glaucoma surgery. Material and Methods: Ablation characteristics and temperature expansion of an 308 -nm-excimer laser (model EMG 102, Lamda-Physik) in human scleral tissue were investigated. 15 different energy densities (600 - 2700 mJ/cm 2), five treatments for each, were applied with the laser {{to the point of}} perforation of the scleral tissue. The number of needed pulses was documented. In another experimental series constant energy density of 1600 mJ/cm 2 was applied in different distances (2500 - 100 µm in steps of 300 µm) and temperature development in the scleral tissue was measured. Additionally the practicability of the laser application was tested in an animal experiment (in vivo application on a rabbit in Ketanest®-anesthesia). All treated scleral tissue samples were histologicly processed and analyzed for thermal damages. Results: Three phases of the ablation were seen. Up to a level of 600 - 700 mJ/cm 2 of energy densitiy the time to scleral perforation was up to 110 seconds accompanied by a considerable drying of the tissue. With energy densities of 800 - 1100 mJ/cm 2 time of exposure was 11 to 30 seconds, also accompanied by thermal damage. With energy levels of 1200 mJ/cm 2 and more ablation rate increased and the duration of time till perforation was only few seconds. With energy densities less than 1200 mJ/cm 2 necrotic zones measured 150 - 200 µm, with higher energy levels they measured 50 - 100 µm. The animal experiment demonstrated practicability of the laser application in principle, although broadened damage zones were seen in the histologic samples. Conclusion: The experimental series demonstrate a general practicability of a fistulating glaucoma surgery ab-interno with the 308 -nm-excimer laser. However thermal damages are shown which may lead to scleral scarring and an occlusion of the fistula. The endowment of the sclera with sulfonamids might decrease thermal damage.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} transient high perfusion pressure on the retinal vessel diameter and retinal ganglion cells. METHODS: The animals were divided into four groups according to different infusion pressure and infusion time (60 mm Hg- 3 min, 60 mm Hg- 5 min, 100 mm Hg- 3 min, 100 mm Hg- 5 min). Each group consisted of six rabbits. The left eye {{was used as the}} experimental eye and the right as a control. Retinal vascular diameters were evaluated before, during infusion, immediately after infusion, 5 min, 10 min and 30 min after infusion based on the fundus photographs. Blood pressure was monitored during infusion. The eyes were removed after 24 h. Damage to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) was analyzed by histology. RESULTS: Retina became whiten and <b>papilla</b> <b>optic</b> was pale during perfusion. Measurements showed signiﬁcant decrease in retinal artery and vein diameter during perfusion in all of the four groups at the proximal of the edge of the optic disc. The changes were significant in the 100 mm Hg- 3 min group and 100 mm Hg- 5 min group compared with 60 mm Hg- 3 min group (P 1 = 0. 025, P 2 = 0. 000). The diameters in all the groups recovered completely after 30 min of reperfusion. The number of RGC showed no signiﬁcant changes at the IOP in 100 mm Hg with 5 min compared with contralateral untreated eye (P ＞ 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Transient fluctuations during infusion lead to temporal changes of retinal vessels, which could affect the retinal blood circulation. The RGCs were not affected by this transient fluctuation. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the effect of pressure during real-time phacoemusification on retinal blood circulation...|$|R
40|$|Background Skin {{hydration}} {{is defined}} as the water content of the epidermis and the dermis. In vivo reflectance confocal microscopy offers the opportunity to determine in vivo the kinetics of the skin after the application of topical products. Objective To define confocal features associated with dry skin and assess the microscopic effects of different moisturizers. Methods Ten healthy volunteers were enrolled for the study. Two different formulations were tested: petrolatum and a commercially available emulsion. Measurements were performed from baseline to 3 h after removal of the occlusion at regular time points. Nine confocal features were assessed: furrows' size, overall interkeratinocyte reflectance, furrows' morphology, scales, skin surface irregularity, non-rimmed dermal <b>papillae,</b> exocytosis, dermal <b>inflammation</b> and collagen type. Furrows' size and interkeratinocyte reflectance were also quantitated using a digital analysis. Stratum corneum capacitance was recorded. Results At baseline, RCM showed the presence of micro-scales and high skin surface irregularity score. After the application of topical products, the scale score decreased significantly; Furrow's size and Digital Furrow's Size had a marked and directly correlated decrement. Furrow's morphology and Epidermal Irregularity scores decreased from baseline to 30 min, the latter reaching a plateau in product application areas. Interestingly, interkeratinocyte reflectance progressively increased with the application of the topical products, while remained stable in the control area, confirmed by Digital Interkeratinocytes reflectance quantitation. Conclusion RCM revealed that the changes involve the skin surface by reducing the micro-scales and epidermal irregularity. Even more interestingly, RCM showed that higher interkeratinocytes' brightness is seen for moisturizer, but not for the control area. This RCM finding could be linked to keratinocyte membrane protein exposure and/or substance release in the interkeratinocytic space...|$|R
