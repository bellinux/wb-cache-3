5|$|Around 60,000 former Czar's army troopers {{remained}} {{stationed in}} Finland in January 1918. The soldiers were demoralized and war-weary, and the home-sick, former serfs were thirsty for farmland set free by the revolutions. The majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> returned to Russia {{by the end}} of March 1918. In total 7,000 to 10,000 Red Russian warmen supported the Finnish Reds, but around 4,000, in separate smaller units of 100–1,000 soldiers, could be persuaded to fight in the front line.|$|E
5|$|As general Yang Pu {{returned}} north {{with his}} soldiers after the Han–Nanyue War in 111 BC, he requested the emperor's permission to annex Dongyue. The emperor refused after {{he considered the}} morale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>troops.</b> Zou Yushan had promised to supply an army to assist the Han in their war against the Nanyue. The army never arrived and Zou blamed the weather conditions, while secretly maintaining a diplomatic relationship with Nanyue.|$|E

5|$|Caracalla's {{official}} portrayal as sole emperor marks a {{break from}} the detached images of the philosopher-emperors who preceded him: his close-cropped haircut is that of a soldier, his pugnacious scowl a realistic and threatening presence. This rugged soldier-emperor, an iconic archetype, was adopted by most of the following emperors, such as Maximinus Thrax, who were dependent on the support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> to rule the empire.|$|E
5|$|France's {{defeat in}} Indochina, {{coupled with the}} German {{destruction}} of her armies just 14 years earlier, seriously damaged its prestige elsewhere in its colonial empire, {{as well as with}} its NATO allies, most importantly, the United States. Within its empire, the defeat in Indochina served to spur independence movements in other colonies, notably the North African territories from which many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> who fought at Điện Biên Phủ had been recruited.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defence, Croatia doubled {{the size of its}} police force to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was the 3,000-strong special police that were deployed in 12 battalions, adopting military organisation. In addition there were 9,000–10,000 regionally organised reserve police. The reserve police were set up in 16 battalions and 10 companies, but they lacked weapons needed to arm many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>troops.</b>|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of May 9, Benedict Arnold quite unexpectedly arrived on the scene. Flourishing a commission from the Massachusetts Committee of Safety, he asserted his right to command the expedition. The assembled men refused to acknowledge his authority, insisting they would only follow Allen's lead.

5|$|Paulucci reorganised the Kingdom's infantry, {{increasing}} the number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>troops,</b> modifying the brigade system and facing both enthusiastic approval and bitter critic, especially from {{the heir to the}} throne, Prince Carlo Alberto.

5|$|The {{etymology}} of {{the title}} ("commander") suggests that voivodes had significant military duties. They were the supreme leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> recruited in the counties under their jurisdiction. Although law obliged noblemen {{to fight in the}} king's army, Transylvanian nobles fought under the command of the voivode. Furthermore, the voivodes had their own private retinue, formed primarily by armed noblemen. Their right to raise an army under their own flag was confirmed by legislation in 1498.|$|E

The attack, spearheaded by the 9th Armoured Battalion, reached Gornji Malovan on 10 April, the day Robert Zadro was killed. Fighting continued around Kupres until 11 April. Most of the Bosnian Croat TO troops, formally reorganised as the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO) on 8 April, withdrew from the Kupres Plateau towards Šuica, while a small portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> was forced to retreat via the Mount Cincar towards Livno.|$|E

Adams wanted the soldiers to have a fair trial, because this would show that Boston was not controlled by a lawless mob, but was instead the victim of an unjust occupation. He convinced his cousins John Adams and Josiah Quincy to defend the soldiers, knowing that those Whigs would not slander Boston to gain an acquittal. However, Adams wrote essays condemning {{the outcome of the}} trials; he thought that the soldiers should have been convicted of murder.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Messolonghi, Western Europe decided to {{intervene}} in favour of revolutionary Greece. Their attitude toward the Ottoman Empire's Egyptian ally, Ibrahim Pasha, was especially critical; their primary objective was to elicit the evacuation of the occupied regions, the Peloponnese in particular. The intervention began when a Franco-Russo-British fleet {{was sent to the}} region, winning the Battle of Navarino in October 1827. In August 1828, a French expeditionary corps disembarked at Koroni in the southern Peloponnese. The soldiers were stationed on the peninsula until the evacuation of Egyptian troops in October, then taking control of the principal strongholds still held by Turkish troops. Although the bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> returned to France from the end of 1828, there was a French presence in the area until 1833.|$|E
5|$|After this, {{the troops}} {{went to the}} nearby village of Saint-Philippe, where they stayed {{overnight}} and received assistance from the townspeople. Captain Holland contacted C. W. Bennett, the British Consul at Saint-Denis, and they secured passage to Mauritius on the SS Lalpoora, located at Pointe des Galets. After brief stops in Saint-Joseph and St. Pierre, the troops were transported to Pointe des Galets by train. The Lalpoora left Réunion on the mid-afternoon of 17 January, and they arrived in Mauritius early the next morning. The officers of Warren Hastings were praised for the discipline and bravery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> involved in the evacuation; however, Captain Holland had to face a court martial for losing the ship; he was reprimanded and subsequently acquitted.|$|E
