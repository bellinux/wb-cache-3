40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} teachers' attitudes {{to changes in}} the {{education}} and <b>the</b> curriculum <b>reform</b> <b>of</b> regional education system in the Czech Republic. <b>The</b> curriculum <b>reform</b> is a significant change for the education policy and the teachers' attitudes are important for <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> implementation. <b>The</b> methodology is based on quantitative and qualitative data analysis. Theoretical basis are the theories about teachers' beliefs and attitudes and a belief system according to Paul A. Sabatier. The teachers' approach to <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> is defined as their acceptance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> and <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> their activities in <b>the</b> <b>reform.</b> <b>The</b> teachers' acceptance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> is formulated in two dimensions. The first one is teachers' acceptance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> objectives. <b>The</b> other one is teachers' acceptance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new teacher role as a co-creator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curriculum. The teachers' attitudes appear to be mainly problematic in the second category which deals to formalism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reform.</b> As main reasons of teachers' disagreement on <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> were identified <b>the</b> problems in <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> implementation phase, teachers' ideological opposition to <b>the</b> <b>reform,</b> inadequate explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> meaning by central authorities, which leads to a misunderstanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> objectives by teachers, and an implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> [...] ...|$|R

Cognizant that the old law would expire November 30, 1797, Garrard issued a proclamation on November 3 calling the legislature into special session. The legislators convened on November 28, and Garrard, drawing on {{his experience as a}} surveyor, addressed them regarding the urgency of adopting a new law and forestalling more lawsuits related to land claims, which were already numerous. Although a wealthy landowner himself, Garrard advocated protecting Kentucky's large debtor class from foreclosure on their lands. Garrard supported pro-squatting legislation, including measures that forbade the collection of taxes from squatters on profits they made from working the land they occupied and that required landowners to pay squatters for any improvements they made on their land. Despite opposition from some aristocratic legislators like John Breckinridge, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reforms</b> advocated by Garrard were approved in the session.|$|E
5|$|On Mary's {{death in}} 1558, the English Reformation resumed its course, and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reforms</b> instituted during Edward's reign were {{reinstated}} in the Elizabethan Religious Settlement. Queen Elizabeth replaced Mary's councillors and bishops with ex-Edwardians, such as William Cecil, Northumberland's former secretary, and Richard Cox, Edward's old tutor, who preached an anti-Catholic sermon {{at the opening}} of parliament in 1559. Parliament passed an Act of Uniformity the following spring that restored, with modifications, Cranmer's prayer book of 1552; and the Thirty-nine Articles of 1563 were largely based on Cranmer's Forty-two Articles. The theological developments of Edward's reign provided a vital source of reference for Elizabeth's religious policies, though the internationalism of the Edwardian Reformation was never revived.|$|E

5|$|The state's {{financial}} position was poor. Supporters of the dictatorship attempted to block progress on reforming the economy.

The government attempted to tackle the dire poverty in rural areas by instituting an eight-hour day and giving the security of tenure to farm workers. Landlords complained. The effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reforms</b> was dependent on the skill of the local governance, which was often badly lacking. Changes to the military were needed and education reform was another problem facing the Republic.

5|$|Castro {{believed}} in the need for reform if Cuban socialism was {{to survive in a}} world now dominated by capitalist free markets. In October 1991, the Fourth Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held in Santiago, at which a number of important changes to the government were announced. Castro would step down as head of government, to be replaced by the much younger Carlos Lage, although Castro would remain the head of the Communist Party and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. Many older members of government were to be retired and replaced by their younger counterparts. A number of economic changes were proposed, and subsequently put to a national referendum. Free farmers' markets and small-scale private enterprises would be legalized in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, while U.S. dollars were also made legal tender. Certain restrictions on emigration were eased, allowing more discontented Cuban citizens to move to the United States. Further democratization was to be brought in by having the National Assembly's members elected directly by the people, rather than through municipal and provincial assemblies. Castro welcomed debate between proponents and opponents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reforms,</b> although over time he began to increasingly sympathise with the opponent's positions, arguing that such reforms must be delayed.|$|E

5|$|In response, the {{legislature}} published the revisions on its own, effectively creating {{a situation of}} dual constitutions. As {{there was not a}} quorum, the Supreme Court was unable to act. To solve the situation, the legislators appointed six new justices, but the Court still refused to act, as doing so would be to accept the appointments and thus validate the new constitution. Chamorro choreographed a ruling from the Supreme Court which voided the Assembly's publication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reforms,</b> provoking the Assembly to refuse to acknowledge the Court's authority. As international investors began to fret over the ensuing instability and evaluate further aid, the Roman Catholic cardinal, Miguel Obando y Bravo, stepped in as mediator and brokered an accord. Chamorro agreed to publish the new constitution, as required by law, and the assembly agreed to allow the president to continue to negotiate foreign aid and tax measures, though no longer by decree. One of the most contentious provisions, the one banning nepotism was conceded by Chamorro. Both sides claimed victory, though the Supreme Court issue was still not resolved with the Assembly insisting their appointees were valid and the President refusing to acknowledge them.|$|E
5|$|The {{major element}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reforms</b> was the {{creation}} of an expeditionary force, specifically prepared and trained for intervening in a major war. This had existed before, but it had not been well-prepared for overseas service, and the newly organised force would have a permanent peacetime organisation and a full complement of supporting troops. At the same time, the reserve forces were restructured and expanded to ensure that the overseas forces could be efficiently reinforced and supplied with new recruits. To ensure that home defence would not suffer from sending the regular forces overseas, the Militia formed the Special Reserve and the Volunteer Force and the Yeomanry were reorganised into a new Territorial Force; these latter two reforms were grouped together in the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907. To encourage the development of military skills, an Officer Training Corps was established in public schools and universities. Military strategy was revitalised by a new Imperial General Staff, which would ensure a common doctrine and common strategic aims among the various military forces of the British Empire, including the Dominions as well as British India. Finally, the Regular Army itself would be reformed by {{the development of a new}} operational and training doctrine, laid down in Douglas Haig's new Field Service Pocket Book.|$|E
5|$|While visiting Ghana in 1960, Du Bois {{spoke with}} its {{president}} about {{the creation of}} a new encyclopedia of the African diaspora, the Encyclopedia Africana. In early 1961, Ghana notified Du Bois that they had appropriated funds to support the encyclopedia project, and they invited Du Bois to come to Ghana and manage the project there. In October 1961, at the age of 93, Du Bois and his wife traveled to Ghana to take up residence and commence work on the encyclopedia. In early 1963, the United States refused to renew his passport, so he made the symbolic gesture of becoming a citizen of Ghana. While it is sometimes stated that he renounced his U.S. citizenship at that time, and he did state his intention to do so, Du Bois never actually did. His health declined during the two years he was in Ghana, and he died on August 27, 1963, in the capital of Accra at the age of 95. Du Bois was buried in Accra near his home, which is now the Du Bois Memorial Centre. A day after his death, at the March on Washington, speaker Roy Wilkins asked the hundreds of thousands of marchers to honor Du Bois with a moment of silence. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, embodying many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reforms</b> Du Bois had campaigned for his entire life, was enacted almost a year after his death.|$|E
