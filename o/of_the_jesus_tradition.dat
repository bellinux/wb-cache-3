50|$|Although Kloppenborg {{cautioned against}} {{assuming}} that Qs composition {{history is the}} same as the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> (i.e., that the oldest layer of Q is necessarily the oldest and pure-layer Jesus tradition), some recent seekers of the Historical Jesus, including members of the Jesus Seminar, have done just that.

40|$|The {{literary}} mindset (‘default setting’) {{of modern}} Western culture prevents those trained in that culture from recognizing that oral cultures operate differently.

But the earliest phase of transmission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> was without doubt predominantly by word of mouth. And recent studies of oral cultures provide several characteristic features of oral tradition. Much of the Synoptic tradition, even in its present form, reflects in particular the combination of stability and flexibility so characteristic of the performances of oral tradition. Re-envisaging the early transmission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> therefore requires us to recognize that the literary paradigm (including a clearly delineated Q document) is too restrictive in the range of possible explanations it offers for the diverse/divergent character of Synoptic parallels.

The first main part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dissertation aims to establish whether <b>Jesus</b> <b>traditions</b> in Paul s letters can be presupposed, as it often {{has been argued that}} Paul did not have much knowledge about Jesus or that he was disinterested in the life and teachings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical <b>Jesus.</b> In these discussions, <b>the</b> biography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apostle Paul is examined. Based on the places Paul had visited after his conversion, his encounters with people close to Jesus and his initial preaching when founding new congregations, it has to be assumed that Paul was well informed about <b>Jesus.</b> <b>The</b> explicit references to sayings of Jesus in Paul s letters (1 Cor 7 : 10 11; 9 : 14; 11 : 23 25) confirm that Paul knew and used <b>Jesus</b> <b>traditions</b> similar to those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> synoptic gospels. In the second main part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dissertation possible allusions (instances in which Paul uses <b>Jesus</b> <b>traditions</b> without explicitly indicating it) to <b>Jesus</b> <b>traditions</b> in Paul s letters are investigated and compared to similar synoptic sayings of Jesus. Allusions to <b>Jesus</b> <b>traditions</b> in 1 Thessalonians and Romans are revisited. Special attention is paid to possible allusions in Galatians.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{an investigation}} of the evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition.</b> Christological titles are studied in terms of the social theory of the institutionalization of charismatic authority. It makes use of Anthony Thiselton's and Bengt Holmberg's application of Max Weber's social theory. It is argued that the followers of Jesus acknowledged and expressed his authority by means of naming. These "names" developed into "titles" when the post-Easter followers of Jesus allocated power to him. The process of the institutionalization of Jesus' charismatic authority relates to the transmission from the oral tradition of Jesus' sayings and deeds to the written evidence. The article emphasizes the work done by the Jesus Seminar. The following "rules of written evidence" are considered: clustering and contexting; revision and commentary; false attribution; difficult sayings and the process of christianising. In Part 2 of the study, Weber,s social theory is applied to the Christological title "Son of Man"...|$|E
40|$|This study {{makes use}} of Ferdinand Hahn's {{insights}} (with Son of God as case study) to indicate how the naming of Jesus developed in stages.

In the book traits of the "shamanic complex" are heuristically used to explain the layering of traditions as reconfigurations of each other within the same cultural area and to argue for continuity from the cultural constitution of a social personage to the communication and enscripturation of that social personage within the same cultural system. Jesus' healings and his encountering of spirits are {{understood in terms of}} the notion of alternate states of consciousness as polyphased consciousness. The book's point of departure is the conviction that an anthropological-sensitive reading scenario represents an epistemological alternative to that of scholars who emphasize the historical-critical analysis of strata in the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition.</b> The article consists of an appraisal and a critique. It argues for a different judgment rather than posing a thesis of a paradigm shift.

50|$|A modern {{consensus}} {{exists that}} Jesus {{must be understood}} as a Jew in a Jewish environment. According to scholar Bart D. Ehrman, Jesus was so very firmly rooted in his own time and place as a first-century Palestinian Jew - with his ancient Jewish comprehension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, and God - that he does not translate easily into a modern idiom. Ehrman stresses that Jesus was raised in a Jewish household in <b>the</b> Jewish hamlet <b>of</b> Nazareth. He was brought up in a Jewish culture, accepted Jewish ways and eventually became a Jewish teacher, who, like other Jewish teachers of his time, debated <b>the</b> Law <b>of</b> Moses orally. Early Christians sustained these teachings of Jesus orally. Rabbis or teachers in every generation were raised and trained to deliver this oral tradition accurately. It consisted <b>of</b> two parts: <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> (i.e., logia or sayings of Jesus) and inspired opinion.

40|$|Today, moderns, {{as well as}} biblical scholars, have a {{hard time}} {{accepting}} the possibility that the Gospels are authentic. The idea that a document composed two thousand years ago could be trusted is dismissed as absurd. However, this assumes that there is no evidence suggesting the contrary. Richard Bauckham, in his book, Jesus and the Eyewitnesses, rejects this “gratuitous doubt” and provides a novel contribution to our knowledge of the historical Jesus. This book has awakened scholars to the possibility that the skepticism of form criticism is not only uncritical but also unwarranted. Contra to popular opinion in the field of New Testament scholarship, Bauckham argues that before the Gospels were written, the Jesus tradition was intimately connected to specific eyewitnesses and teachers who functioned as guarantors of the Word. More specifically, he rejects the form critics’ claim that the Gospels were subject to the creative collective of early Church communities and presents compelling evidence illustrating that these traditions were actually transmitted in a formally controlled manner. While opponents of Bauckham’s thesis claim that his work tries to prove too much, I think the author fails to go far enough in his analysis of the data collected. In this essay, I will present a summary of Bauckham’s strongest arguments for the authenticity of the Gospels and evaluate the counter arguments presented by his critics. Furthermore, in an attempt to strengthen the author’s thesis, I will argue that the Gospel of Mark actually reflects {{the way in which the}} human brain encodes memories with high fidelity, thereby demonstrating the faithful transmittance employed in the communication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition...</b>|$|E

Noteworthy too are Dunn’s treatments of the source question (particularly Q and the noncanonical Gospels) and of Jesus the Jew in his Galilean context. In his detailed analysis of the Baptist tradition, the kingdom motif, the call to and character of discipleship, what Jesus’ audiences thought of him, what he thought of himself, why he was crucified, and how and why belief in Jesus’ resurrection began, Dunn engages wholeheartedly in the contemporary debate, providing many important insights and offering a thoroughly convincing account of how Jesus was remembered from the first, and why.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to make a contribution}} to the quest for the historical-Jesus. The Synoptic Gospels give the impression that exorcism was very important in the ministry of Jesus. Yet when we note current studies on Jesus there is not only a general neglect of the miracle stories, but especially of the exorcism stories associated with Jesus. Is this neglect justified? Was exorcism an important part of Jesus' ministry? Have exorcism stories found their way from other traditions into the Jesus material? To answer these questions we begin by surveying a wide variety of material to answer the prior question - what notions of exorcism and exorcists would probably have been available to Jesus' audience in first century Palestine? Having answered this question we examine the principal data in the Synoptic Gospels relating to Jesus and exorcism. We attempt to ascertain which elements of the material can, with reasonable confidence, be attributed to the reports of those who witnessed Jesus as an exorcist and, how the early Church handled this material. We are then {{in a position to make}} our sketch of the historical-Jesus-the-Exorcist which includes an enquiry into how Jesus' audience may have assessed him and how the early Church understood him. Finally as part of our sketch of the historical-Jesus there is a brief chapter on how he may have understood his exorcistic activity. As a result of our examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> we are able to conclude, at least, that Jesus was an exorcist, at one with his time, that the Synoptic Tradition is correct to give considerable emphasis to this aspect of Jesus' ministry, and that Jesus was the first to associate exorcism and eschatology...|$|E
40|$|This {{study has}} used Victor Turner's model of liminality as a {{heuristic}} {{framework for understanding}} the beliefs, behavior, and self-understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early Christian communities. Unlike other groups in liminality who experience communitas in rites of passage separated from the broader society, and ultimately return to reinforce structure, this study proposes that <b>the</b> unique characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early Christian communities was that they lived in communitas within <b>the</b> structures <b>of</b> society and extended those relationships to people outside the community. There were three aspects of liminality that were studied through four different sets <b>of</b> writing in <b>the</b> pre-Constantine communities <b>of</b> Christ followers: <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> represented in Luke's narrative of Jesus' life and teaching, <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community represented in Luke's narrative of Acts, and writings to Pauline communities and post-Pauline communities. In these writings, liminality was expressed as a temporal liminality, embodied liminality, and <b>the</b> liminality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social body. <b>The</b> liminality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social body was exhibited through <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> anti-structure {{for inclusion in the}} community, interpersonal relationships, and authority in the community. Finally, <b>the</b> relationship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anti-structural community to structure was examined. There were several areas <b>of</b> continuity throughout <b>the</b> four sets <b>of</b> writings. First, consistently throughout this period, <b>the</b> early communities <b>of</b> Christ followers understood themselves to be living between the times. For them, the new age had begun, while the old was still present. Second, <b>the</b> followers <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> saw themselves as embodying this liminality through <b>the</b> in-dwelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spirit in their physical body. Through the Spirit, <b>the</b> followers <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> believed they experienced new life in Christ. And third, consistently across <b>traditions</b> followers of <b>Jesus</b> believed they were incorporated into a new community that had a common identity marker, the Spirit. This identity marker transcended structural statuses of gender, ethnicity, wealth, and social rank. The Spirit did not erase these statuses but early Christians were to relate anti-structurally within their structural statuses.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} two separate but related questions.   Firstly, what is Paul’s theology of material possessions, and secondly, {{what is the}} source of the apostle’s thought on this subject.   Our thesis endeavours to answer these questions by hypothesizing that Paul owes his pecuniary thought to the synoptic sermon tradition.   However, unlike other studies that investigate Paul’s use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition,</b> our study does not appeal to verbal parallels to establish this theory.   Rather, our thesis attempts to demonstrate continuity in the broad fiscal thought of Jesus and Paul.   This is accomplished by first demonstrating the plausibility of Paul’s acquaintance with the dominical tradition through evidence related to the apostle’s historical environment and his extant writings.   Then, we establish the likelihood that Paul knew the pre-synoptic sermon tradition because of its ubiquity in early church discipleship, the judgment of form critical scholars, and its pervasive resonances in Pauline literature.   From this point of embarkation, we proceed to articulate the broad fiscal thought of ht e synoptic sermons.   It is found that the synoptic sermons’ fiscal material has a pervasively eschatological orientation, and that in the sermons, Jesus seeks to redefine the financial worldview of Christian disciples.   Having examined the synoptic sermons, we compare their fiscal thought with that expressed by Paul in 1 Corinthians.   Through the course of this comparison, alternate sources in Jewish and Hellenistic literature are considered as potential explanations for any correspondences.   Ultimately, our study concludes that Jesus’ and Paul’s financial thought evidences remarkable symmetry that cannot be explained by a shared cultural environment.   Consequently, we determine that Paul depends on the dominical tradition for the contours of his financial thought.

40|$|The {{letters of}} Paul speak more {{frequently}} of the resurrected and exalted Jesus {{than they do}} of the earthly Jesus. Nonetheless, {{this does not mean}} that the apostle and his addressees did not know the teachings and main events of Jesus’ life. Their insistence as to the heavenly identity of Jesus is as likely to have been motivated by contextual factors which guided the development of the primitive Christological confessions which Paul received in the years after his conversion. This article will focus on two of these factors: the configuration of the Christian communities of the Diaspora as foreign cults in a context of religious plurality and the new revelatory experiences which triggered the formation of a binitarian faith. Determining the relationship between Jesus and Paul is one of the fundamental tasks of those who, like Prof. Andries van Aarde, study the origins of Christianity and the beginnings of Christian theology. The basic question in this regard, at least as it has been formulated recently by David Wenham (1995), is whether Paul was a follower of Jesus or the founder of Christianity (see also Wedderburn [1989] and Barbaglio [2006]). In this brief article, I would like to consider one aspect of this general topic and to offer a few suggestions that might contribute to a better understanding of the peculiar vision of Jesus that we find in the letters of Paul. In them, in fact, the apostle moves from the incarnation to the death and resurrection, leaving in the shadows the activity and teaching of Jesus to which the gospels subsequently give so much importance. This contrast raises some questions concerning the knowledge which Paul had <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> and the value he accorded to it: What did he know about Jesus? Did he know the traditions which the evangelists later collected? Why does he not refer to them in his letters more frequently? By contrast, why does he give so much importance to the death and resurrection of Jesus and to Jesus’ divine condition?How to cite this article: Guijarro, S., 2011, ‘The Jesus of Paul: A contribution from the social sciences’, HTS Teologiese Studies/Theological Studies 67 (1), Art. # 862, 6 pages.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{historical}} analysis of Jesus's resurrection miracles in the synoptic tradition, namely, {{the stories of}} the raising of Jairus's daughter (Mark 5 : 21 [...] 43 and par.) and the widow of Nain's son (Luke 7 : 11 [...] 17), and the story of the exorcism of a possessed boy (Mark 9 : 14 [...] 29 and par.), which can be considered a raising-of-the-dead story only in the Gospel of Mark. The analysis done in this thesis differs from other analyses in that it takes seriously both the oral and written nature of the gospels and the traditions behind them. The analysis also differs in that it uses a different historical framework: it works from a position of a very high Christology, frequent communication between Christian centres, and a definite authority structure within the early Christian community from its beginning. These items all affect how one will view the control of the oral tradition, which in turn will affect how one will analyse the differences between the synoptic versions of the stories of Jairus's daughter and the possessed boy, and how one will judge the fact that the story of the widow of Nain's son is found only in Luke. In regards to the written nature of the gospels, it is argued that the primary structuring device used by the gospel authors is chiastic (concentric) in nature. To demonstrate this a new statistical method for judging chiasms has been developed. A large section of Mark (1 : 12 [...] 6 : 46) is divided into both longer and shorter units, and then the parallels [...] -both word and conceptual [...] - between each unit and all the other units are noted. This data is then not only used to judge the level of parallelism between units, but also to perform probability calculations on found chiastic structures. The demonstration of chiastic structures is useful in analysing possible redactional changes the gospel authors may have made to the Jesus tradition in order to create their chiasms. Also, because chiastic structures can impart meaning, elements that may have been added for theological reasons are also highlighted. The result of both the oral and chiastic analyses is a completely new methodology for judging the historicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition...</b>|$|E
40|$|The early Church was a {{narrative}} fellowship which narrativized <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> and per-formed it from memory. It {{did so by}} using specific narrative and mnemonic forms <b>of</b> commu-nication. <b>The</b> chreia combines features of narrativity, oral performance, and memory and con-stituted a basic element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> narrative mosaic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church. <b>The</b> author <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gospel <b>of</b> Mark indicates a broader pattern of narrative performance in that he introduces his narrative by combining the chreia with the diēgēma, demonstrating <b>the</b> rhetorical kind <b>of</b> narrativiza-tion that characterizes <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition...</b>|$|R
40|$|Texts, co-texts, and con-texts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empty tomb in <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> An {{investigation}} <b>of</b> texts, co-texts and con-texts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empty tomb in <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> {{provides a}} “situation-specific common background knowledge” (Auer, 1996 : 18 - 19) from which perspective {{this article is}} written. The article aims {{to argue that the}} myth behind the empty tomb in <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> deploys a trajectory of five links. Its origin, <b>the</b> first <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five links, {{is to be found in}} <b>the</b> metaphorical use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motif <b>of</b> recreation analogous to the foundational narrative in Israel’s historical memoirs of God’s “creatio ex nihilo”. The foundational narrative consists of a collective anthropological facet and an indivdual psychological facet. The anthropological facet is manifested in <b>the</b> memoir <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suppression <b>of</b> Israel as a downtrodden nation. The individual facet pertains to the martyred heroes in Israel’s history. In this article <b>the</b> five links <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trajectory are conceptualised in five chronological phases represented by specific textual evidence. They are, firstly, <b>the</b> descent <b>of</b> a corpse into the sheol; secondly, <b>the</b> objectifying <b>of</b> metaphorical language about <b>the</b> resurrection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead, which refers to either Israel as a “corporate personality” or individuals; thirdly, <b>the</b> Hellenisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resurrection belief pattern which existed in the Semitic, Eastern-Mediterranean world, in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theology <b>of</b> apotheosis/divinisation and ideas about immortality and reincarnation; and fourthly, <b>the</b> empowerment <b>of</b> suffering righteous mortals when participating in <b>the</b> renewed life <b>of</b> resurrected/ascended divine heroes. The fifth phase pertains to the period when the other four phases reached an apogee and resurrection belief served as a kind <b>of</b> coping-healing. <b>The</b> article aims to argue that <b>the</b> hermeneutical significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empty tomb in <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> is to be found in the third phase. The modes in terms of which Jesus’ empty tomb were interpreted by the first “Christ-followers” are to be found in phases four and five. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> Gospel <b>of</b> Thomas is a {{collection}} of 114 sayings attributed to Jesus and is primarily composed of rhetorical statements that were used to preserve <b>the</b> teachings <b>of</b> itinerant Greek philosophers. These collections were used to persuade individuals to join the philosophical schools represented, much like <b>the</b> early followers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> movement would use his teachings to convince others to join them as well. However, the theological background for the text is still debated because it contains esoteric and enigmatic references not fully understood by most scholars. This work argues that the theological and philosophical background for <b>the</b> Gospel <b>of</b> Thomas is <b>the</b> Alexandrian School <b>of</b> Middle Platonism. This background contains an understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divine, <b>the</b> secret nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teachings in the text, and <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> daemons in <b>the</b> cosmos. In short, this is my attempt at supplying the hermeneutical key to the text or at least supplying a valid ideological background on which <b>the</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>tradition</b> is cast in <b>the</b> Gospel <b>of</b> Thomas...|$|R
