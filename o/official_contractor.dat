40|$|An {{attempt is}} made in this article to explore and build {{knowledge}} on the close linkage between environmental insecurity and social friction {{in the context of}} rural Odisha, particularly in the wake of neo-liberalist policies. Environmental insecurity and social friction are intertwined with destabilization of natural-resource–based livelihood system, reflected in degradation of land, forests and water, in many cases causing irreversible damage to the ecosystem. What is significant to note is that loss of natural resource base for livelihood has led to unemployment, underemployment of people dependent on such resources, increasing morbidity, distress migration and social disharmony and conflicts at family and community levels. Furthermore, there is transformation of the local social environment with the emergence of an elite group in the form of company <b>officials,</b> <b>contractors,</b> journalists, traders and police/government offi-cials who begin to encroach and control the future of the local communities. One major issue emerges from the research—need for a holistic approach to understand the process of environmental scarcity induced social friction in developing possible strategies, institutions and policies to achieve the desired development goals, transformation of stakeholders and their relationships in a given context...|$|R

40|$|Across the globe, {{corruption}} {{presents a}} major risk that reduces construction project performances by inflating costs {{and reducing the}} quality of the infrastructure commissioned. In developing countries, corruption stifles economic development and engenders social inequality. Using a structured questionnaire survey to elicit direct knowledge and lived experiences of construction practitioners, this study uncovered the prevalence and forms of corrupt practices within the developing country of Ghana. Research findings illustrate that habitual corruption and unethical behavior prevail among public <b>officials,</b> <b>contractors,</b> and construction professionals during the bid evaluation, tendering, and contract implementation stages of a construction contract. This research proffers that corruption is driven by a toxic concoction of high political connections, excessive and reckless sole sourcing of public construction projects, lack of commitment by construction companies in addressing corruption, and the inherently idiosyncratic operational environment of the construction sector. The top five forms of corruption frequently encountered, in descending order, are kickbacks (extortion), bribery, collusion and tender rigging, conflict of interest, and fraud. This research presents a rare glimpse of construction industry corruption in a developing country and provides polemic clarity geared to intellectually challenge readers in government and industry. Future work is required to explore and develop appropriate countermeasures to address corrupt practices and behaviors...|$|R
