5|$|In 2008 Clinton, a Senator and {{candidate}} for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, became the first American woman to win a presidential primary. Traister discusses Clinton's political campaign, which did not focus on her gender, and the misogynistic reactions she received from the media and political opponents. She argues that the Democratic Party's lack <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the sexism of Clinton's opponents led {{a large number of}} liberal female voters to abandon the party, and blames Mark Penn for advising Clinton not to advertise herself as a feminist. Although she originally supported John Edwards' candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, she became a strong supporter of Clinton.|$|E
5|$|Former President Hastings Banda {{established}} a pro-Western {{foreign policy that}} continued into early 2011. It included good diplomatic relationships with many Western countries. The transition from a one-party state to a multi-party democracy strengthened Malawian ties with the United States. Significant numbers of students from Malawi travel to the US for schooling, and the US has active branches of the Peace Corps, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Agency for International Development in Malawi. Malawi maintained close relations with South Africa throughout the Apartheid era, which strained Malawi's relationships with other African countries. Following the collapse of apartheid in 1994, diplomatic relationships were made and maintained into 2011 between Malawi and all other African countries. In 2010, however, Malawi's relationship with Mozambique became strained, partially due to disputes {{over the use of}} the Zambezi River and an inter-country electrical grid. In 2007, Malawi established diplomatic ties with China, and Chinese investment in the country has continued to increase since then, despite concerns regarding treatment of workers by Chinese companies and competition of Chinese business with local companies. In 2011, relations between Malawi and the United Kingdom were damaged when a document was released in which the British ambassador to Malawi criticised President Mutharika. Mutharika expelled the ambassador from Malawi, and in July 2011, the UK announced that it was suspending all budgetary aid because of Mutharika's lack <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> criticisms of his government and economic mismanagement. On 26 July 2011, the United States followed suit, freezing a US$350 million grant, citing concerns regarding the government's suppression and intimidation of demonstrators and civic groups, as well as restriction of the press and police violence.|$|E
25|$|Another study {{conducted}} in 2004 examined the level <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> alcohol and brain response during visual working memory. This study {{looked at the}} neural correlated of the low level <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> alcohol using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} during a challenging visual memory task. The results were that young people who report having needed more alcohol to feel the effects showed higher levels of brain response during visual working memory, this suggests that the individual’s capacity to adjust to cognitive processing decreases, they are less able to adjust cognitive processing to contextual demands.|$|E

25|$|Gene {{effects may}} often be {{dependent}} on the environment. Such interactions are known as G×E interactions, in which {{the effects of a}} gene allele differ across different environments. Simple examples would include situations where a gene multiplies the effect of an environment: perhaps adding 1inch to height in high nutrient environments, but only half an inch to height in low-nutrient environments. This is seen in different slopes <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> an environment for different genotypes.|$|E

25|$|There is no agreed {{treatment}} protocol. In most {{reported cases}} of ORS the attempted treatment was antidepressants, followed by antipsychotics and various psychotherapies. Little data are available regarding the efficacy of these treatments in ORS, but some suggest that psychotherapy yields the highest rate <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> treatment, and that antidepressants are more efficacious than antipsychotics (response rates 78%, 55% and 33% respectively). According to one review, 43% of cases which showed overall improvement required more than one treatment approach, and in only 31% did the first administered treatment lead to some improvement.|$|E

25|$|It {{is unknown}} if {{anaerobic}} training changes individual hormone profiles, or if conditioned athletes in studies self-selected because of physiologic predisposition to athletic conditioning. There is variation <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> anaerobic stress depending on exercise intensity, age, gender, {{length of time}} studied, and time at which serum indices were drawn. Most studies report that testosterone increases or is unchanged acutely, though some even report it to decrease. Anaerobic exercisers have testosterone levels below sedentary controls in cross sectional analysis. Over months to years, levels are stable to slightly increased.|$|E
25|$|At a {{symptomatic}} level, {{sleep is}} characterized by lack of reactivity to sensory inputs, low motor output, diminished conscious awareness and rapid reversibility to wakefulness. However, to translate these into a biological definition is difficult because no single pathway in the brain {{is responsible for the}} generation and regulation of sleep. One of the earliest proposals was to define sleep as the deactivation of the cerebral cortex and the thalamus because of near lack <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> sensory inputs during sleep. However, this was invalidated because both regions are active in some phases of sleep. In fact, it appears that the thalamus is only deactivated in the sense of transmitting sensory information to the cortex.|$|E
25|$|At dawn on 25 January, {{the three}} frigates and one sloop of Galloway's {{division}} were sighted from the San Francisco de Asís sailing north-eastwards {{at a distance}} of 11 leagues from the port of Cádiz, parallel to the city. The lack <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the signals of recognition made from the Spanish ship put on alert its crew. The British ships began to come close to the San Francisco de Asís relying on their lightness and their advantage, both in number and in artillery, as the division's ships mounted 40 pieces each of the two heaviest frigates, 34 the lesser one, and 28 the sloop. Minerve and Meleager were armed, moreover, with 24-pounder carronades.|$|E
40|$|<b>Responses</b> <b>to</b> tones, clicks, {{and noise}} were {{recorded}} from chinchilla auditory-nerve fibers (ANFs). The <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> noise {{were analyzed by}} computing the zeroth-, first-, and second-order Wiener kernels (h(0), h(1), and h(2)). The h(1) s correctly predicted the frequency tuning and phases <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> tones <b>of</b> ANFs with low characteristic frequency (CF). The h(2) s correctly predicted the frequency tuning and phases <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> tones <b>of</b> all ANFs, regardless of CF. Also regardless of CF, the kernels jointly predicted about 77 % of the features <b>of</b> ANF <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> "frozen" samples <b>of</b> noise. Near-CF group delays of kernels and signal-front delays <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> intense rarefaction clicks exceeded by 1 ms the corresponding basilar-membrane delays at both apical and basal sites of the chinchilla cochlea. This result, confirming that synaptic and neural processes amount to 1 ms regardless of CF, permitted drawing a map of basilar-membrane delay {{as a function of}} position for {{the entire length of the}} chinchilla cochlea, a first for amniotic species...|$|R

25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the biotechnology revolution, much research has been also focused on using genetically modified endophytes to improve plant yields and defensive properties. The genetic basis <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> herbivory is being explored in tall fescue, where it appears the production of jasmonic acid {{may play a role in}} downregulation of the host plant’s chemical defense pathways when a fungal endophyte is present. In some cases, fungi that are closely associated with their hosts have transferred genes for secondary metabolite production to the host genome, which could help to explain multiple origins of chemical defenses within the phylogeny of various groups of plants. This represents an important line of inquiry to pursue, especially in regards to understanding the chemical pathways that can be utilized in biotechnological applications.|$|E
25|$|Since its foundation, {{the socialist}} party has opposed every war – {{including}} both World War I and World War II. Although, in its early years, party writers frequently would contrast the numbers of dead in wars with the numbers killed and maimed in industrial incidents (by {{way of trying to}} contrast the passions and efforts put into war with the lack <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the conditions of capitalism) the party argued that wars in capitalism were fought {{in the interests of the}} capitalist class and – as with their case against nationalism – the workers did all the dying for no gain for themselves. Further, they emphasised that while the press and politicians tried to call for strike moderation, the capitalists would continue the class war despite hostilities, forcing down wages and up consumer good prices. During both wars, some members won Conscientious objector status.|$|E
25|$|The {{island of}} Ambon, in the Dutch East Indies, was {{perceived}} to be under threat from Japan because of its potential as a major air base. However, by mid-December 1941, only two flights of RAAF light bombers were deployed there, along with assorted obsolete US Navy and Royal Netherlands Navy aircraft. The 8th Division's 1,100-strong Gull Force, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Leonard Roach, commanding officer of the 2/21st Battalion, arrived on 17 December. In addition to the 2/21st Battalion, it included 8th Division artillery and support units. The existing Royal Netherlands East Indies Army garrison, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Kapitz, consisted of 2,800 Indonesian colonial troops, with Dutch officers. Kapitz was appointed Allied commander on Ambon. Roach had visited the island before Gull Force's deployment and requested that more artillery and machine gun units be sent from Australia. Roach complained about the lack <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> his suggestions, and he was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel John Scott on 13 January 1942.|$|E
