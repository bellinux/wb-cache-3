Medication {{is also used to}} control post-traumatic epilepsy; however the preventive use of anti-epileptics is not recommended. In those cases where the person is bedridden due to a reduction of consciousness, has to remain in a wheelchair because of mobility problems, or has any <b>other</b> <b>problem</b> heavily impacting self-caring capacities, caregiving and nursing are critical.|$|E
25|$|The <b>other</b> <b>problem</b> is {{that while}} radio {{transmissions}} can be broadcast in all directions, lasers are highly directional.

25|$|Introducing multi-aspect {{signalling}} {{would require}} substantial reworking for the existing lines, as additional distant signals {{would need to}} be added onto long blocks and the signals reworked on shorter ones. In addition, it wouldn't solve the <b>other</b> <b>problem</b> with high-speed operation, the difficulty of seeing signals as a train rushes past, especially in marginal conditions such as rain, snow, and fog.|$|E

25|$|In {{particular}} cases, usually {{because of}} illness or some <b>other</b> <b>problem,</b> an exarch of any rank can be assisted by {{the appointment of}} a colleague who is called Coadjutor exarch. The position of coadjutor exarch towards his superior exarch is similar to the position of Latin coadjutor bishop towards his superior diocesan bishop. Coadjutor exarchs are appointed with rights of succession. For example, in 1993 titular Bishop Christo Proykov of Briula was appointed Coadjutor to Apostolic Exarch of Sofia, Methodius Stratiev, and when later died in 1995, coadjutor exarch succeeded him as new Apostolic Exarch.|$|E
25|$|Revertive pulsing (RP) worked {{faster than}} {{standard}} dial pulses, {{but the main}} advantage was in problem detection. In earlier systems, when a worn pawl or <b>other</b> <b>problem</b> in a Strowger selector caused it to fail to advance, only the calling party could detect the error as no connection was achieved. The caller eventually lost patience and redialed the call. The same user or another might get connected to the faulty selector again. Therefore, one bad Strowger selector could block many calls until subscriber complaints alerted staff to the problem.|$|E
25|$|One {{popular and}} cheap source for bench top {{material}} is old bowling alley lanes. These are usually made from thick, high-quality laminated maple. Two problems present themselves with bowling alley wood: first, the waxes {{used on the}} surface for bowling frequently contain silicone and other substances that can play havoc with work pieces at finishing time - a little silicone on a project will cause trouble with many finishes, and won't manifest it until it's too late. The <b>other</b> <b>problem</b> with bowling alley wood is nails. Most pieces have loads of nails buried in them, which do not mix well with woodworking tools.|$|E

25|$|The <b>other</b> <b>problem</b> in {{duplicating}} {{the experimental}} conditions {{is the problem}} of maintaining fixed charge density in the two baths. This problem is treated by maintaining the specified density in two buffer regions extending from the boundary plane toward the membrane. The number of ions needed to maintain the density in the two buffer regions is calculated {{at the start of the}} simulations. The count of the ions in these buffers is sampled throughout the simulation and an ion is injected whenever a deficit is observed. The initial velocity of the injected particle is decided according to Maxwellian distribution. It should be noted that the ions can leave the system only by exiting through the two Dirichlet boundary planes and an ion is not removed artificially from these buffer regions. The reflections from the Neumann boundary planes are treated as elastic reflections.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, Aerotransport and Aeroflot {{had started}} a {{cooperation}} on a route between Stockholm and Moscow, with connections from Stockholm to Siberia and Irkutsk and Vladivostok. Aerotransport wanted to connect westwards via DNL's network to Foynes, with connection to Pan Am's flights. However, the proposal was rejected by Aeroflot. The <b>other</b> <b>problem</b> was that Imperial Airways wanted to prioritize British, rather than Scandinavian, mail on west-bound flights, causing DNL to cancel their plans to connect to Ireland. In a meeting in Berlin on 10 January 1939, the four Nordic airlines agreed to let DNL continue to negotiate with Pan Am about pooling transatlantic flights, with DNL representing all four companies. Support was gained from the Nordic post companies, who would guarantee {{for the use of}} the route. DNL's Bernt Balchen went to the United States to negotiate with American authorities and suppliers to start a route.|$|E
25|$|The {{second point}} of {{contention}} between freewill and open theists is exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future contingent events. Freewill theists have traditionally affirmed {{what is known as}} simple foreknowledge according to which God, prior to creation, just “sees” or knows all that will ever happen in history. Sanders argues that the simple foreknowledge view has conflicts with types of biblical texts mentioned below and has two philosophical problems. The first problem is the old debate about whether or not divine foreknowledge entails determinism. Open theists argue that exhaustive definite foreknowledge is incompatible with the freewill of creatures. The <b>other</b> <b>problem</b> with simple foreknowledge is that it is useless for God to possess it since once God knows {{what is going to happen}} God cannot change it from happening. Sanders argues that simple foreknowledge cannot explain such things as prophecy, divine guidance, or why God did not prevent particular evils. Instead, open theists affirm “dynamic omniscience” (a term coined by Sanders). God knows all that has happened in the past and all that is happening in the present. God knows those future events that are determined to occur and God knows all that could possibly happen but does not know as definite what creatures with freewill will do. God has anticipatory knowledge (foresight) of what we are likely to do so God is not caught off-guard.|$|E

500|$|While {{the median}} was built, a few {{problems}} {{needed to be}} resolved {{in order for the}} road to work both safely and in an environmentally friendly way. Emergency personnel needed to quickly access accidents and provide them easy transport to nearby hospitals. To alleviate this problem, Caltrans implemented electric gate technology, which would allow emergency vehicles to cut through certain parts of the median. The <b>other</b> <b>problem</b> was to both protect the plant life and the salt marsh harvest mice [...] residing around the highway. As a result, crews placed timbers and sheeting to protect foliage, and added holes into the median barrier to allow the mice to cross the highway.|$|E
500|$|Also in 1844 Hańska won her lawsuit. The {{wealth of}} her late husband's estate would go to Anna, who had become engaged to a Polish Count, Jerzy Mniszech. They planned to marry in 1846, after which time Hańska would bestow the inheritance. Thus Hańska's {{marriage}} to Balzac would have to wait. In the meantime, two urgent problems began to complicate their plans. One was his health, which had been deteriorating for years. In October 1843 he wrote to her about [...] "horrible suffering which has its seat nowhere; which cannot be described; which attacks both heart and brain". Balzac's <b>other</b> <b>problem</b> was financial: despite his illness, he {{could not afford to}} relax his work schedule, since he owed more than 200,000 francs to various creditors.|$|E
500|$|... 2-satisfiability is NL-complete, {{meaning that}} {{it is one of}} the [...] "hardest" [...] or [...] "most expressive" [...] {{problems}} in the complexity class NL of problems solvable nondeterministically in logarithmic space. Completeness here means that a deterministic Turing machine using only logarithmic space can transform any <b>other</b> <b>problem</b> in NL into an equivalent 2-satisfiability problem. [...] Analogously to similar results for the more well-known complexity class NP, this transformation together with the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem allow any problem in NL to be represented as a second order logic formula with a single existentially quantified predicate with clauses limited to length 2. Such formulae are known as SO-Krom. [...] Similarly, the implicative normal form can be expressed in first order logic with the addition of an operator for transitive closure.|$|E

2500|$|To {{attack the}} P = NP question, {{the concept of}} NP-completeness is very useful. NP-complete {{problems}} are a set of problems to each of which any other NP-problem can be reduced in polynomial time, and whose solution may still be verified in polynomial time. That is, any NP problem can be transformed {{into any of the}} NP-complete problems. Informally, an NP-complete problem is an NP problem that is at least as [...] "tough" [...] as any <b>other</b> <b>problem</b> in NP.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>other</b> <b>problem</b> {{is that of}} overdetermination. [...] Imagine two hunters, A and B, {{who each}} negligently fire a shot that takes out C's eye. [...] Each shot on its own would have been {{sufficient}} to cause the damage. [...] But for A's shot, would C's eye have been taken out? [...] Yes. [...] The same answer follows in relation to B's shot. [...] But on the but-for test, this leads us to the counterintuitive position that neither shot caused the injury. However, courts have held {{that in order to}} prevent each of the defendants avoiding liability for lack of actual cause, it is necessary to hold both of them responsible, See Summers v. Tice, 33 Cal.2d 80, 199 P.2d 1 (1948). [...] This is known, simply, as the Summers v. Tice Rule.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>other</b> <b>problem</b> {{was that}} the Stangensteuerung never worked well {{with more than one}} gun. Two (or even three) guns, mounted side by side and firing simultaneously, would have {{produced}} a wide spread of fire that would have been impossible to match with the [...] "safe zone" [...] between the whirling propeller blades. Fokker's initial answer to this was the fitting of extra [...] "followers" [...] to the Stangensteuerung's large cam wheel, to (theoretically) produce the [...] "ripple" [...] salvo necessary to ensure that the guns were aimed at the same point on the propeller disc. This proved a disastrously unstable arrangement in the case of three guns, and was rather less than satisfactory even for two. Most of the early Fokker and Halberstadt biplane fighters were limited to a single gun for this reason.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{conditions}} that may better explain symptoms must be excluded.

These conditions may lead the woman {{to believe that she}} has PMS, when the underlying disorder may be some <b>other</b> <b>problem,</b> such as anemia, hypothyroidism, eating disorders and substance abuse. [...] A key feature is that these conditions may also be present outside of the luteal phase. Conditions that can be magnified perimenstrually include depression or other affective disorders, migraine, seizure disorders, fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, and allergies. Problems with other aspects of the female reproductive system must be excluded, including dysmenorrhea (pain during the menstrual period, rather than before it), endometriosis, perimenopause, and adverse effects produced by oral contraceptive pills.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{details of}} the {{algorithm}} require careful thought. For many cases, estimating the error from quadrature over an interval for a function f(x) isn't obvious. One popular solution is to use two different rules of quadrature, and use their difference as {{an estimate of the}} error from quadrature. The <b>other</b> <b>problem</b> is deciding what [...] "too large" [...] or [...] "very small" [...] signify. A local criterion for [...] "too large" [...] is that the quadrature error should not be larger than tnbsp&middot&nbsp&h where t, a real number, is the tolerance we wish to set for global error. Then again, if h is already tiny, it may not be worthwhile to make it even smaller even if the quadrature error is apparently large. A global criterion is that the sum of errors on all the intervals should be less thannbsp&t. [...] This type of error analysis is usually called [...] "a posteriori" [...] since we compute the error after having computed the approximation.|$|E
