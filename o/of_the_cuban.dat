5|$|Like {{many other}} Latin American intellectuals, Vargas Llosa was {{initially}} a supporter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> revolutionary government of Fidel Castro. He studied Marxism in depth as a university student {{and was later}} persuaded by communist ideals after the success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Revolution. Gradually, Vargas Llosa {{came to believe that}} socialism was incompatible with what he considered to be general liberties and freedoms. The official rupture between the writer and the policies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> government occurred with the so-called 'Padilla Affair', when the Castro regime imprisoned the poet Heberto Padilla for a month in 1971. Vargas Llosa, along with other intellectuals of the time, wrote to Castro protesting the Cuban political system and its imprisonment of the artist. Vargas Llosa has identified himself with liberalism rather than extreme left-wing political ideologies ever since. Since he relinquished his earlier leftism, he has opposed both left- and right-wing authoritarian regimes.|$|E
5|$|The 310 series (the Model 318) {{also saw}} transatlantic service with Cubana de Aviación {{starting}} in 1958, in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Revolution the airline {{had a special}} accord with British aircraft manufacturers to maintain this model of aircraft. In 1975 Cuban Britannias were used to transport hundreds of soldiers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Revolutionary Armed Forces to Angola in Operation Carlota, a proxy war. Cubana de Aviación continued using various Britannias until March 1990.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Revolution, led by Fidel Castro in 1959, {{almost all of}} Cuba's 15,000 Jews went into exile. The {{majority}} of them fled to Miami, Florida; however, Puerto Rico also received a large influx of Jewish emigres from Cuba.|$|E
2500|$|... 722 Cuban {{soldiers}} were deployed in Grenada During <b>the</b> Invasion <b>of</b> Grenada by U.S. troops in 1983. <b>The</b> <b>Cuban</b> government sent these troops {{there to support}} <b>the</b> leftist government <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country. <b>Cuban</b> losses during <b>the</b> conflict were 25 killed, 59 wounded, and 638 captured. In 2008, <b>the</b> Government <b>of</b> Grenada announced a move to build a monument to honor <b>the</b> <b>Cubans</b> killed during <b>the</b> invasion by Genelle Figuroa. At <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> announcement <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> and Grenadian government are still seeking to locate a suitable site for the monument.|$|R

5|$|Betances openly hated Estrada when {{he first}} met him in the late 1870s, but grew more {{tolerant}} of him with time, and even defended Estrada's actions as leader when he assumed control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Revolutionary Party. The Puerto Rican affiliates to the Party viewed Estrada's leadership with great skepticism, since Estrada sympathized {{with the idea of}} having the United States intervene in the Cuban independence war to have the Spanish evicted from Cuba. They suspected that his weak leadership allowed opportunists to profit from an invasion and even suggest that the United States keep Puerto Rico in exchange for independence for Cuba. Some written evidence points to the truth of their affirmations, at least to the extent of wanting to have the Puerto Rican section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Revolutionary Party shut down, which eventually did happen.|$|E
5|$|Continuing to seek ways to oust Castro {{following}} the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Kennedy {{and his administration}} experimented with various ways of covertly facilitating the overthrow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> government. Significant hopes were pinned on a covert program named the Cuban Project, devised under the Kennedy administration in 1961.|$|E
5|$|In April 1896 Betances {{was granted}} {{diplomatic}} credentials {{on behalf of}} the revolutionary government of Cuba. He became an active fund raiser and recruiter on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> pro-independence movement. He also served as press officer and intelligence contact for the Cuban rebels in exile, and attempted to coordinate support for the pro-independence movement in the Philippines.|$|E
50|$|As <b>the</b> {{expiration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US-Panamanian agreement permitting <b>the</b> <b>Cubans</b> {{to stay in}} Panama approached, planning began for Operation Safe Passage—the return <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cubans</b> to Guantanamo Bay Naval Facility. Between February 1, 1995, and February 20, 1995, {{several hundred}} Cubans were transported from Panama to Guantanamo Naval Base. <b>The</b> mission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transfer operation was to move <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> migrants from Safe Haven camps in Panama to Guantanamo in a safe, orderly manner.|$|R
25|$|I {{watched his}} face, {{and it was}} as grave and serene as that of a man writing in his own library. He was <b>the</b> very {{embodiment}} <b>of</b> tranquillity in occupation. He stood there amid <b>the</b> animal-like babble <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cubans,</b> <b>the</b> crack <b>of</b> rifles, and <b>the</b> whistling snarl <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bullets, and wig-wagged whatever he had to wig-wag without heeding anything but his business. There was not a single trace of nervousness or haste.|$|R

5|$|Rigoberto Herrera, {{a member}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> {{national}} team who had retired and accompanied {{the team from}} Cuba as a guest, defected to the United States during the visit.

5|$|The habitat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> macaw {{was open}} savanna terrain with {{scattered}} trees, {{typical of the}} Zapata Swamp area. Cuba was originally widely covered in forest, much of which has since been converted to cropland and pastures. Lomas de Rompe, where the macaw was also reported, had rainforest-like gallery forest.|$|E
50|$|General Machado was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{youngest}} <b>Cuban</b> generals in <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> War <b>of</b> Independence of 1895 to 1898. He {{fought in}} the middle provinces.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cuban</b> {{struggle}} for independence had captured the North American imagination for years and newspapers had been agitating for intervention with sensational stories of Spanish atrocities against <b>the</b> native <b>Cuban</b> population. Americans {{came to believe that}} Cuba's battle with Spain resembled United States's Revolutionary War. This continued even after Spain replaced Weyler and said it changed its policies, and the North American public opinion was very much in favour of intervening in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cubans.</b>|$|R
25|$|When Héctor José Cámpora assumed <b>the</b> {{presidency}} <b>of</b> Argentina on May 25, 1973, Cuba sent {{a wave of}} {{diplomats and}} official delegates to Argentina, proposing that {{was the time to}} resume cultural interchanges with the Argentine government. However, the Argentine intelligence services distrusted the real motives for <b>the</b> influx <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cubans.</b>|$|R
5|$|Admiral Horacio Rivero, Jr., USN, served {{aboard the}} , {{providing}} artillery cover for Marines landing on Guadalcanal, Marshall Islands, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Rivero eventually reached {{the rank of}} Full-Admiral (four-stars) and in October 1962, {{found himself in the}} middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Missile Crisis. As Commander of amphibious forces, Atlantic Fleet, he was on the front line of the vessels sent to the Caribbean by President Kennedy to stop the Cold War from escalating into World War III.|$|E
5|$|Betances, who had {{collected}} {{more money in}} France for the Party than the plan's potential cost, grew weary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> revolutionary movement's diminishing support of the Puerto Rico independence cause. By then, some of the Party's followers stationed in France wanted Betances to be stripped of his posts and assignments. At least two of them insulted him publicly, and even took advantage of Simplicia Jiménez's mental health to have her harass her husband systematically.|$|E
5|$|Between April 4, 1960, and October 25, 1962, {{including}} {{during the}} critical time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Missile Crisis, Chaffee flew 82 missions over Cuba, sometimes {{up to three}} per day, and achieved over 100 flight hours each month. Some of these trips included shuttling three men per plane {{back and forth to}} Guantanamo Bay, including the pilot, co-pilot, and the photographer. He was awarded the Air Medal.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 December 1988, Angola, Cuba, and South Africa {{signed the}} Tripartite Accord in New York, {{arranging}} for <b>the</b> retreat <b>of</b> South African and Cuban troops within 30months, and <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 10-year-old UN Security Council Resolution 435 for <b>the</b> independence <b>of</b> Namibia. <b>The</b> <b>Cuban</b> intervention, {{for a short}} time, turned Cuba into a [...] "global player" [...] in <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War. Their presence helped the MPLA retain control over large parts of Angola, and their military actions are also credited with helping secure Namibia's independence. <b>The</b> withdrawal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cubans</b> ended 13years <b>of</b> foreign military presence in Angola. At the same time, Cuba removed its troops from <b>the</b> Republic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Congo and Ethiopia.|$|R
50|$|Essence <b>of</b> Decision: Explaining <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Missile Crisis is an {{analysis}} by political scientist Graham T. Allison, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1962 <b>Cuban</b> Missile Crisis. Allison used the crisis {{as a case study}} for future studies into governmental decision-making. The book became <b>the</b> founding study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> John F. Kennedy School of Government, and in doing so revolutionized <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> international relations.|$|R
25|$|Three {{women were}} cited for an {{interview}} in downtown Buenos Aires, proposed a job opportunity that involved establishing a solid and stable link with <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> delegates, all accepted. They would be paid almost the same money they earned at their previous jobs, plus a few honoraries for the services provided. During a week, the agents were taught basic intelligence theories and practices, they observed photographs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cubans</b> {{they were going to}} 'mark', and they had time to elaborate complex backstories for their supposed identities.|$|R
5|$|In 1987, Payá {{founded the}} Christian Liberation Movement (MCL), {{which called for}} nonviolent civil disobedience against the rule <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Communist Party. The group advocates for civil liberties and freedom for {{political}} prisoners. He also began a magazine for Catholics titled People of God (Pueblo de Dios), calling for Christians to lead the struggle for human rights. However, the magazine was shut down the following year by Cuba's bishops under government pressure. Payá attempted {{to run for the}} National Assembly of People's Power (NAPP) in 1992, but was not allowed to stand.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, a {{new species}} of chewing louse, Psittacobrosus bechsteini, was {{described}} based on a dead specimen discovered on a museum skin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> macaw. It {{is thought to have}} been unique to this species, and is therefore an example of coextinction. The feather mite species Genoprotolichus eurycnemis and Distigmesikya extincta have also been reported from Cuban macaw skins, the latter new to science.|$|E

Truman stayed {{when he received}} the 1944 Democratic vice presidential nomination and where Dwight D. Eisenhower heard the news of his first-ballot 1952 Republican presidential nomination. In all, guests have included at least 12 U.S. presidents: Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Jimmy Carter. During Kennedy's visit he was informed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Missile Crisis.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the hostility}} between the U.S. and Cuba, the Americans {{regarded}} such an air by <b>the</b> <b>Cubans</b> as a defeat {{which could not}} be accepted. The U.S. assumed that the USSR was behind <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> interference. On 9 December Ford asked the Soviets to suspend the airlift, still assuming it was a Soviet-run operation. The Americans also depicted the motivations and timings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cubans</b> differently: They claimed that South Africa had to intervene after Cuba sent troops in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MPLA and that the war in Angola was a major new challenge to US power by an expansionist Moscow newly confident following communist victories in Vietnam War. Only years later it became clear to them, that <b>the</b> <b>Cubans</b> acted on their own behalf.|$|R
25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Cubans</b> {{launched}} their War of Independence against Spain in 1895, Machado joined the rebel forces {{and rose to}} <b>the</b> rank <b>of</b> brigadier general. He was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> youngest <b>Cuban</b> generals in <b>the</b> war. He fought in the middle provinces.|$|R
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{behaviour}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> macaw and its extinct Caribbean relatives. Gundlach reported that it vocalised loudly like its Central American relatives and that it lived in pairs or families. Its speech imitation abilities were reportedly inferior to those of other parrots. Nothing {{is known about}} its breeding habits or its eggs, but one reported nest was a hollow in a palm.|$|E
5|$|Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas (29 February 1952– 22 July 2012) was a Cuban {{political}} activist. A Roman Catholic, {{he founded}} the Christian Liberation Movement in 1987 to oppose the one-party rule <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> Communist Party. He attracted international attention for organizing a petition drive known as the Varela Project, in which 25,000 signatories petitioned the Cuban government to guarantee {{freedom of speech and}} freedom of assembly as well as to institute a multi-party democracy. In recognition of his work, he received the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize and People in Need's Homo Homini Award.|$|E
5|$|The {{extinction}} date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> macaw is uncertain. Gundlach's sightings in the Zapata Swamp in the 1850s and Zappey's second-hand {{report of}} a pair on Isla de la Juventud in 1864 are the last reliable accounts. In 1886, Gundlach reported that he believed birds persisted in southern Cuba, which led Greenway {{to suggest that the}} species survived until 1885. Parrots are often among the first species to be exterminated from a given locality, especially islands.|$|E
