50|$|Because of {{its global}} range and large payload of {{approximately}} five tons, the reliable R-7 {{was not only}} effective as a strategic delivery system for nuclear warheads, but also as an excellent basis for a space vehicle. The United States' announcement in July 1955 of its plan to launch a satellite during the International Geophysical Year greatly benefited Korolev in persuading Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to support his plans in January 1956, in order to surpass the Americans. Plans were approved for Earth-orbiting satellites (Sputnik) to gain knowledge of space, and four unmanned military reconnaissance satellites, Zenit. Further planned developments called for a manned Earth <b>orbit</b> <b>flight</b> by 1964 and an unmanned lunar mission at an earlier date.|$|E

50|$|The CSM was {{initially}} designed to return all three astronauts from {{the lunar surface}} on a direct-descent mission which would not use a separate Lunar Module, and thus had no provisions for docking with another spacecraft.

The Apollo 1 flight was cancelled after a cabin fire killed the entire crew and destroyed the Command Module during a launch rehearsal test. Corrections of the problems which caused the fire were applied to the Block II spacecraft, which was used for all manned missions.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} pushbroom scan sensor, the Multispectral Resource Sampler (MRS), {{being developed}} by NASA for a future earth <b>orbiting</b> <b>flight</b> is presented.

The four arrays are aligned on a common focal surface requiring no beamsplitters, thus causing a spatial separation on the ground which requires computer processing to register the bands. Along track pointing permits stereo coverage at variable base/height ratios and atmospheric correction experiments, while across track pointing will provide repeat coverage, from a Landsat-type orbit, of every 1 to 3 days. The MRS {{can be used for}} experiments in crop discrimination and status, rock discrimination, land use classification, and forestry...|$|R
