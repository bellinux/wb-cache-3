5|$|Because Perl is an {{interpreted}} language, it {{can give}} problems when efficiency is critical; in such situations, {{the most critical}} routines can be written in other languages (such as C), which can be connected to Perl via simple Inline modules <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> complex but flexible XS mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Later it was redefined as a stem-based taxon, {{including}} all animals {{more closely related}} to Abelisaurus (<b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> complete Carnotaurus) than to Noasaurus. The node-based definition would not include animals like Rugops or Ilokelesia, which are thought to be more basal than Abelisaurus and would be included by a stem-based definition. Within Abelisauridae is the subgroup Carnotaurinae, and among carnotaurines, Aucasaurus and Carnotaurus are united in Carnotaurini.|$|E
5|$|One {{consequence}} of this fact appears in the bit-reversed ordering of integer data types used by some computer algorithms, such as the Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform. This ordering has the property that the farther to the left the first 1 occurs in a number's binary expansion, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> times it is divisible by 2, the sooner it appears. Zero's bit reversal is still zero; it can be divided by 2 any number of times, and its binary expansion does not contain any 1s, so it always comes first.|$|E

5|$|Szilárd {{teamed up}} with Fermi {{to build a nuclear}} reactor from natural uranium at Columbia University, where they were {{fortunate}} in having a sympathetic head of the physics department in George B. Pegram. At the time there was disagreement about whether it was uranium-235, which made up less than 1% of natural uranium, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> abundant uranium-238 isotope, as Fermi maintained, that was primarily responsible for fission. Fermi and Szilárd conducted a series of experiments, and concluded that a chain reaction in natural uranium could be possible if they could find a suitable neutron moderator. They found that the hydrogen atoms in water slowed neutrons, but tended to capture them. Szilárd then suggested using carbon as a moderator. They now needed large quantities of carbon and uranium to create a reactor. Szilárd was convinced that they would succeed if only they could get the materials.|$|E

25|$|The actual {{societies}} {{which would}} be encountered in a game depends on the play style; some societies are more suited for more light-hearted games (Zap-style, or the lighter end of Classic), whereas others represent a more serious threat to Alpha Complex {{and are therefore more}} suitable for Straight <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> dark sort of Classic games.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{recreation}} centre at Phosphate Hill operated by South Australian-based CASA Leisure Pty Ltd. There {{is also a}} taxi service.

25|$|The Algonquins are {{indigenous}} {{inhabitants of}} North America who speak the Algonquin language, a divergent dialect of the Ojibwe language, {{which is part}} of the Algonquian language family. Culturally and linguistically, they are closely related to the Odawa and Ojibwe, with whom they form the larger Anicinàpe (Anishinaabe) grouping. The Algonquin people call themselves Omàmiwinini (plural: Omàmiwininiwak) <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> generalised name of Anicinàpe.|$|E
25|$|Some {{speculate}} that {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} is provoked by repetitive movement and manipulating activities and that the exposure can be cumulative. It has also been stated that symptoms are commonly exacerbated by forceful and repetitive use of the hand and wrists in industrial occupations, but it is unclear as to whether this refers to pain (which may not be due to carpal tunnel syndrome) <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> typical numbness symptoms.|$|E

25|$|The {{condition}} is often treated with hormones, particularly as abnormal uterine bleeding commonly {{occurs in the}} early and late menstrual years when contraception is also sought. Usually, oral combined contraceptive or progesterone only pills may be taken for a few months, but for longer-term treatment the alternatives of injected Depo Provera <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> recent progesterone releasing IntraUterine System (IUS) may be used. Fibroids may respond to hormonal treatment, {{and if they do}} not, then surgical removal may be required.|$|E
25|$|The Jesus Fellowship {{operates}} {{much like}} the house church movements, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> radical elements of the larger, more conventional churches. It was affected by the Charismatic Movement of the late 1960s and early 70s, and influenced by the Jesus People movement in the USA. According to William Kay, Stanton was highly influenced by Arthur Wallis's book In the Day of Thy Power, and associated {{with a number of}} the early leaders within the British New Church movement.|$|E
25|$|In the UK it {{was only}} {{available}} as the lavishly equipped SC100 GX, while in other countries it was also offered as a CX <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> luxurious CX-G. The GX, with a cigar lighter, reclining front seats, and independent all-round suspension, sold for £2,400 upon introduction (the slightly larger Alto of the same period sold for £3375). The marketing campaign was further helped by an enthusiastic owner, the late LJK Setright, long-time CAR magazine columnist. Other markets included the Netherlands, Hong Kong, South Africa, New Zealand and several Latin American countries.|$|E

25|$|There are {{an array}} of {{suggested}} routes that teams may take. After setting off from Goodwood {{or one of the}} other Western European start points (including France, Italy, and Spain), participants then generally proceed to a launch party in Prague where they converge. Typical routes then head for Moscow, Kiev or Istanbul, though teams have travelled as far north as the Arctic Circle and as far south as Iran, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan. Teams taking the Ukraine/Russia route <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> southerly Turkey and Iran route often converge at Samarkand, Uzbekistan before proceeding north-east for Mongolia.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} tekton could equally mean a highly skilled craftsman in wood <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> prestigious metal, perhaps running a workshop with several employees, and noted sources recording the shortage of skilled artisans at the time. Geza Vermes has stated that the terms 'carpenter' and 'son of a carpenter' {{are used in the}} Jewish Talmud to signify a very learned man, and he suggests that a description of Joseph as 'naggar' (a carpenter) could indicate that he was considered wise and highly literate in the Torah.|$|E
25|$|Land-based and {{near-shore}} facilities offer {{three main}} advantages over those located in deep water. Plants constructed {{on or near}} land do not require sophisticated mooring, lengthy power cables, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> extensive maintenance associated with open-ocean environments. They can be installed in sheltered areas {{so that they are}} relatively safe from storms and heavy seas. Electricity, desalinated water, and cold, nutrient-rich seawater could be transmitted from near-shore facilities via trestle bridges or causeways. In addition, land-based or near-shore sites allow plants to operate with related industries such as mariculture or those that require desalinated water.|$|E
50|$|Locally, walks vary in length: short {{distances}} {{of three to}} four miles (6 km); a medium range of five to six miles (10 km), or seven to nine miles (14 km); <b>or</b> for <b>the</b> <b>more</b> experienced ramblers, ten to fifteen miles (24 km).|$|R
