It uses anthropometry to calculate aortic and pulmonary valve diameters and CSAs, allowing right-sided and left-sided Q measurements. In comparison to the echocardiographic method, USCOM significantly improves reproducibility and increases sensitivity of the detection of changes in flow. Real-time, automatic tracing of the Doppler flow profile allows beat-to-beat right-sided and left-sided Q measurements, simplifying operation and reducing the time of acquisition compared to conventional echocardiography. USCOM has been validated from 0.12 l/min to 18.7 l/min in new-born babies, children and adults. The method can be applied with equal accuracy to patients of all ages {{for the development of}} physiologically rational haemodynamic protocols. USCOM is the only method of cardiac output measurement to have achieved equivalent accuracy to the implantable flow probe. This accuracy has ensured high levels of clinical use in conditions including sepsis, heart failure and hypertension.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use {{of cardiac}} <b>output</b> <b>monitoring</b> may improve patient {{outcomes}} after major surgery. However, {{little is known}} about the use of this technology across nations. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a previously published observational study. Patients aged 16 years and over undergoing major non-cardiac surgery in a 7 -day period in April 2011 were included into this analysis. The objective is to describe prevalence and type of cardiac <b>output</b> <b>monitoring</b> used in major surgery in Europe. RESULTS: Included in the analysis were 12, 170 patients from the surgical services of 426 hospitals in 28 European nations. One thousand four hundred and sixteen patients (11. 6 %) were exposed to cardiac <b>output</b> <b>monitoring,</b> and 2343 patients (19. 3 %) received a central venous catheter. Patients with higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores were more frequently exposed to cardiac <b>output</b> <b>monitoring</b> (ASA I and II, 643 patients [8. 6 %]; ASA III-V, 768 patients [16. 2 %]; p < 0. 01) and central venous catheter (ASA I and II, 874 patients [11. 8 %]; ASA III-V, 1463 patients [30. 9 %]; p < 0. 01). In elective surgery, 990 patients (10. 8 %) were exposed to cardiac <b>output</b> <b>monitoring,</b> in urgent surgery 252 patients (11. 7 %) and in emergency surgery 173 patients (19. 8 %). A central venous catheter was used in 1514 patients (16. 6 %) undergoing elective, in 480 patients (22. 2 %) undergoing urgent and in 349 patients (39. 9 %) undergoing emergency surgery. Nine hundred sixty patients (7. 9 %) were monitored using arterial waveform analysis, 238 patients (2. 0 %) using oesophageal Doppler ultrasound, 55 patients (0. 5 %) using a pulmonary artery catheter and 44 patients (2. 0 %) using other technologies. Across nations, cardiac <b>output</b> <b>monitoring</b> use varied from 0. 0 % (0 / 249 patients) to 27. 5 % (19 / 69 patients), whilst central venous catheter use varied from 5. 6 % (7 / 125 patients) to 43. 2 % (16 / 37 patients). CONCLUSIONS: One in ten patients undergoing major surgery is exposed to cardiac <b>output</b> <b>monitoring</b> whilst one in five receives a central venous catheter. The use of both technologies varies widely across Europe. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT 01203605. Date of registration: 15. 09. 2010...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES:: The {{ultrasonic}} cardiac <b>output</b> <b>monitor</b> is a non-invasive, quantitative {{method for}} measuring and monitoring cardiovascular hemodynamic parameters in patients. The aims {{of this study}} were first to establish reference ranges for cardiovascular indices measured by the ultrasonic cardiac <b>output</b> <b>monitor</b> in Chinese children aged 12 - 18 yr, second to assess the interobserver reliability of the method, and third to compare these ranges with a Caucasian group from Australia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS:: This was a population-based cross-sectional cohort study of Chinese adolescents aged 12 - 18 yrs., performed in secondary schools in Hong Kong. INTERVENTIONS:: Ultrasonic cardiac <b>output</b> <b>monitor</b> scans were performed on each subject to measure stroke volume, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance together with standard oscillometric measurement of blood pressure and heart rate. Ultrasonic cardiac <b>output</b> <b>monitor</b> parameters were also standardized by deriving body surface area referenced indices. Normal ranges were defined as lying within two standard deviations {{on either side of the}} mean. To assess interobserver variability, a second, blinded operator repeated 17 % of scans. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: A total of 590 Chinese adolescents (49 % boys) were scanned. Normal ranges for cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume, stroke volume index, stroke volume resistance, and systemic vascular resistance index are presented. Males had a significantly higher mean stroke volume, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance index compared with females (p < 0. 05), but no significant differences were found for the indexed values. When compared with a group of 31 Australian Caucasian adolescents (71 % boys), Chinese adolescents have a significantly lower cardiac output and stroke volume (p < 0. 05), but these differences disappeared when adjusted for body surface area (i. e., stroke volume index, cardiac index, and systemic vascular resistance index). Interobserver variability of ultrasonic cardiac output monitor-derived stroke volume showed a coefficient of variation of 10. 2 %, a correlation coefficient of 0. 90 (95 % confidence interval 0. 85 - 0. 93), while Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean bias of 1. 5 % (95 % limits of agreement were - 19. 9 % to 23. 0 %).

Cardiac output was measured with the TruCCOMS continuous cardiac <b>output</b> <b>monitor</b> (Aortech International plc, Lanarkshire, UK), using triplicate cold bolus thermodilution as the criterion standard, at fixed time points during surgery and during dobutamine infusion. The two techniques were compared using linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Overall, the study device displayed a bias of 0. 4 l. min(- 1) with limits of agreement of + 2. 5 l. min(- 1) and - 1. 7 l. min(- 1). The study device failed to detect the change in cardiac output caused by dobutamine accurately (y = 0. 18 x + 0. 45; r(2) = 0. 13), with an error linearly related to the magnitude of the change measured.

The ECOM device was first evaluated in an animal study, which suggested this new technology was both promising and safe [11].

However, ECOM was convenient and consistent to monitor cardiac output continuously [13] and seemed able to track the direction of its changes under dynamic loading conditions [14]. Furthermore, SVV given by ECOM had the ability to predict fluid responsiveness with a good accuracy and discrimination [14].
