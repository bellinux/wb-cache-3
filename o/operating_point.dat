2500|$|There are, however, {{components}} of electrical circuits {{which do not}} obey Ohm's law; that is, their relationship between current and voltage (their I–V curve) is nonlinear (or non-ohmic). [...] An example is the p-n junction diode (curve at right). [...] As seen in the figure, the current does not increase linearly with applied voltage for a diode. [...] One can determine a value of current (I) for a given value of applied voltage (V) from the curve, but not from Ohm's law, since the value of [...] "resistance" [...] is not constant {{as a function of}} applied voltage. [...] Further, the current only increases significantly if the applied voltage is positive, not negative. [...] The ratio V/I for some point along the nonlinear curve is sometimes called the static, or chordal, or DC, resistance, but as seen in the figure the value of total V over total I varies depending on the particular point along the nonlinear curve which is chosen. [...] This means the [...] "DC resistance" [...] V/I at some point on the curve {{is not the same as}} what would be determined by applying an AC signal having peak amplitude ΔV volts or ΔI amps centered at that same point along the curve and measuring ΔV/ΔI.
