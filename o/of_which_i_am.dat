Like Hollister before her, Crane would eventually become Beebe's lover during the long expeditions that Beebe made without Elswyth's companionship. During this time Beebe was also forming a close friendship with Winnie-the-Pooh's creator A. A. Milne, who wrote of Half Mile Down [...] "I don't know which I envy you most: all those moral and physical qualities which you have and I lack, or all that wonder of a new world.

500|$|In the {{vicinity}} of Saint-Quentin on 2October, No.2 Squadron became the first AFC unit in Europe to see aerial combat when one of its patrols engaged some German two-seaters, which managed to escape. Because the AircoDH.5s in the squadron were handicapped as fighters by engine problems and low speed, the squadron was employed mainly in ground support duties. During the Battle of Cambrai that commenced on 20November 1917, Watt led his pilots on daring low-level bombing and strafing attacks against enemy fortifications and lines of communication. Their loss rate reached 30%, but morale remained high. After visiting the squadron, the Royal Flying Corps' Major General Hugh Trenchard described its airmen as [...] "really magnificent" [...] while Charles Bean, war correspondent and future editor of the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, commented on their [...] "remarkably high level of conduct and general tone". Six of Watt's officers were awarded the Military Cross for gallantry during the battle, prompting General Sir William Birdwood to send him a personal message of congratulation on 16December, declaring: [...] "...This is indeed a magnificent record for your squadron, and one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure everyone of you must rightly be extremely proud; I doubt if it has been beaten anywhere..." [...] By this time, No.2 Squadron had begun converting to Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, though it could achieve little in the winter months due to inclement weather. Watt himself, now almost forty, was beginning to show the strain of frontline command. Bean found him looking [...] "very worn" [...] and noticed him shivering even while seated {{in front of the}} mess hall fire.|$|E

[...] Mrs. Washington was an habitual communicant...I have been written to by many on that point, and have been obliged to answer them as I now do you." [...] This letter is one piece of evidence among many which are frequently cited in support of Washington's deist or even atheist beliefs. [...] Although Washington never received communion there, he attended services at Christ Church regularly for about 25 years. [...] (See also: George Washington and religion) ...|$|E

On 3 August Law spoke openly in the House of Commons, saying that [...] "the Government already know, but I give them now the assurance on behalf of the party <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> leader in this House, that in whatever steps they think it necessary to take for the honour and security of this country they can rely upon the unhesitating support of the Opposition".

2500|$|Deeply {{moved by}} {{encounters}} with Israeli and Arab soldiers, {{he left the}} country to write [...] "Lover Lover Lover".

Wahib grew up in a society where Holocaust denial was common, but visited Poland while serving in the IDF and was shocked, saying that [...] "there was something very powerful in the fact that I was standing on Polish soil, holding an Israeli flag and donning the uniform of the Israeli army, but this time from a position of power." [...] According to Wahib, there are quite a lot of Israeli Arabs who want to enlist, but do not do so since they don't know how this will be accepted by their environment. In regards to being a Muslim, Wahib explained that he believes in the Muslim faith, and will never abandon it, but believes that [...] "Zionism... is something that fully represents my sense of belonging to the State of Israel and to Israeli society, and the immense commitment I have to protecting and guarding the country <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> part." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 23, 1783, the State of New Jersey {{presented}} him {{with the use of}} an estate in Bergen County now known as Steuben House, which had been confiscated from Loyalist Jan Zabriskie in 1781.

Legislators initially conditioned the grant, requiring Steuben to [...] "hold, occupy and enjoy the said estate in person, and not by tenant." [...] Gen.

It also carried an actor named Édouard Angelo whom she had selected to serve as her leading man, and, according to most accounts, her lover during the tour. From New York, she made a side trip to Menlo Park, where she met Thomas Edison, who made a brief recording of her reciting a verse from Phèdre [...] She crisscrossed the United States and Canada from Montreal and Toronto to Saint Louis and New Orleans, usually performing each evening, and departing immediately after the performance. She gave countless press interviews and in Boston posed for photos {{on the back of}} a dead whale. She was condemned as immoral by the Bishop of Montreal and by the Methodist press, which only increased ticket sales. She performed Phedre six times and La Dame Aux Camilias (which Jarrett had renamed [...] "Camille" [...] to make it easier for Americans to pronounce) 65 times. On 3 May 1881, she gave her final performance of Camelias in New York. Throughout her life, she always insisted on being paid in cash. When Bernhardt returned to France, she brought with her a chest filled with $194,000 in gold coins [...] She described the result of her trip to her friends: [...] "I crossed the oceans, carrying my dream of art in myself, and the genius of my nation triumphed.
