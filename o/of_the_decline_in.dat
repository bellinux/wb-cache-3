50|$|Some conservationists {{blame the}} {{reductions}} in monarch overwintering numbers in Mexico on <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> milkweeds in <b>the</b> Midwestern region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States. 167 {{million acres of}} monarch habitat has been lost since 1996. These conservationists argue that the reduction in milkweed habitat in agricultural regions of North America is a major cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> monarchs that reach Mexico. However, other top researchers doubt this claim, {{because it is not}} consistent with data collected by several long-term butterfly monitoring programs in the United States. The data from these programs do not show evidence that <b>the</b> numbers <b>of</b> breeding adult monarchs has <b>declined</b> since <b>the</b> 1990s. Despite this evidence, some conservationists cite <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> pesticides and herbicides as a cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> overwintering monarchs. They state that prior to <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> genetically altered corn and soybeans, milkweed was common in the crop fields. The connection between <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> GMO crops and <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> numbers <b>of</b> overwintering monarchs has been called 'suggestive but not conclusive', as there are other factors such as deforestation and weather events that could be the cause. Milkweed habitat is also destroyed by <b>the</b> expansion <b>of</b> urban and suburban areas.|$|R
5|$|Other factors {{thought to}} affect this species include {{predation}} by introduced mammals, such as cats and foxes, changes to water quality at breeding sites, herbicide use, {{and loss of}} habitat through the destruction of wetlands. The amphibian chytrid fungus appears to have led to at least some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> numbers, but {{the relative importance of}} the various factors is unclear. The frogs may have become more susceptible to chytrid rather than the fungus being more common. The genetic pool of the frogs {{has been found to be}} relatively small, attributed to habitat destruction, which has confined the smaller groups of frogs to isolated pockets and increased the incidence of inbreeding. This has led to proposals for frog populations to be mixed by human intervention in an attempt to reduce negative genetic effects and boost survival rates.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the first}} award of the GC to an Australian in 1942 {{and the final}} bestowal to Constable Michael Kenneth Pratt in 1978, 14 Australians were {{directly}} decorated with the medal. Of these, nine were awarded to military personnel and five to civilians. Eight of the medals were awarded posthumously. At {{the time of the}} institution of the GC, living recipients of the Empire Gallantry Medal automatically became recipients of the new award, and were required to return their previous medal; two Australians became GC holders through this method. In 1971, the British Government announced that living recipients of the Albert Medal and Edward Medal would henceforth be recipients of the GC with the option of exchanging their insignia for that of the GC. The decision for such an action was the result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the status and significance of the two awards, leading recipients to feel they were not receiving the recognition they were due. Of the 27 Australian holders of the Albert Medal, six were living at the time and all opted to exchange their insignia for the GC. None of the eight Australians awarded the Edward Medal were alive in 1971, and thus no Australian became a recipient of the GC through this exchange. Including exchange awards, a total of 22 Australians were decorated with the GC.|$|E

Despite only narrowly missing out on the League title in the 1970–71 season in controversial circumstances, the next twelve years proved to be a disaster for the club both on and off the field. On 25 April 1971, Rovers met Cork Hibs in Dalymount in a League play-off watched by 28,000 people. Their pre-match buildup was thrown into disarray when players and directors clashed over win bonuses. Hibs won the play-off 3–1. The next season, the Cunninghams, now under the control of sons Arthur and Des, sold the club to three brothers from Dublin; Paddy, Barton and Louis Kilcoyne. The Kilcoynes had witnessed decades of huge attendances at Irish football games and sought to take over the club primarily for business reasons. However, within the space of five years, the large crowds disappeared from Irish football stadia and combined with the demise of Drumcondra and Cork Hibs, the decline in fortunes of a number of top clubs and the lack of action by the FAI, the League of Ireland was plunged into a drastic decline.|$|E

5|$|As of April 2008, 38 {{species are}} {{considered}} by the IUCN to be near threatened or worse and therefore at risk of extinction. Antbirds are neither targeted by the pet trade nor {{large enough to be}} hunted; the principal cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> antbird species is habitat loss. The destruction or modification of forests has several effects on different species of antbirds. The fragmentation of forests into smaller patches affects species that are averse to crossing gaps as small as roads. If these species become locally extinct in a fragment, this reluctance to cross unforested barriers makes their re-establishment unlikely. Smaller forest fragments are unable to sustain mixed-species feeding flocks, leading to local extinctions. Another risk faced by antbirds in fragmented habitat is increased nest predation. An unplanned experiment in fragmentation occurred on Barro Colorado Island, a former hill in Panama that became an isolated island during the flooding caused by the creation of the Panama Canal. Numerous species of antbird formerly resident in the area were extirpated, in no small part due to increased levels of nest predation on the island. While the species lost from Barro Colorado are not globally threatened, they illustrate the vulnerability of species in fragmented habitats and help explain the declines of some species. The majority of threatened species have very small natural ranges. Some are also extremely poorly known; for example the Rio de Janeiro antwren is known only from a single specimen collected in 1982, although there have been unconfirmed reports since 1994 and it is currently listed as critically endangered. Additionally, new species are discovered at regular intervals; the Caatinga antwren was described in 2000, the acre antshrike in 2004, the sincorá antwren in 2007, and the description of a relative of the Paraná antwren discovered in 2005 in the outskirts of São Paulo is being prepared. While not yet scientifically described, conservation efforts have already been necessary, as the site of discovery was set out to be flooded to form a reservoir. Consequently, 72 individuals were captured and transferred to another locality.|$|E

25|$|One notable {{consequence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> use of {{the second}} person singular pronouns thou, thy, and thee is the obfuscation of certain sociocultural elements of Early Modern English texts, such as many character interactions in Shakespeare's plays, which were mostly written from 1589 to 1613.

25|$|Due to the {{influences}} of public sector reforms, several authors (Kezar and Eckel 2004; Lapworth 2004; Middlehurst 2004) point out that next {{to the concept of}} shared and participative governance a new form of governance has emerged, i.e. the notion of corporate governance of institutions, that has increasingly become a more dominant approach to tertiary management. According to Lapworth, the rise of the notion of corporate governance and the decline of the shared or consensual governance can be seen to be a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> academic participation, a growing tendency towards managerialism and the new environment where the universities are operating.|$|E
