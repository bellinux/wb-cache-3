5|$|In 1968, Stafford {{stopped by}} Shepard's office {{and told him}} that an <b>otologist</b> in Los Angeles had {{developed}} a cure for Ménière's disease. Shepard flew to Los Angeles, where he met with Dr. William F. House. House proposed to open Shepard's mastoid bone and make a tiny hole in the endolymphatic sac. A small tube was inserted to drain excess fluid. The surgery was conducted in early 1969 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Los Angeles, where Shepard checked in under the pseudonym of Victor Poulos. The surgery was successful, and he was restored to full flight status on May 7, 1969.|$|E

40|$|In {{vestibular}} examinations anomalies in the saccade {{and smooth}} pursuit tests {{as well as}} the fixation suppression after caloric stimulation might indicate central lesions in the vestibular system. Additionally, a high gain in the torsion test is suspicious of cerebellar dysfunction. In this study, 141 patients out of 973 had {{at least one of these}} anomalies. For 125 patients we were able to compare the initial findings in the vestibular examination with the final diagnosis by <b>otologists,</b> neurologists and general practitioners. The complaints of 37. 6 % of the patients with these electronystagmographic (ENG) anomalies appeared to be of central origin. Abnormal saccades, an abnormal smooth pursuit, and an elevated gain in the torsion test were not independently diagnostic for central vestibular disease. The fixation suppression index appeared to be lower for subjects with peripheral vestibular disease. <b>Otologists</b> more often referred their patients to a neurologist if the fixation index was elevated.
