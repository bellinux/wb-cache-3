5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{success of}} the pressurized water reactor, he wrote, was due less to any superior characteristics of water, but rather to the decision to power the prototype of the Mark I submarine thermal reactor with a pressurized version of the Materials Testing Reactor at Oak Ridge. Once pressurized water was established, <b>other</b> <b>possibilities</b> became too expensive to pursue, but Weinberg remained interested in <b>other</b> <b>possibilities.</b> According to Freeman Dyson, {{he was the only}} nuclear pioneer who supported the wide universe of reactor designs.|$|E

5|$|Chopin's {{disease and}} the cause of his death have since been a matter of discussion. His death {{certificate}} gave the cause as tuberculosis, and his physician, Jean Cruveilhier, was then the leading French authority on this disease. <b>Other</b> <b>possibilities</b> have been advanced including cystic fibrosis, cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. In 2017, an autopsy was performed on Chopin's preserved heart, which confirmed that a rare case of pericarditis, caused by complications from chronic tuberculosis, was the likely cause of his death.|$|E
5|$|Euchambersia was a {{small and}} short-snouted therocephalian, {{possessing}} large canines as {{is typical of the}} group. However, it is notable among therocephalians for possessing ridges on its canines and a large indentation {{in the side of the}} skull. Under the erroneous assumption that the canines are grooved instead of ridged, it has been proposed that these structures supported a venom delivery mechanism. More recently, the internal structure of the skull of Euchambersia has been used as stronger evidence in favour of the hypothesis that it was venomous; <b>other</b> <b>possibilities,</b> such as the indentation supporting some sort of sensory organ, still remain plausible.|$|E
5|$|Leopold Clement's younger brother, Francis Stephen, {{was invited}} to Vienna. Even though Francis Stephen was his {{favourite}} candidate for Maria Theresa's hand, the Emperor considered <b>other</b> <b>possibilities.</b> Religious differences prevented him from arranging his daughter's marriage to the Calvinist prince Frederick of Prussia. In 1725, he betrothed her to Charles of Spain and her sister, Maria Anna, to Philip of Spain. Other European powers compelled him to renounce the pact he had made with the Queen of Spain, Elisabeth Farnese. Maria Theresa, who had become close to Francis Stephen, was relieved.|$|E

5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>possibilities</b> exist, as well. For example, {{immunohistochemistry}} usually utilizes an antibody {{to one or}} more proteins {{of interest}} that are conjugated to enzymes yielding either luminescent or chromogenic signals that can be compared between samples, allowing for localization information. Another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose (or other material) gradients using isopycnic centrifugation. While this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest, it does increase the likelihood, and is more amenable to large-scale studies.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of a massive companion brings many <b>other</b> <b>possibilities.</b> If Eta Carinae A was rapidly stripped of its outer layers, {{it might be a}} less massive WC- or WO-type star when core collapse was reached.

This supernova type is thought to be the originator of certain classes of gamma ray bursts, but models predict they occur only normally in less massive stars.|$|E

Many historians are convinced that the Tribal Hidage originated from Mercia, which dominated southern Anglo-Saxon England until the start of the 9th century, but others have argued that the text was Northumbrian in origin.|$|E

5|$|At the convention, held August 5–8, Agnew {{abandoned}} his favorite son status, placing Nixon's name in nomination. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination {{on the first}} ballot. In the discussions that followed about a running mate, Nixon kept his counsel while various party factions thought they could influence his choice: Strom Thurmond, the senator from South Carolina, told a party meeting that he held a veto on the vice presidency. It was evident that Nixon wanted a centrist, though there was little enthusiasm when he first proposed Agnew, and <b>other</b> <b>possibilities</b> were discussed. Some party insiders thought that Nixon had privately settled on Agnew early on, and that the consideration of other candidates {{was little more than}} a charade. On August 8, after a final meeting of advisers and party leaders, Nixon declared that Agnew was his choice, and shortly afterwards announced his decision to the press. Delegates formally nominated Agnew for the vice presidency later that day, before adjourning.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, {{scientists}} at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory claimed the discovery of element 102, now called nobelium. At the same time, they also attempted to synthesize element 103 by bombarding the same curium target used with nitrogen-14 ions. A follow-up on this experiment was not performed, as the target was destroyed. Eighteen tracks were noted, with decay energy around (9±1)MeV and half-life around s; the Berkeley team noted that while the cause could be the production of an isotope of element 103, <b>other</b> <b>possibilities</b> could not be ruled out. While the data agrees reasonably with that later discovered for 257Lr (alpha decay energy 8.87MeV, half-life 0.6s), the evidence obtained in this experiment fell {{far short of the}} strength required to conclusively demonstrate the synthesis of element 103. Later, in 1960, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory attempted to synthesize the element by bombarding 252Cf with 10B and 11B. The results of this experiment were not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{causes of}} tics (not related to {{inherited}} Tourette syndrome) are {{commonly referred to}} as tourettism. Dystonias, choreas, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis for Tourette syndrome. Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and stereotypic movement disorder; Sydenham's chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Wilson's disease, and tuberous sclerosis. <b>Other</b> <b>possibilities</b> include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may also be confused with Tourette syndrome. Most of these conditions are rarer than tic disorders, and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out, without medical or screening tests.|$|E

5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>possibilities</b> to {{synthesize}} nuclei {{on the island}} of stability include quasifission (partial fusion followed by fission) of a massive nucleus. Such nuclei tend to fission, expelling doubly magic or nearly doubly magic fragments such as calcium-40, tin-132, lead-208, or bismuth-209. Recently {{it has been shown that}} the multi-nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei (such as uranium and curium) might be used {{to synthesize}} the neutron-rich superheavy nuclei located at the island of stability, although formation of the lighter elements nobelium or seaborgium is more favored. One last possibility to synthesize isotopes near the island is to use controlled nuclear explosions to create a neutron flux high enough to bypass the gaps of instability at 258–260Fm and at mass number 275 (atomic numbers 104 to 108), mimicking the r-process in which the actinides were first produced in nature and the gap of instability around radon bypassed. Some such isotopes (especially 291Cn and 293Cn) may even have been synthesized in nature, but would have decayed away far too quickly (with half-lives of only thousands of years) and be produced in far too small quantities (about 10−12 the abundance of lead) to be detectable as primordial nuclides today outside cosmic rays.|$|E
5|$|The same {{building}} {{was also the}} site of the discovery in 1918 of a bronze bust of outstanding quality depicting Cato the Younger. One of the most notable artefacts discovered at Volubilis, it is now on display in the Archaeological Museum in Rabat. It was still on its original pedestal when it was found by archaeologists. The bust has been dated to the time of Nero or Vespasian and may be a copy of a bust created in Cato's lifetime or shortly thereafter. Its inscription identifies its subject as the orator. Another outstanding bust, depicting a Hellenistic prince, was discovered in a bakery across the street. It seems to have been made {{at the same time as}} the Cato bust and may well have come from the House of Venus, where an empty pedestal in another room suggests that the Cato had a companion piece. The bust, which is also on display in Rabat, is usually identified as Juba II but <b>other</b> <b>possibilities</b> include Hiero II of Syracuse, Cleomenes III of Sparta, Juba I or Hannibal.|$|E
