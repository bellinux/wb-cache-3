25|$|Marine mussels {{are usually}} found {{clumping}} together on wave-washed rocks, each {{attached to the}} rock by its byssus. The clumping habit helps hold the mussels firm against {{the force of the}} waves. At low tide mussels {{in the middle of a}} clump will undergo less water loss because of water capture by the <b>other</b> <b>mussels.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{species is}} {{differentiated}} from <b>other</b> <b>mussels</b> by its relatively small size and inflated shape, {{as well as}} by the greenish colour of its outer periostracal layer. The shell has radiating reddish lines on its posterior surfaces, small internal teeth on the dorsal edge posterior to the ligament, and small ribs anterior to the umbones. It can grow up to 30mm in length. It is also known for its relatively fast growth and has a maximum lifetime of about two years.|$|E
50|$|The {{shells of}} these mussels are very thick, and unlike many <b>other</b> <b>mussels,</b> there are bumps on the shell surface running {{down from the}} hinge of the shell to the outside edges. It is the {{patterns}} of these bumps that help to distinguish the winged mapleleaf from many <b>other</b> <b>mussels</b> that look very similar in appearance.|$|E
50|$|This {{shellfish}} is economically {{important to}} New Zealand. It differs from <b>other</b> <b>mussel</b> species {{in that it}} has dark brown/green shells with green lips around the edges, and only has one adductor muscle. It {{is also one of}} the largest mussel species, reaching 240 mm in length.|$|R
50|$|Hexaplex fulvescens {{are active}} predators on <b>other</b> mollusks (<b>mussels,</b> oysters and clams). They {{lay their eggs}} in {{capsules}} attached under rocks.|$|R
50|$|The {{species was}} first noticed to be declining in populations {{some time after}} Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Ivan hit the Southeastern region of the United States in the early 1990s. Although the {{landscape}} was changed due to the high winds and heavy rain of the hurricanes, naturally occurring storms do not threaten the Appalachian elktoe. When humans tamper with the naturally occurring state of the streams however, {{it is very difficult}} for the Appalachian elktoe, as well as <b>other</b> <b>mussel</b> species, to remain healthy.|$|R
50|$|Like <b>other</b> <b>mussels,</b> {{this species}} {{releases}} larvae called glochidia that lodge in the gills of fish {{to develop into}} juvenile mussels. The host fish for this species include Etheostoma edwini (brown darter), Percina nigrofasciata (blackbanded darter), Gambusia holbrooki (eastern mosquitofish), and Poecilia reticulata (guppy).|$|E
50|$|California mussels {{continue}} to be harvested as sources of both food and bait {{up and down the}} Pacific Coast of North America. The flesh of the California mussel tends to be orange in color. They can be baked, boiled, or fried like <b>other</b> <b>mussels,</b> clams, and oysters.|$|E
50|$|Agricultural run-off {{has been}} {{identified}} as a significant threat to dwarf wedgemussel populations in Massachusetts, Maryland, and North Carolina. In 2001, more than 25 dwarf wedgemussels and hundreds of <b>other</b> <b>mussels</b> (including state-listed species) were killed in the Mill River, Massachusetts, by waste run-off from a small farm.|$|E

50|$|This {{species is}} yellow-green or greenish yellow in color. It can reach at least 35 years old. Like <b>other</b> <b>mussels,</b> it has larvae called glochidia that lodge in the gills of fish {{to develop into}} {{juvenile}} mussels.

50|$|Like most <b>other</b> <b>mussels</b> in the {{sensitive}} genus Epioblasma, this species experienced severe declines during industrialization due to pollution, siltation, habitat destruction.

50|$|Mutela is a genus of {{freshwater}} mussels, aquatic bivalve mollusks {{in the family}} Unionidae, the river mussels. Species in this genus have actual siphons, rather than unfused apertures, as do most <b>other</b> freshwater <b>mussels.</b>|$|R

50|$|This {{group of}} {{freshwater}} mussels is threatened primarily by habitat alteration as are <b>other</b> freshwater <b>mussels.</b> Dams, erosion, and pollution {{appear to be}} the primarily threats. Some workers recognize additional species not currently on the official list of recognized species.|$|R
50|$|This {{species was}} once common in some areas. It is now {{restricted}} for several reasons. Rivers {{throughout much of}} its range have been impounded. There {{has been an increase}} in silt, which the mussel cannot tolerate. Pollution of the waterways has led to the decline of this and <b>other</b> <b>mussels.</b> The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is a widespread threat.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{differentiated}} from <b>other</b> <b>mussels</b> by its relatively small size and inflated shape, {{as well as}} by the greenish colour of its outer periostracal layer.

50|$|When this mussel breeds it {{releases}} its larvae, termed glochidia, glued {{together in}} packets called conglutinates. The conglutinate has a sticky filament that adheres to the substrate {{to prevent it}} from being washed away. The conglutinate resembles a fly larva, or perhaps a fish egg, and it is appetizing to fish. Fish hosts such as the warrior darter (Etheostoma bellator), Tuskaloosa darter (Etheostoma douglasi), and blackbanded darter (Percina nigrofasciata) consume the conglutinates, degrading them and releasing the glochidia, which then lodge in the fishs gills as parasites. They develop into juvenile mussels and drop out of the fish to develop further elsewhere. Many <b>other</b> <b>mussels</b> in family Unionidae have a similar process.|$|E
40|$|The rock pocketbook, Arcidens confragosus (Say, 1829), is a {{freshwater}} <b>mussel,</b> distin-guished from <b>other</b> <b>mussel</b> species by a rhomboidal shell profile, high beaks, knobbed and double-looped beak sculptur-ing, folded disc sculpturing, {{olive green}} to black periostracum, compressed pseudocardinal teeth, and poorly developed lateral teeth (Burch 1975, Clarke 1981). The species occurs widely throughout the Mis-sissippi River and other Gulf Coast drain-ages (Johnson 1980), though usually at low abundances. To our knowledge, {{it has not}} been reported previously from Oklahoma, despite mussel surveys having been per-formed extensively throughout the state over nearly a century of time. Branson (1983) included A. confragosus among the species he covered because of its known occurrence near Oklahoma in Ozarkian and Gulf Coastal streams...|$|R
5000|$|Zebra mussels {{attach to}} most {{substrates}} including sand, silt, and harder substrates, but usually, juvenile mussels prefer harder, rockier substrates to which to attach. <b>Other</b> <b>mussel</b> species frequently represent {{the most stable}} objects in silty substrates, and zebra mussels attach to, and often kill these mussels. They build colonies on Native American unionid clams, reducing their ability to move, feed, and breed, eventually leading to their deaths. This {{has led to the}} near extinction of the unionid clams in Lake St. Clair and the western basin of Lake Erie. [...] This pattern is being repeated in Ireland, where zebra mussels have eliminated the two freshwater mussels from several waterways, including some lakes along the River Shannon in 1997.|$|R
5000|$|The {{species are}} entirely marine, found growing on rock, <b>other</b> algae, <b>mussels</b> or limpets and {{artificial}} substrata etc. from mid-littoral {{to at least}} 27 m depth. Many species are abundant in rock pools. [...] Polysiphonia lanosa is commonly found growing on Ascophyllum nodosum.|$|R
50|$|M. {{modiolus}} {{is found}} growing on hard substrates including shells and stones and the byssus threads of <b>other</b> <b>mussels.</b> Survival rates of young individuals are low {{but by the}} time they reach about 4 cm long, at an age of 4 years, individuals are too large and tough to be predated upon by starfish such as Asterias rubens, the whelk Buccinum undatum and crabs. Juveniles growing on byssus threads are more likely to survive than free living individuals and this results in the formation of cold-water reefs of mussels. These mostly occur in locations with fairly strong currents. The species is tolerant of low levels of oxygen and of a diminished quantity of the phytoplankton on which they feed. The boring sponge Cliona celata sometimes damages the shells of older individuals.|$|E
50|$|Elephant-ears {{typically}} breed once a year. Breeding seasons are short, lasting {{from either}} April through May or June to July. Both {{males and females}} reach sexual maturity at four to six years. Larvae stay in their mother's gills anywhere from {{a few weeks to}} a few months. Eventually, the offspring will attach to a host fish's fins or gills. After living parasitically on the host fish for several weeks, juvenile clams break free and fall to bottom of the river where they burrow and develop into adult mussels. The mussels will not likely move more than a few meters from this site throughout their lives. Elephant-ears are filter feeders, consuming primarily bacteria, protozoans, algae, and plankton. Common predators include otters, raccoons, muskrats, herons, egrets, and a variety of fish. Like <b>other</b> <b>mussels,</b> elephant-ears are thought to be long-lived, with lifespans from 20 to as long as 100 years.|$|E
50|$|Like many {{fresh water}} mussels, the Wavy-rayed lampmussel is {{extremely}} sensitive {{to changes in}} water quality. This includes chemical contaminants entering its habitat such as copper, ammonia and chloride, particularly during their glochidial and juvenile life phases. This, along with loss of habitat has caused a continuous decrease in the mussel's populations. Additionally, {{the introduction of the}} invasive Zebra Mussel has resulted in even greater reductions in population. By affixing themselves to hard surfaces the zebra mussels are in direct competition with wavy-rayed lampmussels, and impair their ability to feed, reproduce and move.Smaller population may also be affected by predation by muskrats. Like <b>other</b> <b>mussels,</b> other threats to the wavy-rayed lampmussel include: natural flow alterations, siltation, channel disturbance, point and non-point source pollution, and exotic species (including the aforementioned zebra mussel). Maintenance or establishment of vegetated riparian buffers can help protect mussel habitats from many of their threats.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{capacity}} of coast recovering after interrup-tion of pollution sources has been explored employing mussels as biomarkers. In an area polluted by sewage sludge in Puerto Madryn (Argentina), abnormally high cytogenetic records (micronuclei) had been {{detected in the}} mussel Mytilus edulis, even higher than those obtained in this and <b>other</b> <b>mussel</b> species (Brachydontes rodriguezi, Aulacomya atra atra, Perumytilus purpuratus) sampled from heavily polluted industrial areas, and much higher than those recorded in samples from unpolluted areas of the same region. Normal cytogenetic patterns were recovered in Puerto Madryn less than 1 year after cessation of sewage sludge discharges, without additional treatment of the affected area. This discovery opens the possibility of considering restored coastal areas for aquaculture purposes instead of endangering natural populations in virgin areas...|$|R
40|$|Freshwater mussels (Unionoida) show great {{variability}} in shell morphology {{which can be}} associated with differences in habitat, sex and/or parasite infection. Three unionid mussel species, (Anodonta anatina, Unio pictorum and Unio tumidus) were collected from two sites Lake Saravesi, (Laukaa) and Lake Kuivasjarvi, (Oulu), between May - October 2012. Intraspecific trends that were associated with the mussels’ sex and/or parasites infection were studied and observations were made on how sex and parasite infection could have a role in shells morphological characters/patterns. The study revealed a range of morphometric differences among and across populations, as well as, within and between species. The hypothesis that female growth would decrease relative to males at adult ages due to energetic cost of glochidium larvae production did not receive unequivocal support. In addition, the hypothesis of adult female shells being wider (more inflated) than that of males due to space requirements by carried glochidia was also supported only in A. anatina of Lake Kuivasjärvi but not in Lake Saravesi, or in <b>other</b> <b>mussel</b> species. Male A. anatina were higher than females in Lake Saravesi, but not in Lake Kuivasjärvi, or in <b>other</b> <b>mussel</b> species, except for U. pictorum, in which females were higher than males among the large individuals. Between species, A. anatina had the highest shell, followed by U. tumidus and U. pictorum, while U. tumidus had the widest shell, followed by U. pictorum and A. anatina. The hypothesis of trematode infected mussels being wider due to space requirements by growing parasites was supported partly: mussels infected by R. fennica were, indeed, wider than the uninfected individuals, but for mussels infected with R. campanula this pattern was not found. On the other hand, R. campanula–infected individuals were relatively longer (more elongated) than the uninfected mussels. This may indicate a parasite species specific interaction between parasitism and host mussel shell morphology...|$|R
50|$|Its {{reproductive}} {{cycle is}} typical of <b>other</b> freshwater <b>mussels,</b> requiring a host fish on which its larvae (glochidia) parasitize and metamorphose into juvenile mussels. The dwarf wedgemussel is not a long-lived species as compared to other freshwater mussels; life expectancy is estimated at 10 to 12 years (Michaelson and Neves 1995).|$|R
50|$|Practical {{underwater}} adhesion is {{an engineering}} challenge since current technology {{is unable to}} stick surface strongly underwater because of barriers such as hydration layers and contaminants on surfaces. However, marine mussels can stick easily and efficiently to surfaces underwater {{under the harsh conditions}} of the ocean. They use strong filaments to adhere to rocks in the inter-tidal zones of wave-swept beaches, preventing them from being swept away in strong sea currents. Mussel foot proteins attach the filaments to rocks, boats and practically any surface in nature including <b>other</b> <b>mussels.</b> These proteins contain a mix of amino acid residues which has been adapted specifically for adhesive purposes. Researchers from the University of California Santa Barbara borrowed and simplified chemistries that the mussel foot uses to overcome this engineering challenge of wet adhesion to create copolyampholytes, and one-component adhesive systems with potential for employment in nanofabrication protocols.|$|E
50|$|Like other {{freshwater}} mussels, {{this species}} releases larvae called glochidia, which must attach parasitically {{to a host}} organism, generally a fish, so they can develop into free-living juveniles. Some mussels release their glochidia inside a spongy, sticky mass called a conglutinate. The conglutinate sometimes resembles a prey item, such as a worm, which attracts the fish. When the fish bumps the conglutinate, it breaks apart and releases the glochidia, which attach to the fish. S. undulatus produces an interesting kind of conglutinate. It is whitish and rod-shaped, up to 7 millimeters long and contains around 12 glochidia. The glochidia of this species are larger than those of most <b>other</b> <b>mussels,</b> measuring up to almost 500 micrometers. The conglutinate moves by itself, making a pulsing motion. This {{may be caused by}} the swelling of the structure when it contacts the water. The motion helps to squeeze out the glochidia and it may help to attract fish hosts. Sometimes one of the glochidia will attach to a host while remaining attached to the conglutinate; in this case, the other glochidia in the structure may be dragged along with it and have an easier opportunity to parasitize the host.|$|E
30|$|The {{approach}} {{of this study}} aimed to validate consumer acceptance as a meaningful factor in market feasibility studies. In addition, it also aimed to investigate if mussels cultured in the open ocean could compete with <b>other</b> <b>mussels</b> currently available on the market. However, future market needs will ultimately decide the final viability of mussel open ocean aquaculture.|$|E
50|$|Like <b>other</b> {{freshwater}} <b>mussels,</b> {{this species}} releases its larvae, termed glochidia, {{into the water}} where they enter the bodies of fish as parasites to develop into juvenile mussels. Host fish species for this mussel include striped shiner (Luxilus chrysocephalus), redfin shiner (Lythrurus umbratilis), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), and brown madtom (Noturus phaeus).|$|R
50|$|A {{non-native}} invasive species, zebra mussels {{were originally}} {{native to the}} lakes of southeast Russia. In the 1990s they began colonizing the Great Lakes, and have since spread into streams and rivers nationwide. In some areas they completely cover the substrate, sometimes covering <b>other</b> freshwater <b>mussels.</b> They can grow so densely that they block pipelines, clogging water intakes of municipal water supplies and hydroelectric companies.|$|R
50|$|Like <b>other</b> {{freshwater}} <b>mussels,</b> {{this species}} reproduces by releasing its larvae, or glochidia, {{into the water}} where {{they make their way}} into the bodies of fish.
