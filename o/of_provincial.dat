5|$|Although French is an {{official}} language {{for the purposes}} of the legislature, legislation, and the courts, the Manitoba Act does not require it to be {{an official}} language for the purpose of the executive branch (except when performing legislative or judicial functions). Hence, Manitoba's government is not completely bilingual. The Manitoba French Language Services Policy of 1999 is intended to provide a comparable level <b>of</b> <b>provincial</b> government services in both official languages. According to the 2006 Census, 82.8 percent of Manitoba's population spoke only English, 3.2 percent spoke only French, 15.1 percent spoke both, and 0.9 percent spoke neither.|$|E

5|$|Dunderdale also {{announced}} soon after being sworn {{in that she}} wanted to end a year-long strike on the Burin Peninsula that involved 15 home care workers.

5|$|Macdonald {{consistently}} {{called for}} a more equitable redistribution of wealth, so that poorer provinces such as Nova Scotia, could share fully in Canada's prosperity. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald deserves credit for the introduction, in 1957, of an equalization scheme designed to enable poorer provinces to provide comparable levels of services to their citizens. Macdonald's advocacy <b>of</b> <b>provincial</b> autonomy however, fell victim to the centralizing tendencies of a post-war welfare state in which the federal government increasingly assumed greater control over national social programs.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald was {{considered}} one of his province's most eloquent political orators. He articulated a philosophy <b>of</b> <b>provincial</b> autonomy, arguing that poorer provinces needed a greater share of national tax revenues to pay for health, education and welfare. He contended that Nova Scotians were victims of a national policy that protected the industries of Ontario and Quebec with steep tariffs forcing people to pay higher prices for manufactured goods. It was no accident, Macdonald said, that Nova Scotia had gone from the richest province per capita before Canadian Confederation in 1867 to poorest by the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{completion}} of the Conestoga Parkway through Waterloo, Highway85 followed King Street north of Ottawa Street through Kitchener and Waterloo. Within the City of Waterloo, this former alignment is now maintained by the region as Regional Road15. Within the city of Kitchener, the road is simply known as King Street. The parkway was constructed between 1968 and 1977. By 1980, Highway85 was renumbered as Highway86, to improve the continuity <b>of</b> <b>provincial</b> route numbers. However, when the majority of Highway86 was decommissioned in 1998, the remaining portion was soon renumbered as Highway85 in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Royal {{officials}} {{were divided into}} three categories; officials attached to the palace, officials of central administration and officials <b>of</b> <b>provincial</b> administration. One {{of the most important}} positions was the purohita, the advisor of the king. The king also had a board of ministers called amati paheja. In central administration, senapati (Commander-in-Chief of the Army) was a position second only to the king, and held by a member of nobility. This position, and also the positions of yuvaraja (sub king), administrative positions in the country's provinces and major ports and provinces, were often held by relatives of the king.|$|E

5|$|The Essex Bypass, {{completed}} {{around the}} village of Essex in 1972, was designed to accommodate future widening to a divided four lane road when traffic volumes warranted. By the mid-1990s, a regular pattern of fatalities were occurring, prompting local politicians and Essex Member <b>of</b> <b>Provincial</b> Parliament (MPP) Bruce Crozier to lobby the MTO widen the route.|$|E
5|$|The late Republic saw an {{increase}} in the centralisation of power into the hands <b>of</b> <b>provincial</b> governors, the use of military power to enforce political changes (e.g. the Sullan dictatorship), and the use of violence, combined with exploitation of the suitably bribed or intimidated 'sovereign' assemblies, to grant supreme authority to victorious commanders. The increasing legitimisation of violence and centralisation of authority into fewer and fewer men would, with the collapse of trust in the Republic's institutions, put it on a path to civil war and its transformation into the autocratic Roman Empire.|$|E

A Subahdar (provincial viceroy or governor), also called a Nizam was in-charge of the Nizamat. There was a chain of subordinate officials under the Nizams on the executive side and under Diwans on the revenue and judicial side.|$|E
