5|$|Oogonia {{development}} in teleosts fish {{varies according to}} the group, and the determination of <b>oogenesis</b> dynamics allows the understanding of maturation and fertilization processes. Changes in the nucleus, ooplasm, and the surrounding layers characterize the oocyte maturation process.|$|E
25|$|Studies have {{demonstrated}} that new gene mutations for achondroplasia are exclusively inherited from the father and occur during spermatogenesis; it is theorized that <b>oogenesis</b> has some regulatory mechanism that prevents the mutation from being passed on in females.|$|E
25|$|Egg {{development}} is mostly {{completed by the}} insectâ€™s adult stage and is controlled by hormones that control {{the initial stages of}} <b>oogenesis</b> and yolk deposition. Most insects are oviparous, where the young hatch after the eggs have been laid.|$|E
25|$|Human primary oocytes {{are present}} at an {{intermediate}} stage of meiosis, termed prophase I (see <b>Oogenesis).</b> Expression of four key DNA repair genes {{that are necessary}} for homologous recombinational repair during meiosis (BRCA1, MRE11, Rad51, and ATM) decline with age in oocytes. This age-related decline in ability to repair DNA double-strand damages can account for the accumulation of these damages, that then likely contributes to the depletion of the ovarian reserve.|$|E
25|$|Along with {{chemical}} pheromones, {{the presence of}} nuptial gifts {{plays an important role}} in the mating and courtship process. During the physical act of copulation, males transfer nutritious materials to the females. These extra nutrients given to the females can be used by a female to her advantage during the process of <b>oogenesis.</b> The use of nuptial gifts in the mating process, especially when females mate with multiple males, relates to the idea of female choice in deciding egg fertilization.|$|E
25|$|While {{recombination}} of chromosomes is {{an essential}} process during meiosis, {{there is a large}} range of frequency of cross overs across organisms and within species. Sexually dimorphic rates of recombination are termed heterochiasmy, and are observed more often than a common rate between male and females. In mammals, females often have a higher rate of recombination compared to males. It is theorised that there are unique selections acting or meiotic drivers which influence the difference in rates. The difference in rates may also reflect the vastly different environments and conditions of meiosis in <b>oogenesis</b> and spermatogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Spermatozoa are {{the mature}} male gametes in many sexually {{reproducing}} organisms. Thus, eggtogenesis is the male version of gametogenesis, {{of which the}} female equivalent is <b>oogenesis.</b> In mammals it occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the male testes in a stepwise fashion. Spermatogenesis is highly dependent upon optimal conditions for the process to occur correctly, and is essential for sexual reproduction. DNA methylation and histone modification have been implicated in the regulation of this process. It starts at puberty and usually continues uninterrupted until death, although a slight decrease can be discerned in the quantity of produced sperm with increase in age (see Male infertility).|$|E
25|$|Imprinting is {{a dynamic}} process. It must be {{possible}} to erase and re-establish imprints through each generation so that genes that are imprinted in an adult may still be expressed in that adult's offspring. (For example, the maternal genes that control insulin production will be imprinted in a male but will be expressed {{in any of the}} male's offspring that inherit these genes.) The nature of imprinting must therefore be epigenetic rather than DNA sequence dependent. In germline cells the imprint is erased and then re-established according to the sex of the individual, i.e. in the developing sperm (during spermatogenesis), a paternal imprint is established, whereas in developing oocytes (<b>oogenesis),</b> a maternal imprint is established. This process of erasure and reprogramming is necessary such that the germ cell imprinting status is relevant to the sex of the individual. In both plants and mammals there are two major mechanisms that are involved in establishing the imprint; these are DNA methylation and histone modifications.|$|E
25|$|A {{polar body}} biospy is the {{sampling}} of a polar body, {{which is a}} small haploid cell that is formed concomitantly as an egg cell during <b>oogenesis,</b> but which generally {{does not have the}} ability to be fertilized. Compared to a blastocyst biopsy, a polar body biopsy can potentially be of lower costs, less harmful side-effects, and more sensitive in detecting abnormalities. The main advantage of the use of polar bodies in PGD is that they are not necessary for successful fertilisation or normal embryonic development, thus ensuring no deleterious effect for the embryo. One of the disadvantages of PB biopsy is that it only provides information about the maternal contribution to the embryo, which is why cases of maternally inherited autosomal dominant and X-linked disorders that are exclusively maternally transmitted can be diagnosed, and autosomal recessive disorders can only partially be diagnosed. Another drawback is the increased risk of diagnostic error, for instance due to the degradation of the genetic material or events of recombination that lead to heterozygous first polar bodies.|$|E
25|$|Triploidy may be {{the result}} of either digyny (the extra haploid set is from the mother) or diandry (the extra haploid set is from the father). Diandry is mostly caused by {{reduplication}} of the paternal haploid set from a single sperm, but may also be the consequence of dispermic (two sperm) fertilization of the egg. Digyny is most commonly caused by either failure of one meiotic division during <b>oogenesis</b> leading to a diploid oocyte or failure to extrude one polar body from the oocyte. Diandry appears to predominate among early miscarriages, while digyny predominates among triploid zygotes that survive into the fetal period. However, among early miscarriages, digyny is also more common in those cases <8.5 weeks gestational age or those in which an embryo is present. There are also two distinct phenotypes in triploid placentas and fetuses that are dependent on the origin of the extra haploid set. In digyny, there is typically an asymmetric poorly grown fetus, with marked adrenal hypoplasia and a very small placenta. In diandry, a partial hydatidiform mole develops. These parent-of-origin effects reflect the effects of genomic imprinting.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes a gene, {{after being}} turned on, transcribes {{a product that}} (directly or indirectly) {{maintains}} the activity of that gene. For example, Hnf4 and MyoD enhance the transcription of many liver- and muscle-specific genes, respectively, including their own, through the transcription factor activity of the proteins they encode. RNA signalling includes differential recruitment of a hierarchy of generic chromatin modifying complexes and DNA methyltransferases to specific loci by RNAs during differentiation and development. Other epigenetic changes are mediated by the production of different splice forms of RNA, or by formation of double-stranded RNA (RNAi). Descendants of the cell in which the gene was turned on will inherit this activity, even if the original stimulus for gene-activation is no longer present. These genes are often turned on or off by signal transduction, although in some systems where syncytia or gap junctions are important, RNA may spread directly to other cells or nuclei by diffusion. A large amount of RNA and protein is contributed to the zygote by the mother during <b>oogenesis</b> or via nurse cells, resulting in maternal effect phenotypes. A smaller quantity of sperm RNA is transmitted from the father, but there is recent evidence that this epigenetic information can lead to visible changes in several generations of offspring.|$|E
2500|$|During <b>oogenesis,</b> cytoplasmic bridges called [...] "ring canals" [...] {{connect the}} forming oocyte to nurse cells. Nutrients and {{developmental}} control molecules {{move from the}} nurse cells into the oocyte. In the figure to the left, the forming oocyte {{can be seen to}} be covered by follicular support cells.|$|E
2500|$|Parthenogenesis {{can occur}} without meiosis through mitotic <b>oogenesis.</b> This is called apomictic parthenogenesis. Mature egg cells are {{produced}} by mitotic divisions, and these cells directly develop into embryos. In flowering plants, cells [...] of the gametophyte can undergo this process. The offspring produced by apomictic parthenogenesis are full clones of their mother. Examples include aphids.|$|E
2500|$|Insect sexual {{reproduction}} starts with sperm entry that stimulates <b>oogenesis,</b> [...] meiosis occurs and the egg {{moves down the}} genital tract. Accessory glands of the female secrete an adhesive substance to attach eggs to an object and they also supply material that provides the eggs with a protective coating. Oviposition takes place via the female ovipositor.|$|E
2500|$|Surveys {{of cases}} of human {{aneuploidy}} syndromes have shown {{that most of them}} are maternally derived. [...] This raises the question: Why is female meiosis more error prone? The most obvious difference between female <b>oogenesis</b> and male spermatogenesis is the prolonged arrest of oocytes in late stages of prophase I for many years up to several decades. Male gametes on the other hand quickly go through all stages of meiosis I and II.|$|E
2500|$|Through an {{interplay of}} hormones that {{includes}} {{follicle stimulating hormone}} that stimulates folliculogenesis and <b>oogenesis</b> creates a mature egg cell, the female gamete. Fertilization is the event where the egg cell fuses with the male gamete, spermatozoon. [...] After the point of fertilization, the fused product of the female and male gamete {{is referred to as}} a zygote or fertilized egg. The fusion of male and female gametes usually occurs following the act of sexual intercourse. Fertilization can also occur by assisted reproductive technology such as artificial insemination and in vitro fertilisation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{excretory}} system {{consists of}} three regions. The basal region has three cells found within the posterior portion of the midgut. The anterior and superior cavities are formed by the bases of four Malpighian tubules. The superior cavity opens into the lumen of the small intestine. The rectum is a large but thin-walled sac that occupies the posterior fifth of the larvae. The release of waste {{is controlled by the}} rectal valves that lead to the anus. Sometimes, the larvae secrete a liquid that consists of uric acid, water and salts. These contents are often carried outside by workers and ejected, but colonies under water stress may consume the contents. In the reproductive system, queens release a pheromone that prevents dealation and <b>oogenesis</b> in virgin females; those tested in colonies without a queen begin oocyte development after dealation and take up the egg-laying role. Flight muscle degeneration is initiated by mating and juvenile hormones, and prevented by [...] Histolysis begins with the dissolution of the myofibril and the slow breakdown of the myofilaments. Such dissolution continues until it reaches the only free Z-line materials, which would also disappear; only the nuclei and lamellar bodies remain. In one study, the amino acids increase in the hemolymph after insemination.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oogenesis</b> {{consists}} of several sub-processes: oocytogenesis, ootidogenesis, and finally maturation {{to form an}} ovum (<b>oogenesis</b> proper). Folliculogenesis is a separate sub-process that accompanies and supports all three oogenetic sub-processes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Oogenesis,</b> ovogenesis, or <b>oÃ¶genesis</b> [...] is the {{differentiation}} of the ovum (egg cell) into a cell competent to further development when fertilized. It is {{developed from the}} primary oocyte by maturation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{formation}} of an oocyte is called oocytogenesis, which {{is a part of}} <b>oogenesis.</b> <b>Oogenesis</b> results in the {{formation of}} both primary oocytes during fetal period, and of secondary oocytes after it as part of ovulation.|$|E
5000|$|Gametogenesis, the {{development}} of diploid germ cells into either haploid eggs or sperm (respectively <b>oogenesis</b> and spermatogenesis) is different for each species but the general stages are similar. <b>Oogenesis</b> and spermatogenesis have many features in common, they both involve: ...|$|E

50|$|In plants, <b>oogenesis</b> occurs {{inside the}} female {{gametophyte}} via mitosis. In many {{plants such as}} bryophytes, ferns, and gymnosperms, egg cells are formed in archegonia. In flowering plants, the female gametophyte {{has been reduced to}} an eight-celled embryo sac within the ovule inside the ovary of the flower. <b>Oogenesis</b> occurs within the embryo sac and leads to the formation of a single egg cell per ovule.|$|E
50|$|In {{a larger}} perspective, the whole folliculogenesis, from {{primordial}} to preovulatory follicle, {{belongs to the}} stage of ootidogenesis of <b>oogenesis.</b>|$|E
