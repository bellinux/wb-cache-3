Two six-story Palestinian blocks (known as the twins or twin towers and described variously as offices or apartments) lay directly behind it. South of the junction, diagonally across from the IDF, there was a Palestinian National Security Forces <b>outpost</b> {{under the command of}} Brigadier-General Osama al-Ali, a member of the Palestine National Council. The concrete wall that Jamal and Muhammad crouched against was in front of this building; the spot was less than 120 metres from the most northerly point of the Israeli <b>outpost.</b>|$|E

During {{a supply}} run to an <b>outpost</b> {{owned by the}} Ararat Corporation, she discovers that all the scientists except one have been killed. The Ararat Corporation is run by an alien colony of miniature spider robots (led by an entity named Bob) that have infiltrated the U.S. government. The Ararat Corporation has cloned Venom to facilitate the extermination of humanity; however, the clone ravages its hosts and kills the <b>outpost</b> crew.|$|E
5000|$|... "Dummy" [...] <b>outposts</b> are {{uninhabited}} <b>outposts.</b> Apparently, some of {{them were}} used to distract the IDF in order to prevent evacuation of occupied <b>outposts.</b> Others are destined to improve negotiation positions by offering extra <b>outposts</b> to remove and show the world that the State is dismantling <b>outposts,</b> The idea of the [...] "dummy" [...] <b>outposts</b> is attributed to Ze'ev Hever, a former leader of the Jewish Underground. The Sasson Report found that most of the evacuated <b>outposts</b> were unpopulated.|$|R
50|$|Currently, some hundred <b>outposts</b> exist. The Sasson Report gave a {{provisional}} figure of 105 unauthorized <b>outposts</b> by March 2005, although Sasson {{did not have}} the disposal of all the necessary information. It found that 26 <b>outposts</b> were on state lands, 15 on private Palestinian lands and 7 on survey lands. The definition of <b>outposts,</b> neighborhoods and authorized settlements may differ between concerned parties. Due to different interpretation, the number of <b>outposts</b> (and of settlements as well) may differ in statistics.|$|R
50|$|United States and United Kingdom troops manned {{a series}} of 16 border <b>outposts.</b> TRUST {{soldiers}} manned <b>Outposts</b> 1 through 6. BETFOR troops manned <b>Outposts</b> 7 through 16. The local police force, Venezia Giulia Police Force (VG police), assisted the British and American troops in manning the <b>outposts.</b> The VG police carried out the routine law enforcement responsibilities in Zone A.|$|R
5|$|By 01:00 on 12 May, U.S. commanders on {{the ground}} in Khâm Đức were {{notified}} of Westmoreland's decision to evacuate all military personnel, both American and Vietnamese, as well as their civilian dependents. However, most army units {{on the ground}} were left uninformed about the decision, and it led to chaos later when evacuation was underway. During the predawn hours of 12 May, elements of the PAVN 2nd Division continued to increase their pressure on the main compound of the Special Forces Camp. The North Vietnamese made final preparations for the main assault by capturing one mountain <b>outpost</b> at a time, which were manned by U.S. soldiers of the Americal Division, who had placed machine-guns around the main camp as advanced defensive positions. At 04:23, U.S. soldiers reported that <b>outpost</b> number 1 had been overrun, and fighter-bombers were scrambled in an attempt to save it. About 30 minutes later, the defenders of <b>outpost</b> number 7 reported that their position had been surrounded. They attempted to hold their position by calling on an AC-47 gunship to fire directly into their position, in order to stop the attack, but soon afterwards <b>outpost</b> 7 succumbed to the North Vietnamese and the defenders retreated back to Khâm Đức.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 23 January, {{one day after the}} fall of Khe Sanh village, the North Vietnamese 304th Division moved against their next target, the small Laotian <b>outpost</b> at Ban Houei Sane. Prior to 1968, Laotian forces at Ban Houei Sane had played an {{important}} role in the war, watching North Vietnamese infiltration into South Vietnam from a section of the Ho Chi Minh Trail running through Laos. The <b>outpost</b> was manned by 700 Laotian soldiers of BV-33 ‘Elephant’ Battalion, Royal Laos Army, led by Lieutenant Colonel Soulang Phetsampou. As night fell, the North Vietnamese 3rd Battalion of the 24th Regiment began attacking the <b>outpost.</b> The 198th Tank Battalion, which was tasked with supporting the 24th Regiment, was delayed as their tank crews tried to navigate their PT-76 amphibious tanks through the rough local terrain. However, confusion quickly descended on the Laotian defenders as North Vietnamese PT-76 tanks turned up outside their <b>outpost.</b> After three hours of fighting, Soulang decided to abandon his <b>outpost,</b> so he radioed the Lang Vei Special Forces Camp and requested helicopters to evacuate his men and their families. However, as helicopters were unavailable, the Laotians decided to move eastward by foot along Highway 9, in an attempt to reach Lang Vei just across the border in South Vietnam.|$|E

5000|$|In the [...] "Blue Line"-plan, {{written in}} January 2011, at least 26 <b>outposts</b> were {{included}} in areas defined as [...] "state lands". Left-wing activist Dror Etkes said, this means the state has started a process to legitimize these <b>outposts.</b> In March 2011, the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu declared that it intended to legalise <b>outposts</b> that were built on state land, and to evict the <b>outposts</b> that are on private Palestinian lands.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{framework}} of the 2003 Roadmap for Peace, Israel committed itself under Prime Minister Sharon to evacuate <b>outposts,</b> erected from March 2001, the start of the Sharon government. The Israeli government gave the U.S. a list of 28 unauthorized <b>outposts</b> erected in the West Bank since that date, of which 12 were ordered to be removed, [...] "while some of the remaining 16 <b>outposts</b> {{were in the process of}} being approved and planned," [...] according to the Israeli daily Haaretz. However, the Israeli NGO Peace Now claimed that there are 45 unauthorized <b>outposts</b> erected in the West Bank after March 2001. Israel did not meet the commitment under the Roadmap. It dismantled few manned <b>outposts</b> and none of the larger ones.|$|R
5|$|A mass murder–suicide occurs among {{a team of}} geophysicists at an <b>outpost</b> in Icy Cape, Alaska.

With the scientists' bodies the group finds a dog, who attacks Mulder and Bear. Scully notices black nodules on its skin, and suspects {{that it may be}} infected with bubonic plague; she also notices movement beneath its skin. Although Bear (who was bitten by the dog) becomes ill and develops similar nodules on his body, autopsies reveal no such nodules on the bodies of the scientists.|$|E

5|$|As the 1st and 3rd Light Horse Brigades {{continued}} their dismounted attacks, they were shelled by Ottoman artillery. By 17:30 the 1st Light Horse Brigade had blocked all exits from Beersheba in the mosque area, including {{the hospital and}} barracks, capturing 96 prisoners, hospital staff, a priest, medical-corps details and 89 patients. The brigade established an <b>outpost</b> line in this sector, having suffered seven men killed and 83 wounded, 68 horses killed and 23 wounded. The 10th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) held an <b>outpost</b> line north of Beersheba during the night, {{when a group of}} Ottoman soldiers approached the line at about 21:00. They were surrounded on three sides before the regiment fired on them with machine-guns, killing 50.|$|E
5|$|At another crop <b>outpost</b> in Tunisia, the Cigarette Smoking Man warns Strughold that Mulder {{remains a}} threat, as he {{explains}} what Mulder has {{found out about the}} virus. He then hands him a telegram revealing that the X-files unit has been re-opened.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} end of the camp, three North Vietnamese PT-76 tanks rolled through the barbed-wire barrier in front of Company 102 and 103. From point blank, North Vietnamese tank crews destroyed several bunkers with their guns, forcing the soldiers of Company 102 and 103 to abandon their positions. Those who survived the onslaught either retreated to the reconnaissance positions, or along Highway 9, toward Khe Sanh in the east. About 800 meters to the west, Sergeant First Class Charles W. Lindewald, an adviser to the Mobile Strike Force, also reported back to Willoughby that the early warning <b>outpost</b> was in danger of being overrun. To save it, Lindewald directed artillery strikes on the North Vietnamese troops moving up towards his <b>outpost,</b> but he later died from a gunshot wound to the stomach as the North Vietnamese overran the <b>outpost.</b> At about 01:30, Shungel and his hastily organized tank-killer teams were busy engaging the North Vietnamese tanks that were roaming the Company 104 area; on many occasions the M-72 rockets fired by the Americans either missed completely, jammed, misfired, or simply failed to knock out the enemy tanks. By 02:30, the North Vietnamese had broken through the inner perimeter of the camp, and began harassing the soldiers trapped inside the tactical operations center, which included Willoughby along with seven other Americans, three South Vietnamese special forces, and 26 CIDG soldiers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Outposts,</b> small settlements, some {{authorized}} {{and some}} unauthorized, often on hilltops.

5|$|By May, the Rangers were emplaced at Hill 258, on {{the front}} lines between the 31st RCT and the 7th Marine Regiment of the U.S. 1st Marine Division. They {{conducted}} frequent patrols along an <b>outpost</b> network, often encountering and engaging Chinese troops. They fortified the hill and surrounding areas, which served as an advance <b>outpost</b> to warn the 7th Infantry Division if the Chinese attacked. During this period, the fighting entered a lull, and troops resumed their rest and recuperation rotations. Allen, Pryor, and Freeman left on one such rotation with a number of men, leaving Queen and only 80 enlisted men on the hill.|$|E
5|$|During {{the days}} after the landing, the ground forces secured the Jacquinot Bay area. AIB {{personnel}} manned an <b>outpost</b> to warn of the approach of Japanese forces, while the combat troops patrolled and established positions near the main landing area. On 6 November the company from the 1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion was moved by landing craft to the northern shore of Jacquinot Bay, and subsequently guarded the tracks leading to this area. This unit later relieved the AIB of responsibility for maintaining some of its positions to the east of Jacquinot Bay. During this period the 14th/32nd Battalion remained near the landing area, though one of its companies gradually established an <b>outpost</b> between 8 and 12 November.|$|E

5|$|Integritys first voyage was in February 1804, {{heading south}} along the eastern {{coastline}} of Australia to transport settlers and supplies across Bass Strait to the colonial <b>outpost</b> in Van Diemen's Land. The administrator of that <b>outpost,</b> Lieutenant John Bowen, had recently resigned his position and returned to Port Jackson. Governor King now directed that Bowen travel back to Van Diemen's Land aboard Integrity in order to formalise the transfer of colonial authority to his successor. However Bowen refused to go aboard, and the cutter ultimately sailed without him in order to deliver its supplies. The voyage was a success other than a broken rudder fastener which was repaired when Integrity reached Van Diemen's Land in early March. The cutter then completed the round trip back to Port Jackson, arriving safely at her home port on 24 April.|$|E

50|$|<b>Outposts</b> {{appeared}} {{after the}} 1993 Oslo I Accord, when the Israeli government made commitments {{to freeze the}} building of new settlements. Although <b>outposts</b> were not officially supported by the government, Israeli public authorities and other government bodies {{played a major role}} in establishing and developing them, according to the 2005 Sasson Report, commissioned by then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. <b>Outposts</b> differ from neighborhoods in that they are built at a substantial distance from authorized settlements, while neighborhoods are attached to an existing settlement.|$|R
