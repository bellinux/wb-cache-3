In the present work, variation of sensitivity and nonlinearity of a micro electro mechanical system low pressure sensor is investigated. The sensor is modeled using finite element method to analyze the variation of sensitivity and nonlinearity with diaphragm thickness. To verify the simulated results, the sensors with different diaphragm thicknesses are fabricated. The models are verified by comparing the calculated results with experimental data.

30|$|During {{the gold}} wet etching with the {{potassium}} iodide (KI) solution, glass {{will not be}} etched and keep intact, this is another advantage over dry etching, because dry etching tends to leave some <b>over-etched</b> trenches on the glass substrate [8] which will introduce some scattering loss. We consider two kinds of nanospheres: wet etching endurable and unendurable nanospheres. For example, polystyrene nanospheres will become waxy in the gold etchant, cover the gold and stop its etching, thus {{they have to be}} removed prior to wet etching. On the other hand, silica nanospheres keep intact during the wet etching, {{but it is difficult to}} be removed after etching. This paper simulated the obtainable gold nanostructure profiles after wet etching for both kinds of nanosphere masks, thus the fabrication process is designable and controllable by simulations.|$|E

Moreover, it has been examined if <b>over-etching</b> (application time of the acid: 2 minutes) was an effective technique to improve the adhesion to the endodontic substrate, after highlighting the problems of adhesion concerning its anatomical characteristics and the changes after the endodontic treatment.

40|$|Anomalous group {{velocity}} dispersion {{is a key}} parameter for generating bright solitons, and thus wideband Kerr frequency combs. Extension of frequency combs to visible wavelength in conventional photonic materials and structures {{has been a major}} challenge due to strong normal material dispersion at the relevant frequencies. Extension of frequency combs toward the normal dispersion region is possible via dispersive waves through soliton-induced Cherenkov radiation. However, this potentially powerful technique has not been used for extending frequency combs to the visible spectrum. In this paper, we demonstrate a new microresonator structure formed by an <b>over-etched</b> silicon nitride waveguide that enables the use of soliton-induced Cherenkov radiation to extend the bandwidth of the Kerr-combs. Furthermore, we show that by careful dispersion engineering in a coupled microring resonator structure we can optimize the properties (e. g., wavelength, and amplitude) of the generated dispersive wave to further extend the Kerr frequency combs to the visible spectrum while increasing the total Kerr-comb bandwidth as well...|$|E
40|$|Anisotropic etching {{of silicon}} in {{potassium}} hydroxide (KOH) {{is an important}} technology in micromachining. The residue deposition from KOH etching of Si is typically regarded as a disadvantage of this technology. In this report, we make use of this residue as a second masking layer to fabricate two-layer complex structures. Square patterns with size {{in the range of}} 15 – 150 μm and gap distance of 5 μm have been designed and tested. The residue masking layer appears when the substrate is <b>over-etched</b> in hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution over a threshold. The two-layer structures of micropyramids surrounded by wall-like structures are obtained according to the two different masking layers of SiO 2 and residue. The residue masking layer is stable and can survive over KOH etching for long time to achieve deep Si etching. The process parameters of etchant concentration, temperature, etching time and pattern size have been investigated. With well-controlled two-layer structures, useful structures could be designed for applications in plasmonic and microfluidic devices in the future...|$|E
40|$|A {{good deal}} of effort has gone into {{defining}} {{the conditions under which}} single molecule spectroscopy can be used to study complex biochemical phenomena, such as enzyme dynamics. Furthermore, there is significant interest in understanding how biomolecules behave under conditions of crowding and confinement in the ultrasmall volumes relevant to nanomanufacturing. We have developed a new modality for zero-mode waveguide (ZMW) studies employing <b>over-etched</b> Au-based ZMWs, which have significant advantages relative to the more commonly encountered Al ZMWs. Furthermore, these platforms are applied to an intrinsically interesting system—the single enzyme dynamics of sarcosine oxidase—an enzyme important for bacterial energy management. Because we identify just those ZMWs that contain exactly one enzyme and because this enzyme is covalently attached to the SiO 2 floor of the ZMW, one can readily imagine carrying out experiments where the interior structure of the pore can be modified to change the immediate environment of the enzyme molecule in a well-controlled manner. The spectroscopic results themselves speak to enzyme turnover rate distributions, static and dynamic heterogeneity and even allow measurement of off-time distributions for mismatched substrates, i. e. L-proline. Taken together these results point the way to realize a powerful new platform for spectroscopic studies of single enzyme dynamics...|$|E

30|$|Increasing the pore {{diameter}} by chemical <b>over-etching</b> {{has been}} performed {{by using an}} acidic etchant consisting of a mixture of HF/HNO 3 /HAc. Even though this generally isotropic etchant is well studied for “flat” structures, cf. e.g. [7], {{it is difficult to}} <b>over-etch</b> deep macropores homogeneously, since the concentration of the necessary species at the pore tips will always be different from the one at the top. It is only possible to etch the pores homogeneously, if the reactions are not diffusion controlled, necessitating very dilute acids. The drawback then is long etching times, which may take up to 12 h in our case. This might look like a severe obstacle for mass production on a first view, but the problem might easily be overcome by a batch process, i.e. many wafers are etched simultaneously in one (cheap) etching station, cutting down the effective production time.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{chemical}} etching technique using etchants composed of hydrazine hydrate and ethylene diamine to generate V-shape grooves in thick polyimide films through photoresist masks has been developed. The etching characteristics, {{in terms of}} etch rate, side etched width and taper angle, {{have been found to}} depend strongly on (i) preparation condition of the films, especially baking temperature, and (ii) the composition and temperature of the etchants. In order to achieve prefer-ential etching behavior, the polyimide films have been fabricated by repeating 3 times a coating process, which consists of a spin coating followed by two sequential bakings. An optimizedbaking condition {{has been found to be}} 15 min at 150 ~ in air for each prebaking and 2 min and. 30 min at 185 ~ in N 2 for the first two and the last postbaking, respectively. An optimized condition of the etchants has also developed. Under the optimized condition, a side etched width less than 20 % of the film thickness and a constant taper angle of about 35 ~ has been achieved. The size of the V-shape grooves has been controlled by both the opening width in the photoresist masks and the side etch rate. The taper angle ofthe grooves has been determined by the film preparation condition itself, and is independent of the etching time even when the films are <b>over-etched.</b> Significant progress in GaAs device technologies such as ion implantation and epitaxial growth by mo-lecular beam epitaxy or metalorganic chemical vapo...|$|E
40|$|A Space Shuttle Reaction Control System (RCS) {{thruster}} failed {{during a}} firing test at the NASA White Sands Test Facility (WSTF), Las Cruces, New Mexico. The firing test was being conducted {{to investigate a}} previous electrical malfunction. A number of cracks were found associated with the fuel closure plate/injector assembly (Fig 1). The firing test failure generated a flight constraint to the launch of STS- 133. A team comprised of several NASA centers and other research institutes was assembled to investigate and determine {{the root cause of}} the failure. The JSC Materials Evaluation Laboratory was asked to compare and characterize the outboard circumferential electron beam (EB) weld between the fuel closure plate (Titanium 6 Al- 4 V) and the injector (Niobium C- 103 alloy) of four different RCS thrusters, including the failed RCS thruster. Several metallographic challenges in grinding/polishing, and particularly in etching were encountered because of the differences in hardness, ductility, and chemical resistance between the two alloys and the bimetallic weld. Segments from each thruster were sectioned from the outboard weld. The segments were hot-compression mounted using a conductive, carbon-filled epoxy. A grinding/polishing procedure for titanium alloys was used [1]. This procedure worked well on the titanium; but a thin, disturbed layer was visible on the niobium surface by means of polarized light. Once polished, each sample was micrographed using bright field, differential interference contrast optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a backscatter electron (BSE) detector. No typical weld anomalies were observed in any of the cross sections. However, areas of large atomic contrast were clearly visible in the weld nugget, particularly along fusion line interfaces between the titanium and the niobium. This prompted the need to better understand the chemistry and microstructure of the weld (Fig 2). Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) was used to confirm the chemical composition of the variations in contrast in these areas. Niobium alloys generally require exposure to more aggressive chemical reagents than titanium alloys for etching because of niobium s chemical resistance; therefore, the titanium portion of the sample was etched first. A five second immersion in Kroll s reagent revealed a general microstructure on the titanium portion of the sample; however, the titanium heat affected zone closest to the weld, was <b>over-etched</b> due to higher concentrations of refined grains and an increase in eta-phase. The Kroll s etchant also revealed some microstructure in the weld nugget itself; the niobium portion of the sample remained unetched...|$|E

30|$|In summary, {{the effect}} of H 2 {{percentage}} during the barriers growth on InGaN/GaN MQWs properties has been systematically studied. As {{a small percentage of}} H 2 (≤ 6.25 %) is introduced, the combined effect of enhanced H 2 etch effect and surface diffusion contribute to the improvement of surface, interface and optical properties. In spite of the strongest PL intensity achieved by introducing large percentage H 2 (50 %), the integrated effect of H 2 <b>over-etching</b> and stress relaxation degrades surface and interface quality of the InGaN/GaN MQWs. Hence, the use of H 2 with appropriate proportion during the barriers growth can achieve smooth surface with low pits density and enhanced optical performance.
