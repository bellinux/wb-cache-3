5|$|Although {{freshwater}} invertebrates inhabiting and comprising {{algae and}} periphyton make {{the foundation of}} food webs {{in the middle and}} lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding {{on the bottom of the}} river and ocean floors. The abundance and importance <b>of</b> <b>oysters</b> (Crassostrea virginica) is apparent in the many middens left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high. Oysters and other mollusks serve as the primary food source of shorebirds. The large trees that line the river from its source to south of Jacksonville begin to transition into salt marshes east of the city. Mayport is home to approximately 20 shrimping vessels that use the mouth of the St. Johns to access the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have been}} an {{important}} source of food for humans at least since Roman times and empty shells found in middens at archaeological sites are evidence of earlier consumption. Oysters, scallops, clams, ark clams, mussels and cockles are the most commonly consumed kinds of bivalve, and are eaten cooked or raw. In 1950, the year in which the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) started making such information available, world trade in bivalve molluscs was 1,007,419 tons. By 2010, world trade in bivalves had risen to 14,616,172 tons, up from 10,293,607 tons a decade earlier. The figures included 5,554,348 (3,152,826) tons of clams, cockles and ark shells, 1,901,314 (1,568,417) tons of mussels, 4,592,529 (3,858,911) tons <b>of</b> <b>oysters</b> and 2,567,981 (1,713,453) tons of scallops.

5|$|The smooth toadfish {{has strong}} jaws that readily crush {{shellfish}} and crustaceans.

Its diet includes molluscs such as black mussels, pipis, white sunset shells (Soletellina alba) and oysters (Crassostrea), crustaceans such as semaphore crabs and shrimp, and brown algae. The proportions of crustaceans to molluscs can vary widely depending on the abundance of food items; hence in a 1999 field study, the soldier crab (Mictyris longicarpus) predominated in Cowan Creek while the black mussel did so in nearby Berowra Creek.

40|$|It is {{said that}} the {{application}} of alkaline material is an effective method of suppressing Cd absorption by plants in Cd contaminated soil. Since the main ingredient <b>of</b> <b>oyster</b> shells is calcium carbonate, it may be thought that the application <b>of</b> <b>oyster</b> shells is effective in suppressing Cd absorption by plants in soil contaminated by Cd, {{but there are many}} points which are not understood about this effect. In this study, combinations of {{the presence or absence of}} added Cd (1 μgg- 1) in commercial loamy soil (total Cd; 0. 38 μgg- 1) and application of calcium carbonate or <b>of</b> <b>oyster</b> shells were made, and the effects <b>of</b> applications <b>of</b> <b>oyster</b> shells on the growth of pak choi (qinggengcai), Chinese cabbage and cabbage, and on their absorption of Cd, Cu, Mn, Fe and Zn were investigated. With the soil without added Cd, the growth of 3 species of plants was less with application <b>of</b> <b>oyster</b> shells compared to application of CaCO 3. The Cd concentrations in the leaf were 0. 01 ～ 0. 04 μg DW g- 1, and there was no significant difference between applications <b>of</b> <b>oyster</b> shells and CaCO 3. With the soil with added Cd, the dry weight of the leaves of the 3 species was about the same with application <b>of</b> <b>oyster</b> shells as with application of calcium carbonate. The Cd concentration in the leaf of cabbage with application <b>of</b> <b>oyster</b> shells was 1. 9 μg DW g- 1, and the Cd content was 2. 5 μg plant- 1, indicating that it is significantly lower than with application of CaCO 3. Significant differences in Cu, Zn and Mn concentrations were not seen in the leaf of the cabbage between application <b>of</b> <b>oyster</b> shells and CaCO 3, but the Fe concentration was significantly lower with application <b>of</b> <b>oyster</b> shells compared to CaCO 3.

40|$|From 2000 onwards, the United States saw an {{increasing}} trend for the shellfish aquaculture practices especially along the Northeast coast. Despite the supporting majority of public regarding the shellfish aquaculture operations, these operations are sometimes opposed by local communities claiming the devaluation of housing property {{due to the}} construction <b>of</b> <b>oyster</b> farm. Since the uproars against the devaluing of housing property is directly affecting the lives of public, it is critically important to study the effect <b>of</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>oyster</b> farm on its value. A difference-in-difference (DoD) model within hedonic price model (HPM) {{was used to evaluate}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>oyster</b> farm on property value.

The statistical insignificance of the coefficients suggests that there is not much change in housing value due to the construction <b>of</b> <b>oyster</b> farm.

25|$|Oyster {{depuration}} begins {{after the}} harvest <b>of</b> <b>oysters</b> from farmed locations. The oysters are transported and placed into tanks pumped with clean water for periods of 48 to 72 hours. The holding temperatures and salinity {{vary according to}} species. The seawater that the oysters were originally farmed in does not remain in the oyster, since the water used for depuration must be fully sterilized, plus the depuration facility would not necessarily be located near the farming location. Depuration <b>of</b> <b>oysters</b> can remove moderate levels of contamination of most bacterial indicators and pathogens. Well-known contaminants include Vibrio parahaemolyticus which is a bacterium found in seawater animals that is temperature sensitive, and Escherichia coli which is a bacterium found in coastal waters near highly populated cities having sewage systems discharging waste nearby, or from agricultural discharges. Depuration expands beyond oysters into many shellfish and other related products, especially in seafood that is known to come from potentially polluted areas; depurated seafood is effectively a product cleansed from inside-out to make it safe for human consumption.|$|E
