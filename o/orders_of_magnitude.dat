5000|$|The <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> {{a number}} is, {{intuitively}} speaking, {{the number of}} powers of 10 contained in the number. More precisely, the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> a number can be {{defined in terms of}} the common logarithm, usually as the integer part of the logarithm, obtained by truncation. For example, the number [...] has a logarithm (in base 10) <b>of</b> 6.602; its <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> is 6. When truncating, a number <b>of</b> this <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> is between 106 and 107. In a similar example, with the phrase [...] "He had a seven-figure income", the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> is the number of figures minus one, so it is very easily determined without a calculator to 6. An <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> is an approximate position on a logarithmic scale.|$|R

5|$|The chief {{questions}} raised by Kulakov were that the claimed alpha decay energy of sergenium was many <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> lower than expected and the half-life given was eight <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> shorter than what would be predicted for a nuclide alpha decaying with the claimed decay energy, {{but at the same}} time a corrected half-life in the region of 1016years would be impossible as it would imply that the samples contained about 100milligrams of sergenium. In 2003 it was suggested that the observed alpha decay with energy 4.5MeV could be due to a low-energy and strongly enhanced transition between different hyperdeformed states of a hassium isotope around 271Hs, thus suggesting that the existence of superheavy elements in nature was at least possible, although unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Like in {{most other}} d-block groups, the {{abundance}} in Earth's crust of group 12 elements decreases with higher atomic number. Zinc is with 65 parts per million (ppm) the most abundant in the group while cadmium with 0.1 ppm and mercury with 0.08 ppm are <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> less abundant. Copernicium, as a synthetic element with a half-life of a few minutes, may only {{be present in the}} laboratories where it was produced.|$|E
50|$|An <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> is an {{approximate}} {{measure of the}} size of a number, equal to the logarithm (base 10) rounded to a whole number. For example, the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> 1500 is 3, because 1500 = 1.5 × 103.|$|R
40|$|Converting complex {{equations}} into simpler, more tractable equations {{usually involves}} approximation. Approximation is usually done by identifying and removing insignificant terms, while retaining significant ones. The {{significance of a}} term can be determined by <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> reasoning. In this paper we describe NAPIER, an implemented <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> reasoning system. NAPIER defines the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> a quantity on a logarithmic scale, and uses {{a set of rules}} to propagate <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitudes</b> through equations. A novel feature of NAPIER is the way it handles non-linear simultaneous equations, using linear programming in conjunction with backtracking. We show that <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> reasoning in NAPIER is, in general, intractable and then discuss an approximate reasoning technique that allow it to run fast in practice. Some of NAPIER's inference rules are heuristic, and we estimate the error introduced by their use. 1 INTRODUCTION Mathematical models [...] ...|$|R

5|$|The {{function}} of the toxins to the hooded pitohui has {{been the source of}} debate and research since its discovery. The initial suggestion was that the toxins acted as a chemical deterrent to predators.

5|$|Alan Stern and Harold F. Levison {{introduced}} a parameter Λ (lambda), expressing {{the likelihood of}} an encounter resulting in a given deflection of orbit. The value of this parameter in Stern's model {{is proportional to the}} square of the mass and inversely proportional to the period. This value can be used to estimate the capacity of a body to clear the neighbourhood of its orbit, where Λ > 1 will eventually clear it. A gap of five <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> in Λ was found between the smallest terrestrial planets and the largest asteroids and Kuiper belt objects.|$|E
5|$|Early {{observations}} {{have revealed}} a few genuinely hyperbolic (i.e. non-periodic) trajectories, {{but no more}} than could be accounted for by perturbations from Jupiter. If comets pervaded interstellar space, they would be moving with velocities of the same order as the relative velocities of stars near the Sun (a few tens of km per second). If such objects entered the Solar System, they would have positive specific orbital energy and would be observed to have genuinely hyperbolic trajectories. A rough calculation shows that there might be four hyperbolic comets per century within Jupiter's orbit, give or take one and perhaps two <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of the weak interaction, fermions can {{exchange}} three distinct types of force carriers known as the W+, W−, and Z bosons. The mass of each of these bosons is far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, which is consistent with the short range of the weak force. The force is in fact termed weak because its field strength over a given distance is typically several <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> less than that of the strong nuclear force or electromagnetic force.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are able}} to recognize or distort the Holliday junction structure. One such class contains junction-resolving enzymes that cleave the junctions, sometimes in a sequence-specific fashion. Such proteins distort {{the structure of the}} junction in various ways, often pulling the junction into an unstacked conformation, breaking the central base pairs, and/or changing the angles between the four arms. Other classes are branch migration proteins that increase the exchange rate by <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude,</b> and site-specific recombinases. In prokaryotes, Holliday junction resolvases fall into two families, integrases and nucleases, that are each structurally similar although their sequences are not conserved.|$|E

Soluble inorganic forms of germanium used at first, notably the citrate-lactate salt, resulted {{in some cases}} of renal dysfunction, hepatic steatosis, and peripheral neuropathy in individuals using them over a long term. Plasma and urine germanium concentrations in these individuals, several of whom died, were several <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> greater than endogenous levels. A more recent organic form, beta-carboxyethylgermanium sesquioxide (propagermanium), has not exhibited the same spectrum of toxic effects.|$|E
5|$|The black morph is {{less common}} than the spotted form but, at about {{six percent of}} the population, it is several <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> above the {{mutation}} rate.

The black form may {{be an example of}} heterozygote advantage; breeding in captivity is not yet conclusive on this. Melanistic jaguars (or “black” jaguars) occur primarily in parts of South America, and are virtually unknown in wild populations residing in the subtropical and temperate regions of North America; they have never been documented north of Mexico’s Isthmus of Tehuantepec.|$|E

These are expected to also be nymphal food plants. The species was associated with white feather honeymyrtle (Melaleuca decora) in a study at three sites in western Sydney. The broad-leaved paperbark has been confirmed as a nymphal food plant.|$|E
