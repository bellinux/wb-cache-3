5|$|The {{appearances}} of the Turk were profitable for Mälzel, {{and he continued}} by taking it and his <b>other</b> <b>machines</b> to the United States. In 1826, he opened an exhibition in New York City that slowly grew in popularity, giving rise to many newspaper stories and anonymous threats of exposure of the secret. Mälzel's problem was finding a proper director for the machine, having trained an unknown woman in France {{before coming to the}} United States. He ended up recalling a former director, William Schlumberger, from Alsace in Europe to come to America and work for him again once Mälzel was able to provide the money for Schlumberger's transport.|$|E
5|$|On 11 April, 4th Regiment Hurricanes {{successfully}} {{shot down}} a Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter over Nova Gradiška. The following day, {{two or three}} of the remaining 105th Squadron Hurricanes were burned by ground crews at Veliki Radinci, while <b>other</b> <b>machines</b> from the same squadron flew to Bijeljina, where other aircraft had concentrated. This move had only just been completed when a large formation of German Bf 110s swept over the airfield and destroyed over two dozen aircraft, including {{all but one of the}} 105th Squadron Hurricanes. At Knić, approaching German vehicles caused the last two 163rd Squadron Hurricanes to scramble, flying to Zemun. The first pilot landed safely, but was immediately captured by armed Volksdeutsche. The other pilot, seeing that Zemun was not safe, broke off and tried to fly to Bjeljina, but ran out of fuel and was killed when he tried to crash-land near Valjevo. Even at this late stage, the 4th Regiment still had five or six airworthy Hurricanes. They continued to chase reconnaissance aircraft throughout the day, shooting down one Ju 88 near Banja Luka. When German bombers again attacked the airfields around Mostar, the one remaining Hurricane of the Air Training School attacked a Ju 88 but was hit by return fire, forcing the pilot to bail out.|$|E

5|$|Park's plan paid dividends. Bf 110s from ZG 26 {{were soon}} {{discovered}} by No. 56 Squadron and quickly found themselves under attack. In {{the short and}} sharp engagement, ZG 26 lost five Bf 110s and another damaged to No. 56 Squadron. Worse was to follow when No. 54 and 501 engaged the Messerschmitts. ZG 26 lost a further two shot down and two damaged to No. 54 Squadron. None of the RAF Squadrons reported any losses in these engagements. The Geschwader lost <b>other</b> <b>machines</b> to No. 151 and No. 46 Squadrons who arrived to join the battle. According to one source, the total losses of ZG 26 amounted to 12 destroyed and seven damaged throughout the entire day. Another source gives a list of 15 Bf 110s written off; 13 destroyed, two written off and six damaged on 18 August 1940. Whatever the actual losses, The Hardest Day marked {{the start of a}} decline in Bf 110 operations. Production was not keeping pace with losses, and there simply were not enough aircraft to go around.|$|E

25|$|The {{application}} features {{distributed processing}} abilities, which can function across an Ethernet LAN. One machine runs the Logic Pro app, while the <b>other</b> <b>machines</b> {{on the network}} run the Logic node app. Logic will then offload the effects and synth processing to the <b>other</b> <b>machines</b> on the network. If the network is fast enough (i.e. gigabit Ethernet) this can work in near-real time, depending on buffer settings and CPU loads. This allows users to combine the power of several Mac computers to process Logic Pro’s built-in software instruments and plug-ins, and 3rd party processing plug-ins.|$|E

25|$|The {{competitive}} edge for Dorsey's Micom 2000 was that, unlike many <b>other</b> <b>machines,</b> {{it was truly}} programmable. The Micom machine countered the problem of obsolescence by avoiding the limitations of a hard-wired system of program storage. The Micom 2000 utilized RAM, which was mass-produced and totally programmable. The Micom 2000 {{was said to be}} a year ahead of its time when it was introduced into a marketplace that represented some pretty serious competition such as IBM, Xerox and Wang Laboratories.|$|E

25|$|In 1730, the French Academy of Sciences {{certified}} three machines {{designed by}} Hillerin de Boistissandeau. The first one used a single tooth carry mechanism which, according to Boistissandeau, wouldn't work properly if a carry {{had to be}} moved more than two places; the two <b>other</b> <b>machines</b> used springs that were gradually armed until they released their energy when a carry had to be moved forward. It was similar to Pascal's calculator but instead of using the energy of gravity Boistissandeau used the energy stored into the springs.|$|E

25|$|In 1802 William Paley {{formulated}} {{the first}} known teleological argument depicting machines producing <b>other</b> <b>machines,</b> suggesting {{that the question of}} who originally made a watch was rendered moot if it were demonstrated that the watch was able to manufacture a copy of itself. Scientific study of self-reproducing machines was anticipated by John Bernal as early as 1929 and by mathematicians such as Stephen Kleene who began developing recursion theory in the 1930s. Much of this latter work was motivated by interest in information processing and algorithms rather than physical implementation of such a system, however.|$|E

40|$|Special purpose {{machine tools}} (SPMs) {{have been widely}} used to perform drilling-related {{operations}} in high volume production including within automotive component industries. The first step in designing and manufacturing a SPM is a feasibility analysis. Since SPMs have relatively higher investment cost than <b>other</b> <b>machine</b> tools, this task must be performed before any investment on the preparation of detailed design. The present paper explores an economic feasibility analysis strategy which aims to make logical decision by assessing the strengths and limitations of an SPM in comparison with <b>other</b> <b>machine</b> tools. The mathematical product cost model for SPMs is proposed for estimating important economic factors and then financial indicators are calculated to evaluate the SPM’s economic performance. A case study is used to examine the proposed model and results are compared with <b>other</b> <b>machine</b> tools. The proposed model provides a decision support approach for selecting an SPM for manufacturing a given part from an economic perspective...|$|R
