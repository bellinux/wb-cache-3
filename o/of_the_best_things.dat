500|$|Youth {{development}} and scouring for talent abroad {{is central to}} Wenger's recruitment policy. He relies on a network of scouts and personal contacts to find and attract talented footballers to play under him. Wenger's strategy is aided by data; for instance, the decision to sign Flamini in 2004 came about as {{he was looking at}} statistics to find an understudy to Vieira. To examine the mental state of a young footballer, he uses psychometric tests conducted by psychologist Jacques Crevoisier once every two years. Wenger prides himself on nurturing talent, saying in an interview: [...] "I believe one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> about managing people is that we can influence lives in a positive way.

500|$|The plot of Rob-B-Hood {{received}} mixed reviews: The Chinese newspaper Xiao Xiang Chen Bao {{found it}} concise, hilarious and touching, whereas Jay Weissberg criticised it for being unoriginal. In addition, Felix Cheong of Channel NewsAsia found the subplots involving the antagonists' families redundant, detracting {{from the main}} story and making the film [...] "tediously long". However, Chan was praised for his decision to play a darker character in Rob-B-Hood. Andrew Sun of South China Morning Post stated that [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> Chan can do for his flagging movie career is to play a heavy—a nasty, scum-of-the-earth antagonist, since you do not always have to play a hero to be a hero."

A photo gallery was also included as well as backstage footage showing Gaga meeting with actress Liza Minnelli. According to Jeffrey Kauffman of Blu-ray.com, the audio tracks were commendable for their crisp sound. He stated that [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> about this concert is despite its artifice, even its artificiality, there's absolutely no question that Lady Gaga is actually singing. What a novel idea for a live concert, and one that seemed especially refreshing after having just sat through the [...] concert Blu-ray, where Brit's live voice was all but buried in the pre-records." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Imprisoned {{with the}} Pharaohs" [...] became a popular story and was {{received}} favorably by Houdini. The escape artist {{was so impressed}} that, until his death, he continued offering the writer jobs and ghostwriting opportunities. Among them was an article criticizing astrology (for which he was paid $75 [...] approximately $ in present-day terms) and a book entitled The Cancer of Superstition, of which Lovecraft had completed an outline and some introductory pages prior to Houdini's 1926 death.

[...] Busis praised the final fairytale scenes as [...] "intense, effective..... awesome." [...] IGN writer Amy Ratcliffe rated the episode 7/10, giving praise to Robert Carlyle and guest actor Brad Dourif, but criticizing Lana Parrilla's constant [...] "dagger stares and pursed lips" [...] to Emma. Ratcliffe did however believe Ginnifer Goodwin and Joshua Dallas had [...] "electric chemistry," [...] and wished viewers could see more scenes between the two. Like Ratcliffe, Digital Spy columnist Catriona Wightman lauded Parrilla and Carlyle's performances, believing the latter [...] "continues to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> about Once Upon A Time - this completely new version of Rumpelstiltskin we saw was illuminating.

The two felt that the idea that Mulder and Scully were friends throughout their various lives was [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> about the story". They also wrote {{that the fact that}} Melissa and Mulder were somehow soul mates also prevented the story from being [...] "obvious and pat". However, Shearman and Pearson felt that Morgan and Wong added [...] "a few too many ingredients" [...] which yielded an uneven episode. Entertainment Weekly, on the other hand, was negative, giving the episode an [...] "F" [...] and describing it as [...] "stultifyingly awful".|$|E
500|$|The Mana {{series has}} been mostly well received, though each title has seen varied levels of success.
