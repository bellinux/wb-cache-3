40|$|In view of {{a rapidly}} {{increasing}} importance in applications, as well as significant fundamental observations, the temperature anomalies displayed by several <b>oxyethylene</b> compounds, including poly(ethylene glycol), and <b>oxyethylene</b> surfactants and copolymers continue to create interest but also controversies. Here we review {{a wide range of}} experimental observations and present the different theoretical approaches that have been suggested. We find that a model that attributes the temperature effects to conformational changes that make the <b>oxyethylene</b> groups less polar at higher temperature has a strong predictive power and gives a quantitative rationalization of phase diagrams and other observations. In line with observations, it also predicts that the behaviour is not restricted to aqueous solutions but also occurs in other solvents. Different NMR approaches as well as Raman spectroscopy directly demonstrate the conformational behaviour predicted. We also note that the relevant molecular segment also occurs in other compounds, like cellulose derivatives such as methylcellulose. In line with this, qualitatively the same type of temperature anomalies is found for these compounds as with oxyethylene-containing substances. To cite this article: Bjo: Lindman, G. Karlstrom, C R.

The membrane characteristics of these lipids were compared with a control lipid, 5, bearing just an ether functionality at both the C-I and C- 2 positions. All the lipids (1 - 5) formed stable suspensions in water which showed the presence of membranous aggregates as revealed by electron microscopy (TEM). The lipids 1, 2, and 4 showed distinct spherical aggregates in TEM, whereas 3 exhibited particles of irregular morphologies. The lipid suspensions were further characterized by dynamic light scattering and zeta potential measurements. Except for lipid 3, zeta potentials of such lipid aggregates were found to be substantially lower than their diether analogue, 5. X-ray diffraction studies with the lipid cast films revealed that incorporation of <b>oxyethylene</b> units at the linkages increased the unit bilayer thickness of the membranous assemblies.

These tails are poorly miscible and likely to micro-segregate if the surfactant molecules assemble. Lamellar aggregates appear at CB-B 2 ES concentrations higher than 5 wt% and were found to undergo repeat formation/breakdown periodically at 30 ˚C, with an average domain lifetime of ~ 10 seconds. To investigate effects of the temperature-sensitive <b>oxyethylene</b> units on the hydrophilic/lipophilic balance (HLB) of the CB-B 2 ES bilayers, a fluorescence probe 1 -pyrene-carboxaldehide was solubilized in the mixtures to sense the micro-environmental polarities. Fluorimetric measurements suggested that the polarity of CB-B 2 ES bilayers is very similar as for the non-ethoxylated CB-B 2 ES analogue at high temperatures (≥ 65 ºC). However, for CB-B 2 ES polarity increased with decreasing temperature, in contrast to the small decrease in polarity observed for analogous non-ethoxylated bilayers. This is consistent with increased hydration of the <b>oxyethylene</b> units in CB-B 2 ES bilayers at low temperatures. The periodic formation/breakdown and the cooling-induced hydrophilicity of the CB-B 2 ES lamellar aggregates, did not appear in the non-hybrid and/or non-ethoxylated surfactant systems.

40|$|New {{thermally}} resistant nanocomposite organokaolinite material {{have been}} prepared and characterized. The preparation method for these materials generally involves first expanding the kaolinite interlayers with an intercalating agent such as dimethyl sulfoxide, followed by reaction with a given reagent in the interlayer space of the expanded kaolinite. In many cases the interlamellar surface of kaolinite was chemically modified through the grafting of organic units on the mineral surface. One new class of organokaolinite material was proposed to be formed through the interlayer condensation reaction between an alcohol group of the attacking species and an interlayer surface aluminol group of the kaolinite host to form Al-O-C linkages between the mineral and the organic components. In this manner, new chemically robust methoxy and ethylene glycol functionalized organokaolinites were prepared, with basal spacing of 8. 2 A and 9. 4 A respectively. Furthermore, a new family of <b>oxyethylene</b> (-OCH 2 CH 2 -) based organokaolinite material was prepared and characterized. These materials include the species 15 -crown- 5 and 18 -crown- 6 as well as polyethylene glycol chains (MW 3400) which have been successfully incorporated into the interlayers of kaolinite.

For a successful gene delivery system, these NA vehicles need to comprise several functionalities. This work focuses on the modification of oligoaminoamide carriers with hydrophilic oligomer blocks mediating nanoparticle shielding potential, which is necessary to prevent aggregation or dissociation of NA polyplexes in vitro, and hinder opsonization with blood components in vivo. Herein, the shielding agent polyethylene glycol (PEG) in three defined lengths (12, 24, or 48 <b>oxyethylene</b> repeats) is compared with two peptidic shielding blocks composed of four or eight repeats of sequential proline-alanine-serine (PAS). With both types of shielding agents, we found opposing effects {{of the length of}} hydrophilic segments on shielding and compaction of formed plasmid DNA (pDNA) nanoparticles. Two-arm oligoaminoamides with 37 cationizable nitrogens linked to 12 <b>oxyethylene</b> units or four PAS repeats resulted in very compact 40 – 50 nm pDNA nanoparticles, whereas longer shielding molecules destabilize the investigated polyplexes.

Plasmid DNA (pDNA) -encapsulating liposomes were prepared by mixing an ethanol solution of the lipids with an aqueous solution of pDNA. The zeta potentials and cellular uptake efficiency of the cationic liposomes containing each synthetic lipid were almost equivalent. However, the cationic lipids with the hydrophobic spacer were subject to fuse with biomembrane-mimicking liposomes. 1, 5 -Dihexadecyl-N-lysyl-N-heptyl-l-glutamate, having a seven carbon atom spacer, exhibited the highest fusogenic potential among the synthetic lipids.

The aim of this study has been to study the properties of stabilizers in colloidal dispersions with respect to adsorption and kinetics, mainly by means of nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry and diffusometry. The conformation of adsorbed non-ionic stabilizers was analyzed in terms of NMR relaxation times, where it was found that long <b>oxyethylene</b> chains adsorb in a tail, train, loop conformation, while shorter chains have more rigid conformation. From comparative adsorption studies of nonylphenol ethoxylates with an average of 84 (NP 100) and 10 (NP 10) <b>oxyethylene</b> units together with polyethylene glycols, the results showed the importance of the hydrophobic group on the conformation.

30|$|Based on the {{chemical}} structures {{different types of}} soil release finishes based on polymers containing carboxyl groups or <b>oxyethylene</b> or hydroxyl groups are starch, carboxy-methylcellulose (CMC), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl starch, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and hydrolysed cellulose acetates etc were formulated. Fluorine based compounds containing hydrophilic moities such as polyoxyethylene, hybrid fluorochemical etc. act as soil release agents. The performance characteristics of fabrics treated with these soil release finishes can be evaluated through oily soil-release testing (Cooke 1987; Schindler and Hauser 2004; Heywood 2003, Kissa 1984; Buck and Schubert 2009).|$|E
30|$|Adsorption of polymer {{can also}} provide surface {{hydrophobicity}} of silica nanoparticles. This was demonstrated by Reculusa et al. [151] when they modified the surface of silica nanoparticles by adsorption of an <b>oxyethylene</b> based macromonomers. Hydrogen bond with the silanol functions present {{on the surface of}} the silica was formed. This was possible due to the hydrophilic nature of the monomers due to the presence of ethylene oxide group. On the other hand, the methacrylate group which contains a polymerizable group for the syrene reaction might also be responsible.|$|E
