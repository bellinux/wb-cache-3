According to Rhys, Mwngs lyrics—which he considers to be some of his best—were written [...] "very simply" [...] and convey simple messages. The singer {{made an effort to}} be economical with his words, not communicating a lot of information with them. Rhys feels that the album is accessible to non-Welsh speakers, citing his own experience of listening to Nirvana: [...] "If I listen to a Nirvana record I don't understand most of their lyrics cos he's just screaming away, but I just understand the frustration and the passion in his voice. I think equally people can get <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> record by just hitting on the mood of the song, or connecting to the mood of the song." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{positively}} {{received the}} song, complimenting Minaj's cameo and the track's production and lyrics. Andrew Winistorfer of Prefix Magazine thought that Usher {{should have gone}} with [...] "Lil Freak" [...] as the album's first big single, saying, [...] "It (OMG) doesn't come close to matching the filthy heights of [...] "Little Freak ..." [...] He also said the song was [...] "by a wide margin, the best track to be leaked from Usher's long-delayed Raymond vs. Raymond album". In his initial reaction, he pointed out flaws of the song, but said that the song [...] "could become unavoidable if it gets traction on radio". Chris Ryan of MTV News called the song, [...] "slick, sexy hip-hop-infused R done to its finest". He also called the song [...] "nothing short of freak nasty," [...] and [...] "is so full of sexy sexuality that it's enough to make Tiger Woods blush". Vibe magazine commented that [...] "wedding ring is definitely <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> Usher cut", and that Nicki Minaj stole {{the scene in the}} song. Pitchfork Media commented favourably on the songs explicit nature, stating the song [...] "isn't some R. Kelly-esque devotional hymn to sexual addiction", and that [...] "The whole towering mess makes a drunken 3 a.m. threesome sound like the most epic endeavor anyone could hope for.." [...] The review also compared the song to Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", stating, [...] "it pushes into [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] territory {{for the same reason that}} [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] transcended: the gigantic, operatic backing track".|$|E
