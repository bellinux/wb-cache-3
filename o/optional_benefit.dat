Horses that test positive for equine infectious anemia, that are quarantined for life rather than euthanized, will be freeze branded for permanent identification. Race horses of any breed are usually required by state racing commissions to have a lip tattoo, to be identified at the track. Some breed associations have, at times, offered freeze branding as either a requirement for registration or simply as an <b>optional</b> <b>benefit</b> to members, and individual horse owners may choose branding as a means by which to permanently identify their animals. As of 2011, the issue of whether to mandate horses be implanted with RFID microchips under the National Animal Identification System generated considerable controversy in the United States.|$|E

Despite this, very {{little is known about}} the largest program that delivers personal care: the Medicaid State Plan personal care services (PCS) <b>optional</b> <b>benefit.</b> This paper presents the latest available national program (participant and expenditure) trend data (1999 – 2002) on the Medicaid PCS benefit and findings from a national survey of eligibility and cost control policies in use on the program. The program trends show that, over the study period, the number of states providing the Medicaid PCS benefit grew by four (from 26 to 30), and national program participation, adjusted for population growth, increased by 27 %. However, inflation-adjusted program expenditures per participant declined by 3 % between 1999 and 2002. Findings from the policy survey reveal that between 1999 and 2002 there was a marked decline in the range of services provided, and by 2004, almost half the programs operated a cap on the hours of services provided...|$|E

With an individual policy, the insured person is generally the policy holder. With a group plan, the employer is the policy holder. An individual policy can provide several <b>optional</b> <b>benefits</b> in addition to disability benefits, which are not available in a group plan. In assessing risk, the insurer uses the application, the agent's report, a physical examination, the attending physician's report, and sometimes a consumer investigation company's inspection report.

40|$|State Medicaid {{programs}} {{and other state}} health agencies need to monitor and evaluate changes in health insurance coverage, access to care, financing, {{and the quality of}} health care delivery. The availability of new financial resources through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is accompanied by raised expectations for such accountability. While state agencies often contract with universities on an ad hoc basis for specific policy projects, fourteen states have established formal stateuniversity partnerships so that their analytic and technical needs can be addressed more readily. After a brief overview of these partnerships, this article provides examples of their projects, which most often affect Medicaid policy, including work on program eligibility, provider payments, and <b>optional</b> <b>benefits.</b> State-university partnerships are working on policy-relevant projects that influence decision making. Like the variation in Medicaid programs across the country, no two partnerships are alike. They thrive in a mix of structures, using different means of contracting, and with varied degrees of data access. All partnerships are interested in building a national network to share innovative practices and projects, spawn comparative policy studies across states, and support the development of new state-university partnerships. © 2014 by Duke University Press...|$|R

Considerable attention {{has focused on the}} decision's implications for Medicaid, the dominant public program supporting long-term care institutional, home, and community-based services. Although Medicaid spending for home and community-based service is growing, these are largely <b>optional</b> <b>benefits</b> that states may or may not choose to offer, and states vary widely in {{the degree to which they}} cover them. The implications of the Olmstead decision [...] in terms of the scope and the nature of states' obligation to provide home and community-based long-term care services [...] are still unfolding. Although the Supreme Court ruled that providing care in institutional settings may violate the ADA, it also recognized that there are limits to what states can do, given the available resources and the obligation to provide a range of services for disabled people. The decision left many open questions for states and lower courts to resolve. State programs also may be influenced over time as dozens of lawsuits and hundreds of formal complaints seeking access to appropriate services are resolved. ...|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, {{the impact}} of program {{generosity}} on per enrollee Medicaid spending by state is examined {{through a combination of}} descriptive and econometric analyses. The dissertation employs a unique dataset that compiles a variety of Medicaid program data, including per enrollee spending and Medicaid program characteristics, covering the period 2002 - 2004. Generosity indicators are constructed to quantitatively measure differences in program generosity across three dimensions: <b>optional</b> <b>benefits,</b> eligibility rules, and physician fees. These indicators are the variables of interest in the econometric analysis of per enrollee Medicaid spending, while additionally controlling for relevant economic, demographic, health supply, ideology, and policy variables. Analysis of the variation in per enrollee Medicaid spending by service and by Basis of Eligibility (BOE), measured by the coefficient of variation, demonstrated that the magnitude of variation in each service or BOE category was inversely related to the magnitude of per enrollee spending. In other words, the services and eligibility groups with the lowest per enrollee spending demonstrate the greatest level of variation. Overall variation most closely resembles that of the categories with the highest spending. As a result, any effort to reduce variation would have to focus on those service or eligibility groups where per enrollee spending is highest. No one state is most or least generous across indicators, nor is generosity (or lack thereof) an absolute predictor of per enrollee spending. The generosity indicators, plus year dummies, control for about 13 percent of variation in per enrollee Medicaid spending. The complete spending model controls for 63 percent of the variation in per enrollee Medicaid spending. Economic and ideology variables control for the largest share of the variation in per enrollee Medicaid spending...|$|R

40|$|Medicaid, Americaâ€™s largest {{government-funded}} {{health insurance}} program, plays {{a pivotal role}} in providing health services to eight million adults with disabilities. Since the mid- 1990 s, many Medicaid programs have aggressively introduced managed care, which reconfigures service delivery using business principles. Most states have insufficient experience in developing managed care plans for Medicaid beneficiaries with disabilities. Middle-aged adults with physical disabilities present their own constellation of health care issues that is not readily appreciated in health and social services research. This qualitative research examined the implications of Medicaid managed care by conducting in-depth interviews with a total of thirty respondents with physical disabilities in the age range of 45 - 64 years enrolled in a mandatory managed care program in the eastern seaboard of United States. The {{purpose of the study was}} to understand their experiences in accessing physical health care services and to ascertain the effects of managed care on their health and well-being. This study found beneficiaries encounter numerous barriers in accessing preventative, treatment, and acute care services. Overall, access to care is difficult when the required service is expensive (eg. new wheelchairs, repairs to wheelchairs, special beds, and expensive medications). When services are delayed or denied, physical conditions, emotional and economic well-being, and social participation are negatively affected. Although the lived realities of accessing managed care services that surfaced in this study can be viewed as reasonably representative of the experiences of disabled Medicaid beneficiaries given the cross-disability nature of the sample, the study does not claim generalizability across the country. States have considerable latitude in designing their Medicaid programs through decisions such as eligible services, calculation of income and assets for enrollment, and <b>optional</b> categories for <b>benefits.</b> As Medicaid programs face uncertainty in coming years, first-hand accounts of the most vulnerable populations provide invaluable insights to evaluate the consequences of neo-liberal health reforms.
