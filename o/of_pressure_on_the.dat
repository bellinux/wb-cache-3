25|$|The {{pressure}} transmitting {{medium is}} an important component in any high-pressure experiment. The medium fills the space within the sample 'chamber' and applies the pressure being transmitted to the medium onto to the sample. In a good high-pressure experiment, the medium should maintain a homogeneous distribution <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sample. In other words, the medium must stay hydrostatic to ensure uniform compressibility of the sample. Once a pressure transmitting medium has lost its hydrostaticity, a pressure gradient forms in the chamber that increases with increasing pressure. This gradient can greatly affect the sample, compromising results. The medium must also be inert, as to not interact with the sample, and stable under high pressures. For experiments with laser heating, the medium should have low thermal conductivity. If an optical technique is being employed, the medium should be optically transparent and for x-ray diffraction, the medium should be a poor x-ray scatterer – as to not contribute to the signal.|$|E

They confirmed that he weighed , and measured his height as [...] A thorough medical examination found that his bodily functions worked correctly, and that he breathed freely. Lambert was described as active and mentally alert, well-read, and with an excellent memory. He was fond of singing, and had a normal speaking voice which showed no signs <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lungs. Doctors found tumefaction of his feet, legs and thighs, and accumulation of fat within the abdomen, but other than scaly and thickened skin on his legs caused by previous attacks of erysipelas, he had no health problems. Lambert told the doctors that he ate normal quantities of ordinary food. He claimed that since about 1795 he had drunk nothing but water, and that even while young, and a regular party-goer, he did not join his fellow revellers in drinking. Lambert estimated that he was able to walk about a quarter of a mile (400m) without difficulty. He slept regularly for no more than eight hours per night, always with his window open, and was never heard to snore; on waking he was always fully alert within five minutes, and he never napped during the day.|$|E

2500|$|SCO is also {{influenced}} by the application of pressure which changes {{the population of the}} HS and LS states. [...] Upon application of pressure, a conversion from the HS state to the LS state and a shift from T1/2, (the temperature at which half of the complex is in a LS state), to higher temperatures will occur. [...] This is due to an increase in the zero point energy difference, ΔE°HL, caused by an increase in the relative vertical displacement of the potential wells and a decrease in the activation energy, ΔW°HL, which favors the LS state. Figure 14 shows a schematic of the pressure influence on an FeII-L compound and Figure 15 shows the effect <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> magnetic susceptibility of Fe(phen)2(SCN)2.
