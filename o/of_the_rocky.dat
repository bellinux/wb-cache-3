5|$|Denver {{lies within}} the semi-arid, {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen climate classification BSk). It has four distinct seasons and receives a modest {{amount of precipitation}} spread throughout the year. Due to its inland location on the High Plains, at the foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountains, Denver, like all cities along the eastern edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountains, is subject to sudden changes in weather. Contrary to the popular belief that Denver receives 300 days of sunshine a year, the city can actually expect to receive an average of 115 clear days, 130 partly cloudy days, and 120 cloudy days each year.|$|E

25|$|Quite often, {{when the}} Pacific Northwest coast is being drenched by rain, <b>the</b> {{windward}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rockies</b> is being hammered by snow (as the air loses its moisture), and <b>the</b> leeward side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rockies</b> in Alberta is basking in a föhn Chinook.

5|$|Several {{species of}} grasshoppers, {{including}} especially the following, swarm as locusts {{in different parts}} of the world, on all continents except Antarctica (and since the extinction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountain locust, North America): For example, the Australian plague locust (Chortoicetes terminifera) swarms across Australia.|$|E

5|$|Crinipellis zonata is saprobic, {{living on}} the debris or roots of hardwoods; it {{contains}} wood-decaying enzymes that can break down the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pyrene.

In North America, it is distributed east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountains, and has been recorded as far west as Indiana and Texas. In Europe, it has been collected in Portugal.

25|$|<b>The</b> {{western edge}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rockies</b> {{includes}} ranges {{such as the}} Wasatch near Salt Lake City and the Bitterroots along the Idaho-Montana border. The Great Basin and Columbia River Plateau separate these sub-ranges from distinct ranges further to the west, most prominent among which are the Sierra Nevada, Cascade Range and Coast Mountains. <b>The</b> <b>Rockies</b> do not extend into the Yukon or Alaska, or into central British Columbia, where <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountain System (but not <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountains) includes <b>the</b> Columbia Mountains, <b>the</b> southward extension <b>of</b> which is considered part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rockies</b> in <b>the</b> United States. <b>The</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountain System within the United States is a United States physiographic region; <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountain System is known in Canada as the Eastern System.|$|R

50|$|Ecologists divide <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountain into {{a number}} of biotic zones, defined by whether they can support trees, and <b>the</b> {{presence}} <b>of</b> one or more indicator species. Areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rockies</b> that do not support or have few trees include <b>the</b> prairie <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern foothills and the Alpine tundra. The foothill prairie grassland lies to <b>the</b> east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rockies</b> where <b>the</b> mountains fall to meet the Great Plains at <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountain Front (below roughly 1800 ft). Alpine tundra meanwhile occurs in regions above the treeline, which varies from 12000 ft in New Mexico to 2500 ft at the northern end (near the Yukon).|$|R
5|$|Populations of Gyromitra esculenta {{appear to}} vary {{geographically}} in their toxicity.

However, poisonings in the west have been reported, although less frequently than in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Cripple Creek strike also {{transformed}} the Western Federation of Miners enormously {{as a political}} entity. The year-old union, weak and penniless before the strike, became widely admired among miners throughout the West. Thousands of workers joined the union {{over the next few}} years.

5|$|The northwestern crow (C. caurinus) is {{very closely}} related to the American crow. Its {{ancestors}} became separated by Ice Age glaciation west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountains.

5|$|The species occurs {{throughout}} the Northern Hemisphere, in Europe, North America, and Asia. In North America, {{it is more}} common east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountains.

5|$|Tylopilus alboater, {{commonly}} known as the black velvet bolete, is a bolete fungus in the Boletaceae family.

A mycorrhizal species, it grows solitarily, scattered, or in groups on the ground usually under deciduous trees, particularly oak, although it has been recorded from deciduous, coniferous, and mixed forests.|$|E

5|$|A relict species nearly exterminated by {{the last}} ice age, box {{huckleberry}} is self-sterile, and is found in isolated colonies which reproduce clonally by extending roots.
