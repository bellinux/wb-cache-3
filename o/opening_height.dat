40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an analytical and experimental study on the characteristics of hydraulic jump in a triangular channel. The analytical consideration is based on the momentum conservation law for the upstream and downstream sections of the jump. The experiments were carried out in a triangular channel of glass side walls with the vertex angle of 94. 4 °. A wide range of discharge and inflow Froude number were used in the experiments for two different <b>opening</b> <b>heights</b> of the upstream sluice gate. The main characteristics of the jump such as the sequent depth ratio, relative energy dissipation and water surface profile were investigated and the results were compared with those of the rectangular sections. The results showed that the triangular section is more efficient to dissipate the inflow energy. The efficiency of jump in a triangular channel is about 12 % more than a rectangular channel for the same condition. As a result, hydraulic jump in a triangular channel needs a smaller tail water depth for a given inflow jet height and Froude number. Also, empirical relations and graphs are presented to determine the characteristics of the jump in triangular section...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{structures}} that {{are surrounded by}} flowing water can experience undesirable Flow-Induced Vibrations. These vibrations {{have a record of}} negative consequences. The most important cause of vibrations is self-excitation. This is a mechanism in which the forces acting on the hydraulic gate are amplified by the movement of the hydraulic gate itself which then further increases the vibration intensity. This mechanism potentially results in structural failure of hydraulic gates. Therefore, prevention of this type of excitations should be priority number one in the design stage of hydraulic gates One of the vertical self-excitation mechanisms is the galloping-type vibration and is addressed in this thesis. In this research the possible occurrence of galloping-type vibrations of a dynamic one degree of freedom system is simulated. CFD computations were used to obtain a force matrix that served as an input for the simulation of vertical vibrations of the one degree of freedom system. This research has shown that the force matrix, obtained using CFD software, can used to derive the hydrodynamic damping coefficients due to flow and hydrodynamic stiffness coefficients due to flow and buoyancy for a range of combinations of <b>opening</b> <b>heights</b> and accompanying vertical velocities of the hydraulic gate. The damping coefficient that was required to obtain a fully stable situation for all initial <b>opening</b> <b>heights</b> complied with the results found by determining the negative hydrodynamic damping coefficients due to flow. Therefore, this research has shown that the stability to galloping-type vibrations and the required external damping coefficient can be derived from the force matrix obtained using CFD. The research performed has shown that the hydraulic gate, designed as an FRP laminate experienced roughly twice as high negative hydrodynamic damping values than a typical steel hydraulic gate consisting of a plate stiffened with ribs. This means that the FRP laminate requires twice as much external damping to neutralise the significantly higher negative hydrodynamic damping due to flow. The steel hydraulic gate experiences a larger range of negative hydrodynamic damping albeit with much lower negative hydrodynamic damping coefficients than the FRP laminate hydraulic gate. Concluding this research, results show that FRP hydraulic gates are more susceptible to galloping-type vibrations than traditional steel hydraulic gates, meaning that either the design of the hydraulic gate has to be altered or much more external damping, in this case twice as much, is required to compensate for the negative hydrodynamic damping due to flow, with respect to steel hydraulic gates.

40|$|As {{the amount}} of study into the {{terahertz}} (THz) region {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} steadily increases, the parallel plate waveguide has emerged as a simple and effective fixture to perform many experiments. The ability to concentrate THz radiation into a small area or volume enables us to analyze smaller samples and perform more repeatable measurements, which is essential for future research. While the fundamental physics of PPW transmission are understood mathematically, the practical knowledge of building such a fixture for the THz domain and taking measurements on it with a real system needs to be built up through experience. In this thesis, multiple PPW configurations are built and tested. These include waveguides of different lengths and <b>opening</b> <b>heights,</b> using lenses and antennas to focus and collect radiation from the input and output, and different amounts of polish on the waveguide surface. A basic resonator structure is also built and measured as a proof of concept for future research. The two most useful propagation modes through the waveguide, the lowest order transverse magnetic (TEM) and transverse electric (TE) modes, were characterized on all of the setups. Additionally, a flexible fixture was designed and measured which will allow future work in the THz field to be much more reliable and repeatable...|$|R
