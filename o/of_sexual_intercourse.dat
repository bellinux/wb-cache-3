40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective. Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that early age <b>of</b> first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify a set of risk behaviors and partner characteristics that mediate the association between age <b>of</b> first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> and subsequent HPV infection in adolescent and young adult women. Methods. Female university students completed surveys and underwent HPV testing every 6 months for up to 3 years. HPV-positive participants were matched to HPV-negative participants (252 pairs, total N � 504). Associations were examined between risk behaviors/partner characteristics and both age <b>of</b> first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> and HPV infection. Those variables associated with either age <b>of</b> first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> or HPV infection were entered into a generalized estimating equation (to account for the matched study design) modeling the association between age <b>of</b> first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> and HPV infection. Results. Mean age <b>of</b> first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> was 16. 7 (� 1. 8) years, and early age <b>of</b> first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> was associated significantly with HPV infection (� �� 0. 20; odds ratio: 0. 82; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 74 – 0. 90). The association was mediated by number <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> partners in the past 6 months, history of sexually transmitted infection, alcohol and drug use related to sexual behaviors, and partner’s number <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> partners. Conclusion. A set of behavioral risk factors and partner characteristics partially mediate the association between age <b>of</b> first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> and subsequent HPV infection.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the association between psychosocial development and the timing <b>of</b> first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> {{in a sample of}} White, rural adolescents. Two theoretical models were tested. The first model, derived from problem behavior theory, proposed that earlier timing <b>of</b> first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> is associated with longitudinal patterns of transition proneness and poor psychosocial adjustment. The second model, the stage termination model, proposed that early first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> interferes with subsequent development, thereby resulting in negative developmental outcomes. problem behavior theory was supported. For both boys and girls, earlier timing <b>of</b> first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> was associated with longitudinal patterns of greater transition proneness and poorer psychosocial adjustment. The stage termination model was not supported. No evidence was found suggesting that early timing <b>of</b> first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> results in negative psychosocial outcomes...|$|R

5|$|As {{with many}} Korean rural folk traditions, {{the sport is}} {{regarded}} as a predictor of future events, specifically harvests. The outcome of a ritualised contest between the two sides of a village (East and West) was seen as an indicator of the abundance (or otherwise) of that year's rice crop, which would be harvested in the autumn; as a result, juldarigi and similar folk sports are predominant in the rice-growing areas of the South. This is due to the common association in Southeast Asia between dragons (which the ropes of the juldarigi are thought to resemble) and rain; as a result juldarigi or similar tug-of-war ceremonies have also historically been staged during periods of drought. The connection of the two ropes used (with one rope's smaller loop being placed through the other's larger loop) is reminiscent <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse,</b> which also gives rise to the sport's association with fecundity.|$|E
5|$|Her book Intercourse, which {{addresses}} the role <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> in society, {{has been interpreted}} as opposing all heterosexual intercourse, but Dworkin said it does not and that what she was against was male domination by intercourse. Some critics of Dworkin accused her of supporting incest, and she sued for defamation, but a court did not forbid the criticism. She subsequently wrote much in opposition to incest. She wrote some fiction, some of which was held for a time by Canadian customs authorities before it was released, giving rise to a controversy over whether her support for antipornography law had led to the seizure of her own work. When {{she said she was}} drugged and raped in a hotel in 1999, controversy over the truth of the allegations followed. In her later years, she suffered from severe osteoarthritis, which limited her mobility. She died of acute myocarditis at the age of 58.|$|E
5|$|Stone and Blackwell {{developed}} a private agreement aimed at preserving and protecting Stone’s financial independence and personal liberty. In monetary matters, {{they agreed that}} the marriage be like a business partnership, with the partners being “joint proprietors of everything except the results of previous labors.” Neither would have claim to lands belonging to the other, nor any obligation for the other’s costs of holding them. While married and living together they would share earnings, but if they should separate, they would relinquish claim to the other’s subsequent earnings. Each would {{have the right to}} will their property to whomever they pleased unless they had children. Over Blackwell’s objections, Stone refused to be supported and insisted on paying half of their mutual expenses. In addition to financial independence, Stone and Blackwell agreed that each would enjoy personal independence and autonomy: “Neither partner shall attempt to fix the residence, employment, or habits of the other, nor shall either partner feel bound to live together any longer than is agreeable to both.” During their discussion of marriage, Stone had given Blackwell a copy of Henry C. Wright’s book Marriage and Parentage; Or, The Reproductive Element in Man, as a Means to His Elevation and Happiness, and asked him to accept its principles as what she considered the relationship between husband and wife should be. Wright proposed that because women bore the results <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse,</b> wives should govern a couple’s marital relations. In accordance with that view, Blackwell agreed that Stone would choose “when, where and how often” she would “become a mother.” In addition to this private agreement, Blackwell drew up a protest of laws, rules, and customs that conferred superior rights on husbands and, as part of the wedding ceremony, pledged never to avail himself of those laws.|$|E

Specifically, we examined the relationships of developmental assets with age <b>of</b> first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> among a large sample (n = 1061) of adolescent African American males living in low-income neighborhoods in Mobile, Alabama. Methods: Using the Developmental Asset Model as a theoretical guide, we selected variables from adolescent survey data and conducted logistic regression analysis to determine predictors of early age <b>of</b> first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse.</b> Results: Nearly one half (49 %) of the male survey participants reported that they first had <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> at the age of 12 or younger. The total number of assets was the strongest predictor of later age (13 years old or later) <b>of</b> first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> (OR 1. 49, 95 % CI = 1. 09, 2. 04), followed by decision-making skills (OR 1. 40, 95 % CI = 1. 04, 1. 86), and positive view of the future (OR 1. 36, 95 % CI = 1. 02, 1. 74).

There is a decrease in frequency <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourses,</b> a decrease in female orgasm sensation and a decrease in satisfaction with the sexual life during pregnancy. Frequency <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> dysfunctions increases: dyspareunia, insufficient lubrication and hypogastrium pain. Females with significant dyspareunia before pregnancy have higher risk of extensive injury to the vaginal wall during labour. 10 % of women do not have full comfort of life due to birth injury six months after the labour. 24 % of women start with sexual life less than six weeks after the first labour; 7 % of women have no <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> six months after the delivery. 38 % of females declare that the sexual life six months after the delivery is still not as highquality as prior to pregnancy.
