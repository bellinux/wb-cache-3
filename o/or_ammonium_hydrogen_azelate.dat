40|$|Direct Chemical Oxidation (DCO) is an ambient-pressure, {{low-temperature}} (< 100 C), and aqueous-based {{process for}} general-purpose {{destruction of the}} organic fraction of hazardous or mixed waste. It uses the peroxydisulfate anion (S{sub 2 }O{sub 8 }{sup 2 {minus}}) in acid or base solutions. The byproduct of the oxidation reaction, typically sodium <b>or</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> sulfate, may be recycled electrolytically to produce the oxidant. The oxidation kinetic reaction is first order {{with respect to the}} peroxydisulfate concentration, expressed in equivalents. The rate constant is constant for nearly all dissolved organic compounds: k{sub a} = 0. 01 {+-} 0. 005 min{sup {minus} 1 }. This reflects a common rate-determining step, which is the decomposition of the peroxydisulfate anion into the chemically active derivative, the sulfate radical anion, SO{sub 4 }{sup {minus}}. This decomposition is promoted in DCO by raising the operating temperature into the range of 80 - 100 C. Rates are given for approximately 30 substances with diverse functional groups at low concentrations, and for a number of solid and liquid wastes typical of nuclear and chemical industries. The process has been scale up for treatment studies on chlorinated hydrocarbons, in which the hydrolysis of solvent mixtures was followed by oxidation of products in a series of stirred tank reactors. Cost estimates, safety considerations, and a comprehensive bibliography are given...|$|R
40|$|The number {{concentration}} and size-resolved properties of acidic ultrafine particles {{have been observed}} to more closely associate with adverse health effects than do indices of total particulate mass. However, no reliable measurement techniques are currently available to quantify the {{number concentration}} and the size distribution of ambient acidic ultrafine particles. In this study, a method {{with the use of}} iron nanofilm detectors for enumeration and size measurement of acid aerosols is developed and refined. Standard sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) <b>or</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> sulfate (NH 4 HSO 4) droplets and sulfuric acid-coated particles were generated and deposited on the detectors causing reaction spots. The dimensions of the reaction spots were examined with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to establish the correlations between the diameter of the particle {{and the size of the}} reaction spot. To validate this method, field measurements were conducted from September 06 to November 30, 2010, at Tai Mo Shan in Hong Kong. The results indicated that the particle number concentrations obtained from the AFM scanning of the exposed detectors via scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) and electrostatic precipitator (ESP) collection were comparable to those derived from the SMPS + CPC (condensation particle counter) measurements (p > 0. 05). The average geometric mean diameter of particles at peak measured by the SMPS + CPC and the detectors scanned by the AFM was 52. 3 ± 6. 9 nm and 51. 9 ± 3. 1 nm, respectively, showing good agreement. It is suggested that the iron nanofilm detectors could be a reliable tool for the measurement and analysis of acidic particles in the atmosphere.

40|$|Chemiluminescence (CL) {{phenomena}} of carbonates or bicarbonates of potassium, sodium, <b>or</b> <b>ammonium</b> with <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide {{in the presence}} of cobalt sulfate were reported. After cobalt(II) solution was injected into the mixture of carbonate/bicarbonate and hydrogen peroxide, a CL signal was given out briefly. The CL conditions of these systems were optimized. The CL reaction mechanisms were studied experimentally by examining the spectrum emitted by the CL system and the effect of various free radical scavengers on CL emission intensity. The results showed that the maximal emission wavelengths of the CO 32 [...] H 2 O 2 -Co 2 + and HCO 3 [...] H 2 O 2 -Co 2 + systems were 440 and 490 nm, respectively. As a result, a radical scavenger of ascorbic acid, thiourea, and superoxide dismutase exhibited different effects on these CL systems.

40|$|Icacinaoliviformisis common shrub {{found in}} the Northern Regions of Ghana. It has {{received}} very little attention regarding its use as feed supplement for ruminants. This study was carried out to determine the chemical composition and potential digestibility of the leaves of Icacinaoliviformis (IOL) when incubated with <b>or</b> without <b>ammonium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> carbonate (NH 4 HCO 3) in the media. The media with (NH 4 HCO 3) {{was referred to as}} nitrogen sufficient (NS) and the one without (NH 4 HCO 3) was nitrogen deficient (ND). The results of the study showed that IOL had a dry matter content of 377. 3 g/Kg with a crude protein content of 173 g/kg. The NDF, ADF and ADL were 439. 5, 393. 5 and 191. 9 g/kg respectively. The gross energy content was estimated to be 18. 4 MJ/Kg DM. There was no significant difference (p> 0. 05) between the ND and NS media for all the parameters measured except for ammonium nitrogen where the NS was significantly (p= 0. 021) higher than the ND. The potential degradability recorded for the IOL in both ND and NS media was 158. 47 and 170. 93 respectively. The rate of degradability of the ND was 0. 055 and that of NS was 0. 043.
