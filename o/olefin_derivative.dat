In {{methanol}} at 60 °C, complex 2 is in equilibrium with its alkylidene isomer [ÓsTp(=CHCH 2 -C 5 H 4 N) (P iPr 3) ]BF 4 (3). The rearrangement takes place via the intermediates OsTp(CH 2 CH(OMe) -C 5 H 4 N) (PiPr 3) (4) and OsTp(CHCH-CsH 4 N) (P 1 Pr 3) (5), which have been isolated and characterized. The ruthenium complex [RuTp(κ 1 -OCMe 2) 2 (PiPr 3) ]BF 4 (6) reacts with 2 -vinylpyridine, {{in a similar manner}} to 1, to give [RuTp(η 2 -CH 2 =CH-C 5 H 4 N) (PiPr 3) ]BF 4 (7). Like its osmium counterpart, complex 7 is transformed in an alkylidene species [RuTp(-CHCH 2 -C 5 H 4 N) (PiPr 3) ]BF 4 (10), via the ruthenium analogue to 4 and 5, RuTP(CH 2 CH(OMe) -C 5 H 4 N](PiPr 3) (8), and RuTp(CHCH-C 5 H 4 N](PiPr 3) (9). In contrast to 1 and 6, the cyclopentadienyl derivative [OsCp(CH 3 CN) 2 (PiPr 3) ]PF 6 (11) reacts with 2 vinylpyridine to give the hydride- 3 -osmaindolizine derivative [OsHCp(CHCH-C 5 H 4 N) (PiPr 3) JPF 6 (12), by C-H bond activation of the CH 2 group of the substituent of the heterocycle. Treatment of 12 with NaOMe in THF gives OsCp(CHCH-C 5 H 4 N) (PiPr 3) (13), which can also be prepared by reaction of OsCpCl(PiPr 3) 2 (14) with 2 -vinylpyridine. Protonation of 13 initially gives the alkylidene cation [OsCp(=CHCH 2 -C 5 H 4 N) (P iPr 3) ]+ (15), which isomerizes into the olefin species [ÓsCp(η 2 -CH 2 =CH-C 5 H 4 N) (PiPr 3) ]+ (16).

30|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of oil {{refinery}} capacity, the production of C 4 hydrocarbons, as by-products from FCC or hydrocracking, also increases. It is reported that the C 4 hydrocarbon output of China alone in 2013 was 15.7 million tons [1]. Therefore, increasing attentions is being paid on the consumption of C 4 hydrocarbons during refinery and petrochemical processes. However, the consumption of these C 4 hydrocarbons is currently focused on butylenes because they can be converted for MTBE manufacturing. But the butanes, the amount of which is nearly equal to the amount of butylenes in the C 4 hydrocarbon mixtures [1], can only be burned as uneconomic fuels. On the other hand, with the expansion of C 4 <b>olefin</b> <b>derivatives</b> production, demand for butylenes increases gradually.

The VCD and absorption spectra in the first two regions are analyzed by use of current density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The NIR region is analyzed by a protocol that consists of the use of DFT-based calculations and in assuming local mode behavior: the local mode approach is found appropriate for interpreting the absorption spectra and, for the moment, acceptable for calculating NIR-VCD spectra.

Stirring of toluene solutions of 3 {{in the presence of}} neutral aluminum oxide initially produces the dehydration of the vinylidene ligand to give the alkynyl-allenylidene OsTp{C≡CC(OH) Ph 2 }(=C=C=CPh 2) (PiPr 3) (4), which subsequently undergoes a Meyer-Schuster rearrangement to yield the acyl-allenylidene OsTp{C(O) CH=CPh 2 }(=C=C=CPh 2) (PiPr 3) (5). In toluene, at 60 °C, the B-H bond of the Tp ligand of 5 abstracts the allene from the osmium coordination sphere by means of a 1, 1 -hydroboration of the Os-Cα double bond. As a result, the acyl decarbonylation takes place to form Os(Ph 2 C=C=CHTp) (CH=CPh 2) (CO) (P iPr 3) (6). In acetonitrile at 60 °C, the allene tautomerizes into the alkyne to afford Os(Ph 2 HCC≡CTp) (CH= CPh 2) (CO) (PiPr 3) (7). The abstraction modifies the reactivity of the system toward HBF 4. Thus, while the protonation of 5 leads to the alkylidyne [OsTp{C(O) CH=CPh 2 }(≡CCH=CPh 2) (PiPr 3) ]BF 4 (8), the protonation of 6 and 7 gives the alkylidenes [Os(Ph 2 C=C=CHTp) (=CHCHPh 2) (CO) (PiPr 3) ]BF 4 (9) and [Os(Ph 2 HCC≡CTp) (=CHCHPh 2) (CO) (PiPr 3) ]BF 4 (10).

The complexes 2 a and 2 b catalyze the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of highly strained nonfunctionalized cyclic olefins to give polymers with relatively high polydispersity indices, high molecular weights and over 80 % Z configuration of the double bonds in the chain backbone.

40|$|A {{modified}} Urey—Bradley {{potential energy}} function comprised of quadratic terms for bond stretches, bond‐angle bends, and torsional displacements together with analytical expressions for pairwise nonbonded interactions {{was chosen to}} represent the force field for hydrocarbon molecules. Quadratic constants {{were taken from the}} spectroscopic U☒B analyses of Schachtschneider and Snyder [Spectrochim. Acta 19, 117 (1963) ], while the nonbonded functions adopted were those proposed by Bartell [J. Chem. Phys. 32, 827 (1960) ]. Reference bond angles for the quadratic terms were taken to be 109. 5 ° or 120 ° for tetrahedral or trigonal coordination, respectively. Reference single‐bond lengths and the torsional constant were adjusted to fit the experimental data for CH 4 and C 2 H 6. Double bonds and ring bonds in cyclopropyl compounds were considered to be rigid. The above selections served to establish a universal model force field for hydrocarbons with no remaining adjustable parameters. The potential energy functions for a variety of saturated hydrocarbons and several <b>olefins</b> and cyclopropyl <b>derivatives</b> were minimized with respect to independent structure parameters (i. e., bond stretches, bends, and internal rotations). Even though all C☒H (and C☒C) bonds were input to be identical to those in CH 4 (and C 2 H 6) except for nonbonded environment, the bond lengths and angles corresponding to the minimum potential energy exhibited an appreciable variation from molecule to molecule, as did also the strain energies of geometric and rotational isomers. Calculated trends in structures, isomerization energies, and barriers to rotation agreed quite well with experimentally observed trends, provided that experimental isomerization energies were corrected to 0 °K and zero‐point energies were taken into account. Some novel features of the results and applications of the model for predicting deformations in strained systems are discussed.

40|$|The {{increase}} in global demand for lower olefins (ethylene, propylene, and butylenes) {{coupled with the}} regional diversification of carbon raw materials bring about opportunities and challenges for emerging technologies. Crude oil has been the primary carbon feedstock for the past 50 years, but alternative carbon feedstocks, including coal, natural gas, and biomass, received considerable attention in recent years. These alternative resources could first be converted to synthesis gas, a mixture of CO and H 2. Natural gas produces H 2 -rich synthesis gas (H 2 /CO ≥ 2) while coal and biomass produce CO-rich synthesis gas (H 2 /CO < 2). Synthesis gas could subsequently be used to produce fuels and chemicals, including lower olefins and oxygenates. Lower <b>olefins</b> and their <b>derivatives</b> are essential chemical building blocks for many industries, ranging from plastics to pharmaceuticals. Currently the commercial production of lower olefins from synthesis gas is taking place via methanol (methanol-to-olefins), but direct routes, namely Oxide-Zeolite (OX-ZEO) and Fischer-Tropsch to Olefins (FTO), offer potentially higher efficiencies in volume, energy, materials, and cost. Although the Fischer Tropsch (FT) process has been developed for almost a century, its main application is liquid fuels instead of chemicals (lower olefins, oxygenates, and aromatics). The biggest challenge of the Fischer-Tropsch to Olefins (FTO) process is the product selectivity which is governed the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) distribution. The serendipitous discovery of adding Na and S promoters to supported Fe-based catalysts which led to unprecedented selectivity towards lower olefins offers {{a solution to this}} selectivity problem. The goal of this work is to design and develop catalysts for the direct production of lower olefins from synthesis gas and a two-pronged approach was used to achieve this. On one front, experimental and theoretical methods were used to understand the Fe particle size and promoters (Na and S) effects of state-of-the-art Fe-based FTO catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity and stability. These insights were then used to rationally design model Fe-based FTO catalysts which were highly active, selective and stable for direct conversion of CO-rich syngas feed to lower olefins. On the other front, Co-based FTO catalysts were developed to meet the need of directly converting H 2 -rich syngas feed to lower olefins...|$|R
40|$|Zeolite {{catalysts}} {{are used}} in a large variety of (petro-) chemical conversions. The acid sites in these materials {{are responsible for the}} chemical transformation, while their well-defined crystallographic architecture offers unique molecular size and shape selectivity. The finite availability of crude oil demands for new technologies that utilize alternative feedstocks (like biomass, natural gas or coal) for the production of chemicals. In these novel conversions zeolite catalyst can play an important role. In hydrocarbon processing, the formation of carbonaceous deposits is usually inevitable. These undesired by-products are the result of secondary reactions and influence the performance of catalyst materials with possible consequences for their industrial application. In order to develop new and improved catalytic crystals, a thorough understanding of their working principles is essential. The use of spectroscopic characterization techniques has thereby become an important tool. The research described in this PhD thesis examines coke formation processes in zeolite catalysts with in-situ micro-spectroscopic techniques. These tools are applied on large micron-sized zeolite crystals that reveal spatial and temporal heterogeneities in the coke growth process at the individual catalyst particle level. UV-Vis micro-spectroscopy identifies the chemical nature of the formed coke species, while confocal fluorescence microscopy allows studying the migration of these compounds within an individual zeolite crystal. The first part of the thesis deals with the Methanol-to-Olefin (MTO) conversion. A comparative study between H-SAPO- 34 and H-ZSM- 5 zeolite crystals illustrates the influence of the zeolite framework topology on the coke formation process. Low reaction temperatures generate mild coke formation, whereas more severe reaction conditions allow the growth of larger carbonaceous deposits. This effect is further enhanced with increasing Brønsted acid site density. Bulk analytical methods show that the model H-ZSM- 5 zeolite crystals remain active after a number of regeneration treatments and despite their large crystal dimensions display conversion characteristics that are close to the conversion activities of H-ZSM- 5 catalysts containing smaller crystal size. These zeolites are subsequently used to investigate the coke growth process during the aromatization of light naphtha (LNA) <b>derivatives.</b> <b>Olefins</b> and paraffins are thereby compared. Increasing reactant chain length generates more severe coke deposition, while methyl branching of the hydrocarbons results in coke deposits of more confined size. A catalytically inactive silicalite- 1 shell, covering the H-ZSM- 5 zeolite catalyst, prevents the formation of large carbonaceous species at the external surface of the crystal. Finally, fluorescence microscopy illustrates how the physicochemical interplay between reactant and zeolite affects the location of coke formation during the etherification of biomass-based alcohols with long linear alkenes in H-Beta zeolite crystals...|$|R

The aim of this research, hence, is to analyse the impact of Saudi Arabia’s accession to the WTO on the petrochemical industry, and to analyse whether the competitiveness of the industry is sustainable under these new circumstances. In doing so, this study also analysis the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the industry with the objective of identifying the competitive advantage of Saudi Arabian petrochemical industry by utilizing Porter’s model. The study also provides a discussion on the possible steps that the government might take towards establishing an economy conducive to foreign investment, competition for the growth of the petrochemicals industry. In responding to the aims and objectives of the study, both the qualitative and quantitative approaches were used. The qualitative analysis includes an analysis of expert opinions collected through elite interviews using semi-structured questionnaires. All these are structured to obtain the opinions of 20 participants regarding the trends and developments of the petrochemical industry and the related policies undertaken by the government. The quantitative analysis includes collecting secondary data for exports and imports of products of the industry along with relevant secondary data analysis of some of the leading petrochemical companies. The results of the analyses at various levels demonstrate that the petrochemicals industry has the potential to contribute to the gross output, diversification of the economy and the sources of earnings, and hence reducing the dependency on oil as the only source of income. In addition, the analysis shows that the industry has potential for the creation of jobs, new openings for investments in businesses, opening up the domestic markets towards certain new products and at the same time bringing down the reliance on imports. Furthermore, the qualitative analysis shows that government has already taken steps towards promotion and encouragement of FDI inflow in the industry but several other measures related to infrastructure and security factors need to be adopted. The nation already enjoys competitive advantages and benefits of location advantages apart from the cost advantage in oil extraction and petrochemicals production. Accession of Saudi Arabia to the WTO as a member country has opened the economy to the outside competition and the petrochemical industry was supposed to be getting the gains from trade and open economy. The global investors have demonstrated their optimism about investment in Saudi Arabia. The existing opportunities in the petrochemical sector will receive a boost apart from diversification of the oil-based economy. The country is gradually becoming a booming centre of petrochemical industry and the growth is exponential. Technological barriers are gradually broken and the industry is moving towards sustainable development. Owing to the competitive pricing of the natural gas sector and cheap availability of feedstock have made it a lucrative place for investment in petrochemical production. However, it will take some more years to realize the full benefit of the accession to the WTO as complementary sectors are also being developed. The membership has however opened the strengths as well as the weaknesses of Saudi’s petrochemical industry to the entire world. Thus, the membership brings on greater transparency, enabling easier and faster assessment and remedies. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
