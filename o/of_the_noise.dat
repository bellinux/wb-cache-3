5|$|The {{operation}} officially {{began when}} a lone Israeli S-199 bombed Egyptian positions in Isdud at 18:00 on June 2. Five light planes—two Fairchild 24s, two Rapides and one Bonanza—also made bombing runs between 20:25 and 21:30. The bombardment {{did not make}} an impression on the readying Israeli soldiers, and in light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> created by the Egyptian anti-aircraft guns, the Israelis considered that the plane was lucky to have survived the run. In addition, the troops were exhausted, not having had proper sleep in the four days preceding the operation. At 22:00, the Israeli forces started moving against the Egyptian positions.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{approaches}} for estimating an integrated variance and covariance in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> market microstructure noise. It {{is important to}} know a dependence <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> to construct <b>the</b> integrated variance and covariance estimators. We study a time dependence of bivariate noise processes in this paper. We propose a test statistic for <b>the</b> dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>noises</b> and an autocovariance estimator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>noises</b> and derive its asymptotic distribution. <b>The</b> asymptotic distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> autocovariance estimator provides us to another test statistic which is for significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> autocovariances and for detection whether <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> exists or not. We obtain good performances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test statistics and autocovariance estimator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>noises</b> in a finite sample through Monte Carlo simulation. In empirical illustration, we confirm that the proposed statistics and estimators capture various dependence patterns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market microstructure <b>noises.</b> test statistic; market microstructure noise; time-dependence; nonsynchronous observations; high frequency data. ...|$|R

5|$|From 1920 John Carson, {{also working}} for AT, {{began to develop}} a new way of looking at signals using the {{operational}} calculus of Heaviside which in essence is working in the frequency domain. This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel to invent many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished many of the old ideas. For instance the old telegraph engineers thought of the signal as being a single frequency and this idea persisted into the age of radio with some still believing that frequency modulation (FM) transmission could be achieved with a smaller bandwidth than the baseband signal right up until the publication of Carson's 1922 paper. Another advance concerned the nature of noise, Carson and Zobel (1923) treated noise as a random process with a continuous bandwidth, an idea that was well ahead of its time, and thus limited the amount of noise {{that it was possible to}} remove by filtering to that part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> spectrum which fell outside the passband. This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with wide-band FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry Nyquist whose thermal noise power formula is well known today.|$|E
5|$|The team {{decided to}} stay with {{two-dimensional}} graphics instead of three-dimensional graphics, believing it would help differentiate themselves from other Square Enix titles as well as better represent their vision for the game. When first approached {{with the task of}} creating the art for the game, background art director Takayuki Ohdachi thought the modern-day setting would be too boring, and opted to use highly skewed and angular images of Shibuya to avoid this; the rest of the creative team found this approach to fit the game quite well. For combat, the background of the top screen was selected for visual interest, while the bottom touchscreen background was designed to emphasize the gameplay. Ohdachi was also responsible for the artwork for the psych pins, and used a mix of pop art and tribal designs for the various graphics. Character designs were handled by Tetsuya Nomura and Gen Kobayashi. Character designs were made to match with the real-world Tokyo setting, after which their outfits were designed based on the character's personality. Kobayashi was also in charge of designing the game's non-player characters and noted how most designs made it to the final product. Hasegawa was responsible for creating the designs for the Noise creatures, and wanted to have them recognizable as creatures before they decay into skeletons. In keeping with the theme of human emotion in the game, Hasegawa selected creatures that conveyed such feelings, such as wolves and crows. Representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Noise</b> in the game required drawing the 2D sprites from several angles to match the action on screen as well as using rotoscoping on pre-rendered sprites, and took several iterations between Square Enix and Jupiter {{to make sure that the}} sprites' art matched the style of game, with Kando making the two-hour trip between Tokyo and Kyoto weekly to check on the progress.|$|E

30|$|At present, {{there are}} various {{adaptive}} filters.

In other words, {{if we want to}} estimate the process (or observation) noise variance matrix with the Sage-Husa adaptive filter, variance matrix <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observation <b>noise</b> (or <b>the</b> process <b>noise)</b> should be already known. Thus, these two variance matrices cannot be estimated simultaneously. It has limitations when the process and observation noises are both unknown.|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{electromechanical}} transducer {{based on a}} resonant-tunneling configuration that, {{with respect to the}} standard tunneling transducers, allows larger tunneling currents while using the same bias voltage.

40|$|Abstract:A partial {{discharge}} appears when <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> a transmission line insulator is polluted by an adhesion {{of a sea}} salt.
