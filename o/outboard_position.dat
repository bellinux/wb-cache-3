40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} and propose improvements to the injury mitigation systems, in near-side impacts, for 6 common sitting positions of young adolescents using a previously validated model. Methods: The evaluation was made by using a model of a complete passenger car, including head and thoraxâ€“pelvis air bags, which was impacted laterally by a barrier in 2 load cases. The SID-IIs finite element model was used for the evaluations and was seated in 6 different positions in the rear outboard seat: the nominal anthropomorphic test device (ATD) position, 1 inboard <b>position,</b> 3 <b>outboard</b> <b>positions,</b> and 1 braking (forward) position. These positions have previously been identified as common sitting positions in awake and asleep children. The studied dependent variables were head injury criterion (HIC) 36, resultant head linear acceleration, resultant head rotational acceleration, chest viscous criterion, and chest deflection. Results: The lowest head injury measures were seen in the braking positions and in the nominal ATD position, and the highest were seen in the inboard and <b>outboard</b> <b>positions.</b> The lowest chest injury measures were recorded in the inboard and nominal ATD positions, and the highest were recorded in the <b>outboard</b> and braking <b>positions.</b> The occupant in the <b>outboard</b> <b>positions</b> interfered with the air bags during their deployment. The occupant in inboard and braking positions tended to push the curtain air bag over the windowsill. Conclusions: Studies that investigate the injury mitigation effects in common sitting positions, beyond the nominal ATD position, are essential to highlight means to provide improved and robust safety for child occupants. This study was based on the SID-IIs 5 th percentile female, which has very similar anthropometry to a 50 th percentile 12 -year-old. Therefore, the conclusions of this study are applicable to many 11 -year-olds up to young adolescents, as well as to small females. The <b>outboard</b> and inboard <b>positions</b> of this study resulted in the highest head injury measures. Although all of the injury measures were only slightly higher than the nominal position, the trends suggest that, in near-side impacts, these positions should be discouraged. The extensively <b>outboard</b> <b>positions</b> resulted in unfavorable air bag positioning during deployment. The inboard position resulted in head strikes further forward of the nominal one; the curtain air bags need inflated cells at all locations of head strike...|$|R

5000|$|For {{the first}} 32 years of {{production}} {{of the first generation}} IRS, the disc brakes were mounted at the inboard ends of the driveshafts in order to minimise unsprung weight at the outboard end. The hydraulic brake calipers were mounted directly onto the differential. Care was taken to prevent heat generated by the brakes from damaging the differential output seals, although this was never totally successful. [...] The parking brake used separate mechanical calipers acting on the discs.For the 1993-1996 model XJS, the brakes were moved to the <b>outboard</b> <b>position.</b> This was achieved using the hub carriers from the Second Generation IRS, which by that time had already been in production for seven years for the XJ6 (XJ40). Moving the rear brakes outboard eliminated the heat transfer problem and allowed for easier servicing. The parking brake then used brake shoes inside a brake drum in the centre of the disc rotor.|$|E

An MFC {{to prevent any}} leakage of Argon gas, which the MFC contains, into the vacuum vessel has been designed. A stainless steel case encloses the MFC, and an exhaust tube detects any leaked Argon gas out of the vacuum vessel. MFCs will be installed behind blanket modules at upper and lower <b>outboard</b> <b>position</b> due to interface considerations with other equipment and the vacuum vessel. MFCs at the lower <b>outboard</b> <b>position</b> are located the center and {{to the rear of}} a blanket module, while MFCs at the upper <b>outboard</b> <b>position</b> are near the gap between blanket modules because of the narrow gap at that location between the modules and the vacuum vessel.

40|$|As more {{children}} {{move to the}} rear rows, {{there is a need}} to understand the rear impact environment for children to guide future regulatory and due care activities in this impact direction. A probability sample of 1, 035 restrained child occupants, aged 0 â€“ 12 years, seated in a second row <b>outboard</b> <b>position</b> in rear impact tow-away crashes, weighted to represent 10, 079 children, was collected from an on-going child specific crash surveillance system between 3 / 1 / 00 and 12 / 31 / 06. These data were analyzed to quantify the overall injury risk and the influence of both front seat occupant presence and reported front seat back deformation on injury risk. Overall risk of AIS 2 + injury for restrained child occupants seated in the rear row <b>outboard</b> <b>position</b> in rear impact crashes was 2. 3 %. Occupants were seated in front of these children in 71 % of cases and deformation of the front seat back into the childâ€™s space was reported in 8 % of cases. For those children with seatback deformation occurring directly in front of them, there was a doubling of the injury risk (4. 8 % vs. 2. 1 %, adjusted OR= 2. 4, 95 % CI= 1. 2 â€“ 4. 8). This paper provides the first population-based estimates of the injury risk of rear row-seated children in rear impact crash events and points to the importance of understanding the role of front seat back design on rear impact injury risk for both the front seat and rear seat occupants...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} organizations ONERA and DLR {{initiated a}} common programme supported by Eurocopter (EC) and Eurocopter Deutschland (ECD) as industry partners within the Active Blade Concept (ABC).

The main focus is put on the reduction of vibration and noise radiation of the complete helicopter rotor and the expansion of the flight enve-lope by the use of multi-frequency higher harmonic flap control. The first phase of the research programme was dedicated to the numerical assessment of flap geometry, radial location, and optimal control inputs. The simulations showed best results for a 15 % chord flap, with different optimal radial locations, depending on the distur-bance considered. A more inboard flap location is most suitable for vibration reduction, while for noise reduction the best results were obtained with a more <b>outboard</b> <b>position.</b> The design, manufacturing and experimental wind tunnel testing of a 4 -bladed Mach-scaled rotor model in high speed and descent flight is realized during the second phase...|$|E
40|$|Two screened, thin foil, charge {{collectors}} were mounted {{just beyond}} the plasma edge at an <b>outboard</b> <b>position</b> (below mid-plane) in the Joint European Torus, to detect lost alpha-particles during the 1997 high fusion power D-T experiments. No convincing observations of alpha-particle collection were obtained, possibly due to {{the low level of}} alpha-particle losses, but more probably because the positioning of the detector was not ideal for the high fusion power discharges which were run at high plasma current and toroidal field. Under such conditions, alpha-particles on escaping orbits leading towards the detector are highly likely to be intercepted by the nearby poloidal limiter. Moreover, a small alpha-particle signal would have been obscured by interference from a large and unexpected signal attributed here to fast neutrals leaving the plasma and ionizing in the low density scrape-off region outside the plasma boundary. The interpretation of this unexpected signal is the subject of the present paper. In all probability, it will also be encountered in any future attempts to detect lost alpha-particles in a current measuring detector unless suitable precautions are taken, e. g. provision of a thin first foil to remove light charged particles with energies below about 0. 5 MeV energy.

Results of the investigation indicate that the loading over the ailerons was established by the wing-flow characteristics, and the loading shapes were irregular in the transonic speed range. The spanwise location of the aileron {{had little effect on}} the values of the slope of the curves of hinge-moment coefficient against aileron deflection, but the inboard aileron had the greatest value of the slope of the curves of hinge-moment coefficient against angle of attack and the outboard aileron had the least.

50|$|The {{engine was}} {{initially}} a private venture put {{forward for the}} English Electric Canberra. Originally known as the AJ.65 for Axial Jet, 6,500 lbf the engine {{was based on an}} initial project concept by Alan Arnold Griffith. which combined an axial compressor with a combustion system and single-stage turbine using principles proven in the Rolls-Royce Nene engine. The Avon design team was initially headed by Stanley Hooker assisted by Geoff Wilde until the development of the engine was moved from Barnoldswick to Derby in 1948 and Hooker subsequently left the company, moving to Bristol Engines. Design had started in 1945 and the first engine ran on March 25, 1947, with a 12-stage compressor. The engine was difficult to start, would not accelerate and broke first-stage blades. Two-position inlet guide vanes and compressor bleed were among the design changes which allowed the engine, as the RA.2, to run a 25-hour test and fly in the two <b>outboard</b> <b>positions</b> on the converted Avro Lancastrian military serial VM732, from Hucknall on August 15, 1948.|$|R
40|$|This project {{investigated}} the usability of Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren (LATCH) hardware by measuring LATCH implementations in 98 2011 or 2010 model-year vehicles. ISO and SAE LATCH usability rating systems {{were used to}} assess all vehicles using data from the second row left position. Child restraint/vehicle interaction was assessed using both ISO and NHTSA proposed procedures. Volunteer testing was performed with 36 subjects on 12 different vehicles using 3 different child restraints, with each subject performing 8 child restraint installations. The results from the vehicle survey indicate that most vehicle manufacturers provide LATCH hardware at only the minimum number of locations required by FMVSS 225. Only 7 vehicles had three sets of LATCH hardware in the second row, while most of the remaining 91 vehicles were only equipped with LATCH in each <b>outboard</b> <b>position</b> and a tether anchor in the center position. In the 21 vehicles with a third row, four had no tether anchors and 11 had no lower anchors in the third row. The SAE child restraint fixture could not be installed in 27 vehicles, although head restraint interference was the cause of interference in only one vehicle. Fifty-nine vehicles met the SAE recommended lower attachment force of 75 N (16. 9 lb) or less, while 15 vehicles required forces from 2 to 8 times this value. Only 2 vehicles met SAE recommendations for clearance angle of at least 75 degrees around the lower anchors.

40|$|Because Archean {{basement}} {{rocks are}} sparsely distributed around the Tarim Basin, {{little is known}} {{of the relationship between}} the Tarim Craton and the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic Columbia supercontinent. Zircon U-Pb dating of a Paleoproterozoic gneissic granite in the northern Tarim Craton yielded a crystallization age of 1915 Â± 13 Ma, consistent with global Paleoproterozoic collisional events (ca. 2. 1 - 1. 8 Ga) recorded in most cratons. Despite the fact that some zircons display discordant U-Pb ages with a distinct loss of radiogenetic Pb, all grains have similar 176 Lu/ 177 Hf and 176 Hf/ 177 Hf(t) values. Zircons from this granite have high Th/U ratios (0. 15 - 0. 95), but contrasting rare earth element (REE) patterns. The REE patterns show that the incorporation of most REE elements correlates with increasing age discordance. The discordant zircons, unlike typical magmatic zircons, were probably formed in an open system with the participation of aqueous fluids or hydrous melts during late- to post-magmatic recrystallization. Rocks of this granite pluton have high contents of SiO 2 (75. 45 - 78. 49 wt. %) and total alkali (6. 38 - 9. 00 wt. %), and moderate Al 2 O 3 (10. 31 - 13. 80 wt. %), showing peraluminous characteristics. Their high contents of high field strength elements (HFSE) and significant negative Eu anomalies are consistent with the geochemical characteristics of A-type granites. The low e{open} Hf(t) values of the granite suggest a derivation through anatexis of late Neoarchean tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) rocks of the basement, indicating that the geochemical characteristics of A-type granites may originate from partial melting of Archean TTGs. In combination with previously published age data, the regional anatexis provides evidence of a late Paleoproterozoic orogenic event on the northern margin of the Tarim Craton. Because the Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in the northern Tarim Craton show characteristics of sediments deposited on a passive continental margin, the craton is suggested to have occupy an <b>outboard</b> <b>position</b> in the Columbia supercontinent.

40|$|A {{major change}} in {{sedimentary}} and structural style occurs in Eocene strata exposed along the southern margin of the Oregon Coast Range. Lithofacies of the early Tertiary Umpqua Group have been described, mapped and assigned to likely depositional environments. Submarine fan and slope facies (upper Roseburg Formation) overlie Paleocene basaltic basement rocks to the north, whereas fluvial, deltaic and shallow marine facies (Lookingglass Formation) overlie Franciscan-equivalent strata to the south along the flank of the Klamath Mountains. These two depositional systems are gradational into one another, and were prograding northwestward until about 52 Ma. Means of clast compositions from sandstones and conglomerates from both the Roseburg and Lookingglass Formations suggest derivation from identical recycled orogen or arc-continent collision sources in the Klamath Mountains. Change from Klamath-parallel to more north-south structural trends is well displayed within early Eocene strata of the Umpqua Group. Five major fault systems involve lower Umpqua (Roseburg and Lookingglass) strata, and were active while deposition was taking place. All these faults ceased to be active at about 52 - 50 Ma, and are overlapped by the middle Eocene Tyee Formation. Regional strain analysis indicates more than 20 percent shortening by right-lateral convergence during early Eocene time. The structural style and syn-tectonic deformation of marine slope facies suggest deposition in an active subduction complex until about 52 Ma. Structural trends in the southern Oregon Coast Range parallel those in the adjacent Klamath Mountains {{until the end of}} the early Eocene. At 52 - 50 Ma, subduction apparently ceased as incoming seamounts clogged the trench, and may have jumped to an <b>outboard</b> <b>position</b> near the present day coastline. In middle Eocene time, the newly developed forearc region rapidly filled with sediments from a much sandier depositional system. Paleomagnetic studies of relatively undeformed Tyee forearc strata indicate as much clockwise rotation as the much more deformed, underlying volcanic basement of the Oregon Coast Range. Rotation of the Oregon Coast Range as a single crustal block must have occurred after, rather than during seamount accretion to the continental margin, which was essentially complete by 52 Ma...|$|E

40|$|Metasediments in {{the three}} early Palaeozoic Ross orogenic terranes in {{northern}} Victoria Land and Oates Land (Antarctica) are geochemically classified as immature litharenites to wackes and moderately mature shales. Highly mature lithotypes with Chemical Index of Weathering values of >= 95 are typically absent. Geochemical and Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotope {{results indicate that the}} turbiditic metasediments of the Cambro-Ordovician Robertson Bay Group in the eastern Robertson Bay Terrane represent a very homogeneous series lacking significant compositional variations. Major variations are only found in chemical parameters which reflect differences in degree of chemical weathering of their protoliths and in mechanical sorting of the detritus. Geochemical data, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr t= 490 Ma ratios of 0. 7120 - 0. 7174, epsilonNd, t= 490 Ma values of - 7. 6 to - 10. 3 and single-stage Nd-model ages of 1. 7 - 1. 9 Ga are indicative of an origin from a chemically evolved crustal source of on average late Palaeoproterozoic formation age. There is no evidence for significant sedimentary infill from primitive "ophiolitic" sources. Metasediments of the Middle Cambrian Molar Formation (Bowers Terrane) are compositionally strongly heterogeneous. Their major and trace element data and Sm-Nd isotope data (epsilonNd, t= 500 Ma values of - 14. 3 to - 1. 2 and single-stage Nd-model ages of 1. 7 - 2. 1 Ga) can be explained by mixing of sedimentary input from an evolved crustal source of at least early Palaeoproterozoic formation age and from a primitive basaltic source. The chemical heterogeneity of metasediments from the Wilson Terrane is largely inherited from compositional variations of their precursor rocks as indicated by the Ni vs TiO 2 diagram. Single-stage Nd-model ages of 1. 6 - 2. 2 Ga for samples from more western inboard areas of the Wilson Terrane (epsilonNd, t= 510 Ma - 7. 0 to - 14. 3) indicate a relatively high proportion of material derived from a crustal source with on average early Palaeoproterozoic formation age. Metasedimentary series in an eastern, more <b>outboard</b> <b>position</b> (epsilonNd, t= 510 Ma - 5. 4 to - 10. 0; single-stage Nd model ages 1. 4 - 1. 9) on the contrary document stronger influence of a more primitive source with younger formation ages. The chemical and isotopic characteristics of metasediments from the Bowers and Wilson terranes can be explained by variable contributions from two contrasting sources: a cratonic continental crust similar to the Antarctic Shield exposed in Georg V Land and Terre AdÃ©lie some hundred kilometers west of the study area and a primitive basaltic source probably represented by the Cambrian island-arc of the Bowers Terrane. While the data for metasediments of the Robertson Bay Terrane are also compatible with an origin from an Antarctic-Shield-type source, there is no direct evidence from their geochemistry or isotope geochemistry for an island-arc component in these series...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{computational}} {{methods are}} {{getting more and more}} sophisticated every day, enabling more accurate aircraft load predictions. In the structural design of aircraft higher levels of flexibility can be tolerated to arrive at a substantial weight reduction. The result is that aircraft of the future can be bigger, have better performance and less mass. The performance of an aircraft can be even further enhanced by the use of winglets or other wing tip devices. A more flexible structure in combination with larger dimensions can lead to substantial structural deflections. Due to these larger deflections, the interaction between the aerodynamics and structural mechanics is of increasing importance. Due to their <b>outboard</b> <b>position,</b> the aerodynamic performance of wing tip devices is obviously significantly influenced by the deformation of the flexible wing. Off course, a safe and reliable operational life of the aircraft has to be guaranteed and proven with adequate design calculations. The goal of this thesis was to develop an algorithm to enable the identification of flexibility effects on the outer wing within a manoeuvre loads context based on the Maximum Likelihood Method. The main difference with approaches of existing publications is that the models considered here are based on distributed local data rather than on the net effect on aircraft performance. While this requires the size of the specific models to be much larger, the identified models allow a much more detailed physical interpretation of the observed performance benefits or penalties of winglets or wing tip devices. There are many references that address the topic of aerodynamic performance of wing tip devices and also of winglets in particular. These studies are all based on either wind tunnel measurements or pure aerodynamic (CFD) analysis, thus valid for rigid aircraft. These studies are very important in understanding the complicated flow condition at the wing tip in order to arrive quicker at even more efficient designs. However, flight test measurements have shown that flexibility of the airframe has {{to be taken into account}} when predicting the (aerodynamic) loads on the winglet. An algorithm was developed that is able to identify the parameters in a nonlinear coupled aero-elastic manoeuvre loads model. The algorithm is based on the Maximum Likelihood method which is capable of solving even rank-deficient problems. This identification procedure is applied for a loads relevant industrial case using real flight test data. The identification procedure is performed five times using these in-flight measurements with modifications in the aerodynamic modelling on the wings and winglets. One model was developed that describes the nonlinear rigid behavior and could be optimised in an identification for a best fit to the flight test measurements. It was found that especially the local alpha-gradients on the winglet are much larger in this model as predicted by the corresponding results derived from the original aerodynamic database. These identified gradients were compared with the gradients determined from the CFD-simulations and it was shown that they correspond very well. The success of the identification of a specific model strongly depends on the structure of the model and the assumed initial values. The model must be sophisticated enough to capture/describe the phenomena contained in the measurements, however simple/small enough to enable its identification with the available computational resources. The identification algorithm from this thesis was shown to be a very good means to quantify model improvements during model development. Secondly, it can obviously be used to identify the most optimal values for the free model parameters. Control and SimulationAerospace Engineerin...|$|E

Continuing the tradition of minimal changes, the models received a new [...] "suspended" [...] accelerator pedal and cable throttle linkage. Additional safety equipment for the 1969 models included front shoulder belts and headrests for both front <b>outboard</b> seating <b>positions</b> and the front parking lights stayed on with the headlights. On the exterior, the center horizontal chrome grille bar was deleted.|$|R
50|$|The TST-14J is a Desert Aerospace, LLC {{modification}} of the TST-14 motorglider {{with the addition of}} a retractable jet engine used for self launching. It has a high T-tail. It is a mid wing design with straight tapered wings. The wing tips carry winglets and there are <b>outboard</b> ailerons, two <b>position</b> flaps and upper surface spoilers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Rollover crashes {{involving}} 997 automobile {{occupants of}} the front <b>outboard</b> seating <b>positions</b> were reviewed. Injury levels, using the Abbreviated Injury Scale, were studied for their association with ejection, restraint use, roof crush, car weight, and the absence or. presence of the B-pillar. The results indicate that he more serious injuries and fatalities are sustained by those jected from the car, with ejection occurring most often through the side glass area. Restraints are related to less severe injuries to the non-ejected occupant {{as well as to}} a reduced rate of ejection. Roof crush is found to be a factor that interacts with restraint use and with the vehicle factors...|$|R
50|$|The Catalina was {{modified}} by adding two 340 hp (254 kW) Lycoming GSO-480-B2D6 engines <b>positioned</b> <b>outboard</b> {{of the original}} Pratt & Whitney radials to increase range and performance. (These engines and cowlings had originally been installed on the McKinnon four engine Grumman Goose. When they were removed by McKinnon to convert the Goose to twin turboprop power, they were purchased by Dr. Bird for his PBY Innovator conversion. Engineering for the Innovator conversion was performed by Spectro engineering of Los Angeles).|$|R
50|$|TeST {{introduced}} the TST-13 single seat motor glider in 2005 as an all-composite replacement for their wood and composite TST-9. It {{has a similar}} layout, front engined and with a high T-tail. The TST-13 shares a similar rear fuselage and tail design and identical wing spars with the all-composite TST-10 single seat sailplane. It is a mid wing design with straight tapered wings which, unlike those of the TST-10, are swept forward 5Â° at 25% chord. The wing tips carry winglets and there are <b>outboard</b> ailerons, two <b>position</b> flaps and upper surface spoilers.|$|R
5000|$|Until the 1980s, three-point belts were {{commonly}} {{available only}} in the front outboard seats of cars; the back seats were only often fitted with lap belts. Evidence of the potential of lap belts to cause separation of the lumbar vertebrae and the sometimes associated paralysis, or [...] "seat belt syndrome", led to progressive revision of passenger safety regulations in nearly all developed countries to require 3-point belts first in all <b>outboard</b> seating <b>positions</b> and eventually in all seating positions in passenger vehicles. Since September 1, 2007, all new cars sold in the U.S. require a lap and shoulder belt in the center rear seat. Besides regulatory changes, [...] "seat belt syndrome" [...] has led to tremendous liability for vehicle manufacturers. One Los Angeles case resulted in a $45 million jury verdict against the Ford Motor Company; the resulting $30 million judgment (after deductions for another defendant who settled prior to trial) was affirmed on appeal in 2006.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe data {{contained}} {{here were}} obtained from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration×³s National Automotive Sampling System â€“ Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS) for the years 2008 â€“ 2014. This publically available data set monitors motor vehicle crashes in the United States, using a stratified random sample frame, resulting in information on approximately 5000 crashes each year that can be utilized to create national estimates for crashes. The NASS-CDS data sets document vehicle, crash, and occupant factors. These data can be utilized to examine public health, law enforcement, roadway planning, and vehicle design issues. The data provided in this brief are a subset of crash events and occupants. The crashes provided are exclusively frontal crashes. Within these crashes, only restrained occupants who were seated in the right front seat position or the second row <b>outboard</b> seat <b>positions</b> were included. The front row and second row data sets were utilized to construct occupant pairs crashes where both a right front seat occupant and a second row occupant were available. Both unpaired and paired data sets are provided in this brief...|$|R
40|$|Seat belt {{anchorage}} locations have {{a strong}} effect on occupant protection. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 210 specifies requirements for {{the layout of the}} anchorages relative to the seating reference point and seat back angle established by the SAE J 826 H-point manikin. Sled testing and computational simulation has established that belt anchorage locations {{have a strong}} effect on occupant kinematics, particularly for child occupants using the belt as their primary restraint. As part of a larger study of vehicle geometry, the locations of the anchorage points in the second-row, <b>outboard</b> seating <b>positions</b> of 83 passenger cars and light trucks with a median model year of 2005 were measured. The lower anchorage locations spanned the entire range of lap belt angles permissible under FMVSS 210 and the upper anchorages (D-ring locations) were distributed widely as well. Combined with the findings from concurrent research on the effects of belt geometry, these results suggest that occupant kinematics in frontal impact can be expected to differ widely across vehicles due to differences in belt geometry...|$|R
