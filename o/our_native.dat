5|$|Between the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, Mr. Prospector, Cup Bearer, Ecole Etage, Champagne Charlie, and Step Nicely, none of {{whom had}} run in the Derby, were all named as {{possible}} entrants. Three horses, Secretariat, Sham, and <b>Our</b> <b>Native,</b> all raced in the Kentucky Derby two weeks prior. On May 15, seven owners confirmed their intentions to enter their horses by paying a US$1,000 deposit. The horses officially registered that day were <b>Our</b> <b>Native,</b> Secretariat, and Sham, along with new runners Deadly Dream, Ecole Etage, The Lark Twist, and Torsion. A day later, Deadly Dream's trainer stated that he was unsure about racing his colt because he felt the horse could not match Secretariat, Sham, or <b>Our</b> <b>Native.</b> In addition, The Lark Twist's owner Larry Boyce scratched his horse from the race because he received word that <b>Our</b> <b>Native</b> registered, dropping {{the total number of}} horses competing to six. However, on the 17th, Boyce attempted to re-enter The Lark Twist, but was denied under the Rules of Racing of Maryland which stated that the scratching of a horse was irreversible. An Associated Press article commented that the credentials of Secretariat and Sham could lead to the running being one of the smallest since 1964.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat {{was widely}} viewed as the {{favorite}} to win by most sportswriters and people; however, the added distance {{and the possibility of}} running too slow for a distance or running too fast too soon could potentially cause him to lose. Out of the starting gate, Secretariat and Sham traded the lead. Around the three-quarters mile marker Sham began to fade and Secretariat began to extend an advantage. Twice a Prince and <b>Our</b> <b>Native</b> overtook Sham to take second and third, respectively. Sham finished last, behind Pvt. Smiles, who was in last before Sham slowed severely.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat's winning time of 1: {{and last}} quarter mile in 23 seconds were both {{records for the}} Derby. In addition, he had run each quarter-mile faster than before, with times of , 24, , , and 23 seconds. Sham {{maintained}} his stride and crossed the line in second place, eight lengths ahead of third-place finisher <b>Our</b> <b>Native,</b> who had lost ground on the final turn into the homestretch. Sham also broke the previous course record {{with a time of}} 1:. Shecky Greene, who led for most of the race, finished in sixth position.|$|E

"Presently I {{saw some}} of <b>our</b> <b>natives</b> marching homewards in a {{scattered}} and disorganised fashion, but evidently very proud of themselves, for they were waving their assegais and singing scraps of war-songs.

60|$|Now {{our state}} became desperate. We retreated across the central passage, fearing lest the blazing rafters should fall upon <b>our</b> <b>natives,</b> who were losing heart and {{would no longer}} stay beneath them. But the Quabies, more bold, clambered in through the south window, and {{attacked}} us {{in the doorway of}} the larger sitting-room.|$|R
5|$|Sham, {{who had won}} the Santa Anita Derby, {{was seen}} as the most {{formidable}} challenger to Secretariat in the Derby because of his finish ahead of Secretariat in the Wood and his Santa Anita victory. Coming off the heels of the his victory at the Wood, Angle Light was seen as a threat to win. Angle Light was also trained by Lucien Laurin, along with as Secretariat, and thus Secretariat and Angle Light were coupled for betting purposes. Flamingo Stakes winner <b>Our</b> <b>Native</b> finished first or second in seven of his nine starts during the 1973 season, causing him to be named as a contender. Blue Grass Stakes winner My Gallant and Shecky Greene, who won the Fountain of Youth Stakes, were both trained in Chicago by Lou Goldline, which also resulted in their odds being coupled. Goldline said the two horses were similar and would do well at Churchill Downs because they both liked fast tracks. Impecunious, who was victorious in the Arkansas Derby, was initially entered in the race, but withdrew two days before because of a bruised heel. None of the competing horses had been sired by a previous Derby winner.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{about life}} in Victorian Cambridge, Gwen Raverat (granddaughter of Charles Darwin) {{describes}} the 'sport' of Stinkhorn hunting: In <b>our</b> <b>native</b> woods there grows a kind of toadstool, called in the vernacular The Stinkhorn, though in Latin it bears a grosser name. The name is justified, for the fungus can be hunted by the scent alone; and this was Aunt Etty's great invention. Armed with a basket and a pointed stick, and wearing special hunting cloak and gloves, she would sniff her way round the wood, pausing here and there, her nostrils twitching, when she {{caught a whiff of}} her prey; then at last, with a deadly pounce, she would fall upon her victim, and poke his putrid carcass into her basket. At the end of the day's sport, the catch was brought back and burnt in the deepest secrecy on the drawing-room fire, with the door locked; because of the morals of the maids.|$|E

For we have all kinds of larks on hand. The wars and rumours of wars begin to take consistency, insomuch that we have landed the weapons this morning, and {{inspected}} the premises with a view to defence. Of course it will come to nothing; but as in all stories of massacres, the one you don't prepare for is the one that comes off. All <b>our</b> <b>natives</b> think ill of the business; none of the whites do. According to <b>our</b> <b>natives</b> the demonstration threatened for to-day or to-morrow is one of vengeance on the whites--small wonder--and if that begins--where will it stop?

500|$|The 1973 Kentucky Derby on May 5 {{attracted}} {{a crowd of}} 134,476 to Churchill Downs, then the largest crowd in North American racing history. The bettors made the entry of Secretariat and Angle Light the 3–2 favorite, with Sham the second choice at 5–2. The start was marred when Twice a Prince reared in his stall, hitting <b>Our</b> <b>Native,</b> positioned next to him, and causing Sham to bang {{his head against the}} gate, loosening two teeth. Sham then broke poorly and cut himself, also bumping into Navajo. Secretariat avoided problems by breaking last from post position 10, then cut over to the rail. Early leader Shecky Greene set a reasonable pace, then gave way to Sham around the far turn. Secretariat came charging as they entered the stretch and battled with Sham down the stretch, finally pulling away to win by [...] lengths. <b>Our</b> <b>Native</b> finished eight lengths further back in third.|$|E
500|$|The 1973 Kentucky Derby was the 99th {{running of}} the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. Secretariat won the Derby in a record time of 1:, [...] lengths ahead of Sham, while <b>Our</b> <b>Native</b> {{finished}} in third position. Of the thirteen horses that entered and started the race, all horses completed the event. The event was viewed in person by a then-record crowd of 134,476, while also being broadcast both on television and over the radio.|$|E

[...] Pincay stated that in future races, he planned to [...] "wait a little longer before making my move." [...] Donald Brumfield, Our Native's jockey said Twice a Prince kicked <b>Our</b> <b>Native</b> in the hoof and body while rearing in the starting gate.

500|$|Following his record-breaking {{victory at}} the Kentucky Derby, Secretariat was the favorite. In the days between the Derby and the Preakness, groom Eddie Sweat noted that it was strange not having any rumors {{circulating}} about Secretariat's health. Sham and Secretariat were ridden by the same jockeys as in the Derby, Laffit Pincay, Jr. and Ron Turcotte, respectively. Sham was believed {{to have the best}} chance of beating Secretariat. Aside from Sham and Secretariat, <b>Our</b> <b>Native</b> was selected by Joe Nichols, a writer for The New York Times, as an outside contender for victory. In pre-race interviews, Deadly Dream's trainer Buddy Delp believed he could challenge for third place as he had no [...] "illusions about beating Secretariat and Sham." ...|$|E

At the time, within White Pines Woods, the tallest trees stood [...] in height. The area was noted by Elia W. Peattie, a poet and member of the Eagle's Nest Art Colony (located at present-day Lowden State Park), who expressed the need for preservation of the White Pines Woods in one of her poems.|$|E
500|$|In {{the period}} {{leading up to}} the Preakness, Kentucky Derby winner Secretariat was pegged as the {{favorite}} to win the race. Aside from Secretariat, Sham was named as the only other horse that could win the race or even challenge Secretariat. Initially seven horses officially enrolled to race in the event, but the field reduced to six after an owner scratched his horse. The entrants in the Preakness featured three horses that did not compete in the Derby. At the start, Secretariat broke last, but then made a huge, last-to-first move on the first turn. After reaching the lead with [...] furlongs to go, he was never challenged, and won by [...] lengths, Sham finishing second and <b>Our</b> <b>Native</b> third. The victory led to the stallion being featured on several magazine covers. Secretariat would go on to win the Belmont Stakes in the succeeding weeks, becoming the ninth horse to complete the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing and the first in 25 years.|$|E
5000|$|Commenting on {{her second}} {{collection}} of poetry (Oasis, 1943), the Guatemalan critic Ramiro Córdoba writes: [...] "Inside her pages, we breathe in {{the scent of}} the wooded countryside but do not see the swarm of cantharides above, driving <b>our</b> <b>natives</b> into a spate of frenzied dancing." [...] For many years, she travelled through the countries of Central America promoting Nicaraguan culture. One of her conferences was devoted to the work of the Nicaraguan writer Joaquín Pasos (1914-1947), at another she presented the anti-fascist Spanish poet León Felipe (1884-1968).|$|R

500|$|Out of the {{starting}} gate, Ecole Etage took the lead, ahead of Torsion, while race favorite Secretariat exited last. Sham and Deadly Dream made contact exiting the gate. While Sham {{was able to}} successfully gain stride, Deadly Dream began to run towards the railing and collided with it when entering the first turn. Going into the course's first turn, Secretariat passed two horses {{on the outside and}} passed the remainder as the horses entered the backstretch. Sham was the only horse that was able to stay with Secretariat's acceleration. Secretariat held the lead {{for the remainder of the}} race and crossed the finish line in first position, [...] lengths ahead of Sham. <b>Our</b> <b>Native</b> placed third, eight lengths behind Sham. This was the first time in the history of the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes that the top three horses in the Derby finished in the same positions at the Preakness.|$|E
500|$|In the 1973 Preakness Stakes on May 19, Secretariat broke last, {{but then}} made a huge, last-to-first move on the first turn. Raymond Woolfe, a {{photographer}} for the Daily Racing Form, captured Secretariat launching the move with a leaping stride in the air. This was later {{used as the basis}} for the statue by John Skeaping that stands in the Belmont Park paddock. Turcotte later said that he was proudest of this win because of the split-second decision he made going into the turn: [...] "I let my horse drop back, when I went to drop in, they started backing up into me. I said, 'I don't want to get trapped here.' So I just breezed by them." [...] Secretariat completed the second quarter mile of the race in under 22 seconds. After reaching the lead with [...] furlongs to go, Secretariat was never challenged, and won by [...] lengths, with Sham again finishing second and <b>Our</b> <b>Native</b> in third, a further eight lengths back. It was the first time in history that the top three finishers in the Derby and Preakness were the same; the distance between each of the horses was also the same.|$|E
500|$|Twice a Prince {{reared in}} the {{starting}} gate, which delayed the start. Out of the starting gate, Shecky Greene set the pace for the field, while race favorite Secretariat started in last place. Exiting the gate, Sham hit his mouth against the gate and subsequently bumped into Navajo before gaining proper stride. Sham briefly took the lead around the quarter-mile marker, but Shecky Greene quickly retook the lead. Beginning the first turn, Secretariat had moved ahead of only two horses; however, in the next quarter-mile Secretariat moved into sixth position. A half-mile in, Shecky Greene maintained a three length lead over Gold Bag, but his pace had slowed compared to the first quarter. Sham remained close {{to the front of}} the field within the top four for the first half of the race; he moved into second position as the field reached the half-mile post. At the three-quarters post, at the start of the homestretch, Shecky Greene began to fade and Sham overtook him to move into first going into the final furlong. Secretariat, who had passed his competitors on the outside throughout the race, overtook Sham in the final furlong and pulled ahead, finishing [...] horse lengths in front of Sham. <b>Our</b> <b>Native</b> took third and Forego, who went on to win multiple Eclipse Awards as an older horse, was fourth.|$|E
