40|$|Given the {{significant}} initial investment and long {{life span of}} road-stream crossing structures, interest has grown in developing tools to evaluate their physical and biological effectiveness. In this case, the physical effectiveness monitoring guidelines being developed consist of two protocols; Level 2 is a detailed, statistically-based survey and evaluation of a suite of physical habitat metrics, while Level 1 is a simplified subset of that. Our premise for both monitoring protocols {{is that if the}} design channel characteristics through the crossing are similar to a nearby representative reach of the natural channel, then the design channel is considered to be effectively providing geomorphic, hydrologic, and ecological continuity that ultimately benefit fish and other aquatic organism passage. The first step for level 2 monitoring is selecting a representative reach in the natural channel that is most similar in gradient, length, and channel type as the design channel through the crossing using a surveyed longitudinal profile. A suite of channel metrics are then measured and statistically evaluated {{along the length of the}} representative reach, design channel, inlet transition, and <b>outlet</b> <b>transition.</b> Channel metrics measured and analyzed include 1) channel width at bankfull flow, half of bankfull flow, and low flow; 2) bank margin irregularity at bankfull flow, half of bankfull flow, and low flow, 3) maximum residual flow depth, 4) lateral bed variability, and 5) bed-material particle-size distributions and different percentile particle sizes. We use the multiple response permutation procedure and non-parametric derived confidence intervals for the various channel metrics in the design channel, inlet transition, and <b>outlet</b> <b>transition</b> to determine if they are similar or different than those in the representative channel. These results from the different channel metrics are weighted and integrated in a summary rubric to develop an overall score for physical effectiveness. Because of the time needed to collect, analyze, and interpret the data from level 2 physical monitoring, it is intended to be applied only at a subset of sites to gain a better and more complete understanding of road-stream crossing channel design methods and overall physical effectiveness...|$|E

The level 1 physical monitoring protocol was purposefully designed to be simple and quick, so that users could semi-quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of road-stream crossing channel designs at a large number of sites. Relatively few measurements are required, but they provide a consistent framework for evaluating, documenting, and reporting {{the degree to which the}} road-stream crossing design channel, including the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>transitions,</b> match the physical characteristics of the adjacent natural channel. Physical channel characteristics of interest include bank full and wetted widths, maximum depths, bed-materials sizes, and stream bank irregularity and continuity. Median values for each physical measurement are compared with the range observed in the adjacent natural channel. The results of the individual metrics are weighted and integrated in a summary rubric to develop an overall rating for physical effectiveness. The Level 1 protocol is intended to provide a quick assessment of effectiveness for a large number of sites, which means that limited information is available to critique the site’s design and construction, compared to the Level 2 protocol...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{an engine}} {{transient}} condition, effects of different exhaust mass flows, inlet signal amplitudes and periods on dynamic {{responses of the}} three-way catalytic converter were investigated experimentally. Experimental results show that exhaust mass flows, inlet signal amplitudes and periods have important influence on engine emissions and oxygen storage capacity of Ceria for the three-way catalytic converter with CeO 2 catalyst in the washcoat. With the increase of the exhaust mass flow, the lambda outlet signal increases nonlinearly; emissions are better {{at the beginning and}} then turns deteriorated {{in the case of a}} high mass flow after the lean-rich <b>transition.</b> <b>Outlet</b> lambda increases almost linearly with the increase of exhaust mass flows and lambda outlet signal amplitudes after the richlean transition...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{orientation}} of macro-sized fibres in turbulent flows is studied, {{as well as the}} effect of nano-sized fibrils on hydrodynamic stability. The focus lies on enabling processes for new materials where cellulose is the main constituent. When fibres (or any elongated particles) are added to a fluid, the complexity of the flow-problem increases. The fluid flow will influence the rotation of the fibres, and therefore also effect the overall fibre orientation. Exactly how the fibres rotate depends to a large extent on the mean velocity gradient in the flow. In addition, when fibres are added to a suspending fluid, the total stress in the suspension will increase, resulting in an increased apparent viscosity. The increase in stress is related to the direction of deformation in relation to {{the orientation of}} the particle, i. e. whether the deformation happens along the long or short axis of the fibre. The increase in stress, which in most cases is not constant neither in time nor space, will in turn influence the flow. This thesis starts off with the orientation and spatial distribution of fibres in the turbulent flow down an inclined plate. By varying fibre and flow parameters it is discovered that the main parameter controlling the orientation distribution is the aspect ratio of the fibres, with only minor influences from the other parameters. Moreover, the fibres are found to agglomerate into streamwise streaks. A new method to quantify this agglomeration is developed, taking care of the problems that arise due to the low concentration in the experiments. It is found that streakiness, i. e. the tendency to agglomerate in streaks, varies with Reynolds number. Going from fibre orientation to flow dynamics of fibre suspensions, the influence of cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) on laminar/turbulent transition is investigated in three different setups, namely plane channel flow, curved-rotating channel flow, and the flow in a flow focusing device. This last flow case is selected since it is can be used for assembly of CNF based materials. In the plane channel flow, the addition of CNF delays the transition more than predicted from measured viscosities while in the curved-rotating channel the opposite effect is discovered. This is qualitatively confirmed by linear stability analyses. Moreover, a transient growth analysis in the plane channel reveals an increase in streamwise wavenumber with increasing concentration of CNF. In the flow focusing device, i. e. at the intersection of three inlets and one <b>outlet,</b> the <b>transition</b> is found to mainly depend on the Reynolds number of the side flow. Recirculation zones forming downstream of two sharp corners are hypothesised to be the cause of the transition. With that in mind, the two corners are given a larger radius in an attempt to stabilise the flow. However, if anything, the flow seems to become unstable at a smaller Reynolds number, indicating that the separation bubble is not the sole cause of the transition. The choice of fluid in the core flow is found to have no effect on the stability, neither when using fluids with different viscosities nor when a non-Newtonian CNF dispersion was used. Thus, Newtonian model fluids can be used when studying the flow dynamics in this type of device. As a proof of concept, a flow focusing device is used to produce a continuous film from CNF. The fibrils are believed to be aligned due to the extensional flow created in the setup, resulting in a transparent film, with an estimated thickness of 1 um. QC 20141003 </p...|$|R
