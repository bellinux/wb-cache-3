5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection {{of some of the}} Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>to</b> the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>to</b> state and local governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E
5|$|Black's most {{prominent}} ideological opponent on the Warren Court was John Marshall Harlan II, who replaced Justice Jackson in 1955.

5|$|In 1925, the Taft Court {{laid the}} groundwork for the {{incorporation}} of many of the guarantees of the Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>to</b> be applied against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. In Gitlow v. New York, the court by a 6–2 vote with Taft in the majority, upheld Gitlow's conviction on criminal anarchy charges for advocating the overthrow of the government; his defense was freedom of speech. Justice Edward T. Sanford wrote the court's opinion, and both majority and minority (Holmes, joined by Brandeis) assumed that the First Amendment's Free Speech and Free Press clauses were protected against infringement by the states.|$|E

5|$|The Federalist Papers (specifically Federalist No. 84) are {{notable for}} their {{opposition}} to what later became the United States Bill of Rights. The idea of adding a Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>to</b> the Constitution was originally controversial because the Constitution, as written, did not specifically enumerate or {{protect the rights of}} the people, rather it listed the powers of the government and left all that remained to the states and the people. Alexander Hamilton, the author of Federalist No. 84, feared that such an enumeration, once written down explicitly, would later be interpreted as a list of the only rights that people had.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment {{guarantees}} {{the rights of}} freedom of speech and peaceable assembly, among others. While not explicitly mentioned, the Supreme Court has held that the right to assembly includes the freedom of association, particularly political association. These protections not only prohibit the government from passing laws which infringe upon these rights, but also from taking actions which would violate them. While the Bill of Rights—which includes the First Amendment—applied originally only to the federal government, the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed for the application of the Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>to</b> the states under the incorporation doctrine.|$|E
5|$|The Senate edited these {{amendments}} still further, making 26 {{changes of}} its own. Madison's proposal to apply {{parts of the}} Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>to</b> the {{states as well as}} the federal government was eliminated, and the seventeen amendments were condensed to twelve, which were approved on September 9, 1789. The Senate also eliminated the last of Madison's proposed changes to the preamble.|$|E

40|$|Institute <b>of</b> <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> Build in Czech and German Law The thesis {{deals with}} {{the topic of the}} {{institute}} <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> build in Czech and German law. The elementary aim of the thesis is to describe the legal institute <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> build, not only in the Czech legal system, but also in the German legal system. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> build is an absolute property right with effect erga omnes. It belongs into a group <b>of</b> <b>rights,</b> which privileges one to use a thing of someone else. The statute declares the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> build to be real property. On the ground <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> build arises the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the builder <b>to</b> have a building on the surface or under the surface of the encumbered piece <b>of</b> land. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> build is always limited through a set period of time, it should not be created for longer than 99 years. The typical features <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> build are alienability and inheritability. The content of this thesis is divided into four chapters. The nature <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> build, as a right, which privileges one to use the thing of someone else, is described in the first chapter. There are also descriptions of the basic legal terms associated with the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> build. The chapter describes the terms 'building' and 'builder' as well as the principle of superficies solo cedit. The second chapter is dedicated to the history of [...] ...|$|R
5|$|Infuriated by {{what was}} {{perceived}} as yet another affront to British prestige after the recent landings at Pontian and Labis by Indonesian volunteers in southwestern Malaysia, members of the British Cabinet, particularly Peter Thorneycroft and Louis Mountbatten, favoured sending the carrier back through the Strait in spite of the Indonesian ban. Though British naval commanders in the Far East had grave concerns that the Victorious would be indefensible while in passage, the prevailing opinion was that not to send the ship would result in an immense political defeat on both a domestic and international scale as well as the loss <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> an important waterway. Tension mounted as the British and Indonesians each refused to bend, and as the carrier's time to sail came, war became increasingly likely.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November, Riel invited Anglophones {{to attend}} a {{convention}} alongside Métis representatives to discuss a course of action, and on 1 December he proposed to this convention a list <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> be demanded {{as a condition of}} union. Much of the settlement came to accept the Métis point of view, but a passionately pro-Canadian minority began organizing in opposition. Loosely constituted as the Canadian Party, this group was led by John Christian Schultz, Charles Mair, Colonel John Stoughton Dennis, and a more reticent Major Charles Boulton. McDougall attempted to assert his authority by authorizing Dennis to raise a contingent of armed men, but the Anglophone settlers largely ignored this call to arms. Schultz, however, attracted approximately fifty recruits and fortified his house and store. Riel ordered Schultz's home surrounded, and the outnumbered Canadians soon surrendered and were imprisoned in Upper Fort Garry.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{completion}} of the reconquista, the defeated Muslims were generally given freedom of religion as terms of their surrender. For example, the Treaty of Granada, which governed the surrender of the emirate, guaranteed a set <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> the conquered Muslims, including religious tolerance and fair treatment, in return for their capitulation. The increasing occurrences of forced conversion triggered a series of Muslim rebellions in Granada (1499–1501). The rebellions were suppressed, and afterwards the Muslims in Granada were no longer given the rights that had been provided to them by the Treaty of Granada. They were given the choice to remain and accept baptism, to reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or to be exiled. The option of exile was often not feasible in practice because of the difficulty in uprooting one's family and making the journey to Muslim lands in North Africa, the inability to pay the fee required by the authorities for safe passage, and the general tendency by the authorities to discourage and hinder such an exodus.|$|E
