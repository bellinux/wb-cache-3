50|$|More recently, {{the debate}} has been reopened by Jeffrey Schaffer, who {{suggests}} {{that the role of}} glaciers and other erosion processes has been dramatically overstated.

Methods: This article describes trends in adolescent???s (aged 11, 13 and 15 years) perception {{of communication with}} mothers and fathers by gender across 32 European and North American countries from 2002 to 2010. Analyses were performed on 425 699 records employing a General Linear Model (MANOVA). Results: In most countries, significant increases in the prevalence of ease of communication with both mothers and fathers were observed, with the greatest positive changes over time in Estonia, Denmark and Wales. In some countries, the opposite trend was found with the greatest negative changes occurring in France, Slovenia and Poland. Across the pooled dataset, a significant positive trend was observed for ease of communication with father, for both boys and girls and for ease of communication with mother for boys only. Conclusion: The temporal trends demonstrated an increase in a positive health asset for many young people, that of family communication.

The specialization of life sciences <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> decade, <b>coupled</b> with an increasing number of biomedical datasets available through standardized interfaces, has created opportunities towards new methods in biomedical discovery. Despite the popularity of semantic web technologies in tackling the integrative bioinformatics challenge, there are many obstacles towards its usage by non-technical research audiences. In particular, the ability to fully exploit integrated information needs using improved interactive methods intuitive to the biomedical experts. In this report we present ReVeaLD (a Real-time Visual Explorer and Aggregator of Linked Data), a user-centered visual analytics platform devised to increase intuitive interaction with data from distributed sources. ReVeaLD facilitates query formulation using a domain-specific language (DSL) identified by biomedical experts and mapped to a self-updated catalogue of elements from external sources. ReVeaLD was implemented in a cancer research setting; queries included retrieving data from in silico experiments, protein modeling and gene expression. ReVeaLD was developed using Scalable Vector Graphics and JavaScript and a demo with explanatory video is available at [URL] A set of user-defined graphic rules controls the display of information through media-rich user interfaces. Evaluation of ReVeaLD was carried out as a game: biomedical researchers were asked to assemble a set of 5 challenge questions and time and interactions with the platform were recorded. Preliminary results indicate that complex queries could be formulated under less than two minutes by unskilled researchers. The results also indicate that supporting the identification of the elements of a DSL significantly increased intuitiveness of the platform and usability of semantic web technologies by domain users...|$|R

Multivariable Poisson regression was used to examine temporal changes and seasonal variation in incidence rate and Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate 28 -day and 1 -year mortality.

The overall age- and gender-adjusted incidence rate of Enterobacter spp. BSI was 3. 3 per 100 000 person-years (95 % CI 2. 3 – 4. 4).

Two approaches can be discerned in {{the combination of}} LC and FT-IR. The first and simpler approach {{is to use a}} flow cell through which the effluent from the LC column is passed while the IR spectra are continuously recorded. The second approach involves elimination of the LC solvent prior to IR detection using an interface which evaporates the eluent and deposits the analytes onto a substrate. This paper provides a general overview of flow-cell based IR detection and briefly discusses early solvent-elimination interfaces for LC-FT-IR. A more comprehensive description is given of interface systems which use spraying to induce rapid eluent evaporation, and which basically represent the state-of-the-art in LC-FT-IR. Finally, the interface systems suitable for reversed-phase LC are summarized and the perspectives of LC-FT-IR are discussed. The overview indicates that flow-cell LC-FT-IR has rather poor detection limits but can be useful for the specific and quantitative detection of major constituents of mixtures. Solvent-elimination techniques, on the other hand, provide much better sensitivity and enhanced spectral quality which is essential when unambiguous identification of low-level constituents is required.
