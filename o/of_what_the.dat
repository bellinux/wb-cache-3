5|$|In a {{retrospective}} Virtual Console review, IGN's Lucas M. Thomas commended the gameplay depth and the detailed visual presentation. He acknowledged the difficulty, even on easy, but praised {{the game as}} one of the best examples of the niche shooting gallery genre. Mat Allen of Nintendo Life found the game to be an excellent example <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Virtual Console is for: providing gamers chances to experience quality games that were overlooked in their time. He highlighted the release as providing a cheap option to play a game which has become an expensive collector's item.|$|E

At the time of his appearance, he has been living in the village for 70 years. During World War II, he had led an Ahnenerbe expedition to find the entrance of Shambhala. However, afraid <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Nazis would do with the power found in the Cintamani Stone, Schäfer shot and killed all {{of the members of the}} expedition but himself.|$|E
5|$|Meshuggah's {{music is}} written by Thordendal, Hagström and Haake with {{assistance}} from Kidman and Lövgren. During songwriting, a member programs the drums, and records the guitar and bass via computer. He presents his idea {{to the other}} members as a finished work. Meshuggah typically adheres to the original idea and rarely changes the song afterwards. Hagström explains that each member has an idea <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> others are doing conceptually, and nobody thinks exclusively {{in terms of a}} particular instrument. Kidman does not play guitar in the band anymore, but he is involved in writing riffs.|$|E

5|$|Several {{countries}} employ {{government agencies}} to provide forecasts and watches/warnings/advisories {{to the public}} in order to protect life and property and maintain commercial interests. Knowledge <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> end user needs from a weather forecast {{must be taken into account}} to present the information in a useful and understandable way. Examples include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service (NWS) and Environment Canada's Meteorological Service (MSC). Traditionally, newspaper, television, and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting weather forecast information to the public. Increasingly, the internet is being used due to the vast amount of specific information that can be found. In all cases, these outlets update their forecasts on a regular basis.|$|E
5|$|Soviet air assaults {{against civilians}} in Estonian towns {{were a part}} of the offensive, aimed at forcing the Estonians away from {{supporting}} the German side. The Soviet Long Range Aviation branch assaulted the Estonian capital of Tallinn on the night of 8–9 March. Approximately 40% of the housing was destroyed in the city; 25,000 people were left homeless and 500 civilians were killed. The result of the air raid was the opposite <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Soviets intended, as people felt disgusted by the Soviet atrocities; more men answered the German conscription call.|$|E

SuperLuchas magazine later described the Universal Tournament as a promising sign <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> CMLL/TNA working relationship would bring, but in hindsight also noted that it turned out that those promises were never fulfilled as the two companies stopped working together by the end of 2008.|$|E

5|$|The story survives {{through the}} Hundred Rolls, the great {{survey of the}} English {{hundreds}} made by Edward I, in 1274-5, on returning to his new kingdom from crusade. The scheme, impractical as it might seem, was supposedly based on contemporary sagas of Viking heroes. But the complaints of the local community {{were based on the}} fact that Southchurch had taken all the supplies home to his own manor of Southchurch, received 200 marks from the exchequer, yet never paid out any <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> owners of the goods were entitled to.|$|E

5|$|Though Fox was {{initially}} worried about an entire episode {{set in the}} other universe, they soon came to appreciate the storyline. The episode included the first appearances of guest actors Andre Royo and Amy Madigan, who would both appear in several later episodes. It first aired in the United States on Fox in September 23, 2010, receiving almost all positive reviews due to the combination of emotional storylines, suspense, action, and humor. Many {{thought it was a}} good indicator <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> rest of the season had to offer, while others appreciated the numerous popular culture references that set the two universes apart.|$|E

5|$|Tributary {{missions}} from vassal {{states were}} commonly allowed to include traders, who thus gained opportunities {{to do business}} in the capital markets. No doubt a large proportion <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Chinese court chose to call tributary missions were in fact shrewdly organized commercial ventures by foreign merchants with no diplomatic status at all. This was unquestionably the case, most notably, with a group of traders who appeared on the south coast in 166 AD claiming to be envoys from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.|$|E
5|$|Because {{little was}} known about the region, the {{elements}} of its climate, citrus, water, and general ideas about illness and health, Stowe was possibly first among several authors and advertising schemes that portrayed Florida as an exotic place of natural wonders and powers that could rejuvenate frail health. What travel writers published on Florida were exaggerated claims, readily accepted by audiences hungry for escapist literature. Biographer Forrest Wilson considers the finished product, Palmetto Leaves—published in 1873—to be the first promotional writing about Florida ever. Occasionally letters about the state were printed in local newspapers in the North, but because Florida was {{still very much a}} rugged wilderness, Northerners really had no concept <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> region was like. Rather besotted with the marvelous properties she saw in the orange, Stowe intended to call the book Orange Blossoms, but changed the title to better express the plant that proliferated the region the most.|$|E
5|$|Descriptions {{from early}} explorers and {{settlers}} give some idea <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Pine Creek Gorge was like {{before it was}} clearcut. The forest was up to 85percent hemlock and white pine, with the rest hardwoods. Many animal species that are now vanished inhabited the area. A herd of 12,000American bison migrated along the West Branch Susquehanna River in 1773. Pine Creek was home to large predators such as wolves, lynx, wolverines, panthers, fishers, foxes and bobcats, all save the last three now locally extinct. The area had herds of elk and deer, and large numbers of black bears, river otters, and beavers. In 1794, two of the earliest white explorers to travel up Pine Creek found so many rattlesnakes on its banks {{that they had to}} sleep in their canoe. Further upstream, insects forced them to do the same.|$|E
