5|$|Acarya Ananda Jha, {{the author}} of the Chinnamasta Tattva, prescribes her worship by {{soldiers}} as she embodies self-control of lust, heroic self-sacrifice for the benefit of others, and fearlessness in the face of death. In a collective prayer to the Mahavidyas in the Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana, the devotee prays to emulate Chhinnamasta in her generosity to others. Other goals common to worship of all Mahavidyas are: poetic speech, well-being, control of one's foes, removal <b>of</b> <b>obstacles,</b> ability to sway kings, ability to attract others, conquest over other kings, and, finally, moksha (salvation).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the use <b>of</b> <b>Obstacle</b> Analysis to identify anomaly-handling requirements for a safetycritical, autonomous system. The software {{requirements for the}} system evolved during operations due to an on-going effort to increase the autonomous system’s robustness. The resulting increase in autonomy also increased system complexity. This investigation used Obstacle Analysis to identify and to reason incrementally about new requirements for handling failures and other anomalous events. Results reported in the paper show that Obstacle Analysis complemented standard safety-analysis techniques in identifying undesirable behaviors and ways to resolve them. The step-by-step use <b>of</b> <b>Obstacle</b> Analysis identified potential side effects and missing monitoring and control requirements. Adding an Availability Indicator and feature-interaction patterns proved useful for the analysis <b>of</b> <b>obstacle</b> resolutions.

40|$|A {{numerical}} simulation {{has been carried}} out to understand the thermo-hydrodynamics of single phase flow with obstacle in microchannel. In this study, two different shapes <b>of</b> <b>obstacle</b> are analyzed with five different substrate materials to study the effect of thermal conductivity on the heat transfer. Uniform heating source is present at bottom wall of microchannel and remaining walls are kept adiabatic. The flow rate is maintained such that flow will be laminar theoretically. But under influence <b>of</b> <b>obstacle,</b> fluid is likely to get disturbed as it flows past the obstacle. So, both laminar and turbulent model was used in this analysis. The other factor is considered is the position <b>of</b> <b>obstacle</b> in the flow. The positions <b>of</b> <b>obstacle</b> affect the mixing of layer of fluid. Analysis revels that position <b>of</b> <b>obstacle</b> in the flow field directly affect the heat transfer. Disturbance created at the initial stage carried to long distance which enhance heat transfer coefficient. It is found that the temperature difference between wall and fluid increase along the axial direction of flow except near the obstacle. In analysis, it is found that shape <b>of</b> <b>obstacle</b> directly affect the Nusselt number, for half <b>obstacle</b> variation <b>of</b> Nusselt number increase vibrantly as compared to full <b>obstacle.</b> In case <b>of</b> laminar model, it does not take account of eddies formation near the flow. Nor it accounts the surface roughness. While in turbulent model, eddies formation near the surface can be seen which in turn increase Nusselt number, when simulating both full and half obstacle using both laminar and turbulent model, it is found that higher Nusselt number is found in case of turbulent model, hence Nusselt number is reach to maximum in turbulent in comparison to laminar model...|$|R

5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set <b>of</b> <b>obstacles.</b>|$|E

5|$|Prior to the invasion, {{significant}} fortifications {{known as}} the Rupnik Line were constructed along the Italian and Reich borders, within what became the 7th Army's area of operations. Along the frontier with Italy, mutually supporting bunkers were established on forward slopes of the mountain ranges behind a belt <b>of</b> <b>obstacles.</b> The main positions followed a line from Mount Blegoš south-south-east through Hlavče Njive, Žirovski Vrh, Vrh Svetih Treh Kraljev, Zaplana, Mount Slivnica, Grahovo, and Lož to Petičak. To the north of Mount Blegoš, positions ran behind {{the lines of the}} Selška Sora and Sava Bohinjka rivers. Fortifications were also established in the mountainous Gorski kotar region between Karlovac and Fiume on the upper Adriatic coast. Along the Reich border, the Yugoslavs concentrated on preparing to block the passes through the Karawank and Kamnik Alps, and built bunkers behind obstacles along the routes leading south from the border towards Dravograd, Maribor and Ptuj. Preparations were also made to block routes north of the Drava and along the southern banks of the Mura and Drava. These fortifications were to be manned by border guard units, and were not the responsibility of the 7th Army.|$|E
