40|$|This study compares {{liquidity}} costs and other characteristics of electronic and open outcry hard red winter wheat futures contracts {{traded on the}} Kansas City Board of Trade. Liquidity costs are considerably lower in the electronic market than in the <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> <b>market.</b> A new approach is used to estimate {{liquidity costs}} which eliminates bias resulting from splitting of orders in electronic markets. The liquidity costs are still considerably lower after correcting the bias in electronic market. Liquidity costs were higher in after-hours trading as compared to regular trading hours suggesting a negative impact of volume on liquidity costs. Volatility of futures prices and volume per trade are positively related to liquidity costs, while a negative relation is found between daily volume and liquidity costs. Round-number pricing is more prevalent in the <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> <b>market.</b> Daily volumes were found distinctively higher during the rolling period {{as a result of}} Goldman-Sachs Roll.

40|$|The Bund (10 year German Government Bond) futures {{contract}} {{is the most}} actively traded bond contract in Europe; it is traded in both London (LIFFE) and Frankfurt (DTB) on open outcry and electronic trading platforms respectively. In an attempt to reconcile the conflicting results of earlier studies this paper evalutes the relative liquidity and price discovery roles of these two markets using data from 1995 Q 2. The paper finds that this conflict is largely {{a product of the}} price data used. Using both transactions prices and quotes data (on a minute by minute basis), variable transaction costs, i. e. spreads, are found to be similar on both markets. There is some evidence to suggest that the order processing component of the spread is larger on LIFFE, but that the compensation required for adverse selection risk is greater on the DTB. Also, the contribution to price formation of each market is found to be similar; there is no clear leader/follower relationship. The main differences between the two markets are the larger trade size on the <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> <b>market</b> and a tendency for trading to move toward the <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> <b>market</b> during volatile periods. ...|$|E

They find that trading profits of liquidity providers, locals, at the open outcry futures markets are mainly determined by market maker obligations (or, more aptly, lack thereof) and pit trading. In {{the absence of the}} trading pit at an electronic market, adverse selection and inventory management of voluntary liquidity providers affect trading profits of limit order traders {{in a manner similar to}} trading profits at transparent markets with liquidity supplied by competitive dealers. Examining separate evolutions of bid and ask quotes supports the notion that limit order traders pursue trading strategies different from those of locals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} design {{exploration}} for electronic futures exchange {{which is currently}} implemented a physical open outcry pit. The goal structure is characterized by competition {{at the individual level}} and cooperation at the group level. Individuals compete for trades in order to earn money, but must also agree to undertake a significant number of trades which do not earn them money in order to sustain the market. This goal structure makes the <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> <b>market</b> an example of a social dilemma. We analyze the social interaction fabric that exists in the open outcry environment and identify a set of intents that characterize the system. We then discuss how the affordances of the physical environment support the satisfaction of the intents. In the design exploration we examine which of these intents are still applicable in an electronic implementation and discuss how the affordances of this medium shape possible designs...|$|E
40|$|This study uses a vector error {{correction}} (VEC) model to examine price-volume relation-ships between <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> and e-trading at the Chicago Board of Trade. We test whether equilibrium price corrections on one system {{are independent of}} the other, and whether this price behavior is more sensitive to changes in screen-based volume as opposed to <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> volume. Error correction terms capture an asymmetric price adjustment process led by <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> trading. <b>Open</b> <b>outcry</b> volume (<b>market</b> depth) also results in price discovery by dampening price volatility on both markets. These aspects of market microstructure are relevant in identifying how newly introduced e-trading systems operate in relation to established <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> systems, and how e-trading systems may affect the economic performance of futures exchanges generally...|$|R
40|$|Screen-based futures {{markets are}} gaining trading volumes {{at the expense}} of {{traditional}} <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> floor <b>markets.</b> In comparison with <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> trading – used on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), the world largest futures market – electronic markets offer enhanced transparency, and greater access to users, who can enter orders directly. Screen markets can also maintain strict time priorities among submitted orders, and can provide incentives for users to place competitive orders and enhance the price discovery process. We describe several new screen-based markets, and examine in detail the Cantor Financial Futures Exchange (CFFE), a recently introduced screen market for Treasury futures contracts. The CFFE trading rules and order matching algorithm are shown to provide important incentives to place competitive quotes and supply liquidity. The design of an experimental economics study of the two alternative <b>market</b> structures – <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> and a screen mechanism – is described...|$|R
5000|$|A {{block trade}} is a permissible, noncompetitive, privately {{negotiated}} transaction either at or exceeding an exchange determined minimum threshold quantity of shares, which is executed apart {{and away from}} the <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> or electronic <b>markets.</b> [...] Major broker-dealers often provide “block trading” services—sometimes known as “upstairs trading desks”—to their institutional clients. In the United States and Canada a block trade is usually at least 10,000 shares of a stock or $100,000 of bonds but in practice significantly larger.|$|R
40|$|The European {{stock and}} {{commodity}} exchanges are nearly all electronic. Electronic trading also accounts {{for most of}} the volume on the Chicago exchanges. A closer look however, shows that a market traded through numerous widely dispersed computer screens is not necessarily more efficient or more liquid, particularly in the longer-dated months, than an <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> <b>market</b> that requires substantial physical space, a cadre of highly skilled traders, and a large and highly skilled support staff employed by both the firms represented on the floor as well as the exchange itself. The experience at NYMEX shows that there is a place for both open outcry and electronic trading. JEL classification : G 14, G 15, G 18 Newsome James.

25|$|The NYSE {{trades in}} a {{continuous}} auction format, where traders can execute stock transactions on behalf of investors. They will gather around the appropriate post where a specialist broker, who is employed by a NYSE member firm (that is, he/she is not {{an employee of the}} New York Stock Exchange), acts as an auctioneer in an <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> auction <b>market</b> environment to bring buyers and sellers together and to manage the actual auction. They do on occasion (approximately 10% of the time) facilitate the trades by committing their own capital {{and as a matter of}} course disseminate information to the crowd that helps to bring buyers and sellers together. The auction process moved toward automation in 1995 through the use of wireless hand held computers (HHC). The system enabled traders to receive and execute orders electronically via wireless transmission. On September 25, 1995, NYSE member Michael Einersen, who designed and developed this system, executed 1000 shares of IBM through this HHC ending a 203-year process of paper transactions and ushering in an era of automated trading.|$|R

40|$|Given the {{widespread}} transfer of trading to electronic platforms {{it is important}} to ask whether such trading is more efficient than traditional <b>open</b> <b>outcry.</b> To empirically assess this we examine the Crude Palm Oil market from 1995 : 06 to 2008 : 07 - a market where all trading swapped over from <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> to electronic trading at the end of 2001. Results indicate that both forms of trading are long-run efficient but that short-run inefficiencies do exist. Our main findings, derived from the application of a novel threshold autoregressive relative efficiency measure, is that market efficiency is conditional on (i) the volatility of the underlying asset (ii) the maturity of the futures contract and (iii) the market trading system. Specifically, bootstrap results from the efficiency measure suggest that the <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> trading method is superior for shorter maturities when volatility is high, and indistinguishable from electronic trading when volatility is low or maturity is long. These results suggest that electronic trading should not supersede <b>open</b> <b>outcry,</b> but rather that there are clear benefits to their coexistence...|$|R
