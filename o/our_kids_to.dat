Acharya referred to this as “reverse money laundering.” Aufhauser agreed; using traditional money laundering law enforcement tools to go after terrorist financing was a losing battle. Acharya writes, “Thus as David Aufhauser, former General Counsel of the US Treasury puts it, using anti-money laundering tools to target terrorist financing is like “looking at the world of financing from the wrong end of the telescope.’” ...|$|R
