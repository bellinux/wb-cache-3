40|$|Certain courses such {{as first}} and second year {{seminars}} and honors colloquia are particularly suited to exploring a new scholarship interest or catching up <b>on</b> recent developments <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>area</b> of research.

These courses are also {{a great place to}} begin scaffolding research skills for students. Clearly this is a benefit to students, but it also provides faculty with research mentees familiar with the faculty member’s research area. The purpose of this interactive presentation is to provide models for teaching seminars and colloquia that advance both the faculty member’s research agenda and the student’s research skills. The participants in this presentation will discuss their unique and creative approaches for teaching these courses. We will also discuss how this work can be incorporated in reappointment and promotion portfolios...|$|R
