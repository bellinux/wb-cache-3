40|$|The present work {{studied the}} adverse effects of {{maternal}} exposure of rats to alcohol during lactation, {{on the development of}} their offspring. Histometric evaluation by karyometry and of the alveolar bone {{at the level of the}} first upper molar of the sucking was perfomed. Two groups of animals, one coming from mothers exposed to drinking water containing 20 % ethanol during the total lactation period and the other of controls coming from mothers receiving <b>only</b> <b>alcohol-free</b> drinking water during this period. On the 21 first day of lactation the young of each group were aleatorily selected and following anesthesia, their heads severed; after histological treatment, serial 6 mu m sections on the frontal plane at the molar level, stained with hematoxilin and eosin, were obtained. The experimental results produced, suggest that sucking from ethanol-treated mothers, show retarded post-natal growth, their alveolar bones presenting scarce, little calcified trabeculae, and a more abundant bone marrow compared to controls...|$|E
