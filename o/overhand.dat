5|$|The fight {{began with}} Jackson taking {{the center of}} the cage as Silva circled outside. Jackson opened the action with an <b>overhand</b> right, and {{immediately}} moved backwards. Both fighters appeared cautious for the opening minutes of the fight, exchanging strikes and quickly moving away. Silva focused on leg kicks, while Jackson focused on working the jab.|$|E
5|$|While no {{official}} knot exists for tying the two {{ends of the}} thong together, the decorative diamond knot {{has become the most}} common. When produced, the thong is joined by a simple <b>overhand</b> knot and various region specific traditions have arisen around tying the diamond knot, including: having a fellow course member tie it; having a mentor or course leader tie it; and having the recipient tie it after completing some additional activity that shows he or she has mastered the skills taught to him or her during training.|$|E
5|$|Hughes faced BJ Penn on November 20, 2010, in {{a rubber}} match at , after their {{previous}} two fights at UFC 46 and UFC 63. Penn came out {{strong in the}} first few seconds of the opening round, catching one of Hughes' kicks and knocking him off balance with a counter hook. Penn then connected with an <b>overhand</b> right that dropped Hughes, following up with three clean shots to the jaw. The bout was ended at 21 seconds into the first round, with Hughes trilogy against Penn ending at 1-2. The fight marked the first time Hughes had been knocked out (he had previously lost via technical knockout). Post-fight Hughes hinted that the loss moved him one step closer to retirement.|$|E

2500|$|Brought {{up in the}} MMA system, Poirier is a well rounded fighter. In close range, Poirier utilises power punches like <b>overhands,</b> as seen in his {{bout with}} Diego Brandao. He also uses jabs and teeps to set up more {{powerful}} strikes, like a cross. Some media outlets say that Poirier has powerful left hooks and front kicks. [...] Other outlets regard Poirier's footwork as average and his strike defences as lacking.|$|R
5|$|Whereas many {{pitchers}} throw with a three-quarter or sidearm motion, Koufax threw with {{a pronounced}} over-the-top arm action. This may have increased his velocity, but reduced the lateral movement on his pitches, especially {{movement away from}} left-handed hitters. Most of his velocity came from his strong legs and back, combined with a high kicking wind-up and long forward stretch toward the plate. Throughout his career, Koufax relied mostly on two pitches. His four-seam fastball gave batters the impression of rising as it approached them, due to underspin. It not only appeared to move very late but also might move two or three distinct times. His <b>overhand</b> curveball, spun with the middle finger, dropped vertically 12 to 24inches due to his arm action. Rob Neyer called it the best curve of all time. He also occasionally threw a changeup and a forkball.|$|E
25|$|<b>Overhand</b> right : The <b>overhand</b> {{right is}} a punch {{not found in}} every boxer's arsenal. Unlike the right cross, which has a {{trajectory}} parallel to the ground, the <b>overhand</b> right has a looping circular arc as it is thrown over the shoulder with the palm facing away from the boxer. It is especially popular with smaller stature boxers trying to reach taller opponents. Boxers who have used this punch consistently and effectively include former heavyweight champions Rocky Marciano and Tim Witherspoon, as well as MMA champions Chuck Liddell and Fedor Emelianenko. The <b>overhand</b> right has become a popular weapon in other tournaments that involve fist striking.|$|E
25|$|The league moved {{fully to}} <b>overhand</b> {{pitching}} in 1948, {{which made the}} game close to regulation baseball. Such change adversely affected the performance of underhand pitchers, because {{many of them were}} experienced submariners who could not make the transition to the new pitching style. Consequently, many teams converted their outfielders to pitchers since they were used to throwing the ball <b>overhand</b> with power. Batters, too, had to make adjustments, since underhand pitches tend to rise, <b>overhand</b> to drop. In that season also were incorporated the Chicago Colleens and the Springfield Sallies, and the AAGPBL expanded to a historical peak of ten teams divided into Eastern and Western Divisions.|$|E
50|$|The punch {{techniques}} in muay Thai were originally quite limited being crosses {{and a long}} (or lazy) circular strike made with a straight (but not locked) arm and landing {{with the heel of}} the palm. Cross-fertilization with Western boxing and western martial arts mean the full range of western boxing punches are now used: lead jab, straight/cross, hook, uppercut, shovel and corkscrew punches and <b>overhands</b> as well as hammer fists and back fists.|$|R
50|$|By 1895 the new {{sea wall}} {{had been built}} and a rough narrow roadway was available. The route was still {{hazardous}} from wave action and from rockfalls from <b>overhands</b> on the cliffs along the road. It had looped ropes and lifebuoys along the seawall. By late 1897 the road had been surfaced with gravel. Substantial stanchions and chains were installed along the western section of the wall-top with money donated by John Tinline, a pioneer settler, and Mr Tyler, an Englishman, by early 1898.|$|R
50|$|Northwest Regional style {{architecture}} is an architectural style {{popular in the}} Pacific Northwest between 1935 and 1960. It is a regional variant of the International style. It {{is defined by the}} extensive use of unpainted wood in both interiors and exteriors. Other features of the style include integration of the building with its setting through asymmetrical floor plans, extensive use of glass extending to the floor, a low-pitched or flat roof of shingles with <b>overhanding</b> eaves, and a minimum of decoration. It is sometimes known as Northwest Modern.|$|R
25|$|Serving is the act {{of putting}} the ball into play by {{striking}} it with the hand or arm from behind the rear court boundary. Serving can {{take the form of}} an underhand serve, <b>overhand</b> serve or a jump serve. The underhand and <b>overhand</b> serves are similar on the beach and indoors, with the exception that on the beach the wind often has a significant effect on the trajectory of the ball. Although the serve can be used as an offensive weapon, most rallies are won by the receiving team, as they have the first attack opportunity.|$|E
25|$|On September 6, 2008, Liddell fought Rashad Evans at UFC 88. Liddell was {{defeated}} 1:51 {{of the second}} round after Evans connected with an <b>overhand</b> right, causing Liddell to fall unconscious to the mat.|$|E
25|$|Angelo Dundee {{wrote that}} Norton's best punch was the left hook. Many others lauded his infamous <b>overhand</b> right. In a Ring Magazine article, Norton himself {{said that a}} right uppercut to Jerry Quarry was the hardest blow he {{recalled}} landing.|$|E
50|$|Anna lent her friendshipbook to Anton {{so he will}} be {{the first}} human who'll write {{something}} in the book. The book ends up in hands of Geiermeier who now thinks Anton and his parents are vampires. Next morning, Geiermeier sneaks into the bedroom of Anton's parents and is about to stick them. Anton can prevent this by opening the curtains so he can prove he and his parents can stand the sunlight. Due to Anton's fascination of horror, Geiermeier concludes the book contains stories made up by Anton and <b>overhands</b> to book. Anton returns it to Anna. Due to the nightly escapades Anton's school results are decreasing. That's why his school teacher, Miss Schlauberger, wants a meeting with his parents.|$|R
5000|$|Overeem is {{considered}} one of the best rounded heavyweights in the sport, though he is mainly known for his excellence and power on the striking field. A kickboxer of the Dutch school of Muay Thai decorated in K-1 world tournaments, Overeem favours kicks to the body and legs and knee strikes from the clinch, which have been described as [...] "devastating." [...] His most famous finishing technique used to be the left knee to the midsection, which has served him to end many fights, but he switched to the left body kick instead late on his career. He is also proficient with left <b>overhands</b> and hooks once his opponents are worn down. On the grappling field, Overeem is universally known for his usage of the guillotine choke, a simple technique he uses to great effect thanks to his strength and height. Overeem was labeled as [...] "the best grappler in Europe" [...] after submitting all his opponents in the ADCC 2005 tryouts through this move.|$|R
5000|$|Typical type II {{restriction}} enzymes {{differ from}} type I restriction enzymes in several ways. They form homodimers, with recognition {{sites that are}} usually undivided and palindromic and 4-8 nucleotides in length. They recognize and cleave DNA at the same site, {{and they do not}} use ATP or AdoMet for their activity—they usually require only Mg2+ as a cofactor. [...] These enzymes cleave the phosphodiester bond of double helix DNA. It can either cleave at the center of both strands to yield a blunt end. Or it can cleave at a staggered position leaving <b>overhands</b> called sticky ends. These are the most commonly available and used restriction enzymes. In the 1990s and early 2000s, new enzymes from this family were discovered that did not follow all the classical criteria of this enzyme class, and new subfamily nomenclature was developed to divide this large family into subcategories based on deviations from typical characteristics of type II enzymes. These subgroups are defined using a letter suffix.|$|R
25|$|The {{traditional}} grip, {{originally developed}} {{for playing the}} military side drum, most commonly with an <b>overhand</b> grip for the right hand and an underhand for the left. It arose from the need to clear the counter-hoop (rim) of an angled marching drum (due to the single-point attachment of the drum sling).|$|E
25|$|That {{same year}} of 1949, Hardwick was Robinson's {{sparring}} {{partner at the}} welterweight king's training camp in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey. Robinson was training for a fight with Steve Belloise and was at his peak. In one session, Hardwick landed a short <b>overhand</b> right to Robinson's chin and dropped him in the second round.|$|E
25|$|In its 12 {{years of}} history the AAGPBL evolved through many stages. These {{differences}} varied {{from the beginning of}} the league, progressively extending the length of the base paths and pitching distance and decreasing the size of the ball until the final year of play. For the first four years the circuit used a fastpitch underhand motion and shifted to sidearm in 1947, until <b>overhand</b> pitching became effective in 1948.|$|E
6000|$|Isobel went to Mexico {{with her}} uncle {{and there had}} a most {{interesting}} time. She studied Aztec history with her usual thoroughness; so well, indeed, that she became a recognised authority on the subject. She climbed Popocatepetl, the mysterious [...] "Sleeping Woman" [...] that <b>overhands</b> the ancient town, and looked into its crater. Greatly daring, she even visited Yucatan and {{saw some of the}} pre-Aztec remains. For this adventure she paid with an attack of fever which never quite left her system. Indeed, that fever had a peculiar effect upon her, which may have been physical or something else. Isobel's fault, or rather characteristic, as the reader may have gathered, was that she built too much upon the material side of things. What she saw, what she knew, what her body told her, what the recorded experience of the world taught--these were real; all the rest, to her, was phantasy or imagination. She kept her feet upon the solid ground of fact, and left all else to dreamers; or, as she would have expressed it, to the victims of superstition inherited or acquired.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a {{theoretical}} analysis of the hinge-moment characteristics of various sealed-internal-balance arrangements for control surfaces are presented. The analysis considered <b>overhands</b> sealed to various types of wing structure by flexible seals spanning gaps of various widths or sealed to the wing structure by a flexible system of linked plates. Leakage was not considered; the seal was assumed to extend the full spanwise length of the control surface. The effect of the developed width of the flexible seal and of the geometry of the structure to which the seal was anchored was investigated, {{as well as the}} effect of the gap width that is sealed. The results of the investigation indicated that the most nearly linear control-surface hinge-moment characteristics can probably be obtained from a flexible seal over a narrow gap (about 0. 1 of the overhang chord), which is so installed that the motion of the seal is restricted to a region behind the point of attachment of the seal to the wing structure. Control-surface hinge moments that tend to be high at large deflections and low or overbalanced at small deflections will result if a very narrow seal is used...|$|R
5000|$|The lophophore {{and mouth}} are {{mounted on a}} {{flexible}} tube, called the [...] "invert" [...] {{because it can be}} turned inside-out and withdrawn into the polypide, rather like the finger of a rubber glove; in this position the lophophore lies inside the invert and is folded like the spokes of an umbrella. The invert is withdrawn, sometimes within 60 milliseconds, by a pair of retractor muscles that are anchored {{at the far end of}} the cystid. Sensors at the tips of the tentacles may check for signs of danger before the invert and lophophore are fully extended. Extension is driven by an increase in internal fluid pressure, which species with flexible exoskeletons produce by contracting circular muscles that lie just inside the body wall, while species with a membranous sac use circular muscles to squeeze this. Some species with rigid exoskeletons have a flexible membrane that replaces part of the exoskeleton, and transverse muscles anchored on the far side of the exoskeleton increase the fluid pressure by pulling the membrane inwards. In others there is no gap in the protective skeleton, and the transverse muscles pull on a flexible sac which is connected to the water outside by a small pore; the expansion of the sac increases the pressure inside the body and pushes the invert and lophophore out. In some species the retracted invert and lophophore are protected by an operculum ("lid"), which is closed by muscles and opened by fluid pressure. In one class, a hollow lobe called the [...] "epistome" [...] <b>overhands</b> the mouth.|$|R
25|$|In {{front of}} 16,144 at the MGM Grand, Mayweather {{defeated}} Maidana via unanimous decision. Unlike the first fight, Mayweather came out {{better prepared for}} Maidana's style. The final judges scores were 115–112, 116–111, and 116–111. ESPN scored it wider for Mayweather at 119–108. Mayweather did not allow Maidana to land any <b>overhand</b> right, with the punch stats showing Maidana connecting 128 of 572 shots (22%). Mayweather had 51% connect rate landing 166 of 326.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 the AAGPBL {{expanded}} to a historical peak of ten clubs {{divided into two}} divisions representing Eastern and Western zones. The Eastern division included the Chicago Colleens, Fort Wayne Daisies, Grand Rapids Chicks, Muskegon Lassies and South Bend Blue Sox teams, while the Kenosha Comets, Peoria Redwings, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and Springfield Sallies played in the Western Division. At the same time, the league made the switch from side-arm to <b>overhand</b> pitching.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Faut {{missed the}} spring {{training}} camp {{to be held}} in March and reported to the Blue Sox after her postnatal period. She recovered her old form in mid-June, determined to adjust her arm angle on her pitching deliveries. This change to <b>overhand</b> pitching did not mean that a pitcher could not drop down in her delivery. Occasionally, Faut threw a pitch below sidearm to keep opposing hitters off balance with an array of five quality pitches. She still produced a fine season, fashioning a 16–11 record with 165 strikeouts and a 1.44 ERA in 34 games, hurling 250 innings, ranking seventh among pitchers with at least 45 or more innings, ending seventh in ERA and eighth in strikeouts. The smaller ball and <b>overhand</b> delivery made her curveball pitch more effective. That season, Grand Rapids' Alice Haylett went 25–5 with a league-best 0.77 ERA, while Racine's Joanne Winter finished 25–12 and led in strikeouts (248). On September 4, Faut pitched her first no-hitter, beating the host Racine Belles, 7–0. Her teammate Lillian Faralla had thrown a no-hitter against Racine on May 11, so two Blue Sox pitchers defeated the Belles with two no-hitters in the same season.|$|E
25|$|He {{qualified}} for the 1997 K-1 GP when he beat James Warring at the K-1 Grand Prix '97 1st Round on September 7, 1997. At {{the beginning of the}} fight, Warring pretended that he wanted to sportsmanly touch gloves with Aerts and then attempted to sneakily punch him with a right <b>overhand</b> when he got close to him. Aerts was able to dominate the rest of the fight before knocking him cold with a right high kick in round three.|$|E
25|$|Nogueira faced Roy Nelson on April 11, 2014, in {{the main}} event at UFC Fight Night 39. After {{dropping}} Nogueira several times with punches in the first round, Nelson finished the fight via knockout with an <b>overhand</b> right. On June 17, 2014, Nogueira underwent successful surgery to repair a partial ACL tear of his right knee. On February 9, 2015, it was announced Nogueira would replace Anderson Silva {{as a head coach}} on , after Silva was removed following his failed drug test.|$|E
25|$|Six {{months after}} his loss to Frank Mir, Sylvia {{returned}} (a titanium plate had been attached to his forearm) to the UFC in February 2005, taking on Andrei Arlovski to crown an interim UFC heavyweight champion as Mir, while still the nominal UFC champion, had suffered numerous injuries from a motorcycle accident that left him unable to defend his title. Sylvia was knocked to the ground by an <b>overhand</b> right punch, and while on the ground was caught in an Achilles lock and submitted.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, {{the league}} {{switched}} over to <b>overhand</b> pitching {{and moved the}} mound back further. Lee returned to Fort Wayne Daisies and went 10–14 with a 2.25 ERA in 27 games. She allowed 78 runs, 56 earned, while striking out 56 batters. The Daisies finished fourth in the Eastern Division (53-72) and advanced to the playoffs, beating the Muskegon Lassies {{in the first round}} (3-to-1) and Grand Rapids in the semi-finals (3-to-0), but were defeated by Rockford in the best-of-seven series, four to one games.|$|E
25|$|Experienced players {{strive to}} master the {{conventional}} <b>overhand</b> serve to maximize its power and placement. The server may employ different types of serve including flat serve, topspin serve, slice serve, and kick (American twist) serve. A reverse type of spin serve is hit {{in a manner that}} spins the ball opposite the natural spin of the server, the spin direction depending upon right- or left-handedness. If the ball is spinning counterclockwise, it will curve right from the hitter's point of view and curve left if spinning clockwise.|$|E
25|$|A hard-throwing hurler, Eleanor Moore {{played with}} four {{different}} teams of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League {{during the final}} five years of its existence. It was during this time period that <b>overhand</b> pitching and smaller ball sizes were adopted, which benefited hitters but was detrimental to a pitchers success. By the time her final season ended in 1954, Moore had fashioned a 49–46 pitching record (.516) with a 2.74 earned run average, including a no-hitter, an All-Star Team selection, and the lead for the most wins in a single-season.|$|E
25|$|During early {{fights in}} her MMA career, Rousey mainly used {{striking}} {{to set up}} judo. She became a more proficient striker following her UFC debut, leading to her first wins by way of stoppage. While standing, Rousey normally uses jabs, knees, and <b>overhand</b> rights. She also seldom stands side on with a set boxing stance, but rather squaring up to the opponent, but still generate great striking power, especially when they are near the fence, or clinching opponents with the left hand to close the distance, while pummeling opponents with strikes, much akin to a muay thai fighter launching kickers from the clinch.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, a {{motorcycle}} accident injury suffered by then UFC Heavyweight Champion Frank Mir {{led to the}} creation of an interim heavyweight title. It was decided that the two top heavyweight contenders would meet to declare the interim champion and on February 5, 2005, at UFC 51, Arlovski faced former heavyweight champion, Tim Sylvia. In the fight, Arlovski eventually connected with an <b>overhand</b> right and dropped Sylvia. On the ground, Arlovski followed up with an Achilles lock that forced Sylvia to tap out at 47 seconds of the first round, making Arlovski the new UFC Interim Heavyweight Champion.|$|E
25|$|Wagner {{moved to}} the Parichy Bloomer Girls of the National Girls Baseball League (NGBL) in 1950, because she was offered a higher salary, a signing bonus and no {{extensive}} travelling. Audrey only contemplated moving to the NGBL due to a disagreement with management. Additionally, the games were played in the Chicago area, so she would be home every night closer to school and her studies. Whereas the AAGPBL gradually evolved from softball to an almost standard hardball, with longer bases and sidearm or <b>overhand</b> pitching, the NGBL used a ball larger than that used in the AAGPBL, featured the traditional underhand pitching and base paths stayed shorter.|$|E
