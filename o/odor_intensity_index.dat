40|$|The {{objectives}} of the present work were to examine the relationships between sensory assessments of air quality made using different methods: <b>odor</b> <b>intensity</b> by category scale, category-ratio scale and equal-intensity matching with acetone as a reference and acceptability scale, and to study whether the assessments of acceptability {{can be explained by}} selected characteristics of the air. A sensory panel assessed the air polluted by emissions from different building materials at different area-specific ventilation rates. The three assessments of <b>odor</b> <b>intensity</b> were linearly strongly correlated with each other. Therefore, for practical applications it seems feasible to apply only one of the investigated methods. <b>Odor</b> <b>intensity</b> was strongly correlated with the assessments of acceptability of the air.

40|$|The {{olfactory}} {{evaluation function}} (e. g., <b>odor</b> <b>intensity</b> rating) of e-nose is always {{one of the}} most challenging issues in researches about odor pollution monitoring. But odor is normally produced by a set of stimuli, and odor interactions among constituents significantly influenced their mixture’s <b>odor</b> <b>intensity.</b> This study investigated the odor interaction principle in odor mixtures of aldehydes and esters, respectively. Then, a modified vector model (MVM) was proposed and it successfully demonstrated the similarity of the odor interaction pattern among odorants of the same type. Based on the regular interaction pattern, unlike a determined empirical model only fit for a specific odor mixture in conventional approaches, the MVM distinctly simplified the <b>odor</b> <b>intensity</b> prediction of <b>odor</b> mixtures. Furthermore, the MVM also provided a way of directly converting constituents’ chemical concentrations to their mixture’s <b>odor</b> <b>intensity.</b> By combining the MVM with usual data-processing algorithm of e-nose, a new e-nose system was established for an <b>odor</b> <b>intensity</b> rating. Compared with instrumental analysis and human assessor, it exhibited accuracy well in both quantitative analysis (Pearson correlation coefficient was 0. 999 for individual aldehydes (n = 12), 0. 996 for their binary mixtures (n = 36) and 0. 990 for their ternary mixtures (n = 60)) and <b>odor</b> <b>intensity</b> assessment (Pearson correlation coefficient was 0. 980 for individual aldehydes (n = 15), 0. 973 for their binary mixtures (n = 24), and 0. 888 for their ternary mixtures (n = 25)).

Several binary mixtures of benzene and substituted benzenes were respectively tested to establish the PDE models.

If combining the PDE model with portable gas detectors or on-line monitoring systems, olfactory evaluation of <b>odor</b> <b>intensity</b> will be achieved by instruments instead of odor assessors. Many disadvantages (e. g., expense on a fixed number of odor assessors) also will be successfully avoided.

Following directional difference testing, panelists used FPA and evaluated water samples that contained odorants at either 25 oC or 45 oC. Samples containing geosmin cooled to 5 oC were also evaluated. Sensory analyses experiments indicate that <b>odor</b> <b>intensity</b> is a function of both aqueous concentration and water temperature for geosmin, MIB, nonadienal, n-hexanal, free chlorine, and 1 -butanol.

Hence it is vitally important to choose an appropriate and comprehensive earthquake <b>intensity</b> <b>index</b> to correlate well to a structural performance. In this study, a total of 30 earthquake <b>intensity</b> <b>indices</b> published in the literature are reviewed and are evaluated through correlation analysis based on 60 ground motion records. Examined herein is the correlation between existing earthquake <b>intensity</b> <b>indices</b> and the seismic responses of elastoplastic SDOF and MDOF systems. The characteristics and applicability of such indices are also discussed in some details, based on which appropriate earthquake <b>intensity</b> <b>indices</b> are recommended. ...|$|R
40|$|Using a T-shirt {{test design}} {{described}} by M. Schleidt and co-workers with young female (n = 29) and male (n = 30) respondents, {{the relations between}} concentration, <b>odor</b> <b>intensity,</b> <b>odor</b> pleasantness, and sex attribution were studied for female and male perspiration, androstenol (I, a natural ingredient of perspira-tion), for two synthetic androstenol analogues (II and III), and for cyclopentadecanolide, a synthetic musk. It {{was found that the}} synthetic analogue III and, to a lesser extent, II exhibit patterns similar to the natural stimuli. Cyclopentadecanolide was perceived more as a feminine perfume...|$|R
40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that genes within the {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) somehow affect the production of body odors in several vertebrates, including humans. Here we discuss whether variation in the <b>intensity</b> of body <b>odors</b> {{may be influenced by}} the MHC. In order to examine this question, we have to control for MHC-linked odor perception on the smeller's side. Such a control is necessary because the perception of pleasantness and intensity seem to be confounded, and the causalities are still unsolved. It has previously been found that intense odors are scored as less pleasant if the signaler and the receiver are of MHC-dissimilar type, but not if they are of MHC similar type. We argue, and first data suggest, that an effect of the degree of MHC-heterozygosity and <b>odor</b> <b>intensity</b> is likely (MHC-homozygotes may normally smell more intense), while there is currently no strong argument for other possible links between the MHC and body <b>odor</b> <b>intensity...</b>|$|R
