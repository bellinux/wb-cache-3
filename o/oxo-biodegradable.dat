50|$|Degradation is {{a process}} that takes place in many materials.

5000|$|The term [...] "biodegradable plastic" [...] {{has also}} been used by {{producers}} of specially modified petrochemical-based plastics that appear to biodegrade. Biodegradable plastic bag manufacturers that have misrepresented their product's biodegradability may now face legal action in the US state of California for the misleading use of the terms biodegradable or compostable. Traditional plastics such as polyethylene are degraded by ultra-violet (UV) light and oxygen. To prevent this, process manufacturers add stabilising chemicals. However, {{with the addition of}} a degradation initiator to the plastic, it is possible to achieve a controlled UV/oxidation disintegration process. This type of plastic may be referred to as degradable plastic or oxy-degradable plastic or photodegradable plastic because the process is not initiated by microbial action. While some degradable plastics manufacturers argue that degraded plastic residue will be attacked by microbes, these degradable materials do not meet the requirements of the EN13432 commercial composting standard. The bioplastics industry has widely criticized <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> plastics, which the industry association says do not meet its requirements. <b>Oxo-biodegradable</b> plastics - known as [...] "oxos" [...] - are conventional petroleum-based products with some additives that initiate degradation. The ASTM standard for oxo-biodegradables is called the Standard Guide for Exposing and Testing Plastics that Degrade in the Environment by a Combination of Oxidation and Biodegradation (ASTM 6954). Both EN 13432 and ASTM 6400 are specifically designed for PLA and Starch based products and should not be used as a guide for oxos.|$|E

40|$|Growing {{concerns}} regarding {{the impact of}} the accumulation of plastic waste over several decades on the environmental have {{led to the development of}} biodegradable plastic. These plastics can be degraded by microorganisms and absorbed by the environment and are therefore gaining public support as a possible alternative to petroleum-derived plastics. Among the developed biodegradable plastics, <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> polymers have been used to produce plastic bags. Exposure of this waste plastic to ultraviolet light (UV) or heat can lead to breakage of the polymer chains in the plastic, and the resulting compounds are easily degraded by microorganisms. However, few studies have characterized the microbial degradation of <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> plastics. In this study, we tested the capability of Pleurotus ostreatus to degrade <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> (D 2 W) plastic without prior physical treatment, such as exposure to UV or thermal heating. After 45 d of incubation in substrate-containing plastic bags, the <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> plastic, which is commonly used in supermarkets, developed cracks and small holes in the plastic surface as a result of the formation of hydroxyl groups and carbon-oxygen bonds. These alterations may be due to laccase activity. Furthermore, we observed the degradation of the dye found in these bags as well as mushroom formation. Thus, P. ostreatus degrades <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> plastics and produces mushrooms using this plastic as substrate...|$|E

To study the degradation of the plastic polymers, <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> plastic bags were exposed to sunlight for up to 120 days, and fragments of these bags were used as substrates for P. ostreatus. We observed that physical treatment alone was not sufficient to initiate degradation. Instead, mechanical modifications and reduced titanium oxide (TiO 2) concentrations caused by sunlight exposure triggered microbial degradation.

40|$|The best {{approach}} to induce oxo-biodegradation in polyethylene {{is the use}} of special additives known as pro-oxidants. Pro-oxidants accelerate abiotic oxidation and subsequent polymer chain cleavage rendering the product apparently more susceptible to biodegradation. In this work, the abiotic oxidation is studied to understand how the addition of nanoclay affects the oxidation rate and the degradation mechanism of <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> polyethylene. In order to achieve this, the following materials were used in this study: (1) polyethylene (PE), (2) <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> polyethylene (OPE), (3) polyethylene nanocomposite (PENac), and (4) <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> polyethylene nanocomposite (OPENac). Wide-Angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) studies reveal that grafting in the preparation of composites helps to achieve mixed intercalated/exfoliated morphology in PENac and OPENac. Abiotic oxidation was carried out in an oven for a period of 14 days at 70 °C with air supply. The effect of abiotic oxidation was evaluated by measuring the changes in tensile strength, elongation at break, carbonyl index and molecular weight.

40|$|The present work aims to {{evaluate}} and improve the oxo-biodegradation process of polyethylene. To achieve this, {{an attempt was made}} to fully understand the oxo-biodegradation process by conducting degradability tests on polyethylene and <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> polyethylene (polyethylene loaded with pro-oxidants). Pro-oxidants are transition metal ion complexes which catalyse the oxidation of polyethylene leading to molecular weight reduction facilitating biodegradation. The biodegradation of polyethylene was achieved using the micro-organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the degradation experiments, polyethylene film samples were subjected to thermal oxidation for a period of two weeks followed by six weeks of biodegradation. The changes in the molecular weight of polyethylene and the concentration of oxidation products were monitored by size exclusion chromatography and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, respectively. After initial thermal oxidation, molecular weight of <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> polyethylene was found to decrease rapidly, accompanied by the formation of low molecular weight carbonyl compounds. These end chain oxidation products are then utilised by microbes in the biodegradation stage. However the influence of microbes is found to occur only on the polymer surface suggesting that the action of pro-oxidant is limited to the oxidation process and is not continued during the microbial degradation stage. This work also attempts to improve the overall process of oxo-biodegradation of polyethylene using nanoclay along with a pro-oxidant. Polyethylene nanocomposites were prepared by melt intercalating maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene and montmorillonite clay. It was found that maleic anhydride promotes strong interactions between polyethylene and montmorillonite, leading to a homogeneous dispersion of clay layers. Rheological tests showed that these nanocomposites exhibit shear thinning behaviour, with steady shear viscosities increasing proportionally with clay concentrations. With increase in clay concentration, the tensile strength of nanocomposites increases whereas the elongation at break decreases considerably and barrier properties are found to improve significantly with clay content. On comparing the oxo-biodegradation results of polyethylene, <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> polyethylene, polyethylene- and <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> polyethylene nanocomposites, it is found that the molecular weights of both <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> polyethylene and <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> polyethylene nanocomposite decrease substantially as oxidation proceeds. However, the relationship between the carbonyl index (another measure of concentration of carbonyl compounds) and the molecular weight data reveals that the addition of nanoclay does not alter the oxidation mechanism significantly suggesting that the reduction in molecular weight of these two materials is mainly due to the action of pro-oxidant. When oxidised (aged) polyethylene- and <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> nanocomposites are subjected to microbial degradation using Pseudomonas aeruginosa, their degradation patterns as indicated by their molecular weight distributions data vary. This could probably be either due to some active role of Pseudomonas aeruginosa leading to further chain cleavage of the polymer or due to the presence of clay that made a difference in the biotic environment. It is clear that montmorillonite has helped in creating a suitable biotic environment conducive to microbial activity and therefore supported the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which causes further biodegradation of the polymer in nanocomposites...|$|E

40|$|Polyethylene (PE) {{is widely}} used in {{packaging}} and agricultural industries because of its low cost and unique combination of properties such as high strength, light weight, water resistance, high stability and ease of fabrication. Each year {{a considerable amount of}} PE waste accumulates at landfill sites, and it takes a very long time to biodegrade. Since PE waste is not always retained in the upper level of a landfill for a long time, it can undergo very limited oxidation. In an attempt to solve the polymer degradation problem, researchers have identified a simple and inexpensive method that involves blending PE with pro-oxidants, which enhances oxidation significantly. The PE-pro-oxidant blend, known as <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> polyethylene, has been found to undergo oxidation rapidly but experiences very little biodegradation. This work aims to evaluate the suitability of polyethylene-layered silicate nanocomposites as a biodegradable polymer that can degrade through the oxo-biodegradation process. One of the main objectives of the thesis is to investigate the combined effect of nanoclay and a commercial pro-oxidant on the photo-degradation and biodegradation of PE. This study also investigates whether the roles of nanoclay and pro-oxidant in biodegradation can be achieved by using modified nanoclay that has been prepared by synthesising a pro-oxidant on the surface of unmodified MMT. In conclusion, nanoclay in <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> PE nanocomposites enhances both the photo-oxidation and biodegradation of polyethylene.

40|$|Polyethylene is {{the most}} widely used polymer in various {{industrial}} and day-to-day consumer applications. However, the widespread use of polyethylene has led to a problem called ‘plastic pollution’. Among the several strategies used to solve the plastic pollution, the most effective one seems to be the production of degradable plastics. Degradable plastics are made by blending polymer with additives such as metal ions and naturally biodegradable polymers which enhance the degradability of plastics. Degradable polyethylene disintegrates into smaller fragments in the presence of heat, light and oxygen. However, these small fragments remain in the environment for very long period and contaminate soil and water. To make polyethylene completely biodegradable, the smaller fragments must be made consumable to microorganisms which convert them into CO 2 and water during their metabolism. Current knowledge on the mechanisms of polyethylene biodegradation is far from complete and therefore more research is required in this area. Previous studies on polyethylene degradability have shown that degradability is enhanced remarkably by incorporating metal ions called pro-oxidant into the polymer matrix. Recent studies showed that clay-based polyethylene nanocomposites have better biodegradability. The role of clay, however, on the degradation of polyethylene has not been completely understood yet. The main objective of this work is to investigate the combined effects of manganese stearate as pro-oxidant and nanoclay on polyethylene biodegradation. It is also aimed to develop a mathematical model for predicting the biodegradation rate of <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> polyethylene nanocomposites (nanocomposites with pro-oxidant) using the experimental data. Films of polyethylene nanocomposites and <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> polyethylene nanocomposites were prepared using melt intercalation followed by film blowing. Biodegradation study was carried out in two stages: abiotic stage and biotic stage. Abiotic degradation was achieved by subjecting the film samples to heat at 70 °C. Thermally degraded samples were then subjected to biodegradation in a closely monitored composting system according to AS-ISO 14855. Thermally degraded samples were subjected to TGA and FTIR analysis. Biodegradation was monitored by measuring the volume of CO 2 produced as a function of time. Biodegraded film samples were also subjected to ESEM (bio-film growth) and FTIR analysis. Experimental results show that manganese stearate helps in different aspects of both abiotic and biotic stages of biodegradation.  However, the presence of clay itself has no significant effect on the thermal degradation of polyethylene nanocomposites. But nanoclay has been found to enhance the overall degradation by either catalysing the thermal oxidation or making the material suitable for the growth of microorganisms. Extensive degradation observed in <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> nanocomposites indicates that co-existence of manganese stearate and nanoclay in polyethylene structure is vital to achieve an effective biodegradation process. CO 2 evolution data obtained in biodegradation studies were used to develop a mathematical model that describes the biodegradation behaviour of polymer samples used. It has been found that biodegradation of <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> polyethylene can be represented by a mathematical model similar to the one that represents bacterial growth. This model equation will be a useful tool to analyse the kinetics of biodegradation and estimate the biodegradation potential of polyethylene compounds...|$|E
40|$|Oxo-biodegradation of {{polyethylene}} {{has been}} well studied with different pro-oxidants {{and it has been}} shown that pro-oxidants have limited role in the oxidation of polyethylene and do not have any role in microbial growth. However, in few recent studies, montmorillonite clay has been reported to promote the growth of microbes by keeping the pH of the environment at levels conducive to growth. In an attempt to improve the overall oxo-biodegradation of polyethylene, montmorillonite nanoclay has been used in this study along with a prooxidant. Film samples of <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> polyethylene (OPE) and <b>oxo-biodegradable</b> polyethylene nanocomposite (OPENac) were subjected to abiotic oxidation followed by microbial degradation using microorganism Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The progress of degradation was followed by monitoring the chemical changes of the samples using high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The growth of bacteria on the surface of the polymer was monitored using environmental scanning electron microscopy. GPC data and FTIR results have shown that the abiotic oxidation of polyethylene is influenced significantly by the pro-oxidant but not by nanoclay. But, the changes in molecular weight distribution and FTIR spectra for the biodegraded samples indicate that the growth rate of P. aeruginosa on OPENac is significantly greater than that on OPE.
