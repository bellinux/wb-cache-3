50|$|A {{hierarchy}} {{is typically}} visualized as a pyramid, where {{the height of}} the ranking or person depicts their power status and the width of that level represents how many people or business divisions are at that level relative to the whole—the highest-ranking people are at the apex, and there are very few of them; the base may include thousands of people who have no subordinates. These hierarchies are typically depicted with a tree or triangle diagram, creating an organizational chart or <b>organigram.</b> Those nearest the top have more power than those nearest the bottom, and there being fewer people at the top than at the bottom. As a result, superiors in a hierarchy generally have higher status and command greater rewards than their subordinates.|$|E

Most importantly, it helped to illuminate the role of two professors (we call them in the following Prof. A and Prof. B) who were frequently mentioned by interviewees as core agents in shaping entrepreneurial culture and the institutional landscape for supporting research commercialization in the region, but repeatedly declined interview requests. Particularly, in cases in which field access proved to be difficult, the approach of triangulating methods allowed gaining a well-rounded analysis of different kinds of agency in AE in this region.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Some wikis support virtual {{communities}} that are built around the wiki itself (e. g., Wikipedia). By contrast, corporate wikis are not created in a vacuum since the community already exists. Documentation, <b>organigrams,</b> etc are all there {{by the time the}} wiki is created. The wiki should then be tuned to the existing information ecosystem. That is, wiki concerns (e. g., categories, permissions) are to be influenced by the corporate settings. So far, all wikis are created equal: empty. This paper advocates for corporate wikis to be initialized with a wiki scaffolding: a wiki installation where some categories, permissions, etc, are initialized to mimic the corporate settings. Such scaffolding is specified in terms of a Domain Specific Language (DSL). The DSL engine is then able to turn the DSL expression into a MediaWiki installation which is ready to be populated but now, along the company settings.

40|$|Wikis are main exponents of {{collaborative}} development by user communities. This community may be created around the wiki itself (e. g., community of con-tributors in Wikipedia) or already exist (e. g., company employees in corporate wikis). In the latter case, the wiki is not created {{in a vacuum}} {{but as part of}} the information ecosystem of the hosting organization. As any other Information System resource, wiki success highly depends on the interplay of technology, work practice and the organization. Thus, wiki contributions should be framed along the concerns already in use in the hosting organization in terms of glos-saries, schedules, policies, <b>organigrams</b> and the like. The question is then, how can corporate strategies permeate wiki construction while preserving wiki open-ness and accessibility? We advocate for the use of Wiki Scaffoldings, i. e., a wiki installation that is provided at the onset to mimic these corporate con-cerns: categories, users, templates, articles initialized with boilerplate text, are all introduced in the wiki before any contribution is made. To retain wikis' friendliness and engage layman participation, we propose scaffoldings to be de-scribed as mind maps. Mind maps are next exported as wiki installations. We show the feasibility of the approach introducing a Wiki Scaffolding Language (WSL). WSL is realized as a plugin for FreeMind, a popular tool for mind map-ping. Finally, we validate the expressiveness of WSL in four case studies. WSL is available for download...|$|R
40|$|Directionality is {{a crucial}} {{ingredient}} in many complex networks in which information, energy or influence are transmitted. In such directed networks, analysing flows (and not only the strength of connections) is crucial to reveal important features of the network that might go undetected if the orientation of connections is ignored. We showcase here a flow-based approach for community detection in networks through {{the study of the}} network of the most influential Twitter users during the 2011 riots in England. Firstly, we use directed Markov Stability to extract descriptions of the network at different levels of coarseness in terms of interest communities, i. e., groups of nodes within which flows of information are contained and reinforced. Such interest communities reveal user groupings according to location, profession, employer, and topic. The study of flows also allows us to generate an interest distance, which affords a personalised view of the attention in the network as viewed {{from the vantage point of}} any given user. Secondly, we analyse the profiles of incoming and outgoing long-range flows with a combined approach of role-based similarity and the novel relaxed minimum spanning tree algorithm to reveal that the users in the network can be classified into five roles. These flow roles go beyond the standard leader/follower dichotomy and differ from classifications based on regular/structural equivalence. We then show that the interest communities fall into distinct informational <b>organigrams</b> characterised by a different mix of user roles reflecting the quality of dialogue within them. Our generic framework can be used to provide insight into how flows are generated, distributed, preserved and consumed in directed networks. Comment: 32 pages, 14 figures.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} {{automating}} {{the drawing of}} subway maps. There are two features of schematic subway maps that make them different from drawings of other networks such as flow charts or <b>organigrams.</b> First, most schematic subway maps use not only horizontal and vertical lines, but also diagonals. This gives more flexibility in the layout process, but it also makes the problem provably hard. Second, a subway map represents a network whose components have geographic locations that are roughly known to the users of such a map. This knowledge must be respected during {{the search for a}} clear layout of the network. For the sake of visual clarity the underlying geography may be distorted, but it must not be given up, otherwise map users will be hopelessly confused. In this paper we first give a rather generally accepted list of rules that should be adhered to by a good subway map. Next we survey three recent methods for drawing subway maps, analyze their performance with respect to the above rules, and compare the resulting maps among each other and to official subway maps drawn by graphic designers. We then focus on one of the methods, which is based on mixed-integer linear programming, a widely-used global optimization technique. This method guarantees to find a drawing that fulfills a subset of the above-mentioned rules (if such a drawing exists) and optimizes a weighted sum of costs that correspond to the remaining rules. The method can draw even large subway networks such as the London Underground in an aesthetically pleasing manner, similar to maps made by professional graphic designers. If station labels are included in the optimization process, so far only mediumsize networks can be drawn. Finally we give evidence why drawing good subway maps is difficult (even without labels) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Enterprises have {{accumulated}} both structured and unstructured data steadily as computing resources improve. However, {{previous research on}} enter-prise data mining often treats these two kinds of data independently and omits mutual benefits. We explore the approach to incorporate a common type of struc-tured data (i. e. <b>organigram)</b> into generative topic model. Our approach, the Par-tially Observed Topic model (POT), not only considers the unstructured words, but also {{takes into account the}} structured information in its generation process. By integrating the structured data implicitly, the mixed topics over document are par-tially observed during the Gibbs sampling procedure. This allows POT to learn topic pertinently and directionally, which makes it easy tuning and suitable for end-use application. We evaluate our proposed new model on a real-world dataset and show the result of improved expressiveness over traditional LDA. In the task of document classification, POT also demonstrates more discriminative power than LDA...|$|E

40|$|On the {{occasion}} of a world congress in 1910 in Brussels Paul Otlet, Henri La Fontaine and Cyrille Van Overbergh founded the Union of International Associations (UIA), an umbrella organization of international non-governmental and intergovernmental organizations. The UIA posed {{the problem of the}} coordination of and cooperation between these international organizations. Paul Otlet described the organizational principle of international organizations in direct opposition to that of the nation-states: whereas the nation-states represented a group of interests according to a territorial and ethnic basis, the international organizations represented the interests of professional, economic and scientific groups. The great task of the future was, according to Otlet, to realize a world constitution between the power of the nation-states and of the international organizations. A new balance was to be found between the administration of the territory within the national bounderies and the administration of the emerging international networks that transcended these boundaries. In several schemas and <b>organigrams,</b> Otlet expressed how he envisioned a confederative structure of social international relations, and how the national and international structures of social organizations could be brought in conformity with one another. The most well known schema of Otlet is that of a network of international organizations, centralized around a coordinating international centre. But besides this schema, other less known schemas drawn by Otlet, give us insight in his ‘international sociology’. In these schemas, society is structured as a ‘body’ or as ‘a topology’ of functions. These schemas remind of the conception of the ‘hyperorganism’ of Herbert Spencer, but a closer study reveals a more diverse ramification of Otlet’s sociology. Starting from these schemas, this paper will try to retrace Otlet’s sociological conception of the UAI. His conception will be compared to other sociological models proposed by scientists and sociologists with whose ideas Otlet was acquainted: Ernest Solvay, René Worms, Hector Denis, Guillaume De Greef, Henri Fayol, Wilhelm Ostwald, H. G Wells, and Jacques Novicow...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} is basically {{about how the}} authors, co-teaching a social work class on “political, social and judicial systems” developed a concept of scaling-reflexive professionalism to be taught in scaling-reflexive teaching. Scaling-reflexive professionalism implies at least three aspects. Firstly, {{it refers to the}} professionals’ ability of questioning what could be termed as collectively shared understandings of how professionals have to act on their ‘clients’ with regard to the organisation and the field they are working in. Secondly, it means that professionals have to be sensible to the ongoing scaling work in organisations and fields, i. e. concurrent enactment by different people in different places – governance units or arenas, front- or border-line services – of partially conflicting, emotionally conglutinated and more or less materially cemented ideas/beliefs. Thirdly, it implies that professionals are able, in interaction with persons that are organisationally scaled as ‘clients’, to ‘control’ their own professional scales {{in order to understand the}} scales deployed by the latter. From here, the teaching challenge turns out to be twofold. On the one hand, theoretical knowledge - as scales - has to be anchored in the students’ stock of experience, and on the other, students have to acquire competence in making use of it. Therefore, scaling-reflexivity has to be taught in scaling-reflexive interactions. In a first step, we as teachers need to discover a bigger range of our students’ scaling universes, and we have to create situations of interaction with our own universes. In a second step, we need to confront the scales of administrators, professionals and clients in social service organisations with their own and those of their teachers through field research - mainly interviews with these different actors. Law, technologies and <b>organigrams</b> and so on progressively then begin to appear in their characteristic as conventions. Students would discover them as such and begin to analyse professional scopes of intervention for the well-being of their clients...|$|R
40|$|Technology Enhanced Learning Environments (TELE) theme, in Higher Education Institutions (HEI), is a {{hot topic}} in {{research}} {{and it has been}} taken into consideration by the policies of several international organizations and countries. Several evaluation models have been proposed that cover different dimensions of TELE, and the scale of analysis of these models ranges from: i) an organizational, Cartesian, systemic and holistic view; ii) a micro view, in which certain environmental elements are considered (eg material / content, student assessment, tutoring). The HEI are complex organizations with <b>organigrams</b> with several levels of decision and range of action (university, schools/colleges, departments, courses, [...] ). These structures/agents are accountable and act in different levels of TELE ranging from the holistic view, which belongs to the hierarchically superior structures, to the smaller elements of the system, namely each department or course. In this chapter, we do a literature review on how learning organizations are structured and learn by focusing our analysis on the advantages which result in meeting the challenges of this globalized world, where the only constant is change. We also intend to review what has been proposed by examining some of the most significant assessment models of TELE in use today. This analysis will be achieved by positioning these models in a matrix, built on the dimensions proposed by the "E-learning quality - ELQ" model developed by the Swedish National Agency for Higher Education. The ELQ model considers ten dimensions (1. Material/content, 2. Structure/virtual environment, 3. Communication, cooperation and interactivity, 4. Student assessment, 5. Flexibility and adaptability, 6. Support: student and staff 7. Staff qualifications and experience, 8. Vision and institutional leadership, 9. Resource allocation, 10. The holistic and process aspect). These dimensions were identified through the analysis of i) policies, projects and working networks developed by several European organizations, ii) policies of governmental agencies and national organizations dedicated to quality assurance in higher education, especially in e-learning, iii) published scientific articles. It is expected that the matrix will reflect a systemic view, where the different evaluation models are contextualized in the dimensions proposed by the ELQ and the links between the models of holistic view and those focusing on smaller elements of the process teaching and learning will be pointed out. Although it is true that to effectively evaluate the global policies of TELE, or each one of their dimensions, it is not enough that the HIE import and apply evaluation models, as it is also essential that these organizations develop and adapt their own working methods and ensure their internal competence. On the other hand, it is equally true that the models are important references that enable each HIE to build and adapt their own assessment mechanisms. The positioning of the different models of evaluation in a matrix, which runs along the critical dimensions of TELE present in the ELQ, with a spectrum analysis between the micro and the macro-scale can be an important tool for the organizations enabling them to define their own evaluation models, identifying who evaluates, what is evaluated and in what context...|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} new approach {{differs from the}} traditional database modeling methods. The document-centric modeling should have a strong correlation with the enterprise architecture, more exactly to the Business Processes.

The document model should reflect the evolution of documents, the changes, the events, the stimulus–response patterns in line with the business processes. The changes that affect the identifiable data contained in documents should be tracked, i.e., creating, modifying new data elements, setting up new relationship, e.g., making use of precedence analyses [6]. The chain of course can be monitored through the actors and their manipulation of identifiable data elements within documents.

Two types of organizational knowledge are distinguished: explicit and implicit- or tacit- knowledge. Explicit knowledge is well known and can be documented in many forms (e. g. paper or electronic manuals, web documents, e-mail, intelligent reasoning systems), and many systems already exist that aim or claim to manage this knowledge.

Most of the time, the organization is not even aware of the types of tacit knowledge that exist within its boundaries. A simple <b>organigram</b> will no longer do.

40|$|Abstract: Health care demands have {{increased}} dramatically in recent decades. With {{the introduction of}} {{major changes in the}} management of health problems, health care costs have spiralled. Today, in the interests of cost control, medicine is geared towards outpatient care whenever possible. In this process, the medical community has been obliged to adapt its traditional criteria to the dictates of national economies. Today the criteria for the organization and evaluation of the health services are based on the concepts of efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency. This has led to {{the emergence of a new}} discipline for the design and evaluation of medical service production, known as servuction, an amalgam of “service ” and “production”. The <b>organigram</b> of a new health product should include the problems the program faces and the steps proposed to overcome these problems. The concept of evaluation can be divided into two categories: administrative evaluation, and evaluative research. Avedis Donabedian was one of the founders of evaluative research, based on an easy-to-remember triad: structure-process-results. In the final evaluation of a new health care model, the innovations it provides must be considered. In this article we describe the stages involved in the design of a new health product and correlate them with the types of evaluation that should be applied at each point in the process. Our discussion addresses general aspects of servuction, but also focuses on the design of a particular service, created to care for patients with severe COPD...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the importance of}} the actions to be taken before the project planning phases begin. The approach taken stems from the production planning paradigm, with emphasis on the product, rather than on the process. It is argued that a complete part list or product breakdown structure (PBS) is the absolute prerequisite for the design of a successful work breakdown structure (WBS) for a project. This process requires the definition of the design and configuration disciplines during the engineering phase. These critical issues of concurrent engineering and product development are also emphasized in the paper. The WBS is, in turn, needed to establish a suitable organizational breakdown structure (OBS or <b>organigram)</b> for the project. Finally, the assembly sequence and the related assembly breakdown structure (ABS) of the end product is required before commencing the project planning phase, which provides the schedules, resource allocation, progress control, and the like for the project management. Detailed definition of the product enables the definition of the work packages within the WBS, which combined with the installation information provide the means to structure the layout for the project organization. The result of the entire process, that begins with the product definition phase and ends with the completion of the planning phase, is called the project management plan. The procedure described in the paper will be used to design the project management plan for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a ten-year "ordeal" commencing {{at the beginning of the}} 1995, at CER...|$|E

40|$|Venice Biennial, 2010 Hungarian Pavilion Sketching {{helps me}} to {{understand}} and navigate between the different scales. For example, when sketching the city I try to redefine the systems of the existing historical structures. Sketching {{is also a good}} way to define a place without a form. I consider architecture as a mixture of drawing, thinking and writing. In my work I write a lot about architecture. In one of my jobs the first step was to explore how to define the project literally, with words and emotions, as Aldo Rossi used to do. He was as much interested in writing as in building. After I’ve completed this phase I try to think about the building. I used to start planning by doing a lot of sketches first. Now it’s slightly different. We first prepare the program, then we write and explore the conditions around us {{in order to understand the}} client. After this we try to realize the <b>organigram</b> of the functions, making a scheme of the dimensions and connections. Then we start doing sketches of the volume, designing it on a computer and preparing other sketches to correct the computer drawings, all this to better understand what we are doing. The final stage is computer detailing. Designing by hand is much “warmer”, it has a more human touch compared to designing by autocad. I don’t know what other people think of sketching and drawing. I think it’s important but maybe it’s because of the generation I belong to. My students don’t use it. I don’t think that the quality of a sketch should be important since what's important is the idea in the hand, and you have to be able to express certain architectural thoughts with your hands. Nobody uses sketch paper, pens, or pencils from the younger generation. They just use primitive prints of cad drawings so they fail to gain an understanding of the scale, nor of the meaning of a line. They use the same computer elements for every drawing, and that destroys the idea of architecture. I think we should put some thought in a project before doing anything. Sketching or writing is a way of thinking and understanding. Sketching, renderings and making models as simultaneously used techniques help you to understand proportions. Using just renderings can lead to a lot of mistakes. To sketch something well is to think about what is beyond building – not just in the sense of Aaron Betsky – but about what happened before the project was conceived. You need to consider what the connection is between your thoughts and your hand… Sketching answers the question of what exactly you want to do on an empty white sheet of paper...|$|E
40|$|India?s new and contested {{status as}} a nuclear power, the scale of her arms purchases, her {{investment}} in missile technology and the huge deployment of ground troops {{on the western front}} against Pakistan are issues of immediate concern to her South Asian neighbours. Since tension feeds on tension, war in Afghanistan, terrorist attacks in Kolkata, Delhi, Jammu and Srinagar, mounting tension between India and Pakistan over the issue of cross-border terrorism in Kashmir and the recent threat by General Pervez Musharraf to consider the first strike option as part of Pakistan?s strategic response to Indian mobilisation have contributed to the seriousness of the situation. The probability of the regional conflict escalating into large scale nuclear war, or weapons of mass destruction finding their way into the hands of non-state actors, have drawn world attention to South Asia, which has had visits in quick succession by political leaders and military delegations from the United States, UK, Germany, France, China and Russia. The paper, focused on India?s capacities, perceptions and institutional arrangements for the management of security, seeks to evaluate the significance of her {{status as a}}n ?emerging? power for the security environment in Asia, and its implication for the international system. It analyses the main objective both empirically, and theoretically. The empirical aspect concerns the measurement of India?s economic and military resources according to the conventional indicators of power. These facts, based on experts? accounts, are supplemented by political and institutional factors which are significant for the estimation of the power of a country. In addition, the analysis seeks to juxtapose the views of observers and actors, and locate the strategic perception of the Indian voter, an important factor in her political landscape in view of her active democratic process. These factors of contemporary politics are to be seen in the larger context of India?s political and security culture, history, the structure of the political system. The issue of contextualisation needs to be understood in terms of its methodological implication at the outset, because, while all states are members of the international system, the use to which they put international politics varies from one context to another. Western nation states, products of a long process of nation building, industrialisation and state-formation, seek the promotion of national interest through their strategic initiatives. Post-colonial state-nations, engaged in the process of nation-creation, are more complex in their rhetoric. For these actors, international politics, in addition to being used as an instrument of national interest, also plays a symbolic role in the building of a national profile. The paper seeks to combine both the material and symbolic aspects of Indian policy in the concept of a security doctrine, one that can bring potential power into an effective focus, in the absence of which mere appurtenances of power like guns and ships are just that and not much more. Since the stability of the doctrine, in addition to its coherence is an important parameter of the significance of Indian power, the paper also takes into account the problems of implementation as well. Though there is considerable force to the argument that South Asian security is crucially contingent on the India-China-Pakistan triangle, India remains the biggest power in South Asia, and her significance, in terms of how India sees herself and how others see her, is a key consideration for regional politics. The need for a sophisticated methodological analysis arises paradoxically from the fact that India is a democratic state and an open society, both of which give a false sense of visibility to India?s security profile. Foreign observers, depending on their own national origin and the context, place their bets on predictions of India?s next move either as the ?regional bully? or the ?regional push-over?, and India, Janus-like, often proves both speculations to be right, appearing in the process to be either mystical-moral, or utterly devoid of principle or doctrine. The paper is in three parts. The first examines the state of play by ranking India with reference to her strategic resource endowments. The second part examines India?s strategic doctrine and the <b>organigram</b> of security, and evaluates her potential power in the light of her doctrine. The third part makes a prognosis of the challenging path ahead for India with reference to the unsolved problems concerning her national security. The conclusion reconsiders the main issue posed in the introduction {{in the light of the}} analysis undertaken here...|$|E
