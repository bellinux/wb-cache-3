50|$|Aqueous {{minerals}} {{are sensitive}} {{indicators of the}} type of environment that existed when the minerals formed. The ease with which aqueous reactions occur (see Gibbs free energy) depends on the pressure, temperature, and on the concentrations of the gaseous and soluble species involved.

Phyllosilicates usually form in water of neutral to high pH (alkaline). Eh is a measure is the oxidation state of an aqueous system. Together Eh and pH indicate the types of minerals that are thermodynamically most likely to form from a given set of aqueous components. Thus, past environmental conditions on Mars, including those conducive to life, can be inferred from the types of minerals present in the rocks.|$|E

The microprofiles were measured using a motorized microprofiling system equipped with microsensors. The leaf age of the macrophyte and periphyton exerted significant effects on the microprofiles of O 2, pH, and <b>oxidation-reduction</b> <b>potential.</b> O 2 concentration and pH increased whereas the <b>oxidation-reduction</b> <b>potential</b> decreased with decreasing distance to the stem/leaf surface. The fluctuation amplitudes of O 2, pH, and <b>oxidation-reduction</b> <b>potential</b> were {{the largest in the}} microprofiles of mature leaves and the lowest in senescent leaves. The periphyton increased the thickness of the broad diffusive boundary layer and fluctuation amplitudes of O 2, pH, and <b>oxidation-reduction</b> <b>potential.</b> When the periphyton was removed, the thickness of the broad diffusive boundary layer in the microprofiles of stems, senescent leaves, and mature leaves reduced by 29. 0 %, 49. 72 %, and 70. 34 %, and the O 2, pH, and <b>oxidation-reduction</b> <b>potential</b> fluctuation amplitudes also declined accordingly. Our results suggest that a thick periphyton exerted negative effects on the growth of macrophytes by providing extensive shading and creating a barrier that hindered the transport of dissolved substances such as O 2, and led to premature decline in macrophytes in the eutrophic Taihu Lake.

40|$|The {{solution}} {{chemistry of}} the lower oxidation states of ruthenium has attracted considerable attention in recent years from an applied viewpoint, but remains incompletely understood as far as basic considerations are concerned. Much of the contradictory in-formation in the literature {{is a result of}} tendencies to oversimplify the exceedingly complex processes which ruthenium com-pounds can undergo in aqueous media. It {{is becoming more and more}} apparent that such phenomena as oxidation-reduction, poly-rnerisation and cornplexation must be taken into account when dealing with ruthenium species in solution, even for seemingly simple overall processes. The older literature on ruthenium com-pounds is summarised by Mellor (I) and also by Sidgewick (2). The most recent general review in this field seems to be the excellent comprehensive summary of DeFord (3), who has given a critical discussion of the literature up to 1948. Much important work has been reported since 1948, however, because of the interest in ruthenium as a long-lived product of fission wastes. Reduction Potentials Despite repeated efforts to establish reliable information on the <b>oxidation-reduction</b> <b>potentials</b> {{of the lower}} oxidation states of ruthenium, considerable confusion and am-biguity still exist in the literature on this aspect of ruthenium chemistry. According to DeFord (3), the lack of reproducible experi-mental data on <b>oxidation-reduction</b> <b>potentials</b> is due to the lack of rapid, reversible reactions suitable for this type of measurement.
