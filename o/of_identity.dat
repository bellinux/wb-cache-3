40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} inductive, {{positional}} and Σ−compositions of terms {{in order to}} describe some varieties defined by such compositions. In algebra, equational logic, theoretical computer science, etc. the composition of terms is defined as replacements of some variables by external terms. We consider the positional composition of terms as a tool, which allows us to extend the derivation rules in formal deduction <b>of</b> <b>identities.</b> Cases when closure operators of the sets <b>of</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> a given type are fully invariant congruences are investigated. The concept of essential variables and essential positions of terms {{with respect to a}} set <b>of</b> <b>identities</b> is a key step in the simplification of the process of formal deduction. TSR-closure of the sets <b>of</b> <b>identities</b> is obtained by applying inductive and positional term composition in deduction <b>of</b> <b>identities.</b> Σ−composition <b>of</b> terms is defined as replacement between Σ-equal terms. This composition induces ΣR−deductively closed sets <b>of</b> <b>identities.</b> In analogy to balanced identities we introduce and investigate Σ−balanced identities for a given set Σ <b>of</b> <b>identities...</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{between the}} time Scott {{released}} Alien in 1979 {{and returned to the}} franchise with Prometheus in 2012, he directed another notable science fiction film concerning artificial intelligence, Blade Runner, in 1982. Contrary to the white-blooded androids of Alien that emulate emotions and recognize a disconnect with humanity, Blade Runner features the replicants- enhanced biorobotic humanoids that may only be identified by their lacking emotions. In order to maintain control, the replicants' human creators install false memories that detail entire lives that give them a sense <b>of</b> <b>identity.</b> Blade Runner, a largely influential film, has prompted a slew of philosophical questions concerning artificial intelligence and whether or not an android could truly be considered alive. The film specifically questions whether thoughts, a sense <b>of</b> <b>identity,</b> emotions and consciousness in general, may be something genuine when applied to artificial intelligence. Due to David identifying himself as a living entity - similar to the replicants - film critics in 2012 would come not to only question if Prometheus was a direct prequel to Alien, but if the film had a relation to Blade Runner.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we want to}} give an {{explicit}} description <b>of</b> <b>identities</b> satisfied by matrices n × n over a field k of characteristic 0, {{in order to be able}} to compute with formal matrices (“forgetting” their representations with coefficients). We introduce a universal free algebra, where all formal manipulations are made. Using classical properties <b>of</b> <b>identities</b> in an algebra with trace, we reduce our problem to the study <b>of</b> <b>identities</b> among multilinear traces. These are closely linked with the action of the algebra of the symmetric group k[Sm] on the mth tensor product of E = Kn. By proving a theorem about the kernel of this action and its effective version, we can decompose all <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> matrices in {{an explicit}} way as linear combinations, substitutions, products or traces of the well-known Cayley-Hamilton identity. This leads to an algorithm of reduction to a canonical form, modulo the ideal <b>of</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> matrices, in the free algebra. Moreover, this set <b>of</b> <b>identities</b> is in fact a prime ideal and a natural extension of the quotient by this ideal gives us a skew field, which is also the fraction ring of the algebra of generic matrices...|$|R

One interpretation suggests that her three eyes represent the sun, the moon, and fire while another links the third eye to transcendental knowledge.
