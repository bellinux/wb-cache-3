One of the underlying reasons might be the lack of knowledge of the <b>written</b> <b>procedure.</b> Indeed, we found that among ICUs self-reporting a protocol for sedation management, approximately 20 % of the physicians were unaware of it. Hence, the presence of <b>written</b> <b>procedures</b> does not mean that there is an ICU culture promoting the benefits of <b>written</b> <b>procedures</b> to reduce practice variation within participating ICUs.

PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred and sixty French ICUs were presented the questionnaire in September 2007. RESULTS: Surveys were received from 228 (60. 6 %) ICUs. Midazolam was used in more than 50 % of the patients in 79. 2 % of the ICUs and propofol in 22. 2 % of the ICUs. Sufentanil was {{the most frequently used}} morphinic. A sedation-scale was used in 68. 8 % of the units (80. 3 % Ramsay score). Sedation was assessed at least every 4 hours in 61 % of ICUs. A pain-scale was used in 88. 9 % of the ICUs, but only 12. 5 % in the non-communicant patients. A <b>written</b> <b>procedure</b> was used in 29. 4 % of the units only. In multivariate analysis, use in the ICU of a <b>written</b> <b>procedure</b> for the early management of patients with septic shock and/or intensive insulin therapy was the single variable significantly associated with presence of a <b>written</b> <b>procedure</b> for sedation and analgesia (respectively OR 4. 37; p< 0. 0001 and OR 5. 64; p= 0. 032). CONCLUSION: Although more than two-third of the responding ICUs reported the use of sedation-and-pain-scales, frequency of assessment was low, and objective assessment of pain in the non-communicating patients was extremely uncommon. Similarly, the use of <b>written</b> <b>procedure</b> was low. The use of sedation-analgesia <b>written</b> <b>procedure</b> in an ICU seems strongly influenced by a more global involvement of the ICU in the protocolisation of complex care.
