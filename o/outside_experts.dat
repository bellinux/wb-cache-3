Regardless, the entire plant has undergone intense sanitation, which began August 21. About 80 workers {{were involved in the}} cleanup, with additional <b>outside</b> <b>experts</b> and microbiologists supervising the operation. They used peroxyacetic acid, quaternary ammonium compound, isopropyl alcohol, refrigeration gel and a granular compound to disinfect the parts of the apparatuses. About 600 employees were to attend a four-hour training session on Listeria and on cleanliness, and about 250 employees were laid off while the plant was being cleaned.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} a panel of <b>outside</b> <b>experts</b> determined that Smith's death was caused by a combination of three factors: the failure of the electronic functions of his Inspiration closed circuit rebreather (CCR) due to hydrodynamic forces from the hydraulic impact hammer being used nearby, Smith's inattention to his handset and head up displays, and the other two divers allowing Smith to return to Aquarius alone. The investigation concluded that due to these issues Smith became unconscious from hypoxia and drowned when the mouthpiece came out of his mouth. Saturation and CCR diving at Aquarius were suspended in the wake of Smith's death, but the review board recommended that they be resumed with the implementation of additional safety measures.|$|E
25|$|The {{series has}} also {{attracted}} some criticism from other pawnbrokers, who while conceding its entertainment value, {{claim that the}} series' focus on the extravagant vintage items brought into the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop are not typical of the average pawn shop, whose business is predicated on individuals on fixed income who bring in conventional objects {{in order to pay}} their bills, such as electronics, tools and jewelry. Corey Grigson and Charles Brown, who own a shop called Pawn Stars, estimate that their average loan to a customer is between $50 and $100.

These damages were collectively known as the Alabama Claims. These ships had inflicted tremendous damage to U.S. merchant ships during the Civil War and Washington wanted the British to pay heavy damages, perhaps including turning over Canada.|$|E
500|$|From February to May 1996, the House National Security Committee held {{hearings}} on the ballistic missile threat, and in a final report recommended that two reviews be created: one to investigate the NIE itself, and another to complete a new investigation of the ballistic missile threat. [...] This process was also highly politicized, and the ranking Democrat on the committee, California Congressman Ronald Dellums, accused it of relying far too heavily on <b>outside</b> <b>experts.</b> [...] Many of the witnesses called before the committee were in fact strong proponents of missile defense. [...] The first review was conducted by former Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and future Defense Secretary Robert Gates. [...] He concluded that while there was evidence of faulty methodology in the NIE, there was no political bias in its conclusions. This conclusion again angered the missile defense supporters who had counted on this review to further their arguments.|$|E

500|$|Sesame Street head writer Norman Stiles {{was chosen}} to write the {{segments}} about Mr. Hooper's death. [...] The episode focused on {{the life cycle of}} birth and death by also mentioning the birth of a baby, and by remembering Mr. Hooper. [...] Stiles said, [...] "We decided to say that while Mr. Hooper was not here anymore, we will always have that part of him that lives within the heart, that we have our love and that it will always stay". [...] Stiles wanted to convey that expressing grief for someone who had died was difficult for both adults and children. [...] Instead of providing an explanation, the adults of Sesame Street tell Mr. Hooper's friend Big Bird, when he asked why Mr. Hooper had died, that there was no real reason, that it happened, as Gordon tells Big Bird, [...] "Just because". [...] The show's <b>outside</b> <b>experts</b> advised Stiles and the producers to remove the line because they were concerned that an open-ended explanation would not be enough for children, but Stiles kept the line because it was an acknowledgement, as Gikow stated, that there is never a good explanation about why people die.|$|E

[...] Trenchard began work on 18 January and during his first month at the Air Ministry, he clashed with Rothermere over several issues. [...] First, Rothermere's tendency to disregard his professional advisors in favour of <b>outside</b> <b>experts</b> irritated Trenchard. Secondly, Rothermere insisted that Trenchard claim as many men for the RAF as possible even if they might be better employed in the other services. [...] Finally and most significantly, they disagreed over proper future use of air power which Trenchard judged as being vital in preventing {{a repeat of the}} strategic stalemate which had occurred along the Western Front. [...] Also during this time Trenchard resisted pressure from several press barons to support an [...] "air warfare scheme" [...] which would have seen the British armies withdrawn from France and the defeat of Germany entrusted to the RAF. [...] Despite the arguments and his differences with Rothermere, Trenchard was able to put in place planning for the merger of the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service. [...] However, as the weeks went on, Trenchard and Rothermere became increasingly estranged and a low point was reached in mid-March when Trenchard discovered that Rothermere had promised the Navy 4000 aircraft for anti-submarine duties. [...] He accorded the highest priority to air operations on the Western Front: there were fewer than 400 spare aircraft in Great Britain. [...] On 18 March, Trenchard and Rothermere exchanged letters, Trenchard expressing his dissatisfaction and Rothermere curtly replying. [...] The following day Trenchard sent Rothermere a letter of resignation and although Rothermere called for Trenchard and asked him to remain, Trenchard only agreed to defer the date until after 1 April when the Royal Air Force would officially come into being.|$|E
