40|$|Thesis (M. Development and Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. In the {{accomplishment}} of good governance South African municipalities need to develop measurable objectives related to performance measures and targets that capture strategically important aspects of performance. This allows performance to be easily monitored and aligned with municipal Integrated Development Plans (IDPs). Performance information {{should be used in}} conjunction with strategic planning, budgeting, policy analysis and evaluations, <b>organisational</b> <b>reviews</b> and performance appraisals for the managers. This is necessary in order to improve performance and for assuring the public that they are receiving value for money. A Performance Management System (PMS) is the principal management mechanism intended to determine outcomes and impact of municipal service delivery on the communities they are commissioned by legislation to service. The PMS measures should always be relevant, meaningful and informative to political and administrative decision-makers. The data gathered from the PMS should be presented in a balanced, comprehensive and credible manner. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyse the challenges that influence the implementation of the local government PMS in the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District Municipality.

40|$|It {{is argued}} {{in this chapter}} {{that we live in}} the {{knowledge}} economy, a term coined by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development in a report entitled The Knowledge Based Economy (1996). According to this report, the economy has become a hierarchy of networks fuelled by the rapid rate of change in all aspects of life, including learning, which in turn has compressed the world, encouraging the merging of the world 2 ̆ 7 s economic and cultural systems. Contemporary economic and social contexts coupled with competing perspectives on the "future" place significant demands upon educators and educational leaders who are increasingly expected to act in futures-oriented ways whilst also remaining true to the professional standards of their present environments (Faculty of Education and Creative Arts, 2003). In response to these issues and internal <b>organisational</b> <b>reviews</b> of Central Queensland University, the revision and renewal of a number of degrees currently being offered by the Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Education have become increasingly necessary.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} management {{decision making}} at the ward level in hospitals especially by ward sisters, {{and the effectiveness}} of the intervention of a decision support system. Nursing practice theories were related to organisation and management theories in order to conceptualise a decision making framework for nurse manpower planning and deployment at the ward level. Decision and systems theories were explored to understand the concepts of decision making and the realities of power in an organisation. In essence, the hypothesis was concerned with changes in patterns of decision making that could occur with the intervention of a decision support system and that the degree of change would be governed by a set of `difficulty' factors within wards in a hospital. During the course of the study, a classification of ward management decision making was created, together with the development and validation of measuring instruments to test the research hypothesis. The decision support system used was rigorously evaluated to test whether benefits did accrue from its implementation. Quantitative results from sample wards together with qualitative information collected, were used to test this hypothesis and the outcomes postulated were supported by these findings. The main conclusion from this research is that a more rational approach to management decision making is feasible, using information from a decision support system. However, wards and ward sisters that need the most assistance, where the `difficulty' factors in the organisation are highest, benefit the least from this type of system. <b>Organisational</b> <b>reviews</b> are needed on these identified wards, involving managers and doctors, to reduce the levels of un-coordinated activities and disruption...|$|R

40|$|The {{significance}} of the academic library in the university campus can be manifest {{in a variety of}} ways – through the physical location, the housing of significant collections, the variety of services and as a cultural hub and active partner in university strategy. The idea of the academic library as the ‘centre for everything’, while having obvious strategic attractions, also brings with it serious hazards which may ultimately be counterproductive to core values. In recent years Maynooth University (MU) Library has actively worked to ensure that its position as a centre for first-class collections and services has been enhanced and its role has been perceived to be more nuanced – acting as a nexus for a myriad of activities on campus.

This paper researches, discusses and assesses whether or not TARGETconnect provides a return on investment for the Careers and Employability Service at the University of Chichester and therefore justifies future investment in TARGETconnect. The <b>organisational</b> <b>review</b> highlighted a key obstacle in investing in TARGETconnect for future years was the current incompatibility the website has with mobile technology, with a growing demand for accessibility on both desktop and mobile formats. However, the literature review also provided optimism for a return on the investment with Imperial College London using TARGETconnect to generate revenue via the facilitation of advertisements from external companies to students at the University. Following the <b>organisational</b> <b>review,</b> data collection was undertaken with current University of Chichester (UoC) TARGETconnect users using questionnaires, a focus group, an options appraisal and an interview. The research identified the profile of active student users to be female undergraduates, who used TARGETconnect to search for employment opportunities. Profiling active users from external organisations found the majority originated from a company that had been established for more than 10 years and were looking to advertise opportunities to graduates. The research found TARGETconnect to have many benefits to all stakeholders, providing students with a quick and convenient platform to access employment advertisements, whilst offering a facility for external businesses to promote opportunities to students. Moreover, TARGETconnect was also found to assist the Careers and Employability Service of the UoC, decreasing staff administration time on tasks, whilst also providing a database to save notes from student appointments for future use. The research also identified that the barriers hindering stakeholders’ use of TARGETconnect were the lack of guidance as to how to effectively use the website, users did not find the website easily accessible and TARGETconnect is not compatible with mobile technology. This led to the recommendation of system improvements that would lead to TARGETconnect offering better value to justify future investment. With regards to charging external employers to engage with TARGETconnect in order to fund the system and generate revenue for the Careers and Employability Service at the University of Chichester, the research indicated that the majority of employers would not be willing to pay. Of those that would be willing to pay, statistical evidence would be required to indicate whether their advertisement was effective and worth repeating in the future. The paper recommends a review of the marketing of TARGETconnect, whilst also addressing the issues of accessibility and compatibility with mobile technology. It is predicted this will lead to increased usage of the website, whilst also encouraging more registrations, increasing the value of the service to its stakeholders. In addition, it is also recommended the service has a tiered pricing option to avoid losing active users who do not want to pay for TARGETconnect, whilst improving the effectiveness of advertising opportunities through TARGETconnect for the companies that {{are willing to pay for}} additional promotions...|$|E

40|$|The call to utilise {{participation}} in river research and management has grown steadily {{over the last}} few decades and features in many policy guidelines (most notably the Water Framework Directive). However, with little detailed guidance on the appropriate levels of participation, and on the appropriate participants, river management organisations are left to determine these for themselves, within given temporal and financial restrictions. Consequently, participation often comes second to meeting the environmental goals of the organisation. It is argued here that participation need not necessarily be viewed as an ‘add-on’, but that when used effectively, it can be beneficial both to the environment and the communities involved. Furthermore, within any aspect of river research (academic or managerial), participation of those who live daily with the river can enhance process understandings and lead to context specific research. This study, therefore, aimed to identify and evaluate innovative approaches to river research and management which place a focus on the integration of a diverse range of knowledges, in an effort to move beyond the traditional scientific approaches, focusing on the acclaimed benefits of high-level participation and knowledge co-production, in a range of situations. The two-step approach, involving a review of organisational practice and a local case study, was both interdisciplinary and participatory. The methodological approach allowed the <b>Organisational</b> <b>Review</b> step to provide context for the wider project, while the case study focused on the development of research objectives with the community who would be affected by their outcomes. The integration and deliberation of both scientific and experiential knowledge led to a process of knowledge co-production among the participants. The results of the participatory investigation into the impacts of weir restoration (on the River Derwent in County Durham/Northumberland) suggested that changing the profile of the weir would cause some localised, small scale changes to hydraulic aspects such as flow level upstream of the weir, but that flow rate and sediment transport would be relatively unaffected. The <b>Organisational</b> <b>Review</b> concluded that factors such as scale, resources, motivations and attitudes strongly influenced the uptake and success of participatory processes. Analysis of the participatory approach led to the conclusion that selection of a single participatory approach may be unsuitable in practical situations due to the changing nature of projects, and that a reflexive approach is likely to increase the success of participation. Universal application of high-level participation is recommended only with caution and the context of each individual project should be carefully considered before opting for the approach. Existing environmental controversies can be utilised to facilitate co-production of knowledge through a high-level participatory approach. While caution and contextual consideration are advised, high-level participation can offer a number of benefits, including the co-production of a context-specific knowledge, relevant research questions, and social learning for all involved. The results showed that experiential knowledge can be highly valuable in researching and managing rivers at a range of scales. ...|$|E

This study builds on formative qualitative research, conducted in the Moreland/Hume local government areas of Melbourne, Victoria 2006 – 2009, in response to community concerns for oral health of children from refugee and migrant backgrounds. Development of the community-based intervention described here extends the partnership approach to cogeneration of contemporary evidence with continued and meaningful involvement of investigators, community, cultural and government partners. This trial aims to establish a model for child oral health promotion for culturally diverse communities in Australia. Methods and analysis: This is an exploratory trial implementing a community-based child oral health promotion intervention for Australian families from refugee and migrant backgrounds. Families from an Iraqi, Lebanese or Pakistani background with children aged 1 – 4  years, residing in metropolitan Melbourne, {{were invited to participate}} in the trial by peer educators from their respective communities using snowball and purposive sampling techniques.

40|$|Introduction: Key {{recommendations}} of the World Health Organisation (WHO) global strategy are cost-saving, feasible and dynamic approaches {{for the management of}} Type II Diabetes mellitus. Whilst the impacts of socio-economic and psychological factors on management of the condition are well evidenced, understanding of organisational factors in the context of primary care is equally pivotal yet relatively little researched. Considerations of the geo-political and cultural context of healthcare provision could potentially identify additional information towards Type II Diabetes mellitus management. Nurses {{are an integral part of}} the global health professional workforce, whose contribution to evidence-based practice, could potentially contribute to the modernisation of nursing care for people living with Type II Diabetes mellitus. Aims: To understand and analyse nurses’ experiences on drivers of and barriers to evidence based Type II Diabetes mellitus management in Nigeria. Methods: Using a Grounded Theory approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 nurses in Nigeria. Data sets were analysed using Interpretive Framework Analysis. Results: Nurses do not perceive organisational factors to be standalone factors influencing the management of Type II Diabetes mellitus in hospital settings. However, novel and flexible approaches such as using of humour and anecdotes during counselling, patient networking, use of dosette boxes and involvement of social welfare services were highlighted as drivers of management. Barriers to management were identified as conflict between tribal languages, limited resources, cultural orientation, community knowledge, and information management.

40|$|Many {{countries}} {{are seeking to}} strengthen global economic competitiveness by building a 'knowledge economy' capability. A popular approach is supporting university-industry knowledge exchange linkages. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to show how a model developed by the Cambridge-MIT Institute (CMI) for the UK offers a more effective approach to knowledge sharing, and to present the results from one of the first projects launched by CMI. CMI looked at the background literature and relevant government policy, benchmarked peer grant-making organisations, studied the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Cambridge University institutions, and organized expert consultation through a strategic planning process including 27 stakeholder groups. Based on these inputs, CMI formulated its Knowledge Integration Community (KIC) model hypothesis. This paper describes the functional components, support mechanisms, <b>organisational</b> structure, <b>review</b> processes and mechanisms for knowledge exchange. Beginning in 2003, CMI built seven experimental KICs: five completely new, and two built up from existing, more traditional research projects. One of these is the Silent Aircraft KIC, which is presented as a case study. The paper makes an early analysis of the outcomes and additionalities of the KIC, and presents the lessons and future implications for the KIC. The paper concludes by describing the broader relevance of this approach for other institutions and countries, and suggests it is something other university-, government- and industry-based research institutions could embark upon. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{review of}} the {{literature}} critically analyses eleven qualitative studies (2005 – 2014) that report the views of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It seeks to consider the methods used by researchers in order to identify potential factors that restrict or enable children to give their views. Studies are dominated by male adolescents with a diagnosis of Aspergers or High Functioning Autism with views sought by interview or group discussion, including adapted visual and activity based methods. There is no clear evidence to show which methods are most effective, and there is a gap in the literature with the views of children under eleven years of age, females and those attending special educational provision poorly represented. The findings inform an exploratory study that seeks to consider how a young child might be enabled to give their views in the process of diagnostic assessment for ASD. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis is used to review the narrative of a five year old child, and shows the age at which some children can actively participate in giving their views and experiences is lower than previously thought. The researcher reflects on a diagnostic practice model that moves from a reliance on deficit patterns of behaviour to also ask what sense the child makes of their experiences, and to consider how this might impact in clinical practice. The critical appraisal describes a reflexive account of the research process. The service evaluation seeks to critically evaluate available data for a community service for children with neurodevelopmental needs in order to inform evaluative practice. Undertaken during a period of <b>organisational</b> <b>review,</b> different approaches to evaluation are considered before collating the service data and considering its application in two different evaluative frameworks.

A number of proprietorial and open sources hosting solutions were investigated with the Library selecting Open Journal Systems as the product on which to build the platform. The Library successfully bid for AUT Capex funding for the project and work began in February 2016. The project was led by the Library’s Scholarly Communications team, established as an outcome of an <b>organisational</b> <b>review</b> of its Digital Services unit and in recognition of an emerging and significant area for academic libraries. The project team connected with key stakeholders across the university, including ICT, the Research and Innovation Office and a wide range of academic staff.

40|$|The current New Zealand tax {{disputes}} resolution {{procedures were}} enacted in 1996 following a recommendation {{made by the}} <b>Organisational</b> <b>Review</b> Committee of the Inland Revenue Department in 1994. Yet, following their enactment and despite a number of positive aspects to the disputes resolution procedures, commentators and professional bodies alike have continued to raise concerns that inefficiencies, {{particularly with respect to}} time and cost, are affecting their operation and are, consequently, adversely impacting on taxpayers’ perceptions of the fairness of the procedures. It is believed that this is potentially negatively impacting on the tax system and on taxpayer voluntary compliance. Consequently, suggestions have been made for the use of alternative disputes resolution procedures, such as mediation, as another method to resolve tax disputes. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a refined tax mediation regime for New Zealand through improving the features of the proposed tax mediation regime for New Zealand’s tax disputes resolution system first developed by Jone and Maples (2012 b). Utilising a sequential mixed methods approach, consisting of a quantitative survey questionnaire followed by a qualitative focus group interview, this study seeks feedback on Jone and Maples’ (2012 b) proposed New Zealand tax mediation regime from purposively selected practitioners (experts) in the tax disputes resolution and mediation fields. The feedback obtained is used in refining Jone and Maples’ (2012 b) proposed tax mediation regime. This study finds that the most important aspect of the refined proposed regime is the inclusion of a mediator who is independent of both parties and moreover, that the mediator is foremost trained and qualified in mediation as opposed to being a specialist in tax law. The findings also indicate that mediation should not be made a mandatory phase of the disputes procedures. This study recommends that the refined tax mediation regime should be an administrative phase and incorporated with the existing conference phase in a proposed ‘ADR stage’ of the disputes procedures. Notwithstanding the potential budgetary and resource constraints, the findings indicate that if mediation were to be provided as a cost-free service, taxpayers (particularly small taxpayers) should be appreciative of the opportunity to put their cases forward and be heard, even if an agreement has not been reached through mediation. The literature suggests that this should in turn enhance taxpayers’ perceptions of fairness of the disputes procedures and thereby voluntary compliance. This study provides a foundation for the further development of tax mediation in New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|Studies of the {{diffusion}} of innovation have covered {{a wide range of}} industry sectors and information system types over recent years. As Electronic Commerce grows in importance, however, it becomes increasingly urgent to understand how the innovations of technology and business processes which E-Commerce involves can be explained and understood in terms of their potential for innovation and for major changes in ways of doing business. Adoption of Electronic Commerce thus fixes attention on the significance of organisational issues in the successful takeup of innovative technologies. By applying theoretical perspectives from other disciplines and methodologies, as researchers, we were able to widen the scope of our enquiry and pool the lessons we derived from these wider perspectives. Following from this broader theoretical perspective, we present a rationale for reviewing themes in the literature of diffusion and <b>organisational</b> literature. Our <b>review</b> showed that the linear, or stage, m [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: We {{investigated}} {{the effects on}} collaborative work within the UK National Health Service (NHS) of an intervention for service quality improvement: informal, structured, reciprocated, multidisciplinary peer review with feedback and action plans. The setting was care for {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Theory and methods: We analysed semi-structured interviews with 43 hospital respiratory consultants, nurses and general managers at 24 intervention and 11 control sites, as part of a UK randomised controlled study, the National COPD Resources and Outcomes Project (NCROP), using Scott’s conceptual framework for action (inter-organisational, intra-organisational, inter-professional and inter-individual). Three areas of care targeted by NCROP involved collaboration across primary and secondary care. Results: Hospital respiratory department collaborations with commissioners and hospital managers varied. Analysis suggested that this is related to team responses to barriers. Clinicians in unsuccessful collaborations told ‘atrocity stories’ of organisational, structural and professional barriers to service improvement. The others removed barriers by working with government and commissioner agendas to ensure continued involvement in patients’ care. Multidisciplinary peer review facilitated collaboration between participants, enabling them to meet, reconcile differences and exchange ideas across boundaries. Conclusions: The data come from the first randomised controlled trial of <b>organisational</b> peer <b>review,</b> adding to research into UK health service collaborative work, which has had a more restricted focus on inter-professional relations. NCROP peer review may only modestly improve collaboration but these data suggest it might be more effective than top-down exhortations to change when collaboration both across and within organisations is required...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Provides a {{comprehensive}} review of the identity literature drawing on perspectives from marketing (corporate identity concept) and organisational behaviour (organisational identity) so as to provide an up-to –date overview of identity scholarship. Findings – Reveals a growing congruency between scholars of marketing and organisational behaviour in their comprehension of identity. Identifies four principal schools of thought relating to identity which differ in terms of conceptualisation, locus of analysis and explanandum (corporate identity, visual identity, an organisation’s identity and <b>organisational</b> identity). Our <b>review</b> confirms the importance of identity especially in relation to the concepts underpinning the nascent field of corporate-level marketing. Practical implications – the importance of taking a multidisciplinary perspective in the comprehension and management of identity in organisational contexts. Originality/Value – The first major review of identity studies that synthesises the marketing and organisational behaviour approaches to identity. Offers pointers in terms of the research agenda to be followed...|$|R
