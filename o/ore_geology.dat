30|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to study the large-strain consolidation modeling of mine waste tailings. Initially, a stat-of-the-art was established focusing on process phenomenology and coordinate systems for tailings dewatering thereby devising a simple constitutive equation with a small number of input parameters. Next, a one-dimensional self-weight consolidation model was developed for quiescent conditions because of negligible lateral drainage, absence of surcharge loading, and diminishing effect of filling on underlying sediments in the containment facilities. Finite element analysis was chosen for model development because of its robustness in capturing the changes in material coordinates during large strain tailings consolidation. The model was applied to capture the behaviour {{of a wide range of}} tailings using the tailings classification scheme of Paul and Azam (2013) that captures physicochemical interactions arising from <b>ore</b> <b>geology</b> and mill processing. Finally, test data on oil sand fine tailings were used for model calibration and predictions were made for an upper bound and a lower bound of various tailings types using a 1 m high hypothetical column.|$|E

This conclusion is strongly supported by the δ 18 O values of the early- and main-stage ore fluids, which range from 9. 5 ‰ to 15. 3 ‰, with corresponding δD values between - 86 ‰ ∼ - 73 ‰.

Metals that have been leached from the oxidized ore are carried downward by percolating groundwater, and react with hypogene sulfides at the supergene-hypogene boundary. The reaction produces secondary sulfides with metal contents higher than those of the primary ore. This is particularly noted in copper ore deposits where the copper sulfide minerals chalcocite Cu2S, covellite CuS, digenite Cu1.8S, and djurleite Cu31S16 are deposited by the descending surface waters.|$|R

To time the mineralization, the authors dated grains of biotites and muscovites {{separated}} from Au-Cu-bearing quartz-vein, using high-resolution single-grain laser-ablation 40 Ar/ 39 Ar method. 22 analyses of biotites yielded a 40 Ar/ 39 Ar isochron age of 396 ± 2 Ma (MSWD = 20), and 23 of muscovites yielded a 40 Ar/ 39 Ar isochron age of 358 ± 2 Ma (n = 23, MSWD = 11). This shows that the ore bodies have been formed in Devonian. In the ore field, the magmatites, such as granitic porphyries, yielded isotope ages ranging from 428 to 466 Ma, which predated mineralization by > 40 Ma; while the ore-hosting stratum was suggested to have been formed around 1130 Ma, which predated mineralization by > 700 Ma. This evidenced that the Bainaimiao deposit is neither of porphyry-type nor of submarine sedimentary-exhalative type.

Ore formation is essentially synchronous with post-extensional dome uplift and magmatism, which has a dominant crustal magma component according to Pb and Sr isotope data. Intermediate- and high-sulphidation Pb–Zn–Ag–Au deposits and minor porphyry Cu–Mo mineralization in the Eastern Rhodopes are predominantly hosted by veins in shoshonitic to high-K calc-alkaline volcanic rocks of closely similar age. Base-metal-poor, high-grade gold deposits of low sulphidation character occurring in continental sedimentary rocks of synextensional basins (e. g., Ada Tepe) show a close spatial and temporal relation to detachment faulting prior and during metamorphic core complex formation. Their formation predates local magmatism but may involve fluids from deep mantle magmas. The change in geochemical signatures of Palaeogene magmatic rocks, from predominantly silicic types in the Central Rhodopes to strongly fractionated shoshonitic (Bulgaria) to calc-alkaline and high-K calc-alkaline (Greece) magmas in the Eastern Rhodopes, coincides with the enrichment in Cu and Au relative to Pb and Zn of the associated ore deposits. This trend also correlates with a decrease in the radiogenic Pb and Sr isotope components of the magmatic rocks from west to east, reflecting a reduced crustal contamination of mantle magmas, which in turn correlates with a decreasing crustal thickness that 2 : Hydrothermal ore deposits related to post-orogenic extensiona...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecent {{advances}} in geosciences make {{more and more}} multidisciplinary data available for mining exploration. This allowed developing methodologies for computing forecast ore maps from the statistical combination of such different input parameters, all based on an inverse problem theory. Numerous statistical methods (e. g. algebraic method, weight of evidence, Siris method, etc) {{with varying degrees of}} complexity in their development and implementation, have been proposed and/or adapted for <b>ore</b> <b>geology</b> purposes. In literature, such approaches are often presented through applications on natural examples and the results obtained can present specificities due to local characteristics. Moreover, though crucial for statistical computations, "minimum requirements" needed for input parameters (number of minimum data points, spatial distribution of objects, etc) are often only poorly expressed. From these, problems often arise when one has to choose between one and the other method for her/his specific question. In this study, a direct statistical modeling approach is developed in order to i) evaluate the constraints on the input parameters and ii) test the validity of different existing inversion methods. The approach particularly focused on the analysis of spatial relationships between location of points and various objects (e. g. polygons and /or polylines) which is particularly well adapted to constrain the influence of intrusive bodies - such as a granite - and faults or ductile shear-zones on spatial location of ore deposits (point objects). The method is designed in a way to insure a-dimensionality with respect to scale. In this approach, both spatial distribution and topology of objects (polygons and polylines) can be parametrized by the user (e. g. density of objects, length, surface, orientation, clustering). Then, the distance of points with respect to a given type of objects (polygons or polylines) is given using a probability distribution. The location of points is computed assuming either independency or different grades of dependency between the two probability distributions. The results show that i) polygons surface mean value, polylines length mean value, the number of objects and their clustering are critical and ii) the validity of the different tested inversion methods strongly depends on the relative importance and on the dependency between the parameters used. In addition, this combined approach of direct and inverse modeling offers an opportunity to test the robustness of the inferred distribution point laws with respect {{to the quality of the}} input data set...|$|E

40|$|Determining the {{absolute}} duration of magmatic-hydrothermal events {{leading to the}} formation of porphyry systems (i. e., including porphyry copper, skarn, and epithermal deposits) {{is one of the key}} questions in <b>ore</b> <b>geology.</b> This is so because the duration of magmatic-hydrothermal events in porphyry systems is instrumental to the development of genetic models necessary to explore a category of mineral deposits that provide most of the copper and significant amounts of base and precious metals to our economy. The problem of determining {{the absolute}} duration of magmatic-hydrothermal events in porphyry systems has been addressed through ther- mal modeling of cooling intrusions and time needed to precipitate specified metal amounts from active hydro- thermal systems with known metal concentrations and fluid fluxes. Both these methods have shown that the likely duration of hydrothermal systems is on the order of a few tens of kilo-annum (ka). Isotopic dating in con- trast is the only possible way to determine the life span of magmatic-hydrothermal events in fossil porphyry sys- tems. Analytical and methodological developments during the last decade in the fields of the most robust iso- topic systems commonly used for absolute dating (U-Pb, 40 Ar/ 39 Ar, Re-Os) allow us to date minerals with internal precisions < 0. 2 % (2 σ). For a 10 -Ma-old mineral this corresponds to a < 20 -ka uncertainty, which is mar- ginally sufficient to discriminate the duration of hydrothermal systems at the tens of kilo-annum scale. How- ever, many geochronological studies on fossil porphyry systems have shown that these are most often formed through repeated cycles of several intrusion events, which extend the overall life of the porphyry systems to a few 0. X and up to ~ 2 Ma in some cases. Internal precisions of the above mentioned dating methods allow us, in theory, to comfortably discriminate events at the 0. X scale and the combination of U-Pb, 40 Ar/ 39 Ar, and Re- Os geochronology is a tool widely used by ore geologists to bracket the duration of cyclic magmatic-hydro- thermal events in porphyry systems. In this review we discuss some fundamental problems that are systematically overlooked in most geochrono- logical studies trying to bracket the life span of porphyry systems. We show that if these problems are not adequately taken into account and tackled the result will be that fundamentally wrong life spans of porphyry sys- tems will be estimated.

40|$|Variability in the 2 ̆ 2 light 2 ̆ 2 (e. g., H, C, O, N, S) {{stable isotope}} {{composition}} of minerals {{has long been}} used to elucidate geochemical processes. The development of multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) techniques {{has led to the}} study of isotope variability in increasingly heavy elements due to the increase in precision and ionization potential compared to older isotope analytical techniques. Despite the increasing use of stable isotopes as geochemical tracers, those of the element tellurium have been relatively understudied. The three studies presented here provide the first analyses of tellurium isotope variability in tellurides and native tellurium, as well as tellurates and tellurites. The first study presents a methodology for the extraction and purification of Te from such minerals, as well as for their analysis using MC-ICP-MS. Importantly, this study established that processing and analytical techniques do not induce isotopic fractionation. Furthermore, with a δ 130 / 125 Te range of 1. 6 /, the preliminary isotope data from the methods development process suggested appreciable fractionation of Te, even at elevated temperatures. The second study presents data for 82 Te-rich minerals of various oxidation states and compares those empirical data to experimental data from thermodynamic calculations. The samples were unlocated beyond the general area of their collection. The overall range of fractionation for Te is 2. 85 / and seems to be dominated by mass-dependent processes. Redox reactions do not seem to induce large fractionations, which contradicts thermodynamic predictions, and suggests that disequilibrium processes may have occurred during changes in valence state. The final study of this dissertation is related to well-located tellurides and native tellurium from the epithermal Emperor gold telluride deposit, Fiji. Here, we report a range of Te isotope values of 1. 13 /. The preliminary dataset presented shows that samples hosted within the volcanic caldera have a more narrow range than those hosted in adjacent rock, suggesting that wall rock interaction during magmatic-hydrothermal fluid flow may be responsible for some amount of fractionation. Like other epithermal deposits, Te isotope values at Emperor are relatively tightly clustered, in contrast to those from the orogenic Kalgoorlie gold telluride deposit.

40|$|Nonsulfide zinc {{deposits}} (NSZ) are {{a relatively}} uncommon ore type. They were the earliest source for mined zinc, {{and in the}} last years have enjoyed a renewed interest due to new processing technologies. Two types of deposits are indicated: hypogene and supergene [1], which can be distinguished according to their geological setting and mineralogical characteristics. Hypogene ores are derived from high temperature fluids in hydrothermal and/or metamorphic environments (e. g. Vazante-Brazil, Beltana-Australia and Franklin-USA). Hypogene NSZ mainly consist of anhydrous zinc silicates and oxides. They are less abundant and economically less significant (with the exception of Vazante) than supergene types. Supergene NSZ are derived from the weathering of primary sulfide deposits: a combination of conditions is needed for the development of economically significant deposits of this type. Key conditions include: (1) pre-existing zinc concentrations, (2) efficient oxidation promoted by tectonic uplift and/or prolonged deep weathering; (3) permeable wall rock to allow for ground-water movement; (4) effective trap sites; (5) hydrogeological environments that do not promote dispersion and loss of Zn-bearing fluids. These deposits contain hydrated zinc silicates and carbonates such as hemimorphite (Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 ???H 2 O) and hydrozincite (Zn 5 (CO 3) 2 (OH) 6), or the most common carbonate smithsonite (ZnCO 3). The best example of a supergene nonsulfide Zn deposit is the Skorpion operation in Namibia [2]. There are other examples: e. g. Accha [3] and Yanque [4] in Peru, or Hakkari [5] in Turkey. Other deposits, which have been long considered supergene, are instead related to the circulation of low temperature hydrothermal fluids (as Angouran in Iran [6], and -partly- the well-known ???La Calamine??? deposit in Belgium). Recent developments in processing technologies for the treatment of NSZ zinc deposits (acid-leaching, AmmLeach®, pyrometallurgy, electrowinning) have increased the commercial interest for NSZ ores with a revival in exploration throughout the world, blossoming {{at the beginning of the}} twenty-first century. Nevertheless, at several mines the hydro-metallurgical plants are underperforming relative to initial expectations, which has resulted in delays to the development of NSZ deposits exploitation. Capital and operating costs, acid consumption and metal recoveries have not completely met the feasibility study expectation, and other oxide resources (Mehdiabad-Iran, Sierra Mojada-Mexico, Torlon Hill-Guatemala, Jabali-Yemen) are still battling with technical and/or political issues. However, many technical problems can be mitigated by a better identification of the mineralogical association of the metallic and nonmetallic minerals. This should be a fundamental step in the exploration of nonsulfide mineral deposits, because the extraction process is highly sensitive to mineralogy. Therefore, before the metallurgical processing methods are chosen, it is necessary to take into account both the physical and chemical properties of the ores and their gangue minerals.

40|$|Abstract. The {{disasters}} {{dynamics and}} security of phosphate are important problems in Phosphorus ore-deposit mining. So monitoring in unstable, hazardous areas and goaf can effectively focus on the activities of ground pressure. Based on mine-site exploration, engineering test, collection of physical and mechanical parameters for <b>ore,</b> research of <b>geology</b> and mining conditions, the main controlling factors of ground pressure were identified. Combining practical projects, the fuzzy matter-element model of stability evaluation on ground pressure in empty areas was built and analyzed, which showed the good agreement with the evaluation results and measured values. At the same time, based on the stability of underground mining partition, automatic monitoring system of phosphate was constructed, which may provide some useful advices for the safety study of ground pressure in phosphate rock mass...|$|R
50|$|J.J. {{was born}} in Waymart, Pennsylvania. His father, James Brown, was an Irish immigrant. His mother, Cecilia Palmer, was a schoolteacher. J.J's family moved to Pittston, Pennsylvania shortly after his birth. J.J's mother home-schooled him and later sent him to St. John's Academy. He left home {{at the age of}} 23, lured by the riches in the West. His first stop was a farm in Nebraska. From Nebraska he moved to the placer mines in the Dakotas. He spent two years {{learning}} the mining trade before moving to Colorado where he tried his luck in Georgetown, Aspen, and Ashcroft. He spent another two years in the Aspen and Ashcroft area before moving to Alma, Fairplay, Red Cliff, and, finally, Leadville. He studied <b>geology,</b> <b>ore</b> deposits, and mining techniques to become a better miner.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Geochemistry of the {{suspended}} particulate matter (SPM) collected during the monsoon was determined to identify the sources of SPM and to understand the physico-chemical processes in the Mandovi and Zuari River estuaries. The concentrations of SPM decrease seaward in both estuaries, but are relatively high at bay stations. Kaolinite is the most dominant clay mineral in the upstream of both rivers. Smectite increases seaward in both estuaries and is abundant in the bay. Upstream stations of Mandovi, where ore deposits are stored on the shore, exhibit high Fe, Mn, ΣREE and, middle REE- and heavy REE-enriched REE patterns. Channel stations of both estuaries exhibit middle REE- and light REE-enriched patterns, which gradually changed seaward to middle REE- and heavy REE enriched patterns. Canal stations exhibit highest concentrations of major and trace metals. High metal/Al ratios occur at stations in the upstream of Zuari and at the confluence of canal in the Mandovi estuary. Enrichment factors of metals indicate that Mn is significantly polluted while other metals are moderately polluted. The δ 13 C and δ 15 N of organic matter indicate that the terrigenous organic matter at the upstream is diluted seaward by marine organic matter. Organic matter at bay stations is largely marine and altered-type. The compositions of SPM are controlled by the particulates from <b>ore</b> dust, <b>geology</b> of the drainage basins and physico-chemical processes in the estuaries. Particulate...|$|R
