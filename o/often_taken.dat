5|$|A {{vector space}} (also called a linear space) is a {{collection}} of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers, called scalars. Scalars are <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> to be real numbers, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex numbers, rational numbers, or generally any field. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called axioms, listed below.|$|E
5|$|Apollo Robbins medallions {{were also}} struck, in very small numbers, in 14k gold. These medallions were {{generally}} {{ordered by the}} mission crew as a personal memento of their flight and were <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> to the lunar surface in the Landing Module. For {{the duration of the}} Apollo program, Robbins medallions (3–7 gold and 80–450 silver per mission) were flown into space.|$|E
5|$|Fleming endowed Bond {{with many}} of his own traits, {{including}} sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries. Bond's tastes are also <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> from Fleming's own as was his behaviour, with Bond's love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming's own. Fleming used his experiences of his espionage career and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{within a few}} years to decades of the {{destruction}} of Easter Island society by slave raiding and introduced epidemics, two amateur investigators recorded readings and recitations of rongorongo tablets by Easter Islanders.

5|$|Other {{blood tests}} are <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> to help {{understand}} a person's general health and risk {{factors that may}} contribute to heart disease. These often include a full blood count investigating for anaemia, and basic metabolic panel that may reveal any disturbances in electrolytes. A coagulation screen is often required {{to ensure that the}} right level of anticoagulation is given. Fasting lipids and fasting blood glucose (or an HbA1c level) are often ordered to evaluate a person's cholesterol and diabetes status, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Franciscan Order had {{a strong}} {{following}} by the 15th century; its Third Order of Saint Francis attracted women and men to local lay confraternities, such as the Confraternity of the Dry Tree in Bruges to which Anselme Adornes belonged. St Francis was closely associated with pilgrimages, then popular and most <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> to holy sites in Spain and Jerusalem. He was revered for his own pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1219; by the 15th century the Franciscans were responsible for maintaining the holy sites in Jerusalem, particularly the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.|$|E

5|$|The oceanic whitetip is {{a commercially}} {{important}} species for its fins, meat, and oil. It is eaten fresh, smoked, dried, and salted and its hide {{is used for}} leather. It is subject to fishing pressure throughout virtually its whole rangealthough it is more <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> as bycatch than by design, since it is drawn to longline bait that is intended for other species.|$|E
5|$|The role of {{the main}} {{caregiver}} is <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> by the spouse or a close relative. Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a great burden on caregivers which includes social, psychological, physical or economic aspects.

Nevertheless, two-thirds of nursing home residents have dementias.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{traditional}} biblical {{date for the}} narrative of Joseph’s life and death places him in Egypt {{in the middle of}} the Twelfth Dynasty, roughly comparable to the Hyksos invasion of Egypt, contemporary scholarship no longer accepts such a remote dating.

5|$|An {{important}} attribute in {{this dog}} was a tempered aggressiveness {{that would provide}} the necessary drive to pursue and bolt the fox, without resulting in physical harm to the quarry and effectively ending the chase, which was considered unsporting. Russell {{was said to have}} prided himself that his terriers never tasted blood. This line of terriers developed by John Russell was well respected for those qualities, and his dogs were <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> on by hunt enthusiasts. It is unlikely, however, that any dogs alive today can be proven to be descendants from Trump, as Russell was forced to sell all his dogs {{on more than one occasion}} because of financial difficulty, and had only four aged (and non-breeding) terriers left when he died in 1883.|$|E
5|$|Because of its poor flying ability, {{large size}} and {{possible}} island tameness, the broad-billed parrot was easy prey for sailors who visited Mauritius, and their nests {{would have been}} extremely vulnerable to predation by introduced crab-eating macaques and rats. Various sources indicate the bird was aggressive, {{which may explain why}} it held out so long against introduced animals after all. The bird is believed to have become extinct by the 1680s, when the palms it may have sustained itself on were harvested on a large scale. Unlike other parrot species, which were <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> as pets by sailors, there are no records of broad-billed parrots being transported from Mauritius either live or dead, perhaps because of the stigma associated with ravens. The birds would not in any case have survived such a journey if they refused to eat anything but seeds.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War Fleming was the {{personal}} {{assistant to the}} director of the Naval Intelligence Division, Admiral John Godfrey. He reached the rank of commander—a rank he subsequently gave to his fictional creation—and was the planner for special operations unit 30th Assault Unit. Many of Bond's tastes and traits were Fleming's own, including sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries. Bond's tastes are also <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> from Fleming's, as was his behaviour, with Bond's love of golf and gambling mirroring his creator's. Fleming used the experiences of his espionage career and other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.|$|E

5|$|Falstaff {{had been}} of {{interest}} to Shakespearean commentators for years. Forty years earlier, a full-length book had appeared, An Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir John Falstaff (1777), by Maurice Morgann, <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> {{as the beginning of}} that school of Shakespearean criticism which considers the characters of Shakespeare's plays as though they were real people. Hazlitt, who seems to have had little acquaintance with Morgann's work, is careful never to lose sight of Falstaff's status as a character in a play—three plays, in fact, though the two parts of Henry IV are examined in a single essay.|$|E
5|$|Once the badnjak has burnt through, the thicker end is <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> out of {{the fire}} and used {{according}} to the local custom. It may be carried around the beehives, extinguished, and placed between {{the branches of a}} young plum or apple tree. The men may make crosses from it and put them under the eaves, on the fields, meadows, vineyards, and apiaries, so that the coming year may be happy and fruitful. It may also be set aside for next Christmas Eve, to be placed on the fire immediately before the new badnjak, as a symbol of continuity. In Kosovo, a part of the badnjak is preserved and burned again on New Years Day and Epiphany.|$|E
5|$|Robson {{was born}} in Sacriston, County Durham, the fourth of five sons of Philip and Lilian Robson (née Watt). When he was a few months old, Robson's family moved to the nearby village of Langley Park where {{his father was a}} coal miner. Their two-bedroom house had no bath and an outside toilet. As a boy, he was <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> by his father to watch Newcastle United play at St James' Park on Saturday afternoons, {{requiring}} a 34-mile round trip. Robson describes Jackie Milburn and Len Shackleton as his childhood heroes. Both played for Newcastle in the inside-forward position, the position Robson would later assume during his playing career.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} print runs used Thayer and Company lithographers, with one litho stone for {{the color and}} the other for {{printing}} black on the white paper stock. Because the paper of 1840's through 1890's included a lavish amount of fiber, <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> from mummy wrappings, it would not fade or decompose like the wood pulp paper used today. The first print run copied the Laurie and Whittles game. Laurie and Whittles used gold ink. Thayer mixed his ink to look gold but it really was a goldish brown. Like Laurie and Whittles game, Thayer used an octagonal end space.|$|E
5|$|Those {{countries}} have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an English-based creole {{to a more}} standard version of English. They have many more speakers of English who acquire English {{in the process of}} growing up through day by day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by speakers who are not native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners. Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries, and they may have grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.|$|E
5|$|Troponin is a {{sensitive}} biomarker {{for a heart}} with insufficient blood supply. It is released 4–6 hours after injury, and usually peaks at about 12–24 hours. Two tests of troponin are <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> – one {{at the time of}} initial presentation, and another within 3–6 hours, with either a high level or a significant rise being diagnostic. A test for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can be used to evaluate for the presence of heart failure, and rises when there is increased demand on the left ventricle. These tests are considered biomarkers because they are highly specific for cardiac disease. Testing for the MB form of creatine kinase provides information about the heart's blood supply, but is used less frequently because it is less specific and sensitive.|$|E
