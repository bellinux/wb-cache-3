50|$|To ensure success, desired {{operational}} outcomes must be imparted during {{design and}} development. These include such design-dependent parameters as reliability, maintainability, supportability, usability, producibility, disposability, sustainability, affordability and others. These parameters {{are required to}} be considered at {{the early stages of}} design if desired operational behaviours are to be realised. A system design and development requires appropriate and timely application of engineering and management efforts to meet the previously mentioned parameters. A system may serve its intended purpose most effectively when its technical and operating characteristics are engineered into the design. Therefore, <b>operational</b> <b>feasibility</b> is a critical aspect of systems engineering that needs to {{be an integral part of}} the early design phases.|$|E
5000|$|Scott {{served as}} Command Module Pilot for Apollo 9 (March 3-13, 1969). This {{was the third}} manned flight in the Apollo series, the second to be {{launched}} by a Saturn V, {{and the first to}} complete a comprehensive earth-orbital qualification and verification test of a [...] "fully configured Apollo spacecraft." [...] The ten-day flight provided vital information previously not available on the operational performance, stability, and reliability of lunar module propulsion and life support systems. Highlight of this evaluation was completion of a critical lunar-orbit rendezvous simulation and subsequent docking, initiated by James McDivitt and Rusty Schweickart from within the Lunar Module at a separation distance which exceeded 100 miles (160 km) from the command/service module piloted by Scott. The crew also demonstrated and confirmed the <b>operational</b> <b>feasibility</b> of crew transfer and extravehicular activity techniques and equipment, with Schweickart completing a 46-minute EVA outside the Lunar Module. During this period, Dave Scott completed a 1-hour stand-up EVA in the open Command Module hatch photographing Schweickart's activities and also retrieving thermal samples from the Command Module exterior. Apollo 9 splashed down less than four nautical miles (7 km) from the helicopter carrier USS Guadalcanal (LPH-7).|$|E

5000|$|The Viper Strike bomb first {{underwent}} {{testing in}} 2003. On March 29 and 30, Viper Strikes released from an RQ-5 Hunter UAV scored 7 out of 10 direct hits at White Sands Missile Range. The other three bombs missed their targets {{by a few}} feet but still inflicted measurable damage. The objective of the tests was to validate {{the concept of the}} Viper Strike and the <b>operational</b> <b>feasibility</b> of Viper Strike integrated on the Hunter UAV. [...] In June 2005, Northrop integrated the Global Positioning System (GPS) into the laser-guided munition to provide highly accurate midcourse guidance. This allowed the weapon to be launched from much greater altitude and standoff range. During tests, an unarmed weapon successfully acquired GPS data after dispensing from an aircraft and flew to pre-assigned GPS waypoints. Following an extended, nearly horizontal midcourse flight, the GPS-enhanced munition switched over to the semi-active laser seeker once it entered the target area to detect and track the laser-designated target. In January 2007, Viper Strikes successfully destroyed a series of moving and stationary targets in testing at the White Sands Missile Range. They were guided to their targets by the Hunter UAV's laser targeting system.|$|E
5000|$|Hong Lam Marine {{was founded}} in 1981 by Lim Teck Cheng, the current Chief Executive, {{together}} with his father. Business began with two wooden barges chartered to Esso Singapore, which transported fuel within the Singapore port. In the same year, Esso Singapore awarded two more contracts to Hong Lam Marine. Hong Lam Marine expanded their fleet with the purchase of two steel bunker tankers from Japan. These were then modified to meet the local regulations for operating in the Port of Singapore. In 1989, the company started building single-hull ships of 4,000 - 6,000 DWT. [...] In 2005, Hong Lam Marine ventured into the building of double-hull vessels. In 2007, the company went on to form a joint-venture company with the Japanese trading house, Toyota Tsusho, to build and own two 22,000 DWT tankers, SPECTRUM and SPLENDOUR. These two world’s largest purpose-built bunker tankers were delivered in 2009. Hong Lam Marine works closely with the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) to implement green shipping practices. The company commissioned a series of 10 diesel-electric bunkering vessels, which were delivered between 2011 and 2013. They are also the first company in Singapore to use MPA approved mass flow meters on its vessels for bunker delivery. According to Mr Lim, these mass flow meters “can supply 15 to 20% more fuel” for their vessels and also save up to 3 hours per bunker delivery. The company is also involved in a Joint Industry Project (JIP) to investigate the <b>operational</b> <b>feasibility</b> of liquefied natural gas (LNG) bunkering in Singapore in collaboration with 22 industry partners. Currently, the use of LNG in Singapore is hindered by the high operating costs required to purchase and transport it, {{as well as a}} lack of demand for it.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA preliminary study was completed that measured the <b>operational</b> and technical <b>feasibility</b> of video teleconferencing (VTC) at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). As {{a part of}} the fact-finding effort, a VTC Round Table was convened in order to define the nature of the problems that prompted NPS to consider VTC as a possible solution. Potential opportunities for utilizing VTC {{to improve the quality of}} education offered by NPS were discussed, and various alternatives for installing a system were considered. It was concluded that the <b>operational</b> and technical <b>feasibility</b> were convincing enough to justify the continuation of VTC implementation at NPS. The economic aspects were viewed to be of secondary importance because case studies indicate that the quantitative benefits such as travel displacement have been overshadowed by the qualitative gains such as increased productivity. This study recommends that NPS move ahead with its plans to implement a "full-feature" VTC system and install it in a new academic building currently under construction. Additionally, this study acknowledges the findings of the draft DoD instruction "Teleconferencing Activities, Systems and Networks" which endorses the use of the Federal Telecommunications System (FTS) 2000 for long-haul network services. It is recommended that NPS utilize the FTS 2000 Compressed Video Teleconferencing System (CVTS) for its VTC needs, and lease the VTC equipment with an option to buy. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{illustrate}} how pragmatic trial design elements, or inserting explanatory trial elements in pragmatic trials affect validity, generalizability, precision and <b>operational</b> <b>feasibility.</b> STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: From illustrative examples identified through the IMI Get Real Consortium, we selected randomized drug trials with a pragmatic design feature. We searched all publications on these trials {{for information on}} how pragmatic trial design features affect validity, generalizability, precision or feasibility. RESULTS: We present examples from the Salford Lung Study, INterSePT, STAR*D and CRUCIAL trial. These examples show that incorporating pragmatic trial design elements in trials may affect generalizability, precision, validity and may lead to operational challenges different from traditional explanatory trials. Inserting explanatory trial elements into pragmatic trials may also affect validity, generalizability and <b>operational</b> <b>feasibility,</b> especially when these trial elements are incorporated in one arm of the trial only. Design choices that positively affect one of these domains (for example generalizability), may negatively affect others (for example feasibility). CONCLUSION: Consequences of incorporating pragmatic or explanatory trial design elements in pragmatic trials should be explicitly considered and balanced for all relevant domains, including validity, generalizability, precision and <b>operational</b> <b>feasibility.</b> Tools are needed to make these consequences more transparent...|$|E

40|$|When {{the result}} of a {{previous}} instruction is needed in the pipeline before it is available, a "data hazard" occurs. Register Forwarding and Pipeline Interlock (RF&PI) are mechanisms suitable to avoid data corruption and to limit the performance penalty caused by data hazards in pipelined microprocessors. Data hazards handling is part of the 1 microprocessor control logic; its test can hardly be achieved with a functional approach, unless a specific test algorithm is adopted. In this paper we analyze the causes for the low functional testability of the RF&PI logic and propose some techniques able to effectively perform its test. In particular, we describe a strategy to perform Software-Based Self-Test (SBST) on the RF&PI unit. The general structure of the unit is analyzed, a suitable test algorithm is proposed and the strategy to observe the test responses is explained. The method can be exploited for test both at the end of manufacturing and in the <b>operational</b> phase. <b>Feasibility</b> and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated on both an academic MIPS-like processor and an industrial System-on-Chip based on the Power ArchitectureT...|$|R

50|$|A 2004 documentary, Auschwitz; the {{forgotten}} evidence included interviews with historians William Rubinstein and Richard Overy. It mentioned the Jewish Agency's {{request to the}} Allies on 6 July to bomb Auschwitz and showed the aerial reconnaissance photographs. It then examined the <b>operational</b> and technical <b>feasibility</b> aspects, in two categories: precision bombing by Mosquito-type aircraft, and area bombing by larger aircraft. It considered that precision bombing of railway lines was so common by 1944 that the Germans had specialist teams that could repair damage within hours or days. The inmates' food supplies were assumed to come by rail, and so an unrepaired railway would cause them hardship. Area bombing risked killing too many prisoners.|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{feasibility study}} of the potential application of small nuclear reactor space power systems to manned planetary surface base missions was conducted. The {{purpose of the study}} was to identify and assess the technology, performance, and safety issues associated with integration of reactor power systems with an evolutionary manned planetary surface exploration scenario. The requirements and characteristics of a variety of human-rated modular reactor power system configurations selected for a range of power levels from 25 kWe to hundreds of kilowatts is described. Trade-off analyses for reactor power systems utilizing both man-made and indigenous shielding materials are provided to examine performance, installation and <b>operational</b> safety <b>feasibility</b> issues. The results of this study have confirmed the preliminary feasibility of a wide variety of small reactor power plant configurations for growth oriented manned planetary surface exploration missions. The capability for power level growth with increasing manned presence, while maintaining safe radiation levels, was favorably assessed for nominal 25 to 100 kWe modular configurations. No feasibility limitations or technical barriers were identified and the use of both distance and indigenous planetary soil material for human rated radiation shielding were shown to be viable and attractive options...|$|R
