5|$|A fungus (plural: fungi or funguses) is {{any member}} of the group of {{eukaryotic}} organisms that includes microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as the more familiar mushrooms.

5|$|The {{history of}} {{agriculture}} records the domestication <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> and the development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively. Agriculture began independently {{in different parts of}} the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least eleven separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin.|$|E

5|$|The western painted turtle's {{consumption}} <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> changes seasonally. In early summer, 60% of its diet comprises insects. In late summer, 55% includes plants. Of note, {{the western}} painted turtle {{aids in the}} dispersal of white water-lily seeds. The turtle consumes the hard-coated seeds, which remain viable after passing through the turtle, and disperses them through its feces.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{selection}} is the intentional selection of traits {{in a population}} of organisms. This {{has been used for}} thousands of years in the domestication <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals.</b> More recently, such selection has become a vital part of genetic engineering, with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA. Proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection (for example modified enzymes and new antibodies) in a process called directed evolution.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{systems are}} studied at several {{different}} levels, from {{the scale of}} the ecology of individual organisms, to those of populations, to the ecosystems and finally the biosphere. The term population biology is often used interchangeably with population ecology, although population biology is more frequently used in the case of diseases, viruses, and microbes, while the term population ecology is more commonly applied to the study <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals.</b> Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.|$|E

5|$|Terrestrial {{habitat types}} include forests, grasslands, {{wetlands}} and deserts. Within these broad biomes are more specific habitats with varying climate types, temperature regimes, soils, altitudes and vegetation types. Many of these habitats grade {{into each other}} and each one has its own typical communities <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals.</b> A habitat may suit a particular species well, but its presence or absence at any particular location depends to some extent on chance, on its dispersal abilities and its efficiency as a coloniser.|$|E
5|$|The Great Basin, Mojave Desert, and Colorado Plateau {{converge}} at Zion and the Kolob canyons. This, {{along with}} the varied topography of canyon–mesa country, differing soil types, and uneven water availability, provides diverse habitat for the equally diverse mix <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> {{that live in the}} area. The park is home to 289 bird, 79 mammals, 28 reptiles, 7 fish, and 6 amphibian species. These organisms make their homes in one or more of four life zones found in the Park: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest.|$|E
5|$|The park's Wildlife Conservation Education Centre has {{lectures and}} video shows about {{wildlife}} and guided {{tours of the}} park and animal orphanage. These tours are primarily, but not exclusively, to educate schools and local communities. There has been criticism about animals' housing, and they now have more spacious housing in a more natural environment. The Kenya Wildlife Service has created a Safari Walk that highlights the variety <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> that are in Kenya, and how they affect Kenya's population.|$|E

5|$|The philosopher Aristotle was {{the most}} {{influential}} scholar of the living world from classical antiquity. Though his early work in natural philosophy was speculative, Aristotle's later biological writings were more empirical, focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life. He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and attributes <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> {{in the world around}} him, which he devoted considerable attention to categorizing. In all, Aristotle classified 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50. He believed that intellectual purposes, formal causes, guided all natural processes.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a wide}} {{diversity}} <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> in South India, {{resulting from}} its varied climates and geography. Deciduous forests are found along the Western Ghats while tropical dry forests and scrub lands are common in the interior Deccan plateau. The southern Western Ghats have rainforests located at high altitudes called the South Western Ghats montane rain forests and the Malabar Coast moist forests are found on the coastal plains. The Western Ghats {{is one of the}} eight hottest biodiversity hotspots in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|About 10% of Lord Howe Island's forests {{have been}} cleared for agriculture, and another 20% has been disturbed, mostly by {{domestic}} cattle and feral sheep, goats and pigs. As a result, 70% {{of the island}} remains relatively untouched with a variety <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals,</b> {{many of which are}} endemic, some of which are rare or threatened. Two species of plants, nine terrestrial birds, one bat and at least four invertebrates have become extinct since 1778. Endemism at the generic level includes the palms Howea, Hedyscepe and Lepidorrhachis, a woody daisy Lordhowea, the tree Negria, the leech Quantenobdella howensis, three annelid worm genera (Paraplutellus, Pericryptodrilus and Eastoniella), an isopod shrimp Stigmops, a hemipteran bug Howeria and a cricket Howeta.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from various {{sites on the}} Iberian peninsula suggest the domestication <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> between 6,000 and 4,500 BC. Céide Fields in Ireland, consisting of extensive tracts of land enclosed by stone walls, date to 3,500 BC and are the oldest known field systems in the world. The horse was domesticated in the Pontic steppe around 4,000 BC. In Siberia, Cannabis was in use in China in Neolithic times {{and may have been}} domesticated there; it was in use both as a fibre for ropemaking and as a medicine in Ancient Egypt by about 2,350 BC.|$|E
5|$|As {{a center}} for trade and travel between the U.S., the Caribbean, and South America, South Florida is {{especially}} vulnerable to invasive species, or species <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> that adapt aggressively to conditions in the Everglades, allowing them to reproduce faster and grow larger than they would naturally in their native environments. Approximately 26% of all species of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals in South Florida are exotic—more {{than in any other}} part of the U.S.—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world. Controlling invasive species in 1,700,000 acres (6,900km2) of infested land in South Florida costs authorities about $500 million a year.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlin was a {{prolific}} taxonomist who named over 4,000 new animal species in over 400 scientific publications. He specialized in arachnids (spiders, scorpions, and relatives) and myriapods (centipedes, millipedes, and relatives), ranking {{among the most}} prolific arachnologists and myriapodologists in history. He described over 1,400 species of spiders, 1,000 species of millipedes, {{and the majority of}} North American centipedes, although the quantity of his output was not always matched with quality, leaving a mixed legacy to his successors. He also did pioneering ethnobiological studies with the Goshute and other indigenous people of the Great Basin, cataloging indigenous names and cultural uses <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E
