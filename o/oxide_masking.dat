Under the management of Gordon E. Moore, Victor H. Grinich and Robert N.

30|$|The {{proposed}} texturization technique generated inverted pyramidal {{structure of}} etch depth 4  μm without any additional <b>oxide</b> <b>masking</b> step, which was normally needed for forming inverted pyramid structure during etching with any anisotropic etching solution. NaOCl in our proposed technique {{is a key}} material for growing in situ <b>oxide</b> <b>masking</b> layer on monocrystalline silicon (c-Si) surface during etching in NaOH–NaOCl bath. Our findings reported in this paper are based on comparative studies of optical/SEM imaging as well as FTIR spectroscopy of the c-Si sample before and after conventional NaOH and proposed NaOH–NaOCl texturization process along with the observed electrical parameters of solar cells. The comparative study of electrical parameters of the cells fabricated with conventional NaOH-IPA and the proposed cells brings out a significant improvement of parameters for solar cells. Open circuit voltage of 621.4  mV and a fill factor as high as 0.78 were the parameters achieved {{as a key for}} the high efficiency of (~ 16  %) crystalline silicon solar cell of area (125  mm ×  125  mm) compared to conventional NaOH-IPA approach due to its additional surface contaminant removal behavior. Moreover, FTIR analysis indicated that the Si–Cl bond created during texturing with NaOH–NaOCl solution finally helped in gettering during phosphorus diffusion with POCl 3 dopant. This Cl gettering helps in the improvement of open circuit voltage of a c-Si solar cell. We are probably the first group to report on such a novel idea of using NaOH–NaOCl solution for monocrystalline silicon surface texturing with formation of maskless inverted structured for solar cell fabrication of area 125  mm ×  125  mm and yield around 85  % in the conversion efficiency range 14.5 – 15.8  %, compared to 80  % yield in the efficiency range of 13.5 – 14.0  % of the conventional NaOH-IPA approach. This process can be applied as a key step to the industrial production of very large-area monocrystalline silicon solar cells.|$|E

40|$|A {{concept for}} {{integrated}} interconnected crystalline silicon thin film solar cells is presented. Following the classical thin film approach the crystalline silicon thin film {{is divided into}} individual cell stripes and interconnected monolithically, directly on the substrate. Taking advantage of the crystalline quality of the material, the interconnection is realized using screen printing pastes. In this paper we focus our experimental investigations on the separation of cell stripes and the interconnection via screen printing. The cell separation is either done by <b>oxide</b> <b>masking</b> and KOH etching or by laser ablation and a subsequent etch step. For the interconnection not only metallization pastes are required, but also an isolating material to protect {{the edge of the}} cell against shunting. Different isolating screen printing pastes were tested for their isolation properties against metallization pastes. In further experiments the influence of different firing parameters was investigated. The cell stripe width strongly affects the series resistance of the module, since it is a single side contacted concept where only the back surface field (BSF) is responsible for the electrical conductivity on the rear.

In this paper, silicon homoepitaxy growth by RTPCVD is studied extensively and comprehensively. The principles of the RTPCVD system are described, followed by results of experiments on in situ cleaning, undoped Si epitaxy on Si and silicon-on-insulator substrates, in situ doped Si epitaxy, and selective pitaxial growth of Si using <b>oxide</b> <b>masks</b> and <b>oxide</b> on polycrystalline Si on <b>oxide</b> <b>masks.</b> Selective growth was achieved without he use of HC 1.

40|$|Semiconductor {{nanowires}} are nanometre-sized structures {{offering a}} wealth of unique and novel properties affiliated with their nanoscopic dimensions and are thus being extensively studied and appraised for their potential to reshape future electronic, photonic and sensing device applications. Of great significance, are nanowire (NW) synthesis techniques providing control over position, di- mensions and quality of these nanostructures, enabling the fabrication of nanowire-based devices with reproducible and predictable performance. Specific to this work, both bottom-up and top-down approaches are developed to acquire position-controlled arrays of indium arsenide (InAs) NWs on silicon (Si) substrates. In the bottom-up approach, selective-area growth of InAs NWs is demonstrated using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on pre-patterned SiO 2 -masked silicon substrates with (111) orientation. The patterning of the <b>oxide</b> <b>mask</b> is achieved via a cost-effective bottom-up technique, termed colloidal lithography, which relies on self-assembled colloidal particles on the surface to produce large scale templates with nanohole patterns. Effects of growth parameters and <b>oxide</b> <b>mask</b> quality on the NW growth are investigated. Furthermore, a theoretical growth model is developed to explain the size scaling behavior of NWs {{as a function of}} growth time, inter-wire spacing and growth temperature. This model calls attention to the presence of three growth regimes governing the NW growth kinetics depending on inter-wire distance. The top-down approach for the synthesis of in-plane NWs presented in this work relies on the patterning of high-quality epitaxial InAs thin films. The wires are obtained via wet chemical etching of InAs through a resist serving as an etch mask.

However, incorrect use and disposal may actually {{increase the risk of}} pathogen transmission, rather than reduce it, especially when masks are used by non-professionals such as the lay public. Copper oxide displays potent antiviral properties. A platform technology has been developed that permanently introduces copper oxide into polymeric materials, conferring them with potent biocidal properties. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We demonstrate that impregnation of copper oxide into respiratory protective face masks endows them with potent biocidal properties in addition to their inherent filtration properties. Both control and copper <b>oxide</b> impregnated <b>masks</b> filtered above 99. 85 % of aerosolized viruses when challenged with 5. 66 +/- 0. 51 and 6. 17 +/- 0. 37 log(10) TCID(50) of human influenza A virus (H 1 N 1) and avian influenza virus (H 9 N 2), respectively, under simulated breathing conditions (28. 3 L/min). Importantly, no infectious human influenza A viral titers were recovered from the copper <b>oxide</b> containing <b>masks</b> within 30 minutes (< or = 0. 88 log(10) TCID(50)), while 4. 67 +/- 1. 35 log(10) TCID(50) were recovered from the control masks.

40|$|A nano-layer {{of silicon}} <b>oxide</b> <b>mask</b> with {{inducing}} windows was prepared on a-Si. The inducing windows pre-defined the crystalline nucleation positions. The morphology of the resulted MMIC poly-Si {{depends on the}} width of the inducing windows, the thickness of silicon oxide outside the inducing windows, and the area density of the nickel inducing medium. Poly-Si composed of continuous zonal domain (CZD) in the same width was obtained under optimal conditions. In this case, metal induced nucleation took place in some isolated sites inside the inducing windows, the crystallization of a-Si proceeded around those isolated nuclei along radial direction inside the inducing windows, and then along radial or lateral direction outside the inducing windows. P-channel CZD poly-Si TFTs exhibited a field effect mobility (μ FE) of ∼ 65 cm 2 /V•s, a subthreshold swing (S) of 0. 56 V/dec, a threshold voltage (Vth) of - 3. 5 V, and a ratio of on-state to off-state drain currents of 2. 6 × 10 7. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
