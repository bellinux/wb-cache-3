40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to enhance {{competitiveness}} of hotel complex management in the <b>hotel</b> <b>service</b> market {{of the state of}} Côte d'Ivoire. The objectives of this study are: 1) producing a model of oligopoly market of <b>hotel</b> <b>services</b> based on marketing research; 2) synthesis of the conflict-optimum management method of a hotel complex using the model of oligopoly market of hotel services; 3) study of issues on competitiveness enhancement of running hotel complex in the market of oligopoly under counter-conditions of <b>other</b> <b>hotel</b> complexes. To obtain the result the paper offers to use techniques of classical and modern theory of management, namely methods of the theory of optimal management of multi-object multicriteria systems, methods of game theory, methods of system analysis, operations research and decision-making. The paper proposes a model of the oligopoly market for interaction of hotels in the hospitality services in Stackelberg’s form in which, as the "governing" parameters, a hotel complex has the accommodation cost in the selected category and the advertising cost. Monthly income of the hotel complex is proposed as an indicator of the efficiency. Evaluation of success in the market is based on the indicator of competitiveness. To solve the problem of multi-criteria optimization the paper offers a method of conflictoptimum competitiveness management of hotel complexes. It considers a model example of the interaction between two complexes in the market of duopoly. It is concluded {{that in the case of}} a saturated demand for the <b>services</b> of <b>hotel</b> complexes, there is a guaranteed Nash solution, which ensures a certain profit regardless of the actions of another hotel complex. In the case of unsaturated demand (lack of customers) in the market there is no guaranteed solution, which is a prerequisite for entry into agreement between the market players. The model obtained can be useful for observing trends in the market of <b>hotel</b> <b>services.</b> </p...|$|R
