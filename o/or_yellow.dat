5|$|The term wasp is {{sometimes}} used more narrowly for the Vespidae, {{which includes the}} common wasp <b>or</b> <b>yellow</b> jacket genera Vespula and Dolichovespula and the hornets, Vespa; or simply for the common wasp and close lookalikes.|$|E
5|$|The weavers {{are small}} {{passerine}} birds {{related to the}} finches. They are seed-eating birds with rounded conical bills. The males of many species are brightly colored, usually in red <b>or</b> <b>yellow</b> and black. Some species show variation in color only in the breeding season. One species has been recorded in South Carolina.|$|E

5|$|A small prickly leaved shrub between 0.2 and 3m (8 in to 10ft) high, G. juniperina grows {{generally}} on clay-based or alluvial soils in eucalypt woodland. The flower heads, {{known as}} inflorescences, appear from winter to early summer and are red, orange <b>or</b> <b>yellow.</b> Birds visit and pollinate the flowers. Grevillea juniperina plants {{are killed by}} bushfire, regenerating afterwards from seed. Grevillea juniperina adapts readily to cultivation and has been important in horticulture {{as it is the}} parent of many popular garden hybrids.|$|E
5|$|All {{those lines}} are labeled as N3 and N2 optical centers and {{associated}} with a defect consisting of three nitrogen atoms bordering a vacancy. Other stones show additional bands: brown, green, <b>or</b> <b>yellow</b> diamonds show a band in the green at 504nm (H3 center, see above), sometimes accompanied by two additional weak bands at 537nm and 495nm (H4 center, a large complex presumably involving 4 substitutional nitrogen atoms and 2 lattice vacancies). Type IIb diamonds may absorb in the far red due to the substitutional boron, but otherwise show no observable visible absorption spectrum.|$|E

This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
5|$|Banksia prionotes occurs {{throughout}} much of the Southwest Botanical Province, occurring both along the west coast and well inland, and ranging from Shark Bay (25°30′S) in the north, to Kojonup (33°50'S) and Jerramungup (34°24'S 118°55'E) in the south and south-east respectively. It grows among tall shrubland or low woodland, mostly in the swales and lower slopes of dunes, and shows a very strong preference for deep white <b>or</b> <b>yellow</b> sand.|$|E
5|$|HD 2039 is {{a yellow}} dwarf <b>or</b> <b>yellow</b> subgiant {{star in the}} {{constellation}} Phoenix. The star is not {{visible to the naked}} eye, and lies approximately 330 light years away from the Sun. HD 2039 is a relatively stable star, and an exoplanet at least three times the mass of the planet Jupiter has been discovered in its orbit; this exoplanet, known as HD 2039 b, was the 100th exoplanet to be discovered.|$|E

5|$|Member {{species are}} usually annuals or {{herbaceous}} perennials. Flowers are red, pink, <b>or</b> <b>yellow,</b> often in various combinations. A {{large number of}} the Erythranthe species grow in moist to wet soils with some growing even in shallow water. They are not very drought resistant, {{but many of the}} species now classified as Diplacus are. Species are found at elevations from oceanside to high mountains as well as a wide variety of climates, though most prefer wet areas such as riverbanks.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches are monogamous. The female {{produces}} {{eggs that}} are white with red <b>or</b> <b>yellow</b> markings; the clutch size varies, tending {{to be larger}} for northern species. The eggs are incubated for 12 to 18 days by the female alone, or by both parents, depending on the species. The altricial (naked and helpless) chicks take between 21 and 27 days to fledge. Both parents feed the young, {{and in the case}} of two American species, brown-headed and pygmy, helper males from the previous brood may assist the parents in feeding.|$|E
5|$|Ritter von Laurin, the Austrian {{consul-general}} in Egypt, {{was able}} to inspect a fragment of the Stone removed by Muhammad Ali in 1817 and reported {{that it had a}} pitch-black exterior and a silver-grey, fine-grained interior in which tiny cubes of a bottle-green material were embedded. There are reportedly a few white <b>or</b> <b>yellow</b> spots {{on the face of the}} Stone, and it is officially described as being white with the exception of the face.|$|E

5|$|Tetravalent thorium {{compounds}} {{are usually}} colourless <b>or</b> <b>yellow,</b> {{like those of}} silver or lead, as the Th4+ ion has no 5f or 6d electrons. Thorium chemistry is therefore largely that of an electropositive metal forming a single diamagnetic ion with a stable noble-gas configuration, indicating a similarity between thorium and the main group elements of the s-block. Thorium and uranium are the most investigated of the radioactive elements because their radioactivity is low enough not to require special handling in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The Utila iguana has a grey-brown {{to black}} {{coloring}} when young, the only species of spiny-tail iguana {{with such a}} dark color when young. Other members of the genus have a green <b>or</b> <b>yellow</b> coloring when young and turn darker with age. As this animal matures {{it can be a}} blue or light gray in color, depending on heat conditions or even the animal's temper.|$|E
5|$|The corms of the {{tuberous}} sundews {{native to}} Australia {{are considered a}} delicacy by the Australian Aborigines. Some of these corms were also used to dye textiles, while another purple <b>or</b> <b>yellow</b> dye was traditionally prepared in the Scottish Highlands using D. rotundifolia. A sundew liqueur is also still produced using a recipe from the 14th century. It is made using fresh leaves from mainly D. capensis, D. spatulata, and D. rotundifolia.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that color}} {{variations}} with more <b>or</b> less <b>yellow,</b> <b>or</b> pink instead of <b>yellow</b> <b>or</b> black, are not exceptional, especially in Bewick's swans, which very rarely {{may even have}} yellowish feet. The small size and particularly the rather short neck, which {{make it look like}} a large white goose, are still distinguishing marks.|$|R
50|$|Helianthus porteri {{grows on}} granite hillsides. It is an annual herb up to 100 cm (40 inches) tall. One plant usually {{produces}} 5 or more flower heads, each containing 7 <b>or</b> 8 <b>yellow</b> ray florets surrounding 30 <b>or</b> more <b>yellow</b> disc florets.|$|R
