40|$|Abstract. Customers {{everywhere}} demand better {{products or}} services quicker with improved cost control and responsiveness. Concurrently, they demand continuity of supply and more involvement with suppliers and others to provide unexpected results. The key concept making this all possible is to significantly reduce waste and its costs. This presentation shows how managing the seven types <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> holds great potential to improve supply chain operations, reduce cycle time, control costs and enhance quality and process productivity. We will identify seven types <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> and establish ways to quickly eliminate or significantly reduce waste and costs. We will look at several processes that can quickly help an organization control or eliminate waste and its subsequent costs. These synergistic processes must involve our suppliers and {{their support for the}} program. We will learn to evaluate existing procedures, extend the range of knowledge concerning lean operations along with supplier relations and cost control and to consider new ideas concerning change. Eliminating waste and cost is the goal and we get there by being lean. Objectives. Participants in this workshop will understand these concepts. That their operations include and hide waste everywhere. That lean operations reduce the forms <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> from any operation. That eliminating waste maximizes value for our customers, our workforce and our <b>owners.</b> Types <b>of</b> <b>Waste.</b> There are many lists <b>of</b> <b>waste,</b> but I like and use this list developed by Professor Rajan Suri.

40|$|In September 2006, {{an adult}} truck driver {{employed}} by a trucking company sustained fatal injuries after being buried by mulch in his trailer {{at a town}} solid waste site. At {{the time of the}} incident, the victim’s tractor trailer was being loaded with mulch. The trailer was equipped with a walking floor unloading system. After the town loader operator deposited one bucket of approximately five cubic yards of mulch into the trailer, he noticed that the trailer door was open and the victim was not in the cab. The operator became concerned and called for help. One town staff member called 911. In the meantime, town workers started digging into the compost pile in the trailer. The temperature of the mulch was approximately 135 degrees Fahrenheit. The police arrived at the site followed by paramedics within minutes after the 911 call was placed. The unconscious victim was uncovered 15 minutes later. The victim was transported to a hospital and subsequently {{died as a result of}} the injuries.
