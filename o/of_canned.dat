5|$|Accounts vary, but historians {{estimate}} that by spring 1903, between 700 and 1,000 men {{arrived in the}} Tanana Valley. This put an enormous strain on Barnette's stock of food, which rapidly rose in price with demand. Miners objected to Barnette charging $12 per bag of flour and requiring them to buy cases <b>of</b> <b>canned</b> food. They gathered outside his store and demanded he lower his prices or they would burn it down. He responded that he had riflemen inside the building, and both groups reached a compromise. Shortly afterward, Barnette headed south with his wife on a dog team, intending to gather investors to purchase more supplies.|$|E
5|$|As at Oak Ridge, {{the most}} {{difficulty}} was encountered while canning the uranium slugs, which commenced at Hanford in March 1944. They were pickled to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and aluminum-silicon alloy, canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using arc welding under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they {{were subjected to}} a series of tests to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output of only a handful <b>of</b> <b>canned</b> slugs per day. But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased {{to the point where it}} appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start Reactor B on schedule in August 1944.|$|E
5|$|Even though Agatha passed {{close to}} Mexico as it weakened, no impact {{is known to}} have been caused. Waves caused by Agatha did impact a ship called the Polynesian Diakan. A Greek {{freighter}} en route from Pago Pago to Terminal Island, California, the Polynesian Diakan began flooding on June 3, forcing the 32-man crew to abandon the vessel. The exact cause of the initial flooding was unknown, but was speculated to be primarily due to cargo shifting and not the weather. The crew was rescued by the United States Coast Guard. Three members required hospitalization. After being reached on June 6 by a tugboat in a salvage attempt, the vessel capsized and sank near San Clemente Island on June 7, taking its multimillion-dollar cargo of 71 containers <b>of</b> <b>canned</b> tuna with it. The reason for the sinking was unknown.|$|E

5|$|In the {{preparation}} of bean dip, various types of beans can be used, including black beans, pinto beans, kidney beans, white beans, fava beans, lima beans and edamame, a preparation of immature soybeans in the pod. Some bean dips incorporate several bean varieties into the dish, such as three-bean dip. Raw beans that are soaked and cooked are used, as are prepared canned beans and refried beans. The use <b>of</b> <b>canned</b> beans {{can result in a}} creamier dip, because beans prepared in canneries are pressure cooked in the can. Canned beans may have a salty flavor, which can be reduced by rinsing and then draining them. Fresh cooked beans may contribute to a more flavorful dish compared to using canned beans. Prepared canned green chili peppers are also sometimes used as a main ingredient.|$|E

Mikoyan spent three months in the United States, where he not only learned more about its food industry but also met and spoke with Henry Ford and inspected Macy's in New York. When he returned, Mikoyan introduced a number of popular American consumer products to the Soviet Union, including American hamburgers, ice cream, corn flakes, popcorn, tomato juice, grapefruit, and corn on the cob.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the role <b>of</b> calcineurin (<b>CaN)</b> in {{the pathogenesis of}} stress-related psychiatric disorders, we examined the expression <b>of</b> <b>CaN</b> A mRNA and the serine/threonine phosphatase activity <b>of</b> <b>CaN</b> in the rat brain following various restraint stress paradigms. Northern blot analysis revealed no {{significant changes in the}} levels <b>of</b> <b>CaN</b> A mRNA expression, in either the frontal cortex or the hippocampus, in response to a single restraint stress for either 15, 45, or 90 min. In addition, no significant change in the levels <b>of</b> <b>CaN</b> A mRNA was found 3 or 6 h after a single restraint stress for 90 min. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that a single restraint stress for 45 min had no influence on CaN A mRNA expression in the CA 1 and CA 3 pyramidal cell layers or in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer of the hippocampus. However, serine/threonine phosphatase activity was significantly increased in both regions in response to a single restraint stress for either 45 or 90 min. These results demonstrate that the single restraint stress paradigms used in this study increase the activity <b>of</b> <b>CaN</b> without any changes in the expression <b>of</b> <b>CaN,</b> suggesting that the activation of calmodulin and the increased levels of heat shock proteins in response to the restraint stress may upregulate the activity <b>of</b> <b>CaN</b> in the rat brain. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Background. Chronic {{allograft}} nephropathy (CAN) {{belongs to}} the major causes of long-term kidney allograft failure. One of the histologic hallmarks <b>of</b> <b>CAN</b> is interstitial fibrosis, influenced by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that are controlling extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Whether MMPs affect the development and progression <b>of</b> <b>CAN</b> is not clear so far. To analyze the role <b>of</b> MMps in <b>CAN,</b> we investigated the effects of an early and a late application of BAY 12 - 9566, an inhibitor of MMP- 2, - 3, and - 9 on the development and progression <b>of</b> <b>CAN</b> in a rat kidneytransplantation model. Methods. Fisher kidneys were orthotopically transplanted into Lewis recipients that were treated with BAY 12 - 9566 (15 mg/kg per day) or vehicle either for the first 10 days after transplantation (early treatment) or from week 12 to week 20 after transplantation (late treatment). Proteinuria was analyzed every 4 weeks up to week 20 after transplantation when kidney grafts were removed for further analysis. Results. Early MMP-inhibition resulted in a significantly reduced 24 -hour protein excretion that was paralleled by a lower grade <b>of</b> <b>CAN</b> after 20 weeks. However, late MMP inhibition starting at week 12 after transplantation resulted in significantly higher proteinuria and a higher grade <b>of</b> <b>CAN</b> as compared with controls. Furthermore, transforming growth factor-beta and platelet- derived growth factor-B chain mRNA levels were significantly increased in these animals. Conclusions. Inhibition of MMPs early after transplantation reduced the development and progression <b>of</b> <b>CAN</b> but promoted CAN if initiated at later stages. Thus, MMI's {{are involved in the}} development and progression <b>of</b> <b>CAN...</b>|$|R
