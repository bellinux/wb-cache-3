5|$|An {{association}} between viruses and <b>obesity</b> {{has been found}} in humans and several different animal species. The amount that these associations {{may have contributed to the}} rising rate of <b>obesity</b> is yet to be determined.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{physical}} and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk of <b>obesity.</b> Medical illnesses that increase <b>obesity</b> risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) {{as well as some}} congenital or acquired conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, and the eating disorders: binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome. However, <b>obesity</b> is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness. The risk of overweight and <b>obesity</b> is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders.|$|E
5|$|Comprehensive {{approaches}} are {{being looked at}} to address the rising rates of <b>obesity.</b> The <b>Obesity</b> Policy Action (OPA) framework divides measure into 'upstream' policies, 'midstream' policies, 'downstream' policies. 'Upstream' policies look at changing society, 'midstream' policies try to alter individuals' behavior to prevent <b>obesity,</b> and 'downstream' policies try to treat currently afflicted people.|$|E
5|$|It is {{anticipated}} that rates of OHS will rise as {{the prevalence of}} <b>obesity</b> rises. This may also explain why OHS is more commonly reported in the United States, where <b>obesity</b> is more common than in other countries.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the risk}} factors for endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to <b>obesity.</b> In <b>obesity,</b> the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. <b>Obesity</b> also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as <b>obesity.</b> Specifically, <b>obesity,</b> typeII diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for TypeI endometrial cancer. <b>Obesity</b> increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.|$|E
5|$|<b>Obesity</b> and {{metabolic}} syndrome are both {{closely related to}} plasma triglyceride levels. Therefore, the focus on an association between APOA5 and BMI or {{metabolic syndrome}} is understandable. Available studies show that minor APOA5 alleles could be associated with an enhanced risk of <b>obesity</b> or metabolic syndrome development. However, genome wide studies have failed to prove that APOA5 is a gene associated with BMI values and/or <b>obesity,</b> so the effect could be far from clinically significant or at least significantly context-dependent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Obesity</b> in pets {{is common}} in many countries. In the United States, 23–41% of dogs are overweight, and about 5.1% are obese. The rate of <b>obesity</b> in cats was {{slightly}} higher at 6.4%. In Australia the rate of <b>obesity</b> among dogs in a veterinary setting {{has been found to}} be 7.6%. The risk of <b>obesity</b> in dogs is related to whether or not their owners are obese; however, there is no similar correlation between cats and their owners.|$|E
5|$|<b>Obesity</b> is {{a leading}} {{preventable}} cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2015, 600 million adults (12%) and 100 million children were obese. <b>Obesity</b> {{is more common in}} women than men. Authorities view it {{as one of the most}} serious public health problems of the 21stcentury. <b>Obesity</b> is stigmatized in much of the modern world (particularly in the Western world), though it was seen as a symbol of wealth and fertility at other times in history and still is in some parts of the world. In 2013, the American Medical Association classified <b>obesity</b> as a disease.|$|E
5|$|<b>Obesity</b> {{prevention}} {{programs have been}} found to reduce the cost of treating obesity-related disease. However, the longer people live, the more medical costs they incur. Researchers, therefore, conclude that reducing <b>obesity</b> may improve the public's health, but it is unlikely to reduce overall health spending.|$|E
5|$|Out of all dog breeds {{it is the}} Labrador Retriever that is {{most likely}} to obese. This <b>obesity</b> has been {{attributed}} to a specific gene mutation. See the <b>Obesity</b> sub section below.|$|E
5|$|The healthy BMI range {{varies with}} the age and sex of the child. <b>Obesity</b> in {{children}} and adolescents is defined as a BMI greater than the 95thpercentile. The reference data that these percentiles are based on is from 1963 to 1994 and thus has not been affected by the recent increases in rates of <b>obesity.</b> Childhood <b>obesity</b> has reached epidemic proportions in the 21stcentury, with rising rates in both the developed and the developing world. Rates of <b>obesity</b> in Canadian boys have increased from 11% in the 1980s to over 30% in the 1990s, while during this same time period rates increased from 4 to 14% in Brazilian children.|$|E
5|$|The rate of <b>obesity</b> also {{increases}} with age at least up to 50 or 60years old and severe <b>obesity</b> in the United States, Australia, and Canada is increasing {{faster than the}} overall rate of <b>obesity.</b>|$|E
5|$|A BMI of ≥ 35kg/m2 and {{experiencing}} obesity-related health conditions or ≥40–44.9kg/m2 is morbid <b>obesity.</b>|$|E
5|$|A BMI of ≥ 45 or 50kg/m2 is super <b>obesity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the {{negative}} health consequences of <b>obesity</b> {{in the general}} population are well supported by the available evidence, health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to be improved at an increased BMI, a phenomenon known as the <b>obesity</b> survival paradox. The paradox was first described in 1999 in overweight and obese people undergoing hemodialysis, and has subsequently been found in those with heart failure and peripheral artery disease (PAD).|$|E
5|$|Any BMI ≥ 35 or 40kg/m2 is severe <b>obesity.</b>|$|E
5|$|As with <b>obesity</b> in adults, {{many factors}} {{contribute}} to the rising rates of childhood <b>obesity.</b> Changing diet and decreasing physical activity {{are believed to be}} the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child <b>obesity.</b> Because childhood <b>obesity</b> often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver. Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group. Multi-component behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although the benefits are small and quality of evidence is low.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion, {{when used}} for {{treating}} <b>obesity</b> {{over a period}} of 6 to 12 months, may result in weight loss of 2.7kg over placebo. This is not much different from the weight loss produced by several other medications, such as sibutramine or orlistat. It has been studied in combination with naltrexone. Concerns from bupropion include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. In September 2014, a combination (bupropion/naltrexone) was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of <b>obesity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Complications {{are either}} {{directly}} caused by <b>obesity</b> or indirectly related through mechanisms sharing {{a common cause}} such as a poor diet or a sedentary lifestyle. The strength {{of the link between}} <b>obesity</b> and specific conditions varies. One of the strongest is the link with type 2 diabetes. Excess body fat underlies 64% of cases of diabetes in men and 77% of cases in women.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the medical}} costs {{attributable}} to <b>obesity</b> in the US were an estimated $190.2billion or 20.6% of all medical expenditures, while {{the cost of}} <b>obesity</b> in Canada was estimated at CA$2 billion in 1997 (2.4% of total health costs). The total annual direct cost of overweight and <b>obesity</b> in Australia in 2005 was A$21 billion. Overweight and obese Australians also received A$35.6 billion in government subsidies. The estimate range for annual expenditures on diet products is $40billion to $100billion in the US alone.|$|E
5|$|Increasing <b>obesity</b> in the United States {{and health}} {{improvements}} elsewhere contributed to lowering the country's rank in life expectancy from 11th {{in the world}} in 1987, to 42nd in 2007. <b>Obesity</b> rates have more than doubled in the last 30 years, are the highest in the industrialized world, and are among the highest anywhere. Approximately one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight. Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered epidemic by health care professionals.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a healthy}} breed with {{relatively}} few major problems. Notable issues related to health and well-being include inherited disorders and <b>obesity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{cultures}} {{throughout history}} have viewed <b>obesity</b> {{as the result}} of a character flaw. The obesus or fat character in Ancient Greek comedy was a glutton and figure of mockery. During Christian times the food was viewed as a gateway to the sins of sloth and lust. In modern Western culture, excess weight is often regarded as unattractive, and <b>obesity</b> is commonly associated with various negative stereotypes. People of all ages can face social stigmatization, and may be targeted by bullies or shunned by their peers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Obesity</b> {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as {{a risk factor for}} venous thrombosis. It more than doubles the risk in numerous studies, particularly in combination with the use of oral contraceptives or in the period after surgery. Various coagulation abnormalities have been described in the obese. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is present in higher levels in people with <b>obesity.</b> Obese people also have larger numbers of circulating microvesicles (fragments of damaged cells) that bear tissue factor. Platelet aggregation may be increased, and there are higher levels of coagulation proteins such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VII and factor VIII. <b>Obesity</b> also increases the risk of recurrence after an initial episode of thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Obesity</b> {{is still}} {{seen as a}} sign of wealth and {{well-being}} in many parts of Africa. This has become particularly common since the HIV epidemic began.|$|E
5|$|Oklahomans are in {{the upper}} half of Americans in terms of <b>obesity</b> prevalence, and the state is the 5th most obese in the nation, with 30.3 percent of its {{population}} at or near <b>obesity.</b> Oklahoma ranked last among the 50 states in a 2007 study by the Commonwealth Fund on health care performance.|$|E
5|$|The International Size Acceptance Association (ISAA) is a {{non-governmental}} organization (NGO) {{which was founded}} in 1997. It has more of a global orientation and describes its mission as promoting size acceptance and helping to end weight-based discrimination. These groups often argue for the recognition of <b>obesity</b> as a disability under the US Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). The American legal system, however, has decided that the potential public health costs exceed the benefits of extending this anti-discrimination law to cover <b>obesity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The exact {{prevalence}} of <b>obesity</b> hypoventilation syndrome is unknown, {{and it is}} thought that many people with symptoms of OHS have not been diagnosed. About a third of all people with morbid <b>obesity</b> (a body mass index exceeding 40 kg/m2) have elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} treatment for <b>obesity</b> is bariatric surgery. The types of procedures include laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, vertical-sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion. Surgery for severe <b>obesity</b> {{is associated with}} long-term weight loss, improvement in <b>obesity</b> related conditions, and decreased overall mortality. One study found a weight loss of between 14% and 25% (depending {{on the type of}} procedure performed) at 10years, and a 29% reduction in all cause mortality when compared to standard weight loss measures. Complications occur in about 17% of cases and reoperation is needed in 7% of cases. Due to its cost and risks, researchers are searching for other effective yet less invasive treatments including devices that occupy space in the stomach.|$|E
5|$|While genetic {{influences}} {{are important}} to understanding <b>obesity,</b> they cannot explain the current dramatic increase seen within specific countries or globally. Though it is accepted that energy consumption in excess of energy expenditure leads to <b>obesity</b> on an individual basis, {{the cause of the}} shifts in these two factors on the societal scale is much debated. There are a number of theories as to the cause but most believe it is a combination of various factors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Obesity</b> is an {{increasingly}} common problem in dogs in Western countries. As with humans, <b>obesity</b> can cause numerous health problems in dogs (although dogs {{are much less}} susceptible to the common cardiac and arterial consequences of <b>obesity</b> than humans are). According to {{a study published in}} the Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine, the prevalence of <b>obesity</b> in dogs is between 22 and 40 percent.|$|E
25|$|France—like other rich countries—faces an {{increasing}} and recent epidemic of <b>obesity,</b> due {{mostly to the}} replacement in French eating habits of traditional healthy French cuisine by junk food. The French <b>obesity</b> rate is still far below that of the USA (for instance, <b>obesity</b> rate in France {{is the same as}} the US had in the 1970s), and is still the lowest of Europe. Authorities now regard <b>obesity</b> as one of the main public health issues and fight it fiercely. Rates of childhood <b>obesity</b> are slowing in France, while continuing to grow in other countries.|$|E
25|$|Management of <b>obesity</b> {{can include}} {{lifestyle}} changes, medications, or surgery. The main treatment for <b>obesity</b> consists of dieting and physical exercise.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{intervention}} for psychological treatment of childhood <b>obesity</b> {{has become more}} prevalent in recent years. A meta-analysis of the psychological treatment of <b>obesity</b> {{in children and adolescents}} found family-based behavioral treatment (FBT) and Parent-Only Behavior treatment to be the most effective practices in treating <b>obesity</b> in children within a psychological framework.|$|E
25|$|Another {{class of}} miRNAs that {{regulate}} insulin resistance, <b>obesity,</b> and diabetes, is the let-7 family. Let-7 accumulates in human tissues {{during the course}} of aging. When let-7 was ectopically overexpressed to mimic accelerated aging, mice became insulin-resistant, and thus more prone to high fat diet-induced <b>obesity</b> and diabetes. In contrast when let-7 was inhibited by injections of let-7-specific antagomirs, mice become more insulin-sensitive and remarkably resistant to high fat diet-induced <b>obesity</b> and diabetes. Not only could let-7 inhibition prevent <b>obesity</b> and diabetes, it could also reverse and cure the condition. These experimental findings suggest that let-7 inhibition could represent a new therapy for <b>obesity</b> and type 2 diabetes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Obesity</b> {{rates in}} Israel are below {{the average for}} Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations, with an <b>obesity</b> rate of 14% for adults in 2009.|$|E
