500|$|Brown was {{the first}} Prime Minister from a Scottish {{constituency}} since the Conservative Sir Alec Douglas-Home in 1964. Not all British prime ministers have attended university, but <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> did Brown {{was one of only}} five that did not attend either Oxford or Cambridge, the others were, Lord Bute (Leiden), Lord John Russell (Edinburgh), Bonar Law (Glasgow), and Neville Chamberlain (Mason Science College, later Birmingham). Brown proposed moving some traditional prime ministerial powers conferred by royal prerogative to the realm of Parliament, such as the power to declare war and approve appointments to senior positions. Brown wanted Parliament to gain the right to ratify treaties and have more oversight into the intelligence services. He also proposed moving some powers from Parliament to citizens, including the right to form [...] "citizens' juries", easily petition Parliament for new laws, and rally outside Westminster. He asserted that the attorney general should {{not have the right to}} decide whether to prosecute in individual cases, such as in the loans for peerages scandal.|$|E
500|$|The Browns {{reached the}} NFL {{championship}} game in 1951 and 1952, but lost both times. Speedie led the NFL in receiving in 1951 {{and was named}} a first-team All Pro, {{but he did not}} play in the championship game due to an injury. He was selected for the Pro Bowl for a second time in 1952. After that season, however, he left the Browns to join the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Western Interprovincial Football Union under acrimonious circumstances. Speedie had an independent streak that did not sit well with Brown, whose domineering coaching style grated against many of the men who played for him. [...] "He was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> Paul Brown picked on quite a bit", recalled former teammate Ken Carpenter. [...] "He'd get on Speedie's case for no particular reason." [...] Speedie showed his displeasure by bringing a skunk to training camp in 1952 and calling it [...] "Paul". Brown told Speedie he did not think it was very funny, to which Speedie responded that it was a nocturnal animal and was named after Paul Revere.|$|E

500|$|On July 5, {{with the}} Indians in Chicago {{in the midst}} of a road trip, Doby made his debut as the second black {{baseball}} player after Robinson to play in the majors after establishment of the baseball color line. Veeck hired two plainclothes police officers to accompany Doby as he went to Comiskey Park. Player-manager Lou Boudreau initially had a hard time finding a place in the lineup for Doby, who had played second base and shortstop for most of his career. Boudreau himself was the regular shortstop, while Joe Gordon was the second baseman. That day, Doby met his new teammates for the first time. [...] "I walked down that line, stuck out my hand, and very few hands came back in return. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> did were cold-fish handshakes, along with a look that said, 'You don't belong here", Doby reminisced years later. Four of Doby's teammates did not shake his hand, and of those, two turned their backs to Doby when he tried to introduce himself. During warm-ups, Doby languished for minutes while his teammates interacted with one another. Not until Joe Gordon asked Doby to play catch with him was Doby given the chance to engage. Gordon befriended Doby and became one of his closest friends on the team.|$|E
500|$|While {{moving through}} the stages, the player {{encounters}} many monsters, and is forced to battle against them using {{one of their own}} monsters in a puzzle battle based on Bejeweled Twist. The creatures are [...] "variations on fantasy archetypes" [...] and include demons, giant spiders, giant frogs, and beasts inspired by Dungeons & Dragons. The player can only bring three creatures into a stage out of all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> they have, and selects one of the three when a battle begins. A grid of different colored gems is displayed, and the player can select blocks of four jewels and rotate them clockwise. If a line of three or more identical gems is formed, the gems disappear, allowing all of the jewels above the now-vacant spaces in the grid to fall down a row to replace them. New gems appear {{at the top of the}} screen to fill any holes in the grid. If new lines of gems are formed from this movement, the process repeats. Whenever lines are formed, a gauge is filled slightly for the player; when it is full a special gem appears on the board. When that gem is formed into a line, damage is done to the enemy. The enemy also has a gauge, which is filled every time the player performs a rotation, and damage is dealt directly to the player when it is filled.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 880s or early 890s Alfred issued a long domboc or law code {{consisting}} of his [...] "own" [...] laws, {{followed by a}} code issued by his late seventh-century predecessor King Ine of Wessex. Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters. In his introduction Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many [...] "synod-books" [...] and [...] "ordered to be written many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> our forefathers observed—those that pleased me; and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> did not please me, I rejected with the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way".|$|E

2500|$|Hadza is a {{language}} isolate (Sands 1998, Starostin 2013). It was once classified by many linguists as a Khoisan language, {{along with its}} neighbor Sandawe, primarily because they both have click consonants. However, Hadza has very few proposed cognates with either Sandawe or the other Khoisan languages, and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> have been proposed appear doubtful. The links with Sandawe, for example, are Cushitic loan words, whereas the links with southern Africa are so few and so short (usually single consonant–vowel syllables) that they are most likely coincidental. A few words link it with Oropom, which may itself be spurious; the numerals itchâme 'one' and pie 'two' suggest a connection with Kw'adza, an extinct language of hunter-gatherers who may have had recently shifted to Cushitic. (Higher numerals were borrowed in both languages.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, Martin van Creveld {{concluded}} that {{a study of the}} practical aspects of the Schlieffen Plan was difficult, {{because of a lack of}} information. The consumption of food and ammunition at times and places are unknown, as are the quantity and loading of trains moving through Belgium, the state of repair of railway stations and data about the supplies which reached the front-line troops. Creveld thought that Schlieffen had paid little attention to supply matters, understanding the difficulties but trusting to luck, rather than concluding that such an operation was impractical. Schlieffen was able to predict the railway demolitions carried out in Belgium, naming some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> caused the worst delays in 1914. Schlieffen's assumption that the armies could live off the land was proved correct. Under Moltke (the Younger) much was done to remedy the supply deficiencies in German war planning, studies being written and training being conducted in the unfashionable [...] "technics" [...] of warfare. Moltke (the Younger) introduced motorised transport companies, which were invaluable in the 1914 campaign; in supply matters, the changes made by Moltke to the concepts established by Schlieffen were for the better.|$|E
2500|$|David Stove's {{argument}} for induction, {{based on the}} statistical syllogism, was presented in the Rationality of Induction and was developed from an argument put forward by one of Stove's heroes, the late Donald Cary Williams (formerly Professor at Harvard) in his book The Ground of Induction. Stove argued {{that it is a}} statistical truth that the great majority of the possible subsets of specified size (as long as this size is not too small) are similar to the larger population to which they belong. For example, the majority of the subsets which contain 3000 ravens which you can form from the raven population are similar to the population itself (and this applies no matter how large the raven population is, {{as long as it is}} not infinite). Consequently, Stove argued that if you find yourself with such a subset then the chances are that this subset is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> are similar to the population, and so you are justified in concluding that it is likely that this subset [...] "matches" [...] the population reasonably closely. The situation would be analogous to drawing a ball out of a barrel of balls, 99% of which are red. In such a case you have a 99% chance of drawing a red ball. Similarly, when getting a sample of ravens the probability is very high that the sample is one of the matching or [...] "representative" [...] ones. So as long as you have no reason to think that your sample is an unrepresentative one, you are justified in thinking that probably (although not certainly) that it is.|$|E
