5|$|Individuals {{looking to}} become {{forensic}} anthropologists first obtain a bachelor's degree in anthropology from an accredited university. During their studies they {{should focus on}} physical anthropology as well as <b>osteology.</b> In addition {{it is recommended that}} individuals take courses {{in a wide range of}} sciences such as biology, chemistry, anatomy, and genetics.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} finds, many other Megalosaurus bones have been recovered; however, no {{complete}} skeleton {{has yet been}} found. Therefore, the details of its physical appearance cannot be certain. However, a full <b>osteology</b> of all known material was published in 2010 by Benson.|$|E
5|$|However, other taxonomists {{challenged}} {{the validity of}} the species as early as 1939, noting that the Lānai hookbill was only known from one specimen and arguing that it was merely an aberrant and partially albino female ōū. The hookbill's validity was not confirmed until 1989 when the specimen's skull was removed and examined. The bird's cranial <b>osteology,</b> myology, plumage, and bill morphology confirmed the distinctness of the species.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} tools {{forensic}} anthropologists use {{in the identification of}} remains is their knowledge of <b>osteology</b> and the various differences that occur within the human skeleton. During the course of an investigation, anthropologists are often tasked with helping to determinate an individual's sex, stature, age, and ancestry. To do this, anthropologists must be aware of how the human skeleton can differ between individuals.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} description, Hennig did not designate a holotype specimen. However, in a detailed monography on the <b>osteology,</b> systematic position and palaeobiology of Kentrosaurus in 1925, Hennig picked {{the most complete}} partial skeleton, today inventorised as MB.R.4800.1 through MB.R.4800.37, as a lectotype (see syntype). This material includes a nearly complete series of tail vertebrae, several vertebrae of the back, a sacrum with five sacral vertebrae and both ilia, both femora and an ulna, and {{is included in the}} mounted skeleton at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. The type locality is Kindope, Tanzania, near the Tendaguru hill.|$|E
5|$|Once {{undergraduate}} education is completed the individual should proceed to graduate level courses. Typically, forensic anthropologists obtain doctorates in physical anthropology and have completed coursework in <b>osteology,</b> forensics, and archaeology. It is also recommended that individuals looking {{to pursue a}} forensic anthropology profession get experience in dissection usually through a gross anatomy class as well as useful internships with investigative agencies or practicing anthropologists. Once educational requirements are complete one can become certified by the forensic anthropology society in the region. This can include the IALM exam given by the Forensic Anthropology Society of Europe or the certification exam given by the American Board of Forensic Anthropology.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 {{analysis}} of archaeological finds from Southwark in London, {{the site of}} the ancient Roman city Londinium in Roman Britain, suggests that two or three skeletons from a sample of twenty-two dating to the 2nd to the 4th centuries AD are of Asian ancestry, and possibly of Chinese descent. The assertion is based on forensics and the {{analysis of}} skeletal facial features. The discovery has been presented by Dr Rebecca Redfern, curator of human <b>osteology</b> at the Museum of London. No DNA analysis has yet been done, the skull and tooth samples available offer only fragmentary pieces of evidence, and the samples that were used were compared with the morphology of modern populations, not ancient ones.|$|E
5|$|Subfossils {{were also}} {{recovered}} during the 1860s, but more complete remains were found during the 1874 transit of Venus, since an observation station was {{located on the}} island. Many of these excavations were requested by brothers Alfred and Edward Newton, who used them to describe the <b>osteology</b> of the bird in detail. Thousands of bones were excavated, and mounted skeletons were composed from the remains of several specimens. It {{has been suggested that}} the skeleton of this species is the best described after that of humans. In spite of this, some later scholars doubted Leguat's story, and the existence of the Rodrigues solitaire. In 1955, George Evelyn Hutchinson doubted aspects of the bird's biology mentioned by Leguat, and in 1921, G. Atkinson claimed the memoir was merely a novel, and that the man had never even existed. Today, it is widely accepted that Leguat's memoirs are credible observations of the bird in life.|$|E

25|$|Cuvier then devoted {{himself more}} {{especially}} to three lines of inquiry: (i) {{the structure and}} classification of the Mollusca; (ii) the comparative anatomy and systematic arrangement of the fishes; (iii) fossil mammals and reptiles and, secondarily, the <b>osteology</b> of living forms belonging to the same groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{burrowing}} owl is sometimes {{classified in the}} monotypic genus Speotyto based on an overall different morphology and karyotype.

25|$|The {{study of}} bones and teeth is {{referred}} to as <b>osteology.</b> It is frequently used in anthropology, archeology and forensic science for a variety of tasks. This can include determining the nutritional, health, age or injury status of the individual the bones were taken from. Preparing fleshed bones for these types of studies can involve the process of maceration.|$|E
25|$|Curiously, Gregory Paul {{has noted}} that the cervicals of Protoavis and drepanosaurs are astonishingly similar, such they are hardly {{distinguishable}} from one another. Considering the modification of the drepanosaur neck {{for the purposes of}} snap-action predation, it becomes more likely that superficial similarities in the cervicals of both taxa are in fact only convergent with Aves. Chatterjee does not identify the remaining vertebrae as particularly avian in their <b>osteology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mayo {{brought the}} body of Maȟpiya Akan Nažiŋ to Le Sueur, Minnesota, where he {{dissected}} it {{in the presence of}} medical colleagues. Afterward, he had the skeleton cleaned, dried and varnished. Mayo kept it in an iron kettle in his home office. His sons received their first lessons in <b>osteology</b> from this skeleton. In the late 20th century, the identifiable remains of Maȟpiya Akan Nažiŋ and other Indians were returned by the Mayo Clinic to a Dakota tribe for reburial per the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} neck length, the known <b>osteology</b> of Miragaia resembles that of other stegosaurids, differing in small details. The tip of the beak was toothless, as in Stegosaurus. The upper beak, formed by the praemaxilla, was pendant. The notch in the snout tip was, seen from above, shaped like a W, whereas in Stegosaurus the notch is U-shaped, with a little bulbous {{projection}} in the middle. The upper surface of the nasal bone was ornamented. A ridge formed the contact with the maxilla. The maxilla had sixteen teeth. The postorbital was a small and triradiate element.|$|E
25|$|In {{his younger}} days Hume had studied some geology {{from the likes}} of Gideon Mantell and he {{appreciated}} the synthesis of ideas from other fields in ornithology. Hume included in 1872, a detailed article on the <b>osteology</b> of birds in relation to their classification written by Richard Lydekker who was then in the Geological Survey of India. The early meteorological work in India was done within the department headed by Hume and he saw the value of meteorology in the study of bird distributions. In a work comparing the rainfall zones, he notes how the high rainfall zones indicated affinities to the Malayan fauna.|$|E
25|$|Kenneth Carpenter and Matt Smith {{published}} {{a detailed description}} of the <b>osteology</b> and biomechanics of T. rex forelimbs. They concluded that T. rex arms were actually rather strong, but with a much smaller range of motion than other carnivorous dinosaurs like Allosaurus and Deinonychus. They concluded that while the arms of Tyrannosaurus would have been useless for actually killing prey, they may have been used to hold on to prey while the tyrannosaur killed it with bites. They dismissed notions that the forelimbs were useless or that Tyrannosaurus rex was an obligate scavenger. This study was the complete description of Tyrannosaurus forelimbs in the scientific literature.|$|E
25|$|The {{estimation}} {{of age in}} bioarchaeology and <b>osteology</b> actually refers to an approximation of skeletal or biological age-at-death. The primary assumption in age estimation is that an individual's skeletal age is closely associated with their chronological age. Age estimation can be based on patterns of growth and development or degenerative changes in the skeleton. Many methods tracking these types of changes have been developed {{using a variety of}} skeletal series. For instance, in children age is typically estimated by assessing their dental development, ossification and fusion of specific skeletal elements, or long bone length. In adults, degenerative changes to the pubic symphysis, the auricular surface of the ilium, the sternal end of the 4th rib, and dental attrition are commonly used to estimate skeletal age.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} his doctoral studies, Rasmussen was employed {{for one year}} as a visiting professor at Rice University and then worked as an assistant professor for the University of California, Los Angeles until 1991. That year he joined the Department of Anthropology in the Arts & Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL), and ten years later achieved tenure as a full professor. Courses he taught at WUSTL included the history of physical anthropology and human <b>osteology,</b> primate biology, evolution, functional morphology, paleobiology and phylogeny. He also co-taught a course on human evolution as represented in film and culture together with a cultural anthropologist and taught Environmental Studies starting in 1993. Rasmussen {{was the director of}} the graduate program and {{was a member of the}} Graduate Council in Arts & Sciences, both from 1993–1996 and 2004–2006, and was part of the university's Fulbright Committee starting in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Viking {{settlements}} in Ireland and Great Britain {{are thought to}} have been primarily male enterprises, however some graves show nearly equal male/female distribution. Disagreement is partly due to method of classification; previous archaeology often guessed biological sex from burial artifacts, whereas modern archaeology may use <b>osteology</b> to find biological sex, and isotope analysis to find origin (DNA sampling is usually not possible). The males buried during that period in a cemetery on the Isle of Man had mainly names of Norse origin, while the females there had names of indigenous origin. Irish and British women are mentioned in old texts on the founding of Iceland, indicating that the Viking explorers were accompanied there by women from the British Isles who either came along voluntarily or were taken along by force. Genetic studies of the population in the Western Isles and Isle of Skye also show that Viking settlements were established mainly by male Vikings who mated with women from the local populations of those places.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{research}} of the Lake Baikal region’s Middle Holocene hunter-gatherers began {{during the second half}} of the 19th century and was followed by a long period of intensive research conducted during the Soviet period by researchers such as Alexei Pavlovich Okladnikov. The Baikal Archaeology Project was formed in the mid-1990s during the time of profound political, social, and economic changes in Russia. Since then, the Baikal Archaeology Project launched an extensive multidisciplinary investigation of Middle Holocene hunter-gatherers of the Baikal region. The research model involves both original fieldwork and the application of modern laboratory techniques to previously as well as recently excavated collections of archaeological materials. Much of this work is facilitated by the presence of prehistoric cemeteries with well-preserved human remains – an unusual hunter-gatherer characteristic from a global perspective. Employing many advanced research methods and the integration of diverse lines of evidence generated by mortuary archaeology, zooarchaeology, radiocarbon dating, human <b>osteology,</b> isotope geochemistry, ancient and modern DNA research, ethnoarchaeology, and paleoclimatic and environmental studies, the project aims to achieve an improved understanding of the cultural complexity, variability, and dynamics of the long-term culture change among past boreal foragers in the Baikal region.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{description of}} the species noted strong similarities between the <b>osteology</b> of Huabeisaurus and other Cretaceous East Asian sauropods, and in general, previous studies have pointed to some East Asian Cretaceous sauropod (like Nemegtosaurus and Phuwiangosaurus) as the sister taxon of Huabeisaurus. Since 2000, {{the year of the}} original description of Huabeisaurus, 17 new sauropod species have been erected from the Cretaceous of East Asia. Many authors have noted similarities among Cretaceous East Asian sauropods, often suggesting that several of these taxa belong to a clade grounded on a genus with well-known anatomy (like Nemegtosauridae, Opisthocoelicaudinae, and Euhelopodidae). Cladistic support was recently presented for a Euhelopodidae that consisted of exclusively Cretaceous-aged members, in contrast with traditional studies and early cladistic analyses that placed the existence of a Euhelopodidae with Jurassic forms. Both earlier and later analyses suggest some degree of endemism in East Asia, though its temporal duration remains uncertain. On a broader scale, an interesting evolutionary pattern has been recognized wherein all pre-Cretaceous Jurassic Asian sauropods lie outside of Neosauropoda, whereas all Cretaceous Asian sauropods are titanosauriforms. Refining and explaining these paleobiogeographic patterns through time rests on detailed comparisons and comprehensive phylogenetic studies including East Asian sauropods, which are currently lacking.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} paleontology often uses techniques {{derived from}} other sciences, including biology, <b>osteology,</b> ecology, chemistry, physics and mathematics. For example, geochemical signatures from rocks {{may help to}} discover when life first arose on Earth, and analyses of carbon isotope ratios may help to identify climate changes and even to explain major transitions such as the Permian–Triassic extinction event. A relatively recent discipline, molecular phylogenetics, often helps by using comparisons of different modern organisms' DNA and RNA to re-construct evolutionary [...] "family trees"; {{it has also been}} used to estimate the dates of important evolutionary developments, although this approach is controversial because of doubts about the reliability of the [...] "molecular clock". Techniques developed in engineering have been used to analyse how ancient organisms might have worked, for example how fast Tyrannosaurus could move and how powerful its bite was. It is relatively commonplace to study fossils using X-ray microtomography A combination of paleontology, biology, and archaeology, paleoneurobiology is the study of endocranial casts (or endocasts) of species related to humans to learn about the evolution of human brains.|$|E
500|$|Forensic archaeologists employ their {{knowledge}} of proper excavation techniques to ensure that remains are recovered in a controlled and forensically acceptable manner. When remains are found partially or completely buried the proper excavation of the remains will ensure that any evidence present on the bones will remain intact. [...] The difference between forensic archaeologists and forensic anthropologists is that where forensic anthropologists are trained specifically in human <b>osteology</b> and recovery of human remains, forensic archaeologists specialize more broadly in the processes of search and discovery. In addition to remains, archaeologists are trained to look for objects contained {{in and around the}} excavation area. These objects can include anything from wedding rings to potentially probative evidence such as cigarette butts or shoe prints. [...] Their training extends further to observing context, association and significance of objects in a crime scene and drawing conclusions that may be useful for locating a victim or suspect. A forensic archaeologist must also be able to utilize a degree of creativity and adaptability during times when crime scenes can not be excavated using traditional archaeological techniques. For example, one particular case study was conducted on the search and recovery of the remains of a missing girl who was found in a septic tank underground. This instance required unique methods unlike those of a typical archeological excavation in order to exhume and preserve the contents of the tank.|$|E
500|$|Louis Etienne Thirioux, {{an amateur}} naturalist at Port Louis, also found many dodo remains around 1900 from several locations. They {{included}} the first articulated specimen, {{which is the}} first subfossil dodo skeleton found outside the Mare aux Songes, and the only remains of a juvenile specimen, a now lost tarsometatarsus. The former specimen was found in 1904 in a cave near Le Pouce mountain, and is the only known complete skeleton of an individual dodo. Thirioux donated the specimen to the Museum Desjardins (now Natural History Museum at Mauritius Institute). Thrioux's heirs sold a second mounted composite skeleton (composed of at least two skeletons, with a mainly reconstructed skull) to the Durban Museum of Natural Science in South Africa in 1918. Together, these two skeletons represent the most completely known dodo remains, including bone elements previously unrecorded (such as knee-caps and various wing bones). Though some contemporary writers noted the importance of Thrioux's specimens, they were not scientifically studied, and were largely forgotten until 2011, when sought out by a group of researchers. The mounted skeletons were laser scanned, from which 3-D models were reconstructed, which became the basis of a 2016 monograph about the <b>osteology</b> of the dodo. [...] In 2006, explorers discovered a complete skeleton of a dodo in a lava cave in Mauritius. This was only the second associated skeleton of an individual specimen everfound, and the only one in recent times.|$|E
