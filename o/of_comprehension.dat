5|$|Gaudí's {{position}} {{in the history of}} architecture is that of a creative genius who, inspired by nature, developed a style of his own that attained technical perfection as well as aesthetic value, and bore the mark of his character. Gaudí's structural innovations were to an extent the result of his journey through various styles, from Doric to Baroque via Gothic, his main inspiration. It could be said that these styles culminated in his work, which reinterpreted and perfected them. Gaudí passed through the historicism and eclecticism of his generation without connecting with other architectural movements of the 20th century that, with their rationalist postulates, derived from the Bauhaus school, and represented an antithetical evolution to that initiated by Gaudí, given that it later reflected the disdain and the initial lack <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> of the work of the modernista architect.|$|E

25|$|Naive {{set theory}} (the axiom schema of {{unrestricted}} comprehension and the axiom of extensionality) is inconsistent due to Russell's paradox. In early formalizations of sets, mathematicians and logicians have avoided that contradiction by replacing the axiom schema <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> with the much weaker axiom schema of separation. However, this step alone takes one to theories of sets which are considered too weak. So {{some of the}} power <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> was added back via the other existence axioms of ZF set theory (pairing, union, powerset, replacement, and infinity) which may be regarded as special cases <b>of</b> <b>comprehension.</b> So far, these axioms {{do not seem to}} lead to any contradiction. Subsequently, the axiom of choice and the axiom of regularity were added to exclude models with some undesirable properties. These two axioms are known to be relatively consistent.|$|E
25|$|Accepting {{only the}} axiom schema of {{specification}} {{was the beginning}} of axiomatic set theory. Most of the other Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms (but not the axiom of extensionality or the axiom of regularity) then became necessary to make up for some of what was lost by changing the axiom schema <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> to the axiom schema of specification – each of these axioms states that a certain set exists, and defines that set by giving a predicate for its members to satisfy, i.e. it is a special case of the axiom schema <b>of</b> <b>comprehension.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Eye {{tracking}} methodology {{has been}} a major empirical research approach for the study <b>of</b> online <b>comprehension</b> processes in reading and scene viewing. The use of eye tracking methodology for the study of diagrammatic representations, however, has been relatively limited so far. The investigation of specific types of diagrammatic representations, such as statistical graphs is even scarce. In this study, we propose eye tracking as an empirical research approach for a systematic analysis <b>of</b> multimodal <b>comprehension</b> <b>of</b> line graphs. Based on a framework <b>of</b> multimodal <b>comprehension</b> <b>of</b> graphs and texts, which focuses on the role of spatial concepts, we present an experimental investigation of linguistic guidance and eye movement control in <b>comprehension</b> <b>of</b> time-domain line graphs with a particular focus on the analysis of gaze patterns in graph inspections...|$|R

25|$|In the New Foundations {{approach}} to set theory pioneered by W.V.O. Quine, the axiom <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> {{for a given}} predicate takes the unrestricted form, but the predicates {{that may be used}} in the schema are themselves restricted.|$|E

25|$|Later, Schwartz and Kroll used cognate and {{homograph}} as target words {{presented in}} low- and high-constraint sentences to Spanish-English bilinguals. They investigated how word presentation and the semantic constraint modulated language lexical access in bilinguals. Schwartz and Kroll used rapid serial visual presentation {{and the target}} word had to be named. No homograph effects were found, but less proficient bilinguals made more naming errors, especially in low-constraint sentences. They observed cognate facilitation (nonselective bilingual lexical access) in low-constraint sentences, but not in high-constraint ones. The {{results suggest that the}} semantic constraint of a sentence may restrict cross-lingual activation effects. Similar results on cognate effects were obtained by van Hell and de Groot in their study of Dutch-English bilinguals in an L2 lexical decision task and a translation task in forward (from L1 to L2) and in backward direction (from L2 to L1). Libben and Titone used eye tracking methodology and found that the cognate facilitation in semantically constraint sentences only happened at early stages <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> and rapidly resolved at later stages <b>of</b> <b>comprehension.</b>|$|E

25|$|To {{confirm the}} notion that {{language}} acquisition occurs as a progression <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> before production, Castro and Snowdon (2000) showed that infants respond behaviorally to vocalizing adults in a fashion that indicates they can comprehend auditory inputs.

This finding argues for the idea that infants are able to understand vocalizations first, and later acquire the ability to communicate with adult vocalizations.|$|E

Dirk Münch stated that, after the film, his father had even confused the female house cat Minka with the male cat Peter. A German filmmaker who made a documentary about Münch also stated that he was non compos mentis. He was later diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

25|$|It was the {{tendency}} of the philosophy of Cousin to outline things and to fill up the details in an artistic and imaginative interest. He was observational and generalizing rather than analytic and discriminating. His search into principles was not profound, and his power of rigorous consecutive development was limited. He left no distinctive permanent principle of philosophy, but he left very interesting psychological analyses, and several new, just, and true expositions of philosophical systems, especially that of Locke and the philosophers of Scotland. He was {{at the same time}} a man of impressive power, of rare and wide culture, and of lofty aim,--far above priestly conception and Philistine narrowness. He was familiar with the broad lines of most systems of philosophy. His eclecticism was proof of a reverential sympathy with the struggles of human thought to attain to certainty in the highest problems of speculation. It was a doctrine <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> and toleration, forming a marked and valuable contrast to the arrogance of absolutism, to the dogmatism of sensationalism, and to the doctrine of church authority, preached by the theological school of his day. His spirit saved the youth of France from these other influences. As an educational reformer and a man of learning, who greatly influenced others, Cousin stands out among the memorable Frenchmen of the 19th century.|$|E
