5|$|As {{the result}} of the {{accidents}} in the 1970s and 1980s, most notably following the 1985 crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191, in 1988 the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have on-board wind shear detection systems by 1993. Between 1964 and 1985, wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the U.S. that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries. Since 1995, the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately <b>one</b> <b>every</b> ten years, due to the mandated on-board detection as well as the addition of Doppler weather radar units on the ground (NEXRAD). The installation of high-resolution Terminal Doppler Weather Radar stations at many U.S. airports that are commonly affected by wind shear has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid wind shear conditions.|$|E

The Metropolitan Railway put on additional trains to commute fans from Baker Street station to Wembley Park; <b>one</b> <b>every</b> two minutes.

They also recorded a club record low of three league defeats, and a club record home clean sheet streak of eleven matches, lasting from 7 September 1953 to 13 February 1954. Another club record was a streak of six away draws, lasting from 20 March to 26 April.

5|$|As {{the game}} neared completion, Miller began {{to market the}} game to players. Strongly {{encouraged}} by the updates the team was sending him, he began heavily advertising the game {{in all of the}} bulletin board systems (BBS) and game magazines he had access to. The game was completed in early December 1990, and on the afternoon of December 14 Miller began uploading the completed first episode to BBSs, with the other two episodes listed as available for purchase as a mailed plastic bag with floppy disks for US$30. After the arrival of the first royalty check from Apogee, the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss and owner of Softdisk Al Vekovius confronted them on their plans, as well as their use of company resources to develop the game, the team made no secret of their intentions. Vekovius initially proposed a joint venture between the team and Softdisk, which fell apart when the other employees of the firm threatened to quit in response, and after a few weeks of negotiation the team agreed to produce a series of games for Gamer's Edge, <b>one</b> <b>every</b> two months.|$|E
5|$|Because a Hurricane Watch {{existed for}} the New York City {{metropolitan}} area, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani urged citizens to take preparations. In addition, city officials {{set up a}} hurricane helpline, activated the city's Emergency Command Center at the Police Headquarters, and distributed leaflets to flood-prone areas. Near New Bedford, Massachusetts, where landfall was predicted to occur, schools were prepared as shelters {{in case of a}} direct hit. New Bedford Mayor issued a state of emergency for the city. However, few people stayed in shelters during the storm's passage. On Cape Cod, thousands of tourists and summer residents evacuated in preparation for the storm, resulting in an 18-mile (29km) traffic backup. As a result, many beach resorts lost millions in potential revenue. Of those who remained on Cape Cod, 900 stayed in emergency shelters when the storm passed the area. In Boston's Logan International Airport, numerous flights were cancelled or delayed to move planes to safety. Many sailors removed their boats from the water prior to the storm. At one time in Mattapoisett Harbor, workers removed boats at a rate of <b>one</b> <b>every</b> eight minutes. In Maine, the Red Cross opened several emergency shelters, though they were never used. Like in Massachusetts, sailors removed their boats, and due to media coverage, residents were well-prepared for the hurricane.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Traffic {{accidents}} {{with high}} {{morbidity and mortality}} rates {{are one of the}} most important problems of the world. Several factors have been described for the occurrence of traffic accidents. Two of them are traffic congestion and road density which have infrequently been reported in the Turkish literature. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the relationship between road traffic accidents, population size, and the number of motor vehicles in Turkey. Material and methods: The crude data were obtained from the web page of the Turkish Statistical Institute. They was standardized for <b>every</b> <b>one</b> million population, <b>every</b> <b>one</b> million motor vehicles, or <b>every</b> <b>one</b> thousand road traffic accidents. The system of Statistical Regions was used in the classification. Results: In Turkey, the total number of inhabitants was 74, 724, 269 and the number of motor vehicles was 16, 089, 528 in 2011. As a result of 131, 845 road traffic accidents 3, 835 people died and 238, 074 people were injured. In the evaluation of  the distribution of the number of motor vehicles for <b>every</b> <b>one</b> million population, the distribution of the number of road traffic accidents for <b>every</b> <b>one</b> million population and <b>every</b> <b>one</b> million motor vehicles,  the distribution of the number of people died in road traffic accidents for <b>every</b> <b>one</b> million population, <b>every</b> <b>one</b> million motor vehicles and <b>every</b> <b>one</b> thousand road traffic accidents, and the distribution of the number of people injured in road traffic accidents for <b>every</b> <b>one</b> million population, <b>every</b> <b>one</b> million motor vehicles and <b>every</b> <b>one</b> thousand road traffic accidents were all statistically significant. Conclusion: In the traffic accidents, urban and rural society based projects for the identification of risk factors and the preventive measures are great importance. This study represents a pioneer step forward in this field in Turkey. Keywords: Road traffic accidents, traffic congestion, road density, number of motor vehicles, population...|$|R
5|$|In October–December 1990, {{a team of}} {{employees}} from programming studio Softdisk calling themselves Ideas from the Deep developed the three-part video game Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, the first game in the Commander Keen series.

5|$|It is {{possible}} that the age of fusion–evaporation reactions to produce superheavy elements {{is coming to an end}} due to the increasingly short half-lives to spontaneous fission and the looming proton drip line, so that new techniques such as nuclear transfer reactions (for example, firing uranium nuclei at each other and letting them exchange protons, potentially producing products with around 120 protons) would be required to reach the superactinides. On the other hand, many changes in techniques have been needed to synthesise transuranium elements, from neutron capture (until Z = 100) to light-ion bombardment (until Z = 110) to cold fusion (until Z = 113) and now hot fusion with 48Ca (until Z = 118), not to mention the essential difference before and after uranium between finding the elements chemically or spectroscopically in nature and synthesising them. In spite of this, the rate of discovery of new elements has remained at <b>one</b> <b>every</b> two and a half years on average for the past two and a half centuries.|$|E

Gothenburg has hosted eight, and Malmö seven. The competition's final has never been held outside these cities. Before the expansion, the host of the previous year's Melodifestival would host the Eurovision Song Contest {{in the event of a}} Swedish victory. Hence, the 1985 Eurovision was held in Gothenburg, and the 1992 contest in Malmö.
