Also sometimes used are broader visual presentations {{of words and}} calligraphy. These basic units of poetic form are often combined into larger structures, called poetic forms or poetic modes (see following section), as in the sonnet or haiku.|$|E
25|$|Plautus was {{apparently}} {{read in the}} 9th century. His form was too complex to be fully understood, however, and, {{as indicated by the}} Terentius et delusor, it was unknown at the time if Plautus was writing in prose <b>or</b> <b>verse.</b>|$|E
25|$|For Bede's two {{dedicated}} {{accounts of}} Cuthbert's life, the Anonymous Life {{is the chief}} source. Bede however made little acknowledgment of his debt to the Anonymous Life in either his prose <b>or</b> <b>verse</b> life, and indeed if we were dependent only on Bede we would probably not know the work ever existed. Stylistically the Latin of the Anonymous Life is not as grammatical and classicizing as Bede's Prose Life, and Bede went to some effort to 'improve' the prose.|$|E

25|$|Further {{emphasizing}} and {{elevating the}} artistry {{of the language}} of the plays of Plautus is the use of meter, which simply put is the rhythm of the play. There seems to be great debate over whether Plautus found favor in strong word accent <b>or</b> <b>verse</b> ictus, stress. Plautus did not follow the meter of the Greek originals that he adapted for the Roman audience. Plautus used a great number of meters, but most frequently he used the trochaic septenarius. Iambic words, though common in Latin, are difficult to fit in this meter, and naturally occur at the end of verses. G.B. Conte has noted that Plautus favors the use of cantica instead of Greek meters. This vacillation between meter and word stress highlights the fact that Latin literature was still in its infancy, and that there was not yet a standard way to write verse.|$|E
25|$|The company's new cahier des charges (license) was liberal. It {{called for}} new French operas with spoken {{dialogue}} (opéra comique) or sung recitative, prose <b>or</b> <b>verse</b> librettos, and {{with or without}} ballets. No single composer could have more than six new acts presented in one season (acts were counted rather than works). Preference was {{to be given to}} Prix de Rome winners up to two years after the award. In addition, up to two translated foreign works were permitted, as well as French works ten years after their premiere, and any number of public domain works, so long as these did not exceed 33% of the number of new acts presented over a two-year period. The company had the right to revive any works it had already produced, to encourage the company to establish its own repertory. As the company did not receive any state subsidy before 1864, revivals of popular, established works were critical to its financial survival.|$|E
25|$|Many tattoos {{serve as}} rites of passage, marks of status and rank, symbols of {{religious}} and spiritual devotion, decorations for bravery, sexual lures and marks of fertility, pledges of love, amulets and talismans, protection, and as punishment, like the marks of outcasts, slaves and convicts. The symbolism and impact of tattoos varies in different places and cultures. Tattoos may show how a person feels about a relative (commonly mother/father or daughter/son) or about an unrelated person. Today, people choose to be tattooed for artistic, cosmetic, sentimental/memorial, religious, and magical reasons, and to symbolize their belonging to or identification with particular groups, including criminal gangs (see criminal tattoos) or a particular ethnic group or law-abiding subculture. Some Māori still choose to wear intricate moko on their faces. In Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, the yantra tattoo is used for protection against evil and to increase luck. Text-based tattoos including quotes, lyrics, personal mottos or scripture are popular in western culture. As an example some Christians might have a Psalm <b>or</b> <b>verse</b> from the Bible tattooed on their body. Popular verses include John 3:16, Philippians 4:13, and Psalms 23.|$|E

500|$|The {{translator}} Ross Smith {{comments that}} while Tolkien was cautious about publishing his translations of Beowulf, [...] "he was {{quite willing to}} explain the approach that in his opinion should be taken towards such a monolithic task." [...] Smith points out that, unlike publishing a prose <b>or</b> <b>verse</b> translation, explaining his translation criteria did not expose Tolkien to aesthetic criticism. Smith remarks that Tolkien is [...] "somewhat disdainful" [...] of Clark Hall's version, such things being useful as study-guides and little else; putting Old English poetry into modern English prose inevitably creates something [...] "dull and flat", so Tolkien much prefers versions that try to preserve the original's rhyme and metre. Smith notes that the same opinion {{can be found in}} Tolkien's essay [...] "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight".|$|E
500|$|Truss {{highlights}} the importance that Gibbons places on detachment as a necessary adjunct to effective writing: [...] "Like many a good doctor, {{she seems to have}} considered sympathy a peculiar and [...] redundant emotion, and a terrible waste of time." [...] This matter-of-fact quality in her prose might, according to Gibbons's Guardian obituarist Richard Boston, be a reaction against the turbulent and sometimes violent emotions that she witnessed within her own family who, she said, [...] "were all madly highly-sexed, like the Starkadders". It is, observed Neville, an irony that the overheated [...] melodrama [...] that Gibbons most disliked {{was at the heart of}} her one great [...] success; [...] Gibbons's writings on everyday life brought her restrained approval, but no noticeable literary recognition. Nevertheless, her straightforward, style, unadorned except in parody, is admired by Rachel Cooke, who praises her as [...] "a sworn enemy of the flatulent, the pompous and the excessively sentimental." [...] While short of sentimentality, Gibbons's writing, in prose <b>or</b> <b>verse,</b> did not lack sensitivity. She had what one analyst described as [...] "a rare ability to enter into the feelings of the uncommunicative and to bring to life the emotions of the unremarkable".|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before his}} {{deployment}} to Europe, the Kilmers' daughter Rose had died, and twelve days later, their son Christopher was born. [...] Before his departure, Kilmer had contracted with publishers {{to write a}} book about the war, deciding upon the title Here and There with the Fighting Sixty-Ninth. The regiment arrived in France in November 1917, and Kilmer wrote to his wife that he had not written [...] "anything in prose <b>or</b> <b>verse</b> since I got here—except statistics—but I've stored up a lot of memories to turn into copy when I get a chance." [...] Kilmer did not write such a book; however, toward the end of the year, he did find time to write prose sketches and poetry. [...] The most notable of his poems during this period was [...] "Rouge Bouquet" [...] (1918) which commemorated the deaths of two dozen members of his regiment in a German artillery barrage on American trench positions in the Rouge Bouquet forest north-east of the French village of Baccarat. [...] At the time, this was a relatively quiet sector of the front, but the first battalion was struck by a German heavy artillery bombardment on the afternoon of March 7, 1918 that buried 21 men of the unit, killing 19 (of which 14 remained entombed).|$|E

2500|$|The Hebrew word Halleluya as an {{expression}} of praise to God was preserved, untranslated, by the Early Christians as a superlative expression of thanksgiving, joy, and triumph.
