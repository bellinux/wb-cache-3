Nonetheless, Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong has made an ex curiae (<b>out-of-court)</b> <b>statement</b> to the effect that where the allegation of apparent bias is made by a professional man (such as a lawyer) against a court or a tribunal, as in Singh Kalpanath, it may be argued that the better viewpoint should be from that of the legal profession or the professional class, and not that of the layman.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hearsay rule}} is an {{analytic}} {{rule of evidence}} that defines hearsay and provides for both exceptions and exemptions from that rule. There is no all-encompassing definition of hearsay in the United States. However, most evidentiary codes defining hearsay adopt verbatim the rule as {{laid out in the}} Federal Rules of Evidence, which generally defines hearsay as an <b>out-of-court</b> <b>statement</b> introduced to prove {{the truth of the matter}} asserted. [...] "Out-of-court" [...] is shorthand for any statement other than one made under oath and in front of the factfinder (the jury, or the judge in a bench trial) during the same proceeding in which it is being offered in evidence. [...] "Matter asserted" [...] means the matter asserted in the statement offered into evidence, not the matter [...] "asserted" [...] by the party offering the evidence. Evidence typically is introduced to support not just one proposition but a series of propositions, linked together in an inferential chain. If any one of the propositions in the inferential chain is [...] "the truth of the matter asserted" [...] in the <b>out-of-court</b> <b>statement,</b> the evidence falls within the traditional definition of hearsay. The declarant is the person that makes the out-of-court statement—not the person bringing the action (lawsuit).|$|E
2500|$|This {{decision}} had an immediate, profound effect upon {{the ability of}} prosecutors to prove their cases {{through the use of}} evidence that had previously been admissible via various exceptions to the hearsay rule. Justice Scalia's opinion explicitly states that any <b>out-of-court</b> <b>statement</b> that is [...] "testimonial" [...] in nature is not admissible, unless the declarant is unavailable to testify in court, and the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him or her. However, the opinion does not define [...] "testimonial", which has allowed courts across the country to determine that issue for themselves.|$|E

25|$|This, of course, is {{not always}} true. Patients do {{sometimes}} lie to their doctors (to get painkillers {{to which they are}} not entitled, for example). Hearsay exceptions do not mandate that a trier of fact (the jury or, in non-jury trials, the judge) accept the hearsay statement as being true. Hearsay exceptions mean only that the trier of fact will be informed of the hearsay statement and will be allowed to consider it when deciding on a verdict in the case. The jury is free to disregard a hearsay statement if the jury does not believe it. The hearsay rule controls only what <b>out-of-court</b> <b>statements</b> a trier of fact gets to consider in deciding a case, not how they consider the <b>out-of-court</b> <b>statements.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Chief Justice William Rehnquist concurred in the result, {{but would}} have decided the case on {{narrower}} grounds, within the older Roberts framework.

2500|$|The {{theory of}} the rule {{excluding}} hearsay is that assertions made by human beings are often unreliable; such statements are often insincere, subject to flaws in memory and perception, or infected with errors in narration {{at the time they}} are given. Furthermore, someone testifying in court regarding another's <b>out-of-court</b> <b>statement</b> may have misheard or misremembered that statement, in addition to possibly having misinterpreted the speaker's sincerity, etc. The law therefore finds it necessary to subject this form of evidence to [...] "scrutiny or analysis calculated to discover and expose in detail its possible weaknesses, and thus to enable the tribunal (judge or jury) to estimate it at no more than its actual value".|$|E
2500|$|A person's own prior {{statements}} can be hearsay. For example, {{suppose a}} person is testifying on the stand. In relation to an automobile accident where a blue truck struck a yellow car, the witness testifies, [...] "I told the police officer the truck was blue" [...] to establish {{the color of the}} car (as opposed to whether he had lied to police, or the officer had falsified the witness reports). This statement is an <b>out-of-court</b> <b>statement</b> offered for the purpose of proving {{the truth of the matter}} asserted, and is therefore hearsay. The witness is testifying about what someone said in the past. The fact that it is his own statement does not change the hearsay nature of the statement.|$|E

Fishman's office filed a brief to Wigenton requesting that the Bridgegate records remain sealed so that the list of uncharged third-party co-conspirators not be made public. Coconspirators refers to [...] "individuals the government believes may have known about the plot to abruptly shut down access lanes to the bridge to cause massive traffic disruptions, but were not charged." [...] Fishman claimed that it was a policy of the United States Department of Justice [...] "to avoid unnecessary public references to wrongdoing" [...] by unindicted co-conspirator because they have no [...] "evidentiary value" [...] in the criminal matter. If the names were made public, then public employees or appointed officials, who were said {{to be involved in the}} lane closures, would not have the [...] "opportunity to challenge that information in court."

5000|$|... "Hearsay is a statement, {{other than}} one {{made by the}} {{declarant}} while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove {{the truth of the}} matter asserted." [...] Per Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(a), a statement made by a defendant is admissible as evidence only if it is inculpatory; exculpatory statements made to an investigator are hearsay and therefore may not be admitted as evidence in court, unless the defendant testifies. When an <b>out-of-court</b> <b>statement</b> offered as evidence contains another <b>out-of-court</b> <b>statement</b> it is called double hearsay, and both layers of hearsay must be found separately admissible.|$|E

40|$|Rules of {{evidence}} {{are designed to}} bring about just and informed decisions.

40|$|Young {{children}} are frequently precluded from testifying at trial {{on the grounds}} of incompetency because they cannot answer questions about abstract concepts regarding “truth” and “lies. ” In this situation, should the child’s earlier, <b>out-of-court</b> <b>statements</b> disclosing the abuse and identifying the abuser also be inadmissible? The stakes are huge. If young children cannot testify, and their <b>out-of-court</b> <b>statements</b> are precluded, they simply become safe prey, unprotected by the judicial system. The pivotal question becomes, are there procedures that can ensure fairness both to children and to their alleged abusers? This article argues that a child’s testimonial incapacity at trial ought not automatically bar the admission of nontestimonial statements that fall within exceptions to the hearsay rule. Admissibility should turn on whether, in light of principles of developmental psychology as applied to the particular child, at the time the child made the statement he was capable of making an accurate statement of that type: if so, the evidence ought not be excluded on the ground of incompetency to testify. Attacks on the child’s credibility should go to the weight of this evidence, not its admissibility...|$|R
25|$|There are {{two other}} common misconceptions {{concerning}} the hearsay rule. The first is that hearsay applies only to oral statements. The hearsay rule applies to all <b>out-of-court</b> <b>statements</b> whether oral, written or otherwise. The Federal Rules of Evidence defines a statement as an oral or written assertion or nonverbal conduct of a person, if the conduct is intended by the person as an assertion.

40|$|The Supreme Court’s {{decision}} in Ohio v.

40|$|I {{begin with}} a {{question}} of effectiveness: does the new Confrontation Clause doctrine effectively protect defendants {{with respect to the}} most im-portant types of problematic <b>out-of-court</b> <b>statements?</b> Although they leave much room for the introduction of hearsay {{in the immediate aftermath of}} crime generally, Davis v. Washington and Hammon v. Indiana (together hereinafter Davis) are better opinions from that broad perspective than I had feared. The new doctrine now covers and provides substantial procedural protection for a very important class of problematic hearsay—statements made to government agents investigating past crime...|$|R
