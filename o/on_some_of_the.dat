5|$|Because of {{a design}} flaw, ships of this class have {{inherent}} lists to starboard when under combat loads that exceed {{the capability of}} their list control systems.

5|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{success of the}} First Serbian Uprising, by 1813 the Ottomans had reoccupied vast areas of Serbia {{that had once been}} under rebel control and {{captured}} Belgrade. Once Serbia was firmly in their control, the Ottomans carried out numerous revenge killings throughout the countryside. Following these attacks, the Grand Vizier declared an amnesty, and many Serbs who had gone into hiding returned to their homes. Given Serbia's lack of good roads, the Ottomans had to rely <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Serb rebels, such as Stanoje Glavaš and Miloš Obrenović, to maintain order and collect taxes on their behalf. This arrangement remained unchanged until early 1815, when the Ottomans turned <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former rebels and killed them. Rumours of an impending Ottoman assault spread quickly throughout Serbia. In April 1815, on Palm Sunday, Serb elders and leaders met in the village of Takovo and elected Obrenović their leader. Shortly afterwards, the Serbs rose in revolt, inflicting a series of humiliating defeats on the Ottomans, in what {{came to be known as}} the Second Serbian Uprising. In subsequent peace treaties, the Serbs were granted autonomy, and Obrenović was recognized as the Prince of Serbia.|$|E

For example, the characters of Goneril and Regan, the comparison of which he begins with a note of personal distaste ("they are so thoroughly hateful {{that we do not}} even like to repeat their names"), are shown, he points out, partly in their reaction to their sister Cordelia's desire that they treat their father well—Prescribe not to us our duties—and partly by the contrast of their hypocrisy with the candor of the otherwise evil Edmund.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century the kelp {{industry}} provided significant employment <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orkney islands, but when the market collapsed between 1830 and 1832 it caused considerable hardship. North Ronaldsay was especially hard-hit and several families were allowed to resettle from there to develop land at Westside on Eday. Rising populations meant increasing land values, especially for small tenancies. In 1843 crofts were valued at £1/acre on Eday, nearly three times the price for larger farms. However, the 20th century saw decline. Immigration from mainland Scotland was essentially unknown even in the late 1950s and the population in 2001 was about an eighth of the total 160 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> figures, however, {{there still}} remains clear {{evidence}} of painting in carbon black.

Things that might affect the degree of finish achieved on a particular giornata include the heat and humidity of the day and the length of daylight hours. Whatever the reason for the difference is, a difference in approach to the light and shade on the individual figures is clearly apparent.|$|E

5|$|The main rock {{formations}} {{in the area}} of West Branch Fishing Creek are the Catskill Formation, the Huntley Mountain Formation, and the Burgoon Sandstone. These formations are all primarily made of sandstone, but also contain conglomerate, shale, and siltstone. They were formed during the Devonian, Mississippian and Devonian, and the Mississippian, respectively. The Catskill Formation is mostly found in the lower and middle reaches of the watershed, along the creek and its tributaries. The Huntley Mountain Formation is found in {{the upper reaches of the}} watershed and <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> streams in that part of the watershed. The Burgoon Sandstone is found in the watershed, but not on many of its streams.|$|E

Talaskangas Nature Reserve, with nearly pristine natural forest and about 50 different wildlife species, is in the Vieremä and Sonkajärvi local area. Logging was planned in the 1980s, but environmental activists prevented exploitation through lobbying. The reserve was formally established in 1994.|$|E
