50|$|In {{the matters}} {{concerning}} Cook Chemical, Scoggin, a corporate officer at Cook, had originally based his design on Calmar’s previous unpatented design, but later {{claimed that the}} integration of the sprayer and container solved the problem of external leakage during assembly and shipping of insecticide products. The district court held that Scoggin’s sprayer was not obvious because even though its individual elements were not novel, nothing in the prior art would have suggested the combination of elements. After the initial rejection of his patent, Scoggin drafted claims more carefully to distinguish the prior art, limiting new claims to the use of a rib seal, rather than a washer or gasket, to maintain a seal, as well as the existence of a small space between the <b>overcap</b> and the sprayer. Clark held that because Scoggin narrowed his claims to meet the limitations requested by the patent examiner, Cook Chemical could not now claim broader subject matter (see Prosecution history estoppel). Clark further held that the differences between Scoggin’s design and the prior art were simply too minor and non-technical to maintain the validity of Cook’s patent.|$|E

Power Games and Issues in Tournaisis {{from late}} 14 th to late 16 th century Between the 14 th and the 16 th century, Tournaisis counted {{only for a}} grain of dust {{on the scale of}} the Kingdom of France and later, after 1521, of Charles the Fifth’s Low Countries. The roughly sixty rural parishes that it {{consisted}} of had been combined together since 1383 into one bailiwick of Tournai, Tournaisis, Mortagne and Saint-Amand, making up the intermediary administrative framework exercising the greatest part of the regalian prerogatives in the province. This bailiwick is superimposed on and rivals more ancient feudal and allodial courts of Tournaisis; it is in turn <b>overcapped</b> by the Provincial States, evolved in the 16 th century {{to meet the needs of}} direct government tax system. At local level, powers are extremely fragmented into a variety of seigneuries. Seigneurial authority rests on feudal courts and a multiplicity of échevinages, which enframe rather poorly organized village communities. Over these two centuries, the people at work within the province structures were probably more deeply affected by evolution than the very institutions themselves. In the villages, the interwoven seigneurial frameworks, Tournai's political and economic weight together with the influence of Flemish institutions all partook in the freezing of the diversity of existing power balances. Whereas the development and the administrative improvement of the French and Habsburg monarchies are indisputable, their effects at the intermediary level remain moderate and uneven at local level. The Modern State leaves wide space to structures inherited from the feudal system. In Tournaisis power is more shared than centralized and institutional competition develops more horizontally than vertically. (HIAR - Histoire, art et archéologie) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
