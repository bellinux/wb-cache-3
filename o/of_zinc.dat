5|$|In 1982, the US Mint began minting pennies {{coated in}} copper but {{containing}} primarily zinc. The new zinc pennies pose a risk <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> toxicosis, {{which can be}} fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1kg <b>of</b> <b>zinc)</b> resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis. Another patient who ingested 12grams <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> showed only lethargy and ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements). Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> coins.|$|E

5|$|In blood plasma, zinc {{is bound}} to and transported by albumin (60%, low-affinity) and {{transferrin}} (10%). Because transferrin also transports iron, excessive iron reduces zinc absorption, and vice versa. A similar antagonism exists with copper. The concentration <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> in blood plasma stays relatively constant regardless <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> intake. Cells in the salivary gland, prostate, immune system, and intestine use zinc signaling to communicate with other cells.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{formation}} <b>of</b> hollow <b>zinc</b> oxide {{has been}} studied by oxidation and subsequent thermal treatment <b>of</b> nanometer-sized <b>zinc</b> particles using in-situ TEM. The zinc particles produced under UHV condition were exposed to air {{at room temperature for}} 0. 6 ks, which resulted in the formation of oxide layer with thickness of 3 nm. Subsequent heating inside UHV chamber of TEM induced the evaporation <b>of</b> the inner <b>zinc,</b> which resulted in the formation <b>of</b> hollow <b>zinc</b> oxide. The produced hollow zinc oxide had the wurtzite structure. Based upon the vapor pressure <b>of</b> the inner <b>zinc,</b> it seems reasonable to consider that the internal zinc vapor leaks away through the interface between the oxide layer and the amorphous carbon film used as a supporting substrate...|$|R
5|$|Soils {{contaminated}} with zinc from mining, refining, or fertilizing with zinc-bearing sludge can contain several grams <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> per kilogram of dry soil. Levels <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> {{in excess of}} 500ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals, such as iron and manganese. Zinc levels of 2000ppm to 180,000ppm (18%) have been recorded in some soil samples.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{preparations}} <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> {{include those}} {{used on the}} skin, often in the form <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> oxide. Zinc preparations can protect against sunburn {{in the summer and}} windburn in the winter. Applied thinly to a baby's diaper area (perineum) with each diaper change, it can protect against diaper rash.|$|E
5|$|A {{small amount}} of {{industrial}} production involves wet chemical processes, which start with aqueous solutions <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> salts, from which zinc carbonate or zinc hydroxide is precipitated. The solid precipitate is then calcined at temperatures around 800°C.|$|E
40|$|The growth {{kinetics}} <b>of</b> the <b>zinc</b> coating {{formed on}} the surface of casting made from ductile iron grade EN-GJS- 500 - 3 was investigated. To produce homogenous metal matrix in test samples, the normalising and ferritising annealing was carried out. Studies showed a heterogeneous structure of cast iron with varying content of the phases formed. This was followed by hot dip galvanising treatment at 450 °C to capture the growth kinetics <b>of</b> the <b>zinc</b> coating (the time of the treatment ranged from 60 to 600 seconds). Nonlinear estimation of the determined growth kinetics of the alloyed layer <b>of</b> a <b>zinc</b> coating was made and an equation <b>of</b> the <b>zinc</b> coating growth was derived. Based on the results of the investigations it was concluded that thickness <b>of</b> the <b>zinc</b> coating formed {{on the surface}} of casting with a 100 % pearlitic matrix makes 55 % of the thickness of coating formed on the surface in 100 % ferritic...|$|R
30|$|In particular, during discharge, the {{oxidation}} <b>of</b> the <b>zinc</b> electrode {{can involve}} several processes including oxidation <b>of</b> surface <b>zinc</b> atoms, ion solvation in the solution, ion diffusion in the electrolyte and precipitation into a solid phase when the solubility limit is reached.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of zinc-coated copper was {{studied in the}} zinc coating thickness range of 0 - 50 mu m. The microhardness and the adhesion <b>of</b> the <b>zinc</b> coating to the copper substrate were observed to increase with increasing thickness <b>of</b> the <b>zinc</b> coating. The ultimate tensile strength and the fracture strain of the zinc-coated copper were found to increase and to decrease, respectively, with increasing strain rate for a constant value <b>of</b> the <b>zinc</b> coating thickness.

5|$|Cadmium is {{a common}} {{impurity}} in zinc ores, and it is most often isolated during the production <b>of</b> <b>zinc.</b> Some zinc ores concentrates from sulfidic zinc ores contain up to 1.4% of cadmium. In the 1970s, the output of cadmium was 6.5 pounds per ton <b>of</b> <b>zinc.</b> Zinc sulfide ores are roasted {{in the presence of}} oxygen, converting the zinc sulfide to the oxide. Zinc metal is produced either by smelting the oxide with carbon or by electrolysis in sulfuric acid. Cadmium is isolated from the zinc metal by vacuum distillation if the zinc is smelted, or cadmium sulfate is precipitated from the electrolysis solution.|$|E

5|$|The element was {{probably}} {{named by the}} alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.|$|E

5|$|Topical {{and oral}} {{preparations}} of nicotinamide (the amide form of vitamin B3) {{have been suggested}} as alternative medical treatments. It is thought to improve acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties, {{and its ability to}} suppress sebum production, and promote wound healing. Topical and oral preparations <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> have similarly been proposed as effective treatments for acne; evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited. The purported efficacy <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> is attributed to its capacity to reduce inflammation and sebum production, and inhibit P. acnes. Antihistamines may improve symptoms among those already taking isotretinoin due to their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to suppress sebum production.|$|E

5|$|Zinc {{chemistry}} {{is similar to}} the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals, nickel and copper, though it has a filled d-shell and compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless. The ionic radii <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> and magnesium happen to be nearly identical. Because of this some of the equivalent salts have the same crystal structure, and in other circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor, the chemistry <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> has much in common with that of magnesium. In other respects, there is little similarity with the late first-row transition metals. Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors. Complexes <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{white is}} used as a pigment in paints and is more opaque than lithopone, but less opaque than {{titanium}} dioxide. It is also used in coatings for paper. Chinese white is a special grade <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> white used in artists' pigments. The use <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> white (zinc oxide) as a pigment in oil painting started in the middle of 18th century.
