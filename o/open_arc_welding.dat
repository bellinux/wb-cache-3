Other clean processes, such as electron beam welding or laser beam welding, are also acceptable; however, those that involve potential slag inclusions (such as submerged <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and Flux-cored <b>arc</b> <b>welding)</b> are obviously not. To avoid trapping gas or high vapor pressure molecules, welds must fully penetrate the joint or be made from the interior surface.|$|R

50|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} energy necessary for <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> processes, {{a number of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common classification is constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> the voltage {{is directly related to the}} length of the arc, and the current is related to the amount of heat input. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> flux cored <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> and submerged <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b> In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|R
