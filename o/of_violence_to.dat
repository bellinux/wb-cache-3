Although she never advocated violence against whites, she agreed with his course of direct action and supported his goals. Like Tubman, he spoke of being called by God, and trusted the divine to protect him from the wrath of slaveholders. She, meanwhile, claimed to have had a prophetic vision of meeting Brown before their encounter.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Standardized {{quantitative}} methods {{are needed to}} study occurrence and timing <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> in relation <b>to</b> pregnancy and to study {{the context in which}} pregnancy-related violence occurs. METHODS: Data from three published studies <b>of</b> prevalence <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> during pregnancy are used to illustrate ways to measure the association <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> in relation <b>to</b> pregnancy. RESULTS: Four patterns <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> in relation <b>to</b> pregnancy are identified, and related research issues are discussed. Also, 2 population-based surveys that address the suggestions presented here are discussed.

In the episode, Mulder and Scully believe that a serial killer from the 1940s passed his genetic trait <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>to</b> his grandchild after a detective, BJ Morrow (Deborah Strang) mysteriously uncovers the remains of an FBI agent who disappeared almost fifty years before while investigating a modern-day murder case similar to the older cold case.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} {{scholars}} have postulated {{a number of}} theories about what Stowe {{was trying to say}} with the novel (aside from the obvious themes, such as condemning slavery). For example, as an ardent Christian and active abolitionist, Stowe placed many of her religious beliefs into the novel. Some scholars have stated that Stowe saw her novel as offering a solution to the moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Was the use <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>to</b> oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally defensible? Which of Stowe's characters should be emulated, the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris? Stowe's solution was similar to Ralph Waldo Emerson's: God's will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them.|$|E
5|$|Jainism {{is perhaps}} the only {{religion}} {{in the world that}} requires all its adherents to follow a strict vegetarian diet. Vegetarian food that also involves more harm to the living beings such as roots, bulbs, multi seeded vegetables etc. are avoided by strict Jains. The importance of ahimsa manifests in many other ways in the daily life of Jains. For a layperson it means participating in business that results in least amount <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>to</b> living beings. No furs, plumes or silk are worn. Use of leather is kept to a minimum and must in any event be from naturally dead animals. Food is usually eaten during the day unless unavoidable, since there is too much danger of injuring insects in cooking at night. The Jain will not use an open light nor leave a container of liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed; even with this precaution, liquids are always strained before use. Through the ages Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury, and this accounts for the disproportionate number who have entered banking, commerce and other mercantile trades.|$|E

25|$|The last {{third of}} the 20th century saw the {{emergence}} of different insurgent groups in the south.

In 2014, Avellino was charged with ordering two Lucchese family associates to assault a 70-year-old man over a late payment of $100,000 in 2010.

25|$|In 1903 {{a number}} {{of members of the}} NUWSS broke away and, led by Emmeline Pankhurst, formed the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). As the {{national}} media lost interest in the suffrage campaign, the WSPU decided it would use other methods to create publicity. This began in 1905 at a meeting in Manchester's Free Trade Hall where Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon, a member of the newly elected Liberal government, was speaking. As he was talking, Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney of the WSPU constantly shouted out, 'Will the Liberal Government give votes to women?'. When they refused to cease calling out, police were called to evict them and the two suffragettes (as members of the WSPU became known after this incident) were involved in a struggle which ended with them being arrested and charged for assault. When they refused to pay their fine, they were sent to prison for one week, and three days. The British public were shocked and took notice at this use <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>to</b> win the vote for women.|$|E

500|$|It is now {{impossible}} to assess exactly why the First Crusade occurred, although many possible causes {{have been suggested}} by historians. The historiography of the Crusades reflects attempts made by different historians to understand the Crusades' complex causes and justifications.

This first theory claimed that the exportation <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>to</b> the east, and the assistance to the struggling Byzantine Empire were the Crusaders' primary goals, and that the conquest of Jerusalem was more a secondary, popular goal.|$|E
