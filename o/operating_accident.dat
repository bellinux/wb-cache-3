40|$|Available {{models for}} {{predicting}} failure of flawed and unflawed steam generator tubes under normal <b>operating,</b> <b>accident,</b> and severe accident conditions are reviewed. Tests {{conducted in the}} past, though limited, tended {{to show that the}} earlier flow-stress model for part-through-wall axial cracks overestimated the damaging influence of deep cracks. This observation is confirmed by further tests at high temperatures as well as by finite element analysis. A modified correlation for deep cracks can correct this shortcoming of the model. Recent tests have shown that lateral restraint can significantly increase the failure pressure of tubes with unsymmetrical circumferential cracks. This observation is confirmed by finite element analysis. The rate-independent flow stress models that are successful at low temperatures cannot predict the rate sensitive failure behavior of steam generator tubes at high temperatures. Therefore, a creep rupture model for predicting failure is developed and validated by tests under varying temperature and pressure loading expected during severe accidents...|$|E
40|$|Sustainability is a {{priority}} for most transportation and road agencies. Its measurement has progressed from a narrow environmental focus to the assessment of social, environmental, and economic outcomes. Although sealed-road sustainability assessment measures are available, measures have not been developed for unsealed road pavements despite the large networks of unsealed roads in many countries. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop models to capture sustainability measures for unsealed road pavements. This was done by relating unsealed road pavement characteristics to social (accidents and surface friction), environmental (emissions, dust pollution, and loss of resources), and economic (vehicle <b>operating,</b> <b>accident,</b> travel time, and maintenance costs) sustainability outcomes. Existing unsealed road surface characteristic prediction relationships, information presented in life-cycle cost analyses, and emissions studies were used to develop these models for rural unsealed roads. The models that were developed can be used in conjunction with existing pavement performance prediction models in life-cycle assessments, comparison of wearing course types, review of maintenance strategies, climate change consequence predictions, overall network sustainability performance reviews, and in pavement management. This paper contains a brief description of the approach, presents the models developed, and provides a number of examples of the application of the models to produce sustainability outcomes. The applications show that the models can effectively be used to quantify and compare sustainability outcomes. The applications highlight the dominance of aspects such as aggregate hauling distance in sustainability outcomes and the limitations of cost-benefit assessment procedures in which carbon emissions are not considered...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{work performed}} by Argonne National Laboratory on the Steam Generator Tube Integrity Program from {{the inception of}} that program in August 1995 through March 1996. The program is divided into five tasks, namely (1) Assessment of Inspection Reliability, (2) Research on ISI (in-service-inspection) Technology, (3) Research on Degradation Modes and Integrity, (4) Development of Methodology and Technical Requirements for Current and Emerging Regulatory Issues, and (5) Program Management. Under Task 1, progress is reported on the preparation of and evaluation of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques for inspecting a mock-up steam generator for round-robin testing, the development of better ways to correlate burst pressure and leak rate with eddy current (EC) signals, the inspection of sleeved tubes, workshop and training activities, and the evaluation of emerging NDE technology. Under Task 2, results are reported on closed-form solutions and finite element electromagnetic modeling of EC probe response for various probe designs and flaw characteristics. Under Task 3, facilities are being designed and built {{for the production of}} cracked tubes under aggressive and near-prototypical conditions and for the testing of flawed and unflawed tubes under normal <b>operating,</b> <b>accident,</b> and severe accident conditions. In addition, crack behavior and stability are being modeled to provide guidance on test facility design, to develop an improved understanding of the expected rupture behavior of tubes with circumferential cracks, and to predict the behavior of flawed and unflawed tubes under severe accident conditions. Task 4 is concerned with the cracking and failure of tubes that have been repaired by sleeving, and with a review of literature on this subject...|$|E

Among the factors thought to influence Ag transport are grain boundary stoichiometry, SiC grain size and shape, the presence of free silicon, nano-cracks, thermal decomposition, palladium attack, transmutation products, layer thinning and coated particle shape.
