5|$|Alarmed by {{the rapid}} {{collapse}} of the KPA, China's Chairman Mao Zedong ordered the People's Liberation Army's North East Frontier Force to be reorganized into the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) for the upcoming intervention in Korea. Despite Mao's determination to save North Korea from capitulation, the Chinese military leadership expressed doubts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of the Chinese army {{to fight against the}} more modernized US forces. As a compromise, Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign, a bridgehead building operation with limited offensives against only the South Korean forces while avoiding contacts with the US forces.

5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} privacy is one area of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US Electronic Communications Privacy Act places limitations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect that is still under debate as {{to the extent to}} which a company can perform such monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> {{of the immune}} system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E

Almost respondents agreed to these statements with high percentage: 84.3 %, 94.3 % and 81.4 % respectively. These outcomes demonstrate that there is existence of <b>the</b> belief <b>on</b> looking more <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> by <b>the</b> disabled. The disagreed respondents to “CWD are able to be trained in most vocational skills” by PWND and PWD are counted for 1.1 % by PWD and 5.3 % by PWND, and those to statement of “CWD can learn at same rate as CWND” are 5.8 % and 10.5 % respectively.

5|$|De la Colonie {{was one of}} the few to escape, but the Elector of Bavaria {{had lost}} many of his best troops which was to have a {{profound}} effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of the Franco-Bavarian forces to face the Allies in the rest of the campaign. Very few of the men who had defended the Schellenberg rejoined the Elector's and Marsin's army. Included amongst this number, however, were the Comte d'Arco and his second-in-command, the Marquis de Maffei, both of whom later defended Lutzingen at the Battle of Blenheim. Of the 22,000 Allied troops engaged, over 5,000 had become casualties, overwhelming the hospitals that Marlborough had set up in Nördlingen. Amongst the Allied fatalities were six lieutenant-generals, four major-generals, and 28 brigadiers, colonels and lieutenant-colonels, reflecting the exposed positions of senior officers as they led their men forward in the assaults. No other action in the War of the Spanish Succession claimed so many lives of senior officers.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have noted}} {{considerable}} political {{conflict in the}} burghs between the great merchants and craftsmen throughout the period. Merchants attempted to prevent lower crafts and gilds from infringing on their trade, monopolies and political power. Craftsmen attempted to emphasise their importance and to break into disputed areas of economic activity, setting prices and standards of workmanship. In the 15th century a series of statutes cemented the political position of the merchants, with limitations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of residents to influence the composition of burgh councils {{and many of the}} functions of regulation taken on by the bailies. In rural society historians have noted a lack of evidence of widespread unrest similar to that evidenced the Jacquerie of 1358 in France and the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 in England, possibly because there was relatively little of the type of change in agriculture, like the enclosure of common land, that could create widespread resentment before the modern era. Instead a major factor was the willingness of tenants to support their betters in any conflict in which they were involved, for which landlords reciprocated with charity and support. Highland and border society acquired a reputation for lawless activity, particularly the feud. However, more recent interpretations have pointed to the feud as a means of preventing and speedily resolving disputes by forcing arbitration, compensation and resolution.|$|E

5|$|The First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–54) saw the {{development}} of the line of battle, a tactic where ships formed a continuous line to fire broadsides at an enemy. Previously, decisive action in naval engagements had been achieved through boarding and melee, but after the middle of the 17th century tactical doctrine focused more on disabling or sinking an opponent through superior firepower from a distance. This entailed major changes in military doctrines, shipbuilding, and professionalism in European navies from the 1650s onwards. The line of battle favored very large ships that could hold the line in the face of heavy fire, later known as ships of the line. The new tactics also depended <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of strong, centralized governments to maintain large, permanent fleets led by a professional officer corps. The increased power of the state at the expense of individual landowners led to the expansion of armies and navies, and in the late 1660s Sweden embarked on an expansive shipbuilding program.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{is the most}} social of the Carnivora in that it has the largest group sizes and most complex social behaviours. Its social {{organisation}} is unlike {{that of any other}} carnivore, bearing closer resemblance to that of cercopithecine primates (baboons and macaques) with respect to group-size, hierarchical structure, and frequency of social interaction among both kin and unrelated group-mates. However, the social system of the spotted hyena is openly competitive rather than cooperative, with access to kills, mating opportunities and the time of dispersal for males depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to dominate other clan-members. Females provide only for their own cubs rather than assist each other, and males display no paternal care. Spotted hyena society is matriarchal; females are larger than males, and dominate them.|$|E
5|$|Under Maeser's administration, {{the school}} was divided into {{different}} departments based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of students.

The Intermediate Department was for students ages eight to eleven and accepted students graduating from the Primary Department. The higher divisions of the Academy included the Academic Department and the Norman School. The Academic Department offered {{a wide variety of}} classes and allowed a student to specialize in one field, and the Norman School trained teachers. Maeser personally oversaw the Norman School. In addition, Maeser established a daily routine. Opening exercises began at 9 a.m. and classes began at 9:30a.m. Students were allowed 30 minutes for lunch. The school day ended at either 4 or 5 p.m. Over 3,000 different students enrolled at the Academy while Maeser was its principal.|$|E
