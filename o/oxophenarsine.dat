40|$|The {{measurement}} of elemental arsenic in biological material {{is not a}} measure of the potential therapeutic activity of a phenylarsenoxide. It has been known since Ehrlich that the high parasiticidal activity of organic arsenicals depends on the bond between aromatic carbon and metal, {{as well as on the}} nature of side chains on the aromatic ring. Thus, although Eagle (1) was able to show that arsenic as <b>oxophenarsine</b> hydrochloride was antispirochetal at dilution of 1 : 3,- 000, 000 Magnuson and Raulston (2) are careful to point out that the finding of arsenic in tissues and particularly in plasma at this concentration, after adminis-tration of <b>oxophenarsine,</b> does not indicate that a true spirocheticidal level is present since the active component is not really being measured. Several attempts have been made to fill this gap. Using chemical and biologi-cal methods of assay in parallel, both Hawking (3) and Wright and Peters (4) found no correlation between the arsenic level in body fluids and the trypanocidal titer of these fluids. Hawking worked chiefly with the pentavalent trypars-amide, but Wright and Peters used the trivalent <b>oxophenarsine</b> hydrochloride...|$|E
40|$|A Leptomonas {{of insect}} origin was highly {{susceptible}} to several standard trypanocides and leishmanicides in vitro. Resistance was induced {{to some of}} these drugs; clones were isolated from each strain. Cross-resistance patterns of the clones were derived for diamidines, quinapyramine (Antrycide), acriflavin, phenanthridines, and other drugs active against trypanosomes and leishmanias. Clones tested included two each that were resistant to acriflavin, Antrycide, diminazene aceturate (Berenil), and pentamidine and one that was resistant to stilbamidine. Appreciable cross-resistance was evident for all clones. Differences were observed between clones from the same parent strain. Collateral susceptibility towards isometamidium and <b>oxophenarsine</b> was detected in most clone-derived populations. In clones passaged without drug to test for drug fastness, acriflavin and pentamidine clones lost resistance within 10 transfers, whereas Berenil and Antrycide clones retained considerable resistance after 20 to 30 subcultures without drug. Considerations of differences in life cycles suggest that the clone collection may be useful in screening for agents effective against leishmanias and stercorarian trypanosomes rather than against salivary trypanosomes...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{chloroquine}} {{on the growth}} and oxygen consumption of cultured fibroblasts were investigated. 1) Chloroquine diphosphate inhibited the growth of chick embryo heart fibroblasts in tissue culture medium containing 5 γ/dl and also other chloroquine derivatives such as chloroquine diorotate, chloroquine chondroitine sulfate, chloroquine polygalacturonate showed same result in medium containing 2 γ/dl of chloroquine too. 2) Furthermore, chloroquine diphosphate inhibited the growth of L strain cell in tissue culture medium containing 2 γ/dl of chloroquine. 3) Effects of chloroquine on respiratory functions were observed in L strain cells with using Warburg's apparate, showing a decrease of oxygen consumption of the cells in the concertration of 2 γ/dl of chloroquine. 4) Also fibroblast-inhibiting action was observed by administrating several drugs in the cultured chick embryo heart fibroblasts. The growth of the cells was not influenced by ACTH administration but several drugs such as tetrahydroxyquinone, phytonadione or <b>oxophenarsine</b> hydrochloride, arsphenamine sodium as well as prednisolone showed considerably potent fibroblast-inhibiting action. As mentioned above marked inhibition {{of the growth of}} fibroblasts was definitely demonstrated by chloroquine administration and this fibroblast-inhibiting action of chloroquine is thought to be important mechanisum of action to the treatment of bronchial asthma with lung fibrosis...|$|E
