5|$|Carisbrook, the city's former main rugby union venue and {{a former}} Test cricket ground, is at {{the eastern end of}} the suburb between The Glen and the Hillside Railway Workshops. It was the home of Otago Rugby Union until a new stadium opened in North Dunedin (the Forsyth Barr Stadium at University Plaza) in 2011. The new stadium is the new home of the Otago Rugby Union and Highlanders Super Rugby franchise, and met with some {{opposition}} within Dunedin, with objections focusing largely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost.</b> The future of Carisbrook looks bleak, and many of the former facilities {{are in the process of}} being dismantled or removed.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, the IMA {{shifted from}} current {{environmental}} control standards within their exhibition spaces, allowing {{temperature and humidity}} fluctuation of a few degrees {{on either side of}} the suggested standard. The IMA relinquished the standard after concluding that the majority of artworks could sustain a greater range of humidity, so permitting the museum to save <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of energy bills and reduce its carbon footprint.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} {{means of}} paying for the statue was a commemorative coin. In early 1899, the commission sought enactment of legislation granting it an appropriation of $50,000 {{in the form of}} 100,000 commemorative half dollars, that could be sold to the public at a premium. Such a method had helped to finance (though with mixed success) the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Instead, Congress passed and McKinley signed on March 3, 1899, a civil appropriations bill that included provision for 50,000 silver one-dollar pieces to be granted to the commission. The bullion for the striking was to be purchased on the open market and was not to come from the Mint's remaining stocks acquired pursuant to the repealed Sherman Silver Purchase Act, though the Mint would not exhaust its inventory from that legislation until 1904. Congress placed a ceiling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the silver at $25,000. In the event, the United States Treasury bought 38,675.875 troy ounces of silver for $23,032.80. The designs were to be selected by the Mint Director, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.|$|E

5|$|Henry III {{added to}} the {{endowment}} left by Peter des Roches, donating farmland, urban property in Southampton and elsewhere, and spiritual revenues from churches. By 1291, taxation returns show that the abbey had a clear annual revenue of £81, a comfortable income. However, shortly afterwards a period of bad management resulted in the abbey accruing substantial debts, and it was soon almost bankrupt. In 1328 the government was forced to appoint an administrator, John of Mere, to address the crisis. Despite forcing the abbot to apply revenues to debt repayment and to sell many of the estates, the operation was only partly successful. Ten years later the abbey was again appealing to the king for help with a disastrous financial situation. The monks blamed their problems <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of providing hospitality to the many travellers by sea, and the king's sailors who landed at the abbey. The king provided some small grants enabling the abbey to overcome its difficulties but the property sales meant that the abbey's income never recovered and it settled into what {{has been described as}} genteel poverty.|$|E
5|$|The {{series of}} taxes levied on oil {{production}} in Alaska has changed several times since 1977, {{but the overall}} form remains mostly the same. Alaska receives royalties from oil production on state land. The state also has a property tax on oil production structures and transportation (pipeline) property—the only state property tax in Alaska. There is a special corporate income tax on petroleum companies, and the state taxes the amount of petroleum produced. This production tax is levied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of oil at Pump Station 1. To calculate this tax, the state takes {{the market value of}} the oil, subtracts transportation costs (tanker and pipeline tariffs), subtracts production costs, then multiplies the resulting amount per barrel of oil produced each month. The state then takes a percentage of the dollar figure produced.|$|E

Overall, we conclude that the impact of membership is likely to be positive for both parties, but the risks and returns are associated. In other words, Turkey stands to gain more than the EU but it is also the party that will be faced with higher adjustment costs. ...|$|R
