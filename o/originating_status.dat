30|$|In case (1), the {{opinions}} of academics on the statement of origin are very different and can be summarised as follows: both countries should be marked “countries of origin”; the country of origin should be labelled according to the ad valorem rule; nothing “should be marked” but let the market figure out which is preferred by consumers; a standard “one rule fits all” approach cannot be applied, and the actual “impact” varies. The experts from government departments and consumer associations have similar opinions: they prefer to label both countries as countries of origin. However, for applying trade measures, the <b>originating</b> <b>status</b> can be conferred only to one country and could be determined according to the ad valorem rule, while both countries could be marked as countries of origin for ingredients.|$|E
30|$|According to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Rules of Origin, when a good is {{produced}} {{by more than one}} country, the country of origin is the “country where the last substantial transformation has been carried out”. Although WTO member countries agreed that for goods not wholly obtained in one country the criterion for determining the country of origin is the last substantial transformation, the detailed rules for conferring the <b>originating</b> <b>status</b> may vary from country to country when a product is manufactured partially or entirely from non-original (foreign) material. For the same product, the country of origin may be the country where the primary material was produced or where the final processing was carried out, depending on the rules of origin of the importing country. For example, if shrimps are raised in country A and then shelled and frozen in country B, the country of origin of shelled and frozen shrimps is country A under the laws of the USA (USA 2004) because there is no substantial transformation in country B. In contrast, the country of origin of shelled and frozen shrimps is country B according to the regulations of the People’s Republic of China, which has rules for recognising a substantial transformation in country B (The Regulation of the People’s Republic of China on the Rules of Origin for the Goods Imported and Exported 2004; China’s General Administration of Customs 2004).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Background: The {{distribution}} {{and kind of}} rat sarcoma viral oncogenes homolog (RAS) mutations, {{as well as their}} clinical impact on different types of thyroid lesions, vary widely among the different populations studied. We performed a comprehensive mutational survey in the highly related RAS genes HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS in a case series of proliferative thyroid lesions with known BRAF mutational <b>status,</b> <b>originating</b> from an ethnically diverse group. Materials and Methods: Mutational hotspot regions encompassing codons 12, 13, and 61 of the RAS genes were directly sequenced in 381 cases of thyroid lesions. In addition, the putative NRAS hotspot region encompassing codon 97 was sequenced in 36 thyroid lesions. The case series included lesions of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT), nodular goiters, hyperplastic nodules, follicular adenomas (FAs), Hurthle cell variants of FA, papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), follicular variants of PTC (FVPTCs), microcarcinomas of PTC (micro PTCs; tumor size ≤ 1 cm), follicular TCs (FTCs), Hurthle cell variants of FTC, and non-well-differentiated TC...|$|R

All NSP-based assays demonstrated a lower diagnostic specificity when applied to the Zimbabwean sera compared to both published specificities and similar Bayesian specificity estimates derived for the Israeli dataset. In Israel, the disease prevalence was estimated at 23. 9 % (95 % credibility interval: 19. 5 - 28. 8 %), whereas 65. 4 % (59. 0 - 72. 5 %) was found in Zimbabwe.

30|$|In this paper, a new ELN scheme, called (Link Layer <b>originated</b> Explicit Link <b>Status</b> Notification) LL-ELSN, is proposed. LL-ELSN {{does not}} require {{additional}} transmission over a wireless link for loss notification and thus enables accurate detection with minimum delay. This is achieved by exploiting cross-layer design. The key idea of LL-ELSN is to send ELN when a data frame is discarded at the wireless link layer due to excessive retry. Along with ELN, the proposed scheme sends a new information, that is, Explicit Retransmission Start Notification (ERSN), which notifies the TCP sender of {{the start of the}} retransmission process at the wireless link layer, in order to prevent spurious timeouts at the TCP sender. The author also proposes an SACK-based TCP modification, that is, ELN-capable SACK (ESACK), which can handle ELN messages and packet reordering due to the immediate retransmission of a lost packet indicated by ELN. ESACK is designed to avoid consecutive invocation of congestion control when multiple packets of a congestion window are dropped due to congestion. ESACK also mitigates bandwidth waste due to continuous ELN generation in a disconnection by appropriately filtering received ELNs according to their causes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction To date, an {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor-activating mutation is recognized as a genetic hallmark that predicts a good response to treatment with {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. However, there has been less long-term observation of the mutational status within the same patient. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first case report which illustrates the instability of the genetic status of pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells. Case presentation A 64 -year-old Japanese woman with advanced lung adenocarcinoma had been undergoing various anticancer treatments, including epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for seven years. She had been receiving locoregional treatment in addition to systemic treatment. She maintained a good performance status until seven years after the initial diagnosis, although she had local and distant recurrences. We analyzed the genetic status of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene in a series of specimens obtained from various tumor-containing lesions throughout the therapeutic period. The results of the genetic analyses clearly showed that the spatial and temporal genetic heterogeneity of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene <b>status</b> <b>originated</b> from an identical tumor ancestor. Conclusions An alternative paradigm to determine a therapeutic strategy for a patient with lung cancer should be considered given the genetic heterogeneity and instability of tumor cells. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Under the mediaeval manorial system most of {{the area}} became {{classified}} as uncultivated [...] "waste". Part of the Weald Moor, together with the Wrekin, seems to have for a time formed a royal forest known as Vasta Regalis, with Sir Humphrey de Eyton recorded as forest Warden in 1390; the old name was still remembered in a tract of land called [...] "The Gales" [...] {{as late as the}} 19th century.Between the mid 16th and mid 17th centuries, there were a series of lawsuits as attempts were made to drain and enclose sections of the moor, leading to disputes over parish and township boundaries. For example, in 1583 Thomas Cherrington took a neighbouring landowner, Thurston Woodcock, to court alleging that Woodcock had employed [...] "diverse desperate and lewd persons" [...] to dig a drainage ditch across land claimed by Cherrington. Woodcock responded by arguing that the land was waste, and part of Meeson Moor. A good deal of land on the western side of the area was drained and enclosed by Sir Walter Leveson of Lilleshall, proprietor of the manor of Wrockwardine, in the late 16th century, and by the 1650s around 2700 acres of wetland had already been drained and enclosed. Peat digging was carried out on parts of the Moors, and the inhabitants of villages {{on the edge of the}} area, such as Wrockwardine, used some areas as summer pasture under historic rights of common. Wrockwardine's uniquely extensive common rights over the southern and western Weald Moors may have <b>originated</b> in its <b>status</b> as an 11th-century royal manor and administrative centre. By the 17th century the village was linked to the moors by a road whose verges had been enclosed for squatter's cottages, forming a separate settlement known as Long Lane.|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: A low-grade {{systemic}} inflammatory <b>status</b> <b>originating</b> from periodontal infection {{has been}} proposed to explain the association between periodontal disease and systemic conditions, including adverse obstetric outcomes. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of periodontal therapy during pregnancy on the gingival crevicular fluid and serum levels of six cytokines associated with periodontal disease and preterm birth. Material and Methods: A subsample of 60 women (18 – 35 years of age) up to 20 gestational weeks, previously enrolled in a larger randomized clinical trial, was recruited for the present study. Participants were randomly allocated to receive either comprehensive nonsurgical periodontal therapy before 24 gestational weeks (n = 30, test group) or only one appointment for supragingival calculus removal (n = 30, control group). Clinical data, and samples of blood and gingival crevicular fluid, were collected at baseline, at 26 – 28 gestational weeks and 30 d after delivery. The levels of interleukin (IL) - 1 b, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 10, IL- 12 p 70 and tumor necrosis factor-a were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: After treatment, a major reduction in periodontal inflammation was observed in the test group, with bleeding on probing decreasing from 49. 62 % of sites to 11. 66 % of sites (p < 0. 001). Periodontal therapy significantly reduced the levels of IL- 1 b and IL- 8 in gingival crevicular fluid (p < 0. 001). However, no significant effect of therapy was observed on serum cytokine levels. After delivery, the levels of IL- 1 b in the gingival crevicular fluid of the test group were significantly lower than were those in the control group (p < 0. 001), but there were no significant differences between test and control groups regarding serum cytokine levels. Conclusion: Although periodontal therapy during pregnancy successfully reduced periodontal inflammation and gingival crevicular fluid cytokine levels, it did not have a significant impact on serum biomarkers...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of an European Commission sponsored activity, {{an assessment of the}} deterministic safety technology of the ‘post-Chernobyl modernized’ Reactor Bolshoy Moshchnosty Kipyashiy (RBMK) has been completed. The accident analysis, limited to the area of Design Basis Accident, constituted the key subject for the study; events not including the primary circuit were not considered, as well as events <b>originated</b> from plant <b>status</b> different from the nominal operating conditions. Therefore, the notorious Chernobyl Unit 4 event was outside the scope of the investigation. Following the evaluation of {{the current state of the}} art in the area including the identiﬁcation of critical issues, targets for the analysis were established together with suitable chains of computational tools. The outcomes from this part of the study are (a) the list of transient scenarios whose parameter values are assumed to constitute the boundaries for the evolution of any relevant safety transient and; (b) a set of computational tools with characteristics consistent with current technological achievements, suitable for performing safety analyses. The availability of computational tools, including codes, nodalisations and boundary and initial conditions for the Smolensk 3 NPP, brought to their application to the prediction of the selected transient evolutions that, however, are not classiﬁed as licensing studies. The results demonstrated proper safety margins and relatively long time constants associated with the huge values for the ratios between mass of moderator and mass of coolant and unit generated power. The results at the item above, suggested a qualitative, though non rigorous, comparison between accident analysis aspects in LWR and RBMK having the main purpose to show strengths in RBMK safety features heavily criticized not always in a consistent way following the Chernobyl event. The results of supporting analyses for the present paper are discussed in ﬁve companions papers in this Journal volume. The second (over six) and the third paper deal with the RBMK Main Coolant Circuit and Conﬁnement thermal-hydraulic performance, respectively. Key speciﬁc issues in the RBMK safety technology, constituted by addressing of the “Multiple Pressure Tube Rupture (MPTR) ” and by the application of coupled three-dimensional neutron-kinetics thermal-hydraulics, are discussed in the fourth and ﬁfth papers. The proposal to instrument the core channels (ICM = Individual Channel Monitoring) has been formulated in this context and is discussed in the sixth companion paper...|$|R
