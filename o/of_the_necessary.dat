5|$|Although tape {{samplers}} {{had been}} explored in research studios, the first commercially available keyboard-driven tape instruments were built and sold by California-based Harry Chamberlin. The {{concept of the}} Mellotron originated when Chamberlin's sales agent, Bill Fransen, brought two of Chamberlin's Musicmaster 600 instruments to England in 1962 to search for someone who could manufacture 70 matching tape heads for future Chamberlins. He met Frank, Norman and Les Bradley of tape engineering company Bradmatic Ltd, who said they could improve on the original design. The Bradleys subsequently met bandleader Eric Robinson, who agreed to help finance the recording <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> instruments and sounds. Together with the Bradleys and television celebrity David Nixon, they formed a company, Mellotronics, in order to market the instrument. Robinson was particularly enthusiastic about the Mellotron, because he felt it would revitalise his career, which was then on the wane. He arranged the recording sessions at IBC Studios in London, which he co-owned with George Clouston.|$|E
5|$|Between 1965 and 1967, the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration, the United States Bureau of Mines, the United States Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, the United States Geological Survey, and the Pennsylvania Department of Mines and Mineral Industries {{conducted}} a joint {{study on the}} watershed of Black Creek. The {{purpose of the study}} was to deal with water pollution due to acid mine drainage. Geological field work was carried out in the area between October 1965 and December 1965. Core and rock cuttings were done between October 1966 and June 1967. However, this study was ended before all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> scientific investigations were completed.|$|E
5|$|By 1950, 45% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> repairs {{had been}} made to Altes Stadthaus by a few simple expedients such as {{emergency}} roofing. In the immediate post-war years, neither manpower, supplies, nor financing was available to undertake repairs on a larger scale. The reconstruction took place between 1950 and 1955 in five phases; the first focused on building up the courtyard wing on the Stralauer Straße side while the second phase, completed in early 1952, focused on the Stralauer Straße/Judenstraße wing and included construction of additional offices on the fourth floor and a 300-person dining hall with kitchen. However, {{for a number of reasons}} most significant of which was that the building was not the seat of government, the remaining three phases were not carried out. In addition, the reconstruction of Wilhelmine architecture was not a high priority, where as housing was and so funding for the restoration work was not included in the economic plan.|$|E

The vote in 1950 was nine votes for Chandler and seven against, leaving him three votes short <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> three-fourths majority. Chandler asked that the extension be considered again at the owners' meeting on March 12, 1951, but the vote was again 9–7.

Preparation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> documentation for Hebron Church, French's Mill, Yellow Spring Mill, and the Nathaniel and Isaac Kuykendall House began in April 2013, when Governor Earl Ray Tomblin awarded $10,500 to the Hampshire County Commission.

5|$|Muren {{found both}} stop motion and optical effects {{to be too}} {{technically}} challenging and decided that the transformation scene would be a perfect opportunity for ILM to create advances with digital morphing technology. He proposed filming each animal, and the actress doubling for Hayes, and then feeding the images into a computer program developed by Doug Smythe. The program would then create a smooth transition from one stage to another before outputting the result back onto film. Smythe began development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> software in September 1987. By March 1988, the impressive result Muren and fellow designer David Allen achieved what would represent a breakthrough for computer-generated imagery (CGI). The head of ILM's animation department, Wes Takahashi, supervised the film's animation sequences.|$|E

5|$|On July 25, 2013, a {{tentative}} deal was announced which {{will see a}} 20,000-25,000 seat stadium built at Buzzard Point costing $300 million. Following votes by the D.C.

Under the July 2013 deal, the District of Columbia was to have obtained a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> Buzzard Point property from the developer that owned it, in exchange for cash and a government building. D.C. United would kick the $150 million needed to construct the stadium on the city-owned land, which it would rent for 20 to 35 years. Under the deal as revised by D.C. City Council in December 2014, the city would instead pay fair market value for the developer's land, and use eminent domain if a deal could not be reached.|$|E
5|$|Other recent {{developments}} in welding include the 1958 breakthrough of electron beam welding, making deep and narrow welding possible through the concentrated heat source. Following {{the invention of the}} laser in 1960, laser beam welding debuted several decades later, and has proved to be especially useful in high-speed, automated welding. Magnetic pulse welding (MPW) is industrially used since 1967. Friction stir welding was invented in 1991 by Wayne Thomas at The Welding Institute (TWI, UK) and found high-quality applications all over the world. All of these four new processes continue to be quite expensive due the high cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> equipment, and this has limited their applications.|$|E
5|$|Peter Adamson offered {{several more}} {{possible}} lines of criticism. He {{pointed out that}} Avicenna adopts a piecemeal approach to prove the necessary existent, and then derives God's traditional attribute from it one at a time. This makes each of the arguments subject to separate assessments. Some might accept the proof for the necessary existent while rejecting the other arguments; such a critic could still reject the existence of God. Another type of criticism might attack the proof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> existent itself. Such a critic might reject Avicenna's conception of contingency, a starting point in the original proof, {{by saying that the}} universe could just happen to exist without being necessary or contingent on an external cause.|$|E

5|$|Stations {{along the}} three-tracked {{stretch of the}} Culver Line are being renovated until early 2018 (excluding Ditmas Avenue and the {{northbound}} platform of Avenue X, which were rehabilitated in 2015–2016), with the center track being used to bypass closed stations. The Coney Island-bound platforms were rehabiliated between June 7, 2016 and May 1, 2017 (May 8 for Avenue U and Avenue X). During {{the second phase of}} the project, beginning on May 22, 2017, the Manhattan-bound platforms will be closed between Avenue U and 18th Avenue until early 2018. Even after the rehabilitation, though, peak-direction express service between Church Avenue and Kings Highway will not be restored due to limitations caused by current track configurations, as the switches at Kings Highway previously used were removed in the 1990s.

5|$|The {{administration}} {{and management of}} the Vikos–Aoös National Park belongs to two district forest offices, supervised by a forest directorate at the prefecture level. Moreover, the office of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in the village of Papingo plays an essential role in management issues. Apart from government efforts, incentives have been given to local management organizations and the local population to participate in the protection of the park. In the park's core, according to the law, forestry activities, grazing, hunting, and fishing are prohibited. In the peripheral zone there are no such restrictions, but the Forest Service can take any necessary measure for the realization of the aims of the park. Apart from the above-mentioned activities, dangers to the park include land erosion, landslides, and wildfires which threaten the local flora and fauna. Another issue is the impact of tourism in recent decades. On the other hand, extreme geophysical conditions make the construction and maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> infrastructure network, mainly access routes and telecommunications, difficult.|$|E
