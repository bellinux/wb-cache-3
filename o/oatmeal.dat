5|$|The Welsh {{also created}} a dish called Llymru, finely ground <b>oatmeal</b> soaked in water {{for a long time}} before boiling until it solidified. This blancmange styled dish became so popular outside Wales that it got a new name, flummery, as the English couldn't {{pronounce}} the original. A similar dish, sucan, was made with less finely ground <b>oatmeal,</b> making a coarser product.|$|E
5|$|Influenced {{in part by}} the Uncle Remus stories, Mr. Tod {{is longer}} than Potter's earlier tales, and set in the Sawrey {{countryside}} at Bull Banks and <b>Oatmeal</b> Crag, two fields Potter acquired with Castle Farm in 1909. Pen and ink sketches outnumber the watercolors.|$|E
5|$|Maple syrup {{is often}} eaten with pancakes, waffles, French toast, <b>oatmeal</b> or porridge. It {{is also used}} as an {{ingredient}} in baking and as a sweetener or flavouring agent. Culinary experts have praised its unique flavour, although the chemistry responsible is not fully understood.|$|E
5|$|Provisions loaded at {{the outset}} of the voyage {{included}} 6,000 pieces of pork and 4,000 of beef, nine tons of bread, five tons of flour, three tons of sauerkraut, one ton of raisins and sundry quantities of cheese, salt, peas, oil, sugar and <b>oatmeal.</b> Alcohol supplies consisted of 250 barrels of beer, 44 barrels of brandy and 17 barrels of rum.|$|E
5|$|The six {{survivors}} {{buried the}} bodies {{found on the}} beach, then travelled east along the beach, expecting to reach Cape Town. However, after {{four and a half}} days, they realised their error and returned {{to the site of the}} wreck. Here they subsisted off a cask of <b>oatmeal,</b> while trying to effect repairs to the ship's pinnace, which had been washed ashore. They were discovered six days later on 14 June by a farmer's son, who was out hunting.|$|E
5|$|Herring, a fish {{which takes}} well to salting, became a well {{established}} catch; the busiest harbour was Aberystwyth, which reportedly took up to 1,000 barrels of herring {{in a single}} night in 1724. Many other villages also fished for herring, generally between late August and December. Herring, along with mackerel, trout, salmon and sea trout, were the main fishes found in Welsh cuisine. Salmon was abundant and therefore a staple for the poor. Trout, which would dry out quickly when cooked, would be wrapped in leek leaves for cooking, or covered in bacon or <b>oatmeal.</b> Many fish would be served with fennel, which grew wild in abundance in Wales.|$|E
5|$|The North {{is known}} for its often crumbly cheeses, of which Cheshire cheese is the {{earliest}} example. Unlike Southern cheeses like Cheddar, Northern cheeses typically use uncooked milk and a pre-salted curd pressed under enormous weights, resulting in a moist, sharp-tasting cheese. Wensleydale, another crumbly cheese, is unusual in that it is often served as a side to sweet cakes, which are themselves well represented in Northern England. Parkin, an <b>oatmeal</b> cake with black treacle and ginger, is a traditional treat across the North on Bonfire Night, and the fruity scone-like singing hinny and fat rascal are popular in the North East and Yorkshire respectively.|$|E
5|$|With {{the effects}} of the late-2000s {{recession}} reducing breakfast traffic to the stores, Burger King announced that it was making the first wholesale changes to its breakfast line-up in many years. In early 2010, Burger King tested a new group of breakfast products under its new BK Brunch product line; a reintroduced English muffin sandwich, a sandwich featuring ciabatta bread, a pair of breakfast bowls, and a non-alcoholic mimosa. In September, a slightly modified variation of the menu was taken national during one of the largest menu expansions in the company's history. Chief Marketing Officer Mike Kappitt said breakfast produced 12 percent of the company's income, but that was only half of what McDonald's made. Part of the expansion was a major advertising campaign that encouraged people to change their minds about skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment. 3G Capital has continued the expansion of the breakfast program with the introduction of Quaker Oats Company <b>oatmeal</b> to its menu in late 2011. <b>Oatmeal</b> {{has been shown to be}} a popular addition to breakfast menus industry-wide due to its low cost, ease in preparation and perception as a healthy, whole-grain option. Analysts from industry analytic firm Technomic stated that it was a good move for Burger King to add a winning product to its menu, but that it should have tried to be more creative by adding other, similar products such as grits.|$|E
5|$|The Tale of Mr. Tod {{is longer}} than the typical Potter tale with 16 colour {{illustrations}} {{and a series of}} 42 black and white drawings, one illustration per page. The illustrations depict the wider landscape of Near Sawrey: Bull Banks, <b>Oatmeal</b> Crag, and Esthwaite Water. The interior of Mr. Tod's house provided the opportunity to present details of the interiors of village homes. In the frontispiece, Mr. Tod stands on a stone flag floor against a timber wall of muntin and plank construction (interlocking thick and thin vertical panels) covered with a sage-green limewash. A tea caddy, a silver salt, and blue and white willow china decorate his kitchen. The beehive-shaped brick oven was drawn from the one at the Sun Inn in Hawkshead and serves as a place for Brock to hide the bunnies. Emphatic frames in the black and white illustrations give the impression of woodcuts. Potter believed a black frame pulled a picture together and sent back the distance. Potter made the kitchen dim to eliminate some detail of the battle between Tod and Brock.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} revolution {{changed the}} traditional system of agriculture which had existed in Lowland Scotland. Thousands of cottars and tenant farmers migrated from farms and smallholdings {{to the new}} industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh and northern England. Particularly {{after the end of}} the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), Highland landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society. Whereas rents had often been paid in kind, the landlords turned to money rents. They displaced farmers to raise sheep and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans. This was exacerbated after the repeal of the Corn Laws in the mid-nineteenth century, when Britain adopted a free trade policy, and grain imports from America undermined the profitability of crop production. One result of these changes was the Highland Clearances, by which much of the population of the Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the United Kingdom, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. The result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, and further afield to England, Canada, America and Australia. The potato famine of the 1840s, caused by potato blight, which devastated the population of Ireland, reached the Highlands in 1846. Although 150,000 people faced disaster, because their food supply was largely potatoes (with a little herring, <b>oatmeal</b> and milk), they were rescued by an effective emergency relief system that stands in dramatic contrast to the failures of relief in Ireland and prevented a major demographic crisis.|$|E
25|$|Oats have {{numerous}} uses in foods; most commonly, {{they are}} rolled or crushed into <b>oatmeal,</b> or ground into fine oat flour. <b>Oatmeal</b> is chiefly eaten as porridge, {{but may also}} {{be used in a}} variety of baked goods, such as oatcakes, <b>oatmeal</b> cookies and oat bread. Oats are also an ingredient in many cold cereals, in particular muesli and granola.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oatmeal</b> {{was added}} to the breakfast menu on December 27, 2010, after it test-marketed well in Washington, D.C. and some parts of Maryland. In the test market areas, <b>oatmeal</b> started selling in late January 2010.|$|E

25|$|Oats {{are also}} {{occasionally}} used {{in several different}} drinks. In Britain, they are sometimes used for brewing beer. <b>Oatmeal</b> stout is one variety brewed using a percentage of oats for the wort. The more rarely used oat malt is produced by the Thomas Fawcett & Sons Maltings and {{was used in the}} Maclay Oat Malt Stout before Maclays Brewery ceased independent brewing operations. A cold, sweet drink called avena made of ground oats and milk is a popular refreshment throughout Latin America. <b>Oatmeal</b> caudle, made of ale and <b>oatmeal</b> with spices, was a traditional British drink and a favourite of Oliver Cromwell.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, the FDA {{approved}} of {{a claim that}} intake of at least 3.0 g of β-glucan from oats per day decreased absorption of dietary cholesterol and reduced the risk of coronary heart disease. The approved health claim was later amended to include these sources of β-glucan: rolled oats (<b>oatmeal),</b> oat bran, whole oat flour, oatrim, whole grain barley and barley beta-fiber. An example of an allowed label claim: Soluble fiber from foods such as <b>oatmeal,</b> {{as part of a}} diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease. A serving of <b>oatmeal</b> supplies 0.75 grams of the 3.0 g of β-glucan soluble fiber necessary per day to have this effect. The claim language is in the Federal Register 21 CFR 101.81 Health Claims: Soluble fiber from certain foods and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).|$|E
25|$|Parkin – a sweet ginger cake {{which is}} {{different}} from standard ginger cakes in that it includes <b>oatmeal</b> and treacle {{as part of the}} traditional recipe.|$|E
25|$|Often these use {{vegetarian}} haggis {{rather than}} the traditional haggis made from a sheep's stomach stuffed with the chopped up lung, heart and liver of the sheep mixed with <b>oatmeal.</b>|$|E
25|$|In May 2005, Sturm Foods was {{acquired}} by HM Capital Partners. Located in Manawa, Wisconsin, Sturm Foods specializes in manufacturing of bulk goods such as <b>oatmeal</b> and markets several sugar free products under private labels.|$|E

25|$|There are no {{permanent}} effects to people from this condition. Orally administered hydroxyzine, an antihistamine, is sometimes prescribed to treat swimmer's itch and similar dermal allergic reactions. In addition, bathing in <b>oatmeal,</b> baking soda, or Epsom salts {{can also provide}} relief of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Cowell {{typically}} works {{into the}} morning, wakes up at noon and has breakfast in bed. His breakfast consists {{of hot water}} with lemon, papaya juice with lime, <b>oatmeal,</b> tea, and health smoothies. Cowell smokes Kool cigarettes and his favourite beers are Corona and Sapporo.|$|E
25|$|He ate two {{meals a day}} {{and avoided}} snacks. His breakfast, after working out for two hours, {{consisted}} of hard-boiled egg whites, a cup of broth, <b>oatmeal</b> with soy milk, and seasonal fruit. For dinner, {{he and his wife}} typically ate raw vegetables, egg whites, and fish. He did not drink coffee.|$|E
25|$|In 1846, the Highland Potato Famine {{caused a}} crisis in the Highlands and the islands of Western Scotland, an area already {{struggling}} with overpopulation and the upheavals of the Highland Clearances. The deaths from starvation were so high that, in 1848–1849, the government delivered shipments of <b>oatmeal</b> to locations along the western coast to give to starving families.|$|E
25|$|Congee {{is often}} eaten with fried bread sticks known as youtiao. Congee with youtiao is {{commonly}} eaten as breakfast {{in many areas}} in China. Congee can be left watery, or can be drained so it has a texture similar to Western <b>oatmeal</b> porridge. Congee can also be made from brown rice, although this is less common and takes longer to cook.|$|E
25|$|In 1921, factory-made radios {{were very}} expensive. Since less-affluent {{families}} {{could not afford}} to own one, newspapers and magazines carried articles on how to build a crystal radio with common household items. To minimize the cost, many of the plans suggested winding the tuning coil on empty pasteboard containers such as <b>oatmeal</b> boxes, which became a common foundation for homemade radios.|$|E
25|$|Provisions loaded at {{the outset}} of the voyage {{included}} 6,000 pieces of pork and 4,000 of beef, nine tons of bread, five tons of flour, three tons of sauerkraut, one ton of raisins and sundry quantities of cheese, salt, peas, oil, sugar and <b>oatmeal.</b> Alcohol supplies consisted of 250 barrels of beer, 44 barrels of brandy and 17 barrels of rum.|$|E

25|$|The oat (Avena sativa), {{sometimes}} called the common oat, is a species of cereal grain grown for its seed, which is known by the same name (usually in the plural, unlike other cereals and pseudocereals). While oats are {{suitable for human consumption}} as <b>oatmeal</b> and rolled oats, {{one of the most common}} uses is as livestock feed. Oats are a nutrient-rich food associated with lower blood cholesterol when consumed regularly.|$|E
