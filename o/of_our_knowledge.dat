5|$|Internal realism was {{the view}} that, {{although}} {{the world may}} be causally independent of the human mind, {{the structure of the}} world—its division into kinds, individuals and categories—is a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not ontologically independent.

The main surviving texts are the chapters on sea combat (peri naumachias) in the Tactica of Leo the Wise and Nikephoros Ouranos (both drawing extensively from the Naumachiai of Syrianos Magistros and other earlier works), complemented by relevant passages in the De Administrando Imperio of Constantine Porphyrogennetos and other works by Byzantine and Arab writers.|$|E

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{is aimed}} at formulating a moderate version of constructivism, i. e. a constructivism which seeks constructivist interests and themes in connection with non-metaphysical versions of realism in a complementary way, and exploring to some extent its potentials and limits. After giving an overview of contemporary constructivist approaches (ch. 2) I have outlined the essential features of the moderate constructivism, following among others Putnam and Luhmann, with two theses (ch. 3) : 1. The descriptive aspect <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>knowledges</b> {{can be understood as}} a matter within a conceptual framework (so-called external facts within a conceptual framework). 2. The constructive aspect <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>knowledges</b> can be understood in the sense of contingency of the currently used conceptual framework (conceptual relativity). According to the moderate constructivism we need distinguish between two concepts of construction, i. e. in the sense of inalienable dependence <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>knowledges</b> on a conceptual framework on the one hand, in the sense of contingency or selectivity of this framework on the other hand, as well as two concepts of description, i. e. a metaphysical and a non-metaphysical concept. If the first concept of construction is not suited for observing our world, and if the second concept of construction is not derived from the first, then we can say that the usability of the first is for the purpose of empirical research very limited. In other words, the radical-constructivist distinction between construction/description {{in the sense of the}} fundamental constructive character <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>knowledges</b> versus the metaphysical illusion of description is for me something like the Wittgensteins ladder, which one climbs up and then throws away. In this way I have analyzed Glasersfelds concept of viability (ch. 4) : The concept is well justifiable in connection with the absolute, real world, but unsuitable for empirical purpose, for in an empirical research the relationship of subjects or organisms with their observable environments is prominent. And viability in contrast to description in the metaphysical sense is not the same thing as viability in contrast to description in a non-metaphysical sense. In my analysis Maturanas theory of autopoietic systems turns out to be a system of pseudo-empirical statements owing to his undifferentiated conceptual applications (ch. 5) : His main theses such as the autonomy of living systems and the dependency of cognition on organisms result from his conceptual confusing of methodological and object-theoretical matters on the one hand and at the object-theoretical level functional and structural matters on the other hand. His conceptual confusions are an example of the tendency for radical constructivists to emphasize a homology between conditions <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>knowledges</b> and the conditioned through them, i. e. <b>our</b> <b>knowledges,</b> a reducibility <b>of</b> the conditioned to its conditions. With its differentiated handling of concepts such as description and construction, the moderate constructivism offers an alternative way for constructivist endeavours...|$|R

Kant {{reviewing}} the enterprise of Aristotle in modern times has given a complete list of the laws of thought, but it is arbitrary in classification and may be legitimately reduced.

During the 19th century, the vast majority of linguistic work was devoted to reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European or its daughter proto-languages such as Proto-Germanic, and most of the current techniques of linguistic reconstruction in historical linguistics (e.g., the comparative method and the method of internal reconstruction) were developed as a result.
