50|$|This circuit {{consists}} of two stages implemented by SR NAND latches. The input stage (the two latches on the left) processes the clock and data signals to ensure correct input signals for the output stage (the single latch on the right). If the clock is low, both the output signals of the input stage are high regardless of the data input; the <b>output</b> <b>latch</b> is unaffected and it stores the previous state. When the clock signal changes from low to high, {{only one of the}} output voltages (depending on the data signal) goes low and sets/resets the output latch: if D = 0, the lower output becomes low; if D = 1, the upper output becomes low. If the clock signal continues staying high, the outputs keep their states regardless of the data input and force the <b>output</b> <b>latch</b> to stay in the corresponding state as the input logical zero (of the output stage) remains active while the clock is high. Hence the role of the <b>output</b> <b>latch</b> is to store the data only while the clock is low.|$|E
50|$|The three natural masking {{effects in}} combinational logic that {{determine}} whethera {{single event upset}} (SEU) will propagate to become a soft error are electrical masking, logical masking, and temporal (or timing-window) masking.

40|$|As {{cycle time}} of chips shrinks and die size grows, clock skew {{measured}} as {{a fraction of}} the cycle time is increasing. Traditional domino circuits shown in Figure 1 are especially sensitive because skew must be budgeted in both half-cycles. The problem with such domino pipelines is that evaluation starts (indicated by the heavy dashed line) when the clock connected to the first gate in the halfcycle rises but the output needs to be valid before the clock on the <b>output</b> <b>latch</b> falls. In the worst case, the evaluate clock is late and the latch clock is early, decreasing time for logic. Many designers realize that some of the overhead can be reduced by using differential domino (also called dual rail) designs. An SR latch or pipeline latch at the end of dual-rail circuits lessens sensitivity to the falling edge [1].

The auto-zeroed comparators also perform the function of a sample-and-hold circuit. In the proposed 8 -bit semiflash ADC, there are no sample-and-hold circuit, no DAC, no subtraction circuit, and no residue amplifier. As a result, a moderate conversion speed has been combined with a drastically reduced power consumption. The ADC was fabricated in a standard 0. 6 μm double-poly, double-metal CMOS process.

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{analyzing}} bit error rates (BERs) for SFQ circuits and their outputs at GHz speeds will be presented. This method {{was used to}} test four- and six-bit pseudorandom code generators. The code generators were operated in free-run mode, i. e., without a synchronization (Reset) pulse.

The apparatus preferably includes a combinational logic block electrically coupled to a delay element, a <b>latch</b> and an <b>output</b> buffer. In operation, a signal from the combinational logic is electrically coupled to a first input of the latch. In addition, the signal is routed through the delay element to produce a delayed signal. The delayed signal is routed to a second input of the latch. The latch used in the apparatus for preventing SEU preferably includes <b>latch</b> <b>outputs</b> and a feature that the <b>latch</b> <b>outputs</b> will not change state unless both latch inputs are correct. For example, the <b>latch</b> <b>outputs</b> may not change state unless both latch inputs have the same logical state. When a cosmic particle strikes the combinational logic, a transient disturbance with a predetermined length may appear in the signal. However, a function of the delay element is to preferably provide a time delay greater than the length of the transient disturbance.

The DPDET flip-flop uses a split <b>output</b> <b>latch</b> clocked {{by a short}} pulse train. Compared to the previously reported double edge triggered flip-flops, the DPDET flip-flop uses only six transistors with two transistors being clocked, operating correctly under low supply voltage. The total transistors count is reduced to improve speed and power dissipation in flip-flop. The number of transistors is reduced by 40 % to 70 % compared to other double edge triggered flip-flops. Based on 0. 35 um single-poly quad-metal ' CMOS technology, the HSPICE simulation {{results show that the}} operating speed of the DPDET flip-flop is 2. 7 GHz at a 3. 3 V supply voltage. The operating speed of the DPDET flip-flop is increased about 41 % and 49 % in compared with others for 3. 3 V and 2. 5 V supply voltage, respectively.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{importance}} of DFTs in the detection of DRFs in embedded SRAMs have been presented. To illustrate their importance an accurate SRAM simulation model has been build. This model {{was used in the}} implementation of some existing DFT techniques. The proposed SRAM simulation model includes all peripheral circuits but for the timing generation circuit and the data input and <b>output</b> <b>latch.</b> The advantage of this simulation model is that the model can be used for any simulation purpose concerning memory faults in SRAMs. The addition of the address decoder logic was due to the fact that, the address decoder is necessary when multiple cells has to be accessed in parallel by selecting the appropriate wordlines. This model thus presents a complete analog behavior of an SRAM circuit. However the additional address decoder logic also increases the delay of the SRAM to a greater extend. The evaluation of the WWTM, NWRTM and PDWTM DFT techniques have also provided some data as to how efficient these DFT techniques are thereby easing some design decision as to which DFTs can used in the detecting DRFs in the cell array. Since two of these DFT were proven to detect symmetric and asymmetric faults within a reduced test time, they could be used as standards for the evaluation of other exiting and new DFT techniques. The PDWTM DFT was not validated. However we could not based on the obtained results to draw conclusions. Futher simulations should be carried out. Functional tests most specifically the Pause test was shown to be an inefficient test method in the detection of DFRs since the pause time is very long and not known for small R-values. Using DFTs thus reduces the pause time to a greater extend. DFTs are the most preferred test methods for the detection of DRFs. However the efficiency of any DFT for the detection of DRFs can only be justified if it can detect both symmetric and asymmetric defects, {{as was the case with}} two of the DFTs evaluated.
