25|$|The Notre Dame review {{also noted}} that {{benefits}} from the restrictions weren’t enough to address the deep-rooted issues associated with alcohol abuse, and communities in the Valley needed continuing support. In her speech at the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Commission Forum, Perth, 10 August 2009, Oscar stated that Aboriginal leaders in the Valley had taken their first steps {{on the path of}} reconstructing their communities but now needed the government to support them:It is a story of colonisation; the threat of losing <b>our</b> <b>cultural</b> authority to manage our societies; and the despair that has come from that disempowerment.It is a story of grief and trauma and the continued pain of living with grog, drug and violence.It is a story that academics and journalists write about us as though we are victims of history that we can do nothing about. And within their stories about us is an acceptance that the paternal hand of government will determine the nature of our welfare and even the nature of our rights.… I want to tell a different story. It is about how Aboriginal people can be the authors of our stories and not passive and powerless subjects in stories told and written by others.… I want to talk about how the leaders of the Fitzroy Valley in the Kimberley are working together to create a pathway of hope and community vitality and resilience… if our journey of social reconstruction could be measured as a one kilometre track, we have only travelled the first metre.The start of the journey has depended on the leadership of the Aboriginal community but the journey from this point on will largely be shaped by a partnership that we can create and build with governments.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway's {{legacy to}} American {{literature}} is his style: writers who came after him emulated it or avoided it. After his reputation was established {{with the publication}} of The Sun Also Rises, he became the spokesperson for the post–World WarI generation, having established a style to follow. His books were burned in Berlin in 1933, [...] "as being a monument of modern decadence", and disavowed by his parents as [...] "filth". Reynolds asserts the legacy is that [...] " [...] left stories and novels so starkly moving that some have become part of <b>our</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage." ...|$|E
500|$|Next, Albert Goldman (then an English {{professor}} at Columbia University) and author and playwright Gore Vidal debated homosexuality, {{with an emphasis}} on the presence of homosexuals in the creative arts.

[...] Vidal, asserting that homosexuality is as natural as heterosexuality, countered by saying [...] "The United States is living out some mad Protestant nineteenth-century dream of human behavior....I think the so-called breaking of the moral fiber of this country is one of the healthiest things that's begun to happen." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{part of its}} eclecticism, the New Age draws {{ideas from}} many {{different}} cultural and spiritual traditions from across the world, often legitimising this approach by reference to [...] "a very vague claim" [...] about underlying global unity. Certain societies are more usually chosen over others; examples include the ancient Celts, ancient Egyptians, the Essenes, Atlanteans, and ancient extra-terrestrials. As noted by Hammer: [...] "to put it bluntly, no significant spokespersons within the New Age community claim to represent ancient Albanian wisdom, simply because beliefs regarding ancient Albanians {{are not part of}} <b>our</b> <b>cultural</b> stereotypes". According to Hess, these ancient or foreign societies represent an exotic [...] "Other" [...] for New Agers, who are predominantly white Westerners.|$|E
500|$|The {{ruins of}} Glastonbury Abbey were {{purchased}} by the Bath and Wells Diocesan Trust in 1908. The ruins are now the property of and managed by the Glastonbury Abbey trust. On acquiring the site the trust appointed Frederick Bligh Bond to direct an archaeological investigation. Bond discovered the Edgar Chapel, North Porch and St Dunstan's Chapel, however relations with his employers turned sour when he revealed in his 1919 book, The Gates of Remembrance, {{that he had made}} many of his interpretations in collaboration with a psychic medium. He was dismissed by Bishop Armitage Robinson in 1921, because of his use of seances and psychic archaeology but is remembered as the man who [...] "galvanised <b>our</b> <b>cultural</b> understanding of Glastonbury".|$|E
500|$|As {{the first}} major rock star to die of AIDS, Mercury's death {{represented}} an important event {{in the history of}} the disease. In April 1992, the remaining members of Queen founded The Mercury Phoenix Trust and organised The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for AIDS Awareness, to celebrate the life and legacy of Mercury and raise money for AIDS research, which took place on 20 April 1992. The Mercury Phoenix Trust has since raised millions of pounds for various AIDS charities. The tribute concert, which took place at London's Wembley Stadium for an audience of 72,000, featured a wide variety of guests including Robert Plant (of Led Zeppelin), Roger Daltrey (of The Who), Extreme, Elton John, Metallica, David Bowie, Annie Lennox, Tony Iommi (of Black Sabbath), Guns N' Roses, Elizabeth Taylor, George Michael, Def Leppard, Seal, Liza Minnelli, and U2 (via satellite). Elizabeth Taylor spoke of Mercury as [...] "an extraordinary rock star who rushed across <b>our</b> <b>cultural</b> landscape like a comet shooting across the sky". The concert was broadcast live to 76 countries and had an estimated viewing audience of 1billion people.|$|E

500|$|Românul Literar was a {{voice of}} anti-nationalist and anti-traditionalist sentiment, rejecting the school formed around Sămănătorul magazine, and {{promoting}} the Symbolists; its agenda has been summarized as [...] "anti-Sămănătorist", and in step with modern French literature. It played host to many Romanian writers, most of them Romanian Symbolists: Macedonski, Mihail Cruceanu, Mircea Demetriade, Al. Gherghel, Dumitru [...] "Karr" [...] Karnabatt, Eugeniu Sperantia, Caton Theodorian, alongside the epigrammatists Cincinat Pavelescu and I. C. Popescu-Polyclet. Cruceanu, who joined the literary club while still a high school student, recalls being impressed by Caion's status as [...] "a literary historian and critic", [...] "his restrained demeanor and his intelligence, with its inscrutable pursuits." [...] However, Caion seemed [...] "ill and troubled", and had [...] "an unnatural and mean passion for going after those people who had {{made a name for}} themselves in <b>our</b> <b>cultural</b> life", with his [...] "venomous weaponry". Other Symbolists took distance: Moldavian poet and literary reviewer Ștefan Petică made a mockery of Caion, exposing him as a sciolistic amateur.|$|E
500|$|The Kansas City Star {{reported}} in early August 2014 that the team's management is planning discussions with some Native American groups {{to find a}} non-confrontational way to eliminate, or at least reduce, offensive behavior. Amanda Blackhorse, the lead plaintiff in the trademark case against the Washington Redskins, thinks the real solution is a name change for the Chiefs. Native Americans in Phoenix, Arizona picketed at the game between the Chiefs and the Arizona Cardinals, and have asked the Cardinals' management to bar [...] "Redface", the wearing of headdresses and face paint, protesting what they perceive to be a mockery of Native American culture. A protest took place in Minnesota when the Chiefs played the Vikings on October 18, 2015. [...] "The Kansas City Chiefs have flown under the radar," [...] said Norma Renville, {{the executive director of}} Women of Nations Community Advocacy Program and Shelter. [...] "They are contributing to <b>our</b> <b>cultural</b> genocide."

500|$|In May 2007 Time {{magazine}} ran {{an article}} by James Poniewozik titled [...] "Is Shrek Bad for Kids?" [...] which considered the negative effects on children of being raised with fairy tale satires, instead of the original stories. Poniewozik mentioned Hoodwinked! writing, [...] "I thought Hoodwinked! {{and most of the}} Shrek series were hilarious... But even if you ultimately reject their messages, old-school fairy tales are part of <b>our</b> <b>cultural</b> vocabulary. There's something a little sad about kids growing up in a culture where their fairy tales come pre-satirized, the skepticism, critique and revision having been done for them by the mama birds of Hollywood." [...] Cory Edwards wrote into the magazine, expressing his similar sentiments and writing, [...] "As the writer-director of Hoodwinked, it may surprise you that I couldn't agree more with James Poniewozik's article. Even as I was making the film, I asked myself the same question: Are we parodying something that kids should have the chance to experience first, 'un-parodied?' We {{went to great lengths to}} distance our film from Shreks humor (and no, I don't think Shrek considers kids). I would hope that Hoodwinked and its sequels will be seen as trying to do something genuine with its characters, rather than look for the next joke at the expense of innocence. We ALL need the real folklore of fairytales, whether we admit it or not." ...|$|E

[...] "The former head of the CIA recently came here as a tourist with a suitcase full of dollars for <b>our</b> <b>cultural</b> centres and certain newspapers.

[...] Another neoconservative theorist, Mohammad Ali Ramin believes that contemporary western history (e.g. Holocaust) are all fabrications by Jews. He also claimed that Adolf Hitler was a Jew himself.
