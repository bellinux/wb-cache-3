25|$|The {{memorial}} is set {{within a}} garden {{and surrounded by}} iron railings. It is positioned inside the entrance to Martin's Hill, Bromley's first <b>ornamental</b> <b>park.</b> Martin's Hill was ostensibly named after a baker who once resided there. For years, the residents of Bromley promenaded on the hill. In {{the latter half of}} the 1800s, Martin's Hill had a commanding view of the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London. Bromley itself took its name from the broom, a yellow-flowered shrub, that once grew abundantly in the area. In the 1800s, Martin's Hill was one of the last places that still had flowering broom. In 1878, the site was acquired by the Bromley Council; trees and flower beds were planted, and it became an <b>ornamental</b> <b>park.</b>|$|E

[...] The red-brick building was {{on the west side}} of Queen's Park Road. [...] In 1880 a separate parish was established, and preparatory work on the new church started the following year on the opposite side of the road. [...] The site was bought for £900; the foundation stone was laid in 1882 by the Bishop of Chichester, Richard Durnford; and Arthur Blomfield finished the church in 1885, apart from a proposed spire which was never built because of a lack of money. [...] The new St Luke's Church was consecrated on 16 April 1885.

The iron fences and lamps were designed by the architect Gabriel Davioud, who designed all the distinctive <b>ornamental</b> <b>park</b> architecture of Paris during the period, from fountains and temples to gates and fences. The final design consisted of a central avenue one hundred twenty meters wide and 1300 meters long, flanked by sidewalks for pedestrians, riding paths for horsemen, and criss-crossing alleys, shaded by rows of chestnut trees and decorated along its full length by ornamental lawns and gardens with exotic flowers and plants. It was, in fact, {{an extension of the}} Bois de Boulogne, and connected directly with the avenues and paths of the park.|$|E

50|$|The {{fishpond}} {{created by}} Joseph Lowe was enhanced and upgraded to a boating lake that still exists today, the spoil from this extensive excavation {{was used to}} raise the land level for the road. Until flood prevention measures became effective in the 1950s the River Trent had regularly flooded this part of its floodplain after heavy rain. The park was constructed between 1922 and 1926. Boot opened the park in stages {{so there was no}} formal opening. He gave the deeds to the land to Nottingham City Council in 1925, but retained the right to manage it for his lifetime. Boot died in 1931; Nottingham City Council formally adopted the park in 1932. The <b>ornamental</b> <b>park</b> was designed by Percy Richard Morley Horder who designed it in the Victorian municipal manner with areas of planting such as an azalea walk, areas for open air dancing (which was soon change to croquet) and crown green bowling.

Their family crest, the Talbot, is still represented {{in the name of the}} village pub. Iwerne Minster remained in the Bowyer Bower family until 1876, when they sold the estate to George Glyn, 2nd Baron Wolverton. Wolverton had a new house built, designed by Alfred Waterhouse and completed in 1878. A 150 acre <b>ornamental</b> <b>park,</b> including a lake, was also created. James Hainsworth Ismay, second son of Thomas Henry Ismay, bought the estate in 1908; he had a village hall, pump and shelter built, designed clothes for the village children and gave the village shops hand-painted signs, all resulting in the village having a 'model' appearance.
