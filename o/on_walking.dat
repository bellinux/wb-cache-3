The riverside water tower has been preserved in its badly damaged state as a memorial. The town hospital presents an exhibition and reconstruction of the conditions in the building during the battle. At Ovčara, {{the site of the}} massacre is marked by a mass grave and exhibition about the atrocity. Local guides, some of whom lived through the battle, offer tourists the opportunity to visit these and other sites <b>on</b> <b>walking</b> and bicycle tours.|$|E
25|$|Maitland {{became the}} {{lieutenant}} governor of Nova Scotia on 29 Nov. 1828, with the added responsibility of commander-in-chief of the forces in the Atlantic region. He was popular. Certainly, his strongly moral conduct influenced Halifax’s society. By insisting <b>on</b> <b>walking</b> to church, he effectively ended the garrison parades on Sunday, the city’s major social event, and he publicly denounced the open market that day.|$|E

According to Bede, Theodore was greatly impressed by Chad's humility and holiness. This was displayed particularly in his refusal to use a horse: he insisted <b>on</b> <b>walking</b> everywhere. Despite his regard for Chad, Theodore ordered him to ride on long journeys and {{went so far as}} to lift him into the saddle on one occasion.|$|E
25|$|Franciscan {{spirituality is}} {{characterized}} by a life of poverty, love of nature, and charitable deeds towards those in need. St. Francis of Assisi (1182–1226) {{was the son of a}} wealthy merchant. He rejected all of his possessions and founded a community of brothers (friars) who lived in poverty and served the poor. Franciscan prayer recognizes God's presence in the wonder of creation, as expressed in St. Francis' Canticle of the Sun. Franciscan spirituality is focused <b>on</b> <b>walking</b> in Christ's footsteps and sharing one's experience of God.|$|E
25|$|Governments now {{recognize}} {{the benefits of}} walking for {{mental and physical health}} and are actively encouraging it. This growing emphasis <b>on</b> <b>walking</b> has arisen because people walk less nowadays than previously. In the UK, a Department of Transport report found that between 1995/97 and 2005 the average number of walk trips per person fell by 16%, from 292 to 245 per year. Many professionals in local authorities and the NHS are employed to halt this decline by ensuring that the built environment allows people to walk and that there are walking opportunities available to them. Professionals working to encourage walking come mainly from six sectors: health, transport, environment, schools, sport and recreation, and urban design.|$|E

Lumbosacral plexopathy is often caused by recurrence of cancer in the presacral space, and may refer to the external genitalia or perineum. Local recurrence of cancer attached {{to the side of}} the pelvic wall may cause pain in one of the iliac fossae. Pain <b>on</b> <b>walking</b> that confines the patient to bed indicates possible cancer adherence to or invasion of the iliacus muscle. Pain in the hypogastrium (between the navel and pubic bone) is often found in cancers of the uterus and bladder, and sometimes in colorectal cancer especially if infiltrating or attached to either uterus or bladder.|$|E
500|$|The {{sculpture}} {{has served}} as a stop <b>on</b> <b>walking</b> tours of the city, including the Metropolitan Arts Commission's 1987 Portland Public Art walking tour and the 2003 Public Art Conference's walking tour of downtown. On November 7, 2006, Kvinneakt was temporarily removed for renovation of the Transit Mall and installation of the MAX Light Rail along the mall. Its removal was supervised by staff of the Regional Arts & Culture Council. During this time Kvinneakt and other removed works were cleaned and refurbished. In September 2009, the statue was re-sited on SW Sixth Avenue between Alder and Morrison. Representatives from the Regional Arts & Culture Council and the TriMet Public Art Program conducted the unveiling. According to the former organization's public art manager, the sculpture will likely remain in its current location for as long as 30 years.|$|E
500|$|Although Parr had {{requested}} a stretcher, none were ready at the hospital, {{and it did}} not normally keep a stretcher at the emergency room's entrance. Reagan exited the limousine and insisted <b>on</b> <b>walking.</b> Reagan acted casual and smiled at onlookers as he walked in. While he entered the hospital unassisted, once inside the president complained of difficulty breathing, his knees buckled, and he went down on one knee; Parr and others assisted him into the emergency room. The Physician to the President, Daniel Ruge, arrived with Reagan; believing that the president might have had a heart attack, he insisted that the hospital's trauma team, and not he himself or specialists from elsewhere, operate on him as it would treat any other patient. When a hospital employee asked Reagan aide Michael Deaver for the patient's name and address, only when Deaver stated [...] "1600 Pennsylvania" [...] did the worker realize that the President of the United States was in the emergency room.|$|E

30|$|The {{physical}} {{characteristics of the}} walking surface are important elements for an individual {{in the process of}} path selection in the outdoor environment. Pedestrians usually prefers stiff, dense and smooth surfaces over loose, soft and uneven bumpy surfaces as they can support their weight during the mobility process and provide ease of travel at a normal speed. The Lejeune et al. [69] study shows that <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> loose-soil surfaces such as sand requires 2.1 – 2.7 times more human energy expenditure than <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> solid ground at the same speed. Furthermore, Haisman and Goldman [70] stated that the human energy expenditure while <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> difficult terrains and thick bushes may overwhelm human physiological limits in comparison to <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> the smooth surfaces. Walking on rough, uneven and bumpy surfaces requires more energy than <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> a smooth surface. The previous study showed that the cost of walking over rough and bumpy surfaces, such as ploughed fields, is 50  % greater than <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> a smooth surface [64].|$|R
500|$|On May 22, {{four days}} {{after the fall of the}} Muong Khoua {{garrison}}, three of its soldiers—the garrison radio operator Novak and two Laotians—reached the only remaining French outpost in northern Laos, Phong Saly. Bernard Fall recorded in Street Without Joy: [...] "he was only twenty-five years old, but he looked fifty; he kept <b>on</b> <b>walking</b> like an automaton to the centre of the post before he was stopped by some of the men staring at him as at a ghost." [...] Novak and the two other soldiers had spent the four days moving through the jungle of Laos following the defeat of their unit. Two days later, Sergeant Pierre Blondeau also arrived at the outpost. His account detailed 57 hours spent hiding from the Viet Minh before a three-day march without food or navigational aids and then encountering native tribesmen who provided food and a pony, with which he reached the French forces.|$|E

In a letter to her son, she admitted {{that in the last}} week before liberation she had had no food except bread and butter, and no meat for several months. By early December the situation in Athens had far from improved; Communist guerillas (ELAS) were fighting the British for control of the capital. As the fighting continued, Princess Andrew was informed that her husband had died, just as hopes of a post-war reunion of the couple were rising. They had not seen each other since 1939. During the fighting, to the dismay of the British, she insisted <b>on</b> <b>walking</b> the streets distributing rations to policemen and children in contravention of the curfew order. When told that she might have been shot by a stray bullet, she replied [...] "they tell me that you don't hear the shot that kills you and in any case I am deaf. So, why worry about that?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} a long-distance trail through County Wicklow was first {{published}} by J. B. Malone (1914–1989) {{in a series of}} newspaper articles in 1966. Malone had a regular column <b>on</b> <b>walking</b> in Wicklow in the Evening Herald newspaper and had published two books – The Open Road (1950) and Walking in Wicklow (1964) – on the subject as well as contributing to the RTÉ television series Mountain and Meadow (1962). He proposed a circular route, dubbed [...] "The Twelve Days of Wicklow", which he considered to be [...] "a journey comparable to that along the celebrated [...] "Pennine Way" [...] but I would say more varied than its north British counterpart". The route consisted of twelve stages, beginning at Bohernabreena, near Tallaght, Dublin 24 and ending at Stepaside, County Dublin as follows: Bohernabreena to Baltyboys (near Valleymount), via Athdown; Baltyboys to Ballinclea (near Donard), via Hollywood; Ballinclea to Aghavannagh, via Lugnaquilla summit; a rest day at Aghavannagh; Aghavannagh to Tinahely; a circular day route beginning and ending in Tinahely, via Shillelagh; Tinahely to Avoca; Avoca to Glenmalure, via Greenan; Glenmalure to Glendalough; a rest day at Glendalough; Glendalough to Knockree; and Knockree to Stepaside.|$|E

500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{returns from}} Outward Bound manager training—where {{he became more}} [...] "decisive and confident"—hoping for revenge on Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) for commandeering his job during the {{previous}} spring. To do this, Andy sets up a slackline {{in the parking lot}} and makes the employees walk across it, humiliating Nellie as she insists <b>on</b> <b>walking</b> in her heels and fails to keep her balance. After Clark proves that he is talented at balancing, Dwight attempts to one-up him, but ends up failing repeatedly and hurting himself. Eventually, Dwight tries to prove his superiority by riding a bicycle across a tight-rope suspended between the roof and a telephone pole, but the photocopier he is using as a counterweight is not heavy enough and he ends up losing his balance and hanging from the bicycle above the parking lot. Much to his embarrassment, he has to be rescued by a team of firefighters, while Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) mistakenly believes the incident to be a circus act. While everyone is outside crowding around Dwight, Jim calls up his old college friend and tells him that he wants {{to be involved in the}} new business deal, even though he did not have Pam's approval.|$|E
500|$|Harding went to {{bed early}} in the evening of July 27, 1923. Later that night, he called for his physician, Charles E. Sawyer, {{complaining}} of pain in the upper abdomen. Sawyer thought it was a recurrence of a dietary upset, but Dr. Joel T. Boone suspected a heart problem. The next day, as the train rushed to San Francisco, Harding felt better, and when they arrived on the morning of July 29, 1923, he insisted <b>on</b> <b>walking</b> from the train to the car, which rushed him to the Palace Hotel where he suffered a relapse. Doctors found that not only was Harding's heart causing problems, but he also had pneumonia, a serious matter in the days before effective antibiotics. When treated with caffeine and digitalis, Harding seemed to improve. He was pleased when his planned foreign policy address advocating membership in the World Court was released to the press by Hoover and received a favorable reception. By the afternoon of August 2, 1923, doctors allowed Harding to sit up in bed. That evening, about 7:30 pm, he was listening to his wife read him a flattering article about him from The Saturday Evening Post, [...] "A Calm Review of a Calm Man". When she paused to plump his pillows, he said, [...] "That's good, read some more". As Florence Harding resumed, her husband twisted convulsively and collapsed, and she raced to get the doctors. They attempted stimulants, but were unable to revive him, and President Harding {{died of a heart attack}} on August 2, 1923, at the age of 57. His death was initially attributed to a cerebral hemorrhage, as doctors at the time did not generally understand the symptoms of a heart attack.|$|E

40|$|A Wearable Mobility Monitoring System (WMMS) {{can be an}} {{advantageous}} {{device for}} rehabilitation decision-making. This thesis presents the design and evaluation of a proof-of-concept WMMS that uses the BlackBerry Smartphone platform. A Java program was developed for the BlackBerry 9550, using the integrated tri-axial accelerometer, Global Positioning System sensor (GPS), CMOS digital video camera, and timer to identify change-of-state (CoS) among static states, dynamic states, small activity of daily living (ADL) movements, and car riding. Static states included sitting, lying, standing, and taking an elevator. Dynamic states included <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> level ground, <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> stairs, and <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> a ramp. Small activity of daily living movements included bathroom activities, working in the kitchen, and meal preparation. Following feature extraction from the sensor data, two decision trees were used to distinguish CoS and mobility activities. CoS identification subsequently triggered video recording for improved mobility context analysis during post-processing...|$|R
