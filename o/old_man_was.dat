5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E

25|$|By this point, Scrooge {{had become}} {{familiar}} to readers in the United States and Europe. Other Disney {{writers and artists}} besides Barks began using Scrooge in their own stories, including Italian writer Romano Scarpa. Western Publishing, the then-publisher of the Disney crafty comics, started thinking about using Scrooge as a protagonist rather than a supporting character, and then decided to launch Scrooge in his own self-titled comic. Uncle Scrooge #1, featuring the story Only a Poor <b>Old</b> <b>Man,</b> <b>was</b> published in March 1952. This story along with Back to the Klondike, first published a year later in March 1953, became the biggest influences in how Scrooge's character, past, and beliefs would become defined.|$|E

Additionally, the <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>was</b> capable of telepathic communication with the hero and could grant the child magical abilities for short periods of time by researching spells in tomes of forbidden magic. The Old Man's ability to see clairvoyantly also enabled him to sense when certain plot elements were occurring such as the kidnapping of the great fairy or the washing up of useful items by the seashore. These events would be relayed to the hero telepathically.|$|E

[...] As soon as Holmes discovered what was happening, he was able to forbid the payment of his fine as a matter of conscience, though friends attempted to pay for him as well. [...] As a result, Holmes was taken to the town's whipping post on 5 September 1651 and given 30 lashes with a three-corded whip. [...] He told the magistrates, [...] "You have struck me as with roses", and he claimed to have felt no pain during the incident; however, he could only sleep by resting on his knees and elbows for many days afterwards.

500|$|A {{surviving}} portrait {{from this}} time shows the prince in armour, mounted on a white horse and pulling the winged figure of Father Time by the forelock. Art historian John Sheeran suggests this is a classical allusion that signifies opportunity.

When the painting was restored in 1985, the wall and the figure of time were revealed to modern eyes for the first time, having been painted over at some point in the seventeenth century by other hands than Peake's. The painting has also been cut down, the only original canvas edge being that on the left.• ...|$|E

The two drive the horses down into the deeps of Busiltjörn, and all of the horses swim back to land but a large, young, and {{handsome}} grey horse that no one had ever mounted. The grey-bearded old man says that the horse is from [...] "Sleipnir's kin" [...] and that [...] "he must be raised carefully, because he will become better than any other horse."

500|$|Phipps' {{analysis}} is not singular, although his lengthy volumes address {{in detail the}} value of this [...] "school for marshals." [...] In 1895, Richard Phillipson Dunn-Pattison had also singled out the French Revolutionary army as [...] "the finest school the world has yet seen for an apprenticeship in the trade of arms." [...] The resurrection of the ancien regime civil dignity of the marchalate allowed Emperor Napoleon I to strengthen his newly created power. He could reward the most valuable of the generals or soldiers who had held significant commands during the French Revolutionary Wars. The Army of the Rhine and Moselle (and its subsequent incarnations) included five future Marshals of France: Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, its commander-in-chief, Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, and Édouard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier. [...] François Joseph Lefebvre, by 1804 an <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> <b>was</b> named an honorary marshal, but not awarded a field position. [...] Michel Ney, in the 17951799 campaigns an intrepid cavalry commander, came into his own command under the tutelage of Moreau and Massena in the south German and Swiss campaigns. Jean de Dieu Soult had served under Moreau and Massena, becoming the latter's right-hand man during the Swiss campaign of 17991800. Jean Baptiste Bessieres, like Ney, had been a competent and sometimes inspired regimental commander in 1796.
