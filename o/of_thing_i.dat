I was at the camp to-day, and just in one little corner {{this is the sort}} <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> found – The nurse, underfed and overworked, just sinking on to her bed, hardly able to hold herself up, after coping with some thirty typhoid and other patients, with only the untrained help of two Boer girls–cooking as well as nursing to do herself.|$|E

In terms of my ethnicity, always feeling like an outsider, always feeling different ... for me it's about saying, 'Thank you Lord, for giving me the faith to believe in myself when other people had written me off.' I've gone through enough of my life worrying about that kind <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> want to encourage anyone else out there who feels like maybe they can't overcome an obstacle, I feel like I'm living proof ... never lose your faith.

500|$|Tyler {{attended}} the Congressional Schools of Virginia, Breakwater School, and Waynflete School in Portland, Maine, {{before returning to}} New York City with her mother at age 12. She went to York Preparatory in New York City for {{junior high and high}} school after her mother researched the school to accommodate Tyler's ADHD. She graduated in 1995 and left to continue her acting career. [...] When asked about the way she spent her youth, Tyler said: [...] "For me, I didn’t get much of a childhood in my teen years because I’ve been working since I was 14. But that also kept me out of trouble. When everybody was doing acid and partying like crazy, I was at work on a movie in Tuscany... having my own fun, of course, but it was a different kind <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> have no regrets. I love the way my life has gone." ...|$|E

500|$|In May 2005, English actor Daniel Craig stated MGM and {{producers}} Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assured {{him he would}} get the role of Bond, and Matthew Vaughn told reporters MGM offered {{him the opportunity to}} direct the new film, but Eon Productions at that point had not approached either of them. A year beforehand, Craig rejected the idea of starring, as he felt the series had descended into formula; only when he read the script did he become interested. Craig read all of Fleming's novels to prepare for the part, and cited Mossad and British Secret Service agents who served as advisors on the set of Munich as inspiring because, [...] "Bond has just come out of the service and he's a killer. [...] You can see it in their eyes, you know immediately: oh, hello, he's a killer. There's a look. These guys walk into a room and very subtly they check the perimeters for an exit. That's the sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> wanted." ...|$|E
500|$|Mr. McClure tried {{three men}} on this disagreeable task, {{but none of}} them did it very well, so a month ago it was thrust upon me. You may imagine me {{wandering}} around the country grubbing among newspaper files and court records for the next five months. It is the most laborious and sordid work I have ever come upon, and it takes every hour of my time and as much vitality as I can put into it. ... You can't know, never having done it, how such work does sap your poor brain and wring it dry of anything you'd like to pretend was there. I jump about like a squirrel in a cage and wonder how I got here and why I am doing it. I never in my life wanted to do this sort <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> have a clean conscience on that score. Then why am I hammering away at it, I'd like to know? I often wonder whether I shall ever write another line of anything I care to.|$|E

I can’t imagine that he would, but it’s a 'you never know' kind <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> haven’t talked to him in quite a while. I don’t know where he’s at these days. He’ll obviously be more than welcome, and embraced if he does. If he doesn’t, that’s cool too." [...] Flea also spoke about Frusciante by saying [...] "He left us so many great gifts. He’s a phenomenal musician and songwriter who gave so much to our band. All the feelings I have for him not being in the band any more... He really took us to a higher level." [...] Frusciante eventually declined to be present for the Red Hot Chili Peppers' induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April.|$|E

500|$|... "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] is an {{alternative}} rock song that lasts for three minutes and 41 seconds. According to the digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com, the song is composed in the key of G minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute, while Lohan's vocal range spans from F3 to D5. When asked about the lyrical content of the song, Lohan revealed, [...] "A lot of people go through family issues, abuse and that kind <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> think it's important to show that other people go through it. [...] I hope [...] see what I say in the song is, 'I love you,' so many times, that I need him and the crazy things in my life.

500|$|Cody crafted {{the story}} to follow a night that ends in a tragic fire, after which Jennifer is kidnapped and set up as a {{sacrifice}} which goes awry. Jennifer, now possessed by a demon and subsequently altered into a succubus, sets out on a bloody rampage in which she devours boys, and {{it is up to}} Needy to stop her. In sort of a reversal aspect of how puberty changes a girl's life, Jennifer must consume the blood of others once a month or she becomes weak and plain-looking. [...] "It's a meek shall inherit the Earth sort <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> think it's always really satisfying and cathartic to see a character that was previously bullied become super human", said Cody. Cody said the script is not a reflection of any part of her own life, but that she is more like character Needy. [...] "I would say I was more of a Needy than a Jennifer. I was never an Alpha female, and I've never gotten off with bullying other people", she said. [...] "If I had to choose, I was definitely the one being shoved, not the one shoving." ...|$|E
500|$|The cover artwork {{features}} {{porn star}} Janine Lindemulder {{dressed in a}} nurse uniform, pulling on a rubber glove. The band—semi-nude—appear on the back cover with Lindemulder preparing {{for some sort of}} injection. The trio was oblivious to the fact that Lindemulder worked in the porn industry until informed by producer Jerry Finn. The record company had delivered a stack of photos of potential cover girls, and the band members happened to pick Lindemulder. [...] "So it's kind of funny that they've been lumped in with Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit, who play up that kind of pimp lifestyle, because Blink is so not that," [...] remarked Finn. According to Mark Hoppus, they always intended to have a sexy nurse on the cover, and the women considered included [...] models from both Playboy and Janine's employer Vivid Entertainment. David Goldman was the photographer behind the shoot, held March 12, 1999, and did not know the trio before shooting. In 2012, he stated the glove was inspired by the album's working title. [...] "Up until the very last minute, the album was going to be called Turn Your Head and Cough," [...] he said. [...] "And that's why I {{came up with the idea}} of the glove. Obviously an enema is not really a glove type <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> thought it was a good visual." [...] Lindemulder is also featured in the music videos for [...] "What's My Age Again?"

500|$|Hearst was {{reluctant}} to play a character similar to herself, commenting, [...] "I'd never gone in and done as cameo as myself or anything, and I wouldn't do that. Yes, the college is called Hearst…which I thought was funny, and it's certainly not related to publishing." [...] Hearst had never previously accepted roles where {{she was asked to}} play herself, stating that it was a [...] "pathetic attempt to get attention" [...] when other celebrities played themselves or characters similar to themselves. Hearst had heard of Veronica Mars and seen several episodes prior to her appearance; nevertheless, she still needed to talk to Thomas about the series and her character before agreeing to guest star, commenting that she discovered that the character's background was not exceedingly similar to her own life, as [...] "Selma's situation is nothing like anything I've had to deal with." [...] When reading the script for the first time, Hearst was amused by the fact that her character was the heiress to the [...] "Hearst Mart fortune", comparing it to Walmart; she stated, [...] "when I read that in the script, I burst out laughing. It was a spit-take kind <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> almost fell over." [...] When asked whether or not the character would become a recurring one, she responded that the idea had not come up in discussions with the crew. However, she stated that she would accept if given the opportunity, and she particularly enjoyed working with Kristen Bell, Enrico Colantoni, and Ed Begley, Jr..|$|E

[...] Despite concerns over the song's drug references, the key lyric [...] "they trip through the day and waste all their thoughts at night" [...] was kept for the final version.

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} her life, she {{had become}} tired of the rape themes and school-girl roles which were common in her videos, but she enjoyed {{the fact that she was}} getting more {{dominant}} roles in her later AVs. [...] "Making men play along to me is something new so it's fun to do. I think that's the type <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> want to do more of." [...] Nozomi's July, 2002 video release, Popular Actresses Fucking Virgin Boys, was in this genre. As the title implied, the video had Nozomi and two other AV actresses have sex with amateur virgin males, including a college student and a middle-aged man. Her video Home Delivery Call Girl, from August 2002, worked with a similar documentary-style concept. In this case, the actress appears at a male amateur's home to perform sex with him. A posthumously-released compilation DVD released by CineMagic from 2006, entitled La Vie En Nose, includes one of Nozomi's videos from 2002. This was the first in a series of DVDs focusing on a nose fetish, indicating that Nozomi had worked in that genre also.|$|E
2500|$|By {{walking out}} of her contract, Varsi's {{participation}} or consideration to several films were cancelled, including a starring role in The Best of Everything (1959). After leaving Hollywood, Varsi played in several small plays in San Francisco. At some point thereafter, {{she made her way}} to New York long enough to successfully audition for the Actors Studio, which she would attend at least briefly in 1965. As a result of being released from her contract, Varsi returned to film acting in the late 1960s, but by this time she was no longer being offered major film roles. She called the films she made in this period [...] "cheap films of little merit". She furthermore said that although producers were curious, they would not hire her. [...] Her later films include Johnny Got His Gun in 1971, a film which Varsi described as her favorite, and a 1972 ABC-TV [...] "Movie of the Week", titled The People. Of Johnny Got His Gun, the actress said: [...] "This is the kind <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> always wanted to do. It comes very late to me. It's been a long time to wait." [...] She was nervous to play the role, saying: [...] "I felt too inadequate to do [...] It's so intense, the responsibility." ...|$|E
