5|$|When researching for Birds of South Asia, Rasmussen {{examined}} tens {{of thousands}} of bird specimens, since the late S. Dillon Ripley had strongly favoured the use of museum specimens to determine which birds to include. With Robert Prys-Jones of the Natural History Museum, she showed that the decades-old Meinertzhagen fraud was far more extensive than first thought. Many of the 20,000 bird specimens in his collection had been relabelled with regard to where they were collected, and sometimes also remounted. The false documentation delayed the rediscovery of the forest <b>owlet,</b> since previous searches had relied on Meinertzagen's faked records. Rasmussen's successful expedition ignored these and looked in the areas identified by the remaining genuine specimens.|$|E

25|$|There is {{enormous}} variation in body structure amongst insect species. Individuals {{can range from}} 0.3mm (fairyflies) to 30cm across (great <b>owlet</b> moth); have no eyes or many; well-developed wings or none; and legs modified for running, jumping, swimming, or even digging. These modifications allow insects to occupy almost every ecological niche on the planet, except the deep ocean and the Antarctic. This article describes the basic insect body {{and some of the}} major variations of the different body parts; in the process it defines many of the technical terms used to describe insect bodies.|$|E
40|$|Dispersal is a {{fundamental}} aspect of population dynamics, and can have direct implications on processes such as the colonization of habitat patches. Pre-migratory movements, landscape fragmentation, and body condition have all been hypothesized as key factors influencing dispersal in birds, but little direct evidence exists to support these ideas. We used radio-telemetry and supplementary feeding to test if body condition or landscape pattern influenced pre-migratory movements of juvenile Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) in a fragmented landscape. We categorized grassland patches as either large (&# 8805; 95 ha) or small and isolated (&# 8804; 58 ha and &# 8805; 1. 5 km to next nearest grassland patch), and young owls were either provided supplemental food as nestlings or not. <b>Owlets</b> receiving supplemental food and residing in large grassland patches moved a greater maximum distance from their nest than similarly fed <b>owlets</b> residing in small patches (large = 1605 ± 443 m; small = 373 ± 148 m). In contrast, non-supplemented <b>owlets</b> from large and small patches {{did not differ in}} their maximum distance moved from the nest (large = 745 ± 307 m; small 555 ± 286 m). Only two of 32 individuals from small patches moved > 800 m, whereas ten of 23 <b>owlets</b> from large patches moved > 800 m. In addition, <b>owlets</b> from large patches continued to move farther and farther from their nest before migration, whereas <b>owlets</b> in small, isolated patches ultimately move...|$|R

The Protestant Lords of the Congregation rose against {{the rule of}} Mary of Guise, opposed by the French troops commanded by d'Oysel alongside a Scottish army commanded by the former Regent Arran, the Duke of Châtelherault. Pitscottie gives a good account of a stand-off in 1559 across the river Eden, at Cupar Muir in Fife, between the Protestant Lords and d'Oisel and Châtelherault {{in command of the}} French and Scottish army. D'Oysel was swayed by the words of Patrick, Master of Lindsay from joining battle but first rode to the top of Tarvit Hill to spy out the strength of the opposition. Cleutin and Châtelherault then signed an eight-day truce at <b>Owlet</b> Hill or Garliebank on 13 June 1559.|$|E
