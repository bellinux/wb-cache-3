"The {{campaign}} of the Honourable Humphrey Crewe of Leith," [...] said the State Tribune next day, [...] "was inaugurated at the Opera House in Ripton last night before an enthusiastic audience consisting of Mr. Austen Vane, Mr. Thomas Gaylord, Jr., Mr. Hamilton Tooting, two reporters, and seventy-four ladies, who cheered the speaker to the echo. About {{half of these}} ladies were summer residents of Leith {{in charge of the}} well-known social leader, Mrs. Patterson Pomfret,--an organized league which, it is understood, will follow the candidate about the State in the English fashion, kissing the babies and teaching the mothers hygienic cooking and how to <b>ondule</b> the hair." ...|$|E

50|$|Trillium undulatum, {{the painted}} trillium, is a wildflower {{of the genus}} trillium found from Ontario in the north to {{northern}} Georgia {{in the south and}} from Michigan in the west to Nova Scotia in the east. It is also known as painted lady or trille <b>ondulé.</b> It demands strongly acidic, humus-rich soils and tends {{to be found in the}} shade of acid-loving trees such as eastern white pine, red maple, red spruce and balsam fir. Although the soils that support it have low base saturation, this species was found to have relatively high levels of calcium, magnesium, and especially potassium in its foliage.|$|E

This complex is composed of three formations grouped together: the Dolomies, Calcaire <b>Ondulés,</b> and Couches à Myacites formations contain alternating marls, marly dolomites and dolomites (Aichholzer et al. 2015) (Figs.  2, 3, 4). The final Muschelkalk unit is the Grès Coquillier, a shelly sandstone to dolomitic sandstone interbedded with clayey marl beds. As shown in the figures, the wells are affected by fracture zones in the Muschelkalk.|$|R
5000|$|The bowed string {{instrument}} musical technique bariolage ( [...] or, since {{the word is}} a noun rather than an adjective, [...] "odd mixture of colours", from the verb barioler, [...] "to streak with several colors") involves, [...] "the alternation of notes on adjacent strings, {{one of which is}} usually open", exploiting, [...] "the individual timbre of the various strings." [...] This may involve quick alternation between a static note and changing notes, that form a melody either above or below the static note. The static note is usually an open string note, which creates a highly resonant sound. [...] "Bariolage" [...] is a nineteenth-century term for an eighteenth-century violin technique (requiring flexibility in the wrist and forearm), the mechanics of which are not discussed by nineteenth-century writers. The usual bowing technique required, which also may be used separately from bariolage, is called <b>ondulé</b> in French or ondeggiando In Italian. However, it may also be executed with separate bow strokes. In bluegrass fiddling the technique is known as [...] "cross-fingering". Perhaps looking back on what he considered an earlier, less advanced, time, one pedagogue explains that The name bariolage is given to the kind of passage which presents the appearance of disorder and oddness, in that the notes are not played in succession on the same string where one would expect this or when the notes e, a, d, are played not on the same string but alternately with one stopped finger and the open string, or else finally when the open string is played in a position where a stopped note would normally be required.
