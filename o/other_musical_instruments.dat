5|$|Barbra Streisand...and <b>Other</b> <b>Musical</b> <b>Instruments</b> (also called And <b>Other</b> <b>Musical</b> <b>Instruments)</b> is {{the fourteenth}} studio album by American singer Barbra Streisand. It was {{released}} on November 2, 1973 by Columbia Records. The album was made available following a 1973 live television special promoted to improve Streisand's image and sound. With world music as the primary genre, the album's instrumentation varies greatly; even items such as kitchen utensils were used to create melodies and beats. With {{a majority of the}} songs on the album being cover songs, Streisand also re-recorded various tracks that originated earlier in her career. Her manager, Martin Erlichman, was credited as the album's sole and executive producer.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. A critic from Billboard liked Streisand's tone and vocals, but others {{felt as if}} the album was ultimately forgettable. Barbra Streisand...and <b>Other</b> <b>Musical</b> <b>Instruments</b> is Streisand's lowest selling studio album of her entire career; {{it is also one of}} four studio albums released by the singer not to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. However, it peaked in the lower positions of both Canada and the United States. The album was eventually released as a CD in 1989.|$|E

In the Mayan areas, the art disappears in the late pre-Classic, to reappear in the Classic, mostly in the form of whistles and <b>other</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instruments.</b> In a few areas, such as parts of Veracruz, the creation of ceramic figures continued uninterrupted until the Spanish conquest, but as a handcraft, not a formal art.|$|E
25|$|In 1582, Friar Phillipe de Caverell visited Lisbon and {{described}} its customs; he mentions the Portuguese people’s {{love for the}} cittern and <b>other</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instruments.</b> In 1649 was published the catalogue of the Royal Music Library of King John IV of Portugal containing the best known books of cittern music from foreign composers of {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries, in which the complexity and technical difficulty of the pieces allow us to believe that there had been highly skilled players in Portugal.|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} of the guqin Chinese zither is a complex process like any <b>other</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument.</b> However, there is much symbolism {{in the choice of}} materials, the shape or form of the instrument that are important things to consider when creating a qin.|$|R
25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{expedition}} had landed, the Malay migrants from Borneo {{came in contact}} with the native people of the Island, who were called Atis or Agtas. Some writers have interpreted these Atis as Negritos. Other sources present evidence that they were not at all a dwarfed primitive people of Negrito type, but were rather tall, dark-skinned Indonesian type. These native Atis lived in villages of fairly well-constructed houses. They possessed drums and <b>other</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instruments,</b> as well as a variety of weapons and personal adornments, which were much superior to those known among the Negritos.|$|E
25|$|Articulation is {{the process}} by which the joint product of the {{vibrator}} and the resonators is shaped into recognizable speech sounds through the muscular adjustments and movements of the speech organs. These adjustments and movements of the articulators result in verbal communication and thus form the essential difference between the human voice and <b>other</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instruments.</b> Singing without understandable words limits the voice to nonverbal communication. In relation to the physical process of singing, vocal instructors tend to focus more on active articulation as opposed to passive articulation. There are five basic active articulators: the lip ("labial consonants"), the flexible front of the tongue ("coronal consonants"), the middle/back of the tongue ("dorsal consonants"), the root of the tongue together with the epiglottis ("pharyngeal consonants"), and the glottis ("glottal consonants"). These articulators can act independently of each other, and two or more may work together in what is called coarticulation.|$|E
25|$|As a child Sebastian took violin lessons; {{he would}} later learn to play guitar, drums and piano, {{although}} he has had no formal training in these <b>other</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instruments.</b> He attended Paradise Community Church, an Assemblies of God church {{and one of the}} largest churches in Australia, and he became one of their main worship singers. He also sang with the Paradise Community Church Youth Conference Planetshakers, performing both lead and backup vocals for their 2002 and 2003 conferences and albums. (After winning Australian Idol he recorded on two of their albums, Adore in 2004 and Set Me Free in 2005.) Sebastian attended King's Baptist Grammar School. He then began studies in Medical Radiation at the University of South Australia, but left to pursue a career in music. He taught vocals at Temple Christian College and other high schools while also working as a recording engineer and studying Music Technology at the University of Adelaide's Elder School of Music.|$|E

He was born to William and Catherine (FitzSimon) Flood, the Master and Matron of the Lismore Union Workhouse. He had one older sister (Maria), and five brothers (Francis (his twin brother), Patrick, Frederick, George and James (who died in infancy). Flood received his elementary education at his grandfather's (Andrew FitzSimon) boys academy in Lismore, and was given music lessons by his aunt, Elizabeth FitzSimon. He quickly became an accomplished pianist and, {{at the age of}} nine, was invited to give a recital for the Duke of Devonshire at Lismore Castle. He entered Mount Melleray in 1872 and graduated in 1876. During this time, he received private tuition in music from Sir Robert Prescott Stewart (1825–1894) and developed proficiency on <b>other</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instruments.</b> He was organist of St. Peter's Pro-Cathedral in Belfast (1878–82), the Cathedral of the Assumption in Thurles, Co. Tipperary (1882–8), Monaghan Cathedral (1888–94) and St. Aidan's Cathedral, Enniscorthy (from September 1895). A devout Catholic, Flood entered St. Patrick's in Carlow, Co. Carlow and spent several years studying for the priesthood. He taught music at the Jesuit Colleges of Tullabeg, Co. Offaly (1882–4), Clongowes Wood College (from 1884), St MacCartan's College, Monaghan (from 1888), and St. Kieran's College in Kilkenny. During his long residency at Enniscorthy (1895–1928) Flood authored the majority of his musical compositions and historical publications. Flood was awarded an honorary Doctor of Music (DMus) from the Royal University of Ireland in 1907.|$|E
500|$|Commercially unsuccessful, Barbra Streisand...and <b>Other</b> <b>Musical</b> <b>Instruments</b> is Streisand's lowest-selling album {{released}} by Columbia {{and one of}} four studio albums {{that have not been}} certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (the other three being 1969's What About Today?, 2011's What Matters Most, and 2016's [...] ). In the United States, the album debuted on the Billboard 200 at number 146 for the week ending November 24, 1973. Within two weeks it rose 71 places to number 75, before reaching its peak position at number 64 on December 22. It spent a total of sixteen consecutive weeks on the Billboard 200. Paul Grein, writer of the [...] "Chart Beat" [...] column for Billboard, noted that Barbra Streisand...and <b>Other</b> <b>Musical</b> <b>Instruments</b> was one of Streisand's few releases to miss peaking within the top 15 of the chart. Meanwhile, the record entered Canada's chart (compiled by RPM) at number 81 on January 1, 1974. However, it dropped to number 88 the following week and on February 2, 1974, it peaked at number 80, which was also the final publication that the album would appear on, totaling four weeks altogether.|$|E
500|$|The American {{historian}} Retha M.

A remarkable, intelligent, quick-witted young noblewoman... that first drew people into {{conversation with her}} and then amused and entertained them. In short, her energy and vitality made her {{the center of attention}} in any social gathering." [...] Henry VIII's biographer J. J. Scarisbrick adds that Anne [...] "revelled in" [...] the attention she received from her admirers.|$|E
50|$|It {{is widely}} held that, between 1965 and 1985, {{the quality of}} Fender guitars and {{amplifiers}} declined significantly. Encouraged by outraged Fender fans, CBS <b>Musical</b> <b>Instruments</b> division executives executed a leveraged buyout in 1985 and created Fender <b>Musical</b> <b>Instruments</b> Corporation. At the same time, CBS divested itself of Rodgers, along with Steinway and Gemeinhardt, {{all of which were}} purchased by holding company Steinway <b>Musical</b> Properties. The <b>other</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> manufacturing properties were also liquidated.|$|R
50|$|As {{production}} grew, de Kleist approached <b>other</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> {{manufacturers to}} create new instruments under their brands. One of these companies was the Wurlitzer company of Cincinnati, Ohio. Wurlitzer said no to buying any of De Kleist's existing barrel-organ based products, but {{said that they would}} buy a coin-operated piano. As development progressed, in 1903 the business was incorporated as the DeKleist <b>Musical</b> <b>Instrument</b> Manufacturing Company.|$|R

500|$|... "4 Minutes" [...] is an uptempo dance-pop song, {{composed}} in an urban, hip hop style. It incorporates {{the effect of}} a marching band, a clanging beat and instrumentation from a brass that is played in a [...] "scale-like riff", as described by Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone. <b>Other</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> used are foghorns and cow bells. In [...] "4 Minutes", Madonna and Timberlake sing and trade verses, the rhythm moves towards a hard clanging beat as Madonna sings the lines that the [...] "road to hell is paved with good intentions." [...] Madonna and Timberlake start singing the chorus with Timberlake singing the line of [...] "We've only got four minutes to save the world". The track continues in the same momentum in the second verse and second chorus whence the track ends where every beat ceases except for Timbaland's characteristic bhangra beats, the brass riffs and Madonna singing the words [...] "tick-tock" [...] repeatedly, after which it ends.|$|E
500|$|Barbra Streisand...and <b>Other</b> <b>Musical</b> <b>Instruments</b> {{developed}} from her award-winning live television special in 1973 {{with the same}} title. Originally, Streisand had requested that her performance would be accompanied by several of [...] "the world's greatest musicians", with Streisand listing Pablo Casals, Isaac Stern, and James Galway as examples; instead, Columbia Records had her sing the music of different countries. They also made Streisand select one musician to work with for the project, and she picked Ray Charles. Recorded in London, the album was {{released to the public}} several months later. Allison J. Waldman, author of The Barbra Streisand Scrapbook, claimed that the singer used this appearance to [...] "update her image and her music" [...] which would be more appealing for the general public. Promotional efforts for the album included advertisements that described it as [...] "the most special Barbra on record". The photography created for the album cover was tackled by Baron Wolman while Paul Perlow designed the inside cover and liner notes.|$|E
500|$|Barbra Streisand...and <b>Other</b> <b>Musical</b> <b>Instruments</b> {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. In Billboards [...] "Top Album Picks" [...] article, {{the album was}} selected for placement under the [...] "Spotlight" [...] column, where it received a lengthier review. The critic was positive of the release, claiming that Streisand's [...] "fine tones and majestical power are sheer entertainment". The individual selected [...] "Glad to Be Unhappy" [...] {{as one of the}} best ballads in her career. AllMusic's William Ruhlmann awarded it three out of five stars, calling the album [...] "more gimmicky than inventive" [...] and ultimately a [...] "forgettable misstep". He also found her medley of [...] "The World Is a Concerto" [...] and [...] "Make Your Own Kind of Music" [...] to be odd because its instrumentation consisted of sounds created by household appliances. Concluding, Ruhlmann claimed that Streisand's single release of [...] "The Way We Were" [...] helped erase any publicity for the album, which he considered a good thing.|$|E

50|$|Finally, {{the work}} is openly {{dedicated}} to the human voice. The composer's interest is about the voice versatility as superior to any <b>other</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> for sound production, although, as the composer declared, he has been using the voice since the beginning because it was easier than recording natural or urban sounds through old analog means, when new technologies were not available.|$|R
