Sometimes it's about {{the right amount of}} blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that in the back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.|$|E

25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which {{was not the kind}} of cricket I want to watch.

I can't get out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E

25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

500|$|Subsequently, Wainwright paired up with Diane Taylor, {{a former}} Detective Inspector from Greater Manchester Police, {{to create the}} programme, and the {{production}} expanded from Jones and Lindsay's original concept.

You'd last about two weeks". She said, of her time {{as a police officer}} in comparison to portrayals on television, that [...] "reality is much more interesting.

Gwyneth had {{a connection to the}} Cardiff Rift, which later became a central plot device in Torchwood. In response to questions about the similarity of the characters' names, Russell T Davies denied they were connected, stating they are [...] "just two names beginning with [...] "G"." [...] Subsequently however, Davies' 2008 Doctor Who episode [...] "Journey's End" [...] alluded to a familial relationship between the characters (with the Doctor specifically asking if Gwen was a family name and Gwen replying that it was), explaining their physical resemblance as the result of [...] "spatial genetic multiplicity". Eve Myles said of the two characters, [...] "it was never on the cards as such, but something in the back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> always said {{that they were going to}} be connected somehow." [...] Davies explained that the relationship between the characters is not literal, stating that [...] "It's not familial as we understand it" [...] instead characterising spatial genetic multiplicity as [...] "an echo and repetition of physical traits across a Time Rift." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-1984, Madonna met {{producer}} Nile Rodgers at the Power Station studios (now Avatar Studios) in New York. Rodgers initially did {{not want}} Madonna to record [...] "Like a Virgin", as {{he felt that the}} lyric 'like a virgin' was not a terrific hook; according to him it was not an all-time catch phrase. Rogers dismissed the song after hearing the demo, which he thought sounded [...] "really stupid and retarded". Later, Rodgers had second thoughts: [...] "It's weird because I couldn't get it out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> after I played it, even though I didn't really like it. It sounded really bubble-gummy to me, but it grew on me. I really started to like it. [...] But, my first reaction to it was, 'This is really queer.'" [...] Rodgers credits Madonna with recognizing the song's potential. He later said: [...] "I handed my apology to Madonna and said, 'you know... if it's so catchy that it stayed in my head for four days, it must be something. So let's do it.'"

[...] "Annie May", one of Wiggins' songs for House of Music, had Saadiq's backing vocals pre-recorded and then overdubbed to the track's final mix. One of Saadiq's songs for the album, [...] "Me and the Blind Man", was excluded from the final mix because, as Saadiq told Yahoo! Music, [...] "they didn't want anybody playing favorites, so one of my songs had to come off." [...] The recording was a moody blues piece with surrealistic lyrics about lust, longing, and a fictitious blind man's secret powers. Saadiq wanted to show [...] "a darker side... some depth" [...] to listeners with the song. [...] "To me songs like 'Blind Man,' make the whole sound, the House of Music", he remarked. It was featured on an album sampler sent by the group's label to music journalists.|$|E

500|$|Unable {{to return}} to Lichfield Grammar School, Johnson was enrolled, {{with the help of}} Ford and his {{half-brother}} Gregory Hickman, into the King Edward VI grammar school at Stourbridge. The headmaster was John Wentworth, and he took care to work with Johnson on his translation exercises. Because the school was located near Pedmore, Johnson was able {{to spend more time with}} the Fords and get to know his other relatives in the area. During this time he began writing poems and produced many verse translations. However, he spent only six months at Stourbridge before returning once again to his parents' home in 1727. When Boswell was writing his Life of Samuel Johnson, he was told by Johnson's school friend Edmund Hector Johnson's leaving the Stourbridge school was due in part to a fight Johnson and Wentworth had over Latin grammar. For companionship, Johnson spent time with Hector and John Taylor, two of his schoolfriends, and he soon fell in love with Hector's younger sister, Ann. This first love was not to last, and Johnson later claimed to Boswell, [...] "She was the first woman with whom I was in love.

500|$|Salvatore created Drizzt on {{the spur}} of the moment. He was under {{pressure}} to create a sidekick for Wulfgar in the Icewind Dale series. Salvatore had sent an early version of The Crystal Shard (what would become his first published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him that they could not use one of the characters. He asked for time to think, but she was already late for the meeting. Off the top of his head, Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore convinced her it would be fine because he was just a sidekick. She asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do'Urden. She asked if he could spell it, and he said [...] "not a chance". Recalling Drizzt's creation in an interview, Salvatore said, [...] "I don't know where it came from. I guess that Gary Gygax just did such an amazing job in creating the drow elves that something about them got stuck in the back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Thank God!" [...] Although many readers have assumed that Drizzt is based on one of the many Dungeons & Dragons role-playing campaigns that the author has played, this is not the case. Salvatore's main influences were classical literature and works of J. R. R. Tolkien. [...] "I like to think of Drizzt as a cross between Daryth from Darkwalker on Moonshae and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings." [...] Salvatore calls Drizzt [...] "the classic romantic hero—misunderstood, holding to a code of ideals even when the going gets tough, and getting no appreciation for it most of the time." ...|$|E

[...] Gainey found the fan {{reaction to his}} {{first appearance}} [...] "really tough", because [...] "everywhere [...] went people would just give [...] dirty looks and they were like 'What {{are you going to}} do with that boy?'", but he noted this gradually improved after his appearances in season two. Erin Martell from AOL's TV Squad listed Tom in her five [...] "most entertaining guest roles" [...] from the first three seasons, commenting [...] "I am counting his first episode as my favorite. For my money, there was nothing more disturbing than when Gainey showed up out of the blue and uttered the words, 'We're gonna have to take the boy.' I could not get that scene out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> for days after 'Exodus' aired. Ben has made Tom seem relatively less menacing over time, but I have a feeling that the terrifying, bearded sea captain is still in there somewhere." [...] In her review of the season four episode [...] "The Other Woman", Nikki Stafford of Wizard called the return of her [...] "favorite Other" [...] (Tom) a [...] "highlight". Following his posthumous flashback appearance in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", Martell said [...] "Now I feel even worse about his death. He wasn't just one of Ben's scary, Walt-napping minions. He had a heart." [...] Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle thought the revelation that Tom is gay was a [...] "unique and funny twist". Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post noted this revelation [...] "seemed a little oddly placed, kind of like 'Let's make one of our characters gay just for the heck of it' but still it's cool that the show has a perfectly normal (well for an 'Other') not over-the-top gay character." ...|$|E
