5|$|While HIAG only {{partially}} achieved its goals {{of legal and}} economic rehabilitation of Waffen-SS, its propaganda efforts led to the reshaping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> Waffen-SS in popular culture.

5|$|According to Watson, {{the most}} {{dominant}} element in the Rommel myth is Rommel the Superior Soldier, the second being Rommel the Common Man, {{and the last one}} Rommel the Martyr.

5|$|The current archaeological {{situation}} allows {{no closer}} evaluation of Khaba's reign. The seal impressions from Elephantine only prove that this island {{seems to have}} been an important place to visit in Khaba's time. The inscriptions reveal that the seals and their belonging vessels originated from Thinis and that they were registered by the governor of Elephantine. Other seals show the depiction of the goddess Bastet. The Hierakonpolis seal was found in early dynastic ruins of a local Horus temple. It shows traces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> a god, possibly Ash.|$|E

5|$|The {{determinant}} det(A) or |A| of {{a square}} matrix A {{is a number}} encoding certain properties of the matrix. A matrix is invertible {{if and only if}} its determinant is nonzero. Its absolute value equals the area (in R2) or volume (in R3) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the unit square (or cube), while its sign corresponds to the orientation of the corresponding linear map: the determinant is positive if and only if the orientation is preserved.|$|E
5|$|The rank of {{a matrix}} A is {{the maximum number}} of linearly {{independent}} row vectors of the matrix, which is the same as {{the maximum number of}} linearly independent column vectors.

The rank–nullity theorem states that the dimension of the kernel of a matrix plus the rank equals the number of columns of the matrix.|$|E

5|$|By far {{the most}} {{important}} source of symbolism on memorials, however, is Christian imagery and icons. Religious imagery permeated many war memorials, even the secular. The {{most important of these}} symbols was the Christian cross, a widely used symbol of hope and suffering. The cross could take multiple forms, from Catholic designs in France, to Orthodox crosses in eastern Europe. Celtic crosses were popular in Britain and Ireland, partially because they avoided Catholic connotations, although they were considered vulgar by more classical architects such as Blomfield. In France, les croix des bois, wooden crosses, became popular symbols at memorials after Roland Dorgelès's novel of the same name. German memorials made extensive use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the Virgin Mary tending her son Christ, following {{in the tradition of the}} pietà. The crucifixion was also a widely used symbol, as seen in Derwent Wood's Canada's Golgotha, although Christ himself was relatively rarely typically seen on British memorials.|$|E
5|$|To {{create the}} {{original}} label for THB, Star Breweries opted to copy an existing label for a Dutch beer brand called The Holland Beer, which featured {{the image of}} three horses. This was done {{in part because of}} the association between Antsirabe and its history of horse breeding; the brand took the name Three Horses Beer based on this design. The label also features the brand's slogan, Soa Ny Fiarahantsika ("The Pleasure of Being Together"). The labels were originally printed in the Netherlands and shipped to Madagascar before eventually being produced on the local market; THB coasters continue to be produced in Europe. The bottle color and shape and its label have undergone adjustments over time. In 2005, the label was enlarged and the colors brightened. The band around the neck of the bottle was also broadened with the addition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> a medal, in honor of the beer's first international award in 2004. A new logo was adopted for the canned THB before being expanded in 2014 to the 33 cl bottled THB. The new logo features three stylized, outlined white horses, now facing right to represent a focus on the future. Red remains the predominant color.|$|E
5|$|Yuknoom Yich'aak K'ak' succeeded Yuknoom Che'en II, his {{crowning}} on 3 April 686 {{was recorded}} on monuments at Dos Pilas and El Peru. He {{was born in}} 649 and was {{likely to have been}} the son of his predecessor. He already held high office before he was named king and may have been responsible for the major successes of the latter part of Yuknoom Che'en II's reign. He retained the loyalty of K'inich B'alam of El Peru and B'alaj Chan K'awiil of Dos Pilas and gained that of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Chaak in 693, when he was installed on the throne of Naranjo at the age of five. However, the texts on sculpted monuments do not reveal the full complexity of diplomatic activity, as revealed by a painted ceramic vase from Tikal, which depicts an ambassador of Calakmul's king kneeling before the enthroned king of Tikal and delivering tribute. Just four years later, in August 695, the two states were once again at war. Yuknoom Yich'aak K'ak' led his warriors against Jasaw Chan K'awiil I in a catastrophic battle that saw the defeat of Calakmul and the capture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> a Calakmul deity named Yajaw Maan. It is unknown what happened to Yuknoom Yich'aak K'ak'; a stucco sculpture from Tikal shows a captive and the king is mentioned in the accompanying caption but it is not certain if the captive and the king are the same person. This event marked the end of Calakmul's apogee, with diplomatic activity dropping away and fewer cities recognising Calakmul's king as overlord. No stelae remain standing in the site core recording Yuknoom Yich'aal K'ak, although there are some in the Northeast Group and 2 broken stelae were buried in Structure 2.|$|E
