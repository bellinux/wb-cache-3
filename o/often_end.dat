5|$|The {{latter part}} of the 9th century saw a wave of Norse (Viking) {{settlers}} and the subsequent establishment of the Danelaw. The names of hamlets established by these settlers <b>often</b> <b>end</b> in thorpe, which means a farmstead. Examples of such settlements in the Sheffield area are Grimesthorpe, Hackenthorpe, Jordanthorpe, Netherthorpe, Upperthorpe, Waterthorpe, and Woodthorpe. By 918 the Danes south of the Humber had submitted to Edward the Elder, and by 926 Northumbria was under the control of King Æthelstan.|$|E
5|$|In clock-limited sports, games <b>often</b> <b>end</b> with a {{team that}} holds the lead killing the clock rather than {{competing}} aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy. In contrast, again, the clock comes into play even {{in the case of}} multi-day Test and first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss. Baseball offers no such reward for conservative batting.|$|E
5|$|War {{film is a}} film genre {{concerned}} with warfare, typically about naval, air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama. It has been strongly associated with the 20th century. The fateful nature of battle scenes means that war films <b>often</b> <b>end</b> with them. Themes explored include combat, survival and escape, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by war. War films are often categorized by their milieu, such as the Korean War; the most popular subject is the Second World War. The stories told may be fiction, historical drama, or biographical. Critics have noted similarities between the Western and the war film.|$|E

5|$|The smooth, {{thick-walled}} elliptical spores typically measure 7.5–10 by 5–7µm. They have {{a narrow}} germ pore. The mushroom {{does not produce}} a spore print, but the spores are yellow-brown in mass. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are hyaline (translucent), club-shaped, usually four-spored (some are two-spored), and measure 17–21 by 6–8.2µm. Pseudoparaphyses (cells that grow down {{from the roof of}} locules, and <b>often</b> <b>end</b> up connecting the roof and the floor of the locule) are abundant in the gleba; they measure about 16 by 12.5µm. Cystidia are yellowish to brownish, thin-walled, with dimensions of 60–100 by 15–25µm. The peridium is made of two distinct tissue layers. The epicutis comprises narrow, gelatinous interwoven hyphae in a layer that is 15–50µm. Underneath the epicutis is the subcutis, which consists of thin-walled hyphae up to 12µm in diameter. All hyphae are inamyloid, and all have clamp connections.|$|E
25|$|Fantasies are {{occasionally}} dreamed {{by the one}} experiencing limerence. Dreams {{give out}} strong emotion and happiness when experienced, but <b>often</b> <b>end</b> with despair when the subject awakens. Dreams can reawaken strong feelings toward the limerent object after the feelings have declined.|$|E
25|$|The {{implementation}} of citywide maintenance {{strategies such as}} street sweeping programs can also be an effective method in {{improving the quality of}} urban runoff. Street sweeping vacuums collect particles of dust and suspended solids often found in public parking lots and roads that <b>often</b> <b>end</b> up in runoff.|$|E

25|$|E. imperialis {{appear to}} be a shy species when it comes to human interaction. Multiple {{experiments}} done with E. imperialis have all noted that tagging territorial males <b>often</b> <b>end</b> in failure since they leave the vicinity altogether when people walk within 1.5 to 2.0 m of their territories.|$|E
25|$|With {{less than}} a 1000 career diplomats, {{staffing}} is the weak spot of Indian diplomacy. In a fast-changing geopolitical context, India's bilateral relations with influential EU countries (where clear and fast political leadership can be expected) are prioritized over multilateral EU-28 discussions (which besides being lengthy, quite <b>often</b> <b>end</b> in unsatisfying compromises).|$|E
25|$|Adjectival names very <b>often</b> <b>end</b> in the suffixes, -ski, -cki and -dzki (feminine -ska, -cka and -dzka), and are {{considered}} to be either typically Polish or typical for the Polish nobility. In the case of '-ski', it holds true if the surname contains the name of a city, town, village or other geographical location.|$|E

25|$|Another {{dilemma for}} MENA {{democracy}} promotion projects aimed at engaging civil society {{is that they}} <b>often</b> <b>end</b> up selectively working with NGOs that are seen as non-threatening to regimes and not {{in opposition to the}} donor's policy in the region – thus largely ruling out work with Islamist civil society groups for U.S.–funded projects.|$|E
25|$|These {{are fairly}} {{terrestrial}} birds of wet forest floors. They eat snails, insects and similar invertebrate prey. Pittas are mostly solitary and lay {{up to six}} eggs in a large spherical nest in a tree or shrub, or sometimes on the ground. Both parents care for the young. Many species of pittas are migratory, and they <b>often</b> <b>end</b> up in unexpected places like house-gardens during migration.|$|E
25|$|Web sites {{often include}} the banner or pop-up ads. Social {{networking}} sites don't always have ads. In exchange, products have entire pages {{and are able}} to interact with users. Television commercials <b>often</b> <b>end</b> with a spokesperson asking viewers to check out the product website for more information. While briefly popular, print ads included QR codes on them. These QR codes can be scanned by cell phones and computers, sending viewers to the product website. Advertising is beginning to move viewers from the traditional outlets to the electronic ones.|$|E

25|$|In the Philippines, tuna {{driftnet}} fisheries have {{a substantial}} impact on the populations. One tuna fishery alone kills 400 Spinner Dolphin (Stenella longirostris) and Fraser's dolphins (Lagenodelphis hosei) each year. Round-haul nets are an even greater concern with a bycatch of up to 3000 dolphins per year. Dolphins that are bycaught <b>often</b> <b>end</b> up as shark bait for longline fisheries. There is not enough data to conclude total bycatch for the Philippines. Initial assessment indicates that bycatch is not sustainable. Monitoring of dolphin populations and fisheries is urgently needed.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of regions of alternating pigmented and unpigmented skin may not definitively suggest the leopard gene. They {{may not be}} visible due {{to the effects of}} other genes. For example, extensive white markings on the face may mask the {{presence of}} mottling around the eyes and muzzle, and white markings on the legs <b>often</b> <b>end</b> in white hooves. Furthermore, other genes may produce similar conditions: white sclera are associated with broad white face markings, striped hooves with the Silver dapple gene, and freckled skin with the Champagne gene.|$|E
25|$|The Mooninites are two aliens {{from the}} Moon who {{frequently}} appear, serving as primary antagonists and wreaking havoc {{through a series}} of illegal or destructive actions. The Mooninites appear more than most characters outside of the main cast. Other recurring characters have made several appearances, including Oglethorpe and Emory, MC Pee Pants, Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future, and Dr. Wongburger. Episodes <b>often</b> <b>end</b> with the non-canon deaths or injuries of major characters, or destruction to their property (both Carl's and the protagonists' homes have been damaged or destroyed in multiple episodes), only to be restored with no explanation or mention in the following episode.|$|E

25|$|Polluting {{water may}} be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a {{pollutant}} limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter. Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as externalities for which the market cannot account. Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution. Pharmaceuticals consumed by humans <b>often</b> <b>end</b> up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on aquatic life if they bioaccumulate and if they are not biodegradable.|$|E
25|$|With Arthur's dodgy schemes, the duo {{encounter}} undesirable underworld figures, {{many of whom}} Arthur {{deals with}} and many of whom turn nasty, leaving Terry to fight and outwit {{their way out of}} trouble. But for all Arthur's obsession with get-rich-quick schemes, he is never malicious, usually simply being blinded by greed, and the pair <b>often</b> <b>end</b> up putting some other wrong right or helping others in need or who have been done wrong by, even if it proves to be Arthurs's Achilles' heel to his latest scheme fully succeeding. Most of Arthur's schemes fail in the end, owing to his greediness, but he does occasionally have the odd minor victory and puts one over on the law or more serious criminals.|$|E
25|$|Examples of his {{shooting}} ability are {{his goals}} in World Cups against England in 1962 and Bulgaria in 1966. He was {{also able to}} turn on himself at top speed and explode at unusual angles, which he used to great effect. The numerous attacks and goal opportunities he generated through individual plays would <b>often</b> <b>end</b> up in an accurate pass to a teammate {{in a position to}} score. This occurred in the first two of Brazil's goals in the 1958 World Cup final and the second goal against Spain in the 1962 tournament. He was also an excellent header of the ball despite his relatively short stature. He is one of a few players to have scored direct from a corner, a feat he managed to do 4 times in his career.|$|E
