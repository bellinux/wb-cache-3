5000|$|Dr. A. Marc Gillinov {{was born}} in Cleveland, Ohio, United States, and {{attended}} Hawken School, where he was named valedictorian. Dr. Gillinov’s interest in cardio-thoracic surgery began in 1978, after two close family members had heart surgery at The Cleveland Clinic.

50|$|Based on {{the success}} of MRT and the {{availability}} of new technologies in surgical guidance, visualization, robotics, and multi-modality image acquisition, Jolesz conceived the idea for a comprehensive <b>operating</b> <b>suite</b> that included access to many different kinds of imaging and therapy delivery tools in order to prototype new kinds of surgical procedures. Such a system would expand the ability of the surgeon to deliver highly targeted therapy to a patient in a less invasive manner, while better monitoring the efficacy of the treatment during the procedure using intraoperative imaging.|$|E
