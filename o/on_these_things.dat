25|$|But {{while he}} thought <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> behold, the angel of the LORD {{appeared}} unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the main}} {{official}} {{of law in}} the post-Davidian Kingdom of the Scots was the Justiciar. The institution has some Anglo-Norman origins, but in Scotland north of the Forth it represented some form of continuity with an older office. For instance, Mormaer Causantín of Fife is styled judex magnus (i.e. great Brehon), {{and it seems that}} the Justiciarship of Scotia was just a further Latinisation/Normanisation of that position. By the middle of the thirteenth century, responsibility of the Justiciar became fully formalized. He supervised the activity and behaviour of royal sheriffs and sergeants, held courts and reported <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> to the king personally.|$|E

2500|$|The {{large number}} of Prius-owning {{progressive}} celebrities in 2002 prompted The Washington Post to dub hybrids [...] "Hollywood's latest politically correct status symbol". Conservatives called [...] "Prius Patriots" [...] also drive the cars {{because they want to}} contribute to reducing US dependence on foreign oil. A 2007 San Francisco Chronicle article said [...] "Prius Progressives" [...] were becoming an archetype, with American conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh opining that [...] "these liberals think they're ahead of the game <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> and they're just suckers".|$|E
2500|$|The laws of {{the game}} agreed on by the FA members stipulated a maximum length and breadth for the pitch, the {{procedure}} for kicking off, and definition of terms, including goal, throw in, offside. Passing the ball by hand was still permitted provided the ball was caught [...] "fairly or on the first bounce". Despite the specifications of footwear having no [...] "tough nails, iron plates and gutta percha" [...] there were no specific rule on number of players, penalties, foul play or {{the shape of the}} ball; captains of the participating teams were expected to agree <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> prior to the match.|$|E
2500|$|... "Originally I {{had this}} idea {{that it should be}} {{possible}} to create some kind of community around this kind of work, and I think by muddying the titles – not having [...] "you are the composer, you are the arranger, you are the orchestrator" [...] – it just sort of helped us to work more collaboratively. It wasn't that important to me that I had [...] "score by Hans Zimmer" [...] and took sole credit <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> It's like Gladiator: I gave Lisa Gerrard the co-credit because, even though she didn't write the main theme, her presence and contributions were very influential. She was more than just a soloist, and this is why I have such a problem with specific credits." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Newton did accept and acknowledge, in all {{editions of the}} 'Principia', that Hooke (but not {{exclusively}} Hooke) had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system. [...] Newton acknowledged Wren, Hooke and Halley in this connection in the Scholium to Proposition 4 in Book 1. Newton also acknowledged to Halley that his correspondence with Hooke in 1679–80 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomical matters, {{but that did not}} mean, according to Newton, that Hooke had told Newton anything new or original: [...] "yet am I not beholden to him for any light into that business but only for the diversion he gave me from my other studies to think <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> & for his dogmaticalness in writing as if he had found the motion in the Ellipsis, which inclined me to try it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1924, the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} {{that the number of}} feature films produced from the original stories or adaptations of Mr. Sullivan totaled 311 in eight years. [...] The Times noted: [...] "This record undoubtedly is unrivaled among screen authors. [...] Mr. Sullivan's work is all the more remarkable because of the recognition which it has achieved for unvarying quality and variety." [...] At that time, Sullivan described the rule he applied in the selection of a story for the screen:"Is it human, is it true to life, is it sincere? If you can conscientiously satisfy yourself <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> you won't have to worry as to whether the public will like the story or not. [...] If you are genuinely moved by it, you may be sure that the public will respond in like manner. ... Give the public a story that touches the heart and is true to life, and, to paraphrase Emerson, 'the world will make a beaten path to the theater box office.'" ...|$|E

I do know that {{for the amount of}} stuff we're putting in here, it is certainly not a bad deal. There are literally thousands of hours of content in this game. It doesn't seem like a crazy price to me. But again, I have no idea what the proper margins are. If someone is saying 'What am I going to buy this month?' in November, I hope that our game is the one they pick out, because we're offering something that nothing else on the market is. But if they don't, I totally understand. There's a lot of really cool stuff. What I'm hoping is that as time goes <b>on...</b> <b>These</b> <b>things</b> are still {{going to be on the}} shelf, it's not like we're taking it away. Maybe they don't buy it day one, but maybe they buy it in February? Maybe they buy it in March? We're not going away, and obviously people want to play things the day they come out, if they possibly can, but sometimes they can't." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{background}} {{described above}} shows there was basis for Newton to deny deriving the inverse square law from Hooke. On the other hand, Newton did accept and acknowledge, in all {{editions of the}} Principia, that Hooke (but not exclusively Hooke) had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system. Newton acknowledged Wren, Hooke and Halley in this connection in the Scholium to Proposition 4 in Book 1. Newton also acknowledged to Halley that his correspondence with Hooke in 1679–80 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomical matters, {{but that did not}} mean, according to Newton, that Hooke had told Newton anything new or original: [...] "yet am I not beholden to him for any light into that business but only for the diversion he gave me from my other studies to think <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> & for his dogmaticalness in writing as if he had found the motion in the Ellipsis, which inclined me to try it ...".) [...] Newton's reawakening interest in astronomy received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680/1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed.|$|E
2500|$|The Industrial Revolution was {{beginning}} in the period between the writing and publication of A Tale of a Tub, though {{no one at the}} time would have known this. What Englishmen did know, however, was that what they called [...] "trade" [...] was on the rise. Merchants, importers/exporters, and [...] "stock jobbers" [...] were growing very wealthy. It was becoming more common to find members of the aristocracy with less money than members of the trading class. Those on the rise in the middle class professions were perceived as being more likely to be dissenters than members of the other classes were, and such institutions as the stock exchange and Lloyd's of London were founded by Puritan traders. Members of these classes were also widely ridiculed as attempting to pretend to learning and manners that they had no right to. Further, these [...] "new men" [...] were not, by and large, the product of the universities nor the traditional secondary schools. Consequently, these now wealthy individuals were not conversant in Latin, were not enamored of the classics, and were not inclined to put much value <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Theodoret writes [...] "Malachi {{teaches us}} how, when Antichrist shall presume <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> the great Elias shall appear, {{preaching to the}} Jews the coming of Christ: and he shall convert many, {{for this is the}} meaning of, [...] "he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children," [...] i. e., the Jews (for these he calls fathers, as being older in knowledge) to those who {{believed}} from the Gentiles. They who shall believe through the preaching of the great Elias, and shall join themselves to the Gentiles who seized the salvation sent to them, shall become one church. He hints, how when these things are done by Antichrist, Michael the Archangel will set all in motion, that Elias should come and foreannounce the coming of the Lord that the then Jews may obtain salvation." [...] And on this place, [...] "Knowing well, that they would neither obey the law, nor receive Him when He came, but would deliver Him to be crucified, He promises them, in His unspeakable love for man, that He will again send Elias as a herald of salvation, 'Lo, I will send you Elias the Tishbite.' And signifying the time, He added, 'Before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come:' He named the Day of His Second Coming. But He teaches us, what the great Elias shall do, when he comes, 'Who shall bring back the heart of the father to the son' etc. And pointing out the end, for which Elias should first come, 'Lest I come and smite the earth utterly.' For lest, finding you all in unbelief, I send you all to that endless punishment, Elias will first come, and will persuade you, O Jews, to unite you indissolubly with those, who from the Gentiles believe in Me, and to be united to My one Church." ...|$|E

Grace had been the first to see him, and involuntarily exclaimed, [...] "There he is--and a new horse!" ...|$|R

5000|$|While Celeste did {{not provide}} any {{specifics}} <b>on</b> when <b>these</b> <b>things</b> would happen, he gave a variety of vague predictions, some of which follow. Americans will adapt to lower standards of living and will travel less, both {{on a daily basis}} and for vacations. Higher fuel costs, advances in telecommuting and an aging American population will push many more people to work from home or close to home. Walking-distance communities will be constructed and will become popular. (T.J. Summer 08, pg. 7) ...|$|R
