25|$|In computing, a Digital <b>Object</b> <b>Identifier</b> or DOI is a {{persistent}} identifier or handle used to uniquely identify objects, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). An {{implementation of the}} Handle System, DOIs are in wide use mainly to identify academic, professional, and government information, such as journal articles, research reports and data sets, and official publications though they also {{have been used to}} identify other types of information resources, such as commercial videos.|$|E
25|$|The DOI {{system is}} an {{international}} standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization in its technical committee on identification and description, TC46/SC9. The Draft International Standard ISO/DIS 26324, Information and documentation – Digital <b>Object</b> <b>Identifier</b> System met the ISO requirements for approval. The relevant ISO Working Group later submitted an edited version to ISO for distribution as an FDIS (Final Draft International Standard) ballot, which was approved by 100% of those voting in a ballot closing on 15 November 2010. The final standard was published on 23 April 2012.|$|E

25|$|AGU co-published (along {{with the}} AMS and the AAG) its first {{electronic}} journal, Earth Interactions, in 1997. It started its own electronic journal, Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, in December 1999. It made a full transition to electronic publishing in 2001. For all its journals, the electronic version became {{the publication of}} record. This {{was accompanied by a}} new identification scheme for articles that entirely did away with sequential page numbers. Instead, each article had a digital <b>object</b> <b>identifier</b> (DOI). As an example, 10.1029/2001GL014304 consists of the publisher identifier (AGU), the year (2001), the journal code (GL), and an article number (014304). This new system was met with complaints from libraries and scientists. The article numbers provided no clue for libraries to find an article in printed versions, and even scientific databases were not set up to handle DOIs. AGU officials claimed that the problems were a temporary cost of being a frontrunner, but did retroactively assign each article a four-digit article number.|$|E

We present in this paper version management facilities that allow scientific databases to achieve a balance between stable <b>object</b> <b>identifiers</b> and evolving data. 1 Introduction Scientific databases are increasingly being used to accession objects representing the results of scientific inquiry, such as genes and DNA sequences. Accessioning involves providing these <b>objects</b> with stable <b>identifiers</b> that can be included as references in publications (e. g., journal papers) and other scientific databases. This requirement for stable <b>object</b> <b>identifiers</b> can conflict with the tendency of scientific data to evolve over time. By t [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Object-based systems present {{particular}} {{challenges for}} state space ex-ploration. Objects can be dynamically created and discarded, {{and can be}} refer-enced via <b>object</b> <b>identifiers.</b> Consistent relabelling of <b>object</b> <b>identifiers</b> in a state leads to a state that is superficially different but behaviourally equivalent to the original. Similarly, object-based systems can include garbage which has no ef-fect on subsequent behaviour but which results in unnecessary differentiation of states. Both of these factors can lead to state space explosion. This paper considers state space exploration for object-based systems based on the Petri Net formalism. It addresses the above issues by using both equivalence reduction and the sweep-line technique. Experimental results are presented for a simple case study of a communication protocol. ...|$|R
