However, ISD was not available from coin boxes until July 1982 when POA boxes were replaced with Post Office CT22B type electronic payphones. In 1979 the Board introduced a Motorola single channel <b>radio</b> <b>paging</b> <b>system,</b> which was upgraded to a two channel system. It is now operated by the Jersey Airport Department of Electronics.|$|R
50|$|Early <b>radio</b> <b>paging</b> <b>systems</b> {{such as the}} Bell Telephone BELLBOY {{system used}} a shared carrier {{frequency}} and audio tone coding to identify the correct recipient of a message. These selectors used a tuning fork resonator rather than a simple single reed. This gives a more selective mechanical filter, allowing more frequencies to be spaced closely together. Even more importantly, the false-triggering harmonic for a tuning fork is more than six times its natural frequency, rather than merely twice its frequency, as for a reed. This means that the useful frequency range is over two octaves, rather than less than one octave. Multiple reeds {{could also be used}} together, either to identify separate frequencies to give multiple indications, or logically ANDed together to require more subscriber selections with a 2-code identifier rather than a single code.|$|R

5000|$|In 1962 the Bell System—the U.S. {{telephone}} monopoly colloquially {{known as}} [...] "Ma Bell"—presented its Bellboy <b>radio</b> <b>paging</b> <b>system</b> at the Seattle World's Fair. Bellboy {{was the first}} commercial <b>system</b> for personal <b>paging.</b> It also marked {{one of the first}} consumer applications of the transistor (invented by Bell Labs in 1947), for which three Bell Labs inventors received a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956. Solid-state circuitry enabled the Bellboy pager, {{about the size of a}} small TV remote device, to fit into a customer's pocket or purse, quite a feat at that time. The Bellboy was a terminal that notified the user when someone was trying to call them. When the person received an audible signal (a buzz) on the pager, he found a telephone and called the service centre, which informed him of the caller's message. Bell System Bellboy radio pagers each used three reed receiver relays, each relay tuned to one of 33 different frequencies, selectively ringing a particular customer when all three relays were activated at the same time—a precursor of DTMF. The ReFLEX protocol was developed in the mid-1990s.|$|R
40|$|As the <b>radio</b> <b>paging</b> <b>system</b> is {{upgraded}} from POCSAG to {{the high}} speed FLEX or ERMES protocol, both the modulation level and the baud rate are increased. What is unchanged is the available bandwidth. Consequently, the modulation index is decreased and additional difficulties are imposed {{on the design of}} a direct-conversion receiver. The main problems are (1) there are no mature demodulation techniques available for zero-IF M-ary FSK signals, and (2) the signal contains strong DC/low-frequency energy and hence DC offset cancellation is no longer an easy task. In this dissertation, a direct-conversion receiver is designed for high speed 4 FSK <b>radio</b> <b>paging</b> applications. Various design considerations are discussed and analyzed. A zero-crossing based counting/comparing scheme is chosen for the demodulation. The BER is improved by a novel zero-crossing interpolation technique. Following official specifications on <b>radio</b> <b>paging</b> receivers, a high level simulation is carried out to verify the demodulator performance and derive circuit requirements. The self-mixing-related time-varying offset is suppressed by the harmonic mixer to the noise level. A differential peak alignment method is developed to cancel the mismatch-induced static offset. A frame-by-frame scheme is also proposed for further offset reduction. A prototype receiver is fabricated in a 0. 35 micron CMOS process, with all major building blocks included. The front-end consists of a differential LNA and a quadrature harmonic mixer. In the base-band, an AGC circuit provides over 30 dB gain tuning range. The channel selection is done by a 5 th order gyrator filter. The demodulator is formed by a l-level zero-crossing interpolator, clock recovery circuits and decision logics. Main functions of the receiver has been verified...|$|R

The on-body units can be addressed in three ways: all units; a group of units; or an individual unit. All the functions developed were integrated into a single package that can be worn on the user's wrist. The control portion of the on-body unit is implemented by a microcomputer.

This paper focuses on the self-organization of enterprise femtocells, which is certainly more challenging than that of home femtocells. In the context of 3 GPP LTE, we propose solutions to automatically tune parameters such as radio spectrum, pilot power, resource blocks, and access control mechanisms for opti-mal performance via self-organization network (SON). Further-more, <b>on-site</b> <b>radio</b> measurements and system-level simulations are used to benchmark their performance.

50|$|<b>Paging</b> <b>systems</b> are {{operated}} by commercial carriers, {{often as a}} subscription service, and they are also operated directly by end users as private systems. Commercial carrier systems tend to cover a larger geographical area than private systems, while private systems tend to cover their limited area more thoroughly and deliver messages faster than commercial systems. In all systems, clients send messages to pagers, an activity {{commonly referred to as}} <b>paging.</b> <b>System</b> operators often assign unique phone numbers or email addresses to pagers (and pre-defined groups of pagers), enabling clients to page by telephone call, e-mail, and SMS. <b>Paging</b> <b>systems</b> also support various types of direct connection protocols, which sacrifice global addressing and accessibility for a dedicated communications link. Automated monitoring and escalation software clients, often used in hospitals, IT departments, and alarm companies, tend to prefer direct connections because of the increased reliability.
