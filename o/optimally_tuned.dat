In terms of optimal control, it has been postulated that the nervous system can learn to find task-specific variables through an optimal control search strategy. It has been shown that adaptation in a visuomotor reaching task becomes <b>optimally</b> <b>tuned</b> so that the cost of movement trajectories decreases over trials.

40|$|In finite-volume-based flow simulations, {{absorbing}} layers {{are widely}} used to reduce pressure wave reflections at boundaries of the computational domain. A disadvantage of absorbing layers is that they contain case-dependent parameters; thus {{the question is how}} to <b>optimally</b> <b>tune</b> these parameters, so that a desired reduction of reflections can be obtained? As a step towards the answer of these questions, this article presents a theory which predicts reflection coefficients for absorbing layers. The theory is given for 1 D-wave propagation and is then extended to 2 D and 3 D to cover waves of oblique incidence. The theory is validated via flow simulations of regular and irregular pressure waves in air and water, based on Navier-Stokes-type equations and the finite-volume method. Theory predictions and simulation results show good agreement. It is demonstrated how the theory can be used to <b>optimally</b> <b>tune</b> the absorbing layer parameters to minimize undesired wave reflection.

40|$|Dynamic {{vibration}} absorbers and dampers {{are used}} to reduce the vibration responses of mechanical systems. A dynamic vibration absorber reduces vibrations of a primary system over a desired frequency range by absorbing the energy through responding with opposite phase {{to that of the}} force acting on the primary system. A damper, on the other hand, is a device used for reducing the magnitude of a shock or vibration by energy dissipation methods. The latter is extensively used in automotive engines to reduce torsional oscillations and in aircraft landing gears to damp out shimmy oscillations. This thesis aims to study and understand an <b>optimally</b> <b>tuned</b> viscous torsional vibration damper which is a combination of a dynamic vibration absorber and damper. The primary system whose vibration is to be suppressed, along with the <b>optimally</b> <b>tuned</b> viscous torsional vibration damper, will form a two-degree-of-freedom system which will be studied for its dynamic behaviour. The analytical model includes parameters such as primary inertia, damping and stiffness and secondary inertia, damping and stiffness. Numerical determination of optimum damping and stiffness for a secondary system is carried out and simulated results are presented and discussed. Validation of some aspects of the analytical studies is carried out with experimental investigation for the <b>optimally</b> <b>tuned</b> viscous torsional vibration damper and viscous damper. The test results of the two damping devices and the analytical investigations are compared. In addition, the study is extended, applying the <b>optimally</b> <b>tuned</b> viscous torsional vibration damper to a seven-degree-of-freedom torsional system namely to a four-stroke six-in-line cylinder internal combustion engine.
