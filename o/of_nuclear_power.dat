5|$|At this point, McCormack {{had become}} {{apprehensive}} about his career, but in early 1947 {{a new and}} exciting opportunity opened up. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 had created the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to oversee research and development <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> and nuclear weapons. The Act had created a statutory position inside the AEC called the Director of Military Applications, which the AEC commissioners envisaged as a staff post responsible for military planning and policy formulation.

5|$|In 1950, General Nichols became Deputy Director of the Guided Missiles Division of the Department of Defense. He was {{appointed}} chief {{of research and}} development when it was reorganized in 1952. In 1953, he became the general manager of the Atomic Energy Commission, where he promoted the construction <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plants.

In later life, Nichols became an engineering consultant on private nuclear power plants.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{suggests}} that the TMI accident incited widespread criticism <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> technology, the nuclear industry, and the NRC. Critics faulted the industry and the NRC for their poor performance {{both before and after}} the accident. The international attention garnered by the crisis redoubled the determination of, and enhanced the credibility of, the anti-nuclear movement. Arguably, the United States nuclear industry has never recovered.|$|E
50|$|KEPCO's {{involvement}} in the nuclear energy sector ranges from design and engineering <b>of</b> the <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plant to <b>nuclear</b> fuel, commissioning and operation, maintenance and decommissioning.

50|$|The <b>nuclear</b> <b>powered</b> steam {{generator}} {{started as a}} power plant for the first nuclear submarine, the USS Nautilus (SSN-571). It was designed and built by the Westinghouse power company for the submarine from there the company started its development and research <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>powered</b> {{steam generator}}s. Once peaceful nuclear reactors were legalized for use as power plants, power corporations jumped at the opportunity to utilize the growing development <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>powered</b> steam generators. Westinghouse built one <b>of</b> the first <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plants, the Yankee Rowe <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> station (NPS), which also used a <b>nuclear</b> <b>powered</b> steam generator, in 1960. This power plant had a one hundred MWe (mega watt electric) output. By comparison, some modern plants have over 1100 MWe output. Eventually, other international companies such as Babcock & Wilcox and Combustion Engineering began their own programs {{for research and development}} <b>of</b> the <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> steam generator. Since the 1960s, the US has fallen behind on some European nations in embracing this new power source. France and the UK have been more actively pursuing the benefits that come with nuclear energy, while the US is more concerned about the risk. Finally, it seems China is planning a massive increase to their <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> supply and ordering many new plants to be built.|$|R

5|$|After the war, Oppenheimer became {{chairman}} of the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created United States Atomic Energy Commission. He used that position to lobby for international control <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> to avert nuclear proliferation and a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. After provoking the ire of many politicians with his outspoken opinions during the Second Red Scare, he suffered the revocation of his security clearance in a much-publicized hearing in 1954, and was effectively stripped of his direct political influence; he continued to lecture, write and work in physics. Nine years later, President John F. Kennedy awarded (and Lyndon B. Johnson presented) him with the Enrico Fermi Award {{as a gesture of}} political rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|Baxter was {{recruited}} by the then-New South Wales University of Technology {{as a professor of}} chemical engineering in 1949.

He served as chairman of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission from 1957 to 1972 and the International Atomic Energy Agency from 1969 to 1970. He oversaw the construction of the High Flux Australian Reactor (HIFAR) at Lucas Heights. He also founded the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), and, as the chairman of the Sydney Opera House Trust, brought the Sydney Opera House to completion and opening on 20 October 1973.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{legislative}} session, Beshear began to address his agenda related to energy production. In April 2008, {{he announced that}} he would divide the state's Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet to form a new Energy and Environmental Cabinet. The move essentially reversed the consolidation of Environmental, Public Protection, and Labor Cabinets effected under Beshear's predecessor, Ernie Fletcher. Later in the year, Beshear released what he called the state's first-ever comprehensive energy plan. The plan called for expansion of solar, wind, and biomass energy generation, as well as more speculative ventures such as coal gasification and carbon capture and sequestration. Although the plan called for an exploration of the use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power,</b> Beshear stopped short of advocating an end to the state's ban on the construction of nuclear reactors.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, Japan {{adopted a}} new {{constitution}} emphasizing liberal democratic practices. The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952 and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956. Japan later achieved rapid growth to become the second-largest economy in the world, until surpassed by China in 2010. This ended in the mid-1990s when Japan suffered a major recession. In {{the beginning of the}} 21st century, positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery. On March 11, 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history; this triggered the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, one of the worst disasters in the history <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> in the United States {{slowed to a}} halt, as new plants were cancelled or put on hold. The 1983 financial collapse of the Washington Public Power Supply System, a government agency planning to build five large nuclear power plants throughout the state, and the Three Mile Island accident of 1979 both contributed {{to a decline in}} interest in the university's nuclear program. Student use of the reactor was replaced by commercial use to produce nuclear isotopes for medical use. By 1988, the enrollment in UW's nuclear engineering program shrunk to 23 students, and it was cancelled entirely in 1992.|$|E
5|$|In {{these early}} days we {{explored}} {{all sorts of}} power reactors, comparing {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each type. The number of possibilities was enormous, since there are many possibilities for each component of a reactor—fuel, coolant, moderator. The fissile material may be 233U, 235U, or 239Pu; the coolant may be: water, heavy water, gas, or liquid metal; the moderator may be: water, heavy water, beryllium, graphite—or, in a fast- neutron reactor, no moderator. I have calculated that, if one counted all the combinations of fuel, coolant, and moderator, one could identify about a thousand distinct reactors. Thus, at the very beginning <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power,</b> we had to choose which possibilities to pursue, which to ignore.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Alfonsín {{refused to}} foster {{diplomatic}} relations with the Brazilian military government, and only did so when the dictatorship ended and José Sarney became president. One of their initial concerns was to increase Argentine–Brazilian trade. Both presidents met in Foz do Iguaçu and issued a joint declaration about the peaceful use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power.</b> A second meeting in Buenos Aires strengthened the trade agreements. Argentina and Brazil signed the Program of Integration and Economic Cooperation (PICE), and in 1988 both countries and Uruguay agreed to create a common market. This led to the 1991 Treaty of Asunción, that created the Mercosur.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear waste {{policy in}} Germany is in flux. German {{planning}} for a permanent geologic repository began in 1974, focused on salt dome Gorleben, a salt mine near Gorleben about 100 kilometers northeast of Braunschweig. The site was announced in 1977 with plans for a reprocessing plant, spent fuel management, and permanent disposal facilities at a single site. Plans for the reprocessing plant were dropped in 1979. In 2000, {{the federal government and}} utilities agreed to suspend underground investigations for three to ten years, and the government committed to ending its use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power,</b> closing one reactor in 2003.|$|E
