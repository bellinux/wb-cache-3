In a decompression dive, the decompression phase may make up a large part of the time spent underwater (in many cases it is longer than the actual time spent at depth).|$|E
5|$|Free {{oxygen gas}} was almost nonexistent in Earth's {{atmosphere}} before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved, probably about 3.5 billion years ago. Free oxygen {{first appeared in}} significant quantities during the Paleoproterozoic eon (between 3.0 and 2.3 billion years ago). For the first billion years, any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations. When such oxygen sinks became saturated, free oxygen began to <b>outgas</b> from the oceans 3–2.7billion years ago, reaching 10% of its present level around 1.7billion years ago.|$|E
25|$|A {{considerable}} amount of inert gas {{will remain in the}} tissues after a diver has surfaced, even if no symptoms of decompression sickness occur. This residual gas may be dissolved or in sub-clinical bubble form, and will continue to <b>outgas</b> while the diver remains at the surface. If a repetitive dive is made, the tissues are preloaded with this residual gas which will make them saturate faster.|$|E
40|$|The <b>outgassing</b> {{equation}} {{based on}} the Temkin isotherm is presented to consider the <b>outgassing</b> behaviour in the pump-down of an unbaked vacuum system. A method to solve approximartely the equation is discussed first and then solutions of <b>outgassing</b> rates are derived. Discussion is made how to derive appropriate solutions from the equation which are possible to predict the dependence of <b>outgassing</b> rate on pumping time and pumping speed.

50|$|Ultra-high vacuum {{systems are}} usually baked, preferably under vacuum, to {{temporarily}} raise the vapour pressure of all <b>outgassing</b> materials and boil them off. Once {{the bulk of}} the <b>outgassing</b> materials are boiled off and evacuated, the system may be cooled to lower vapour pressures and minimize residual <b>outgassing</b> during actual operation. Some systems are cooled well below room temperature by liquid nitrogen to shut down residual <b>outgassing</b> and simultaneously cryopump the system.|$|R
25|$|At {{temperatures}} above 550°C {{the equilibrium}} CO2 pressure begins {{to exceed the}} CO2 pressure in air. So above 550°C, calcium carbonate begins to <b>outgas</b> CO2 into air. However, in a charcoal fired kiln, the concentration of CO2 will be much higher {{than it is in}} air. Indeed, if all the oxygen in the kiln is consumed in the fire, then the partial pressure of CO2 in the kiln can be as high as 20 kPa.|$|E
25|$|When wire {{insulation}} disintegrates, it {{can result in}} an unintended electrical contact at a different location from the desired sensing point. If such a damaged thermocouple {{is used in the}} closed loop control of a thermostat or other temperature controller, this can lead to a runaway overheating event and possibly severe damage, as the false temperature reading will typically be lower than the sensing junction temperature. Failed insulation will also typically <b>outgas,</b> which can lead to process contamination. For parts of thermocouples used at very high temperatures or in contamination-sensitive applications, the only suitable insulation may be vacuum or inert gas; the mechanical rigidity of the thermocouple wires is used to keep them separated.|$|E
500|$|... {{underwater}} diving before flying– divers who {{ascend to}} altitude soon after a dive increase {{their risk of}} developing DCS even if the dive itself was within the dive table safe limits. Dive tables make provisions for post-dive time at surface level before flying to allow any residual excess nitrogen to <b>outgas.</b> However, the pressure maintained inside even a pressurized aircraft may be as low as the pressure equivalent to an altitude of [...] above sea level. Therefore, {{the assumption that the}} dive table surface interval occurs at normal atmospheric pressure is invalidated by flying during that surface interval, and an otherwise-safe dive may then exceed the dive table limits.|$|E

40|$|Volcanic <b>outgassing</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{volatiles}} for the martian atmosphere and degassing of the martian interior potentially influenced the early martian climate. Using a parameterized thermo-chemical evolution model and considering two end-member melting models, we self-consistently calculate the amount of CO 2 and H 2 O <b>outgassed</b> during the martian evolution. <b>Outgassing</b> rates are found to depend primarily on a factor describing the <b>outgassing</b> efficiency, the bulk mantle water content, the mantle oxygen fugacity, and the local melt fraction in the magma source regions. We find that significant <b>outgassing</b> ceased around 3. 5 – 2 Gyr ago, depending on the adopted melting model. A total of 0. 9 – 1 bar CO 2 is <b>outgassed</b> during this time period if a mantle oxygen fugacity corresponding to one log 10 unit above the iron–wustite buffer is assumed. Additionally, a total of 17 – 61 m of water is delivered to the surface. <b>Outgassing</b> is most efficient in the pre-Noachian (up to 4. 1 Gyr), but still significant during the Noachian, and 5 – 15 m of water and ∼ 250 mbar of CO 2 are <b>outgassed</b> between 4. 1 and 3. 7 Gyr. Although this amount is probably insufficient for an appreciable greenhouse effect, pressures are found to be sufficient to stabilize transient liquid water on the surface well into the Hesperian period. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis that rather than being warm-and-wet, the martian climate was probably cold-and-wet. <b>Outgassing</b> is found to strongly decline during the Hesperian, and is insignificant during the Amazonian period. A simple parameterization for the <b>outgassing</b> of CO 2 and H 2 O as a function of time is presented...|$|R
50|$|Evaporation and {{sublimation}} into {{a vacuum}} is called <b>outgassing.</b> All materials, solid or liquid, {{have a small}} vapour pressure, and their <b>outgassing</b> becomes important when the vacuum pressure falls below this vapour pressure. <b>Outgassing</b> has the same effect as a leak and can limit the achievable vacuum. <b>Outgassing</b> products may condense on nearby colder surfaces, which can be troublesome if they obscure optical instruments or react with other materials.

2500|$|Scott Farrar {{returned}} as visual effects supervisor and anticipated moodier use of lighting {{as well as}} deeper roles for the Decepticons. He stated that with the bigger deadline, post-production would become a [...] "circus". The producers expected that with a bigger budget and the special effects worked out, the Transformers would have a larger role. Peter Cullen recalled, [...] "Don Murphy mentioned to me, 'Only because of the tremendous expense to animate Optimus Prime, he'll be in just {{a certain amount of}} [...]' But he said, 'Next time, if the movie is a success, you're gonna be in it a ton.'" [...] Michael Bay hoped to include more close-ups of the robots' faces. The heads had to be designed with more pieces in order to express emotions in a more convincing way. Farrar said the animators implemented more [...] "splashes and the hits and the fighting on dirt or moving, banging into trees, [...] things splinter and break, [...] spit, they <b>outgas,</b> they sweat, they snort." [...] Shooting in the higher resolution of IMAX required up to 72 hours to render a single frame of animation. While ILM used 15 terabytes for Transformers, they used 140 for the sequel. Particularly problematic effects were the lighting, with scenes such as Jetfire inside the Smithsonian requiring 41 light sources, and the destruction of the pyramid, which appears in about five shots and required seven months to simulate the behavior of the blocks. Orci hinted the majority of the Decepticons were entirely computer-generated in both robot and alternate modes, making it easier to write additional scenes for them in post-production. Rendering the Devastator took over 85% of ILM's render farm capacity, and the complexity of the scene and having to render it at IMAX resolution caused one computer to [...] "explode".|$|E

We studied on these five commonly used silicone polymers: CV 2568, RTV 566, DC 93 - 500, SCV 2590 and SCV 2590 - 2. ^ Raman spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were applied to study their compositions; while their <b>outgassing</b> products and <b>outgassing</b> rates were determined by FTIR. ^ Secondly, films formed from pure Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), Tetra-n-propylsilicate (NPS), and their mixtures with various volume ratios were studied via Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), profilometry, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and ellipsometry to determine the <b>outgassing</b> products properties. The effects of VUV input power, deposition time and cell temperature on the films formation and their optical properties were studied and discussed in detail. ^ Finally, the experimental data of films formed from PDMS, NPS and their mixtures with one factor varying were modeled together to determine how they change the optical property of each material in both visible to NIR and IR wavelength ranges. ^ The thickness and optical constants data of <b>outgassing</b> products in this dissertation are valuable for system performance evaluation and lifetime prediction, and they {{could also be used}} as the guideline for choosing low <b>outgassing</b> silicone polymer, optimizing the compositions and ratios of compositions in low <b>outgassing</b> silicone polymers. ...|$|R
