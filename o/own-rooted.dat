We compared the exo- and endochitinase activities of leaves and roots from non-trans-genic Pinova and the transgenic lines T 386 and T 389. Local and systemic effects were examined using <b>own-rooted</b> trees and trees grafted onto rootstock M 9. Scab susceptibility was also assessed in <b>own-rooted</b> and grafted trees. AMF root colonization was assessed microscopically in the roots of apple trees cultivated in pots with artificial sub-strate and inoculated with the AMF Glomus intraradices and Glomus mosseae. <b>Own-rooted</b> transgenic lines had sig-nificantly higher chitinase activities in their leaves and roots compared to non-transgenic Pinova. Both of the <b>own-rooted</b> transgenic lines showed significantly fewer symptoms of scab infection as well as significantly lower root colonization by AMF. Biomass production was significantly reduced in both <b>own-rooted</b> transgenic lines. Rootstock M 9 influenced chitinase activities in the leaves of grafted scions. When grafted onto M 9, the leaf chitinase activities of non-transgenic Pinova (M 9 /Pinova) and transgenic lines (M 9 /T 386 and M 9 /T 389) were not as different as when grown on their own roots.

40|$|The {{influence}} of root system and genotype on vegetative and reproductive growth was characterized on untrained apple (Malus domestica) genotypes that were <b>own-rooted</b> or grafted onto M. 9 rootstock. The eight genotypes assessed were selected at INRA for resistance to scab (Venturia inaequalis) and low susceptibility to mildew (Podosphera leucotricha), good fruit quality and aptitude to storage, {{and depending on}} genotype, other traits such as regular bearing and one fruit per inflorescence. The two main objectives were to determine the {{influence of}} (1) the scion genotype, and (2) the root system genotype on tree growth and yield. Trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA), branch cross-sectional area (BCSA) and position of branches with a basal diameter of more than one centimeter were measured {{at the end of the}} third year of growth in the orchard. Yield and fruit size data were collected during the first four years of tree growth. Different genotypes had different TCSA and total BCSA but all had a smaller TCSA and total BCSA when grown on M. 9 compared with <b>own-rooted</b> trees. The relationship between TCSA and total BCSA was also different depending on genotype but remained unaffected by root system. The relative location of BCSA, or basitony of the trunk, was influenced by the type of root system. <b>Own-rooted</b> trees were more basitonic than trees on M. 9. Yield, precocity and fruit size differences were attributed to both genotype and root system. In all genotypes, yield efficiency (kg of fruit/cm 2 TCSA) was higher with M. 9. This may not be the defining characteristic since some genotypes expressed similar or even higher yields and fruit size in the 3 rd and/or 4 th year when <b>own-rooted.</b> Precocious <b>own-rooted</b> trees, which in our study belong to type IV architectural class (acrotonic), may be more interesting in the long-term because, although they have later entrance into production, they may have higher cumulative yields as early as the 4 th year, and a better distribution of fruit within the canopy.

"Thesis supervisor: Dr. Michele Warmund. Norton is an {{important}} commercial grape cultivar commonly grown in Missouri and the surrounding region because of its wine quality and disease resistance. However, <b>own-rooted</b> Norton vines typically produce fruit with high pH, malic acid, and potassium, which are known to reduce quality, aging potential, and stability of wine. Additionally, <b>own-rooted</b> Norton vines often produce excessive vegetative growth. Thus, effects of selected rootstocks on Norton fruit composition, yield, and vegetative growth were studied in Phelps County, MO within a commercial vineyard during 2010 and 2011. Rootstocks included 3309 C, 101 - 14, Schwarzmann, 5 BB, SO 4, 1103 P, 110 R, 140 Ru, 1616 C, and 44 - 53 M. <b>Own-rooted</b> Norton vines were also included as a control. Rootstocks did not affect vegetative growth or fruit characteristics (organic acids, glucose, or fructose). However, Norton petiole contents of Ca and P were deficient on some rootstocks in 2010 and 2011. Vines on 101 - 14, 110 R, and 1616 C rootstocks produced greater fruit yield than <b>own-rooted</b> vines.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Molybdenum deficiency(Mo-deficiency) {{has been}} {{suggested}} to {{be the cause of}} poor yield of <b>own-rooted</b> Merlot vines in Australia. The aims of these experiments were to quantify the effect of foliar molybdenum treatment (Mo-treatment) on vine molybdenum status and to identify which components of yield are affected by Mo-treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: Experiments were conducted on <b>own-rooted</b> Vitis vinifera cv. Merlot in South Australia in 2003 – 07. Vines were sprayed with two rates of sodium molybdate (0, 0. 101 and 0. 202 g/vine) in the spring. Vine molybdenum status was assessed at flowering and juice molybdenum concentration was measured at harvest. The effects of Mo-treatment on vine growth and yield were also measured. Mo-treatment significantly increased yield of molybdenum deficient vines, a function of improved fruitset. Mo-treatment significantly increased the concentration of molybdenum in the petioles, shoot tips and inflorescences compared with the controls. Budburst was delayed on molybdenum-treated vines in the spring following Mo-treatment. The concentration of molybdenum in grape juice only increased in vines that had sufficient molybdenum. CONCLUSIONS: Mo-treatment increased vine molybdenum status; however, yield only increased on Mo-deficient vines. The increase in yield was a function of improved fruitset.

The susceptibility of the two non-edible Macadamia species (Macadamia ternifolia and Macadamia jansenii) to P. cinnamomi is not well-understood. Commercial macadamia trees are established on grafted seedling (seed propagation) or <b>own-rooted</b> cutting (vegetative propagation) rootstocks of hybrids of the cultivated species. There is little information to support the preferential use of rootstock propagated by either seedling or <b>own-rooted</b> cutting methods in macadamia. In this study we assessed roots of macadamia plants of the four species and their hybrids, derived from the two methods of propagation, for their susceptibility to P. cinnamomi infection. The roots of inoculated plant from which P. cinnamomi was recovered showed blackening symptoms. The non-cultivated species, M. ternifolia and M. jansenii and their hybrids were the most susceptible germplasm compared with M. tetraphylla and M. integrifolia. Of these two species, M. tetraphylla was less susceptible than M. integrifolia. Significant differences were observed among the accessions of their hybrids.

40|$|Among the {{challenges}} facing the Texas winegrape industry is Phymatotrichopsis omnivora, the cotton root rot (CRR) pathogen. A survey instrument was created and distributed to grape growers which revealed that the disease {{is a serious problem}} in counties where acreage of new vineyards is on the increase. Grape growers expressed significant concern because there were no effective recommendations for disease control. One control option for growers is the use of promising rootstock x scion combinations. In 2012, a root stock field trial was planted with two <b>own-rooted</b> grape varieties (Chardonnay, Merlot) and the same two varieties on Dog Ridge root stock. Both varieties on the root stock showed a significant statistical difference in disease development when compared to <b>own-rooted</b> vines. Merlot <b>own-rooted</b> vines were more resistant than the Chardonnay <b>own-rooted</b> vines. Two experimental fungicide field trials were initiated in vineyards in the spring of 2012. In one vineyard, several fungicides were tested including flutriafol, a fungicide being used successfully to control CRR on cotton. In the commercial vineyard in Travis County, TX, flutriafol was applied at 0. 26 lbs/a. i. /acre (1 X), 2. 6 lbs/a. i. /acre (10 X), and 5. 2 lbs/a. i. /acre (20 X) through a manually applied soil drench. There was a significantly lower level of disease development in the 10 X plots, as compared to untreated controls. Vines treated with a 10 X rate of flutriafol also showed decreased incidence of non-target foliar pathogens and possible plant health effects when compared to the other treatments. In 2014, two new field trials were established using chemigation at an established vineyard and a newly planted vineyard. The experimental block at the newly planted vineyard consisted of 30 rows of Petite Syrah on 5 BB rootstock containing 118 vines/row. Two rates of flutriafol at 0. 26 lbs/a. i. /acre (1 X) and 0. 52 lbs/a. i. /acre (2 X) were applied through the irrigation system with 10 plots (rows) /treatment. In the untreated plots, disease increased from 0 - 5. 5 % over a 12 week period following treatments. No disease was observed until week 11 in any of the treated plots. However, by week 12, disease incidence had increased to 2. 5 % and 1. 4 % in the 1 X and 2 X plots, respectively.

40|$|Five {{salinity}} treatments, ranging between 0. 37 and 3. 47 dS m- 1, {{were applied}} through a trickle irrigation system to <b>own-rooted</b> sultana grapevines for six years. The changes in soil salinity levels {{and the relationship}} between soil salinity and yield were studied, and a simplified salt balance model was developed to calculate leaching fractions. Soil salinity was strongly influenced by soil texture as well as by salt treatment, because leaching fractions were lower in heavier soils; they averaged 23 % in the lightest soils and 10 % in the heaviest. Leaching fractions also increased with salt treatment, from 7 % in the 0. 37 dS m- 1 treatment to 24 % in the 3. 47 dS m- 1 treatment. This was probably because water use by salinized vines was lower. Yield was correlated with mean soil salinity, ECe, but the relationship was not as good as with plant salinity levels. The fitted model accounted for between 52 and 62 % of the variance. It was concluded that soil salinity levels at the end of winter should be maintained below 1. 0 dS m- 1 in order to keep yield losses below 10 %. For <b>own-rooted</b> sultana grapevines in Sunraysia, this requires a leaching fraction of about 8 %. Rootzone depth and root density were lower in the heavier soils, and were decreased by salt treatment. The deleterious effects of salt treatment on clay dispersion and soil hydraulic conductivity were also greater in the heavier soils.

Trials in the Sunraysia region have shown that moderate to high salinities (1. 75 - 3. 5 dS/m) over four seasons reduced yield of <b>own-rooted</b> grapevines (cv. Sultana) whereas vines grafted to salt tolerant rootstocks e. g. Ramsey experienced no yield reduction. Rootstocks such as Ramsey, 1103 Paulsen, 140 Ruggeri and 101 - 14 resulted in lower concentrations of chloride (Cl –) in Shiraz grape juice relative to <b>own-rooted</b> vines but some rootstocks e. g. K 51 - 40, resulted in high grape juice and wine Cl– and sodium (Na+) concentrations when irrigated with water having a salinity of 2. 1 dS/m. There is evidence that the Cl– exclusion ability of Ramsey and 1103 Paulsen decreases over several seasons of irrigation with 2. 1 dS/m, whereas that of Ruggeri 140 is maintained. Comparison of Shiraz wine from vines on K 51 - 40 rootstock, showing salt damage (“leaf burn”), with wine from vines on Ruggeri 140 rootstock with no visible “leaf burn”, showed no difference in wine colour density, total phenolics, total and ionised anthocyanins. Sensory assessments revealed statistically significant and substantial differences among the wines made from six rootstocks in “salty” ratings which correlates (r > 0. 94) with the Na+, Cl– and potassium (K+) concentrations of the wines.

To {{better understand the}} effect of rootstock-scion interaction in a cool climate region, an experimental vineyard was planted in 1997 at the Oregon State University Woodhall III property in the southern Willamette Valley. The first experiment consists of Pinot noir (clone FPMS 2 A) grafted to 19 rootstocks and an <b>own-rooted</b> control. Two years of growth responses and one year's harvest data were analyzed. Rootstocks affected shoot length and shoot diameter, leaf gas exchange rates, leaf chlorophyll contents, cluster size and yield components, soluble solids, pH and titratable acidity. Treatments with long, thick shoots and heavy pruning weights tended to have high chlorophyll contents, with two exceptions. The Pinot noir <b>own-rooted</b> control and Riparia Gloire-Pinot noir vines had elevated chlorophyll levels but shorter shoots and had smaller shoot diameters. Pinot noir grafted to 1103 Paulsen, 99 Richter, 110 Richter and 140 Ruggeri set fewer berries per cluster. 1103 Paulsen, 99 Richter, 110 Richter rootstocks effected scion fruitfulness by lowering cluster weights. 125 AA Kober and 1103 Paulsen had the lowest levels of soluble solids but the highest pruning weights, indicating a lack of fruit-to-canopy balance. Establishment rate was highest for ungrafted Pinot noir vines and Pinot noir on 3309 Couderc, 4453 Malegue, 8 B Teleki, Selection Oppenheim 4, 161 - 49 Couderc, and 420 A Millardet et de Grasset and the slowest for 110 Richter, 99 Richter, and 1103 Paulsen.

Fe deficiency or excess generally led to higher concentrations of titratable acidity and skin/berry ratio, and to lower reducing sugar content, sugar/acid ratio, pH, berry weight, and concentration of anthocyanins.

Pruning weight, cane weight, and cane number were all reduced as a consequence of zero irrigation. Yields were reduced in unirrigated treatments due to a reduction in cluster number, cluster weight, and berry weight rather than fruit set or berry number. Unirrigated Ramsey was the only rootstock able to maintain yield comparable with irrigated rootstocks. Unirrigated own roots performed well in the first season but not {{in the second and third}} seasons when water stress had a negative effect on yield. Millerandage, coulure, and seedless berry numbers were the main reproductive parameters found to have a negative impact on yield and both <b>own-rooted</b> and grafted vines were as susceptible to these parameters. Season had a greater influence than either rootstock type or irrigation. These findings have significant implications for regions facing future drought and declining water supplies...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] study was conducted {{as part of a}} larger investigation into the effect of management practices on selected sown cover crops and the effects thereof on grapevine performance. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of these cover crops on plant parasitic nematode populations under natural field conditions. The trial site was in an <b>own-rooted</b> Sultanina vineyard situated in the Lower Orange River of the Northern Cape Province. Three management practices were applied selectively to ten cover crop species, with two control treatments consisting of weeds. Nematodes were monitored for a period of four years. 'Saia' oats were indicated as being poor hosts to both root-knot and root-lesion nematodes, while 'Overberg' oats showed poor host status against ring nematodes. 'Midmar' ryegrass and 'Paraggio' medic were also poor hosts for root-knot nematodes, while grazing vetch appeared to be a good host for root-knot nematodes. The most notable result from this study was the relatively high numbers of all three nematodes on the vine row, as opposed to the inter-row where cover crops were established. This indicates that vines were much better hosts for these nematodes than the cover crops. It is recommended that if more definite trends are to be observed, Brassica species, which have direct toxic/repellant effects on nematodes, should be tested. Publishers' versio...|$|E
40|$|Rootstock has {{profound}} {{effects on}} traits such as yield and tree size in various horticultural industries, however relatively {{little is known}} about rootstock effects for macadamia. In this study, 12 cultivars were propagated as open-pollinated seedling and clonal rootstocks, and <b>own-rooted</b> cuttings. The same cultivars were also used as scions, and grafted to a subset of rootstocks, then planted at four trial locations. In this preliminary analysis, rootstock accounted for 19 % of the variance in yield compared with 72 % for scion, and 23 % in height compared with 72 % for scion. There was no interaction between rootstock and scion for yield, and only a small effect for height. The interaction between rootstock and propagation method (seedling, clonal, own roots) was not significant for height. A small effect was observed for yield, with the own roots treatment producing significantly lower yield than grafted trees for all rootstock cultivars except 'HAES 849 '. 'H 2 ' seedling rootstock produced a cumulative yield to age 10 years of 11. 1 kg tree - 1 compared to the highest yield of 13. 6 kg tree - 1 for 'Beaumont' clonal rootstocks.

40|$|Chile is the world’s leading {{producer}} of ‘Carménère’ (Vitis vinifera L.), {{which in turn}} is an important variety in Chile, where vineyards are typically grown under irrigated conditions and a large percentage are located in valleys with similar water table levels to those of the study area. Different irrigation management strategies have been used to improve wine quality, such as water stress and deficit irrigations, but the presence of a water table has not been considered in extant literature. This study analyzes the effects of the irrigation regime on grape yield and wine quality when a shallow water table is located between 1. 5 to 2. 2 m depth during the irrigation season. Five applied water treatments: 0 %, 20 %, 40 %, 75 %, and 100 % of estimated vineyard evapotranspiration (ETc) were applied in an <b>own-rooted</b> ‘Carménère’ vineyard located in the Peumo Valley (Chile) during three consecutive seasons (2004 - 2005 to 2006 - 2007). Applying 1400 to 9400 m 3 ha- 1 per season (100 % ETc) had no substantial effect on the measured quality parameters, although grape production in the treatment without irrigation (0 % ETc) was significantly reduced. Applying water at 20 % to 40 % ETc produced high yield (13 to 16 t ha- 1), double the historical mean production, and high quality wine with the presence of a water table close {{to the bottom of the}} root zone...|$|E

Two cultivars of Olea europaea L. ‘Carolea’ and ‘Nocellara Etnea’, were planted in 1997 at two-row spacings: 6 m 3 m and 6 m 6 m. Percentage of flower bud differentiation, fruit weight, yield, pruning material and trunk diameter were measured on each plant of the experimental plot. Plants came into flowering the second year after planting with significant differences between cultivars. Micro-propagated ‘Nocellara Etnea’ plants came into bearing {{as early as the}} second year, whereas grafted plants had no bearing. Eight years after planting, cumulated yield of ‘Nocellara Etnea’ plants was almost double as compared to the ‘Carolea’ plants. Yield from micro-propagated plants was slightly higher with respect to grafted plants in ‘Nocellara Etnea’, but fruit weight was significantly lower. Micro-propagated ‘Carolea’ plants have shown a similar percentage of flower buds but a very low cumulated yield in the period of the trial, due to poor fruit set. In general, vegetative growth was significantly higher on plants with lower crop level. Our results have shown that micro-propagated plants did not exhibit any juvenile trait as, for instance, delay in flowering. In vitro propagation can thus be a rapid and a powerful olive propagation technique. Further investigations are however necessary to check if the main phenological differences observed (average fruit weight and poor fruit set) are somehow due to genetic modifications induced by in vitro propagation...|$|E
40|$|Background and AimsNitrate {{is a major}} form of {{inorganic}} nitrogen {{present in}} cultivated soils; however, information on the mechanisms responsible for uptake of the anion in grapevines is scarce. Methods and ResultsThe response to external nitrate was studied in two clones of the cultivars Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. Grapevines, <b>own-rooted</b> or grafted on the two rootstocks SO 4 and K 5 BB, were grown in nutrient solution and, {{after a period of}} nitrogen (N) -deprivation, exposed to 0. 2 or 1 mmol/L nitrate. The uptake was an inducible process, operated by high- and low-affinity transport systems. The magnitude and time dependence of the induction varied {{as a function of the}} clone. Uptake rate as a function of nitrate external concentration showed a multiphasic pattern. Although nitrate exposure caused a transient up-regulation of nitrate influx transporter genes, a clear correlation with the rise in nitrate uptake could not be found; in contrast, a negative relationship between changes in uptake rates and expression of a nitrate efflux transporter gene was observed. ConclusionsIn the grapevine, the response of low- and high-affinity transport systems to external nitrate was favoured by the presence of the rootstock and also dependent on the characteristics of the scion. Low-affinity uptake and efflux from root cells conceivably play an important role in the overall N-nitrate acquisition. Significance of the StudyThis study shows that activation of mechanisms involved in nitrate uptake in the grapevine is strongly affected by the scion-rootstock combination. Results may be significant for developing agronomic practices and selection programmes related to nitrogen use in the grapevine...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Deficit {{irrigation}} {{techniques have}} been used to improve water use efficiency and control vigour in grapevines, but the consequences of using saline water with these techniques have been little investigated. Here, we investigate the effect of deficit irrigation with moderately saline water on within-vine ion allocation. Methods and Results: Drip-irrigated <b>own-rooted</b> Shiraz and Grenache vines grown in pots were subjected to control, reduced control and partial root-zone drying (both approximately 50 % less than control) irrigation treatments utilising moderately saline irrigation (mean of 2. 46 [*]dS/m) over two seasons. Plant water status and stomatal conductance were measured during the growing seasons, {{and at the end of}} the second season, the vines were destructively sampled to determine plant growth and concentration of ions of various vine structures. When compared against the control, partial root-zone drying had a higher total concentration of Cl−, Na+, K+ and Ca++ present on a whole vine basis. Although Cl− concentration was elevated in leaves for the partial root-zone drying treatment, it was partitioned away from leaves on a total content basis relative to both control and reduced control treatments. The partial root-zone drying treatment also resulted in significantly lower midday leaf water potential. Conclusion: Ion partitioning within grapevines depends on the type of deficit applied. Significance of the Study: Utilising deficit irrigation techniques in combination with saline irrigation water will alter the allocation of ions within a grapevine highlighting the importance of monitoring during the growing season for both fruit composition and long-term vine health.

40|$|Grapevine leafroll disease (GLD) is an {{economically}} important virus disease affecting wine grapes (Vitis vinifera L.), but {{little is known}} about its effect on wine chemistry and sensory composition of wines. In this study, impacts of GLD on fruit yield, berry quality and wine chemistry and sensory features were investigated in a red wine grape cultivar planted in a commercial vineyard. <b>Own-rooted</b> Merlot vines showing GLD symptoms and tested positive for Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 and adjacent non-symptomatic vines that tested negative for the virus were compared during three consecutive seasons. Number and total weight of clusters per vine were significantly less in symptomatic relative to non-symptomatic vines. In contrast to previous studies, a time-course analysis of juice from grapes harvested at different stages of berry development from symptomatic and non-symptomatic vines indicated more prominent negative impacts of GLD on total soluble solids (TSS) and berry skin anthocyanins than in juice pH and titratable acidity. Differences in TSS between grapes of symptomatic and non-symptomatic vines were more pronounced after the onset of véraison, with significantly lower concentrations of TSS in grapes from symptomatic vines throughout berry ripening until harvest. Wines made from grapes of GLD-affected vines had significantly lower alcohol, polymeric pigments, and anthocyanins compared to corresponding wines from grapes of non-symptomatic vines. Sensory descriptive analysis of 2010 wines indicated significant differences in color, aroma and astringency between wines made from grapes harvested from GLD-affected and unaffected vines. The impacts of GLD on yield and fruit and wine quality traits were variable between the seasons, with greater impacts observed during a cooler season, suggesting the influence of host plant × environment interactions on overall impacts of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Within {{a climate}} change scenario, {{increases}} in air temperature are projected, which may negatively impact grape ripening and must composition. In this regard, varietal and genetic diversity may be exploited to maintain grape and wine quality under future warm conditions. The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate the effect of elevated temperature on fruit yield and grape quality of six Tempranillo grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) clones. Tempranillo selections 260, 1048, 1089, 8, 280 and 843 were grown as <b>own-rooted</b> fruit-bearing cuttings under greenhouse conditions. Two temperature regimes (24 ºC/ 14 ºC or 28 ºC/ 18 ºC, day/night) were applied from fruit set to maturity. Fruit yield, and technologic and phenolic maturity parameters were determined at ripeness. In general, elevated temperature did not affect grape yield, and it only reduced bunch weight in plants of clone 1089, which was the least productive under elevated temperature conditions. Regarding grape quality, clones 8, 260 and 843 were the most affected by elevated temperature, with decreases in malic acid, phenolic richness and anthocyanin concentration, as well as increases in tartaric acid and must tonality. By contrast, clones 280 and 1089 were the least affected by temperature, and the concentration of malic and tartaric acid, phenolic richness, potential anthocyanins and anthocyanin extractability in plants grown at 28 ºC/ 18 ºC were similar to those of plants grown at 24 ºC/ 14 ºC. Results suggest that Tempranillo clones 280 and 1089 may be considered in a future climate change scenario to preserve the effects of global warming, thus maintaining a high level of grape quality.

40|$|The area {{affected}} by salinity in Australian grape production regions is increasing, predominantly due to reliance {{in some regions}} on poorer quality water for irrigation and to changes in rainfall patterns resulting in reduced leaching of soil borne salts. Combined with an increased requirement to improve water use efficiency the implementation of deficit irrigation techniques has become common practice. The aim {{of this research was}} to assess the effect of saline irrigation water and deficit irrigation techniques on the performance of <b>own-rooted</b> grapevines as well as test the hypothesis that PRD reduces the salt transport to the shoot. A field experiment was established in Padthaway on <b>own-rooted</b> Shiraz vines in seasons 2009 - 2011. Three irrigation treatments were applied using moderately saline irrigation water (2. 3 dS/m) : control (1. 0 - 2. 3 ML/ha), reduced control (RC) and partial rootzone drying (PRD) (both approximately 50 % of control). This study found that grape juice Cl⁻ and Na⁺ concentrations were not affected significantly by irrigation treatment. Seasonal variation in rainfall and total irrigation applied had a greater effect on altering grape juice Cl⁻ and Na⁺ concentrations than the application of irrigation water with the same moderate salinity but with the different irrigation treatments. A pot trial was established to replicate the treatments mentioned above in conjunction with slightly increased saline irrigation water (2. 46 dS/m) from the field trial for the 2011 - 2012. At {{the end of the second}} year the vines were destructively harvested and growth and ion concentrations for different vine organs assessed. PRD was found to have higher concentrations of Cl⁻, Na⁺, K⁺ and Ca⁺⁺ present on a whole vine basis. Although Cl concentration was elevated in leaves for PRD, it was partitioned away from the leaves on a total content basis relative to both control and RC. This research highlighted that ion partitioning within grapevines will depend on the type of deficit applied and that the higher total root dry weights observed in the PRD treatment could possibly be responsible for the higher whole plant concentrations of Cl⁻, Na⁺, K⁺ and Ca⁺⁺ that were observed. To gain a better understanding of the role Abscisic acid (ABA) plays in modulating the effect of salinity a glasshouse study was undertaken in 2012 - 2014. The aim was to evaluate the effect of exogenously applied ABA to grapevine root systems, with or without saline irrigation water, on water relations, ion allocation, root hydraulic conductance normalized to root dry weight (Lₒ) and aquaporin expression. Exogenously applied ABA was found to increase Lₒ and decrease water use in ABA-only treatments, while in the presence of excess Cl⁻ salts, it also reduced Cl⁻ transport to the shoot. This reduction could not be accounted for by reduced transpiration. Strong positive correlations were observed between Lₒ and E and Lₒ and gs [s subscript] with a slope of the relationships increasing with both ABA and salt treatments. Aquaporin gene expression was not significantly different between treatments an interesting finding that warrants further investigation. However in a linear combination with leaf water potential, the expression of one aquaporin gene VvPIP 2; 3, could explain more than 50 % of the variation in Lₒ independent of the salt and ABA treatments. The expression of the tonoplast aquaporin VvTIP 1; 1 was also correlated to the expression of Vv PIP 2; 1. This study has led to a greater understanding of the implications for growers when irrigating with moderately saline irrigation water in conjunction with some form of deficit irrigation technique. Although the initial hypothesis was negated in both the field and pot trial with Cl⁻ concentrations in the shoot remaining similar to the control, the glasshouse study proved that ABA has the ability to reduce salt transport to the shoots independently of its effects on stomatal conductance and root water transport. Further research to probe the mechanism of the effect of ABA on Cl⁻ transport will require the membrane transporters responsible for Cl⁻ transport to be identified and their possible transcriptional and post-translational control by ABA determined.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundGrapevine phylloxera, {{an insect}} related to true aphids, {{is a major}} {{historic}} pest of viticulture only controlled through the selection of resistant rootstocks or through quarantine regulations where grapevine is cultivated <b>own-rooted.</b> Transcriptomic data could help understand the bases of its original life-traits, including a striking case of polyphenism, with forms feeding on roots and forms feeding in leaf-galls. Comparisons with true aphids (for which complete genomes have been sequenced) should also allow to link differences in life-traits {{of the two groups}} with changes in gene repertoires or shifts in patterns of expression. ResultsWe sequenced transcriptomes of the grapevine phylloxera (Illumina technology), choosing three life-stages (adults on roots or on leaf galls, and eggs) to cover a large catalogue of transcripts, and performed a de novo assembly. This resulted in 105, 697 contigs, which were annotated: most contigs had a best blastx hit to the pea aphid (phylogenetically closest complete genome), while very few bacterial hits were recorded (except for Probionibacterium acnes). Coding sequences were predicted from this data set (17, 372 sequences), revealing an extremely high AT-bias (at the third codon position). Differential expression (DE) analysis among root-feeding and gall-feeding showed that i) the root-feeding form displayed a much larger number of differentially expressed transcripts ii) root-feeding biased genes were enriched in some categories, for example cuticular proteins and genes associated with cell-cell signaling iii) leaf-galling-biased genes were enriched in genes associated with the nucleus and DNA-replication, suggesting a metabolism more oriented towards fast and active multiplication. We also identified a gene family with a very high expression level (copies totaling nearly 10  % of the reads) in the grapevine phylloxera (both in root and leaf galling forms), but usually expressed at very low levels in true aphids (except in sexual oviparous females). These transcripts thus appear to be associated with oviparity. ConclusionsOur study illustrated major intraspecific changes in transcriptome profiles, related with different life-styles (and the feeding on roots versus in leaf-galls). At a different scale, we could also illustrate one major shift in expression levels associated with changes in life-traits that occurred along evolution and that respectively characterize (strictly oviparous) grapevine phylloxera and (mostly viviparous) true aphids...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Although {{the effects}} of P {{deficiency}} on tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) growth, P uptake and utilization as well as leaf gas exchange and Chl a fluorescence have been investigated, very {{little is known about}} {{the effects of}} P deficiency on photosynthetic electron transport, photosynthetic enzymes and carbohydrates of tea leaves. In this study, <b>own-rooted</b> 10 -month-old tea trees were supplied three times weekly for 17 weeks with 500 mL of nutrient solution at a P concentration of 0, 40, 80, 160, 400 or 1000 μM. This objective of this study was to determine how P deficiency affects CO 2 assimilation, Rubisco, carbohydrates and photosynthetic electron transport in tea leaves to understand the mechanism by which P deficiency leads to a decrease in CO 2 assimilation. Results Both root and shoot dry weight increased as P supply increased from 0 to 160 μM, then remained unchanged. P-deficient leaves from 0 to 80 μM P-treated trees showed decreased CO 2 assimilation and stomatal conductance, but increased intercellular CO 2 concentration. Both initial and total Rubisco activity, contents of Chl and total soluble protein in P-deficient leaves decreased to a lesser extent than CO 2 assimilation. Contents of sucrose and starch were decreased in P-deficient leaves, whereas contents of glucose and fructose did not change significantly except for a significant increase in the lowest P leaves. OJIP transients from P-deficient leaves displayed a rise at the O-step and a depression at the P-step, accompanied by two new steps at about 150 μs (L-step) and at about 300 μs (K-step). RC/CS o, TR o /ABS (or F v /F m), ET o /ABS, RE o /ABS, maximum amplitude of IP phase, PI abs and PI tot, abs were decreased in P-deficient leaves, while V J, V I and dissipated energy were increased. Conclusion P deficiency decreased photosynthetic electron transport capacity by impairing the whole electron transport chain from the PSII donor side up to the PSI, thus decreasing ATP content which limits RuBP regeneration, and hence, the rate of CO 2 assimilation. Energy dissipation is enhanced to protect P-deficient leaves from photo-oxidative damage in high light. </p...|$|E

Our objective was to determine how training affected fruit composition and crop yield {{in a context of}} efficient vineyard management. Training systems were: (i) low single wire (LSW), in which vines were trained to bi-lateral cordons, 1. 0 m above the ground, non-shoot-positioned; (ii) high single wire (HSW), a higher cordon (1. 8 m) version of LSW; (iii) vertically shoot positioned (VSP); (iv) Scott Henry, where canopies of alternate vines were cordon-trained and shoot-positioned upwards (SHU) or downwards (SHD); and (v) minimally pruned (MIN), the same as LSW, except vines were not annually spur-pruned. Crop yields (kg/m of row), over four seasons, averaged 4. 9 (MIN), 2. 9 (combined Scott Henry), 3. 2 (VSP), 2. 6 (HSW) and 2. 9 (LSW). The greatest year-to-year variation in yield occurred with MIN and Scott Henry training. Crop weight of SHD vines was inferior to that of SHU vines in two seasons due to fewer shoots and bunches per vine, and to fewer bunches per shoot. Individual berry weights (g) were consistently least with MIN (0. 89), and greatest with VSP (1. 17). Fruit from all training systems exhibited similar rates of sugar accumulation during two seasons in which repeated measures of fruit maturation were made. Excepting the relatively light yields observed in 1999 - 2000, sugar accumulation was delayed in MIN vines, relative to other training systems, even when MIN harvest was delayed up to two weeks. The delay is most readily explained by the greater crops of MIN vines. Berry total anthocyanins and total phenolics concentrations (mg/g berry fresh wt.) at harvest were not greatly affected by training system. Berry anthocyanins and total phenolics exhibited a negative relationship with crop/m of canopy and a slight positive relationship with bunch exposure when evaluated across all training systems. Experimental plot soil depth and water availability affected cane pruning weights, yield per vine, berry weight, and canopy characteristics. LSW, HSW and MIN training systems all provided good yields of high quality fruit, although MIN did have a tendency to produce excessive crops in some years. VSP and Scott Henry training were less attractive due to their inherently greater canopy management requirements. Tony K. Wolf, Peter R. Dry, Patrick G.
