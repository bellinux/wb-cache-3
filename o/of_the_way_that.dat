5|$|Divergence and convergence: In {{the human}} cerebellum, {{information}} from 200 million mossy fiber inputs is expanded to 40 billion granule cells, whose parallel fiber outputs then converge onto 15 million Purkinje cells. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> they {{are lined up}} longitudinally, the 1000 or so Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone may receive input from as many as 100 million parallel fibers, and focus their own output down {{to a group of}} less than 50 deep nuclear cells. Thus, the cerebellar network receives a modest number of inputs, processes them very extensively through its rigorously structured internal network, and sends out the results via a very limited number of output cells.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{restored}} {{many of the}} old {{financial institutions}} of his grandfather Henry I and undertook further, long-lasting reforms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> the English currency was managed; one result was a long-term increase in the supply of money within the economy, leading to a growth both in trade and inflation. Medieval rulers such as Henry enjoyed various sources of income during the 12th century. Some of their income came from their private estates, called demesne; other income came from imposing legal fines and arbitrary amercements, and from taxes, which at this time were raised only intermittently. Kings could also raise funds by borrowing; Henry did this far more than earlier English rulers, initially through moneylenders in Rouen, turning later in his reign to Jewish and Flemish lenders. Ready cash was increasingly important to rulers during the 12th century to enable the use of mercenary forces and the construction of stone castles, both vital to successful military campaigns.|$|E

25|$|Understanding of {{epistasis}} {{has changed}} considerably through {{the history of}} genetics and so too has {{the use of the}} term. In early models of natural selection devised in the early 20th century, each gene was considered to make its own characteristic contribution to fitness, against an average background of other genes. Some introductory courses still teach population genetics this way. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> the science of population genetics was developed, evolutionary geneticists have tended to think of epistasis as the exception. However, in general, the expression of any one allele depends in a complicated way on many other alleles.|$|E
25|$|Bones protect {{internal}} organs, such as {{the skull}} protecting the brain or the ribs protecting the heart and lungs. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> bone is formed, bone has a high compressive strength of about 170 MPa (1800 kgf/cm²), poor tensile strength of 104–121 MPa, and a very low shear stress strength (51.6 MPa). This means that bone resists pushing(compressional) stress well, resist pulling(tensional) stress less well, but only poorly resists shear stress (such as due to torsional loads). While bone is essentially brittle, bone does have a significant degree of elasticity, contributed chiefly by collagen. The macroscopic yield strength of cancellous bone has been investigated using high resolution computer models.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1990s, much of Chomsky's {{research}} has focused on what he calls the Minimalist Program (MP), in which he departs from much of his past research and instead attempts to simplify language into a system that relates meaning and sound using the minimum possible faculties that could be expected, given certain external conditions that are imposed on us independently. Chomsky dispenses with concepts such as 'deep structure' and 'surface structure' and instead places emphasis on the plasticity of the brain's neural circuits, along with which comes an infinite number of concepts, or 'Logical Forms'. When exposed to linguistic data, the brain of a hearer-speaker then proceeds to associate sound and meaning, and the rules of grammar that we observe are in fact only the consequences, or side effects, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> language works. Thus, while much of Chomsky's prior {{research has}} focused on the rules of language, he now focuses on the mechanisms that the brain uses to create these rules.|$|E

25|$|Patients with SPS {{generally}} have high amounts of high {{glutamic acid decarboxylase}} antibody titers. About 80 percent of SPS patients have GAD antibodies, compared with about {{one percent of the}} general population. The overwhelming majority of people who have GAD antibodies do not contract SPS, indicating that systematic synthesis of the antibody is not the sole cause of SPS. GAD, a presynaptic autoantigen, is generally thought to {{play a key role in}} the condition, but exact details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> autoantibodies affect SPS patients are not known. Most SPS patients with high-titer GAD antibodies also have antibodies that inhibit GABA-receptor-associated protein (GABARAP). Autoantibodies against amphiphysin and gephyrin are also sometimes found in SPS patients. The antibodies appear to interact with antigens in the brain neurons and the spinal cord synapses, causing a functional blockade with gamma-aminobutyric acid. This leads to GABA impairment, which probably causes the stiffness and spasms that characterizes SPS. There are low GABA levels in the motor cortexes of SPS patients.|$|E
