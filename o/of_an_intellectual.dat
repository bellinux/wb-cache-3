5|$|Stebbins and Edgar Anderson wrote a {{paper in}} 1954 on the {{importance}} of hybridization in adapting to new environments. They proposed novel adaptations would facilitate the invasion of habitats not utilized previously by either parent and that novel adaptations may facilitate the formation of stabilized hybrid species. Following this paper, Stebbins developed the first model of adaptive radiation. He proposed that a high degree of genetic variability was necessary for major evolutionary advances, that because of slow mutation rates, genetic recombination was the most likely source of this variation, and that variation could be maximised though hybridization. As of 2006, research is ongoing regarding whether hybridization is an accidental consequence of evolution or if it is necessary for the creation and evolution of plant species; {{it has been argued that}} contemporary studies are part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> lineage that started with the work of Stebbins and Anderson.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} an {{improving}} system of roads in early modern Scotland, it remained a country divided by topography, particularly between the Highlands and Islands and the Lowlands. Most of the economic development was in the Lowlands, which saw the beginnings of industrialisation, agricultural improvement {{and the expansion of}} eastern burghs, particularly Glasgow, as trade routes to the Americas opened up. The local laird emerged as a key figure and the heads of names and clans in the Borders and Highlands declined in importance. There was a population expanding {{towards the end of the}} period and increasing urbanisation. Social tensions were evident in witch trials and the creation of a system of poor laws. Despite the aggrandisement of the crown and the increase in forms of taxation, revenues remained inadequate. The Privy Council and Parliament remained central to government, with changing compositions and importance before the Act of Union in 1707 saw their abolition. The growth of local government saw introduction of Justices of the Peace and Commissioners of Supply, while the law saw the increasing importance of royal authority and professionalisation. The expansion of parish schools and reform of universities heralded the beginnings <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> flowering in the Enlightenment. There was also a flowering of Scottish literature before the loss of the court as a centre of patronage at the beginning of the seventeenth century. The tradition of church music was fundamentally changed by the Reformation, with the loss of complex polyphonic music for a new tradition of metrical psalms singing. In architecture, royal building was strongly influenced by Renaissance styles, while the houses of the great lairds adopted a hybrid form known as Scots baronial and after the Restoration was influenced by Palladian and Baroque styles. In church architecture a distinctive plain style based on a 'T'-plan emerged. The Reformation also had a major impact on art, with a loss of church patronage leading to a tradition of painted ceilings and walls and the beginnings of a tradition of portraiture and landscape painting.|$|E

25|$|In the end, West's anti-Communism {{remained}} {{the centerpiece of}} her politics because she so consistently challenged the Communists as legitimate foes {{of the status quo}} in capitalist countries. In West's view, Communism, like fascism, was merely a form of authoritarianism. Communists were under party discipline and therefore could never speak for themselves. And West was a supreme example <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> who spoke for herself, no matter how her comments might injure her. Indeed, few writers explicitly acknowledged how much West's embrace of unpopular positions hurt her on the left. A whole generation of writers abandoned West and refused to read her, as Doris Lessing suggested.|$|E
25|$|Wolfe dispatches Archie Goodwin {{to secure}} {{a copy of the}} final riddles and their answers for Wolfe's reference, and {{proceeds}} to interview each of the contestants: Gertrude Frazee, the leader of an anti-cosmetics women's group who has been using her members to find the answers for the riddles to try and embarrass the cosmetics industry; Carol Wheelock, a housewife who wants the prize money {{to secure a}} better life for her family; Harold Rollins, a condescending academic who entered the competition as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> exercise; Susan Tescher, a magazine editor who wants to do a profile on Wolfe himself; and Philip Younger, a retiree seeking to recover a fortune he lost during the Great Depression. Although skeptical that Wolfe is only investigating the theft and not the murder, Inspector Cramer shares what the police have learned about the case so far. Other than the financial motive, none of the contestants appears to have had any serious reason or opportunity to either murder Dahlmann or steal the answers, and much to Archie's concern Wolfe's investigation appears to lose energy and focus.|$|E
40|$|Caregivers <b>of</b> {{adults with}} <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> {{disability}} experience depressive symptoms, but the aging factors {{of the care}} recipients associated with the depressive symptoms are unknown. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the onset aging conditions <b>of</b> adults with <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> disability that associated with the depression scores of their primary caregivers. A cross-sectional survey was administered to gather information from 455 caregivers <b>of</b> adults with <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> disability about their symptoms of depression which assessed by a 9 -item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 9). The 12 aging conditions <b>of</b> adults with <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> disability include physical and mental health. The results indicate that 78 % <b>of</b> adults with <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> disability demonstrate aging conditions. Physical conditions associated with aging include hearing decline (66. 3 %), vision decline (63. 6 %), incontinence (44 %), articulation and bone degeneration (57. 9 %), teeth loss (80. 4), physical strength decline (81. 2 %), sense of taste and smell decline (52. 8 %), and accompanied chronic illnesses (74. 6 %). Mental conditions associated with aging include memory loss (77 %), language ability deterioration (74. 4 %), poor sleep quality (74. 2 %), and easy onset of depression and sadness (50. 3 %). Aging conditions <b>of</b> adults with <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> disability (p < 0. 001) was one factor that significantly affected the presence of depressive symptom among caregivers after controlling demographic characteristics. Particularly, poor sleep quality <b>of</b> adults with <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> disability (yes vs. no, OR = 3. 807, p = 0. 002) was statistically correlated to the occurrence of significant depressive symptoms among their caregivers. This study suggests that the authorities should reorient community services and future policies toward the needs of family caregivers to decrease the burdens associated with caregiving.

500|$|A {{number of}} art historians {{have noted the}} {{apparent}} contradiction between the man's plain looks and enigmatic expression. Meiss describes him as [...] "plain and rustic", and finds a resemblance between his rather generic face {{and a number of}} figures in the lower portions of the [...] "Adoration of the Lamb" [...] panel in the Ghent Altarpiece. Agreeing with Panofsky, he observes a [...] "thoughtfulness on the high, wrinkled forehead, visionary force in the dreamy yet steady eyes, [...] a formidable strength of passion in the wide, firm mouth". According to Panofsky, the man's face is not that <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>intellectual,</b> yet he detects a pensive and lonely nature, [...] "the face of one who feels and produces rather than observes and dissects".|$|E
500|$|Fordham {{described}} Mehldau's compositions as [...] "miniature tapestries of taut lyricism {{and surprising}} turns". Mehldau himself indicated {{that some of}} his compositions address a specific need, such as integrating a particular rhythm into his trio, while others emerge from something he has played while improvising. In the latter case, Mehldau likened the difficulty of the composition process to that of a game of chess: [...] "The opening is always easy for me, the middle gets more difficult, more <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> process, more trial and error at work, and the end is always difficult for me." [...] These struggles to find satisfactory endings stem from the tension between needing to close a piece and his desire to leave a sense of open-endedness – [...] "an escape duct of possibility".|$|E

500|$|Writing {{in ancient}} Egypt—both hieroglyphic and hieratic—first {{appeared}} in the late 4th millennium BC during the late phase of predynastic Egypt. By the Old Kingdom (26th century BC to 22nd century BC), literary works included funerary texts, epistles and letters, hymns and poems, and commemorative autobiographical texts recounting the careers of prominent administrative officials. It {{was not until the}} early Middle Kingdom (21st century BC to 17th century BC) that a narrative Egyptian literature was created. This was a [...] "media revolution" [...] which, according to Richard B. Parkinson, {{was the result of the}} rise <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> class of scribes, new cultural sensibilities about individuality, unprecedented levels of literacy, and mainstream access to written materials. However, it is possible that the overall literacy rate was less than one percent of the entire population. The creation of literature was thus an elite exercise, monopolized by a scribal class attached to government offices and the royal court of the ruling pharaoh. However, there is no full consensus among modern scholars concerning the dependence of ancient Egyptian literature on the sociopolitical order of the royal courts.|$|E
500|$|Hamlet {{is often}} played with {{contemporary}} political overtones. Leopold Jessner's 1926 {{production at the}} Berlin Staatstheater portrayed Claudius's court as a parody of the corrupt and fawning court of Kaiser Wilhelm. In Poland, the number of productions of Hamlet has tended to increase at times of political unrest, since its political themes (suspected crimes, coups, surveillance) {{can be used to}} comment on a contemporary situation. Similarly, Czech directors have used the play at times of occupation: a 1941 Vinohrady Theatre production [...] "emphasised, with due caution, the helpless situation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> attempting to endure in a ruthless environment". In China, performances of Hamlet often have political significance: Gu Wuwei's 1916 The Usurper of State Power, an amalgam of Hamlet and Macbeth, was an attack on Yuan Shikai's attempt to overthrow the republic. In 1942, Jiao Juyin directed the play in a Confucian temple in Sichuan Province, to which the government had retreated from the advancing Japanese. In {{the immediate aftermath of the}} collapse of the protests at Tiananmen Square, Lin Zhaohua staged a 1990 Hamlet in which the prince was an ordinary individual tortured by a loss of meaning. In this production, the actors playing Hamlet, Claudius and Polonius exchanged roles at crucial moments in the performance, including the moment of Claudius's death, at which point the actor mainly associated with Hamlet fell to the ground.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Che was {{intended}} to be a much more traditional film based on Jon Lee Anderson's 1997 biography Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life. Actor Benicio del Toro and producer Laura Bickford optioned the film rights to Anderson's book. However, after two years they had not found a suitable writer and the rights expired. During this time, Del Toro and Bickford researched the events depicted in Guerrilla with the idea of exploring Guevara's attempts to start a revolution in Bolivia. Del Toro has said that he previously only thought of Guevara as a [...] "bad guy". For his role, Del Toro spent seven years [...] "obsessively researching" [...] Guevara's life, which made him feel like he [...] "earned his stripes" [...] to interpret the character. Preparation included looking at Guevara's photographs and reading his personal writings. Del Toro read Don Quixote, one of Guevara's favorites, and the first book published and given out free after the Cuban Revolution. Del Toro then personally met with people from different stages of Guevara's life, including Guevara's younger brother and childhood friends, traveling to Cuba where Del Toro met Guevara's widow, family, and [...] "tons of people that loved this man". The visit included a five-minute encounter at a book fair with Fidel Castro, who expressed that he was happy for the [...] "serious" [...] research being undertaken. Such research included collaborating with the three surviving guerrillas from Guevara's ill-fated Bolivian campaign, and with several guerrillas who fought alongside him in Cuba. While researching for both films, Soderbergh made a documentary of his interviews with {{many of the people who}} had fought alongside Guevara. In his encounters with people ranging from fellow guerrillas to Guevara's driver, Del Toro described the reaction as [...] "always the same", stating that he was [...] "blown away" [...] by the [...] "bucketful of love" [...] they still harbored for Guevara. In an interview, Del Toro described Guevara as [...] "a weird combination <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> and an action figure, Gregory Peck and Steve McQueen, wrapped in one". After the film's production concluded, Del Toro professed that [...] "when you tell the story of Che, you're telling a story of the history of a country, so you have to be very careful".|$|E
