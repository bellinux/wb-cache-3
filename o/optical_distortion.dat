Adaptive optics works by measuring the distortions in a wavefront and then compensating for them by rapid changes of actuators applied to a small deformable mirror or with a liquid crystal array filter. AO was first envisioned by Horace W. Babcock in 1953, but did not come into common usage in astronomical telescopes until advances in computer and detector technology during the 1990s {{made it possible to}} calculate the compensation needed in real time. In adaptive optics, the high-speed corrections needed mean that a fairly bright star is needed very close to the target of interest (or an artificial star is created by a laser). Also, with a single star or laser the corrections are only effective over a very narrow field (tens of arcsec), and current systems operating on several 8-10m telescopes work mainly in near-infrared wavelengths for single-object observations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The National Screening Committee {{recommends}} paired macular and nasal digital retinal {{images for}} diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening. Employment of trained retinopathy graders {{is a significant}} cost, and two images per eye increases grading time. Software to mosaic images is available but does not perform accurate registration or {{take account of the}} spherical nature of the retinal surface or <b>optical</b> <b>distortions.</b> Clinically significant data could potentially be hidden in the inaccurate overlap area. The aim was to devise and evaluate a system to accurately combine macular and nasal images into one composite image. Software was developed to register paired images by translation followed by warping to deal with spherical and <b>optical</b> <b>distortions.</b> The warping technique involves the application of thin-plate splines. To evaluate the system, twenty pairs of colour macular and nasal images were selected from a DR screening program. Blood vessels traversing image joins were classified by an experienced clinician. Linear transformation alone does not provide accurate registration of overlapping retinal images. The novel approach of using thin-plate splines accounts for the spherical retinal surface and <b>optical</b> <b>distortions</b> to produce accurate registration. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{is general}} wisdom that likely charged {{colloidal}} particles repel {{each other when}} suspended in liquids. This is in perfect agreement with mean field theories being developed more than 60 years ago. Accordingly, {{it was a big}} surprise when several groups independently reported long-ranged attractive components in the pair potential U(r) of equally charged colloids. This so-called like-charge attraction (LCA) was only observed in thin sample cells while the pair-interaction in unconfined suspensions has been experimentally confirmed to be entirely repulsive. Despite considerable experimental and theoretical efforts, LCA {{remains one of the most}} challenging mysteries in colloidal science. We experimentally reinvestigate the pair-potential U(r) of charged colloidal particles with digital video microscopy and demonstrate that <b>optical</b> <b>distortions</b> in the particles images lead to slightly erroneous particle positions.

While a turret provides a convenient mechanical system to point-and-track the laser beam, the wake flow behind this bluff-body turret is both turbulent and complex with many vortical structures present.

Left untreated, these detrimental aero-optical effects greatly reduce the laser-beam intensity in the far-field...|$|R
