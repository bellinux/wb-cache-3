5|$|The region, {{as defined}} above, has a total {{population}} of about 5 million. The main disambiguation issue in demographics is the self-identifying name of two contemporary groups. The ethnic Macedonian population of the Republic of Macedonia self-identify as Macedonian <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> level, while the Greek Macedonians self-identify as both Macedonian on a regional, and Greek <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> level. According to the Greek arguments, the ancient Macedonians' nationality was Greek and thus, {{the use of the}} term <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> level lays claims to their history. This disambiguation problem has led to a wide variety of terms used to refer to the separate groups, more information of which can be found in the terminology by group section.|$|E

5|$|Since {{electrical}} energy cannot easily {{be stored in}} quantities large enough to meet demands <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required.

5|$|Although cinema, theatre, {{dance and}} live music are popular, the {{favourite}} pastime of the British is watching television. Public broadcast {{television in the}} United Kingdom began in 1936, with {{the launch of the}} BBC Television Service (now BBC One). In the United Kingdom and the Crown dependencies, one must have a television licence to legally receive any broadcast television service, from any source. This includes the commercial channels, cable and satellite transmissions, and the Internet. Revenue generated from the television licence is used to provide radio, television and Internet content for the British Broadcasting Corporation, and Welsh language television programmes for S4C. The BBC, the common abbreviation of the British Broadcasting Corporation, is the world's largest broadcaster. Unlike other broadcasters in the UK, it is a public service based, quasi-autonomous, statutory corporation run by the BBC Trust. Free-to-air terrestrial television channels available <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> basis are BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, Channel 4 (S4C in Wales), and Five.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reform}} period, the Communist regime in China {{regulated}} birth control. The government shaped policies {{with the intention}} to develop population science “through selective absorption of Western science and technology.” In 1979, the Planned Birth Policy was implemented. The Chinese government only allowed one child per Han family, with more children allowed to non-Han families. Since this planned birth policy was implemented based on local laws rather than <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> population law, the level of birth restriction differed in urban and rural areas. In families reliant on farming for income, the household is the fundamental unit of production, so many rural families would rather pay the hefty fines for excess birth.|$|E
5|$|From 4 September 1939 to 19 June 1940, Styer was {{a student}} at the Army Industrial College. He became the {{commanding}} officer of the 8th Engineer Squadron at Fort McIntosh, Texas, from 3 August to 24 November 1940, and was executive officer of the Engineer Replacement Center at Fort Humphreys and Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. On 12 December 1940, he was assigned to the Construction Division in the Office of the Quartermaster General. The US Army was about to embark <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> mobilization, and it was the task of the Construction Division to prepare the necessary accommodations and training facilities for the vast army that would be created. This enormous construction program had been dogged by bottlenecks, shortages, delays, spiralling costs, and poor living conditions at the construction sites, and newspapers published accounts charging it with incompetence, ineptitude, and inefficiency.|$|E

Universally accepted priorities include management directives which allow natural fires to burn unhindered under prescribed conditions. As in the 1988 fires, protection of lives and property continue to take precedence in all fire fighting efforts.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{felt the}} money from the bonds should not go to the soldiers, but the speculators that had bought the bonds from the soldiers, who had shown little faith in the country's future. The process of {{attempting}} to track down the original bond holders along with the government showing discrimination among the classes of holders if the war veterans were to be compensated also weighed in as factors for Hamilton. As for the state debts, Hamilton suggested to consolidate it with the national debt and label it as federal debt, for the sake of efficiency <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> scale.|$|E

These included theories from Adam Smith, extensive studies on the Bank of England, the blunders of the Bank of North America and his experience in establishing the Bank of New York. He also used American records from James Wilson, Pelatiah Webster, Gouverneur Morris, and from his assistant Treasury secretary Tench Coxe.|$|E
