The installation was the first <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> to be deployed {{without the use of}} any offshore heavy lift vessels as the turbine was fully commissioned onshore prior to the unit's being towed offshore.

40|$|The {{safety and}} {{reliability}} margin of <b>offshore</b> floating <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> {{need to be}} higher than that of onshore <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> due to larger environmental loads and higher operational and maintenance costs for <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> compared to onshore <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> However rotor cyclic loads coupled with 6 DOFs motions of the substructure, amplifies the fatigue damage in <b>offshore</b> floating <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> In general a lower fatigue design factor is used for <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> compared to that of the stationary oil and gas platforms. This is because the consequence of a failure in <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> in general is lower than that of the offshore oil and gas platforms. In <b>offshore</b> floating <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> a sub-system fault in the electrical system and blade pitch angle controller also induces additional fatigue loading on the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> structure...|$|R

40|$|<b>Offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are {{now being}} {{considered}} {{for use in the}} United States. Ensuring proper design of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> and <b>wind</b> farms requires knowledge of the external conditions in which the turbines and associated facilities are to operate. The primary external conditions are due to the wind and waves. Also, for many locations, floating ice will also be {{a major factor in the}} design. This review examines the following aspects of external conditions for the design of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> for the United States: (1) design requirements, (2) available offshore data sources, (3) data estimation and extrapolation techniques, (4) on-site data collection, and (5) likely sources of extreme events, including hurricanes and northeast storms. <b>Offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>turbine</b> design <b>Offshore</b> <b>wind</b> systems data...|$|R

25|$|In June 2013, the University of Maine {{made history}} with its VolturnUS 1:8, a 65-foot-tall {{floating}} turbine prototype that is 1:8th {{the scale of}} a 6-megawatt (MW), 450-foot rotor diameter design. VolturnUS 1:8 was the first grid-connected <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> deployed in the Americas. The VolturnUS design utilizes a concrete semisubmersible floating hull and a composite materials tower designed to reduce both capital and Operation & Maintenance costs, and to allow local manufacturing throughout the US and the World. The VolturnUS technology {{is the culmination of}} collaborative research and development conducted by the University of Maine-led DeepCwind Consortium. U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King announced in June 2016 that Maine’s New England Aqua Ventus I floating offshore wind demonstration project, designed by the DeepCwind Consortium, has been selected by the U.S. Department of Energy to participate in the Offshore Wind Advanced Technology Demonstration program.|$|E

40|$|It {{is clear}} that the safety and {{integrity}} of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> will be considerably improved through the availability and use of relevant and reliable design standards. Although national certification rules and standards for <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> have been published in Germany and Denmark, there is an evident need for an international standard for <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> This need has been recognised within the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and a Working Group (TC 88 WG 3) has been established to develop such a standard. The declared objective of this Working Group is “to develop an international standard for the engineering and technical requirements which should be considered during design in order {{to ensure the safety of}} systems and components of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines,</b> inclusive of their support structures”. The standard will be documented in IEC 61400 - 3 and will cover only those issues relevant to <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines,</b> fully consistent with but not duplicating the equivalent onshore <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> design standard IEC 61400 - 1.

25|$|Belfast's skyline {{is still}} {{dominated}} today by Harland & Wolff's famous twin gantry cranes, Samson and Goliath, built in 1974 and 1969 respectively. There is also speculation about a resurgence in {{the prosperity of}} the shipyard thanks to the company's diversification into emerging technologies, particularly in renewable energy development, such as <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> and tidal power construction, which may {{provide an opportunity to}} further improve the company's fortunes in the long term. For example, the United Kingdom planned to build 7,500 new offshore wind turbines between 2008 and 2020, creating great demand for heavy assembly work. Unlike land-based wind turbines, where assembly occurs on site, offshore wind turbines have part of their assembly done in a shipyard, and then construction barges transport the tower sections, rotors, and nacelles to the site for final erection and assembly. As a result of this, in late 2007, the 'Goliath' gantry crane was re-commissioned, having been moth-balled in 2003 {{due to the lack of}} heavy-lifting work at the yard.|$|E
25|$|Ideol’s {{engineers}} have developed and patented a ring-shaped floating foundation {{based on a}} central opening system (Damping Pool) used for optimizing foundation + wind turbine stability. As such, the sloshing water contained in this central opening counteracts the swell-induced floater oscillations. Foundation-fastened mooring lines are simply attached to the seabed to hold the assembly in position. This floating foundation is compatible with all wind turbines without any modification and has reduced dimensions (from 36 to 55 metres per side for a wind turbine between 2 and 8 MW). Manufacturable in concrete or steel, this floating foundation allows for local construction near project sites. Ideol leads the FLOATGEN project, a floating wind turbine demonstration project based on Ideol’s technology and planned to be built by Bouygues Travaux Publics and installed by mid-2017 {{off the coast of}} Le Croisic on the offshore experimentation site of Ecole Centrale de Nantes (SEM-REV).
