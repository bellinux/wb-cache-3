500|$|The developers' {{theory is}} that the {{international}} attention gained through large developments and having the world's tallest building will incur gentrification of the country and even be a financial success in the long run. Rory Olcayto, deputy editor of The Architects’ Journal, said [...] "The race to build the highest skyscraper is quite futile – where do you stop? These buildings are a symbol of an <b>old-fashioned</b> <b>way</b> of thinking,” while architect Adrian Smith, the designer of the tower, states, [...] "...this tower symbolizes the Kingdom as an important global business and cultural leader, and demonstrates the strength and creative vision of its people. It represents new growth and high-performance technology fused into one powerful iconic form." [...] However, Bob Sinn, principal engineer at Thornton Tomasetti, stated that the practical challenges of building supertall buildings are greater than the structural challenges.|$|E

500|$|At {{the insistence}} of {{publishers}} Grosset & Dunlap, the Nancy Drew books were revised beginning in 1959, both to make the books more modern and to eliminate racist stereotypes. Although Harriet Adams felt that these changes were unnecessary, she oversaw a complete overhaul of the series, as well as writing new volumes {{in keeping with the}} new guidelines laid down by Grosset & Dunlap. The series did not so much eliminate racial stereotypes, however, as eliminate non-white characters altogether. For example, in the original version of The Hidden Window Mystery (1956), Nancy visits friends in the south whose African-American servant, [...] "lovable old Beulah... serves squabs, sweet potatoes, corn pudding, piping hot biscuits, and strawberry shortcake." [...] The mistress of the house waits until Beulah has left the room and then says to Nancy, [...] "I try to make things easier for Beulah but she insists on cooking and serving everything the <b>old-fashioned</b> <b>way.</b> I must confess, though, that I love it." [...] In the revised 1975 version, Beulah is changed to Anna, a [...] "plump, smiling housekeeper".|$|E
500|$|Zinta next {{starred in}} Samir Karnik's Heroes (2008), a road movie about two final-year film {{students}} who, {{as a part}} of their assignment, travel a thousand miles across North India to deliver three un-posted letters written by army personnel who lost their lives during the 1999 Kargil war to their families. The story unfolds the journey of these students in three chapters and follows how they meet and are inspired by the families of the soldiers. Zinta is featured in the first chapter as Salman Khan's war widow, Kuljeet Kaur, a woman who becomes the sole breadwinner of the family and single-handedly raises her son. In preparation for the role, Zinta attended Anupam Kher's acting school, [...] "Actor Prepares" [...] to learn the dialect and mannerisms of a Punjabi woman. The film was released to a mixed critical reaction, but her performance received rave reviews; Anand Singh of Hindustan Times wrote, [...] "Karnik is merely interested in wringing tears the <b>old-fashioned</b> <b>way,</b> and not in starting a debate. He succeeds—mainly because Preity Zinta brings to a role a gravitas and dignity that is seen on the faces of ordinary women—this may be her coming of age as an actress." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to a request from Arnold-Forster, French submitted a memorandum (7 March 1904) arguing that cavalry still needed to fight the <b>old-fashioned</b> <b>way</b> as a European War would begin with a [...] "great cavalry battle". [...] He also sent a copy to the King. [...] In {{response to}} Roberts’ claim {{that he wanted to}} give cavalry the ability to act independently, French wrote in the margin that the campaigns of early 1900 had seen cavalry acting independently, although he replied politely that their differences were not as great as Roberts seemed to think. [...] Roberts had the support of Kitchener (who thought cavalry should be able to seize and hold positions, but not to roam about the battlefield looking for enemy cavalry), but he was away as Commander-in-Chief, India. French was supported by Baden-Powell (Inspector-General of Cavalry), Sir Francis Grenfell (who commented that he had not spoken to any junior officer who agreed with Roberts) and Evelyn Wood. In February 1905, after Roberts' removal as Commander-in-Chief, the Army Council authorised the publication of Haig’s [...] "Cavalry Training" [...] but without Roberts’ preface, although the lance was declared abolished as a weapon of war—a decision ignored by French, who allowed his lancer regiments at Aldershot to carry the lance in field training.|$|E
2500|$|Farmiga later {{withdrew from}} the project as she had become {{pregnant}} with her second child, and Riseborough replaced her. After Farmiga had declined the project, Madonna looked into many actresses, before zeroing on Riseborough, whom she had seen as a young Margaret Thatcher in the BBC film The Long Walk to Finchley. Madonna explained her choice: [...] "I {{was looking for a}} certain quality: something fragile, androgynous and yet feminine in a really <b>old-fashioned</b> <b>way.</b> When I saw Andrea, I knew immediately she was the one." [...] Cornish commented on her role as Winthrop, [...] "Madonna is a strong, independent woman who doesn't need a man to define her– and that's admirable. She's studied every aspect of what happened with Wallis Simpson and Edward VIII. [...] It's a fascinating insight into class and romance. Madonna's created a contemporary woman—who I will play—called Wally, who is fascinated by what happened to Mrs. Simpson." [...] Madonna's daughter Lourdes was offered a part, but Madonna decided against the idea. However, she later allowed Lourdes to appear for a minor role in the film. The part she played was later confirmed by Cornish in an interview in March 2011 as the younger self of her character Wally Winthrop.|$|E
