500|$|After {{discovering}} {{they were}} £60,000 in debt, Blur toured the United States in 1992 {{in an attempt}} to recoup their financial losses. The group released the single [...] "Popscene" [...] to coincide with the start of the tour. Featuring [...] "a rush of punk guitars, '60s pop hooks, blaring British horns, controlled fury, and postmodern humor", [...] "Popscene" [...] was a turning point for the band musically. However, upon its release it only charted at number 32. [...] "We felt 'Popscene' was a big departure; a very, very English record", Albarn told the NME in 1993, [...] "But that annoyed a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> ... <b>We</b> put ourselves out on a limb to pursue this English ideal and no-one was interested." [...] As a result of the single's lacklustre performance, plans to release a single named [...] "Never Clever" [...] were scrapped and work on Blur's second album was pushed back.|$|E

[...] Berridge also claimed the show didn't set out to look for an Asian family, saying: [...] "We wanted a new family as there were various elements missing from the show. I thought we were short on males and needed a surge of testosterone," [...] and said that the characters were formed around the actors: [...] "We didn't set out knowing exactly what we wanted. We workshopped constantly, trying out different improvisations with the actors and the characters evolved." ...|$|E

500|$|Joy Division {{made their}} {{recorded}} debut in June 1978 when the band self-released An Ideal for Living, {{and two weeks}} later a track of theirs, [...] "At a Later Date", was featured on the compilation album [...] (which had been recorded live in October 1977). In the Melody Maker review of the EP, Chris Brazier said that it [...] "has the familiar rough-hewn nature of home-produced records, but they're no mere drone-vendors—there {{are a lot of}} good ideas here, and they could be a very interesting band by now, seven months on". The packaging of An Ideal for Living—which featured a drawing of a Hitler Youth member on the cover—coupled with the nature of the band's name, fuelled speculation about their political affiliations. While Hook and Sumner later admitted to being intrigued by fascism at the time, Morris insisted that the group's obsession with Nazi imagery came from a desire to keep memories of the sacrifices of their parents and grandparents during World War II alive. He argued that accusations of neo-Nazi sympathies merely provoked the band [...] "to keep on doing it, because that's the kind <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>we</b> are".|$|E
500|$|After Marker saw Manson's group Angelfish on 120 Minutes, {{the band}} {{invited her to}} Vig and Marker's Smart Studios to sing {{on a couple of}} songs, but after a [...] "dreadful" [...] first audition, she {{returned}} to Angelfish. Manson eventually returned to Smart for a successful second time, where she began to work on the then-skeletal [...] "Queer", [...] "Vow" [...] and [...] "Stupid Girl". Working on the lyrics, [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] became an [...] "anthem for a girl who won't settle for less than what she wants". Later she added, [...] " [...] really about squandering potential, [...] our version of Madonna's 'Express Yourself', but a little more subversive". Manson aimed the song as a rebuke towards a friend's foolish behaviour: [...] "A lot of females still find it difficult to find their own voice in society. It's just that women have a different set of problems from men... make the most of your potential." [...] Manson added that [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] was [...] "a song of reproach to a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>we</b> know", both male and female, and that [...] "we could have called it 'Stupid Guy,' but we thought another song about a strident female dissing a guy would be tedious." ...|$|E

[...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white.

Masters' friend, William Higgins, had been recording sound for his films (but not using it) since 1978, and Falcon Studios released their first sound film in 1979. [...] "I hated sound at this time. [...] Because of my experience with Greek Lightning, partially, and I said, 'What will sound do for these films except make them ludicrous?' Because the kind <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>we</b> use in these films can't talk, can't act, have no background—they can't {{do any of these}} things, and it's just going to be absurd to make them say things when they aren't going to say them well." ...|$|E

Rand's characters often personify her view of the archetypes of various schools of philosophy for living and working in the world. Robert James Bidinotto wrote, [...] "Rand rejected the literary convention that depth and plausibility demand characters who are naturalistic replicas of the kinds <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>we</b> meet in everyday life, uttering everyday dialogue and pursuing everyday values.

He intends to not only grow his own life-sustaining ghola, but to resurrect the rest of his order as well.

Stevens hired Margaret Atwood, daughter of Anchorage Times publisher Robert Atwood, who was chairman of the Alaska Statehood Committee, to work with him in the Interior Department.

[...] "e were lobbying from the executive branch, and there's been a statute against that for a long time.... We more or less, I would say, masterminded the House and Senate attack from the executive branch." [...] Stevens and the younger Atwood created file cards on members of Congress based on [...] "whether they were Rotarians or Kiwanians or Catholics or Baptists and veterans or loggers, the whole thing," [...] Stevens said in the 1977 interview. [...] "And we'd assigned these Alaskans to go talk to individual members of the Senate and split them down on the basis of people that had something in common with them." [...] The lobbying campaign extended to presidential press conferences. [...] "We set Ike up quite often at press conferences by planting questions about Alaska statehood," [...] Stevens said in the 1977 interview. [...] "We never let a press conference go by without getting someone to try to ask him about statehood." [...] Newspapers were also targeted, according to Stevens.

2500|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the Boston Globe {{disclosed}} that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, Weeks met with retired agent John Connolly (later sentenced to 40 years in prison), who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, [...] "The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them." [...] According to Weeks, [...] "As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly kept telling me that 90 percent of {{the information in the}} files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told me, he had to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other know what was going on. I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As I continued to read, I could see {{that a lot of the}} reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>we</b> had done business with, of friends of mine. Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, I would read exactly what it said about that person. I would see, over and over again, that some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me to realize that it had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. If there was some investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he obviously had. I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife and to your girlfriends, but not to your friends. Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't lied to me. But they sure hadn't been telling me everything." ...|$|E
