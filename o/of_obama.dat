5|$|Jackson has {{a lengthy}} {{relationship}} with Obama. Obama's Illinois State Senate 13th district that he served from 1997–2005 was within Jackson's district. Jackson's sister Santita {{was a close}} friend of Michelle Obama and served as a bridesmaid at the Obama wedding. In 2008, Jackson's father, Jesse Jackson, wrote an op-ed in the Chicago Sun-Times attacking presidential candidate Obama for his lack of activist involvement; Jackson Junior responded sharply in the same paper with a defense <b>of</b> <b>Obama.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pritzker was {{a member}} of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. She also served on the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board. Although she was less active in the 2012 Obama {{campaign}} than she had been four years prior, she served as national co-chair <b>of</b> <b>Obama</b> for America 2012. She was also on the board of directors of the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan think tank focused on world affairs and U.S. foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|ABC News {{reported}} that Harper's chief of staff, Ian Brodie {{was responsible for}} the details reaching the hands of the media. Harper has denied that Brodie {{was responsible for the}} leak, and launched an investigation to find the source. The Opposition, as well as Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, criticized the Government on the issue, stating they were trying to help the Republicans by helping Hillary Clinton win the Democratic nomination instead <b>of</b> <b>Obama.</b> They also alleged the leak would hurt relations with the United States if Obama ever were to become President. Obama was elected President in November. In February, Obama made his first foreign visit, as president, to Ottawa, in which he affirmed support for free trade with Canada, as well as complimenting Canada on its involvement in Afghanistan.|$|E
50|$|The title <b>of</b> <b>Obama's</b> 2006 memoir, The Audacity of Hope, was {{inspired}} by one of Wright's sermons. This sermon also was the source for themes <b>of</b> <b>Obama's</b> 2004 keynote address to the Democratic National Convention.|$|R
50|$|During Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, Bleich was a {{founding}} member and co-chair <b>of</b> <b>Obama's</b> national finance committee, co-chair <b>of</b> <b>Obama's</b> higher education advisory board, and California co-chair. He donated to Hillary Clinton and raised funds for her to retire her campaign's debt after the Democratic primary.|$|R

5|$|The {{election}} {{took place}} on November 4, and Barack Obama was projected the winner at about 11:00 pm Eastern Standard Time; McCain delivered his concession speech in Phoenix, Arizona about twenty minutes later. In it, he noted the historic and special significance <b>of</b> <b>Obama</b> becoming the nation's first African American president. In the end, McCain won 173 electoral college votes to Obama's 365; McCain failed to win most of the battleground states and lost some traditionally Republican ones. McCain gained 46percent of the nationwide popular vote, compared to Obama's 53percent.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, 2008, McCain {{revealed}} Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as {{his surprise}} choice for running mate. McCain {{was only the}} second U.S. major-party presidential nominee (after Walter Mondale) to select a woman for his running mate and the first Republican to do so; Palin would have become the first female Vice President of the United States if McCain had been elected. On September 3, 2008, McCain and Palin became the Republican Party's presidential and vice presidential nominees, respectively, at the 2008 Republican National Convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota. McCain surged ahead <b>of</b> <b>Obama</b> in national polls following the convention, as the Palin pick energized core Republican voters who had previously been wary of him. However, by the campaign's own later admission, the rollout of Palin to the national media went poorly, and voter reactions to Palin grew increasingly negative, especially among independents and other voters concerned about her qualifications.|$|E
25|$|The December 8, 1995 Chicago Reader {{cover story}} was a laudatory eight-page profile <b>of</b> <b>Obama</b> that noted Palmer's {{endorsement}} <b>of</b> <b>Obama</b> and her {{promise not to}} run against him if she lost the November 28 special primary election for Reynolds' vacated congressional seat.|$|E

25|$|The {{day after}} the election, a poll {{conducted}} by CSA for Le Parisien found that 84% of those polled {{were satisfied with the}} election <b>of</b> <b>Obama,</b> while 6% were dissatisfied and 10% expressed no opinion.|$|E
25|$|During the 2008 US presidential campaign, Unger was in {{frequent}} {{contact with}} candidate Barack Obama via email and Blackberry. He {{has since become}} critical of the Obama administration, and called for the defeat <b>of</b> <b>Obama</b> in the 2012 election {{as a first step}} to remaking the Democratic party.|$|E
25|$|Republican and {{conservative}} supporters <b>of</b> <b>Obama</b> included elected officials, former elected officials, academics, commentators, and retired military officers. According to exit polls on Election Day, 9% {{of those who}} identified themselves as Republicans voted for Barack Obama, up slightly from the 6% of self-identified Republicans who voted for John Kerry in 2004.|$|E

25|$|After the {{election}} <b>of</b> <b>Obama</b> for president, Republicans in Congress were unified in almost total {{opposition to the}} programs and policies <b>of</b> <b>Obama</b> and the Democratic majority. They unsuccessfully attempted to stop an $814 billion stimulus spending program, new regulations on investment firms, and a program to require health insurance for all Americans. They did keep emissions trading from coming to a vote, and vow {{to continue to work}} to convince Americans that burning fossil fuel does not cause global warming. The slow growth of the economy {{in the first two years}} of the Obama administration led Republicans to call for a return to tax cuts and deregulation of businesses, which they perceived as the best way to solve the financial crisis. Obama's approval rating steadily declined in his first year in office before leveling off at about 50-50. This decline in popularity led to a GOP landslide in the mid-term elections of 2010.|$|E
25|$|Another {{accusation}} is that Obama {{refuses to}} say the Pledge of Allegiance. This {{is based on a}} Time magazine picture <b>of</b> <b>Obama</b> listening to the U.S. National Anthem with his hands at his sides while the others on stage have their right hands over their hearts. He does, in fact, say the Pledge and sometimes led the Senate in doing so.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the crucial}} {{questions}} after Obama's speech was what effect (if any) the speech would have on voters {{in terms of their}} overall opinion <b>of</b> <b>Obama</b> and their willingness to vote for him in the remaining Democratic primaries and in the general election. Critical to these questions was the extent to which voters identified Obama with the views of Jeremiah Wright.|$|E

25|$|While Obama set a conciliatory {{tone for}} his {{relations}} with Venezuela during his candidacy, saying {{he would be willing}} to meet with Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez without preconditions at a July 23, 2007, presidential debate, the Venezuelan leader had been fickle in his opinion <b>of</b> <b>Obama.</b> Even during the election he varied from liking Obama to saying that nothing would change with the US.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, 88% of Romney {{voters were}} white, while 56% <b>of</b> <b>Obama</b> voters were white. In the 2008 presidential election, John McCain won 55% of white votes, 35% of Asian votes, 31% of Hispanic votes, and 4% of African American votes. In the 2010 House election, Republicans won 60% {{of the white}} votes, 38% of Hispanic votes, and 9% of the African American vote.|$|E
25|$|Despite public polling showing Romney behind Obama in {{the swing}} states of Nevada, Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio, and New Hampshire, tied with Obama in Virginia, and just barely ahead <b>of</b> <b>Obama</b> in Florida, the Romney {{campaign}} said they were genuinely surprised by the loss, having believed that public polling was oversampling Democrats. The Romney campaign had already set up a transition website, and had scheduled and purchased a fireworks display to celebrate in case he won the election.|$|E
50|$|Caroline Kennedy {{was among}} the 35 {{national}} co-chairs <b>of</b> <b>Obama's</b> 2012 re-election campaign. On June 27, 2012, Kennedy made appearances in Nashua and Manchester, New Hampshire, to campaign for the re-election <b>of</b> President <b>Obama.</b>|$|R

50|$|In February 2012, Taitz {{sued the}} Mississippi state Democratic Party and the Mississippi Secretary <b>of</b> State alleging <b>Obama</b> {{was not a}} natural born citizen. Taitz accused the party of aiding and abetting in forgery and fraud when it {{submitted}} to the court a copy <b>of</b> <b>Obama's</b> birth certificate. In response, the party filed with the court a certified verification from Hawaii's State Registrar attesting to the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>Obama's</b> birth certificate. Taitz accused the registrar of being complicit with the forgery.|$|R
25|$|Another {{incident}} {{involved a}} violation of procedure in which an armed security guard for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rode in the same elevator as President Barack Obama {{during a visit to}} that agency's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, to discuss U.S. response to the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. The guard used his phone to record a video <b>of</b> <b>Obama</b> and refused to comply with a request to stop. The guard had been arrested multiple times in the past, but had never been convicted of a crime.|$|E
25|$|On November 30, 2012, it was {{revealed}} that shortly before the election, internal polling done by the Romney campaign had shown Romney ahead in Colorado and New Hampshire, tied in Iowa, and within a few points <b>of</b> <b>Obama</b> in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Ohio. In addition, the Romney campaign had assumed that they would win Florida and Virginia. The polls had made Romney and his campaign team so confident of their victory that Romney did not write a concession speech until Obama's victory was announced.|$|E
25|$|The Project for Excellence in Journalism and Harvard University's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy {{conducted}} a study of 5,374 media narratives and assertions about the presidential candidates from January 1 through March 9, 2008. The study found that Obama received 69% favorable coverage and Clinton received 67%, compared to only 43% favorable media coverage of McCain. Another study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University found the media coverage <b>of</b> <b>Obama</b> to be 72% negative from June 8 to July 21 compared to 57% negative for McCain. An October 29 study found 29% of stories about Obama to be negative, compared to 57% of stories about McCain being negative.|$|E
