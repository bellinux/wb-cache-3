Some large transformers employ electric fans for forced-air cooling, pumps for forced-liquid cooling, or have heat exchangers for water-cooling.

5000|$|The TA was {{replaced}} by the TB Midget in May 1939. It had a smaller but more modern XPAG engine as fitted to the Morris Ten Series M, but in a more highly tuned state and like the TA with twin SU carburettors. This 1250 cc I4 unit featured a slightly less undersquare 66.6 mm bore and 90 mm stroke and had a maximum power output of [...] at 5200 rpm.

The landing gear is a fixed monowheel and two wing-mounted outrigger wheels that support the wing during taxiing. The engine is a Curtiss snowmobile engine that turns at a maximum rpm of 6000, powering the propeller through an <b>oil-immersed</b> 2:1 chain reduction drive, giving a propeller speed of 3000 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|The DP70 {{consists}} of a monocoque, cast iron chassis containing the mechanism, which is completely <b>oil-immersed</b> on the non-operating side. Jan-Jacob Kotte believed {{that the use of}} heavier materials to absorb vibration reduced instability in the projected image, and this is certainly reflected {{in the design of the}} DP70: a complete outfit, including the bases and reel magazines, weighs 1,004 lbs - literally half a ton! The DP70 was also significantly more expensive than any single gauge theater projector on the market: a US customer was quoted $6,225 for one in 1966 ($44,942 in 2014, adjusted for CPI inflation), which was around the cost of a typical three-bedroom suburban home at the time. [...] The price asked for a double set without lenses asked in West-Germany in 1956 was 42,510.00 Marks, which at the rate of exchange at that time (4:1), related to 10,627.50 $ for the pair, or 5,313.75 $ per projector. That price was higher, than 35mm only projectors, but still reasonably low if compared to competitors like Bauer U2. The low price and reasonable quality was an important part of the success. Because the DP70 was built to commission for a customer in the United States, it is a very unusual example of a European-designed piece of industrial machinery with fasteners that have SAE rather than metric dimensions.|$|E
50|$|The Scammell Townsman {{replaced}} the 3-ton Scarab. There was {{no provision for}} a 6-ton model; more conventional vehicles were used {{to take on the}} heavier role. The Townsman closely followed the Scarab in its basic design. The frame was of a welded construction and had integral coupling ramps fitted with Scammell Mechanical Horse automatic coupling. The engine, gearbox and driving axle formed a rigid assembly pivoted at the front end in a large rubber bush. A vacuum operated release mechanism {{replaced the}} hand lever mechanism used in the Scarab. The futuristic lines of the fibreglass cab were a novelty. Use of GRP for the cab had allowed for a more complex shape to be employed. Scammell had experience with GRP cabs in heavy lorries such as the Routeman, Trunker and Handyman with cabs designed by Michelotti. The new cab had many new developments, such as vacuum-assisted hydraulic brakes, a heater-demister, two rear view mirrors, interior sun-visors, totally enclosed <b>oil-immersed</b> coil spring front suspension and dual rate mounting of semi-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. Later a larger engine was fitted; the Leyland OE160, being an in-house product due to Scammell being part of the Leyland Group. The Townsman had better driver controls and faster road speed (50 mph) but still lacked brakes on all wheels; only the rear axle had brakes. Legislation in the late 1960s regarding braking of goods vehicles meant that the working days of the innovative Scammells was nearing an end.|$|E

A more precise method to determine load-carrying capability of <b>oil-immersed</b> power transformers, which is admissible with valid technological normative documents, is offered and reasoned. The major attention focuses on {{the analysis of the}} requirements of the technological normative documents on selecting the rated capacity of <b>oil-immersed</b> power transformers. The authors present the critical analysis of the well-established and extremely simplified method for ratedcapacity selection of power transformers and justify its inconsistence. The paper shows that all the methods for selecting power-transformers rated capacity are the simplifications of the transformers load-capability assessment method based on thermal transient-processes computations. It is reasoned that the requirements of any transformer  operational-mode acceptability can be most precisely expressed in the form of critical-point allowable temperatures and the allowable overload-factors used in most applied methods are only indirectly calculated values. Allowable-temperature critical points regimented by the technological normative documents are cited.    The authors point to possible errors of the simplified selection-methods for rated capacity of <b>oil-immersed</b> transformers and adduce the computation results of the mathematical modeling of the thermal transient-processes under simplified conditions assumption to illustrate the  possible errors.
