Eliezer's house <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of Serpent Street was in the larger ghetto in the town centre, so his family was able to stay at home, though the windows on the non-ghetto side had to be boarded up.|$|E
5|$|The town of Herne Bay {{took its}} name from the {{neighbouring}} village of Herne, two kilometres inland from the bay. The word herne, meaning a place <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of land, evolved from the Old English hyrne, meaning corner. The village was first recorded in around 1100 as Hyrnan. The corner may relate to the sharp turn in the minor Roman road between Canterbury and Reculver at Herne.|$|E
5|$|Situated in the Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Macon Library was the {{eleventh}} Carnegie library–libraries built with a donation from businessman and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie–to be constructed {{as part of}} the Brooklyn Public Library system. Costing $93,481 ($71,481 for the building and its furnishings plus an additional $22,000 for the site), the library was designed by Richard A. Walker of Walker & Morris and built in 1907 <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> lot at the intersection of Macon Street and Lewis Avenue. The library's construction was conducted by Daniel Ryan of Manhattan. In 1906, the New York City Board of Estimate designated $10,000 for the library's collection. The branch library's opening on July 15, 1907, was attended by 2,000 visitors. Upon its opening, Macon held 10,000 books with the space to expand to 25,000.|$|E

5|$|The Robillon wing {{contains}} an {{entrance to the}} palace reached by flights of ingeniously designed graduated steps. Their design creates an illusion of a longer and higher perspective, centred <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of a terrace because of exigencies of the site, and divided mid-flight {{so as not to}} lead the eye and footstep towards an angle of the colonnade beyond. The steps are adorned with elaborate statuary (see key 11). The bays of the façade are stuccoed rose-pink, contrasting with the motifs and pilasters in natural stone (see illustration).|$|E
5|$|The Tower House is <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of Melbury Road, {{just north}} of Kensington High Street, in the {{district}} of Holland Park. It stands opposite Stavordvale Lodge and next to Woodland House, built for the artist Luke Fildes. The development of Melbury Road in the grounds of Little Holland House created an art colony in Holland Park, the Holland Park Circle. Its most prominent member, Frederic, Lord Leighton, lived at Leighton House, 12 Holland Park Road, and at the time of Leighton's death in 1896 six Royal Academicians, as well as one associate member, were living in Holland Park Road and Melbury Road.|$|E
5|$|In 1731, the {{government}} purchased houses {{at the site}} of the present building and construction of a new building started the next year. The Sabor first met in the new building on 6 May 1737. The building was originally designed to accommodate archives, the court and the office of the ban; however, {{the government}} of Zagreb County moved in as well in 1765. The ban's office, the court and the archives moved out of the building in 1807, when a building across St. Mark's Square was bought to accommodate them. Subsequently, the newly purchased building was named Banski dvori after its new primary purpose of housing the ban and his office. The Zagreb County government purchased buildings adjacent to the parliament in 1839 and commissioned a new building at the site. It was completed in 1849; in the meantime, the Sabor had to convene elsewhere; it met in a theatre building located <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of the square. The theatre building later became the Zagreb City Hall.|$|E

5|$|In February 1976, Koubek {{contributed a}} third {{high-rise}} office building to Farragut Square, {{this one a}} brick-and-solarized glass structure with a glass-and-aluminum penthouse at 818 Connecticut Avenue NW. His massive, grid-like 400 North Capitol Street, {{one of the few}} office buildings he designed with a plaza between two wings, opened in June. His 12-story International Square building—with its inverted setbacks above the Farragut West Washington Metro station, ninth-floor balcony with non-structural columns, interior atrium, and ground level set-back retail concourse—opened in November. Originally just a single office building <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> for a city block, it expanded to occupy nearly the entire block with the addition of two almost identical towers in 1979 and 1980. (The atrium was upgraded and a fountain added in 1992.) Two blocks to the west, in April 1977 Koubek also designed a fairly nondescript office building at 1990 K Street NW.|$|E
5|$|The early {{breakaway}} included four riders. These were Thomas Voeckler (Direct Énergie), Matthew Brammeier (Dimension Data), Florian Vachon (Fortuneo–Vital Concept) and Evaldas Siskevicius (Delko–Marseille Provence KTM). They {{were not}} allowed to build a large advantage, with the peloton keeping them just a few minutes ahead. The main action of the day came on the second-category final climb. In the breakaway, now just a minute ahead, Voeckler attacked and dropped the other breakaway riders. Nathan Haas (Dimension Data) attacked the peloton {{at the top of the}} climb, but made a mistake <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> and ended up in a field. On the climb, Marcel Kittel and Arnaud Démare were dropped, with Démare then pulling out of the race. Geraint Thomas was one of several riders to crash on the climb, but he was able to return to the peloton.|$|E

It is said that Cortés built it for La Malinche, and historians believe Cortés had his Spanish wife, Catalina Juárez de Marcaida, murdered there. In spite of the house’s historic and aesthetic value, it receives little attention. The {{reason for this is that}} La Malinche is often blamed for the downfall of the Aztec Empire, acting as a traitor to her own people.|$|E
25|$|The first pub in the Frankston area, the Cannanuke Inn, {{was located}} near the {{southeast}} corner of the intersection (on the present site of the Frankston Mechanics' Institute at 1 Plowman Place). It was built by pre-emptive Frankston settler James Davey in the mid-1840s. The first hotel <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of the intersection, the Frankston Hotel, located on its northwest corner, was licensed on 12 December 1854. The second, the Bay View Hotel, located on its northeast corner, was licensed on 15 November 1873. It was built by James Davey's grandson William Davey Jr. The third, the Prince of Wales Hotel, located on its southwest corner, was licensed on 8 December 1884. They have all been remodelled or demolished and rebuilt over the years.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Enrico Fermi High School was {{considered}} for {{the location of the}} consolidated high school. However, the facility's location <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> lot prevented further expansion without expanding onto the newly renovated fields. Furthermore, the school's contaminated soils were capped in 2007. If expansion were to occur, the town would have to incur millions of dollars in expense for the remediation of the contaminated soils on the Enrico Fermi High School location. Enfield High School's campus allowed for a sizable expansion of the building. Additionally, the town still owes a bond for the 2005 library expansion. Per the Board of Education vote on January 10, 2012 to approve Enfield High School as the location of the future consolidated high school.|$|E

25|$|There {{are very}} few archaeological sources {{contemporaneous}} with Neferefre, a fact which is now seen by Egyptologists, including Miroslav Verner, to witness a very short reign. In particular, as of 2017, only one inscription dated to his rule is known. It was left by the builders of his pyramid <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> block {{at the end of}} the corridor leading down to the pyramid substructures. The inscription was written on the fourth day of the Akhet season in the year of first occurrence of the cattle count, an event consisting of counting the livestock throughout the country to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied. It is traditionally believed that such counts occurred every two years during the Old Kingdom although recent reappraisals have led Egyptologists to posit a less regular and somewhat more frequent count. Therefore, the inscription is likely to refer to Neferefre's first or second year on the throne, and his third year at the very latest. Finally, a few artefacts dated to Neferefre's rule or shortly after have been uncovered in his mortuary complex and elsewhere in Abusir, such a clay seals bearing his Horus name.|$|E
25|$|Drake, {{winner of}} the 2015 MVC tourney at The Ralph {{returned}} for SIUE Homecoming. Though the Bulldogs took more shots, the Cougars fairly well dominated possession in the first half. In the 27th minute, Solawa scored his first goal as a Cougar, returning a blocked Jambga shot over the Drake keeper's head. Holding the 1–0 lead through halftime, SIUE came back out fired up, narrowly missing additional goals in the early second half. In the 74th minute, Drake got a breakaway, and Kendall-Moullin was sent off after making a potentially goal-saving hard tackle. The Bulldogs stepped up their attack after gaining the man-advantage. Flooding the box with bodies <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> kick, Drake evened the score at 1–1 in the 77th minute. The Cougar defense held firm into the last minute of regulation time, when a Bulldog forward piled atop Dal Santo as he covered a save, and both sides went a man down for extra time. In the 94th minute, Ebbesen and Solawa traded passes before Ebbesen hit Lachlan McLean five yards out, with the Australian sophomore turning and firing {{into the top of}} the net to complete the ninth consecutive Homecoming victory since SIUE returned to Division I.|$|E
25|$|A {{little more}} {{complicated}} {{problem is to}} find the number of non-attacking arrangements that do not change upon 90° rotation of the board. Let the board has 4n files and 4n ranks, and the number of rooks is also 4n. In this case, the rook that is on the first file can occupy any square on this file, except the corner squares (a rook cannot be <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> square because after a 90° rotation there would 2 rooks that attack each other). There are another 3 rooks that correspond to that rook and they stand, respectively, on the last rank, the last file, and the first rank (they are obtained from the first rook by 90°, 180°, and 270° rotations). Removing the files and ranks of those rooks, one obtains the rook arrangements for a (4n−4)(4n−4) board with the required symmetry. Thus, the following recurrence relation is obtained: R4n = (4n−2)R4n−4, where Rn is the number of arrangements for a n'n board. Iterating, it follows that R4n = 2n(2n−1)(2n−3)...1. The number of arrangements for a (4n+1)(4n+1) board is the same as that for a 4n4n board; this is because on a (4n+1)(4n+1) board, one rook must necessarily stand in the centre and thus the central rank and file can be removed. Therefore R4n+1 = R4n. For the traditional chessboard (n = 2), R8 = 431 = 12 possible arrangements with rotational symmetry.|$|E
