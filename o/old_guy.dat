Despite calling the Vanger family [...] "dysfunctional", Plummer {{said of the}} character: [...] "I love {{the character of the}} old man, and I sympathize with him. He's really the nicest <b>old</b> <b>guy</b> in the whole book. Everybody is a bit suspect, and still are at the end. Old Vanger has a nice straight line, and he gets his wish." [...] Plummer wanted to imbue the character with irony, an element he found to be absent from the novel's Henrik. [...] "I think that the old man would have it," [...] he opined, [...] "because he's a very sophisticated <b>old</b> <b>guy</b> [...] used to a great deal of power. So in dealing with people, he would be very good [...] he would be quite jokey, and know how to seduce them." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Dinosaur" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Kesha Sebert, in {{collaboration}} with Max Martin, Shellback; the latter two {{are responsible for the}} song's production. The song's lyrics and conception use a metaphor, comparing an older man to a prehistoric, carnivorous dinosaur. All three composers were responsible for providing the song's instruments. The song's recording was commenced at Maratone Studios, in Stockholm, Sweden, by Martin and Shellback. While being interviewed by Rolling Stone, Kesha was asked about her writing technique and how her songs come to fruition, which she explained using [...] "Dinosaur" [...] as an example. The singer explained that the song's conception was auto-biographical and that it stemmed from a previous experience she had when an older man had been hitting on her, which she elaborated on: [...] "I just write about what I live — literally, my entire record is totally autobiographical, because I think there's a great pop song in anything and everything, any situation. There's a song called 'Dinosaur' about this <b>old</b> <b>guy</b> who was hitting on me, and his toupee was kind of falling off, and I was like, 'Oh my God, you're so old, you're prehistoric, you're like a dinosaur.

500|$|Ruth {{had asked}} Yankees general manager Ed Barrow for {{permission}} to barnstorm. Barrow had no objection but warned Ruth he must obtain Landis's consent. [...] Landis biographer Spink, {{who was at the}} time the editor of The Sporting News, stated, [...] "I can say that Ruth {{knew exactly what he was}} doing when he defied Landis in October, 1921. He was willing to back his own popularity and well-known drawing powers against the Judge." [...] Ruth, to the commissioner's irritation, did not contact Landis until October 15, one day before the first exhibition. When the two spoke by telephone, Landis ordered Ruth to attend a meeting with him; Ruth refused, stating that he had to leave for Buffalo for the first game. Landis angrily refused consent for Ruth to barnstorm, and after slamming down the receiver, is recorded as saying, [...] "Who the hell does that big ape think he is? [...] That blankety-blank! [...] If he goes on that trip it will be one of the sorriest things he has ever done."

500|$|Kesha {{had been}} working on Animal for seven years prior to its release, and had written over 200 songs for the album. The {{abundance}} of material extended it from its originally planned twelve tracks to fourteen. Kesha felt that the album had an empowering, carefree message for young women. [...] "For girls, I think it's an empowering record, it's funny, it's cheeky," [...] she said. [...] "I think people need to have fun with whatever they're doing—makeup, their clothes, music, live shows—anything you don't need to take too seriously, don't take too seriously." [...] When asked how the album related to her life, Kesha explained that the album was completely autobiographical. [...] "I just write about what I live—literally, [...] I think there's a great pop song in anything and everything, any situation." [...] She cites her songs [...] "Stephen" [...] and [...] "Dinosaur" [...] as examples of this. She explained: [...] "it's about this guy I've been stalking since I was 15.

Ovechkin received 86 first-place votes while Sidney Crosby received 72 first-place votes. Henrik was also voted by his countrymen in the league to receive the Viking Award as the NHL's best Swedish player. At the NHL Awards Show the following month on 23 June, Henrik, Ovechkin and Crosby were up for both the Hart Memorial Trophy, awarded to the player deemed by the media {{to be the most}} valuable to his team, and the Ted Lindsay Award, given to the best player as voted by the NHL Players' Association (NHLPA). After losing the Ted Lindsay Award to Ovechkin, Henrik was awarded the Hart, becoming the first Canuck and second Swedish player (after Peter Forsberg in 2003) to win the trophy. Henrik garnered 894 voting points, compared to Ovechkin's 834 and Crosby's 729. He admitted afterwards to feeling like the underdog going into the awards ceremony, noting [...] " [...] are the faces of the sport ... to be standing next to them as the <b>old</b> <b>guy,</b> it's a strange feeling." [...] He was additionally named to the NHL First All-Star Team; at the same time, twin Daniel was named to the NHL Second All-Star Team. It marked the first time since Phil and Tony Esposito in 1973–74 that two brothers were named post-season NHL All-Stars.

2500|$|Scenes {{from the}} film A Clockwork Orange were filmed in Friars Square in Aylesbury but {{did not make it}} to the final cut.

The opening scene when the droogs beat up the elderly Irishman is mistakenly cited as being filmed in the underpass linking Friars Square Shopping Centre with the railway station. Although Christiane Kubrick's book Stanley Kubrick– A Life in Pictures states this the underpass in the film has a different shape to the one in Aylesbury and these sequences were actually filmed in Wandsworth. According to Malcolm McDowell: [...] "We did a sequence in Aylesbury. The town square was decorated with giant rubber ducks, weird animals, they were huge, and we accosted an <b>old</b> <b>guy</b> from the library. I ripped out these priceless books that he had and I threw them up. I remember my line, it was taken from the book, it was: 'There's a mackerel of a cornflake for you.'

[...] also added that the character is [...] "probably a coagulation of various folks". The role of Wilford was the last to be cast, and it was friend and fellow filmmaker Park Chan-Wook who suggested Harris for the role. Bong stated that Wilford needed to be played by someone with [...] "tremendous presence and performance from the first moment that he appeared in order to convince the audience", adding that [...] " [...] turned Wilford into a lively and ironic character with added appeal." [...] On taking the role of Wilford, Harris mentioned, [...] "When I was sent this script, I was told director Bong is a Korean director, and that he'd made some other films, but I had never seen any of them [...] I thought they were wonderfully accomplished films, which really made me want to work with the guy. I'm a big fan of his." [...] Harris was very praiseworthy of Bong, especially his tendency of editing the piece whilst shooting. Since the film's release, Bong has revealed background information about the character, such as Wilford being bisexual, [...] "He slept with Claude, the Egg-Head, Mason, and the pregnant teacher. Yet, his the One is the Engine." [...] Tyler John Williams portrays a young Wilford.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{some of his}} contemporaries, Jones {{stuck with}} country music with a vengeance. [...] Jones never reached the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 and almost never had any of his music played on {{mainstream}} popular music stations in his career. Ironically, without even trying, Jones' unabashed loyalty to strictly country arrangements attracted the admiration of musicians and songwriters {{from a wide range}} of genres. [...] In an often-quoted tribute, Frank Sinatra called Jones [...] "the second best singer in America". [...] In a Rolling Stone interview in 1969, Bob Dylan was asked what he thought was the best song released in the previous year and he replied, [...] "George Jones had one called 'Small Town Laboring Man'," [...] and in his autobiography Chronicles, Dylan states that in the early 1960s he was largely unimpressed by what he heard on the radio and admits [...] "Outside of maybe George Jones, I didn't listen to country music either." [...] Country rock pioneer Gram Parsons was an avid George Jones fan and covered Jones' song [...] "That's All It Took" [...] on his first solo album. [...] In the documentary Gram Parsons: Fallen Angel, Pamela des Barres recalls seeing Parsons singing Jones' song [...] "She Once Lived Here" [...] at an empty Whiskey A Go Go in Los Angeles: [...] "It was my peak, peak moment, not sitting on Jimmy Page's amp...that was my peak moment." [...] Parsons reignited Keith Richards' interest in country music in the early seventies and after Jones' death in 2013 the guitarist wrote, [...] "He possessed the most touching voice, the most expressive ways of projecting that beautiful instrument of anyone I can call to mind. [...] You heard his heart in every note he sang." [...] Richards recorded [...] "Say It's Not You" [...] with Jones for The Bradley Barn Sessions in 1994 and recalls in his autobiography hearing him sing for the first time when the Rolling Stones and Jones were on the same show in Texas in 1964: [...] "They trailed in with tumbleweed following them, as if tumbleweed was their pet. [...] Dust all over the place, a bunch of cowboys. But when George got up, we went whoa, there's a master up there." [...] In the documentary The History of Rock 'N' Roll, Mick Jagger also cites Jones as one of his favorite country singers. [...] John Prine mentions Jones in his song [...] "Jesus the Missing Years". [...] Jones fan Elvis Costello had a surprise hit in the UK when he covered [...] "A Good Year For The Roses" [...] in 1981. [...] Elliott Smith told an interviewer about his idea of Heaven: [...] "George Jones would be singing all the time. [...] It would be like New York in reverse: people would be nice to each other for no reason at all, and it would smell good." [...] In a 2001 interview with Mark Binelli from Rolling Stone, Leonard Cohen asked, [...] "Have you heard George Jones' last record Cold Hard Truth? [...] I love to hear an <b>old</b> <b>guy</b> lay out his situation. [...] He has the best voice in America," [...] and the day Jones died, Cohen performed [...] "Choices" [...] on stage in Winnipeg, Canada as a tribute to the country legend. [...] In 2013, Robbie Robertson told Uncut, [...] "He was the Ray Charles of country music - the one who could make you cry with his voice...We wouldn't listen to country music, the guys in The Band, but we'd listen to George Jones..." [...] Robert Plant told Uncuts Michael Bonner in 2014, [...] "I now have to listen to George Jones once a day. [...] Amazing singer. [...] What a singer." [...] James Taylor, who wrote [...] "Bartender's Blues" [...] with Jones in mind and sang background vocals with him on the recording, told Rolling Stone, [...] "He sounds like a steel guitar. [...] It's the way he blends notes, the way he comes up to them, the way he crescendos and decrescendos. [...] The dynamic of it is very tight and very controlled - it's like carving with the voice." [...] Other disparate artists who recorded with Jones include Dennis Locorriere and Ray Sawyer of Dr. Hook, Mark Knopfler, the Staples Singers, Leon Russell, B.B King, Blackberry Smoke and Linda Ronstadt. [...] In 1995, Burt Reynolds wrote, [...] "He is to country music what Spencer Tracy is to movies." ...|$|E
