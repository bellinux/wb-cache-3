5|$|Archaeologists {{have found}} {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>prehistoric</b> {{use of the}} Fossil Creek watershed, {{and it is possible}} that people lived here as long as 10,000 years ago. More recently, Yavapai and Apache peoples have lived in the area, also used by 19th-century cattlemen and shepherds.|$|E
5|$|Bronze Age barrows at Selworthy Beacon and an Iron Age {{enclosure}} at Furzebury Brake, west of {{the town}} show evidence <b>of</b> <b>prehistoric</b> occupation of the area, although there is also possible evidence in the intertidal area, where {{the remains of a}} submerged forest still exist.|$|E
5|$|Feral {{horses are}} born {{and live in}} the wild, but are descended from domesticated animals. Many populations of feral horses exist {{throughout}} the world.

5|$|Osbert Guy Stanhope Crawford (28 October 1886– 28 November 1957), {{better known}} as O. G. S. Crawford, was a British {{archaeologist}} who specialised in the study <b>of</b> <b>prehistoric</b> Britain and the archaeology of Sudan.

5|$|Styracosaurus {{is known}} from the Dinosaur Park Formation, {{and was a member}} of a diverse and {{well-documented}} fauna <b>of</b> <b>prehistoric</b> animals that included horned relatives such as Centrosaurus and Chasmosaurus, duckbills such as Prosaurolophus, Lambeosaurus, Gryposaurus, Corythosaurus, and Parasaurolophus, tyrannosaurids Gorgosaurus, Daspletosaurus, and armored Edmontonia and Euoplocephalus.|$|E
5|$|The first {{structural}} relic <b>of</b> <b>prehistoric</b> man was excavated in 1973 at Cefn Glas {{near the}} watershed of the Rhondda Fach river.

5|$|The {{history of}} breath-hold diving goes {{back at least}} to {{classical}} times, and there is evidence <b>of</b> <b>prehistoric</b> hunting and gathering of seafoods that may have involved underwater swimming. Technical advances allowing the provision of breathing gas to a diver underwater at ambient pressure are recent, and self-contained breathing systems developed at an accelerated rate following the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very little}} {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>prehistoric</b> activity in the area, especially pre-Iron Age; however, Celtic names {{in the area around}} Wigan—such as Bryn, Makerfield and Ince—indicate that the Celtic people of Britain were active in the area in the Iron Age. The first people believed to have settled in the Wigan area were the Brigantes, a Celtic tribe who controlled most of northern Britain.|$|E
5|$|When {{part of the}} {{foundations}} for the complex were dug in 1977, an archaeological investigation uncovered prehistoric artifacts, as is typical during construction in Tenri.

5|$|Almost all of Manila sits on top {{of centuries}} <b>of</b> <b>prehistoric</b> {{alluvial}} deposits built by {{the waters of the}} Pasig River and on some land reclaimed from Manila Bay. Manila's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since the American colonial times. Some of the city's natural variations in topography have been evened out. , Manila had a total area of 42.88 square kilometers.|$|E
5|$|Evidence <b>of</b> <b>prehistoric</b> human {{occupation}} {{in the parish}} exists {{in the form of}} 30 round barrows, about half of which are sited over chalk and half over Reading Beds. Many of the barrows have been damaged by more recent activities. The remains of strip lynchets of 'Celtic' fields have been found near a few of the barrows. One of the three 'Rainbarrows' on Duddle Heath has been excavated; bucket urns containing cremations from the site were taken to the Dorset County Museum.|$|E
5|$|From an {{analysis}} of coastal deposits near Bundala in the Hambantota district in Sri Lanka, paleontologists have gathered secure evidence <b>of</b> <b>prehistoric</b> fauna in Sri Lanka by 125,000 BP. Excavations of the area have also yielded tools of quartz and chert probably belonging to the Middle Palaeolithic period. Consequently, some believe in {{the possibility that there}} were prehistoric humans in Sri Lanka from 500,000 BP or earlier, and consider it likely that they were on the island by 300,000 BP. Further analysis of ancient coastal sands in the north and south east of the island may yield evidence of such early hominids.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} fourth {{millennium}} BC the track was built between an island at Westhay and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick {{close to the}} River Brue. A group of mounds at Westhay mark the site <b>of</b> <b>prehistoric</b> lake dwellings, which were {{likely to have been}} similar to those found in the Iron Age Glastonbury Lake Village near Godney, itself built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, rubble, and clay.|$|E
5|$|Many {{meanings}} {{have been}} suggested for the advent and nature <b>of</b> <b>prehistoric</b> art. It may have helped develop human solidarity in its early stages. Open air rock art may have acted as signposts for the route of animal migrations. Cave art {{may have had a}} ritual role in rites of initiation, vision quests or totemic ceremonies. Portable objects may have acted as notation systems and anthropomorphic figures may have had a role in religious rituals. However, most artifacts can only be understood in their context, which is often lost or poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|Prehistoric art in Scotland is {{visual art}} created or {{found within the}} modern borders of Scotland, before the {{departure}} of the Romans from southern and central Britain in the early fifth century CE, which is usually seen as the beginning of the early historic or Medieval era.

40|$|Humans have {{inhabited}} the Yellowstone Lake area {{for at least}} the past 10, 000 years. Archeological studies of the area are starting to provide a view <b>of</b> the <b>prehistoric</b> lifeways <b>of</b> these peoples. This paper summarizes the nature <b>of</b> this <b>prehistoric</b> use, including lithic raw material utilization, stone tool characterization, and food procurement practices. Changes in landform evolution during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene and their potential impact on prehistoric groups occupying the area are also discussed. Finally, the question of change versus stability is discussed in light <b>of</b> the <b>prehistoric</b> occupation <b>of</b> the area...|$|R

5|$|Sitakunda {{has been}} {{occupied}} by humans since the Neolithic era; tools {{associated with the}} prehistoric Assam group have been found throughout the area. In 1886, shouldered celts manufactured from petrified wood were discovered, as reported by Indian archaeologist Rakhaldas Bandyopadhyay in his book Banglar Itihas, or History of Bengal, (volume I, 1914). In 1917, British mineralogist Dr. J. Coggin Brown uncovered more prehistoric celts. Large quantities of pebbles have also been found, but archaeologists have not determined whether they {{were used in the}} construction <b>of</b> <b>prehistoric</b> tools.|$|E
5|$|The Hebrides were {{originally}} {{settled in the}} Mesolithic era and have a diversity <b>of</b> <b>prehistoric</b> sites. A flint arrowhead found in a field near Bridgend, Islay has been dated to 10,800BC. This find may indicate {{the presence of a}} summer hunting party rather than permanent settlement. Burnt hazelnut shells and microscopic charcoal found at Farm Fields, Kinloch on Rùm indicate a settlement of some kind and this is amongst the oldest evidence of occupation in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The {{archaeologist}} Leslie Grinsell {{reported that}} in the mid-1970s, he learned of a folk tale that the stones had once been children who were turned to stones as punishment for playing Five-Stones on a Sunday. This folk motif of humans turned to stone for revelling on a Sunday had been attached to a range <b>of</b> <b>prehistoric</b> monuments across south-western Britain by the early eighteenth century, although it had been first recorded in Cornwall in 1602. It is likely connected to Sabbatarianism, {{and may have been}} spread by Protestant preachers.|$|E
