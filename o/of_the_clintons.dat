5|$|On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven {{employees}} of the White House Travel Office, causing the White House travel office controversy even though the travel office staff served {{at the pleasure of}} the president and could be dismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation. Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clintons</b> to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.|$|E
500|$|Bill Clinton later {{described}} the allegations and investigation as [...] "a fraud", while in her 2003autobiography Hillary Clinton gave short shrift to the matter, never mentioning Billy Dale {{by name and}} saying that [...] "'Travelgate'... was perhaps worthy of a two- or three-week life span; instead, in a partisan political climate, it became the first manifestation of an obsession for investigation that persisted into the next millennium." [...] Many in the Clinton inner circle would always believe that political motivations had been behind the investigation, including an attempt to derail Hillary Clinton's role in the 1993 health care reform plan. [...] But associate White House counsel William Kennedy would also later reflect that {{some of it was}} just [...] "pure palpable hatred <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clintons.</b> It started and it never quit." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 2, 1993, the White House {{issued its}} own 80-page {{report on the}} firings, one that the New York Times termed [...] "strikingly self-critical". [...] Co-written by Chief of Staff McLarty, it criticized five White House officials, {{included}} McLarty himself, Watkins, Kennedy, Cornelius, and another, for dismissing the Travel Office members improperly, for appearing to pressure the FBI into its involvement, and for allowing friends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clintons</b> {{to become involved in}} a matter with which they had a business stake. [...] It said that the employees should instead have been placed on administrative leave. [...] However, the White House said no illegal actions had occurred, and no officials would be terminated; this did not satisfy Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, who called for an independent investigation. [...] As Chief of Staff McLarty personally apologized to the fired Travel Office employees — some of whom had all their personal documents and travel photographs related to years of service thrown out during the firing process — and said they would be given other jobs (which five of them were; Dale and his assistant director retired.) [...] The White House report also contained the initial indications of the First Lady's involvement in the firings, saying that she had taken an interest in the Travel Office's alleged mismanagement and had been informed two days in advance that the firings would take place. [...] There was no indication of involvement from President Clinton himself, although he had earlier taken broad public responsibility for what had happened.|$|E

2500|$|Friends {{and colleagues}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clintons</b> have said Whitehaven has {{typically}} been {{reserved for the}} exclusive use of Hillary Clinton and invitations to visit the property are considered a high privilege reserved for close confidantes.

2500|$|Pilkington also {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "an unrestrained attack on the former president and first lady." [...] Pilkington notes {{that several of the}} claims in the book have been proven factually false. According to Pilkington, Schweizer does not prove corruption on the part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clintons,</b> but [...] "one of his main contentions – that the former president’s rates skyrocketed after his wife became secretary of state – is correct... pointing to several glaring conflicts of interest." ...|$|E

2500|$|Burton said, in 1998 of Bill Clinton, [...] "If I {{could prove}} 10 {{percent of what}} I believe {{happened}} , he'd be gone. This guy's a scumbag. That's why I'm after him." [...] Burton led the House inquiry into the death of Vince Foster, who he believed was murdered and urged extensive investigation into the possible involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clintons.</b> Burton gained attention for re-enacting the alleged crime in his backyard with his own pistol and a watermelon standing in for Foster's head. After hearings into Democratic fundraising (see section below) began, a Democratic National Committee staffer appeared in a pumpkin suit with a button that read, [...] "Don't shoot." [...] Burton's information during the Whitewater controversy was based on opposition research conducted by Floyd Brown, who founded Citizens United in 1988. Due to problems {{with the quality of}} Brown's research and testimony, the investigation was closed.|$|E
60|$|No {{question}} as to which <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clintons</b> is the legitimate son of the captain and his wife has ever again troubled them.

What is much more important to them both, neither of them can say which has the first claim on the love and affection of Captain and Mrs. Clinton, and of their sister.|$|E
6000|$|The {{outer wall}} of this splendid and {{gigantic}} structure enclosed seven acres, {{a part of}} which was occupied by extensive stables, and by a pleasure garden, with its trim arbours and parterres, and the rest formed the large base-court or outer yard of the noble Castle. The lordly structure itself, which rose near the centre of this spacious enclosure, was composed of a huge pile of magnificent castellated buildings, apparently of different ages, surrounding an inner court, and bearing in the names attached to each portion of the magnificent mass, and in the armorial bearings which were there blazoned, the emblems of mighty chiefs who had long passed away, and whose history, could Ambition have lent ear to it, might have read a lesson to the haughty favourite who had now acquired and was augmenting the fair domain. A large and massive Keep, which formed the citadel of the Castle, was of uncertain though great antiquity. It bore the name of Caesar, perhaps from its resemblance {{to that in the}} Tower of London so called. Some antiquaries ascribe its foundation to the time of Kenelph, from whom the Castle had its name, a Saxon King of Mercia, and others to an early era after the Norman Conquest. On the exterior walls frowned the scutcheon <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clintons,</b> by whom they were founded in the reign of Henry I.; and of the yet more redoubted Simon de Montfort, by whom, during the Barons' wars, Kenilworth was long held out against Henry III. Here Mortimer, Earl of March, famous alike for his rise and his fall, had once gaily revelled in Kenilworth, while his dethroned sovereign, Edward II., languished in its dungeons. Old John of Gaunt, [...] "time-honoured Lancaster," [...] had widely extended the Castle, erecting that noble and massive pile which yet bears the name of Lancaster's Buildings; and Leicester himself had outdone the former possessors, princely and powerful as they were, by erecting another immense structure, which now lies crushed under its own ruins, the monument of its owner's ambition. The external wall of this royal Castle was, on the south and west sides, adorned and defended by a lake partly artificial, across which Leicester had constructed a stately bridge, that Elizabeth might enter the Castle by a path hitherto untrodden, instead of the usual entrance to the northward, over which he had erected a gatehouse or barbican, which still exists, and is equal in extent, and superior in architecture, to the baronial castle of many a northern chief.|$|E
