5|$|Sunset Overdrive is an action-adventure game {{set in a}} third-person perspective. Players {{navigate}} a metropolis called Sunset City in {{the year}} 2027. This dystopian world has been overrun by mutants called the OD, short for <b>Overcharge</b> Drinkers. The player character is a former FizzCo employee, tasked with cleaning up the mess left behind from a party FizzCo had thrown to celebrate the launch of its new energy drink, <b>Overcharge</b> Delirium XT.|$|E
5|$|GM {{recommends}} that a Volt battery fire be fought with water rather than dry chemicals, and rates the Volt battery as having no explosion or electrocution hazard {{as the result}} of a collision. The high-voltage system is designed to shut down automatically in the event of an airbag deployment, and to detect a loss of communication from an airbag control module. During the Volt development the lithium-ion battery pack was subjected to a wide range of tests, including <b>overcharge,</b> discharge, vibration, excessive heat and cold, short circuit, humidity, fire, crush, water immersion, salt water immersion, and nail penetration.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an eight-player co-operative multiplayer mode called the Chaos Squad, which tasks players {{to complete a}} series of missions, as decided by the players themselves. Players defend vats of <b>Overcharge</b> Delirium XT from waves of OD'd at night and stop their progression by setting up fortifications and barriers, {{in a manner similar}} to tower defense games. It is inter-connected with the single-player mode allowing players to transfer their story character, with all the weapons and gadgets they have already accumulated, to the mode. Although players work together, players also try to earn more Style points during play than their co-op partners.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} <b>overcharging</b> spherically-symmetric black holes in spacetime dimensions $D > 4 $ by the capture of a charged particle. We generalize Wald's classic result that extremal black holes cannot be <b>overcharged.</b> For nearly extremal black holes, we also generalize Hubeny's scenario by showing that <b>overcharging</b> is possible in a small region of parameter space. We check how $D$ affects the <b>overcharging</b> parameter space, and find that <b>overcharging</b> becomes increasingly difficult for nearly-extremal black holes in the large-$D$ limit.

5|$|Sunset Overdrive {{is an open}} world third-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by Insomniac Games and published by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox One. It was announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013, and released worldwide in October 2014. The game is set in 2027, in a fictional metropolis called Sunset City. The player controls an employee of FizzCo, who has to fight off the OD, short for <b>Overcharge</b> Drinkers: humans who have turned into mutants after drinking FizzCo's energy drink beverage. In the dystopian Sunset City the player character can wall-run, use zip-lines, and grind rails to swiftly navigate through it, with a large arsenal of weapons to use. The game also has a cooperative multiplayer mode called Chaos Squad, which tasks players to complete a series of missions with seven players. As the game puts emphasis on momentum, the game does not feature any cover system.|$|E

50|$|Although {{theoretically}} <b>overcharging</b> is impermissible, {{courts are}} reluctant to dismiss charges that are supported by probable cause. American Bar Association guidelines discourage <b>overcharging,</b> but do not prohibit it.

25|$|Although Kant never {{explicitly}} states {{what the}} first proposition is, {{it is clear that}} its content is suggested by the following common-sense observation. Common sense distinguishes among: (a) the case in which a person clearly acts contrary to duty; (b) the case in which a person’s actions coincide with duty, but are not motivated by duty; and (c) the case in which a person's actions coincide with duty because she is motivated by duty. Kant illustrates the distinction between (b) and (c) with the example of a shopkeeper (4:397) who chooses not to <b>overcharge</b> an inexperienced customer in order to preserve his business’s reputation. Because it is not motivated by duty, the shopkeeper's action has no moral worth. Kant contrasts the shopkeeper with the case of a person who, faced with “adversity and hopeless grief” (4:398) obeys his duty to preserve his life. Because this person acts from duty, his actions have moral worth. Kant thinks our actions only have moral worth and deserve esteem when they are motivated by duty.|$|E
500|$|On July 13, 2027, FizzCo {{releases}} its {{new energy}} drink, <b>OverCharge</b> Delirium XT (also known as OCD), exclusively in Sunset City. In {{an attempt to}} sell OCD faster, FizzCo skipped health regulation protocols, in turn causing anyone who drinks it {{to turn into a}} violent boil-bodied mutant known as an <b>Overcharge</b> Drinker (OD). In order to cover up the deception, FizzCo claims that a virus has broken out and quarantines the whole city, preventing anyone from entering or exiting. The player, a FizzCo employee who works in the sanitation division, is saved from an attacking OD by Walter, a fellow survivor; the player is unaffected by the drink, as they were not allowed to attend the launch party for OCD, later referred to as [...] "Horror Night".|$|E
500|$|After all, {{the carpet}} {{was only one}} of a number of disputed items, and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things, but in whether Carte could be trusted with the {{financial}} affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, but it does seem fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May 1891, a year after the end of the [...] "Quarrel", that Carte had admitted [...] "an unintentional <b>overcharge</b> of nearly £1,000 in the electric lighting accounts alone." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Overcharging,</b> in law, {{refers to}} a prosecutorial {{practice}} that involves [...] "tacking on" [...] additional charges that the prosecutor knows he cannot prove. It is used to put the prosecutor in a better plea bargaining position. [...] The term has been defined in different ways. Alschuler writes that [...] "to prosecutors, <b>overcharging</b> is accusing the defendant of a crime {{of which he is}} clearly innocent to induce a plea to the 'proper' crime. Defense counsel identify two types of <b>overcharging.</b> 'Horizontal' <b>overcharging</b> is the unreasonable multiplying of accusations against a single defendant. He may be either charged with a separate offense for every technical criminal transaction in which he participated, or the prosecutor may fragment a single criminal transaction into numerous component offenses. 'Vertical' <b>overcharging</b> is charging a single offense at a higher level than the circumstances of the case seem to warrant." [...] Vertical <b>overcharging</b> is deemed to be the more abusive of the two practices. In defense of <b>overcharging,</b> {{it has been argued that}} in order to obtain a plea bargain that results in a lower sentence than the prosecutor's original position, while still obtaining a penalty that promotes public safety, the prosecutor must select an initial charge higher than is penologically appropriate.|$|R

2500|$|While not {{receiving}} {{the same level}} of media attention as assessments on real property, controversial property-related fees and charges became a significant problem following the passage of Proposition 13, as many local governments labeled taxes as “fees” or “charges” and imposed them without voter approval. [...] For example, the California Supreme Court ruled that a local municipal utility, such as a city providing water service, is entitled to a reasonable “return on investment” (otherwise known as “profit”). [...] This meant that a local municipal utility could legally <b>overcharge</b> its customers in excess of the cost of providing the utility service, and then transfer the excess cost revenues to the general fund of the local agency to be spent at the discretion of local politicians. [...] All this could generally be done without voter approval.|$|E
2500|$|Proposition 218 issues {{arise when}} a local agency seeks to finance {{lifeline}} utility rate programs by increasing utility {{fees and charges}} on other ratepayers without voter approval. [...] Local agencies would like to legally <b>overcharge</b> ratepayers to pay for lifeline utility rate programs because no voter approval would be required and because it would free up existing local agency funds that could be spent on other purposes. [...] However, since property-related fees and charges are limited {{to the cost of}} providing the service to each parcel of property, Proposition 218 prohibits local agencies from overcharging utility customers for property-related services such as water, sewer, and refuse collection to pay for lifeline utility rate programs. [...] The legal reasoning is similar to the reasoning applied to tiered water rates and the cost of service limitations under Proposition 218.|$|E

40|$|Mean-field {{theory is}} used to model {{polyelectrolyte}} adsorption {{and the possibility of}} overcompensation of charged surfaces. For charged surfaces that are also chemically attractive, the <b>overcharging</b> is large in high salt conditions, amounting to 20 - 40 % of the bare surface charge. However, full charge inversion is not obtained in thermodynamical equilibrium for physical values of the parameters. The <b>overcharging</b> increases with addition of salt, but does not have a simple scaling form with the bare surface charge. Our results indicate that more evolved explanation is needed in order to understand polyelectrolyte multilayer built-up. For strong polymer-repulsive surfaces, we derive simple scaling laws for the polyelectrolyte adsorption and <b>overcharging.</b> We show that the <b>overcharging</b> scales linearly with the bare surface charge, but its magnitude is very small in comparison to the surface charge. In contrast with the attractive surface, here the <b>overcharging</b> is found to decrease substantially with addition of salt. In the intermediate range of weak repulsive surfaces, the behavior with addition of salt crosses over from increasing <b>overcharging</b> (at low ionic strength) to decreasing one (at high ionic strength). Our results for all types of surfaces are supported by full numerical solutions of the mean-field equations. Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures, final version. to be published in PR...|$|R
40|$|Based on unique data characterizing private cartel {{behavior}} {{since the}} 1770 s, this dissertation presents an empirical analysis of four measures of success of overt collusive conduct: <b>overcharges,</b> stability, duration, and a multidimensional index of cartel success. Factors hypothesized {{to contribute to}} success include market structure, internal organization, and legal environment. The results of this research make important contributions to cartel studies and the design of antitrust policies. ^ Empirical findings suggest that markets characterized by {{a high degree of}} seller concentration provide a more favorable environment for cartel success than less concentrated markets. <b>Overcharges</b> attained in concentrated markets are higher, and cartels are more stable. The firms 2 ̆ 7 size inequality within the cartel is negatively related to cartel success. ^ There is mixed evidence about the impact of changes in the antirust law environment on cartel success. First, antitrust enforcement appears to be directed at cartels that attain lower <b>overcharges</b> rather than cartels that achieve higher <b>overcharges.</b> Second, stricter antitrust regulations tend to target cartel <b>overcharges</b> to a higher extent than they target cartel duration. Although cartel <b>overcharges</b> tend to decline over time, the duration of cartel agreements tends to increase over time. The multidimensional index of cartel success tends to increase over time, suggesting that cartels have become more successful as antitrust laws become stricter. However, there is also evidence that antitrust enforcement since 1990 has been the most effective. The <b>overcharges</b> are the lowest during this period. ^ This research shows that <b>overcharges</b> tend to be lower in the countries with the most mature antitrust systems. Empirical findings suggest that current antitrust policy presumptions about the average gain from price-fixing are likely to be too low. Therefore, fines calculated based on these presumptions typically result in sub-optimal deterrence. ...|$|R
