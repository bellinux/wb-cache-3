50|$|Nearly half {{a century}} ago, Edith Penrose (1959) pointed out that {{superior}} profitability (e.g. <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>sales</b> <b>or</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> assets) was neither interesting to investors - who value the prospect of increasing future cash flows - nor sustainable over time. Profitability is not entirely unimportant - it does after all provide the investment in new resources to enable growth to occur. More recently, Rugman and Verbeke (2002) have reviewed {{the implications of this}} observation for research in strategy. Richard Rumelt (2007) has again raised the importance of making progress with the issue of strategy dynamics, describing it as still ‘the next frontier … underresearched, underwritten about, and underunderstood’.|$|R
25|$|Some {{businesses}} {{maximize their}} profit margins through vertical integration; book publishing {{is not one}} of them. Although newspaper and magazine companies still often own printing presses and binderies, book publishers rarely do. Similarly, the trade usually sells the finished products through a distributor who stores and distributes the publisher's wares for a percentage fee <b>or</b> sells <b>on</b> a <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> <b>return</b> basis.|$|R
50|$|Some {{accessories}} {{may actually}} be consumables, for example a tool rental company might include dust masks and sanding belts with the rental of a Floor Sander. In this case, the consumables may be billed upfront as a normal retail product, or may be supplied <b>on</b> a <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> <b>return</b> basis where the rental company will charge based on the unused product returned {{at the end of}} the rental period.|$|R
5000|$|The first V-type engine, a 2-cylinder vee twin, {{was built}} in 1889 by Daimler, to a design by Wilhelm Maybach. By 1903 V8 engines were being {{produced}} for motor boat racing by the Société Antoinette to designs by Léon Levavasseur, building on experience gained with in-line four-cylinder engines. In 1904, the Putney Motor Works completed a new V12, 150bhp 18.4 litre engine - the first V12 engine produced for any purpose. This one was manufactured for two Russian brothers making a dirigible. They {{ran out of money}} and Commander May bought it <b>on</b> a <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> <b>return</b> basis for Motor boat racing, having some moderate success in 1908. The engine was exposed and the hot coil ignition created misfiring on becoming wet with the spray. Sir Robert Bosch supplied the very first magnetos and the problem was solved.|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{examined}} the relationship between gender diversity on the board and firm performance for developed countries, but similar efforts for developing countries are rare. Employing a panel of over 1, 000 listed firms for a period from 1999 to 2007, this study assesses the impact of women directors on the performance of listed firms in China. Our main results suggest that: 1) The percent of women directors has a positive impact on firm performance as measured by <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>sales</b> (ROS) <b>or</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> assets (ROA), 2) The number of women directors matters: A board with three or more women directors has a much stronger impact on firm performance than a board with one or two women directors, 3) The positive impact of women directors on firm performance is significant among firms controlled by legal person owners but not significant among firms controlled by state owners. This result corroborates the view that legal person owners tend to monitor the listed firms in China more effectively than state owners (Chen, Firth, Gao and Rui, 2006, Sun and Tong, 2003). In sum, this study indicates that in China, women directors {{have a positive impact on}} firm performance, contingent on the ownership structure of listed firms...|$|R
40|$|APICA (Association pour la Promotion des Initiatives Communautaires Africaines) is an {{organization}} that supports home-grown development activities or Local Development Initiatives - LDls. This support is offered through national and international NGOs and technical services which are known as LDI Support Bodies - LDISB. APICA seeks to improve the support LDISBs give to LDIs, {{with which they are}} involved, by helping to resolve their technical, leadership, funding and administrative problems. Apart from training-related activities, APICA also carries out research and studies on development issues, and, in the technological field, develops equipment prototypes. In the field of information and exchange, APICA has two main instruments: - the magazine African Communities, which comes out three times a year. This is an essential means of communication for APICA, containing as it does sections on development activities; technologies; job creation schemes; health issues past and present; recipes; and practical hints. APICA's priority now is to make sure this interesting magazine gets distributed in rural areas. - the Douala Documentation Centre in Cameroon, which could be called a sort of 'information processing plant', turning theoretical knowledge into practical help for potential users. Many books are registered there, and the Centre acquires new ones each year for the 'bookshop' and prepares the files called 'experience storage rooms', which are records on how certain experiments or projects were carried out. The Documentation Service, whose mission is to disseminate information, replies to questions, receives visitors, and arranges the <b>sale</b> of books <b>on</b> a <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> <b>return</b> basis in various regions of Cameroon. One of the Centre's current activities is research on the use of national languages in extension work for development.
