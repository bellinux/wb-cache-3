30|$|We {{compare the}} {{amplitude}} decay curve that is predicted for Sakurajima {{with the actual}} data we obtained in the first <b>operation</b> <b>test.</b> As the decay curve in Figure  10 is obtained from the FM operation from 10 to 20  Hz at the Toyohashi site, and the data in the first <b>operation</b> <b>test</b> in Sakurajima are obtained by the FM operation from 10 to 15  Hz and a single frequency of 10.01  Hz, we need to convert their amplitudes {{to be able to}} compare them with each other. Therefore, we convert the amplitude decay curve that is predicted for FM operation of 10 to 20  Hz into the decay curve for FM operation of 10 to 15  Hz. We also convert the amplitude of the single frequency of 10.01  Hz to the mean spectral amplitude of FM operation of 10 to 15  Hz.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{extended}} <b>operation</b> <b>testing</b> and data analysis of free-piston Stirling convertors at the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC). Extended <b>operation</b> <b>testing</b> {{is essential to}} the development of radioisotope power systems and their potential use for long duration missions. To document the reliability of the convertors, regular monitoring and analysis of the extended operation data is particularly valuable; allowing us to better understand and quantity the long life characteristics of the convertors. Further, investigation and comparison of the extended operation data to baseline performance data provides us an opportunity for understanding system behavior should any off-nominal performance occur. GRC currently has 14 Stirling convertors under 24 -hour unattended extended <b>operation</b> <b>testing,</b> including two operating the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator Engineering Unit (ASRG-EU). 10 of the 14 Stirling convertors at GRC are the Advanced Stirling Convertors (ASC) developed by Sunpower, Incorporated. These are highly efficient (up to > 33. 5 % conversion efficiency), low mass convertors that have evolved through technologically progressive convertor builds. The remaining four convertors at GRC are Technology Demonstration Convertors (TDC) from Infinia Corporation. They have achieved> 27 % conversion efficiency and have accumulated over 178, 000 of the total 250, 622 hours of extended operation currently at GRC. A synopsis of the Stirling convertor extended <b>operation</b> <b>testing</b> and data analysis at NASA GRC is presented in this paper, as well as how this testing has contributed to the Stirling convertor's progression toward flight...|$|R
