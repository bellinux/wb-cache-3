5|$|Brian {{realizes that}} if no <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> {{about the lives}} of animals, then he is {{worthless}} to the Griffin family and everyone else. Stewie finds Brian crying in the bathtub, and, seeing how upset Brian is and feeling sorry for him, Stewie successfully fakes his death by putting his collar (which Brian hadn't been wearing) on a stray and killing it in a liquor store fire. The Griffins are devastated upon learning about Brian's supposed death, and realize how close a friend he was to them. Seeing this, Stewie rushes upstairs to show Brian how much the Griffins still care about him, regardless of his species. Brian then realizes his life does have a purpose and thanks Stewie for helping him, and decides to remain hidden to let the Griffins grieve a little longer.|$|E
5|$|In The Simpsons twentieth {{episode of}} the twentieth season, Four Great Women and a Manicure is loosely based on Macbeth. In the third act of the episode, Marge embodies Lady Macbeth, an ambitious wife who is {{frustrated}} by everything around her. She not only has to clean the costumes worn by other actors, but is also frustrated {{over the fact that}} Homer doesn't have any interest in auditioning for lead roles and would rather play a tree. She convinces him to kill Sideshow Mel and he does to assume the lead role of Macbeth. When Marge learns that no <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> for Homer's lack of acting skills over Hibbert's and those with no lines, she forces him to kill off everyone else until he's the only actor left. The angry spirits visit her that night and she tries to pin the blame on Homer. They refuse to believe Marge by pointing out that they knew he was a victim in her devious plans and get their revenge on her by killing her in a fright induced heart attack. Even though Homer gives Marge's ghost a promising performance, he eventually frustrates her more by killing himself so he doesn't have to audition for more Shakespearean plays. This forces Marge to learn her lesson the hard way when she must spend eternity with a lazy and happy Homer.|$|E

For example, if a set of vertical lines is presented to one eye, and a set of horizontal lines to the same region of the retina of the other, sometimes the vertical lines are seen with no trace of the horizontal lines, and sometimes the horizontal lines are seen with no trace of the vertical lines.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{a shared}} {{belief in the}} {{potential}} of IoT, industry leaders and consumers are facing barriers to adopt IoT technology more widely. Mike Farley argued in Forbes that many IoT solutions either lack interoperability or a clear use case for end-users. “Instead of convincing consumers that they need complex systems to serve needs they don’t have, we should fix real problems people struggle with every day.” Many gadgets in the consumer IoT space have appealed to early adopters, yet failed to demonstrate relevance to ordinary people’s lives. “In order to boost sales and drive demand beyond the early adopter set, {{we need to stop}} making toys no <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> about and instead work on building simple solutions to real, everyday problems for real people.” A recent study by Ericsson regarding the adoption of IoT among Danish companies, has suggested that many are struggling “to pinpoint exactly where the value of IoT lies for them”. A company must identify where the value of IoT lies in order to capture it, otherwise non-action is the consequence. This indicates that a major roadblock to IoT adoption is not technical but analytical in nature.|$|E

Gekko also bumps into Bud Fox, and they discuss their shared experience going to jail. Gekko follows Winnie outside, where she explains why she blames him for everything that went wrong, stemming from his affairs and her brother Rudy's suicide. Gekko claims he worked, from prison, to get the best therapists and even paid off a drug dealer to stop selling to Rudy, who died from an overdose. Winnie forgives him.|$|E
500|$|Some {{prominent}} critics wrote negative reviews. In his 1941 {{review for}} Sur, Jorge Luis Borges famously called the film [...] "a labyrinth with no center" [...] and predicted that its legacy {{would be a}} film [...] "whose historical value is undeniable but which no <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> to see again." [...] The Argus Weekend Magazine critic Erle Cox called the film [...] "amazing" [...] but thought that Welles's break with Hollywood traditions was [...] "overdone." [...] Tatlers James Agate called it [...] "the well-intentioned, muddled, amateurish thing one expects from high-brows" [...] and [...] "a quite good film which tries to run the psychological essay in harness with your detective thriller, and doesn't quite succeed." [...] Eileen Creelman of The New York Sun called it [...] "a cold picture, unemotional, a puzzle rather than a drama". Other people who disliked the film were W. H. Auden and James Agee.|$|E
500|$|After much anticipation, Brian {{receives}} {{an invitation to}} an award ceremony celebrating his novel, Faster Than the Speed of Love, [...] by the Rhode Island Society for Special Literary Excellence. Convinced {{he is a great}} writer, Brian attempts to gain the family's interest but fails to do so. Once he arrives at the [...] "award ceremony" [...] however, he discovers that he has misunderstood {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "special", [...] prompting him to drown his sorrows at the local bar and realize that he's not a writer at all, but a big fat joke. He drives home drunk that night and accidentally runs over and kills a dog. He secretly buries the dead dog's body outside the Griffins' home and tries to keep quiet about it. Stewie, having witnessed his deed, begins to toy with Brian's guilt, eventually driving him to a state where he decides to confess to [...] "murder". However, when he confesses to Joe and the Griffin family, they all laugh, saying that no <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> if a dog or any other animal is killed, especially by another animal.|$|E

[...] Zach Boren said, [...] "Everyone in the whole family is an Ohio State fan now[...] [...]No <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> about Michigan at all anymore. That {{was in the past}} and we're all looking forward to being Buckeyes and staying Buckeyes {{for the rest of our}} lives." [...] During spring practice, Boren impressed his coaches and teammates; however, he refused all interview requests. [...] During the summer, when asked about the impending Michigan – Ohio State game he said [...] "My attitude is there are 11 games before that game,[...] [...]I can't let myself get worked up thinking about that game. I don't want to take a chance of being unprepared for any of the first 11 games. The week that game gets here, it will be my primary focus." [...] By then, he was projected to be the starting left guard, and he was expected to be an important part of the team.|$|E
500|$|From the start, Marie {{had trouble}} {{adjusting}} {{to life in}} Romania. Her personality and [...] "high spirits" [...] frequently created controversies at the Romanian court, and she disliked the austere atmosphere of her household. She wrote that she [...] "had not been brought down to Romania to be adored and spoilt and made much of; {{she had come to}} be part of the machinery King Carol had wound up. She had been imported to be trimmed, educated, cut down and trained according to the great man's conception of things." [...] When describing her early days in Romania, Marie wrote that [...] "for long hours [...] would mope, whilst [...] young husband did his military service, all alone in rooms [...] hated, heavy German rooms". Marie's paternal aunt, the Dowager German Empress, wrote to her daughter, the Crown Princess of Greece, that [...] "Missy of Roumania is more to be pitied than you. The King is a great tyrant in his family, & has crushed the independence in Ferdinand so that no <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> about him, & his beautiful & gifted little wife, I fear, gets into scrapes, & like a butterfly, instead of hovering over the flowers, burns her pretty wings by going rather near the fire!" [...] Easily learning to speak the Romanian language, she followed her mother's advice to dress carefully and show respect for Orthodox rituals.|$|E
500|$|Left Behind {{was written}} {{to focus on}} the {{relationship}} between Ellie and Riley, and to recount the events that defined their later personalities. Riley was chronologically introduced to Ellie in , a comic book written by creative director Neil Druckmann and artist Faith Erin Hicks. The team used the comic as a reference point when developing the relationship between Ellie and Riley, becoming particularly interested in having the chance to see more of their relationship; Druckmann felt that they would not have developed Left Behind if American Dreams hadn't been written. Druckmann felt that the story of Joel and Ellie's relationship in The Last of Us dealt with survival, loyalty and love, and that Ellie and Riley's relationship in Left Behind deals with similar themes. Straley felt that the themes involve love, loss and devotion, pondering the extent that one goes to protect those <b>one</b> <b>cares</b> about. Ashley Johnson portrayed Ellie in Left Behind, reprising her role from The Last of Us. To portray Riley, the team cast Yaani King; Johnson has noted that it was interesting to act against someone different, and that King fit the role immediately. King felt intimidated to become part of a large project, and was worried about [...] "fit in". The team found it interesting {{to tell the story of}} Riley, as players of The Last of Us were already aware of the effect that she had on Ellie; Left Behind sees Riley's behavior change Ellie, resulting in the latter's focus to fight in order to save those close to her. The team were also interested in Ellie's behavior around Riley; she is perceived as being more playful. In Left Behind, Ellie and Riley share a kiss; the team explored omitting the kiss from the game, but felt that it was imperative to the story, and that it strengthened the relationship. Though initially he only felt that Ellie viewed Riley as an influence, Druckmann later considered her romantic appeal, and decided to explore the concept.|$|E

2500|$|Perkins {{plays the}} protagonist Sara, a {{veterinarian}} {{who has not}} told her parents she is gay. The comedian told Lockyer that while viewers would assume that the character is based on herself, she only used [...] "trace elements" [...] of her own story for Sara. Perkins said [...] "She's a professional, grown-up woman, with a responsible job as a vet. She has a great bunch of friends, most of them heterosexual, {{and all of them}} are saying, 'What's your problem? No <b>one</b> <b>cares!</b> Tell your bloody parents.'"

[...] When Chinese painters work on shan shui painting, they {{do not try to}} present an image of what they have seen in the nature, but what they have thought about nature.

However, she stated that she did not think there would be [...] "this much anticipation, or acknowledgement of what I was doing".

R. xxii., end; Midr. Tch. to Ps. xci. 15). Phinehas, however, believes in man's perfectibility, and enumerates the virtues which render man worthy to receive the Holy Spirit. The Law, he says, leads to carefulness; carefulness, to diligence; diligence, to cleanliness; cleanliness, to retirement; retirement, to purity; purity, to piety; piety, to humility; humility, to fear of sin; fear of sin, to holiness; holiness, to the reception of the Holy Spirit; and the Holy Spirit, to resurrection (Ab.
