5|$|Based on {{a decree}} by Emperor Francis II inflicting punishments on German {{subjects}} who {{collaborated with the}} French revolutionary government, Forster was declared an outlaw and placed under the Imperial ban; a prize of 100 ducats was set {{on his head and}} he could not return to Germany. Devoid of all means <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> and without his wife, who had stayed in Mainz with their children and her later husband Ludwig Ferdinand Huber, he remained in Paris. At this point the revolution in Paris had entered the Reign of Terror introduced by the Committee of Public Safety under the rule of Maximilien Robespierre. Forster had the opportunity to experience the difference between the promises of the revolution of happiness for all and its cruel practice. In contrast to many other German supporters of the revolution, like for instance Friedrich Schiller, Forster did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals under the pressure of the terror. He viewed the events in France as a force of nature that could not be slowed and that had to release its own energies to avoid being even more destructive.|$|E

25|$|Baseball memorabilia and souvenirs, {{including}} baseball cards, {{exploded in}} price as networks of adults became more sophisticated in their trading. This would explode yet {{again in the}} late 1990s, as the Internet, and the website eBay provided venues for collectors of all things baseball to trade with each other. Regionalized pricing was wiped away, and many objects, baseballs, bats, and the like began selling for high dollar values. This in turn brought in new businessmen whose sole means <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> was acquiring autographs and memorabilia from the athletes. Memorabilia hounds fought with fans to get signatures worth $20, $60, or even $100 or more in their stores.|$|E
25|$|Biogeography is {{the study}} of the {{geographical}} distribution of species. Evidence from biogeography, especially from the biogeography of oceanic islands, {{played a key role in}} convincing both Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace that species evolved with a branching pattern of common descent. Islands often contain endemic species, species not found anywhere else, but those species are often related to species found on the nearest continent. Furthermore, islands often contain clusters of closely related species that have very different ecological niches, that is have different ways <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> in the environment. Such clusters form through a process of adaptive radiation where a single ancestral species colonises an island that has a variety of open ecological niches and then diversifies by evolving into different species adapted to fill those empty niches. Well-studied examples include Darwin's finches, a group of 13 finch species endemic to the Galápagos Islands, and the Hawaiian honeycreepers, a group of birds that once, before extinctions caused by humans, numbered 60 species filling diverse ecological roles, all descended from a single finch like ancestor that arrived on the Hawaiian Islands some 4 million years ago. Another example is the Silversword alliance, a group of perennial plant species, also endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, that inhabit a variety of habitats and come in a variety of shapes and sizes that include trees, shrubs, and ground hugging mats, but which can be hybridised with one another and with certain tarweed species found on the west coast of North America; it appears that one of those tarweeds colonised Hawaii in the past, and gave rise to the entire Silversword alliance.|$|E

After twice breaking his hand, he decided he needed a different means <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>living.</b> Sims had noticed that boxing audiences reacted positively {{to the way he}} would dance in the rosin box before getting into the ring, and especially to the distinctive sound his dancing made moving the rosin granules around the wooden box. He began to consider dancing as a career alternative. Sims experimented with several different methods of reproducing the rosin box effect, gluing sandpaper to either his shoes or his dancing mat, but the sandpaper created too much wear on the other surface. Finally he found the solution: loose sand in a low-lipped box. [...] "People went for the scraping sound... So I made a sound board by sprinkling sand on a flat platform. That was in 1935." [...] His sandbox remained his trademark throughout his career, with some venues even telling Sims, [...] "If you don't bring your sandbox, don't come at all." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{exhibition}} of the Elephant Man was reasonably successful, particularly with the added income from a printed pamphlet about Merrick's life and condition. At this time, however, public opinion about freak shows was starting to change and the display of human novelties was beginning {{to be viewed as}} distasteful. After only a few weeks with Norman, the Elephant Man exhibition was shut down by the police, and Norman and Merrick parted ways. Treves later arranged for Merrick to live at the London Hospital until Merrick's death in 1890. In Treves's 1923 memoir, The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences Norman was portrayed as a drunk who cruelly exploited Merrick. Norman counteracted these claims in a letter in the World's Fair newspaper that year, as well as his own autobiography. Norman's opinion was that he provided Merrick (and his other exhibits) a way <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> and remaining independent, but that on entering the London Hospital, Merrick remained a freak on display, only with no control over how or when he was viewed. [...] The character Bytes, portrayed by Freddie Jones in the 1980 film The Elephant Man, is based on Norman.|$|E

2500|$|Macon Shibut {{writes that}} in the mid-19th century [...] "chess was a {{gambling}} game ... Individual matches for stakes were the focus of organized play. Matches between leading players attracted a wide following so masters often succeeded in finding sponsors to back their personal wagers." [...] However, the available sums were generally relatively meager, and travel was arduous, so {{the amount of money}} obtained in this way was not sufficient to enable professional chess players to support themselves financially. Moreover, the first major chess tournament was not organized until 1851, and chess tournaments remained a rarity for several decades following. With tournaments an unreliable means <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>living,</b> odds-giving became a way for masters to entice amateurs into playing for wagers, since the odds gave the amateur a fighting chance. The odds system even became the earliest rating system: amateurs were graded according to what handicap they needed to compete against a master, and were referred to as a [...] "Rook player" [...] or [...] "Pawn and move player", for example, as we would today speak of players by their Elo ratings (e.g. a [...] "1200 player" [...] or an [...] "1800 player").|$|E

After the defeat at Ueno, he fled to Hakodate, Hokkaidō, fought in the Battle of Hakodate at the Goryōkaku star fort under the leadership of Enomoto Takeaki and Ōtori Keisuke achieving fame for his bravery.

2500|$|Finally, authors {{with strong}} {{political}} or philosophical points to make {{would no longer}} turn to the stage as their first hope <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>living.</b> Prior to 1737, plays were de rigueur for authors who were not journalists. This {{had to do with}} the economics of booksellers. A bookseller would purchase a book from an author, whether that book was Gulliver's Travels or Collected Sermons, and would calculate his chances of making money off of sales. He would pay the author according to the money he expected to make. [...] (For example, Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield was famously sold to pay a single rent installment, whereas John Gay had been paid 1,000 pounds for his Poems on Various Occasions, which was more than seven years of salary for his government job). That would be the only money an author would see from the book, and therefore he or she would need to produce a new version, new book, or a serial publication of the next work to have hopes of more income. Prior to 1737, novelists had come from the ranks of satirists (Jonathan Swift) and journalists (Daniel Defoe), but these novels had in common wide changes of scenery, long plots, and often impossible things (such as talking horses)—all features that made the works unsuitable for the stage. The exception was Aphra Behn, who was a dramatist first and a novelist second. Her Oroonoko seems to have been written as a novel simply because there was no time for staging, as it was a political commentary on ongoing events, and she could not have another play on the boards at the time. Her Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister, like Gulliver's Travels and Moll Flanders, was inappropriate for the stage. [...] However, after 1737, novels began to have dramatic structures involving only normal human beings, as the stage was closed off for serious authors.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{importance}} of culture in Northern in contemporary Aboriginal development.

This is significant because northern First Nations have unique local histories and perspectives, and they continue to earn <b>a</b> <b>living</b> and self-sufficiency through traditional ways of living on the land (commercial fishing and trapping, hunting) and adapting new ways to their way of life, such as pursuing training, employment, and business opportunities. Using a methodology called snowball sampling from community contact referrals, nine participants agreed to participate in this study. The questionnaire for this study focused on the interviewees’ perceptions of Cree culture and northern ways of life, pimâtisiwin (life), and whether they thought principles <b>of</b> pimâcihowin (<b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>living)</b> influenced or should continue to influence LLRIB members and leaders to achieve mitho-pimâtisiwin (the good life). The literature and findings suggest that Cree culture, pimâtisiwin (life) and its connection to the land, and the concept <b>of</b> pimâcihowin (<b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>living)</b> are still relevant today. Overall, this study suggests that concern for northern Cree pimâtisiwin (life), the land and pimâcihowin (livelihood or <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>living),</b> strongly influenced and will likely continue to be important for LLIRB efforts to develop its people and communities thus contributing to their innovative social and developments that blend local values and principles...|$|R
