5|$|Should {{the human}} race become extinct, then the various {{features}} assembled by humanity will begin to decay. The largest structures have an estimated decay half-life of about 1,000years. The last surviving structures would most likely be <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> mines, large landfills, major highways, wide canal cuts, and earth-fill flank dams. A few massive stone monuments like the pyramids at the Giza Necropolis or the sculptures at Mount Rushmore may still survive in some form after a million years.|$|E

Olympic Dam (Roxby Downs) is a large underground mine, Beverley, Four Mile and Honeymoon are in-situ leach mines and Ranger in an <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> mine in the Northern Territory. Uranium mined in Australia is mainly for export. Australia has no nuclear weapons or nuclear-powered vessels.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{works on}} the pyramid of Neferefre had just begun when Neferefre died {{unexpectedly}} in his early twenties. At the time of Nyuserre's ascension to the throne, only one step of the core of Neferefre's pyramid had been completed. The substructures, built in a large <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> {{at the center of}} the pyramid were possibly unfinished as well. Nyuserre hastily completed the pyramid by transforming it into a stylised primeval mound resembling a mastaba: the walls of the core layer already in place were covered with limestone and the top was filled with clay and stones drawn from the local desert.|$|E
5|$|Most {{exploitation}} of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere, after {{which one can}} burn the shale directly to generate electricity, or undertake further processing. The most common methods of surface mining involve <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> mining and strip mining. These procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. Underground mining of oil shale, which removes less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar method.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland {{also has}} an {{economic}} system for garbage disposal, which is based mostly on recycling and energy-producing incinerators {{due to a lack}} of space for <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> garbage disposals. As in other European countries, the Illegal disposal of garbage is not tolerated but usually the enforcement of such laws is limited to violations that involve the unlawful disposal of garbage bags at traffic intersections and public areas. In some cities, stickers need to be purchased that allow for identification of disposable garbage.|$|E

5|$|The Corsica and Elba mines {{remained}} the chief {{source of employment}} until 1926, when the underground Elba mine closed. It had been mined out. A few years later, the Corsica mine was converted into an <b>open</b> <b>pit,</b> {{and the future of}} the town once again seemed secure. Then the Great Depression hit. In the fall of 1929, Corsica closed and stayed closed for many years, with only a few salaried people retained. The mine remained idle until 1940, ironically receiving an honorable mention in the National Safety Competition from the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1934. Once World War II began, the mining business boomed again.|$|E
5|$|Most copper is mined or {{extracted}} as copper sulfides {{from large}} <b>open</b> <b>pit</b> mines in porphyry copper deposits that contain 0.4 to 1.0% copper. Sites include Chuquicamata in Chile, Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah, United States and El Chino Mine in New Mexico, United States. According to the British Geological Survey in 2005, Chile {{was the top}} producer of copper with at least one-third world share followed by the United States, Indonesia and Peru. Copper can also be recovered through the in-situ leach process. Several sites {{in the state of}} Arizona are considered prime candidates for this method. The amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available is barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage.|$|E
5|$|Uranium ore is mined {{in several}} ways: by <b>open</b> <b>pit,</b> underground, in-situ leaching, and {{borehole}} mining (see uranium mining). Low-grade uranium ore mined typically contains 0.01 to 0.25% uranium oxides. Extensive measures must {{be employed to}} extract the metal from its ore. High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan, Canada can contain up to 23% uranium oxides on average. Uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali. The leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation, solvent extraction, and ion exchange. The resulting mixture, called yellowcake, contains at least 75% uranium oxides U3O8. Yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion.|$|E
40|$|The work {{develops}} {{some new}} methods and complexes which provide for an effective transfer {{of a rock}} mass in <b>open</b> <b>pits</b> and provides their systemization, and develops a method for calculating the parameters and characteristics {{of the use of}} new systems.

The yield from the first phase of mining will be ground through one semi-autogenous grinding mill (SAG mill). Expansion to new underground areas will result in an additional increase of up to 140,000 tonnes per day with a possible increase to 170,000 tonnes per day.|$|E

40|$|The 3 D {{monitoring}} {{system based on}} a surveying robot and the Geomos software is widely used in the slope monitoring of <b>open</b> <b>pits.</b> The effect of various factors, such as refraction and blasting vibration, {{is crucial to the}} monitoring process. The probability of monitoring data to contain gross error is significantly higher than 0. 3 %. Thus, using the Paūta criterion as the elimination criterion of the gross error is unreasonable. In this study, the data on multi-period monitoring were used as the source, and the accuracy requirements of the Code for Engineering Survey (2007) were set as the goal of the slope monitoring of <b>open</b> <b>pits.</b> The actual probability of the monitoring data to contain gross error was calculated through mathematical statistics.
