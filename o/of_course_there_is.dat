25|$|In 2005, 22% of American {{households}} had two income earners. The {{vast majority}} (97%) of {{households in the}} top quintile had two or more income earners.

This {{raises the question of whether}} or not the combination of incomes results in higher social status. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no definite answer as class is a vague sociological concept.|$|E

So far as any Party can express what appears to me to be the country's needs, the ILP approximates nearer to my outlook that any other, although I still look forward to and hope for the day when all really progressive forces can unite under the title of the Democratic Party. But Liberalism as represented by both wings — the Lloyd George wing, and the Asquith wing, is right outside my outlook now.|$|E

The left panel features the attacking plane—placed at a diagonal {{to create a sense}} of depth—below the text balloon, which Lichtenstein has relegated to the margin above the plane. In the right panel, the exploding plane—depicted head-on—is outlined by the flames, accompanied by the bold exclamation [...] "WHAAM!". Although separate, with one panel containing the missile launch and the other its explosion, representing two distinct events, the two panels are clearly linked spatially and temporally, not least by the horizontal smoke trail of the missile. Lichtenstein commented on this piece in a 10 July 1967, letter: [...] "I remember being concerned with the idea of doing two almost separate paintings having little hint of compositional connection, and each having slightly separate stylistic character. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> the humorous connection of one panel shooting the other." ...|$|E

HitFix's Melinda Newman praised the direction by Mert and Marcus, feeling that [...] "the clip is a luscious collection of erotic images: two men biting an apple together, backlit men dancing in high heels, and Madge, looking as if she’s a dewy 25-year old." [...] A review in The Week praised the video for being self-referential with its [...] "dark, dominatrix-y" [...] visuals. Amanda Dobbins from New York magazine gave a positive review for the appearance of Kazaky and Madonna's look in the video.

He then examines how Plath blamed her father for her suffering, and identifies him in her poem [...] "Daddy" [...] with Nazism and makes allusions to the holocaust. Dalrymple writes that [...] "Plath felt it right to allude {{to one of the}} worst and most deliberate inflictions of mass-suffering in the whole of human history, merely on the basis that her father, who died when she was young, was German…the metaphorical use of the holocaust measures not the scale of her suffering, but of her self-pity". He asserts that before Plath, self-pity [...] "was regarded as a vice, even a disgusting one, that precluded sympathy", and that [...] "the appropriation of the suffering of others to boost the scale and significance of one's own suffering is now a commonplace." [...] He then analyses a number of figures, including Binjamin Wilkomirski and Margaret Seltzer, who he alleges [...] "make bogus claims to victim status" [...] and whose stories reveal perfectly [...] "the dialectic between sentimentality and brutality". Dalrymple ends the chapter by analysing victimhood {{in the criminal justice system}} and concludes, [...] "For the sentimentalist, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no such thing as a criminal, only an environment that has let him down".|$|E

Critics have also wondered about the woman who came between Shakespeare and the boy: [...] "And <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> the dark lady, identified alternatively as a nameless aristocrat, a commoner, Queen Elizabeth, her maid of honor Mary Fitton, the London prostitute Lucy Negro, the poet Aemilia Lanyer, and so on." ...|$|E

I knew two or three different record shops when I was growing up that had a Rob, a Dick and a Barry in them". Charlotte Tudor, of the film's distributor, Buena Vista, said: [...] "Chicago has the same feel as north London, there is a vibrant music scene, a lot of the action is set in smoky bars and, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> the climate.

2500|$|Other {{applications}} concern what logicians {{refer to}} as [...] propositions, sometimes also called propositions of Goldbach type. sentences are {{at one of the}} lowest levels of the so-called arithmetical hierarchy. These are like the Goldbach Conjecture, in stating that all natural numbers possess a certain property that is algorithmically checkable for each particular number. the number [...] is the sum of two prime numbers. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a simple algorithm to test a given number for being the sum of two primes. The Matiyasevich/MRDP Theorem implies that each such proposition is equivalent to a statement that asserts that some particular Diophantine equation has no solutions in natural numbers. A number of important and celebrated problems are of this form: in particular, Fermat's Last Theorem, the Riemann Hypothesis, and the Four Color Theorem. In addition the assertion that particular formal systems such as Peano Arithmetic or ZFC are consistent can be expressed as [...] sentences. The idea is to follow Kurt Gödel in coding proofs by natural numbers {{in such a way that}} the property of being the number representing a proof is algorithmically checkable.|$|E
