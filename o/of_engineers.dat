40|$|Rapid {{development}} and wide applications of nanotechnology {{brought about a}} significant increment on the number <b>of</b> <b>engineered</b> nanomaterials (ENs) inevitably entering our living system. Plants comprise of a very important living component of the terrestrial ecosystem. Studies on the influence <b>of</b> <b>engineered</b> nanomaterials (carbon and metal/metal oxides based) on plant growth indicated that in the excess content, engineered nanomaterials influences seed germination. It assessed the shoot-to-root ratio {{and the growth of}} the seedlings. From the toxicological studies to date, certain types <b>of</b> <b>engineered</b> nanomaterials can be toxic once they are not bound to a substrate or if they are freely circulating in living systems. It is assumed that the different types <b>of</b> <b>engineered</b> nanomaterials affect the different routes, behavior, and the capability of the plants. Furthermore, different, or even opposing conclusions, have been drawn from most studies on the interactions between engineered nanomaterials with plants. Therefore, this paper comprehensively reviews the studies on the different types <b>of</b> <b>engineered</b> nanomaterials and their interactions with different plant species, including the phytotoxicity, uptakes, and translocation <b>of</b> <b>engineered</b> nanomaterials by the plant at the whole plant and cellular level...|$|R

A detailed description of potential construction methods and the overall plan for the project were included, as were reports about the site's geography and hydrology. In total, the report encompassed two volumes including more than 480 pages. Because the construction season at the site is only five months, the Corps <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> projected that several decades {{would be needed to}} build the dam and associated structures.|$|E

Four months later, the Army Corps <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> held a meeting to decide what to take into account for the impact statement and held opinions from both the supporters and opponents of the freeway. Around this time, locals sent an editorial to News 12 New Jersey to say that Middlesex County Route 522, already a four-lane freeway, should become the primary freeway across the portion of Middlesex County. However, the Turnpike Authority replied citing that Route 522 would be inadequate to handle the amount of traffic by 2015 that Route 92 was to handle. In December 2003, the Army Corps <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> approved the statement and although agencies still disagreed on the wetlands issues, held public hearings in 2004.|$|E
