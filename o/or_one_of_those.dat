500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars, calling it [...] "the 'Good Burger' of animation... plopping us down inside a {{fast-food}} war being fought by sponges, starfish, crabs, tiny plankton and mighty King Neptune." [...] Ed Park of The Village Voice wrote, [...] "No Pixar? No problem! An unstoppable good-mood generator, the resolutely 2-D [...] SpongeBob SquarePants Movie has more yuks than Shark Tale and enough soul to swallow The Polar Express whole." [...] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, calling it [...] "an animated adventure that's funnier than Shark Tale and more charming than The Polar Express." [...] Randy Cordova of The Arizona Republic said, [...] "Like the TV show it's based on, it's a daffy, enjoyable creation." [...] Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the feature a score of {{three out of four}}: [...] "It's not The Incredibles, <b>or</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> animated features that spent zillions on character design, pedigree and verisimilitude. But SpongeBob is a sweet, silly thing with a child-friendly esthetic all its own." [...] Will Lawrence of Empire gave the film four out of five stars, calling it [...] "a film for kids, students, stoners, anyone who enjoys a break from reality." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave it a B-minus grade: [...] "The best moments in his [...] first movie outing are those that feel most TV-like, just another day in the eternally optimistic undersea society created with such contagious silliness by Stephen Hillenburg." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post enjoyed the film: [...] "You gotta love SpongeBob. Coolest sponge in the sea, although this one has a suspiciously manufactured look." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ann Powers {{from the}} Milwaukee Journal Sentinel called the song a [...] "...mix of voluptuous singing and {{metallic}} guitar (the latter enhanced by guest vocalist Paul McCoy's rap-rock declamations)". Bryan Reeseman of Mix {{wrote that the}} song was a [...] "...grandiose and moody single" [...] which features a [...] "...dramatic trade-off" [...] between Lee and McCoy. While reviewing Evanescence's second studio album, Don Kaye of Blabbermouth.net praised the songs on The Open Door saying that they lacked [...] "...the annoying faux-rapping that was {{a key component of}} the band's first big hit, 'Bring Me To Life' (here's hoping that more rock bands feel less pressure to include some sort of hip-hop nod on their records)." [...] David Peschek of The Guardian said: [...] "Take away the identikit rock riffs and Bring Me to Life could be a Britney Spears song, <b>or</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> cheesily portentous techno-pop mini-symphonies for the Gatecrasher kids." [...] Nick Catucci of The Village Voice compared the song with works by American rock band Creed, and said that it sounds like [...] "church-burning, brain-eating European dark metal." [...] John Hood of the Miami New Times called [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] a [...] "... huge, heavy, and mightily histrionic" [...] song while complimenting McCoy's [...] "... rap-infused gruff" [...] and Lee's soaring voice.|$|E

60|$|Thomas Idle yielded {{his arm to}} {{the ready}} Goodchild, and descended from the vehicle.
