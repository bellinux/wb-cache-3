It adds to qualitative data on this issue by discussing recent survey data, from the British and Scottish Social Attitudes surveys 2006, in which for the first time people are asked about their reasons for making a specific choice of national identity. In so doing it fleshes out the responses given to a well known survey question (the so-called 'Moreno' question) providing a greater understanding of what a large sample <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> when they make these territorial identity choices. The English and the Scots handle 'national' and 'state' identities differently, but the paper shows there is considerable similarity as regards reasons for choosing national identity. Both English and Scottish 'nationals', those placing greater weight on their 'national' as opposed to their 'state' identities, choose to do so mainly for cultural and institutional reasons. They are not making a 'political' statement about the break-up of Britain. At the British end of the scale, there are patterns in the English data which throw into doubt easy assertions about 'being British'. Simply assuming, as some politicians and commentators do, that 'British' has singular meanings is unfounded. The future of the United Kingdom as presently constituted may lie in the hands of those who describe themselves as equally national (English or Scottish) and British. Devolution influences which national identity people choose in all three sets of national identity categories but these effects are sociologically most interesting in this group. Devolution seems to have encouraged them to stress the equality of the two nations in the British state, recognising that they are equal partners, that one can be equally proud of a national and a British identity, and that it is not necessary to choose one over the other.

40|$|Medicine, Alternative, Healing, IntegrativeMixing Medicine A {{new school}} of "integrative" health-care {{providers}} {{sets out to}} wed alternative treatments to mainstream medical practice. by Deborah Rudacille Since childhood, Wendy Lafferman, 27, has suffered from headaches. Diagnosed with migraines in high school, she has seen numerous doctors and swallowed a mountain of pills to combat pain so severe that "sometimes I'm literally digging my head into a pillow," she says. So when a friend of her mother raved about a neurologist in Pikesville who had assembled an unconventional team of practitioners-including a hypnotherapist, an acupuncturist, and a naturopath-to treat headache, Lafferman was not impressed. "I've been seeing doctors for fifteen years," she told her mom. "Nothing is going to help. " But at the Mid-Atlantic Headache Institute (MAHI), she found a neurologist, Marcia Ribeiro, who supported her use of alternative healing practices like acupuncture and cranio-facial massage while fine-tuning a pharmaceutical regimen aimed at reducing the frequency and severity of her headaches. "Dr. Ribeiro is willing to walk that path with me," Lafferman says. A few months after starting treatment at MAHI (and switching to a nutritionist-recommended diet free of gluten and sugar), {{she says she is}} doing much better. "This is the first time I've made it completely through a full week of work in months. " Lafferman's embrace of "integrative medicine," which links a range of alternative healing practices with traditional Western medicine, is shared by a steadily growing number of Americans. Approximately 38 percent of people over the age of 18 (and 12 percent of children) use some form of alternative or "complementary" medicine, according to a 2007 survey carried out by the National Center for Health Statistics. Use of non-vitamin, non-mineral natural products such as fish oil, flaxseed, and echinacea top the list; other therapies include deep breathing, meditation, and massage. From acupuncture to herbal supplements to yoga, alternative healing-typically dispensed out of people's homes, small offices, and clinics-is booming. But most American physicians are considerably less enthusiastic about these treatments than their patients. A kind of "don't ask, don't tell" policy rules-many doctors don't ask and patients don't tell them about their use of alternative healing methods not legitimized by science. "[Doctors] are not familiar with this, and yet nearly 50 percent of their patients are using alternative or complementary medicine," says Brian Berman, director of the Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. "We need to make sure they know about them so they can refer appropriately. Whether or not they use the therapies themselves, they {{need to be able to}} work together in a larger team. " When Berman founded CIM-the first such center in an academic medical institution in the country-eighteen years ago, he and other proponents of integrating alternative therapies with Western medicine were on the far fringes of medical practice. Today, forty-five universities around the country have some kind of program in integrative medicine, combining research, teaching, and clinical practice in varying proportions. But the approach has been slower to penetrate the ranks of practitioners. "I would like to see it more widely adopted so that it's part and parcel of standard care," Berman says. "But there are still quite a few skeptics. " MAHI provides a glimpse of the kind of integrative medicine practice that Berman and other alt-med pioneers have long envisioned. The institute looks like a typical doctor's office, with a suite of examining rooms and offices. There are no trickling fountains or Chinese ideograms on the walls in the waiting room-just copies of WebMD and patient information brochures, industrial carpeting, and a receptionist's counter with glass windows and stacks of insurance forms. But some of the activities carried out here are revolutionary in such a setting. In one room, physical therapist Rupal Davé massages a patient's head, neck, and shoulders, easing the tension that can lead to headaches. Licensed clinical social worker Dale Liebman conducts hypnotherapy, helping patients manage stress via visualization. Cognitive psychologist H. Richard Waranch uses biofeedback and behavioral counseling. Acupuncturist and naturopathic physician Stacey Kargman checks for food allergies and recommends herbal supplements. "Other practices are largely driven by pharmacy," Liebman points out. "We take a more holistic approach. " MAHI was founded by Ribeiro and nurse practitioner Maureen Ann Moriarty in 2004. Both had worked in conventional medical practices for many years. But they wanted to do something different. Their experience at MAHI has shown that headache patients-"people sick of being sick"-were also looking for a different approach. Patients meet first with Ribeiro, and then she and Moriarty craft an individualized treatment plan for each patient that combines pharmacy with one or more of the other services provided at the clinic. "Sometimes it's a little bit of everything," Ribeiro says. The team treats not just the pain of the headache, but also the factors behind the pain-diet, stress, personal habits, and lifestyle. It's precisely that attention to the whole person that is touted by proponents of integrative medicine as an improvement on the traditional treat-the-symptom model, particularly when it comes to chronic pain. Berman says that when he founded CIM at the University of Maryland in 1991, "we started based on pain and pain management because that's one of the areas that we don't have all the answers for in conventional medicine. " Housed partly in an old mansion on the grounds of Kernan Hospital, a short drive from the Social Security Administration in Woodlawn, CIM has grown far beyond its modest roots. The center has received more than $ 30 million in research funding from the National Institutes of Health Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine since its founding and has been an NIH Center of Excellence since 1995. Integrative medicine is now part of the medical school curriculum at Maryland, and Berman's center has worked collaboratively with the Greenbaum Cancer Center, R. Adams Cowley Shock-Trauma Center, and other medical and surgical departments. Soon, it will be conducting research with the Institute for Genome Sciences. "I would never have expected that back in ' 91," Berman admits. Across town at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the integrative approach hasn't yet penetrated the curriculum or garnered as much institutional support. But even at that bastion of empiricism, some clinicians are exploring the use of complementary modalities and have formed a loose support network. Anastasia Rowland-Seymour, a Hopkins internist, was introduced to folk healing methods while a resident at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, where she also attended medical school. "My patients were largely Dominican," she says, "and there was a lot of use of teas and tinctures and other ways of healing that seemed to have some effect. I felt that in order to provide quality care, I should know a little about what people were using and whether it was safe to take with their other meds. " After completing her residency and working for a year and a half at Harlem Hospital, she did an integrative medicine fellowship with Dr. Andrew Weil, the godfather of the discipline. "I thought I was going to learn about nutrition and supplements, which I did," she says. "But I also got exposed to other types of healing that I hadn't known much about, like acupuncture and mind-body practices, and more esoteric things like energy healing and homeopathy. " Rowland-Seymour doesn't use all of those methods in her own practice. Some patients come to her specifically because she has been recommended as someone who uses an integrative approach, but about half "don't have a clue that I'm interested in integrative medicine," she says. "For all they know, I'm just a general internist. " Patients often hesitate to volunteer information about whether they are using alternative practices or supplements because they are apprehensive about the reactions of medical doctors-with good reason. Doctors rely on data, not anecdote, when treating patients. And it's precisely the lack of good data establishing the efficacy of alternative and complementary therapies that impedes their acceptance, critics say. Steven L. Salzberg, director of the University of Maryland's Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, maintains that there is no evidence to support the claims made by proponents of acupuncture, homeopathy, and other types of alternative healing. "It's pseudoscience and quackery," he says. Salzberg, a biostatistician who is a vocal advocate for open access to research data, has helped sequence the genes of hundreds of organisms, including human and avian influenza viruses and anthrax. For scientists like him, medicine is and ought to be based in rigorous science, with data that can be quantified and results that can be validated. Alternative and complementary treatments are conspicuously lacking in these essentials, he says-and the number of people who actually use them is far lower than proponents claim, because everything from drinking herbal tea to practicing yoga is included in surveys. "They include all kinds of common practices that people don't use instead of medicine. I have herbal tea in my kitchen," he says. But that doesn't make him a supporter of what he terms "non-medical, non-scientific" approaches to treating disease. Salzberg doesn't object to the wellness aspects of integrative medicine-controlling diet, exercising, and managing stress. He says doctors should and do regularly speak with patients about such preventive practices, which are "all good things with plenty of evidence to support them. " But he has strong words for medical schools that have begun offering fellowships in integrative medicine that include such practices as Reiki (a spiritual healing technique from Japan) and traditional Chinese medicine. "They are training reputable doctors in what is nothing more than voodoo," he says. Much of the improvement experienced by people who use such alternative therapies can be explained by the placebo effect, he adds. "If they are being treated for mild pain, which comes and goes, and they are seeing a therapist, they'll give them the credit. The only harm is to their wallet. " He is much harder on acupuncture, which is probably the most accepted alternative therapy but whose effectiveness is unsupported by data, he says. "Acupuncture, ayurveda, homeopathy-all of these things were made up in the premedical era, and people still cling to them despite the fact that whenever controlled studies are done, there is no evidence that they work at all. " And that has real-world consequences, he says. He points to a British study that revealed alternative practitioners recommending homeopathy as a substitute for vaccination for people preparing to travel in Africa. "Most of the stuff is harmless. Where it becomes harmful is when people who have real diseases use it as a substitute for medicine. " Rowland-Seymour, Ribeiro, and Berman all point out that herbs, yoga, and massage are not a replacement for medical treatment. "I don't want to give people the impression that just because they walk into my office and I know something about supplements that may be useful that I am going to tell them to use that instead of conventional remedies," says Rowland-Seymour. "That would be irresponsible. " Rowland-Seymour understands the skepticism from other physicians. Integrative medicine "is not well-accepted by many of my colleagues in part because there are concerns about what might be suggested to patients and what patients are doing already that physicians don't know about," she says. "Also, there are studies that are perfect in terms of methodology and there are studies that are very much less than perfect. That makes it very difficult to determine whether something has efficacy, whether it's really safe. So I completely understand the reticence. " But she and others like her are more willing than the average physician-and certainly more willing than scientists like Salzberg-to believe that practitioners other than medical doctors have a role to play in health care. Ribeiro, for example, works closely with naturopathic physician Stacey Kargman, who has a busy practice of her own, the Maryland Natural Health Center, a few miles from MAHI. Naturopaths promote the innate healing ability of the human body and rely on diet, exercise, lifestyle changes, and herbal supplements to combat disease and maintain health. In working with headache patients, Kargman examines their lifestyle and diet and does allergy testing for corn, wheat, and dairy. "If I find something, we'll do a trial for six to eight weeks, maybe stop eating wheat, for example," she says. "Often that does the trick. Just by eliminating or cutting down something in the diet you can eliminate or at least reduce the frequency of headache. " When she sees people with serious illnesses, however, she refers them to specialists. "I will send people to a cardiologist or neurologist if I think they need a more specific diagnosis or treatment," she says. The reason the collaboration with Ribeiro works, Kargman says, "is that we both support what the other is doing. We use the best of both worlds. " That, notes Berman, is the very definition of integrative medicine. "There's a lot of good in conventional medicine, and we don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater," he says. "But we need other members of the team, like the acupuncturist, nutritionist, and maybe the yoga teacher. We shift the focus so that [health care] is not just about disease management but health and wellbeing across the life span. " The approach is especially effective in treating chronic disease, he and other practitioners point out. Unlike infectious disease, chronic disease is often created and exacerbated by diet and lifestyle-and that's particularly true of chronic pain. "Pain comes from a lot of different levels: emotional, mental, physical, and maybe even spiritual," Berman points out. "A lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> that we need a more multi-disciplinary approach to deal effectively with that. " The anecdotal evidence, at least, bears this out. Both Lafferman and Sharon Chafee, a patient of Kargman's who adopted a diet to treat her fibromyalgia (chronic muscle pain and fatigue), experienced significant improvement. Chaffee also dropped 30 pounds. "I'm 53 years old, and I've never felt this good," she says. Both women also say that when they slip up and eat a forbidden food, their symptoms return. "I did it for about a month and felt good, but then ate two chocolate cookies and I got so sick," Lafferman says. She was convinced her to stick to the diet. Weight loss can be quantified, but pain is subjective and difficult to measure. When improvement can be quantified and validated in a controlled study, skeptics may relinquish their doubts. "A good scientist wants to know the truth," Salzberg says. "If a treatment works and can be shown to work by scientifically valid studies, we call it medicine. " However, the history of medicine shows that radically new approaches often need time to be accepted, even when empirical evidence supports their efficacy. In 1847, when Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis ordered obstetricians at his Viennese clinic to wash their hands in chlorinated lime solution before attending women in labor, he was ridiculed. Even after the mortality rate from "childbed fever" fell from 18 percent to 4 percent at the clinic- and to nearly zero when instruments too were treated with the solution-his observational data were dismissed because he could not offer a scientific explanation for his findings. He was vindicated, of course, when germ theory was developed-about thirty years later. -Deborah Rudacille writes frequently about health and science. Buyer Beware Just because something is natural doesn't mean it's harmless. Herbal supplements and vitamins are not tested for potency, safety, or efficacy by the Food and Drug Administration-and many are little more than filler. "People bring in stuff they've bought cheaply," says naturopathic physician Stacey Kargman of the Maryland Natural Health Center, "and when you look at the ingredient label, it's mostly colors and dyes. " Some herbal preparations and vitamins can react with drugs. Johns Hopkins internist Anastasia Rowland-Seymour recommends developing a good relationship with a pharmacist if you plan on self-medicating with herbal remedies. "Pharmacists have access to great databases and can check if there are known interactions," she says. If you want to do research on your own, check out the data reviews in the Cochrane Collaboration (www. cochrane. org), an international clearinghouse for information on evidence-based medicine. In 2007, the National Institutes of Health granted a five-year, $ 2. 1 million research grant to the Cochrane's complementary and alternative medicine arm, based at the University of Maryland's Center for Integrative Medicine. Center director Brian Berman says the funding has helped gather and publish clinical trials of alternative therapies and conduct research to improve the methodology of literature reviews. "We've been working with people all over the world," he says. It's also important to check the credentials of alt-medicine providers. "Ask about licensing and whether or not they went to an accredited naturopathic program," Kargman says. She attended a naturopathic medicine program in Arizona, one of only four in the country, and is currently licensed by the state of Vermont. (Maryland does not license naturopathic physicians, though the state does license acupuncturists.) To find a licensed practicioner, go to www. naturopathic. org, the website of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians. No matter which alternative practices you are using, your primary care doctor should know about it, says Rowland-Seymour. "Even if your physician doesn't have a huge knowledge base about integrative medicine, they need to know what you are doing. " -D. R...|$|E

The Raffles Hotel manager had asked, “It would be great to have a simple and meaningful analysis <b>of</b> what <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> about our property online. What would be really great, though, would be to know who <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> what. I would love the ability to link our internal database of guest names, duration of stay, and so on, with reviews that are posted online. ” With this challenge in mind Langlois would meet with the development team {{to figure out how to}} design the new feature, and then with the CEO to see if this new direction fit with the business objectives and was worth the investment...|$|R

Entertainment Weekly said its effects [...] "have the impressive digital sheen of Episode I", while IFILM programming director said the film [...] "absolutely blew me away, and a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> out there <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> this <b>is</b> the best they've ever come across."

This is the kind <b>of</b> thing <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> about Jews in the 1930s and ’40s in Europe." [...] Maher responded to Armstrong's comments by telling Vanity Fair, [...] "It’s beyond stupid. Jews weren’t oppressing anybody. There weren’t 5,000 militant Jewish groups. They didn’t do a study of treatment of women around the world and find that the Jews were at the bottom of it. There weren’t 10 Jewish countries in the world that <b>were</b> putting gay <b>people</b> to death just for being gay. It’s idiotic." [...] After that Armstrong reiterated her criticism of Maher by telling The New York Times, [...] "My problem with some current critics of Islam is that their criticism is neither accurate, fair, nor well-informed. I am sure they do not intend this, but in the 1930s and ’40s in Europe, we learned how dangerous and ultimately destructive this kind of discourse could be." ...|$|R

According to Hoffenberg, Terry Southern and I wrote Candy for the money. Olympia Press, $500 flat. He was in Switzerland, I was in Paris. We did it in letters. But when it got to be a big deal in the States, everybody was taking it seriously. Do you remember what kind <b>of</b> shit <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying?</b> One guy wrote a review about how Candy was a satire on Candide. So right away I went back and reread Voltaire {{to see if he was}} right. That's what happens to you. It's as if you vomit in the gutter and everybody starts saying it's the greatest new art form, so you go back to see it, and, by God, you have to agree.|$|R

The chances are that we shall live to be old men and women, and we are not going to be frightened about dying forty years before our death.

40|$|People {{often think}} about events that span a {{continuum}} of the past to the present to the future. Much past research has concentrated on differences in how people think about the past, present, and future (Jason et al. 1989; Van Boven & Ashworth, 2007). But, people also reference these time frames in speech for events that will or have happened. However, relatively {{little is known about}} why people choose to speak about one time frame versus another [...] something they do very regularly, and the content of which could have implications for individual emotionality (Hart, 2013), idea generation (Rollier & Turner, 1994), and sales (Chevalier & Mayzlin, 2006). Dr. Jonah Berger and I aim to explore why individuals elect to speak about the past, the present, or the future, and why they choose to discuss one time frame. We have chosen to investigate this question by examining data from a real world context <b>of</b> what <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> before proceeding with lab experiments to test potential mechanisms. For real world data, we employ online and offline communication channels because prior literature has found that communication channel can change both conversation norms and whether people discuss more accessible or more interesting topics (Berger & Iyengar...|$|R

Singer-guitarist Levin Hoffman, on the {{strength}} <b>of</b> what <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>are</b> ‘great songs’, rapidly takes his band the Barking Dogs {{to the top of}} the charts. Levin — believe it or not — finds that success is hollow and that not even his devoted Indian-Australian girlfriend, Shelley, or his long-time friend-cum-manager, Lawrence, can rescue him from his indefinable angst. The second half of the book sees Levin in Thailand, where, lying low at a monastery after witnessing a horrific murder, he becomes a devotee of meditation...|$|R

40|$|The {{rise of the}} {{blogosphere}} has empowered the average consumer to influence the public perception and profitability of brands. As such, marketing organizations need to <b>be</b> aware <b>of</b> what <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> in influential blogs, how the expressed opinions could impact their business, and how to extract business insight and value from these blogs. This {{has given rise to}} the emerging discipline of Social Media Analytics, which draws from Social Network Analysis, Machine Learning, Data Mining, Information Retrieval, and Natural Language Processing. The automated analysis of blogs and other social media raises several interesting challenges, which we address below. Seeking Relevance: The immediate objective is to effectively filter down the vast blogosphere from millions to the thousands of blogs most relevant to the brand/product being monitored. We want not only the blogs that directly talk about a specific product, but also those about competing products and potential new customers. Given the complexity of this task, simple keyword searches are inadequate; and instead, we explore text-based and network-based techniques. Based on the content of blogs, we label some posts as relevant or irrelevant, and treat relevance filtering as a standard text classification problem. An alternative to such text-based techniques is relevance filtering via graph based methods. Known relevant blogs may be viewed as positive labels on a large partially labeled blog graph. Then assuming that links encode similar degrees of relevance, we can apply...|$|R

[...] She had lost the self-sufficiency that had made roaming about London by herself a pleasurable adventure; and a newly-born fear <b>of</b> what <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> and thinking about her made her shy even of the few friends she still clung to, so that his visits grew to be of the nature of childish treats to which she found herself looking forward--counting the days. Also, she came to be dependent upon him for the keeping alight within her of that little kindly fire of self-conceit at which we warm our hands in wintry days. It is not good that a young woman should remain for long a stranger to her mirror--above her frocks, indifferent to the angle of her hat. She had met the women superior to feminine vanities. Handsome enough, some of them must once have been; now sunk in slovenliness, uncleanliness, in disrespect to womanhood. It would not be fair to him. The worshipper has his rights. The goddess must remember always that she is a goddess--must pull herself together and behave as such, appearing upon her pedestal becomingly attired; seeing to it that in all things she is at her best; not allowing private grief to render her neglectful of this duty.|$|R

In his essay on The Practice and Theory of Inoculation he narrates his experience in three hundred and fifty cases, only one having died by the smallpox so induced.

Ismail's forces used explosives to blow open a navigable waterway through the second cataract so his ships could pass through to the south. As the army advanced, they received the submission of the kashif of Lower Nubia, which was only nominally subject to Ottoman rule, and when they passed the second cataract, the ruler of Say likewise submitted, although he later rebelled and was killed in fighting. The <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Say</b> <b>were</b> descendants of Bosniak soldiery long ago posted there, and were described as 'white as the Arabs of lower Egypt'. At Dongola some of the Mamluks submitted, and others fled upstream to take refuge with Mek Nimr of Shendi.|$|R

Opinions are {{often based on}} shared stories and collectively these opinions are the community sentiment that affects the way people live and act. This magazine was produced by a collaboration between the ECU Journalism Program and the Shire of Ashburton that set out to track the shifts in the community sentiment in Onslow over the construction phase of the Wheatstone and Macedon gas hubs. The project aims to capture the stories being told in Onslow as the town changes, regardless of their factual accuracy. Where possible we have sought to verify facts and provide balance, {{but we have not}} excluded comments by community members {{on the grounds that they}} didn 2 ̆ 7 t check out, because if we did that, then this would not be an accurate record <b>of</b> what <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> In all cases we have been careful to correctly report what people said in our interviews. The result is a sometimes optimistic and sometimes disgruntled reaction to the town 2 ̆ 7 s rapid, but in some ways not rapid enough, growth spurt. We hope that you enjoy this snapshot of what was being said in Onslow in the middle of 2013 and find it interesting food for thought about the impact of major resource projects on their host communities. There is a digital version of the magazine available on the website so you can email a link to it to your family and friends in other places. The website also has soon-to-be updated galleries showing how parts of the town have changed almost beyond recognition and video interviews with Onslow locals. We look forward to seeing you when we come back in early 2014...|$|R

She is regarded as quite much disposed for love adventures, although she has a great ability to conceal them; at present, however, she has not managed to do so, because her lover has {{the same sense of}} humor as she does, and their common weakness has exposed them. People hungry for scandals wish to claim that {{it is not so much}} inclination that attaches her to her lovers as it is the presents they give her. I admit that I do not believe such a vile accusation, and generally I do not believe half <b>of</b> what <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> for at present every one in Stockholm is terribly mean. The one presently enjoying the affection of countess Meyerfelt is a colonel lieutenant baron Ehrensvärd, who are especially witty but quite mean. He was previously well seen by the King, but has fallen from grace since the last Assembly of the estates, were he proved himself to be too talkative." [...] Louise Meijerfeldt was known for her love life and among her lovers were the Spanish envoy count de Lacy, the French envoy Pierre Chrysostème Dusson de Bonnac (1774), field marshal Fredrik Vilhelm von Hessenstein (1774) and governor baron Carl Sparre (1777).Her spouse was described as both ugly and boring, but reportedly, they lived harmoniously with each other, and it was said that she used to inform him about the compliments given to her by her lovers.|$|R
