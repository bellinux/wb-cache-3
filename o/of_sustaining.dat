The council made it a condition of sponsoring the LSO that the profit-sharing principle should be abandoned and the players made salaried employees. This renunciation of the principles for which the LSO had been founded was rejected by the players, and the offered subsidy was declined.|$|E

5|$|Although Fresnel's {{hypothesis}} was empirically successful in explaining Fizeau's results, many leading {{experts in the}} field, including Fizeau himself (1851), Éleuthère Mascart (1872), Ketteler (1873), Veltmann (1873), and Lorentz (1886) were united in considering Fresnel's partial aether-dragging hypothesis to be on shaky theoretical grounds. For example, Veltmann (1870) demonstrated that Fresnel's formula implies that the aether {{would have to be}} dragged by different amounts for different colors of light, since the index of refraction depends on wavelength; Mascart (1872) demonstrated a similar result for polarized light traveling through a birefringent medium. In other words, the aether must be capable <b>of</b> <b>sustaining</b> different motions at the same time.|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} principles <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> yield {{have long}} been relied upon in the planning of forestry management. Along with the more recently introduced concept <b>of</b> multiple-use, <b>sustained</b> yield remains the catchcry of forest managers. The principles <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> yield concentrate on planning the extent and timing of harvesting for wood production objectives. However, in the transition from forestry management to forest management, these principles, with their heavy emphasis on wood production objectives, have been at variance with the multiple use concept {{in a number of}} ways. This study attempts to document these areas of conflict for forest management in Tasmania. Sustained yield management in Tasmania is carried out on a regional basis. One of these regions, the Southern Forests, is used as a case study for examining the compatibility between the application <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> yield and multiple use concepts. The techniques <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> yield management used in the Southern Forests are documented with particular attention being paid to the assumptions made in the planning of management operations. These assumptions are then analysed in terms of their potential effect on management's ability to incorporate non-wood objectives in its planning. The study concludes that while strong reliance on the traditional principles <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> yield is maintained, non-wood values will only get partial consideration in forest management planning. This consideration is usually given where there is only minimal interference with wood production objectives. A change in the present use <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> yield estimates and a shift in the emphasis of data collection are suggested as preliminary steps in ensuring that non-wood values are given adequate consideration in forest management planning...|$|R

5|$|Catastrophic injuries—defined {{as serious}} {{injury to the}} spine, spinal cord, or brain—and {{fatalities}} are uncommon in football; both have become less common since the 1970s, although {{a small number of}} them still occur each year. Both concussions and catastrophic injuries can be caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions as well as impact against the ground or other players' knees; in other cases, they can be caused by players who have sustained a head injury returning to play, which can place the player at risk <b>of</b> <b>sustaining</b> a severe injury. Despite the decrease in catastrophic injuries, a greater number of NFL players have reported major injuries and shortened careers since the 1970s, in part due to the increasing size and speed of players and the use of artificial turf.|$|E

Special attention is given to the presence of comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The HPA axis of 30 female BPD patients with (n= 17) and without (n= 13) a history <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> childhood abuse was challenged with a combined dexamethasone and corticotropin releasing hormone test (DEX/CRH test) before and after 6 (n = 14) and 12 (n = 16) weeks of fluvoxamine treatment (150 mg/day). Both 6 - and 12 -week fluvoxamine treatments were associated with a significant and robust reduction of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol response to the DEX/CRH test. The magnitude of the reduction was dependent on the presence <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> childhood abuse, but not on the presence of comorbid MDD or PTSD: patients with a history <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> childhood abuse showed the strongest reduction in ACTH and cortisol. In conclusion, Fluvoxamine treatment reduces the hyperresponsiveness of the HPA axis in BPD patients with a history <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> childhood abuse.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of the next day, 15 September, Belisarius drew up the army for battle before the city walls, but as no enemy appeared, he led his army into the city, after again exhorting his troops to show discipline. The Roman army {{received}} a warm welcome from the populace, which was favourably impressed by its restraint. While Belisarius himself took possession of the royal palace, seated himself on the king's throne, and consumed the dinner which Gelimer had confidently ordered to be ready for his own victorious return, the fleet entered the Lake of Tunis and the army was billeted throughout the city. The remaining Vandals were rounded up and placed under guard to prevent them from causing trouble.

5|$|Pro-slavery advocates {{claimed that}} enslaved Africans were lesser {{human beings who}} benefited from their bondage. Wilberforce, the Clapham Sect and others were anxious to {{demonstrate}} that Africans, and particularly freed slaves, had human and economic abilities beyond the slave trade, {{and that they were}} capable <b>of</b> <b>sustaining</b> a well-ordered society, trade and cultivation. Inspired in part by the utopian vision of Granville Sharp, they became involved in the establishment in 1792 of a free colony in Sierra Leone with black settlers from the United Kingdom, Nova Scotia and Jamaica, as well as native Africans and some whites. They formed the Sierra Leone Company, with Wilberforce subscribing liberally to the project in money and time. The dream was of an ideal society in which races would mix on equal terms; the reality was fraught with tension, crop failures, disease, death, war and defections to the slave trade. Initially a commercial venture, the British government assumed responsibility for the colony in 1808. The colony, although troubled at times, was to become a symbol of anti-slavery in which residents, communities and African tribal chiefs, worked together to prevent enslavement at the source, supported by a British naval blockade to stem the region's slave trade.|$|E

5|$|Until the 13th century, {{the direct}} {{route to the}} sea at Highbridge was {{prevented}} by gravel banks and peat near Westhay. The course of the river partially encircled Glastonbury from the south, around the western side (through Beckery), and then north through the Panborough-Bleadney gap in the Wedmore-Wookey Hills, to join the River Axe just north of Bleadney. This route {{made it difficult for}} the officials of Glastonbury Abbey to transport produce from their outlying estates to the abbey, and when the valley of the River Axe was in flood it backed up to flood Glastonbury itself. Some time between 1230 and 1250 a new channel was constructed westwards into Meare Pool north of Meare, and further westwards to Mark Moor.
