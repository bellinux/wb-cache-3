500|$|On April 9, 1987, {{a two-hour}} meeting with {{three members of}} the FHLBB San Francisco branch was held, again in DeConcini's office, to discuss the government's {{investigation}} of Lincoln. Present were Cranston, DeConcini, Glenn, McCain, and additionally Riegle. The regulators felt that the meeting was very unusual and that they were being pressured by a united front, as the senators presented their reasons for having the meeting. DeConcini began the meeting by saying, [...] "We wanted to meet with you because we have determined that potential actions of yours could injure a constituent." [...] McCain said, [...] "One of our jobs as elected officials is to help constituents in a proper fashion. ACC [...] is a big employer and important to the local economy. I wouldn't want any special favors for them.... I don't want any part <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> to be improper." [...] Glenn said, [...] "To be blunt, you should charge them or get off their backs," [...] while DeConcini said, [...] "What's wrong with this if they're willing to clean up their act? ... It's very unusual for us to have a company that could be put out of business by its regulators." [...] The regulators then revealed that Lincoln was under criminal investigation on a variety of serious charges, at which point McCain severed all relations with Keating.|$|E

2500|$|Craig Murray, the British {{ambassador}} to Uzbekistan from 2002 to 2004, {{wrote that the}} executive director of Freedom House told him in 2003 that the group decided to back off from its efforts to spotlight human rights abuses in Uzbekistan, because some Republican board members (in Murray's words) [...] "expressed concern that Freedom House was failing to keep in sight the need to promote freedom in the widest sense, by giving full support to U.S. and coalition forces". Human rights abuses in Uzbekistan at the time included the killing of prisoners [...] by [...] "immersion in boiling liquid," [...] and by strapping on a gas mask and blocking the filters, Murray reported. Jennifer Windsor, {{the executive director of}} Freedom House in 2003, replied that Murray's [...] "characterization <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> is an inexplicable misrepresentation not only of what was said at that meeting, but of Freedom House's record in Uzbekistan ... Freedom House has been a consistent and harsh critic of the human rights situation in Uzbekistan, as clearly demonstrated in press releases and in our annual assessments of that country".|$|E
50|$|Sociolinguistics {{points out}} that in normal {{communication}} what is left unsaid is as important as what is actually said—that we expect our auditors regularly to fill in the social context/norms <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversations</b> as we proceed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then tell me {{all about}} yourself," [...] she suggested. [...] "Really, when I come to think of it, {{considering}} the length <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversations,</b> you have been remarkably reticent. You are the youngest of the family, are you not? How many brothers are there?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{paid for}} my conveyance, and we strolled along the broad sidewalk. Lady Delahaye seemed {{inclined}} to thrust the onus <b>of</b> commencing <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> upon me.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked across}} at the {{sleeping}} man. He was breathing heavily, and was evidently quite unconscious <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversation.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} subject <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> is very ill-chosen," [...] said Sir James, {{with a look}} of disgust. [...] "Suppose we change it." ...|$|E
60|$|At this juncture, {{the subject}} <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> again returned, {{and the old}} man motioning to me to {{approach}} the table, broke off, and said no more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Apparently," [...] Hamel {{observed}} drily. [...] "And yet {{you must}} remember that you, too, are afraid of him. I need not remind you <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversations,</b> but there the truth is. You praise his virtues and his charities, you pity him, and yet you go about with a load of fear, and--forgive me--of secret terror in your heart, you and Gerald, too. As for your mother--" ...|$|R
60|$|No doubt, Sir, {{that you}} have noticed during the course <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversations</b> that Nature has endowed me with an over-sensitive heart. I feel keenly, Sir, very keenly. Blows dealt me by Fate, or, as has been more often the case, by the cruel and treacherous hand of man, touch me on the raw. I suffer acutely. I am highly strung. I am {{one of those rare}} beings whom Nature pre-ordained for love and for happiness. I am an ideal family man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Ducaine," [...] he said, [...] "from {{the time}} <b>of</b> <b>our</b> last <b>conversation</b> at the War Office and our {{subsequent}} tete-a-tete I have reposed in {{you the most}} implicit confidence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is Stirling Deane. You {{remember}} the subject <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> {{the other night}} at the theatre? I am referring now to the matter of documents of which you spoke." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “What shall I do, then?” she asked, {{detecting}} the anxious glance I had {{shot at the}} object <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversation,</b> and impressed, I flatter myself, with the earnestness of my manner.|$|E
60|$|She was the {{principal}} theme <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> during the evening: and when we parted for the night Steerforth called after me over the banisters, 'Bob swore!' as I went downstairs.|$|E

5000|$|On 18 September Lloyd George {{recalled}} that: From {{the very}} outset <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversations</b> June 1921 I {{told you that}} we looked to Ireland to own allegiance to the Throne, and to make her future {{as a member of}} the British Commonwealth. That was the basis <b>of</b> <b>our</b> proposals, and we cannot alter it. The status which you now claim in advance for your delegates is, in effect, a repudiation of that basis. I am prepared to meet your delegates as I met you in July, in the capacity of 'chosen spokesmen' for your people, to discuss the association of Ireland with the British Commonwealth.|$|R
6000|$|... "He overheard part <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> on the ferry-boat {{the other}} night," [...] {{went on the}} book-keeper, hastily, [...] "and from that he judged we must be {{plotting}} to rob Mr. Sumner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you; {{and perhaps}} till {{then you will}} not, unless he happens to ask you, mention the subject <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> to Philip. I {{want to have a}} talk with him first." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} artist pages {{present an}} image and text dialogue between {{a painter and}} a performance maker. This dialogue has developed through a shared thinking through film, a medium made of singular images stitched together. Film connects painting with performance through the relation of still images with temporality; each film cell paused briefly before moving onto the next. As a means of exploring temporality in our own practice, the pages present eight still frame moments from films that have formed the center <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversations.</b> Each moment is centered on an object that initiates a syncopic action in the film...|$|R

40|$|At {{the joint}} meeting on {{national}} final accounting, we interviewed Jiang Jianping, {{the head of}} the Budget Section in the Jiangsu provincial Department of Finance; and Liu Wei, {{the head of the}} Budget Section in the Chongqing municipal Bureau <b>of</b> Finance. <b>Our</b> <b>conversation</b> with the two officials went as follows. ...|$|R
60|$|I {{began to}} undo the case. Indeed it was already half-open when two other gentlemen, who had either overheard some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> or noted my companion's excited look, edged up to us. I {{observed}} that they also wore orchids in their buttonholes.|$|E
60|$|This was {{the extent}} <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> at that time, for we came {{suddenly}} on the first pool in the river; and I soon perceived that, although the weather was good enough, the river was so flooded as to be scarcely fishable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Leave {{it all to}} me," [...] I said; then we separated, he {{to return}} to his mistress, who was no doubt anxiously waiting to know the result <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversation,</b> I to get through the next fifteen hours in the best way I could.|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] he said, earnestly, as he {{rose and}} stood in an {{attitude}} of intense attention. [...] "It may be imagination playing with the subjects <b>of</b> <b>our</b> recent <b>conversation,</b> but I cannot help thinking that I hear the beating of paddles." ...|$|R
40|$|Firstly, I {{would like}} to give thanks where thanks are due, {{starting}} with my advisors, Dr. Matthew T. Andrews and Dr. Lester R. Drewes. They saw in me potential to be fulfilled when I was doing my rotations during my first semester at UMD and invited me to join the amazing life-saving project that is BHB/M. A great deal of gratitude also goes to my Doctoral Committee members: Dr. Grant Anderson, Dr. Greg Beilman, and Dr. Ron Regal. All <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversations,</b> emails, and meetings have been invaluable towards my learning and growth. None of the work presented here would have been possible without suppor...|$|R
40|$|The walking group came {{together}} through a simple invitation to walk within a marked boundary, drawn by Abbey Lopez and Alison Barnes. The boundary encircled the Queen Victoria Market in Melbourne, {{which was an}} intended destination for lunch the previous day (but it was closed). Without any definite plans other than walking and immersing ourselves in this encounter and experience, six people gathered – Katherine Moline, Oliver Vodeb, Jeremy Yuille, Abbey Lopez, Alison Barnes and Yoko Akama. We walked, sometimes together, and sometimes alone. The themes of empathy, privilege, temporality and uncertainty surfaced in the periphery <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversations,</b> thoughts and image-making. Traces of these are captured in the following pages...|$|R
60|$|At her entry {{the whole}} <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversation,</b> as it hung about in Mrs Bowater's firelit little parlour, {{seemed to have}} become threadbare and meaningless. My visitor and I turned {{away from each other}} almost with relief--like Longfellow's shipwrecked sailors, perhaps, at sight of a ship.|$|E
6000|$|... "It wasn't to {{tell you}} so that I wanted to see you," [...] I replied; [...] "for {{it seemed to me}} that such a {{communication}} would rest wholly with herself. If however she did speak to you <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> she probably told you I was discouraging." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I am," [...] he admitted, {{feeling his}} sleeve, [...] "but {{to tell you}} the truth, in the {{interest}} <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversation</b> I had quite forgotten it. Here come our guests, before I have had time to escape. I can hear your friend Lessingham's voice." ...|$|E
60|$|Although, therefore, {{we could}} now manage our sails easily, we {{nevertheless}} found that my pulleys were of much service {{to us in}} some things, though Jack did laugh heartily at the uncouth arrangement of ropes and blocks, which had, to a sailor's eye, a very lumbering and clumsy appearance. But I will not drag my reader through {{the details of this}} voyage. Suffice it to say that, after an agreeable sail of about three weeks, we arrived off the island of Mango, which I recognised at once from the description that the pirate Bill had given me of it during one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>conversations.</b>|$|R
60|$|And {{with that}} we began one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> interminable <b>conversations,</b> one <b>of</b> those long, wandering, {{intensely}} generalizing, diffusely personal talks {{that will be}} dear to the hearts of intelligent youths until the world comes to an end. The Change has not abolished that, anyhow.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is probable," [...] said Miss B., [...] "that {{a greater}} part <b>of</b> <b>our</b> {{ordinary}} <b>conversation</b> {{had better be}} dispensed with. 'In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin.' For my own part, my conscience often reproaches me with the sins of my tongue." ...|$|R
