40|$|AbstractIn {{the current}} {{economic}} context countries are exposed to long-term structural shifts that challenge tourism development strategies and range from destination marketing to product offerings and infrastructure planning. In emerging countries, domestic and regional travel represents a highly promising tourism market in its nascent stage; even {{it has not yet}} reached significant volume because of low average levels of disposable income. However, domestic travel can mean a massive volume of tourist activity (Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2011 - World Economic Forum). In this respect, in the present paper we aimed at carrying out a research on the European countries tourism competitiveness using statistical tools. Our analysis is based on the 14 pillars described in the Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2011 - World Economic Forum ([URL] competitiveness-report- 2011) taking into consideration only European countries. In order to see how the 14 pillars of the competitiveness index are grouping on the 27 EU countries and the <b>other</b> 15 <b>non-EU</b> <b>countries,</b> we used - separately for EU <b>countries</b> and <b>non-EU</b> <b>countries</b> – the principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation and Kaiser normalization, followed by hierarchical cluster analysis and then the k-means cluster analysis to view the countries clustering on the principal components resulted...|$|R
40|$|A popular view among economists, policymakers, and the media, is {{that the}} Maastricht Treaty and then Stability and Growth Pact have {{significantly}} impaired the ability of EU governments to conduct a stabilizing fiscal policy and to provide an adequate level of public infrastructure. In this paper, we investigate this view by estimating fiscal rules for the discretionary budget deficit over the period 1980 - 2002, using data on EMU countries and control groups of non-EMU EU <b>countries</b> and <b>other</b> <b>non-EU</b> OECD <b>countries.</b> We do not find much support for this view. In fact, we find that discretionary fiscal policy in EMU countries has become more countercyclical over time, following {{what appears to be}} a trend that affects other industrialized countries as well. Similarly, we find that the decline in public investment experienced over the last decade by EMU countries is part of a world-wide trend that started well before the Maastricht Treaty was signed. ...|$|R

50|$|The EU {{suggested}} {{following that}} {{by using a}} planned Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA), <b>other</b> <b>non-EU</b> <b>countries</b> may {{also be able to}} provide this certification. Non-EU countries were sceptical about implementation of this approach. This was the first formal introduction that non-EU countries received about the proposed certification procedures. The proposal drove many EU and non-EU organisations to active responses. At the outset, the EU's position was that only those organisations which were already involved in boat certification could be accepted as a certifier, according to the Recreational Craft Directive (RCD). Thus, for an organisation to become involved in certification activities, it must already have a marine certification program underway in Europe.|$|E
50|$|The Mixed Service Organisation (MSO) was a {{civilian}} {{arm of the}} British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) which employed displaced persons as drivers, clerks, mechanics and guards. Originally formed as Watchman and labour units {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the Second World War the MSO employed citizens of Eastern European nations occupied by the Soviets. These former prisoners of war, concentration camp inmates and forced labourers were left in western sectors of occupied Germany at the end of the war and chose not to return to their countries of origin. Whilst some displaced persons only worked with the organisation for a short time others stayed until retirement age. The MSO was organised in a structure similar to British Colonial Units, with a British Commanding Officer and senior Non-commissioned officers operating over a 'native' officer and NCO structure. Whilst the Transport Service was disbanded in the late 1980s the MSO Guard and Labour Services continued into the 1990s using guest labour from Turkey, Pakistan and <b>other</b> <b>Non-EU</b> <b>Countries.</b>|$|E
40|$|End of Project ReportThis paper {{examines}} {{the competitiveness of}} Irish agriculture {{compared to that of}} <b>other</b> EU and <b>non-EU</b> <b>countries.</b> The analysis was based on two main data sources – the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) for years 1996 - 2003 and the International Farm Comparisons Network (IFCN) for 2003 for beef production and for 2004 for milk production. Results showed that the Irish competitive position compared to <b>other</b> EU and <b>non-EU</b> <b>countries</b> was positive when total cash costs were considered indicating a positive outlook for Irish milk production in the short to medium term. However, as the opportunity costs of owned resources are not included in ‘cash cost’ calculations, total economic costs which include imputed charges for owned resources were considered to examine the longer term outlook for the competitiveness of the sector. Using this measure, the competitive ranking for Irish agriculture slipped relative to the other countries. It was found that the main reason for the relatively high economic costs on Irish farms was due to the high imputed land and labour costs. These findings could be considered as a warning signal for the future competitive performance for the average sized Irish farm. However, based on FADN data the competitive position of ‘larger’ Irish dairy farms (in the 50 - 99 dairy cow size category) did manage to maintain their competitive position within Europe even when total economic costs were considered. Hence, it could be concluded that part of the explanation of the deterioration of competitive ranking for the average Irish dairy farm when total economic costs are considered relates to the relatively low scale of primary agricultural activity in Ireland during this period...|$|R
30|$|Elimination of {{subsidies}} is the initial step for establishing {{the level of}} emissions at the “socially optimal level” with the subsequent implementation of carbon pricing policies aiming to internalize externalities (World Bank [1997]). However, in situations when energy prices simply do not reflect opportunity costs or long-run marginal production costs in developing countries and economies in transition, phasing out energy subsidies alone could be perceived as effective climate mitigation policy. Since energy consumption and GHG emissions are intrinsically coupled, a price-induced decrease of energy use would eventually result in reduction of GHG emissions. For example, Burniaux et al. ([2009]) estimated using the OECD ENV-Linkages model that gradual elimination {{of subsidies}} over the period from 2013 to 2020 (assuming no other mitigation policies are taken) {{would result in a}} ∼ 20 % reduction in CO 2 emissions in Russia and <b>other</b> <b>non-EU</b> Eastern European <b>countries.</b>|$|R

40|$|The main {{topic of}} the thesis is the Common Commercial Policy of European Union {{that began with the}} {{liberalization}} of internal trade and the integration of the foreign trade of the member states. It describes historical process of trade policy's development along with the actual problems. This part is explaining why the Common Commercial Policy is so meaningful nowadays. Very important part of the thesis is dedicated to the common rules, which EU uses not only in its internal trade, but also in foreign trade with third states. Next part describes trade relations of EU based on agreements between the Community and <b>other</b> <b>non-EU</b> <b>countries</b> or international organizations. The agreement can be based on bilateral relations between the EU and trade partners or in form of multilateral relations under WTO. Special attention must be paid to the actual trade relations between the Community and Russia, while the importance of Russian Federation in international relations constantly rises. Before understanding the role of Russia for the EU is very important to look at the position of Russian in the world economy and its perspectives in the future. The thesis describes economic, political and trade relations between the EU and Russian federation from the period of its rise up to date.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} knowledge of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and condom use in a population of young female street sex workers from eastern Europe and <b>other</b> <b>non-EU</b> <b>countries</b> based in the Padua area (north-eastern Italy). To assess whether any aspects of their behavior might foster the spread of STDs. STUDY DESIGN: Street sex workers (prostitutes) were approached on the streets or during non-STD medical appointments, their knowledge of STDs and condom use were evaluated. They were asked to answer an anonymous questionnaire comprising 16 questions. RESULTS: 98 of them cooperated. Over one third of the sample frequently did not use a condom. This finding was inversely correlated with their age and educational level. Almost all the street sex workers were aware of AIDS but far less of other STDs. Most were almost totally unacquainted with some of them. We found a statistically significant correlation between condom use and their age, and between condom use and educational level. CONCLUSIONS: Sex workers often engaged in unprotected intercourse with clients, they practiced their profession even in the presence of STD-related symptoms and did not use a condom during intercourse with non-paying partners or pimps. The irresponsible behavior of some Italian paying partners prepared to pay extra for unprotected sex, increases the risk of acquiring STDs. The intercourse with female street sex workers can be considered a risk behavior for contracting STDs...|$|E
40|$|The {{engagement}} of JRC IPTS in the GTAP contributing {{team to the}} EU domestic support has opened up the opportunity to use the CATS database when compiling EU domestic support payments by member state, which are subsequently calibrated into the GTAP database. To maintain consistency, the GTAP version 9 includes EU domestic support which follows the approach adopted in the previous releases (Jensen, 2009, 2010). The difference is for pillar 1 support for which the CATS data are used (in previous GTAP database releases, pillar 1 support was based on EAGF financial reports). All together EU domestic support amounts to 66, 530 million euros in 2011 (i. e. pillar 1 expenditures from CATS, pillar 2 and national expenditures from Producer Support Estimate (PSE) by OECD). In addition, minor improvements to the allocation of payments have been proposed for the version 9 release. On the other hand previous research at JRC IPTS (Boulanger and Philippidis, 2014, 2015) showed that when comparing with the CATS database, the GTAP database was incomplete, particularly in its representation of CAP rural development payments, or so called pillar 2 payments. This paper compares the EU domestic support approach adopted in the GTAP database version 9 with an alternative one {{in order to make}} the representation of CAP expenditures more transparent and comprehensive. Such an alternative allocation includes more payments than the traditional method employed (e. g. the proposed classification includes support currently defined as General Services Support Estimate (GSSE) by the OECD). Finally, introducing this new accounting convention for the EU domestic support in the GTAP database would lead to data discrepancies with <b>other</b> <b>non-EU</b> <b>countries</b> and/or regions, jeopardising robust comparative analysi...|$|E
