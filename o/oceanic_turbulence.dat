Here {{we consider the}} case of a freely evolving, initially surface-intensified velocity field above a topographic bump, and show that the self-organization into a bottom-trapped current can result from its turbulent dynamics. Using equilibrium statistical mechanics, we explain this phenomenon as the most probable outcome of turbulent stirring. We compute explicitly a class of solutions characterized by a linear relation between potential vorticity and streamfunction, and predict when the bottom intensification is expected. Using direct numerical simulations, we provide an illustration of this phenomenon that agrees qualitatively with theory, although the ergodicity hypothesis is not strictly fulfilled...|$|R
40|$|International audienceReview {{of three}} studies {{devoted to the}} {{available}} potential energy (APE) leads to the proposal of a diagnosis for APE, well-suited for rotating stratified flows within the primitive equations (PE) framework in which anharmonic effects (due to large vertical displacements of isopycnals) are permitted. The chosen diagnosis {{is based on the}} APE definition of Holliday & McIntyre (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 107, 1981, pp. 221 – 225) and uses the background stratification of Winters et al. (J.

Subsequent evaluation of the APE in a PE direct simulation (1 / 100 °, 200 levels) of <b>oceanic</b> mesoscale <b>turbulence</b> indicates that anharmonic effects are significant.

Based on the previously developed knowledge of beam spreading of a partially coherent beam in the atmosphere and the spatial power spectrum of the refractive index of ocean water, we study the normalized root-mean-square width of a partially coherent beam on propagation through <b>oceanic</b> <b>turbulence</b> and its turbulence distance which may be a measure of turbulence resistance. Our analysis indicates that the behaviour of partially coherent beams on propagation may be described by the rate of dissipation of the mean-squared temperature chi(T) and that of salinity chi(S). In terms of a quantity w that defines {{the contributions of the}} temperature and salinity distributions to the distribution of the refractive index, chi(S) could be written as a function of chi(T) and w. Therefore, the behaviour of partially coherent beams on propagation can be characterized only by chi(T) for a given w. The results are shown for curved surfaces, from which one can see that partially coherent beams exhibit robust turbulence resistance when the water volume has a smaller chi(T) ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is crucial}} to {{understand}} the extreme intermittency of ocean and lake turbulence and turbulent mixing in order to estimate vertical fluxes of momentum, heat and mass by Osborn-Cox flux-dissipation methods. Vast undersampling errors occur by this method when intermittency is not taken into account. <b>Oceanic</b> <b>turbulence</b> increases intermittency {{as the result of}} a self-similar nonlinear cascade covering a wide range of scales, mostly horizontal. Extremely large intermittency factors Ie and Ic measured for Galactic and <b>oceanic</b> <b>turbulence</b> are in the range 3 - 7. These values are consistent with the third universal similarity hypothesis for turbulence of Kolmogorov (1962) and a length scale range over 3 - 7 decades from viscous or diffusive to buoyancy or Coriolis force domination, where the measured universal intermittency constant m_u = 0. 44, Gibson (1991 a), is a result of singularities in multifractal turbulence dissipation networks and their degeneration, Bershadskii and Gibson (1994).

(2011, 2013) {{showed that}} the {{application}} of Thorpe sorting on verticalprofiles of dry or moist potential temperatures estimated from Vaisala (RS 92 G) balloon datamakes it possible to identify turbulent layers or patches in the troposphere. The Thorpeprocessing provides a turbulence length scale, the so-called Thorpe length, found to be closelyrelated to outer scales of turbulence according to studies for <b>oceanic</b> <b>turbulence</b> (e. g., Dillon, 1982). The deepest layers, detected from balloon data, can be monitored by the Middle andUpper atmosphere radar (MUR) in range imaging mode so that additional information on thecharacteristics of the layers can be obtained. In addition, Wilson et al. (2014) showed thatbuoyancy and Ozmidov scales of turbulence (and energetic parameters such as energydissipation rates and diffusion coefficients) can be retrieved from the width of Doppler spectra(after careful removal of the non turbulent contributions) and the local stability N 2 providedby the sorted potential temperature profiles.

40|$|Observed {{phytoplankton}} interannual variability {{has been}} commonly related to atmospheric variables and climate indices.

We used a 1 / 54 degrees idealized biogeochemical model with a seasonally repeating atmospheric forcing such {{that there was no}} external source of interannual variability. At the scale of moorings, our experiment suggested that internal variability was responsible for interannual fluctuations of the subpolar phytoplankton bloom reaching 80 % in amplitude and 2 weeks in timing. Over broader scales, the largest impact occurred in the subtropics with interannual variations of 20 % in new production. The full strength of this variability could not be captured with the same model run at coarser resolution, suggesting that submesoscale resolving models are needed to fully disentangle the major drivers of biogeochemical variability at interannual time scales...|$|R
40|$|Waves in {{open ocean}} are modeled by Gaussian seas, as the linear {{superimposition}} {{of a very}} large number of elementary waves having amplitudes related to a given spectrum and random phases. If the elementary waves nonlinearly interact among them exchanging energy by resonance interaction, then the dynamics of the wave field is governed by the well known Zakharov equation for wave turbulence (Zakharov 1999). In the context of Gaussian seas, it is well known that the occurrence of large waves is due to the dynamics of a stochastic wave group (Fedele 2006, Fedele & Tayfun 2006) whose structure is described by the space-time covariance of the sea surface (Lindgren, 1972; Boccotti 1989, 2000), with a Rayleigh-distributed amplitude (crest) h, in the limit h approaching infinity. Drawing on the theory of quasi-determinism of Boccotti (2000) and the regression approximation approach of Rychlik (1987), we derive under the same limit conditions, a new coherent structure consisting of a large stochastic wave group of O(h), evolving non-interactively in the presence of a finite random background of O(1). We then investigate the nonlinear dynamics of this new wave structure in <b>oceanic</b> wave <b>turbulence</b> according to the Zakharov equation describing weakly nonlinear random seas...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a review of}} a ‘wirewalker’ underwater profiler that was used for high resolution water quality and turbulence measurements {{as part of a}} mid-Atlantic ocean based scientific survey. The profiler utilised wave energy and buoyancy to generate automated, cyclic underwater vertical measurements. A drifting supporting surface buoy and mooring configuration was used that moved horizontally in response to underwater currents, surface wind and waves, while generating repeated sub-surface vertical scientific measurements. The profiler instrumentation payload included a high-resolution chlorophyll-a fluorimeter, a fast sampling, precision conductivity, temperature and depth sensor (CTD) and a fragile, high resolution <b>oceanic</b> microstructure and <b>turbulence</b> sensor. A bespoke guard was used to help protect the fragile microstructure and turbulence sensors from damage. The mooring surface buoy instrumentation included telemetered GPS at nominally 30 minute intervals, a backup telemetered position indication, a VHF radio beacon based position locator and a solar powered night time light. The experiment was designed to resolve time-variability of upper-ocean mixing and chlorophyll-a fluorescence over the Mid-Atlantic underwater Ridge, an internal wave generation hotspot. Typically more than three wave driven descents to 200 metres and subsequent buoyancy driven ascents to close to the sea surface were achieved per hour during a 22 day deployment, whilst continuously sampling. This represents the first time the UK National Oceanography Centre (NOC) have used this type of underwater profiling system for high resolution <b>oceanic</b> microstructure and <b>turbulence</b> measurements to support a scientific campaign.

40|$|An {{instrument}} system {{was developed to}} measure <b>oceanic</b> <b>turbulence</b> from an underwater habitat in subarctic waters {{off the coast of}} Newfoundland. From a literature search of existing experimental techniques and instruments, it was seen that there was a large number of {{instrument system}}s capable of measuring turbulence, but that most were impractical without further development. After analyzing present instrument techniques, we chose DISA hot film anemometry equipment, and set up a three channel system for simultaneous three dimensional measurements. The instruments were operated from the habitat LORA 1 by SCUBA divers who also carried out Rhodamine B dye studies to delineate the turbulence. Difficulties with the two battery powered DISA anemometers subsequently reduced the system to one channel which used a DISA 55 D 01 anemometer with a conical probe. Two experiments were performed and preliminary analysis was presented to demonstrate the capability of the system. The data was compromised somewhat by problems associated with low mean velocities and oscillatory velocities from wave action, but spectral analysis showed the characteristic - 5 / 3 slope and gave viscous dissipations of about 5 x 10 ⁻³ cm²/sec³ with turbulence intensities about 0. 1. In one case, the turbulence was associated with a highly unusual oscillatory bottom current. In summary, with SCUBA divers to perform the experiments and with dye being used to delineate the water motion, DISA hot film equipment is entirely satisfactory for <b>oceanic</b> <b>turbulence</b> measurements...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using submarine-recorded acceleration and navigational data to detect deep convection {{in the ocean}} was explored by comparing actual submarine observations of vertical velocity with vertical velocity of a hypothetical submarine driven through a field of <b>oceanic</b> <b>turbulence</b> predicted by Large-Eddy Simulation (LES). The actual submarine data included time series of three-dimensional acceleration and submarine velocity from the inertial navigation system (INS), gravity and keel depth. Of all these fields, vertical velocity derived from the INS proved most useful for comparison with the simulated vertical velocity fields. The actual observations were analyzed {{as a function of}} submarine depth and speed. The spectral energy density was computed for several standard depths, with the largest vertical accelerations found for the times when the submarine was at the shallowest depths. Spectral shape also varied with depth, with the strongest high- frequency/wavenumber intensity for the shoalest cases. The submarine may have experienced a combination of surface gravity wave motion and mixed-layer turbulence in the shallowest case, but there was probably no significant oceanic convection at any of the other depths because of stability of the water column. Spectra of the hypothetical submarine transiting an LES-predicted field of turbulence were contrasted with the spectra of the observed vertical velocity. Although the observed signal's spectral intensity exceeded the spectral intensity for the highest frequency motions of the simulated turbulence, the LES-predicted convection intensity for scales greater than 4 OOm was significantly greater than the corresponding signal obtained for the submarine during times when the submarine was not encountering <b>oceanic</b> <b>turbulence.</b> U.

40|$|Abstract. Gravity {{waves on}} the sea surface reflect {{coupling}} between the atmo-sphere and ocean. They play important dynamical roles in the transfer of momen-tum, heat, and scalars, but how they interact with background <b>oceanic</b> (and atmo-spheric) <b>turbulence</b> is still not well understood. This is especially true under high winds where waves foster Langmuir circulations but also break intermittently. Results from high-resolution large eddy simulations (LESs) that include stochas-tic breaking waves and the Craik-Leibovich “vortex force ” are analyzed. Under certain sea states turbulence (anisotropic seed vorticity) generated by breaking waves initiates Craik-Leibovich instabilities that lead to coherent structures, viz., Langmuir cells and intermittent downwelling jets both of which impact ocean mixing. We suggest a mechanism as to how breaking waves couple with the vortex force {{that leads to the}} formation of these flow structures. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{most obvious}} and most {{important}} difference between technological and environmental flows is the length scales which need to be represented in the simulations. Other essential differences are that, on the smallest scales of environmental flows, the effects of stratification must be included and, on the larger scales, rotation plays a dominant role and must be accounted for. Another essential difference is that for many environmental flows {{it is essential to}} make forecasts-detailed predictions of the actual state (i. e., a single realization) for some time in the future. Thus, two types of simulations are performed: actual forecasts and simulations designed to produce data that will help simplify and reduce the cost of making forecasts. Several examples of the latter type are given in this paper: stratified sheared homogeneous turbulence, oscillating grid <b>turbulence,</b> <b>oceanic</b> upwelling, and Langmuir cells.

40|$|International audienceAnalysis of {{satellite}} altimetry observations, transports estimates from a mooring array, {{as well as}} output from two different numerical ocean circulation models (ROMS and HYCOM), {{have been used to}} investigate the mesoscale eddy properties and transport variability in the Mozambique Channel. The power spectral density of model transports at 17 °S indicates the models ability to represent the transport variability at mesoscale frequencies (range between 3 yr− 1 and 10 yr− 1). The models have shown an exaggerated representation of the lower frequencies (~ 10 yr− 1). The overestimation of the seasonal cycle appears in our case not to be related to a misrepresentation of the mesoscale variability. The eddies were identified using an automatic eddy tracking scheme. Both anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies appeared to have a preferred site of formation within the channel. The density distribution showed that the anticyclones exhibited a bi-modal distribution: the first mode was associated with the typical scale for the <b>oceanic</b> mesoscale <b>turbulence,</b> while the second mode was related to the passage of large rings at a frequency of about 4 – 7 per year. On the other hand, cyclonic eddies had a single mode distribution that follows the first baroclinic Rossby radius of deformation, which is a typical scale for the oceanic mesoscale surface eddy variability, suggesting that their formation is associated with baroclinic instability. Eddy mean amplitudes per class of radius (< 100 km), increase linearly with increasing radius, while no linear relationship exists for the rings. Different from the rings, the increase in the amplitude of the eddies was consistent with the increase of their life expectancy and travelling distances...|$|R

40|$|Velocity {{time series}} from surface drifter data are {{exploited}} {{in a novel}} way to study the Southern Ocean surface circulation response to wind forcing. The ageostrophic component of the drifter velocities at 15 m is approximated by subtracting altimeter-derived geostrophic velocities from the drifter velocities. The resultant ageostrophic velocity time series are studied in the frequency domain jointly with contemporaneous time series of local wind stress from atmospheric reanalysis data. Rotary spectral analysis indicates that both wind stresses and ocean velocities are predominantly anticyclonic. Cross-spectral analysis shows that the upper ocean responds preferentially to anticyclonic winds {{not only at the}} inertial frequency but also at subinertial frequencies. The phase of the cross-spectra which is interpreted as a geometric angle indicates that the component of velocity that is coherent with the wind stress is {{to the left of the}} wind at subinertial frequencies and to the right at supra-inertial frequencies, and is seen as evidence of Ekman-type currents. A first order closure of the <b>oceanic</b> vertical <b>turbulence,</b> where the <b>oceanic</b> stress is equal to a viscosity coefficient K times the velocity vertical shear, is used to interpret the cross-spectrum. In this framework, the real part of the cross-spectrum of the wind stress and ocean surface ageostrophic velocity is shown to be a measure of the wind energy input rate to the Ekman layer. This energy input is therefore estimated across the Southern Ocean. The observed transfer function, which is the cross-spectrum divided by the auto-spectrum of the wind stress, is compared to the theoretical transfer functions arising from 10 different Ekman-type boundary layer models. These models differ in the dependence of K on the vertical coordinate and in the bottom boundary condition. The most dynamically consistent model has a vertical viscosity that is finite at the surface and increases linearly to the bottom of the boundary layer depth.

40|$|The higher-order {{structure}} {{functions of}} vertical velocity fluctuations (transverse structure functions (TSF)) {{were employed to}} study the characteristics of turbulence intermittency in a reversing tidal flow on a 19 m deep shallow shelf of the East China Sea. Measurements from a downward-looking, bottom-mounted Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter, positioned 0. 45 m above the seafloor, which spanned two semidiurnal tidal cycles, were analyzed. A classical lognormal single-parameter (mu) model for intermittency and the universal multifractal approach (specifically, the two-parameter (C- 1 and alpha) log-Levy model) were employed to analyze the TSF exponent xi(q) in tidally driven turbulent boundary layer and to estimate mu, C- 1, and alpha. During the energetic flooding tidal phases, the parameters of intermittency models approached the mean values of (mu) over tilde approximate to 0. 24, (C) over tilde (1) approximate to 0. 15, and (alpha) over tilde approximate to 1. 5, which are accepted as the universal values for fully developed turbulence at high Reynolds numbers. With the decrease of advection velocity, mu and C- 1 increased up to mu approximate to 0. 5 - 0. 6 and C- 1 approximate to 0. 25 - 0. 35, but a decreased to about 1. 4. The results explain the reported disparities between the smaller "universal" values of intermittency parameters mu and C- 1 (mostly measured in laboratory and atmospheric high Reynolds number flows) and those (mu = 0. 4 - 0. 5) reported for <b>oceanic</b> stratified <b>turbulence</b> in the pycnocline, which is associated with relatively low local Reynolds numbers R-lambda w. The scaling exponents xi(2) of the second-order TSF, relative to the third-order structure function, was also {{found to be a}} decreasing function of R-lambda w, approaching the classical value of 2 / 3 only at very high R-lambda w. A larger departure from the universal turbulent regime at lower Reynolds numbers could be attributed to the higher anisotropy and associated intermittency of underdeveloped turbulence. U. S.

40|$|Abstract. Thin sea ice plays {{a central}} role in the surface heat and mass balance of the Arctic Ocean. In order to develop {{understanding}} of these balances we describe and analyze highly resolved temperature data taken through the air/sea/ice interface during the transition from an ice-free to an ice-covered Arctic Ocean surface. The data were taken to observe the thermodynamic evolution of a lead, a process that has previously only been accessible to measurement techniques confined to the lead edge. Our detailed analysis of the field data is guided by recent theoretical and experimental advances in understanding the phase dynamics of directionally solidified alloys. Because of the dearth of direct observations we also present time series of the relevant heat fluxes inferred from our data and demonstrate the controlling influence that the internal phase evolution has on these quantities. We have previously examined the stability of the brine trapped in a growing sea ice matrix both theoretically and experimentally and now find that haline convection, driven from within the growing layer, is consistent with this previous work and with the nature of direct turbulence measurements. The importance of this process is that although ice growth is continuous, the local brine flux commences abruptly, only after some time, in contrast to what had previously been supposed. Hence the ice growth process itself is a source of intermittency in <b>oceanic</b> boundary layer <b>turbulence.</b> Furthermore, we find that in this particular situation the sea ice growth is not simply a square root function of time, in contrast to the model typically used in numerical simulations. By far the most practical methods of studying lead convection are numerical simulations and laboratory models, and a strong conclusion of this study is the importance of the proper treatment of the boundary conditions describing the buoyancy flux. 1...|$|R

To remove this bias, a modified structure function methodology is developed that exploits the differing length scale dependencies of the contributions to the structure function resulting from turbulent and wave orbital motions.

40|$|Vertical mixing, {{driven by}} {{turbulence}} in the ocean, underpins {{many of the}} critical interactions that allow life on earth to flourish since vertical buoyancy flux maintains global overturning circulation and vertical nutrient fluxes are critical to primary production. Prediction of the ocean system is therefore dependent on accurate simulation of turbulent processes that, by their very nature, are chaotic. A growing evidence base exists that provides insight into these complex processes and permits investigation of turbulence relative to better determined, and therefore predictable, parameters.

40|$|A {{reexamination of}} {{turbulence}} dissipation measurements from the equatorial Pacific {{shows that the}} turbulence diffusivities are not a simple function of the gradient Richardson number. A widely used mixing scheme, the K-profile parameterization, overpredicts the turbulent vertical heat flux by roughly a factor of 4 in the stably stratified region between the surface mixed layer and the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC). Additionally, the heat flux divergence is of the incorrect sign in the upper 80 m. An alternative class of parameterizations is examined that expresses the mixing coefficients {{in terms of the}} large-scale kinetic energy, shear, and Richardson number. These representations collapse the turbulence diffusivities above and below the Equatorial Undercurrent, and a tuned version is able to reproduce the vertical turbulence heat flux within the 50 – 180 -m depth range. Kinetic energy is not Galilean invariant, so the collapse of the data with the new parameterization suggests that <b>oceanic</b> <b>turbulence</b> responds to boundary forcing at depths well below the surface mixed layer...|$|E

In order to improve the understanding and characterization of the diffusion of copepods within an heterogeneous phytoplankton field, we developed a model based on particle diffusion in a multifractal field. After discussing this model with some detail, we used it and the corresponding numerical simulations in order to investigate the fundamental question: does the strong heterogeneity of the phytoplankton generate a anomalous diffusion of the copepods?

The range of horizontal scales actually probed by three different acoustic sources {{is found to be}} directly linked to their frequency content. The horizontal inertial range with a spectral slope of k(h) (- 5 / 3) extend up to 3 km wavelength for the most intense acoustic reflectors which surround strong anticyclonic eddies. The in situ data analysis is confirmed by high resolution numerical simulations of oceanic anticyclonic vortices, in a rotating temperature-stratified fluid (no salt), which show the spontaneous emergence of a concentration of acoustic reflectors above and below the eddy. These show an anisotropy and a spectral slope consistent with the framework of stratified turbulence, which differs from that of Garret and Munk for internal waves. The implications are that a direct energy cascade to smaller spatial scales is occurring at the boundaries of energetic oceanic vortices and may provide a mechanism to drive mixing in the ocean interio...|$|E
40|$|A {{package of}} {{software}} computes the time-dependent propagation {{of a narrow}} laser beam in an arbitrary three- dimensional (3 D) medium with absorption and scattering, using the transient-discrete-ordinates method and a direct integration method. Unlike prior software that utilizes a Monte Carlo method, this software enables simulation at very small signal-to-noise ratios. The ability to simulate propagation of a narrow laser beam in a 3 D medium is an improvement over other discrete-ordinate software. Unlike other direct-integration software, this software {{is not limited to}} simulation of propagation of thermal radiation with broad angular spread in three dimensions or of a laser pulse with narrow angular spread in two dimensions. Uses for this software include (1) computing scattering of a pulsed laser beam on a material having given elastic scattering and absorption profiles, and (2) evaluating concepts for laser-based instruments for sensing <b>oceanic</b> <b>turbulence</b> and related measurements of oceanic mixed-layer depths. With suitable augmentation, this software could be used to compute radiative transfer in ultrasound imaging in biological tissues, radiative transfer in the upper Earth crust for oil exploration, and propagation of laser pulses in telecommunication applications...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the {{observed}} zonally averaged jet in the Northern Hemisphere atmosphere exhibits two spatial patterns with broadband variability in the decadal and inter-decadal range; these patterns are consistent with an important role of local, mid-latitude ocean&ndash;atmosphere coupling. A key aspect of this behaviour is the fundamentally nonlinear bi-stability of the atmospheric jet's latitudinal position, which enables relatively small sea-surface temperature anomalies associated with ocean processes to affect the large-scale atmospheric winds. The wind anomalies induce, in turn, complex three-dimensional anomalies in the ocean's main thermocline; in particular, they {{may be responsible for}} recently reported cooling of the upper ocean. Both observed modes of variability, decadal and inter-decadal, have been found in our intermediate climate models. One mode resembles North Atlantic tri-polar sea-surface temperature (SST) patterns described elsewhere. The other mode, with mono-polar SST pattern, is novel; its key aspects include interaction of <b>oceanic</b> <b>turbulence</b> with the large-scale oceanic flow. To the extent these anomalies exist, the interpretation of observed climate variability in terms of natural and human-induced changes will be affected. Coupled mid-latitude ocean-atmosphere modes do, however, suggest some degree of predictability is possible...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims at {{analysing}} {{the impact}} of <b>oceanic</b> <b>turbulence</b> and air-sea interactions on the sea surface temperature (SST) of the extra-tropical oceans on spatial scales {{of a few hundred}} kilometres (the so-called "mesoscale"). Using satellite-based measurements of SST and sea level, as well as surface tracks of mesoscale oceanic cyclones and anticyclones, it is shown that turbulence does not transport heat through systematic motions of cold cyclones and warm anticyclones, as was previously thought in regions of strong mean flows like the Gulf Stream. Rather, it is suggested that heat is transported {{as a result of the}} slight phase shift between temperature and pressure fluctuations developing on the mean flow. In addition, tentative estimates of the rate at which air-sea heat fluxes damp the SST signatures of cyclones and anticyclones are provided. The weak values obtained (20 W/m 2 K) contrast sharply with theoretical expectations, but are in agreement with the observed long-lived thermal heat content anomalies associated with the cyclones and anticyclones. These observations provide important benchmarks for high-resolution ocean models and may moreover guide the parametrization of subgrid-scale heat transport in climate models.
