5|$|At times Shelley {{had trouble}} finding {{sufficient}} research materials {{and had to}} make do with fewer resources than she would have liked, particularly for the Spanish and Portuguese Lives. She wrote in a style that combined secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, and her own opinions. Her political views are most <b>obvious</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E
5|$|Because WALL-E overtly critiques consumerism, it also critiques Disney's {{production}} {{values and}} aesthetic, without being too <b>obvious.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> DVD commentary, Stanton {{said that he}} has been asked if it was his intention to make a movie about consumerism. His answer was it was not; {{it was a way to}} answer the question of how would the Earth get to the state where one robot would be left to continue the cleanup by itself.|$|E
5|$|Folkloric vampirism {{has been}} {{associated}} with clusters of deaths from unidentifiable or mysterious illnesses, usually within the same family or the same small community. The epidemic allusion is <b>obvious</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classical cases of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole, and even more so in the case of Mercy Brown and in the vampire beliefs of New England generally, where a specific disease, tuberculosis, was associated with outbreaks of vampirism. As with the pneumonic form of bubonic plague, it was associated with breakdown of lung tissue which would cause blood to appear at the lips.|$|E

5|$|Sawtooth National Forest has {{a history}} of alpine {{glaciation}} that is most <b>obvious</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sawtooth Mountains, and while no surface glaciers exist today, perennial snow fields and rock glaciers remain, usually on north or east facing slopes. There have been 202 perennial snow fields mapped in the Sawtooth Mountains, and while none have been mapped elsewhere on the forest, some may still exist in the Boulder, Pioneer, and White Cloud Mountains.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most <b>obvious</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> figure of the Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, Prussian blue, vermilion of mercury, and crystals of powdered glass, orpiment and iron oxides. He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates {{that most of the}} Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.|$|E
5|$|During the offseason, Ulis wore {{a walking}} boot {{on his right}} foot {{following}} a pick-up game injury for precautionary reasons. Ulis was also named to the 36-man 201415 Bob Cousy Award Preseason Watch List and the Wayman Tisdale Award Watch List. Ulis quickly {{earned a reputation as}} a difference maker whose contributions may not be <b>obvious</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> statistics. On December 10, he was sidelined with an injury. Ulis posted a season-high 14 points on December 27 against Louisville in the Kentucky–Louisville rivalry game known as the Battle For The Bluegrass, earning the MVP of the game from the Bluegrass Sports Commission. On December 29, his effort was recognized with an SEC Freshman of the Week honor. Ulis did not start in any his 37 games played as a freshman, but averaged 23.8 minutes played. Following the season, he was named to the 8-man 2015 SEC All-Freshman Team. Kentucky went undefeated in its first 38 games before losing to Wisconsin in the Final Four of the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Ulis led the team in assists per game.|$|E

30|$|There was no <b>obvious</b> {{hemorrhage}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cortex {{of brain}} when the impact velocity {{was less than}} 3000  m/s; however, when the velocity reached 4000  m/s, there was <b>obvious</b> hemorrhage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cerebral cortex (Fig.  1 c). Microscopy revealed a vein <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sulcus that had ruptured and caused the subarachnoid hemorrhage (Fig.  1 d). As observed under the light microscope, there was a clearly ruptured microvessel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thalamus after a 3000  m/s impact, and the blood–brain barrier was destroyed, {{as evidenced by the}} extravasation of red cells and serum (Fig.  1 e).|$|R
5|$|Earlier restorations had {{all left}} their {{marks on the}} frescoes. To {{counteract}} the whitening caused by salination, animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most <b>obvious</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> small putti which hold the nameplates on the pendentives, was saltpetre seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface. Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. This was particularly {{the case for the}} lunettes, spandrels and lower parts of the pendentives.|$|E
5|$|The fruiting {{body has}} a convex-shaped cap, at first small in {{relation}} to its stipe, expanding in volume as it matures. The skin of the cap is dry, matte and can be coloured from maroon to chocolate brown with a reddish tint. These characteristics distinguish it visually from relatives such as Boletus edulis, Boletus reticulatus and Boletus aereus. The young, immature cap may have a pale pink colour and a white, powdery flush. Measuring 410cm (1.64 in) tall by 38 (1.22.2in) cm wide, the bulbous stipe is often large, swollen and imposing, bearing a network. The overall colour may have an orange-red tinge which is more <b>obvious</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lowest parts, although this is also common in other species. As with all boletes, {{the size of the}} fruiting body can be very variable. The cap diameter can be as much as 30cm (12in) and stem height 15cm (6in).|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} very similar in {{appearance}} to the Fea's petrel, but is smaller. The size difference and lighter flight may not be apparent at sea, especially with lone birds, but a recent study helped to clarify other useful features. Zino's has a diagnostically small, delicate, often rather long and slender bill, which may be <b>obvious</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most slender-billed examples, which are probably mostly females, but {{can be difficult to}} determine in larger-billed, probably adult male, birds. Another useful feature is a large whitish panel on the underwing. The wing panel is exclusive to Zino's but is only shown by 15% of the birds. Zino's has a more rounded wing tip, but P. feae deserti sometimes shows a rounded wing tip, so this feature is not diagnostic. Previously suggested criteria such as head, upperwing and flank patterns were found to be inconclusive. Off the eastern United States and the Azores, both Macronesian petrels are easily distinguished from the larger Bermuda petrel by that species' upperparts, which are uniformly dark but for a pale grey rump.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{characters}} from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film. V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern {{over the loss of}} innocent life. However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Evey Hammond's transformation as V's protégée is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. At the beginning of the film, she is already a confident woman with a hint of rebellion in her; in the graphic novel, she starts off as an insecure, desperate young woman forced into prostitution. V and Evey's relationship, though not as <b>obvious</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book, ends in the film with pledges of love. In the graphic novel's finale, she not only carries out V's plans as she does in the film, but also clearly takes on V's identity. In the film, Inspector Finch sympathizes with V, but, in the graphic novel, he is determined to stop V and goes as far as taking LSD to enter into a criminal's state of mind. Gordon, a very minor character in both adaptations, is also drastically changed. In the novel, Gordon is a small-time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street. The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang. In the film, however, Gordon is a well-mannered colleague of Evey's, and is later revealed to be gay. He is arrested by fingermen for broadcasting a political parody on his TV program, and is later executed when a Quran is found in his possession.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{anatomical}} {{comparison of}} {{structures in the}} embryos {{of two or more}} species provides evidence for a shared ancestor that may not be <b>obvious</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> adult forms. As the embryo develops, these homologies can be lost to view, and the structures can take on different functions. Part of the basis of classifying the vertebrate group (which includes humans), is the presence of a tail (extending beyond the anus) and pharyngeal slits. Both structures appear during some stage of embryonic development but are not always <b>obvious</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> adult form.|$|E
