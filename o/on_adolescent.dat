Research showed that teens who viewed high levels of sexual content were twice as likely to get pregnant within three years compared to those teens who were not exposed to as much sexual content.

25|$|The social constructionist {{perspective}} (see social constructionism for {{a general}} definition) <b>on</b> <b>adolescent</b> sexuality examines how power, culture, meaning and gender interact to affect the sexualities of adolescents.

25|$|In the Kids {{for cash}} scandal, judge Mark Ciavarella, who {{promoted}} {{a platform of}} zero tolerance, received kickbacks for constructing a private prison that housed juvenile offenders, and then proceeded to fill the prison by sentencing children to extended stays in juvenile detention for offenses as minimal as mocking a principal on Myspace, scuffles in hallways, trespassing in a vacant building, and shoplifting DVDs from Walmart. Critics of zero-tolerance policies argue that harsh punishments for minor offences are normalized. The documentary Kids for Cash interviews experts <b>on</b> <b>adolescent</b> behaviour, who argue that the zero tolerance model has become a dominant approach to policing juvenile offences after the Columbine shooting.|$|E

Therefore, an important question for educators is: how is technology affecting adolescents 2 ̆ 7 {{quality and quantity of}} sleep, their attention difficulties, and their academic performance? The purpose of the current project was to examine the relationships between adolescent self-reports of technology usage, sleep patterns, attention difficulties and academic achievement. Results indicated that nocturnal technology use has a negative impact <b>on</b> <b>adolescents</b> 2 ̆ 7 quality and quantity of sleep. Furthermore both technology use in general and reported attention difficulties have a negative impact <b>on</b> <b>adolescents</b> 2 ̆ 7 academic achievement. Finally, general technology use was not found to have a significant impact <b>on</b> <b>adolescents</b> 2 ̆ 7 academic achievement or reported sleep quantity.
