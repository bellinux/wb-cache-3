According to sol-gel properties changes, it was proposed that polybutadiene blocks undergo mainly crosslinking. However, these latter coexist with chain scissions occurring in polybutadiene blocks, which generates poly(butadiene-b-methyl methacrylate) and poly(butadiene-b-styrene) diblock chains, and possibly chain scissions occurring in polystyrene and poly(methyl methacylate) blocks.

40|$|LDL {{plays an}} {{important}} role in atherosclerotic plaque formation and macrophage differentiation. However, there is no report regarding the <b>oxidation</b> <b>degree</b> of LDL and macrophage differentiation. Our study has shown that the differentiation into M 1 or M 2 macrophages is related to the lipid oxidation level of LDL. Based on the level of lipid peroxidation, LDL is classified into high-oxidized LDL (hi-oxLDL) and low-oxidized LDL (low-oxLDL). The differentiation profiles of macrophages were determined by surface receptor expression and cytokine secretion profiles. Low-oxLDL induced CD 86 expression and production of TNF-α and IL- 12 p 40 in THP- 1 cells, indicating an M 1 macrophage phenotype. Hi-oxLDL induced mannose receptor expression and production of IL- 6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1, which mostly match the phenotype of M 2 macrophages. Further supporting evidence for an M 2 polarization by hi-oxLDL was the induction of LOX- 1 in THP- 1 cells treated with hi-oxLDL but not with low-oxLDL.
