The Ogle County Courthouse was designed by Chicago architect George O. Garnsey in the Romanesque Revival style of architecture. The ridged roof is dominated by its wooden cupola which stands out at a distance.|$|E

5|$|On 15 August 1998 the RIRA left a car {{containing}} 500lb of home-made explosives in {{the centre}} of Omagh, County Tyrone. The bombers {{could not find a}} parking space near the intended target <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse,</b> and the car was left 400 metres away. As a result, three inaccurate telephone warnings were issued, and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) believed the bomb was located outside the courthouse. They attempted to establish a security cordon to keep civilians clear of the area, which inadvertently pushed people closer to the location of the bomb. Shortly after, the bomb exploded killing 29 people and injuring 220 others, in what became the single deadliest strike of the Troubles.|$|E

The following personnel were elected to serve in leadership positions within the company: Parsons as its captain in command; John Blue, first lieutenant; and his son Isaac Parsons, Jr., second lieutenant. Parsons and his company utilized flintlock muskets, which they had retrieved from the loft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse,</b> and additional sabres and flintlock horse pistols which had last been used during the American Revolutionary War. Parsons provided Lt. Blue with a Minié ball rifle reportedly seized from John Brown at Harpers Ferry.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} again {{served as}} a library in March 1937, when Romney's community library was relocated {{to the first floor}} of Literary Hall from its previous facility {{in the basement of the}} Hampshire County Courthouse. The library had been established on April 11, 1935 as a project by the American Legion Auxiliary, and was housed in a room <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> basement where it was staffed by volunteers and open from 2pm to 4pm on Saturday afternoons. When the library's collection of both purchased and donated books outgrew its space in the courthouse basement, the Clinton Lodge Masons granted permission to the library to house its collection at Literary Hall in 1937. Following its move to Literary Hall, the library expanded its hours, and expanded them again, to five afternoons a week, through the assistance of the National Youth Administration and the Works Progress Administration.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} of St James' Church {{was commissioned by}} Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1819, designed by the convict architect Francis Greenway and constructed between 1820 and 1824 using convict labour. Governor Macquarie and Commissioner John Bigge laid the foundation stone on Thursday, 7 October 1819. The building was originally intended {{to serve as a}} courthouse as Macquarie had plans for a large cathedral to be built on the present location of St Andrew's Cathedral but they were put on hold by the intervention of Bigge who had been appointed to conduct a Royal Commission into the colonial government. Bigge initially approved <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> project but by February 1820, less than four months after his arrival, he strongly recommended its conversion into a church.|$|E
5|$|Danville's {{trustees}} also {{voted to}} give free use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> {{in the square}} {{to a group of}} Freemasons in 1817. The trustees sold another portion of the square near Main Street for the construction of private residences in 1823, and the Freemasons purchased the courthouse and the land it occupied in 1828. A group of Methodists purchased the land from the Freemasons in 1834, and they subsequently sold it to a Reverend Adams the following year. Adams purchased two adjacent plots and founded an all-female academy which ultimately failed. In 1854, the Danville Theological Seminary moved from the campus of Centre College to Constitution Square, occupying many of the buildings there. The brick courthouse became the main building of the seminary, and during the Civil War, it was used as a hospital to treat wounded soldiers both Union and Confederate {{in the aftermath of the}} Battle of Perryville. Danville Theological Seminary remained in operation until 1878. After its closure, the main building deteriorated and was eventually razed.|$|E
