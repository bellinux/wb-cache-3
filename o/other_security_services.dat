40|$|Abstract: Telecommunication {{increasingly}} {{influences the}} way we live, work, and socialize. Buzzword such as the Internet or broadband networking are omnipresent—so are reports of security breaches. Consequently, <b>security</b> <b>services</b> are indispensable to applications as divers as electronic commerce, linking company networks, telemedicine, and so forth. Whereas application built-in security is widely spread, such as the integration of cryptographic functions into email clients or Web browsers, the diversity of applications carried over public networks strives for concepts that view upon security {{as an integral part}} of the network protocol stack. In this paper, we present two standards that enable network built-in security services: On the one hand, Internet protocol (IP) security is discussed. On the <b>other</b> hand, <b>security</b> <b>services</b> in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks is addressed. The key concepts of both approaches are sketched and—although IP and ATM significantly differ—common aspects of IP security and ATM security are described...|$|R
40|$|The Service Location Protocol {{has been}} {{designed}} within the Internet Engineering Task Force {{to meet the needs}} of all Internet nodes for automatic resolution of service needs. The protocol defines User Agents, Service Agents, and Directory Agents, and the request and response messages between them. Provisions are made for interactive selection of services. Scalable operation is provided by eliminating most multicast and broadcast messages, and by a scoping mechanism useful for dividing up the administration of enterprise resources into separate domains. The distributed and non-hierarchical nature of the service agent registration leads to further reductions in the need for administration, and to greater availability to local user agents. <b>Security</b> <b>services</b> are defined within the protocol to work in conjunction with <b>other</b> standard <b>security</b> <b>services.</b> 1 Introduction The Service Location Protocol (SLP) [9, 3] {{has been designed}} to meet the need for automatic resolution of service needs in th [...] ...|$|R
