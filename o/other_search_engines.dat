On 6 November 2013 in Mosley v SARL Google a French court sided with Mosley and ordered Google to prevent its search engine from providing links to images of Mosley engaging in sexual activities from the video.

[...] See [...] for more details about the rewriting process. [...] This rewrite step is {{a signal to the}} web site to please provide a simple and full HTML web page that is the result of executing the AJAX or other scripting on the page.

2500|$|Google {{does not}} use HTML keyword or meta tag {{elements}} for indexing. The Director of Research at Google, Monika Henzinger, was quoted (in 2002) as saying, [...] "Currently we don't trust metadata because we are afraid of being manipulated." [...] <b>Other</b> <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> developed techniques to penalize Web sites considered to be [...] "cheating the system". For example, a Web site repeating the same meta keyword several times may have its ranking decreased by a search engine trying to eliminate this practice, though that is unlikely. It {{is more likely that}} a search engine will ignore the meta keyword element completely, and most do regardless of how many words are used in the element.|$|E
2500|$|Search engines {{also are}} able to retain user information, such as {{location}} and time spent using the search engine, for up to ninety days. Most search engine operators use the data {{to get a sense}} of which needs must be met in certain areas of their field. People working in the legal field are also allowed to use information collected from these search engine websites. The Google search engine is given as an example of a search engine that retains the information entered for a period of three-fourths of a year before it becomes obsolete for public usage. Yahoo! follows in the footsteps of Google in the sense that it also deletes user information after a period of ninety days. <b>Other</b> <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> such as Ask! search engine has promoted a tool of [...] "AskEraser" [...] which essentially takes away personal information when requested.|$|E

50|$|By sending {{multiple}} queries {{to several}} <b>other</b> <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> this extends the search {{coverage of the}} topic and allows more information to be found.
