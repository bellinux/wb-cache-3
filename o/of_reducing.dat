40|$|We {{explored}} the redox status of beta 2 glycoprotein I (β 2 GPI) in {{different stages of}} diabetic angiopathy. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) had a significantly lower proportion <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> β 2 GPI as compared to healthy controls (p 0. 05). The mild-A-stenosis group and mild-diabetic retinopathy (DR) groups had higher proportion <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> β 2 GPI than their severely affected counterparts. The mild-slow nerve conduction velocity (NCVS) group had higher proportion <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> β 2 GPI than normal nerve conduction velocity (NCVN group) and severe-NCVS groups. The proportion <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> β 2 GPI was in positive correlation with 24 [*]h urine microalbumin and total urine protein, and the proportion <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> β 2 GPI was in negative correlation with serum and skin advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Taken together, our data implicate that the proportion <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> β 2 GPI increased in the early stage of angiopathy and decreased with the aggravation of angiopathy...|$|R

40|$|Intensive corn {{cultivation}} is predominant {{in current}} agriculture of the Una-Sana Canton. One {{of the corn}} cultivation methods in agro-ecosystem is reduced cultivation. The paper presents the experiment of “Osmak žuti” (eight-row yellow) corn cultivation on two control sites with application <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> and intensive cultivation in Cazin municipality. The objectives of this research were to examine the possibility <b>of</b> application <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> corn cultivation; analyze statistical variation elements (length, circumference and weight of corn cob); and determine cost effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> relative to intensive production. The results indicate extremely high statistically significant difference (p< 0. 001) for all parameters in both cultivation methods. The cost effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> relative to intensive cultivation of Osmak žuti corn is higher by 36 %.

40|$|Atmospheric budgets <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> {{nitrogen}} for {{the major}} political regions of the British Isles are investigated with a multi-layer atmospheric transport model. The model is validated against measurements of NH 3 concentration and is developed to provide atmospheric budgets for defined subdomains of the British Isles. The study shows that NH 3 emissions, transport and deposition in a specific region can have profound effects on {{the composition of the}} atmosphere over other regions. An important feature is the high export <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> nitrogen from Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland to England and Scotland. England is also a net exporter <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> nitrogen. By contrast, Scotland and Wales are approximately "ammonia neutral" as import <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> nitrogen roughly balances export. Overall, only 7 % <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> nitrogen in the British Isles is derived from non-British Isles sources (29 kt N yr- 1), compared with emissions of 387 kt N yr- 1.

These microbial processes are important in global biogeochemical cycles such as acetogenesis, nitrification and denitrification and are critical for soil fertility.|$|E

5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal social costs of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share the costs and benefits <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or {{the costs and benefits of}} adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E

5|$|H2 is {{a product}} of some types of {{anaerobic}} metabolism and is produced by several microorganisms, usually via reactions catalyzed by iron- or nickel-containing enzymes called hydrogenases. These enzymes catalyze the reversible redox reaction between H2 and its component two protons and two electrons. Creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water. The natural cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called the hydrogen cycle.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a nonivasive approach to study redox state <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> cytochromes c, c 1 and b of complexes II and III in mitochondria of live cardiomyocytes {{by means of}} Raman microspectroscopy. For {{the first time with}} the proposed approach we perform studies of rod- and round-shaped cardiomyocytes, representing different morphological and functional states. Raman mapping and cluster analysis reveal that these cardiomyocytes differ in the amounts <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> cytochromes c, c 1 and b. The rod-shaped cardiomyocytes possess uneven distribution <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> cytochromes c, c 1 and b in cell center and periphery. Moreover, by means of Raman spectroscopy we demonstrated the decrease in the relative amounts <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> cytochromes c, c 1 and b in the rod-shaped cardiomyocytes caused by H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress before any visible changes. Results of Raman mapping and time-dependent study <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> cytochromes <b>of</b> complexes II and III and cytochrome c in cardiomyocytes are in a good agreement with our fluorescence indicator studies and other published data...|$|R
