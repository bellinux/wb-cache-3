5|$|The {{electronic}} music of Kid A and Amnesiac {{was inspired by}} Yorke's admiration for {{electronic music}} exemplified by Warp Records artists such as Aphex Twin; in 2013, Yorke named Aphex Twin as his biggest influence. The album also samples early computer music. The jazz of Charles Mingus, Alice Coltrane and Miles Davis, and 1970s krautrock bands such as Can and Neu!, were other major influences during this period. Jonny Greenwood's interest in 20th century classical music also had a role, as the influence of composers Krzysztof Penderecki and Olivier Messiaen was apparent; since the recording of Kid A, Greenwood has played the <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenot,</b> an early electronic instrument popularised by Messiaen.|$|E
25|$|Unusual for the time, an LP {{recording}} of Elmer Bernstein's score was released alongside the soundtrack in 1981, and it featured the composer's {{first use of}} the <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenot,</b> an instrument which became a trademark of Bernstein's later career. On March 13, 2008, Film Score Monthly released an official, expanded CD release of Bernstein's score, which he conducted. The score was performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra with the London Voices and Jeanne Loriod on the <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenot.</b>|$|E
25|$|Developments of {{the vacuum}} tube led to {{electronic}} instruments that were smaller, amplified, and more practical for performance. In particular, the theremin, <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenot</b> and trautonium were commercially {{produced by the}} early 1930s.|$|E

25|$|Léon Theremin was a Russian inventor, {{most famous}} for his {{invention}} of the theremin around 1919–1920, {{one of the first}} electronic musical instruments. The <b>Ondes</b> <b>Martenot</b> is another early example of an electronic musical instrument.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, Varèse {{returned}} to Paris to alter {{one of the}} parts in Amériques to include the recently constructed <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenot.</b> Around 1930, he composed his most famous non-electronic piece entitled Ionisation, the first to feature solely percussion instruments. Although it was composed with pre-existing instruments, Ionisation was an exploration of new sounds and methods to create them.|$|E
25|$|Other {{controllers}} include theremin, lightbeam controllers, touch buttons (touche d’intensité) on the <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenot,</b> {{and various}} types of foot pedals. Envelope following systems, the most sophisticated being the vocoder, are controlled by the power or amplitude of input audio signal. A musician uses the talk box to manipulate sound using the vocal tract, though it is rarely categorized as a synthesizer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music is}} {{arranged}} from an earlier, unpublished piece, [...] "Oraison" [...] from [...] "Fête des belles eaux" [...] for 6 <b>Ondes</b> <b>Martenots,</b> {{performed at the}} Paris World Fair in 1937. The tempo marking is infiniment lent, extatique ("infinitely slow, ecstatic").|$|R
50|$|Fête des belles eaux is a 1937 {{composition}} by French composer Olivier Messiaen. The work is scored for six <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenots</b> and {{was commissioned}} for the 1937 Paris Exhibition. The work was written {{to accompany the}} movement of the fountains at the Exhibition.|$|R

25|$|Radiohead {{began work}} on Kid A in Paris in January 1999 with OK Computer {{producer}} Nigel Godrich and no deadline. Yorke, who had the greatest control in the band, was still facing writer's block. His new songs were incomplete, and some consisted of little more than sounds or drum machine rhythms; few had clear verses or choruses. Instead of working as a traditional rock band, Radiohead experimented with electronic instruments including modular synthesisers and the <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenot,</b> an early theremin-like electronic instrument. Godrich and the band used software such as Pro Tools and Cubase to edit and manipulate their recordings.|$|E
25|$|There is a Circe {{episode in}} John Harbison's Ulysses (Act 1, scene 2, 1983) {{in which the}} song of the enchantress is {{represented}} by <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenot</b> and tuned percussion. After the sailors of Ullyses are transformed into animals by her spell, a battle of wills follows between Circe and the hero. Though the men are changed back, Ulysses is charmed by her in his turn. In 1993, a full scale treatment of the story followed in 's 2-act Circe und Odysseus. Also psychological in intent, it represents Circe's seduction of the restless hero as ultimately unsuccessful. The part played by the geometrical set in its Berlin production was particularly notable.|$|E
25|$|Kid A is {{the fourth}} studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, {{released}} on 2 October 2000 by Parlophone. On {{the verge of a}} breakdown after promoting Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer, songwriter Thom Yorke envisioned a radical change in direction. Radiohead replaced their rock sound with synthesisers, drum machines, the <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenot,</b> string orchestras and brass instruments. They incorporated influences from genres such as electronic music, krautrock, jazz, and 20th-century classical music. They recorded Kid A with OK Computer producer Nigel Godrich in Paris, Copenhagen, Gloucestershire and their hometown Oxford, England. The sessions produced over 20 tracks, and Radiohead split the work in two albums: Kid A and Amnesiac. The latter was released the following year.|$|E
5000|$|Yorke {{described}} [...] "You and Whose Army?" [...] {{as being}} [...] "about {{someone who is}} elected into power by people and who then blatantly betrays them - just like Blair did." [...] Attempting to capture the [...] "soft, warm, proto-doowop sound" [...] of the 1940s harmony group the Ink Spots, Radiohead muffled microphones with eggboxes and used the <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenot's</b> resonating palme diffuseur loudspeaker to treat the vocals.|$|R
5000|$|First {{commissioned}} in 2004 {{to build}} modern {{version of the}} Electro-Theremin as used by The Beach Boys on their 1966 single [...] "Good Vibrations", only 12 of these instruments went to musicians and studios in North America and Europe. In 2010, Therevox was commissioned by Montreal's Breakglass Studio [...] to design a new instrument that would combine the <b>Ondes</b> <b>Martenot's</b> au ruban and touche d’intensité interface with a dual oscillator analog synthesizer similar to the MiniMoog. The design included a built-in Spring Reverb and this prototype became the ET-4 [...] model that has been available since 2012.|$|R
5000|$|Nocturnal (1961) for soprano, male choir, and orchestra, is {{a musical}} {{composition}} by Edgard Varèse with text consisting of syllables by Varèse and {{words and phrases}} adapted from House of Incest by Anaïs Nin (1936), revised and completed posthumously by Chou Wen-chung (1968), The piece is commissioned by and dedicated to the Koussevitzky Music Foundation, published 1972. It includes music for flexatone and two <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenots.</b> The use of Dada-like [...] "meta-language" [...] in Ecuatorial and in Nocturnal was suggested by Antonin Artaud. The premier was conducted by Robert Craft at The Town Hall in New York on May 1, 1961.|$|R
25|$|Boulez earned {{money by}} giving {{mathematics}} lessons to his landlord's son. He also played the <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenot</b> (an early electronic instrument), improvising accompaniments to radio dramas and occasionally deputising {{in the pit}} orchestra of the Folies Bergère. In early 1946 the actor and director Jean-Louis Barrault needed someone to play the instrument for a production of Hamlet for the new company he and his wife, Madeleine Renaud, had formed. Honegger suggested Boulez. He was soon appointed Music Director of the Compagnie Renaud-Barrault, a post he held for nine years. He arranged and conducted incidental music, mostly by composers {{with whom he had}} little affinity (such as Milhaud and Tchaikovsky), but it gave him the chance to work with professional musicians, whilst leaving him time to compose during the day. It also broadened his horizons: in 1947 the company toured to Belgium and Switzerland ("absolutely pays de cocagne , my first discovery of the big world"); in 1948 they took their production of Hamlet to the second Edinburgh International Festival; in 1951 they gave a season of plays at St James's Theatre in London at the invitation of Laurence Olivier; and between 1950 and 1957 there were three tours to South America and two to North America. The music he wrote for the company was lost during the student occupation of the Théâtre de l'Odéon in 1968.|$|E

5000|$|He {{conducted}} in 2017 at the Frankfurt Opera a double bill of Debussy's cantata La Damoiselle élue and Honegger's dramatic oratorio Jeanne d'Arc au bûcher, again staged by Ollé, and co-produced with the Teatro Real Madrid. A reviewer {{noted that the}} conductor [...] "creates a unique musical wonderworld" [...] ("Soustrot erschafft eine einzigartige musikalische Wunderwelt"), with pianos, celesta and <b>Ondes</b> <b>Martenots</b> highlighting special moments. Hans-Klaus Jungheinrich wrote in the Frankfurter Rundschau: [...] "Umsichtig und stilgenau differenzierten Gastdirigent Marc Soustrot und das Opernorchester zwischen der behutsam abgetönten Debussy-Klanglichkeit und dem breiten Pinsel einer auch gröbste Wirkung souverän einbeziehenden Interpretation der Honegger-Textur." [...] (Prudently and precise in style, the guest conductor Marc Soustrot and the opera orchestra differentiated between the carefully toned Debussy sonority and {{an interpretation of the}} broader brush of the Honegger texture, including even crude effects souvereignly).|$|R
50|$|Sametz’s {{earliest}} choral-orchestral works exhibit {{his fascination}} {{with a wide variety}} of orchestral coloration. His use of Burmese gongs (muji no makotoba—Scripture without words on a text by Hakuin Ekaku), hammer dulcimer, <b>onde</b> <b>martenot</b> and cimbalon (cent fois plus ombre... on a text by Robert Desnos) lead to later experimentation with Indian tampura and tablas in his The Demon King (1996) and Shamalyo (2007), (both in collaboration with the Indian singer/writer, Arati Shah-Yukich). This sound palette is further expanded by his more recent use of electronics, using digital delay on obbligato instruments with choir. His Fantasia on Jesu, meine Freude (2009),Voices of Broken Hearts (2010) and Fantasia on Call to Remembrance (2011) all stretch the boundaries of human singing into the realm of enhanced electronic vocal production. Use of electronic enhancement was foreshadowed in his The White Raven — ballet-concerto for piano, chorus and orchestra (2005) and the violin concerto of 2006, Be/dazzled. Sametz used digital delay on six core instruments in his setting of A Child’s Requiem.|$|R

500|$|Most {{electronic}} {{elements were}} not overdubbed but recorded {{live in the}} studio. Greenwood used the music programming language Max to sample and manipulate the band's playing in real time, and continued to use modular synthesisers and the <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenot,</b> an early theremin-like electronic instrument he had first used on Kid A. After using effects pedals heavily on previous albums, he mostly used clean guitar sounds {{to see if he}} could [...] "come up with interesting things" [...] without effects.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{worked on}} In Rainbows {{for more than}} two years, {{beginning}} in early 2005. In mid-2006, after their initial recording sessions with new producer Spike Stent proved fruitless, the band toured Europe and North America performing In Rainbows material before re-enlisting their longtime producer Nigel Godrich. The album is more personal than previous Radiohead albums, with singer Thom Yorke describing most of the songs as his versions of [...] "seduction songs". Radiohead incorporated a variety of musical styles and instruments, using electronic instruments, string arrangements, piano, and the <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenot.</b>|$|E
500|$|Composer Barry Gray {{recorded}} his score, his favourite {{of all his}} musical contributions to the Anderson productions, in three days from 27 to 29 March 1969. Fifty-five musicians attended the first studio session, with 44 at the second and 28 at the last. The track titled [...] "Sleeping Astronauts", which accompanies the scenes of Ross and Kane's journey through the Solar System, features an <b>Ondes</b> <b>Martenot,</b> played by French ondiste Sylvette Allart. Archer and Hearn credit [...] "Sleeping Astronauts" [...] as [...] "one of the most enchanting pieces Gray ever wrote", and state that the soundtrack, which has not yet received a commercial release, evokes a [...] "traditional Hollywood feel" [...] that {{is in contrast to}} the 2069 setting of Doppelgänger.|$|E
500|$|... "Backdrifts (Honeymoon is Over)" [...] is an {{electronic}} song about [...] "the slide backwards that's happening everywhere you look." [...] "Go to Sleep (Little Man being Erased)" [...] {{begins with an}} acoustic guitar riff Colin Greenwood described as [...] "1960s English sort of folk". [...] "Where I End and You Begin (The Sky is Falling In)" [...] is a rock song with [...] "walls" [...] of <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenot</b> and rhythm section influenced by New Order. Yorke described [...] "We Suck Young Blood (Your Time is Up)" [...] as a [...] "slave ship tune" [...] with a [...] "freeform jazz nightmare" [...] break, and is [...] "not to be taken seriously." [...] With ill-timed, [...] "zombie-like" [...] handclaps, the song satirises Hollywood culture and its [...] "constant desire to stay young and fleece people, suck their energy." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to a commission for a piece to accompany light-and-water shows on the Seine during the Paris Exposition, in 1937 Messiaen demonstrated his interest in using the <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenot,</b> an electronic instrument, by composing Fêtes des belles eaux for an ensemble of six. He included a part for the instrument in several of his subsequent compositions. During this period he composed several multi-movement organ works. He arranged his orchestral suite L'ascension ("The Ascension") for organ, replacing the orchestral version's third movement with an entirely new movement, Transports de joie d'une âme devant la gloire du Christ qui est la sienne ("Ecstasies of a soul before the glory of Christ which is the soul's own") (...) [...] He also wrote the extensive cycles La Nativité du Seigneur ("The Nativity of the Lord") and Les corps glorieux ("The glorious bodies").|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the main theme, Gray scored incidental music for 18 episodes of Captain Scarlet between March and December 1967. Musical accompaniment for the remaining 14 episodes was achieved by re-using these completed tracks as well as music from previous Anderson productions such as Thunderbirds. In composing his incidental music, Gray made extensive use of two contrasting, yet similar, themes to illustrate Spectrum and the Mysterons. In their notes to the soundtrack release, Ralph Titterton and Tim Mallett suggest that the music is dominated by a [...] "military feel", with an emphasis placed on percussion, brass and wind instruments, by contrast to the full orchestral sound of the Thunderbirds score. With {{the exception of the}} four-note Mysteron motif, Gray generally restricted his use of electronic synthesisers, including an <b>Ondes</b> <b>Martenot,</b> to space sequences, preferring traditional instruments for Earth-bound action. Captain Scarlet's motif, heard in both versions of the end credits theme and the incidental music, is a melodic variation on the Mysteron theme, emphasising Scarlet's history as an ex-Mysteron.|$|E
500|$|In October 2000 Radiohead {{released}} {{their fourth}} album, Kid A, {{the first of}} two albums from these recording sessions. A departure from OK Computer, Kid A featured a minimalist and textured style with more diverse instrumentation, including the <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenot,</b> programmed electronic beats, strings, and jazz horns. It debuted at number one in many countries, including the US, where its debut atop the Billboard chart marked a first for the band, and the first US number one album by any UK act since the Spice Girls in 1996. This success was attributed variously to marketing, to the album's leak on the file-sharing network Napster a few months before its release, and to advance anticipation based, in part, on the success of OK Computer. Although Radiohead did not release any singles from Kid A, promos of [...] "Optimistic" [...] and [...] "Idioteque" [...] received radio play, and a series of [...] "blips", or short videos set to portions of tracks, were played on music channels and released freely on the internet. The band had read Naomi Klein's anti-globalisation book No Logo during the recording, and decided to continue a summer 2000 tour of Europe later in the year in a custom-built tent free of advertising; they also promoted Kid A with three sold-out North American theatre concerts.|$|E
500|$|Yorke is Radiohead's {{principal}} songwriter and lyricist; songs usually {{begin with}} a sketch by Yorke, which is harmonically developed by Jonny Greenwood before the other members develop their own parts. Arrangement is a collaborative effort, with all the band members having roles in the process; all the band's songs are credited to [...] "Radiohead". While Jonny Greenwood plays most lead guitar parts, O'Brien makes use of effects units to create ambient effects. The Kid A and Amnesiac sessions brought a change in Radiohead's musical style and working method. Since their shift from conventional rock music instrumentation toward an emphasis on electronic sound, the members have gained flexibility and now regularly switch instruments depending on the particular song requirements. On Kid A and Amnesiac, Yorke played keyboard and bass, while Jonny Greenwood often played <b>ondes</b> <b>Martenot,</b> bassist Colin Greenwood worked on sampling, and O'Brien and Selway branched out to drum machines and digital manipulation, also finding ways to incorporate their primary instruments, guitar and percussion, respectively, into the new sound. The relaxed 2003 recording sessions for Hail to the Thief led to a different dynamic in Radiohead, with Yorke admitting in interviews that his power in the band had been [...] "absolutely unbalanced" [...] {{and that he would}} [...] "subvert everybody else's power at all costs. But... it's actually a lot more healthy now, democracy-wise, than it used to be." ...|$|E
