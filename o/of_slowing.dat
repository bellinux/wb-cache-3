5|$|Negotiations {{initially}} {{focused on}} a comprehensive ban, but this was abandoned due to technical questions surrounding the detection of underground tests and Soviet concerns over the intrusiveness of proposed verification methods. The impetus for the test ban was provided by rising public anxiety over the magnitude of nuclear tests, particularly tests of new thermonuclear weapons (hydrogen bombs), and the resulting nuclear fallout. A test ban was also seen as a means <b>of</b> <b>slowing</b> nuclear proliferation and the nuclear arms race. Though the PTBT did not halt proliferation or the arms race, its enactment did coincide with a substantial decline in the concentration of radioactive particles in the atmosphere.|$|E

The Agency gave Brand a document, dated 29 May 1944, that offered $400,000 for every 1,000 Jewish emigrants to Palestine, one million Swiss francs per 10,000 Jewish emigrants to neutral countries such as Spain, and 10,000 Swiss francs a month if the deportations were to stop. If the SS would allow the Allies to supply food, clothes and medicine to the Jews in concentration camps, the Nazis would be supplied with the same. Rose writes that the agreement was intended only to give Brand something to take back to Budapest.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{were also}} {{experiencing}} their own supply problems. To {{enable them to}} mount a counter-attack, it was vital that they build up a stockpile of supplies in the forward areas. To reduce the burden placed on the native carrier system the Allies turned to aerial resupply, a technique that was still in its infancy. The loss of Kokoda had deprived them of a forward airfield, but to an extent this had been alleviated by {{the creation of a}} supply drop zone for US transport aircraft around the dry lake at Myola. These efforts, though, were hamstrung by deficiencies in the aerial resupply process and inexperience in its application. Only a few supplies were dropped by parachute, while the rest were just free-dropped. Inevitably some supplies fell away from their intended drop zones, while others were damaged due to inadequate packaging. Additionally, poor staff work and inattention resulted in fewer supplies being collected in the drop zone than Potts had been promised. This had the effect <b>of</b> <b>slowing</b> the arrival of the Australian reinforcements as they had to be held up and then committed piecemeal company by company, as adequate supplies could be brought forward to sustain them.|$|E

40|$|Modulation of {{spontaneous}} electrical activities (slow waves, pacemaker potentials and follower potentials) {{in response to}} hyperpolarization produced by the ATP-sensitive K+ channel openers (KCOs) pinacidil or nicorandil was investigated in smooth muscle tissues of the guinea-pig stomach antrum. With hyperpolarization, the amplitude <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> waves and follower potentials was reduced and that of pacemaker potentials was increased, with a minor modulation of their frequency. The attenuation <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> waves was associated with an inhibition of the 1 st component and abolition of the 2 nd component. All these actions of KCOs were antagonized by glibenclamide. An increase in the extracellular K+ concentration prevented the KCO-induced hyperpolarization with partial restoration <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> waves, suggesting that the inhibition was produced mainly by a decrease in membrane resistance. Exposure of tissues to KCOs {{for a long period}} of time (> 20 min) resulted in the reappearance <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> waves displaying both 1 st and 2 nd components. The 2 nd component <b>of</b> the <b>slow</b> wave, which displayed a slower recovery, was inhibited again by 5 -hydroxydecanoic acid, an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Noradrenaline hyperpolarized the membrane by activating apamin-sensitive K+ channels and increased the amplitude and frequency <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> waves through activation of α 1 -adrenoceptors, actions different from those of KCOs. Thus, inhibition <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> waves by KCOs may be primarily related to the decrease in amplitude of a passive electrotonic component, possibly due to a reduction of the input resistance. The hyperpolarization shifted the threshold potential for generation of the 2 nd component <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> waves to negative levels, presumably due to modulation of mitochondrial functions...|$|R

40|$|Through S 1 {{nuclease}} mapping using {{a specific}} cDNA probe, we {{demonstrate that the}} slow myosin heavy-chain (MHC) gene, characteristic of adult soleus, is expressed in bulk hind limb muscle obtained from the 18 -d rat fetus. We support these results by use of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) which is highly specific to the adult <b>slow</b> MHC. Immunoblots <b>of</b> MHC peptide maps show the same peptides, uniquely recognized by this antibody in adult soleus, are also identified in 18 -d fetal limb muscle. Thus synthesis <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> myosin is an early event in skeletal myogenesis and is expressed concurrently with embryonic myosin. By immunofluorescence we demonstrate that in the 16 -d fetus all primary myotubes in future fast and future slow muscles homogeneously express slow as well as embryonic myosin. Fiber heterogeneity arises owing to a developmentally regulated inhibition <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> MHC accumulation as muscles are progressively assembled from successive orders of cells. Assembly involves addition of new, superficial areas of the anterior tibial muscle (AT) and extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL) in which primary cells initially stain weakly or are unstained with the slow mAb. In the developing AT and EDL, expression <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> myosin is unstable and is progressively restricted as these muscles specialize more and more towards the fast phenotype. Slow fibers persisting in deep portions of the adult EDL and AT are interpreted as vestiges of the original muscle primordium. A comparable inhibition <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> MHC accumulation occurs in the developing soleus but involves secondary, not primary, cells. Our {{results show that the}} fate of secondary cells is flexible and is spatially determined. By RIA we show that the relative proportions <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> MHC are fivefold greater in the soleus than in the EDL or AT at birth. After neonatal denervation, concentrations <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> MHC in the soleus rapidly decline, and we hypothesize that, in this muscle, the nerve protects and amplifies initial programs <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> MHC synthesis. Conversely, the content <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> MHC rises in the neonatally denervated EDL. This suggests that as the nerve amplifies fast MHC accumulation in the developing EDL, accumulation <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> MHC is inhibited in an antithetic fashion. Studies with phenylthiouracil-induced hypothyroidism indicate that inhibition <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> MHC accumulation in the EDL and AT is not initially under thyroid regulation. At later stages, the development of thyroid function plays a role in inhibiting slow MHC accumulation in the differentiating EDL and AT. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R
