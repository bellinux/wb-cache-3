Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England {{on its way to the}} Navajo. Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles. The Navajo obtained black dye through piñon pitch and ashes.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of the research are to determine the energy spectrum and wave function of Morsewith centrifugal term using SUSY quantum mechanics. The Morsewith centrifugal termpotential is type of shape invariant potential. The energy spectrum of Morsepotential with centrifugal term is <b>obtained</b> using Supersymmetry -WKB (SWKB) quantization formula and Supersymmetry Operator. The wave function is <b>obtained</b> using Supersymmetry Operator. The energy spectrum <b>obtained</b> using SWKB quantization formula {{is equal to the}} result <b>obtained</b> using Supersymmetry Operator. The ground statewave function is <b>obtained</b> from the property of lowering operator that annihilates the ground state wave function. The first excited state wave function is <b>obtained</b> by applying raising operator on the ground state wave function and so the higher level excited state wave functions <b>obtained</b> by operating raising operator to the nearest lower wave function. The energy spectrum <b>obtained</b> using SWKB quantization formula is equal to the result <b>obtained</b> using Supersymmetry Operator.

Methods: Forced spirometry was performed, {{in accordance with the}} Brazilian Thoracic Society guidelines, in 643 nonsmoking adult Caucasians. The predicted values <b>obtained</b> by Brazilian researchers in 1992 and those <b>obtained</b> by four groups of foreign researchers were compared with the new Brazilian predicted values <b>obtained</b> in 2006.
