30|$|Despite this {{complexity}} {{occurring at}} near lethal Cxts, single and repeated subchronic 90 -day inhalation studies of rats with 6  h/day exposure 5  times/week {{demonstrated that the}} chronic effects of phosgene gas appear to be contingent on “acute-on-chronic” localized effects. Essentially identical NOAELs were observed independent of whether the duration of exposure was acute or subchronic [33, 63]. In contrast to more water-soluble irritant gases, airway toxicity or delayed-onset types of inhalation toxicity (e.g., <b>obliterating</b> <b>bronchiolitis)</b> were not observed in the more recent animal models of phosgene [33, 37, 38].|$|E

The objective is to warn {{of the danger of}} ammonia and of the need to improve preventive programs of occupational medicine. The method of comparing the two injured workers, i. e. their spirometric values, was used. The results showed progressive diminishing of patients´ respiratory abilities, in the patient with lungs transplanted VC 32 %, FVC 33 %, FEV 1 16 % and FEF 75 %= 6 % in 2006, the year when he died. In the patient that survived, the values in 2008 were VC 43. 5 %, FVC 27. 2 %, FEV 1 % 56. 7 % and FEF 75 %= 6 %. The patients´ CT showed diffused fibrosing and bronchiectasiae. <b>Obliterating</b> <b>bronchiolitis</b> developed in both patients. The second patient is the lung transplantation candidate. The first patient developed post transplantation cytomegalovirus pneumonia so he fought CMV antigenemia and infection till the end...|$|E
