50|$|The Eastern Cape Department of Education {{has been}} roundly criticised for poor primary and {{secondary}} education resulting from dysfunction, special interests, and issues with the South Africa teachers union, SADTU.

40|$|Teaching {{corporate}} {{environmental management}} (CEM) is fundamental {{for the education}} of more responsible students. We analyzed the main challenges for CEM in Brazil from the viewpoint of teachers. Results indicate five types of barriers for teaching CEM, denoted here as the “ 5 Ls”, namely <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> integration of other teachers in the teaching <b>of</b> CEM, <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> acceptance <b>of</b> CEM as <b>a</b> subject by the peers teachers, <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> focus on business while teaching CEM, <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> CEM teaching materials appropriate for the realities <b>of</b> Brazil and <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> interest among some students in CEM...|$|R
5|$|A naval {{board of}} inquiry was {{appointed}} shortly afterwards that determined {{the cause of}} the collision was <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of seamanship by the captain and watch officers of the ship. The Justice Minister, Kobie Coetsee, subsequently introduced a retrospective change in law to allow him to hold an inquest into the death of the only crewman whose body was found. The inquest lasted a year and apportioned blame on the captain and PWO.|$|E
5|$|A {{working group}} {{produced}} a 34-page report with recommendations following the official inquiry, which {{was approved by}} the Jockey Club. Considerable public discussion had arisen over the possibility of introducing electronic devices, such as horns or flashing lights, to provide a fail-safe starting and recall system. The use of modern technology however was dismissed on the basis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of total success overseas, and being open to sabotage and technical failure.|$|E
5|$|Allegations {{of fraud}} and {{corruption}} were again raised in 2004 by former chief auditor Jules Muis. A Commission officer Guido Strack reported alleged fraud and abuses in his department in years 2002–2004 to OLAF and was fired as result. In 2008 Paul van Buitenen (the former auditor known from Santer Commission scandal) accused the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of independence and effectiveness.|$|E

The problem areas are identified as <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> resources, <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> personnel, and <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> enthusiasm among employees for the program. The evaluation of these problem areas gives insight to the support obtained from management. Recommendations for improving these problem areas follow the analysis...|$|R
5|$|Although JNA {{losses were}} {{undoubtedly}} substantial, the exact numbers are unclear because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of official data. The JNA officially acknowledged 1,279 killed in action, including 177 officers, {{during the entire}} war in Croatia. According to Tus, the JNA's Novi Sad corps alone lost 1,300 soldiers during the campaign in eastern Slavonia. He extrapolates from this to estimate that between 6,000 and 8,000 soldiers and volunteers died in eastern Slavonia, {{with the loss of}} 600 armoured vehicles and heavy weapons and over 20 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{strained}} the UN logistics system {{was the lack}} of a previously drafted resupply plan. Consumption rates differed among the various units and as a result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of coordination, some UN units faced supply shortages when other units would request more material than they actually needed. In order to rectify this situation UN logisticians were forced to hastily create a plan as the need arose.|$|E
5|$|Beekeepers in Scotland also {{reported}} losses {{for the past}} three years. Andrew Scarlett, a Perthshire-based bee farmer and honey packer, lost 80% of his 1,200 hives during the 2009/10 winter. He attributed the losses to a virulent bacterial infection that quickly spread because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of bee inspectors, coupled with sustained poor weather that prevented honey bees from building up sufficient pollen and nectar stores.|$|E

With donations declining as donors get older, charitable marketers need to turn their attention to a younger generation. This paper attempts to provide some insight into the supporting behaviour (through donations and volunteering) of Generation Y students at a South African University and measures their attitude towards supporting charitable organisations. Based on the results, managerial implications and recommendations for future research are proposed...|$|R

5|$|Fauna is sparse on {{the island}} due to a {{combination}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of vegetation {{and the consequences of}} phosphates mining. Many indigenous birds have disappeared or become rare owing to destruction of their habitat. There are about 60recorded vascular plant species native to the island, none of which are endemic. Coconut farming, mining, and introduced species have caused serious disturbance to the native vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Following the Romanian Revolution, due to {{shortage}} of funds, many units were disbanded and much equipment was phased out. Likewise, Romanian military capability declined because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of fuel {{as well as}} training. However, since the late 1990s, a number of positive changes have come about {{and the level of}} combat readiness is growing greatly; since 1996, the military budget has grown more than four times - rising from 636 million dollars to 2.8 billion dollars in 2007. Conscription has been abolished and professionalisation has been completed.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter {{and the nearby}} Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, mostly found in cellars because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of space; these {{included}} the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. They introduced Parisians {{to the music of}} Claude Luter, Boris Vian, Sydney Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, and Henri Salvador.
