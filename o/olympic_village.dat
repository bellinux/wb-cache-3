5|$|A notable venue {{not found}} at the 1956 Games was an <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village,</b> where the athletes would be housed. The town of Cortina d'Ampezzo had a {{population}} of less than 7,000 people in 1956. Local hotels were concerned that after the Olympics an <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village</b> would so significantly increase the hotel capacity it would put many of them out of business. Athletes were billeted by local families or stayed in hotels during the Games.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{suggests}} a flexible {{system and its}} systems approach in constructing <b>Olympic</b> <b>Villages</b> which are used both {{during and after the}} Games. A historical overview of ancient Olympia and modern Olympia, as well as a case study of modern <b>Olympic</b> <b>Villages</b> deal with the conceptual problem which were arisen in the design of <b>Olympic</b> <b>Villages,</b> due to the conflict between monumentality and practicality, and the contextual problems, caused by the pressure of time and cost in the building process. An approach to appropriate patterns proposes the construction of high - rise buildings and solves secondary problems in design and construction. A conceptual approach suggests perceptional complexity and flexibility. A contextual approach suggests the systems approach for fast track development which is compared with the conventional building process. Analogies of some notable building systems and their approaches in the past development of systems suggest an open system, a dual structure and performance based programming as the strategy for designing and building future <b>Olympic</b> <b>Villages.</b> by Se-Hack Chung.

5|$|Lillehammer {{failed at}} its bid {{to host the}} 2012 Winter Youth Olympics, losing to Innsbruck, Austria, but was awarded the 2016 edition as the only bidder. The bid was based on reuse of the {{heritage}} and venues from the 1994 Olympics.

5|$|The {{unsuccessful}} Chicago 2016 Olympic bid {{placed the}} main {{site of the}} $1.1 billion residential complex, which would have accommodated athletes in an <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village</b> in the 4th Ward. Preckwinkle expressed her reservations about the initial plan, and was involved in plan revisions. Since the planned construction was almost entirely in her ward, she expressed concern that her constituents were not offered a chance to voice their concerns with the plan. She was an early advocate of moving {{what would have been}} the <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village</b> from the McCormick Place truck yard to the Michael Reese Hospital site. On March 14, 2007, Preckwinkle joined four other South Side aldermen in voting against a $500 million public-funded guarantee to back up Chicago's Olympics bid. On September 9, 2009, Preckwinkle voted to authorize Mayor Richard Daley to sign the International Olympic Committee's host city contract that included financial guarantees putting full responsibility for the Olympics and its proposed $4.8 billion operating budget on taxpayers.|$|E
5|$|All {{competition}} and non-competition venues were within 30 {{minutes of the}} Youth <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village,</b> the Main Media Centre (MMC) and the Olympic Family Hotels (OFH). An Event Transport Operations Centre (ETOC) managed all transport matters relating to the YOG, providing real-time travel information. A shuttle service linked all YOG venues for all accredited persons, who were also entitled to complimentary travel on public buses and the Mass Rapid Transit system. Youth Olympic Lanes were designated along key routes for faster access to all YOG venues.|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{evaluation}} found the bid technically robust, using existing venues, good hosting {{experience and a}} large number of guaranteed hotel rooms within Harbin as principal strengths. However, a three village concept made for a rather dispersed project and the culture and education program was weak. With a budget of US$43 million, events at Mao'ershan National Nature Reserve were cancelled to reduce the <b>Olympic</b> <b>Villages</b> to two, but still the distance between Harbin and Yabuli is 150km. A planned bobsleigh/sled site raised concerns, as did a reluctance to embrace a digital platform for the culture aspect. [...] However, the <b>Olympic</b> <b>Villages</b> were strong with a 2:1 bath/bed ratio.|$|R

5|$|Brundage {{hoped that}} the Munich Games would take {{the sting out of}} his defeat over the Rhodesian issue. Munich was one of his {{favorite}} cities, and the heitere Spiele (cheerful Games) were designed to efface memories of 1936 and Berlin {{in the eyes of the}} world. They initially seemed to be doing so, as athletic feats, like those of gymnast Olga Korbut and swimmer Mark Spitz captivated viewers. In the early morning of September 5, 1972, Palestinian terrorists from the organization Black September entered the <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village</b> and took 11Israelis hostage, demanding freedom for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli custody. Brundage, once informed, rushed to the <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village,</b> where he conferred with German and Bavarian state officials through the day, playing what Guttmann describes as a modest role in the discussions. German officials moved the hostages and their captors to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base, where German police and troops tried a rescue late that evening. The attempt was bungled; the nine remaining hostages (two had been murdered earlier) and three of their captors were killed.|$|E

The scope and scale of the Winter Olympics is smaller. For example, Sochi hosted 2,873 athletes from 88 nations competing in 98 events during the 2014 Winter Olympics. During the Games most athletes and officials are housed in the <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village.</b> This village {{is intended to be}} a self-contained home for all the Olympic participants, and is furnished with cafeterias, health clinics, and locations for religious expression.|$|E

5|$|Rio de Janeiro {{proposed}} to hold all sporting events {{within the city}} limits—apart from the football (soccer) tournaments which would {{be held in the}} cities of Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Salvador and São Paulo—making the Games more compact and technically feasible. The competition venues will be located in four Olympic zones—Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã—and divided in seven Olympic clusters—Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, Flamengo, João Havelange, Lagoa and Maracanã—with four Olympic precincts—Maracanã, Olympic Park, Riocentro and X Park. The Olympic and Paralympic Village, the International Broadcast Centre (IBC) and the Main Press Centre (MPC) will be located at the Barra zone, which is the core of the project and includes the largest number of competition venues. A television tower will be built at the IBC/MPC complex to complement broadcasting operations and provide panoramic studios. There will be a media-exclusive hotel within the complex, accessible directly from the IBC/MPC. The Olympic and Paralympic Village complex will include an <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village</b> Training Center, an <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village</b> Park, an Olympic Beach and direct access to the Olympic Park, in addition to the 8,856 rooms to accommodate over 17,770 athletes and team officials, including accredited additional officials.|$|E

5|$|Montenegro coach Sava Kovačević, {{whose team}} {{was knocked out}} by Bolivia in the semifinals, said that Montenegro would ask {{football}} governing body FIFA {{to look into the}} matter.

BC Place is an indoor stadium, so the Olympic torch cauldron, which was lit {{in the middle of the}} stadium during the opening ceremony, could not be left there because of safety concerns. A second [...] "external cauldron" [...] was erected on the Coal Harbour waterfront, next to the Main Media Centre.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village</b> {{for housing}} athletes {{during the games}} {{would have been a}} $1.1-billion series of newly {{constructed}} lakefront buildings that would have been converted to rental and condominium units after the games. The village was to be located immediately south of McCormick Place, which was expected to host 11 event venues, on a current truck parking lot between South Lake Shore Drive and the Illinois Central Railroad tracks in the Near South Side and Douglas community areas. At the time, the parking lot was being used to stage events at McCormick Place. The village was slated to have pedways over Lake Shore Drive. This location was meant to enable 88% of the Olympic athletes to be within 15 minutes of their competition venue.|$|E
5|$|At the 2006 U.S. Championships, the {{de facto}} Olympic qualifier, Lysacek was third after the short program, but pulled up to win the free skate, {{finishing}} second overall. He {{was named to the}} 2006 Winter Olympic team along with Johnny Weir and Matthew Savoie. At the Olympics, following a 10th-place finish in the short program, Lysacek became sick with the stomach flu. Unable to practice, he stayed in bed at the <b>Olympic</b> <b>village,</b> receiving fluids from IVs. After considering withdrawing, he decided to skate the next day and went on to skate a career-best free skate. He finished his free skate with eight triple jumps and was ranked third of the night. He finished fourth overall, seven points below the bronze. He commentated on his free-skating program on Olympic Ice the next day with Scott Hamilton and Mary Carillo.|$|E
5|$|Financing of {{the venue}} was officially {{granted by the}} Parliament of Norway in April 1990. The International Skating Union wanted to locate all skating in Hamar, and in October 1990, LOOC {{confirmed}} that they would reallocate the events {{so that all the}} all skating events would take place in Hamar, and that a separate <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village</b> would be built in Hamar for skaters. The original plans for the Olympic Amphitheatre called for a capacity for 4,500 and construction to cost NOK65. By June 1991, LOOC decided to increase the size of the venue, as IOC would only allow the venue host figure skating if its spectator capacity was raised to 6,000. Financing of the expansion was granted in August, with the cost rising to NOK83.3 million. Early plans called for the venue to be built in concrete, but a research project coordinated by the Norwegian Institute of Technology made it possible to cover the venue's exterior and interior in wood panel. This solution was hailed as aesthetical by architects, and as a technical innovation by the Norwegian construction industry.|$|E
50|$|As {{late as the}} 1940s, Otaniemi {{was part}} of the Hagalund manor and used as a park and farmland, from where an old linden allée survives. In 1949, the Government of Finland {{purchased}} the lands of Hagalund Manor for use as the campus of the Helsinki University of Technology and the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. First to be built was the student campus of the Helsinki University of Technology, which also served as one of the <b>Olympic</b> <b>Villages</b> in the 1952 Summer Olympics. Several thousand students currently live in Otaniemi. The region has since been built up around TKK and VTT, and {{is at the core of}} Finnish scientific and technological activities.|$|R
50|$|Stampesletta, a multi-sports complex next to Kristins Hall, {{hosted the}} opening and closing ceremonies. The medal ceremonies {{took place in the}} town plaza.

The Lillehammer village consisted of student apartments in combination with a hotel and apartment resort. They used Håkons Hall for dining. The Hamar village was Hotel Scandic Hamar. In addition, there are five designated cultural venues in Lillehammer: Kulturhuset Banken, Lillehammer Art Museum, Lillehammer University College, Maihaugen and the Nansen Academy. The Main Media Centre was located at Mesna Upper Secondary School, which is adjacent to Stampesletta.|$|R
