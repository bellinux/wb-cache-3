5|$|In 1992, the {{economist}} Harry Saunders dubbed {{the hypothesis that}} improvements in energy efficiency work to increase (rather than decrease) energy consumption the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate, and argued that the hypothesis is broadly supported by neoclassical growth theory (the mainstream economic theory of capital accumulation, technological progress and long-run economic growth). Saunders showed that the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate occurs in the neoclassical growth model under a wide range <b>of</b> <b>assumptions.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} I {{have found that}} it is {{difficult}} if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person the nature of his tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity <b>of</b> <b>assumptions</b> that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.|$|E
5|$|Risk parity advocates {{assert that}} the unlevered risk parity {{portfolio}} is quite close to the tangency portfolio, as close as can be measured given uncertainties and noise in the data. Theoretical and empirical arguments are made {{in support of this}} contention. One specific set <b>of</b> <b>assumptions</b> that puts the risk parity portfolio on the efficient frontier is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical Sharpe ratios. Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity portfolio is near the tangency portfolio but they say that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E

5|$|The {{integers}} {{have additional}} properties {{which do not}} generalize to all commutative rings. An important example is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which says that every positive integer can be factored uniquely into prime numbers. Unique factorizations do not always exist in other rings, but Noether found a unique factorization theorem, now called the Lasker–Noether theorem, for the ideals of many rings. Much of Noether's work lay in determining what properties do hold for all rings, in devising novel analogs of the old integer theorems, and in determining the minimal set <b>of</b> <b>assumptions</b> required to yield certain properties of rings.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection <b>of</b> <b>assumptions</b> about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E

25|$|Hof et al. (2008) (referred to by World Bank, 2010:8) {{examined}} {{the sensitivity of}} the optimal climate target to assumptions about the time horizon, climate sensitivity, mitigation costs, likely damages, and discount rates. The optimal target was defined as the concentration that would result in the lowest reduction in the present value (i.e., discounted) of global consumption. A set <b>of</b> <b>assumptions</b> that included a relatively high climate sensitivity (i.e., a relatively large global temperature increase for a given increase in GHGs), high damages, a long time horizon, low discount rates (i.e., future consumption is valued relatively highly), and low mitigation costs, produced an optimum peak in the concentration of CO2e at 540 parts per million (ppm). Another set <b>of</b> <b>assumptions</b> that assumed a lower climate sensitivity (lower global temperature increase), lower damages, a shorter time horizon, and a higher discount rate (present consumption is valued relatively more highly), produced an optimum peaking at 750ppm.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} thus {{claims that}} if we find the inverted spectrum plausible, we must admit that qualia exist (and are non-physical).

Perhaps {{it is not possible}} for a given brain state to produce anything other than a given quale in our universe, and that is all that matters.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} view is {{that certain}} scientific fields (such as theoretical physics) are mathematics with axioms that are intended to correspond to reality. Mathematics shares {{much in common with}} many fields in the physical sciences, notably the exploration of the logical consequences <b>of</b> <b>assumptions.</b> Intuition and experimentation also {{play a role in the}} formulation of conjectures in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. Experimental mathematics continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{literature}} has pointed to difficulties in these kinds <b>of</b> <b>assumptions.</b> For instance, there may be aversion at any price towards losing particular species. It has also been suggested that low-probability, extreme outcomes are overweighted when making choices. This is related to climate change, since the possibility of future abrupt changes in the climate or the Earth system cannot be ruled out. For example, if the West Antarctic ice sheet was to disintegrate, it {{could result in a}} sea level rise of 4–6meters over several centuries.|$|E
25|$|While most of {{the archaeological}} {{community}} is in general agreement that the Americas were settled by migrants from northeastern Asian populations, the chronology of the migrations, the source populations {{that contributed to the}} migrations, and their migration routes remain uncertain. The uncertainty is fed by a lack of archaeological evidence along migration routes that date to the periods when those migrations are proposed to have occurred; uncertainties in the dating and interpretation of the oldest proposed archaeosites in the Americas; and uncertainties <b>of</b> <b>assumptions</b> underlying chronological and source models of migration derived from studies of modern Native American genetics.|$|E

25|$|Infertility {{is often}} not seen (by the West) as being an issue outside industrialized countries. This is because <b>of</b> <b>assumptions</b> about {{overpopulation}} problems and hyper fertility in developing countries, and a perceived need for them to decrease their populations and birth rates. The lack {{of health care and}} high rates of life-threatening illness (such as HIV/AIDS) in developing countries, such as those in Africa, are supporting reasons for the inadequate supply of fertility treatment options. Fertility treatments, even simple ones such as treatment for STIs that cause infertility, are therefore not usually made available to individuals in these countries.|$|E
25|$|These derivations also {{emphasize}} the strictly formal {{structure of the}} sequent calculus. For example, the logical rules as defined above always act on a formula immediately adjacent to the turnstile, such that the permutation rules are necessary. Note, however, that this is in part an artifact of the presentation, in the original style of Gentzen. A common simplification {{involves the use of}} multisets of formulas in the interpretation of the sequent, rather than sequences, eliminating the need for an explicit permutation rule. This corresponds to shifting commutativity <b>of</b> <b>assumptions</b> and derivations outside the sequent calculus, whereas LK embeds it within the system itself.|$|E
25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} theory {{can be used}} in looking at pricing decisions. Field information such as retail and wholesale prices as well as the size of the market and market share are all incorporated into the prior information. Managerial judgement is included in order to evaluate different pricing strategies.

As markets are dynamic environments {{it is often difficult to}} fully apply Bayesian {{decision theory}} to pricing strategies without simplifying the model.|$|E

25|$|Selecting a {{different}} test usually identifies {{a different}} list of significant genes since each test operates under a specific set <b>of</b> <b>assumptions,</b> and places a different emphasis on certain {{features in the}} data. Many tests begin with the assumption of a normal distribution in the data, because {{that seems like a}} sensible starting point and often produces results that appear more significant. Some tests consider the joint distribution of all gene observations to estimate general variability in measurements, while others look at each gene in isolation. Many modern microarray analysis techniques involve bootstrapping (statistics), machine learning or Monte Carlo methods.|$|E
25|$|Organizational {{culture has}} been {{described}} as a set <b>of</b> <b>assumptions</b> shared by individuals in an organization; the assumptions influence the interpretation and actions that define appropriate behavior for various situations. Organizational {{culture has been}} shown to affect important organizational outcomes such as performance, attraction, recruitment, retention, employee satisfaction, and employee well-being. There are three levels of organizational culture: artifacts, shared values, and basic beliefs and assumptions. Artifacts comprise the physical components of the organization that relay cultural meaning. Shared values are individuals' preferences regarding certain aspects of the organization's culture (e.g., loyalty, customer service). Basic beliefs and assumptions include individuals' impressions about the trustworthiness and supportiveness of an organization, and are often deeply ingrained within the organization's culture.|$|E
25|$|Inverse {{dynamics}} is {{an inverse}} problem. It commonly refers to either inverse rigid body dynamics or inverse structural dynamics. Inverse rigid-body dynamics {{is a method}} for computing forces and/or moments of force (torques) based on the kinematics (motion) of a body and the body's inertial properties (mass and moment of inertia). Typically it uses link-segment models to represent the mechanical behaviour of interconnected segments, such as the limbs of humans, animals or robots, where given the kinematics of the various parts, inverse dynamics derives the minimum forces and moments responsible for the individual movements. In practice, inverse dynamics computes these internal moments and forces from measurements of the motion of limbs and external forces such as ground reaction forces, under a special set <b>of</b> <b>assumptions.</b>|$|E
