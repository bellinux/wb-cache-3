5|$|Academic {{study of}} Barbadian music remains limited. Some song {{collections}} {{and other activities}} have been conducted, but there remain significant holes in scholarship, such as the musics of recent immigrants from China and India, who presumably have brought with them styles of Indian and Chinese musics. Due to a lack <b>of</b> <b>archaeological</b> and historical records, the island's indigenous music is unknown. Since the 1970s, an increase in general interest in Barbadian culture has spurred greater study of music, and given an incentive to radio and television stations to create and maintain archives of cultural practices.|$|E
5|$|According to an {{alternative}} theory, {{popular in the}} earlier 20th century and still represented today, the medieval cultures {{in the area of}} modern Poland are not a result of massive immigration, but emerged from a cultural transition of earlier indigenous populations, who then would need to be regarded as early Slavs. This view has mostly been discarded, primarily due to a period <b>of</b> <b>archaeological</b> discontinuity, during which settlements were absent or rare, and because of cultural incompatibility of the late ancient and early medieval sites.|$|E
