40|$|The bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> {{is a kind}} {{of paper}} in order that its holder shall entitle the debtor named in the {{document}} to pay a certain amount of payments. The bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> represents a means of payment and an instrument of providing the payment. It is an unconditional order given by the drawer to the drawee to pay a certain amount to the payee listed on the bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> The bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> is generally a paper on the orders but it can be issued as value paper to a name. It is such promissory notes where the issuer becomes a clause not by order. The bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> though it appears as a means of payment and an instrument for securing the payment it also appears as a means of international payment, because the bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> can become a modern instrument of crediting and payment. With the development of the credit market and the bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> becomes a means for the drawer and the drawee. This means that instead of the bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> to be paid after the expiry of a certain deadline for submission of the bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> the holder may sell or discount, or to pay before the deadline for submission. With this the bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> becomes a toll for discount. Based on this we can conclude that the bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> has the following roles: -bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> serves as a means of credit; -bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> serves as means of payment; -bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> serves as a means for discount by. ...|$|R

Such a usage of a bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> brings as well a series of theoretical and practical confusions. Therefore, {{one of the main}} aims of this thesis is to analyze a securing bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> and examine and describe the different attributes and specifics that bind to it. Another main aim of this thesis is securing bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> to be compared with another hedging instruments which are provided by civil law, such as the pledge and the suretyship. Because of this comparison it is easier to show if the bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> is an appropriate securing instrument, and what are its strengths and weaknesses.

The aim of the thesis is to bring a comprehensive general view on the topic {{as well as to}} closely analyse the most important areas or those areas which are problematic from the legal point of view. The thesis is composed of six chapters. Chapter one deals with the law <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> in general.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> and {{promissory}} note I have chosen {{the topic of the}} Thesis "The {{concept of a}} bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> and promissory note" particularly {{due to the fact that}} I have become interested gradually in the issue <b>of</b> bills <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> and promissory notes and in particular bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> and promissory note essentials during the seminars of the commercial law and writing of the thesis has been an opportunity for me to extend my knowledge, concerning this institute.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} bills <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> It presents specific cases of their utilization in business relations {{and points to}} their advantages and disadvantages and to the related risks. An emphasis is put on and the own research {{that is based on}} the actual current practice. Four cases of bill utilization were examined, that finally lead to judicial recovery of the bill amount. Methods of qualitative research and non-standardized interviews were used. The results were subsequently processed in the form of descriptions of the individual cases and the individual cases were evaluated. The thesis also includes examples of the specific bills <b>of</b> <b>exchanges</b> discussed in the individual cases. The research has shown, among other things, that a bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> can be a very effective tool to secure receivables, however it can be also very treacherous. The law <b>of</b> bills <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> is not a simple one. Entrepreneurs who decide to participate in relations involving bills <b>of</b> <b>exchange,</b> either as bill holders or drawees, should very well consider whether they have all the information about what it actually means to issue a bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> or to accept it, what are the particulars of a bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> to be valid and which other risks are associated with the relations involving bills <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> As demonstrated by the presented cases, it is recommendable to turn to experts specializing in bills <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> law and thus to eliminate potential risks in the future. Among other things, this bachelor thesis also proves that, although business partners are equal in business relations, in relations involving bills <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> the bill holder has, as a rule, a slight advantage over the drawee. This naturally applies only on the condition that the concerned bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> is valid...|$|R

It deals with its particular characteristics which effectively distinguish a securing bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> from bills <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> fulfilling distinct functions, {{as well as from}} other securing instruments. The thesis provides its readers with a comprehensive view of the advantages the securing bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> has to offer within a variety of private legal relations. Simultaneously, it warns against the perils which are inherent thereto, both with respect to the creditors and the debtors. The thesis thereby emphasizes a necessity for at least a certain level of knowledge concerning the nature and potential of the securing bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange,</b> which would in practice help prevent misuse of this instrument and inflicting damage on the debtors. The first chapter focuses on the causal obligation of a debtor and a creditor and its connection to the bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> aiming to secure that relation.
