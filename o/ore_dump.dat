50|$|Low-grade {{gold ore}} may contain {{less than one}} ppm gold metal; such ore is ground and mixed with sodium cyanide to {{dissolve}} the gold. Cyanide is a highly poisonous chemical, which can kill living creatures when exposed in minute quantities. Many cyanide spills from gold mines have occurred in both developed and developing countries which killed aquatic life in long stretches of affected rivers. Environmentalists consider these events major environmental disasters. Thirty tons of used <b>ore</b> is <b>dumped</b> as waste for producing one troy ounce of gold. Gold <b>ore</b> <b>dumps</b> {{are the source of}} many heavy elements such as cadmium, lead, zinc, copper, arsenic, selenium and mercury. When sulfide bearing minerals in these <b>ore</b> <b>dumps</b> are exposed to air and water, the sulfide transforms into sulfuric acid which in turn dissolves these heavy metals facilitating their passage into surface water and ground water. This process is called acid mine drainage. These gold <b>ore</b> <b>dumps</b> are long term, highly hazardous wastes second only to nuclear waste dumps.|$|R

40|$|A {{manganese}} <b>ore</b> <b>dump</b> and {{oil tank}} farm have been {{situated in the}} Port Elizabeth harbour for more than forty years. Although these facilities are independently operated and managed, they are viewed as one distinct disamenity, and there is strong local opposition to their continued location in the harbour. The negative environmental impacts (for example, water and air pollution) caused by the <b>ore</b> <b>dump</b> and tank farm have been well documented. This pollution {{takes the form of}} oil leaks from the oil tank farm, and ore dust pollution from the manganese <b>ore</b> <b>dump.</b> The air pollution caused by the manganese <b>ore</b> <b>dump</b> {{is a result of the}} dump currently being an open air handling and storage facility. The ore dust is dispersed into the air due to strong prevailing winds in the Bay and has resulted in respiratory illnesses of residents living in close proximity to the facility. Oil pollution, due to leakages experienced at the oil tank farm, has extended far beyond the periphery of the harbour. Inter alia, there has been a decline in local fish populations, as well as a decline in passive and active use satisfaction associated with the adjacent beach area, i. e. Kings Beach. These oil leakages, first reported in 2001, could have a detrimental effect on the Blue Flag status of this beach, as well as the Blue Flag status of other beaches situated further up the coast. The lease agreements for the oil tank farm and manganese <b>ore</b> <b>dump</b> are set to expire in 2014 and 2016, respectively. As yet, there is no consensus on when these disamenities will be (re) moved. In order to mitigate the secondary impacts of these facilities, both of them should be removed. Although these impacts should be the focus of public policy debates and cost-benefit assessments, no direct valuation method exists to value the economic cost to affected communities. Instead, non-market valuation methods, such as the contingent valuation method (CVM), are often applied to assign values to these economic costs. This study seeks to determine Nelson Mandela Bay households‟ preferences for the immediate removal of the manganese <b>ore</b> <b>dump</b> and oil tank farm from the Port Elizabeth harbour. This case was selected since it represents a current public policy debate issue that has not been resolved. Monetary estimates of people‟s preferences for the removal of pollution-creating activities can assist policy-makers and other stakeholders when locating industries in an urban setting. These estimates can also be of use in understanding the benefits associated with air and water quality improvement projects. The primary valuation technique used in this study is the CVM. This method was chosen as it is capable of measuring the economic significance of lost passive-use values of individuals affected by negative externalities. Both a non-parametric and a parametric estimate of mean willingness-to-pay (WTP) were derived. On average, a respondent was willing to pay a once-off amount of between R 47. 09 (non-parametric estimate) and R 93. 21 (parametric estimate). Non-parametric estimation (via the Turnbull estimator) was conducted to test the sensitivity of the parametric results (via a logit model). The logit model‟s results showed that the probability of a „yes‟ answer to the referendum question varies with a number of covariates in a realistic and expected way, which offers some support for the construct validity of this CV study. Household income, education, age, and disamenity awareness were significant determinants of individuals‟ responses to the WTP question. A summary of the findings of WTP estimates for both parametric and non-parametric analysis is provided in Table 1. Three primary recommendations stem from this study. Firstly, the study used a relatively small sample size. Although it was sufficient for a pilot study it is recommended that future research into this issue should aim for a much larger sample size to ensure more precise estimates of the WTP for the removal of the disamenity. Secondly, the conservative non-parametric mean WTP estimate should be used as opposed to the higher parametric mean WTP estimate. Third, the aggregate WTP estimation constitutes only a partial analysis of cost. A number of other factors and value streams need to be analysed and compared with the cost estimates generated by this study if adequate holistic decision-making is to take place with regard to the removal of the manganese <b>ore</b> <b>dump</b> and oil tank farm. More specifically, the total WTP estimated in this study should be viewed as only one input into a comprehensive social cost-benefit analysis to determine the desirability of the removal of this disamenity for wider society...|$|E

The blow down and salamander tap were successfully completed and afterwards the furnace was quenched with water. All remaining liquids are solidified followed by excavation of the remaining skull. Copper {{was added to the}} last <b>ore</b> <b>dump</b> to distinguish the liquids prior to the quench. Around 300 holes were drilled in the skull, used for explosives. The cores were gathered and used for analysis. Several cores have been analyzed with X-ray fluorescence spectrometry; these rough data were the base of this study. Carbon lamellas were observed in certain areas of the skull. Their formation appears during slowly cooling of flowing hot metal. These lamellas confirm that part of the skull was solid previous to the blow down of blast furnace # 7. Radial variation of silicon is not detected. Results do show a distinct boundary, which separates material with different concentrations of copper. This is possibly a result of early solidification of the skull.

40|$|The average {{grades of}} copper mines are dropped by extracting {{high-grade}} copper ores. This matter has drawn considerations to processing methods {{which not only}} extracts low-grade copper ores but also decreases adverse environmental impacts. Hydrometallurgical methods are the most applicable ones which affect the optimum policy of cut-off grades determination. In this research, an optimum cut-off grades modeling is developed with the objective function of net present value (NPV) maximization. The costs of processing methods and associated environmental costs are also involved in the model. Next, limiting and balancing cut-off grades of processing methods are calculated through Lagrange multiplier optimization method. Finally, an iteration algorithm is exercised to compute {{the maximum amount of}} NPV as well as concentration and leaching optimum cut-off grades. The results show that the concentration and leaching optimum cut-off grades policy makes an improvement on overall NPV by 35 % in comparison with the traditional approaches of cut-off grades determination.

40|$|Background: Cavitation is {{a rather}} common and {{important}} effect in the processes of destruction of nano- and microscale particles in natural and technological processes. A possible cavitation disintegration of polymineral nano- and microparticles, which are placed into a liquid, {{as a result of}} the interaction of the particles with collapsed cavitation bubbles is considered. The emphasis is put on the cavitation processes on the interface between liquid and fine solid particles, which is suitable for the description of the real situations. Results: The results are illustrated for the minerals that are most abundant in gold ore. The bubbles are generated by shock loading of the liquid heated to the boiling temperature. Possibilities of cavitation separation of nano- and microscale monomineral fractions from polymineral nano- and microparticles and of the use of cavitation for beneficiation are demonstrated. Conclusion: The cavitation disintegration mechanism is important because the availability of high-grade deposits in the process of mining and production of noble metals is decreasing. This demands for an enhancement of the efficiency in developing low-grade deposits and in reprocessing <b>ore</b> <b>dumps</b> and tailings, which contain a certain amount of noble metals in the form of finely disseminated fractions. The cavitation processes occuring on the interface between liquid and fine solid particles are occasionally more effective than the bulk cavitation processes that were considered earlier...|$|R
50|$|The mine practises {{riverine}} tailings disposal, {{by which}} processed <b>ore</b> is <b>dumped</b> {{directly into the}} local river.

Sphalerite is {{the chief}} ore of zinc in all sulfide-rich base metal deposits. A broad range of trace and minor elements, some of them highly toxic (notably Cd, but also, Tl, As, Hg, etc), can occur in this mineral, often at levels that may pose an {{environmental}} hazard in abandoned <b>ore</b> <b>dumps</b> and mine tailings. Sphalerite is generally considered less reactive than pyrite but dissolution rates for the two minerals may neverthless be comparable. Unlike pyrite, sphalerite may even continue dissolving in a nonoxidizing conditions (Acero et al., 2007), increasing, therefore, the risk of toxic element release into the environment. T he Santa Manolita mine in El Losar del Barco (Ávila, Spain) is a small mining exploitation, abandoned several decades ago. In this area some waste rock piles, where sphalerite is a very abundant mineral, and vestiges of the mineral processing plant are still visible. This deposit is characterised by Pb-Ag (galena) and Zn (sphalerite) hydrothermal-type mineralization in quartz veins embedded in biotitic granite with high silicification (Mapa Geológico y Minero de Castilla y León, 1997).

40|$|In {{the late}} 1980 s people and {{businesses}} {{started to move}} out of Port Elizabeth's Central District (CBD). Businesses moved to the city's edge establishing new business zones, which in turn threatened the existence of the original CBD. Most inner city buildings became derelict and property prices dropped accordingly. Buildings were neglected and vandalized. This resulted in spaces which were unfit for human habitation and encouraged areas characterized by crime. The regeneration of Port Elizabeth's CDB is very important bacause of its historical value and key position. To build the Metropol the historical ideals of the CDB need to be revitalized, giving the city a administrative and cultural core which is both friendly and safe. A few proposals have been introduced to help uplift areas in the CDB. The latest initiative is the upgrading of Govan Mbeki Street lead by the firm The Matrix. Their aim is to create architecture that creates a more interactive, habitable environment. This would be achieved by more pedestrian orientated spaces, natural landscaping and facilitating vendors and craft markets. Future proposals are the removal of railway lines, the Tank Farm and finally the <b>Ore</b> <b>Dumps</b> to allow the city to expand eastwards. This will allow the city to grow and connect with the seafront and the existing harbour. Consequently {{the development of a new}} Railway Terminus is central to the establishment of a bay which is consistent with international standards of key marine cities in the modern world. The old station has a beautiful sense of place in Strand Street, as does the Campanile, which is at the gateway to the harbour. Together they offer a unique experience in this historiacal precinct.
