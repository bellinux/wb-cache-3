25|$|Henry IV, Part 1 is {{a history}} play by William Shakespeare, {{believed}} to have been written no later than 1597. It is the second play in Shakespeare's tetralogy dealing with the successive reigns of Richard II, Henry IV (two plays, including Henry IV, Part 2), and Henry V. Henry IV, Part 1 depicts a span <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>that</b> begins with Hotspur's battle at Homildon in Northumberland against Douglas late in 1402 and ends with the defeat of the rebels at Shrewsbury in the middle of 1403. From the start it has been an extremely popular play both with the public and critics.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Diamond co-edited (with James Robinson) Natural Experiments of History, a {{collection}} of seven case studies illustrating the multidisciplinary and comparative approach to the study <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>that</b> he advocates. The book’s title {{stems from the fact}} that it is not possible to study history by the preferred methods of the laboratory sciences, i.e., by controlled experiments comparing replicated human societies as if they were test tubes of bacteria. Instead, one must look at natural experiments in which human societies that are similar in many respects have been historically perturbed, either by different starting conditions or by different impacts. The book’s afterword classifies natural experiments, discusses the practical difficulties of studying them, and offers suggestions how to address those difficulties.|$|E
25|$|Gerry Canavan {{argues that}} Wild Seed {{challenges}} conventional fantasies of race by having Doro’s eugenics project supersede that of Europe’s by millennia. In this “alternate history,” “America itself--now {{transformed into a}} blip between the secret history of Doro's experiments and the brutal aftermath of their horrible success--becomes retold here as an African story, in an Africanist recentering <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>that</b> serves as a strongly anti-colonialist provocation, even if the results are mostly anti-utopian.” Still, while Doro’s eugenic project turns out a “superpowered blackness” that negates notions of white supremacy, his exploitation of his people as mere genetic experiments echoes the breeding methods of New World slave owners, thus replicating the actual history of racial slavery practiced by the Western world.|$|E

40|$|The quantum {{mechanics}} of closed {{systems such as}} the universe is formulated using an extension of familiar probability theory that incorporates negative probabilities. Probabilities must be positive for sets <b>of</b> alternative <b>histories</b> <b>that</b> are the basis of fair settleable bets. However, in {{quantum mechanics}} there are sets <b>of</b> alternative <b>histories</b> <b>that</b> can be described but which cannot {{be the basis for}} fair settleable bets. Members of such sets can be assigned extended probabilities that are sometimes negative. A prescription for extended probabilities is introduced that assigns extended probabilities to all <b>histories</b> <b>that</b> can be described, fine grained or coarse grained, members of decoherent sets or not. All probability sum rules are satisfied exactly. Sets <b>of</b> <b>histories</b> <b>that</b> are recorded to sufficient precision are the basis of settleable bets. This formulation is compared with the decoherent (consistent) <b>histories</b> formulation <b>of</b> quantum theory. Prospects are discussed for using this formulation to provide testable alternatives to quantum theory or further generalizations of it.

25|$|Historians {{tended to}} focus on {{individual}} salonnières, creating almost a 'great-woman' version <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>that</b> ran parallel to the Whiggish, male dominated history identified by Herbert Butterfield. Even in 1970, works were still being produced that concentrated only on individual stories, without analysing the effects of the salonnières' unique position. The integral role that women played within salons, as salonnières, began to receive greater - and more serious - study in latter parts of the 20th century, with the emergence of a distinctly feminist historiography. The salons, according to Carolyn Lougee, were distinguished by 'the very visible identification of women with salons', {{and the fact that they}} played a positive public role in French society. General texts on the Enlightenment, such as Daniel Roche's France in the Enlightenment tend to agree that women were dominant within the salons, but that their influence did not extend far outside of such venues.|$|E
25|$|Interest in {{environmental}} transformation {{continued to increase}} in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, resulting {{in a series of}} new intellectual approaches. One of these approaches was environmental determinism, developed by geographer Friedrich Ratzel. This view held that it is not social conditions, but environmental conditions, which determine the culture of a population. Ratzsel also viewed humans as restricted by nature, for their behaviors are limited to and defined by their environment. A later approach was the historical viewpoint of Franz Boas which refuted environmental determinism, claiming that it is not nature, but specifics <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> <b>that</b> shape human cultures. This approach recognized that although the environment may place limitations on societies, every environment will impact each culture differently. Julian Steward's cultural ecology is considered a fusion of environmental determinism and Boas' historical approach. Steward felt it was neither nature nor culture that had the most impact on a population, but instead, the mode of subsistence used in a given environment.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Sorge's {{reputation}} in West Germany in the 1950s {{was a highly}} negative one, with Sorge depicted as a traitor working for the Soviet Union {{who was responsible for}} the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Wehrmacht soldiers in the winter of 1941-42. The 1950s were a transition moment in the German memory of Nazi Germany as those Germans who had supported the Third Reich sought a version <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>that</b> presented them as victims rather than as followers of Hitler, portrayed Nazism as an aberration in German history that had no connections to traditional Prussian values, portrayed the Wehrmacht as an honorable fighting force that had nothing to do with the Holocaust, and presented the Soviets as guilty of crimes that even more horrific than those committed by the Nazis. Given this way of remembering the Nazi past in the 1950s, Operation Barbarossa and Germany's war in the East were seen as a heroic and legitimate war against the Soviet Union that Germans should not be ashamed of.|$|E

25|$|Kracht's 2012 novel Imperium follows on from Ich werde hier sein im Sonnenschein und im Schatten both in {{its very}} {{favourable}} reception by critics {{and in the way}} that it presents a reimagining <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>that</b> incorporates actual persons and historical reality while playing fast and loose with dates and details. In this sense the novel bears some similarity to Die Vermessung der Welt (Measuring the World) by Daniel Kehlmann, an author with whom Kracht corresponded while composing the distinctive narrative style of Imperium. The novel follows the travails of the historical figure August Engelhardt in the Bismarck Archipelago (now Papua New Guinea) {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century. Engelhardt is an idealistic German emigrant who establishes a plantation on an island and founds a colony of cocoivores – radical vegetarians nourished exclusively on coconuts. Engelhardt's history is interspersed with cameo appearances by other figures from German cultural history, such as Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka. The first of Kracht's novels not to be narrated in the first-person, the omniscient narrator informs us of the protagonist's thoughts and contextualises Engelhardt's life within the broader scope of twentieth-century history.|$|E

In her speech at the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Commission Forum, Perth, 10 August 2009, Oscar stated that Aboriginal leaders in the Valley had taken their first steps {{on the path of}} reconstructing their communities but now needed the government to support them:It is a story of colonisation; the threat of losing our cultural authority to manage our societies; and the despair that has come from that disempowerment.It is a story of grief and trauma and the continued pain of living with grog, drug and violence.It is a story that academics and journalists write about us as though we are victims <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>that</b> we can do nothing about. And within their stories about us is an acceptance that the paternal hand of government will determine the nature of our welfare and even the nature of our rights.… I want to tell a different story. It is about how Aboriginal people can be the authors of our stories and not passive and powerless subjects in stories told and written by others.… I want to talk about how the leaders of the Fitzroy Valley in the Kimberley are working together to create a pathway of hope and community vitality and resilience… if our journey of social reconstruction could be measured as a one kilometre track, we have only travelled the first metre.The start of the journey has depended on the leadership of the Aboriginal community but the journey from this point on will largely be shaped by a partnership that we can create and build with governments.|$|E
