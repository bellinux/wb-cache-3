50|$|The actual {{language}} {{of a local}} initiative measure itself should also be flexible, particularly {{as it relates to}} the effective and <b>operative</b> <b>dates</b> of the initiative. Delay tactics by a hostile local government, including legal challenges, can sometimes result in a significant delay in an initiative appearing on the ballot. The {{language of}} an initiative needs to be flexible enough to address such scenarios so that if the initiative were to be approved by the voters any resulting delays in ballot qualification will not adversely impact the substantive provisions of the measure.|$|R

To <b>date,</b> described methods of temporary extremity blood perfusion have required open surgical techniques. MethodsAn endovascular shunt (ES) was formed by connecting two introducer sheaths to each other, one positioned proximal and one distal to an arterial obstruction. The ES method was used in patients considered to be at high risk for prolonged lower limb ischemia in conjunction with a vascular procedure and where shunt creation by open surgical technique was not considered to be a practical alternative. The flow capacity of the ES was defined in a desktop model. ResultsThe ES method was used clinically in 15 vascular interventions including eight complex endovascular aortic procedures, three open aortic operations, and four procedures for acute limb ischemia. The shunts were functional in all patients and there were no shunt occlusions. Postoperatively, there were no evident clinical reperfusion injuries. Flow analysis revealed that the ES had a flow capacity of 73 % flow capacity compared to a Pruitt-Inahara shunt.

The presence of pain was classified as any level of pain that prevented the patients from returning to their pre-operative level of function. When patients were noted to have functional pain, use of crutches, or lacked full range of motion at the two-week post-operative visit, they were label as having delayed return of function. Any patients who received physical therapy due to delayed return of function were tracked for resolution of symptoms during their subsequent follow-up appointments.|$|E

40|$|Source of support: Departmental sources Background: Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} the efficacy of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (rhBMP- 2) in 2 -level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the outcomes in a series of patients with CSM treated with 2 -level ACDF with or without rhBMP- 2. Material/Methods: The retrospective study included a total of 146 patients with CSM. The rhBMP- 2 group consisted of 73 patients who underwent 2 -level ACDF with rhBMP- 2. A total of 73 patients who also received 2 -level ACDF with autoge-nous ICBG alone were included in the matched-pair ICBG group with a ratio of 1 : 1, based on age, sex, and BMI. All data, including fusion rate and time, VAS, JOA score, <b>operative</b> <b>date,</b> and complications, were assessed. Results: With respect to the length of hospital stay, operative times, and blood loss, there were no significant difference between the 2 groups. However, the rhBMP- 2 group presented a shorter fusion time (P< 0. 013) and higher fu-sion rate (P< 0. 036) than the ICBG group. In the rhBMP- 2 group, 22 % required additional treatment for compli-cations compared to 18 % of patients in the ICBG group, which showed no significant difference (P= 0. 543).

40|$|ObjectivesAmong {{patients}} undergoing {{aortic valve}} surgery for chronic aortic regurgitation (AR), we sought to: 1) compare survival {{among those with}} and without severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVD); 2) identify risk factors for death, including LVD and date of operation; and 3) estimate contemporary risk for cardiomyopathic patients. BackgroundPatients with chronic AR and severe LVD have been considered high risk for aortic valve surgery, with limited prognosis. Transplantation is considered for some. MethodsFrom 1972 to 1999, 724 patients underwent surgery for chronic AR; 88 (12 %) had severe LVD. They were propensity matched to patients with nonsevere LVD to compare hospital mortality, interaction of <b>operative</b> <b>date</b> with severity of LVD, and late survival. Propensity score-adjusted multivariable analysis was performed for all 724 patients to identify risk factors for death. ResultsSurvival was lower (p = 0. 04) among patients with severe LVD than among matched patients with nonsevere LVD (30 -day, 1 -, 5 -, and 25 -year survival estimates were 91 % vs. 96 %, 81 % vs. 92 %, 68 % vs. 81 %, and 5 % vs. 12 %, respectively). However, survival of patients with severe LVD improved dramatically across the study time frame (p = 0. 0004) : hospital mortality decreased from 50 % in 1975 to 0 % after 1985, and time-related survival in patients with severe LVD operated on since 1985 became equivalent to that of matched patients with nonsevere LVD (p = 0. 96). ConclusionsNeutralizing risk of severe LVD has improved early and late survival such that aortic valve surgery for chronic AR and cardiomyopathy {{is no longer a}} high-risk procedure for which transplantation is the best option...|$|E
40|$|Transactions (sales) and use taxes {{imposed by}} certain special taxing districts are {{administered}} by the State Board of Equalization. These taxes incorporate most of {{the provisions of the}} state Sales and Use Tax Law and generally have the same tax base as the Bradley-Burns uniform local sales and use taxes adopted in accordance with the provisions of Part 1. 5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. The primary differences between the transactions (sales) and use taxes and the state and Bradley-Burns uniform local sales and use taxes are: (1) The transactions (sales) tax of a district is not applicable to the gross receipts from the sale or lease of tangible personal property which the seller or the lessor is obligated to furnish for a fixed price pursuant to a contract entered into prior to the <b>operative</b> <b>date</b> of the district transactions (sales) and use taxes ordinance. (2) The transactions (sales) tax does not apply to gross receipts from the sale of property to be used outside the district when the property is shipped to a point outside the district, pursuant to the contract of sale, by delivery to such point by the retailer or his agent, or by delivery by the retailer to a carrier for shipment to a consignee at such point. If thereafter the purchaser brings the property into the district for use there and uses it there, the district use tax may apply and the purchaser may be required to pay that tax. (3) The use tax of a district is not applicable to the storage, use or other consumption in the district of tangibl...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThe Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services {{recently}} began assessing financial penalties to hospitals with high readmission rates for a narrow set of medical conditions. Because these penalties will {{be extended to}} surgical conditions in the near future, we sought to determine whether readmissions are a reliable predictor of hospital performance with vascular surgery. MethodsWe examined 4  years of national Medicare claims data from 1576 hospitals on beneficiaries undergoing three common vascular procedures: open or endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (n = 81, 520) or lower extremity arterial bypass (n = 57, 190). First, we divided our population into two groups {{on the basis of}} <b>operative</b> <b>date</b> (2005 - 2006 and 2007 - 2008) and generated hospital risk- and reliability-adjusted readmission rates for each time period. We evaluated reliability through the use of the “test-retest” method; highly reliable measures will show little variation in rates over time. Specifically, we evaluated the year-to-year reliability of readmissions by calculating Spearman rank correlation and weighted κ tests for readmission rates between the two time periods. ResultsThe Spearman coefficient between 2005 - 2006 readmissions rankings and 2007 - 2008 readmissions rankings was 0. 57 (P <. 001) and weighted κ was 0. 42 (P <. 001), indicating a moderate correlation. However, only 32 % of the variation in hospital readmission rates in 2007 - 2008 was explained by readmissions during the 2 prior years. There were major reclassifications of hospital rankings between years, with 63 % of hospitals migrating among performance quintiles between 2005 - 2006 and 2007 - 2008. ConclusionsRisk-adjusted readmission rates for vascular surgery vary substantially year to year; this implies that much of the observed variation in readmission rates is either random or caused by unmeasured factors and not caused by changes in hospital quality that may be captured by administrative data...|$|E

Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact {{on state and}} local governments: There will be both one time and ongoing fiscal effects. One time fiscal effects: (1) A potential cost of approximately $ 1. 29 billion to pay property tax refunds. These would be paid by the state ($ 508 million), local property taxpayers through higher levies for debt service (up to $ 158 million), and local governments ($ 624 million). (2) The state will gain about $ 75 million over a two year period in increased state income tax revenues because the property tax refunds and interest will be taxable income. Ongoing fiscal effects: (1) Annual revenue losses of at least $ 41 million to local governments and $ 25 million to school districts resulting from the provisions regarding inflationary adjustments to assessed valuations. The revenue losses to schools would be offset by comparable increased state funding. (2) Unknown but probably major ongoing gains in state income tax revenues. (3) Unknown annual multimillion dollar costs and revenue losses {{to state and local}} governments due to tax rate limitations; assessments practices changes; voting requirements for tax legislation; and the definitions of taxes, fees, and assessments contained in the measure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to determine significant {{risk factors for}} proximal or distal reoperations after surgical correction of acute type A aortic dissection. Methods: Between 1980 and 2000, a total of 160 consecutive patients (mean age 57. 5 ± 13. 3 years, 126 men) underwent surgery for acute type A aortic dissection. Proximal repair was performed by means of ascending aorta replacement with valve resuspension in 130 cases (81. 3 %), composite graft replacement in 19 cases (11. 9 %), separate aortic valve and ascending aorta replacement in 7 cases (4. 4 %), and aortic repair in 1 case (0. 6 %). Distal repair required arch replacement in 23 cases. Follow-up time averaged 4. 51 ± 5. 6 years per patient. Results: Survival estimates after initial operation were 66. 1 % ± 3. 8 %, 57. 7 % ± 4. 2 %, 52. 2 % ± 4. 6 %, and 42. 5 % ± 5. 8 % at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Thirty patients required 37 reoperations at a mean interval of 5. 7 ± 4. 5 years after the initial operation. Freedoms from reoperation were 96. 9 % ± 1. 8 %, 74. 7 % ± 5. 3 %, 60. 8 % ± 6. 8 %, and 39. 3 % ± 9. 1 % at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Reoperations included procedures on the proximal aorta (aortic root or valve) in 21 cases and on the distal aorta or its side branches in 19 cases. Cox regression analysis distinguished severe preoperative aortic valve insufficiency as the only significant risk factors for proximal reoperation; younger patient age, more distal extent of dissection, and more recent <b>operative</b> <b>date</b> {{were found to be}} significant risk factors for distal reoperation. Conclusion: Patients with acute type A aortic dissection who have severe aortic valve insufficiency are at increased risk for proximal reoperation. These patients should benefit from a more aggressive proximal repair at initial operation. Distal extent of aortic resection at initial operation did not significantly influence the risk of distal reoperation...|$|E
