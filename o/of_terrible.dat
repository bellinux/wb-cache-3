5|$|As Doggett {{approaches}} {{the body of}} Jeb's latest victim, he has a flashback of when he found Luke's body. Doggett storms off, but Reyes refuses to let it go, finally revealing her theory: she believes that the boy's murder {{was part of a}} “thread of evil,” an interconnected series <b>of</b> <b>terrible</b> events. Meanwhile, Katha returns home with her daughter and finds Jeb there. He insists that it wasn't him who committed the murder, and pleads to his sister for help. Katha calls the agents and tries to separate her daughter from Jeb, but he realizes what she is planning and uses his niece as a hostage. Before Jeb can shoot Doggett, Reyes incapacitates him with a round to the throat.|$|E
5|$|Veronica gets an {{invitation}} to Norris's house, but she doesn't find any weapons. Veronica calls Mac to help her break into the WiFi before she sees Pete {{in front of the}} house. The ATF searches Norris's vehicle and finds fertilizer and a rifle, despite Veronica's convictions that he is not the perpetrator. However, Veronica recognizes them as being the same ones Ben was loading into his car earlier. Veronica calls Pete, and she tells him that she knows he falsely implicated Norris (with the help of the ATF agent) because <b>of</b> <b>terrible</b> bullying in junior high. Meg tells Veronica that Duncan has disappeared after removing $10,000 from the bank. The story involving Norris is published in the newspaper, and, although it leads to all charges against Norris being dropped, it also results in the new journalism teacher's (Joey Lauren Adams) termination.|$|E
5|$|While the {{persecution}} under Constantius was relatively light, {{there is no}} doubt about the force of {{the persecution}} in Maximian's domain. Its effects are recorded at Rome, Sicily, Spain, and in Africaindeed, Maximian encouraged particularly strict enforcement of the edict in Africa. Africa's political elite were insistent that the persecution be fulfilled, and Africa's Christians, especially in Numidia, were equally insistent on resisting them. For the Numidians, to hand over scriptures was an act <b>of</b> <b>terrible</b> apostasy. Africa had long been home to the Church of the Martyrsin Africa, martyrs held more religious authority than the clergyand harbored a particularly intransigent, fanatical, and legalistic variety of Christianity. It was Africa that gave the West most of its martyrdoms.|$|E

25|$|After {{several years}} of stale combat in various regions of Transcaucasia, with neither parties making {{significant}} territorial gains, the Russians had gained the upper hand and by now had reached territories close to Persia's heartlands. On December 18, 1812 the marching military detachment of general Kotlyarevsky had crossed the Aras river and had passed the 80 miles straight without water and roads through the Mughan plains through salt flats and swamps. After crossing swamps and marshes, the soldiers were then transferred to a weather <b>of</b> <b>terrible</b> snow and blizzard. By that time, his army had undergone a heavy need for resupplies especially drinking water and food.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, {{the enemy}} is forced to attack the {{defensive}} trenches with conventional infantry assault (as during World War I) at the cost <b>of</b> <b>terrible</b> losses, without assistance of armored forces or line-of-sight firing guns. Because {{of the possibility of}} redeployment, significantly less manpower is required than the Maginot-like defenses. The semi-mobile engagement also psychologically preferable than the claustrophobic feeling of Maginot-like bunkers in long term. This type of defensive line required 5-10 times less manpower and concrete per kilometer than the Maginot or Siegfried line with equal (or more) effectiveness, but far more imagination is required from the builders because every part of the line were inevitably unique design adapted to local conditions.|$|E
25|$|The Peace of Saint-Germain {{put an end}} {{to three}} years <b>of</b> <b>terrible</b> civil war between Catholics and Protestants. This peace, however, was {{precarious}} since the more intransigent Catholics refused to accept it. The Guise family (strongly Catholic) was out of favour at the French court; the Huguenot leader, Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, was readmitted into the king's council in September 1571. Staunch Catholics were shocked by the return of Protestants to the court, but the queen mother, Catherine de' Medici, and her son, Charles IX, were practical in their support of peace and Coligny, as they were conscious of the kingdom's financial difficulties and the Huguenots' strong defensive position: they controlled the fortified towns of La Rochelle, La Charité-sur-Loire, Cognac, and Montauban.|$|E
25|$|St. Petersburg {{was built}} by Peter the Great at the {{beginning}} of the eighteenth century, on the swampy shores and islands of the Neva. The difficulties of construction were numerous, but Peter was unperturbed by the expenditure of human life required to fulfill his vision of a city on the coast. Of the artisans whom he compelled to come north to lay the foundations of the city, thousands died of hardship and disease; and the city, in its unnatural location, was at the mercy <b>of</b> <b>terrible</b> floods caused by the breaking-up of the ice of the Lake Ladoga just east of it or- as on the occasion described in the poem- by the west wind blowing back the Neva. There had been one such devastating flood in 1777 and again in 1824, during Pushkin’s time and the flood modeled in the poem, and they continue to this day.|$|E

25|$|The Interstate {{highways}} in {{the state}} are Interstate95 (I-95; the Connecticut Turnpike) traveling southwest to northeast along the coast, I-84 traveling southwest to northeast {{in the center of}} the state, I-91 traveling north to south {{in the center of the}} state, and I-395 traveling north to south near the eastern border of the state. The other major highways in Connecticut are the Merritt Parkway and Wilbur Cross Parkway, which together form Connecticut Route 15 (Route15), traveling from the Hutchinson River Parkway in New York parallel to I-95 before turning north of New Haven and traveling parallel to I-91, finally becoming a surface road in Berlin. I-95 and Route15 were originally toll roads; they relied on a system of toll plazas at which all traffic stopped and paid fixed tolls. A series <b>of</b> <b>terrible</b> crashes at these plazas eventually contributed to the decision to remove the tolls in 1988. Other major arteries {{in the state}} include U.S. Route7 (US7) in the west traveling parallel to the New York state line, Route8 farther east near the industrial city of Waterbury and traveling north–south along the Naugatuck River Valley nearly parallel with US7, and Connecticut Route 9 in the east.|$|E
25|$|The protagonists {{make their}} way to Firsthome and the Court, but are treated there with {{relative}} indifference. They pick up a new friend, Roofshadow, and go northwest. They are captured by a group of evil cats called the Clawguard, and taken to Vastnir, an enormous mound far to the north, where the evil cat-god Grizraz Hearteater enslaves cats to take over the world, swollen in size and sitting upon a mound of dead and dying creatures. Tailchaser needs to alert the outside world and especially the court about his evil doings. Soon, Roofshadow creates a hole from above ground, and Tailchaser manages to escape, and races to Ratleaf Forest, where he asks a clan of squirrels to alert them for him in repayment for a debt contracted with their lord's brother. He feels guilty with Pouncequick, Eatbugs, and Roofshadow trapped in Vastnir because of him. He returns to the dreadful mound, where Quiverclaw and Prince Fencewalker, whom he had met at the court, come to the rescue. Lord Hearteater creates the Fikos, a dog-like monster <b>of</b> <b>terrible</b> power, out of the mound of dying creatures he had been sitting on. Tailchaser takes advantage of the chaos to rescue Pouncequick, Eatbugs, and Roofshadow. They go through the havoc of Vastnir, and lose Eatbugs, the mad cat, on the way. Roofshadow and Pouncequick escape while Tailchaser goes back to find Eatbugs. He goes into a crevice and sees Eatbugs in a near-deathlike state, and feels dazed and confused. Upon Tailchaser's uttering a prayer to Lord Tangaloor Firefoot, Hearteater's brother, Eatbugs awakens, revealing himself to actually be Firefoot incognito. Tailchaser runs out of Vastnir at Firefoot's urging, and meets his friends, while Firefoot goes to deal with Hearteater, resulting in the destruction of Vastnir.|$|E

500|$|Veteran US Olympic riders such as Michael Page and Mike Huber cite Le Goff {{as having}} a large impact on American eventing.

[...] The 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s are known as the US's [...] "golden age of equestrian sports", with Le Goff being named as {{a major player in}} the eventing arena. Denny Emerson, another top US eventing rider, called Le Goff a [...] "tactician, consensus builder, consummate horseman, outrageous flirt, teller <b>of</b> <b>terrible</b> jokes, promoter, master chef, father, fisherman, and probably that most defining persona of all, the quintessential French male bon vivant." ...|$|E

Open Salon praised Torv's performance this season, {{and thought it was}} a [...] "very thought-provoking episode, with some major implications for Peter and Olivia's relationship moving forward". Alex Zalben of UGO Networks, however, called the episode the [...] "first clunker of the season" [...] because despite approving of the plot and the acting, the [...] "writing was uniformly obvious, stilted and kind <b>of</b> <b>terrible...</b> there were more head-slappingly stupid moments than I could count". SFScope's Sarah Stegall noted similarities to the film Blade Runner, and predicted that the consummation of their relationship would cause Peter to discover Fauxlivia's true identity.|$|E

Luke Thompson of the Dallas Observer found it [...] "a waste of a decent premise"; Ernest Hardy of LA Weekly said {{that the film}} [...] "fails because it takes itself both too seriously and not seriously enough".

500|$|The Binding of Isaac {{has been}} {{received}} by reviewers {{as a game}} with high replayability with the extensive range and combinations of power-ups that the player can encounter during a run-through, while providing an accessible Zelda-inspired framework that most video game players would recognize and easily come to understand. John Teti for Eurogamer praised the game for its replayability through the randomization aspects, calling it [...] "the most accessible exploration of the roguelike idea" [...] that he had seen. Edges similarly commented on the lure to replay the game due to its short playthrough time, calling it [...] "an imaginative and quick-witted arcade experience that manages to be both depraved and strangely sweet by turn". GameSpot's Maxwell McGee stated that the game smartly has removed extraneous features such that [...] "what remains is a tightly focused game that continues to feel fresh even after multiple completions". Though the game {{is considered to be}} accessible to new players, reviewers found the game to be a difficult challenge, often set by the randomness of what power-ups the player happened to acquire during a single run. Writers for The A.V. Club rated the game an A on a grading scale, and favorably compared the title to McMillen's Super Meat Boy, requiring the player to have [...] "masochistic patience in the face <b>of</b> <b>terrible</b> odds". This difficulty was considered mitigated by the large number of possible power-ups that the game offers, most would not be seen by players until they have replayed the game many times. McGee noted that while players can review what items they have discovered prior to a run-through, this feature does not explain what each item does, leaving the effect to be determined by the player while in game.|$|E
