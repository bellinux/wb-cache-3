5|$|Gibraltar {{was part}} of a 17-ship squadron, keeping four French ships-of-the-line in Fort Royal, Martinique, when on 29April 1781 a 20-ship fleet and a {{merchant}} convoy under Contre-amiral François deGrasse arrived from Brest. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> of the British, deGrasse put a man ashore to swap information with Fort Royal's garrison, and agree on a plan of attack with the blockaded ships.|$|E

His best way would be to avoid Manchester, and go over Kersal moor and Agecroft bridge; and as I had a relation in that quarter who wished to see me, I would keep him company as far as Agecroft.|$|E
5|$|Before leaving, Shackleton {{instructed}} Frank Wild {{that he was}} {{to assume}} full command as soon as the James Caird departed, and that should the journey fail, he was to attempt to take the party to Deception Island the following spring. The James Caird was launched from Elephant Island on 24 April 1916. The wind was a moderate south-westerly, which aided a swift getaway, and the boat was quickly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> of the land.|$|E

5|$|Despite Stroheim's {{reputation}} as a perfectionist, Greed contains anachronisms. In the scenes on Polk Street, the main characters are clothed in 1890s fashions, but the extras wear 1920s clothing. Stroheim {{did his best to}} avoid such historical mistakes; he shot only those buildings that were from the era Greed was set in, and he kept motor vehicles <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> while filming. Daniels stated that, despite his desire for authenticity, Stroheim sometimes had walls knocked out of real locations to achieve a desired camera position.|$|E
5|$|Endeavour then resumed her voyage westward {{along the}} coast, picking {{a path through}} {{intermittent}} shoals and reefs {{with the help of}} the pinnace, which was rowed ahead to test the water depth. By 26 August she was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> of land, and had entered the open waters of the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, earlier navigated by Luis Váez de Torres in 1606. To keep Endeavours voyages and discoveries secret, Cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and ordered them to remain silent about where they had been.|$|E
5|$|Human {{language}} is also unique {{in being able}} to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events {{that took place in the}} past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement, and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of bees that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight),</b> the degree to which it is used in human {{language is}} also considered unique.|$|E

5|$|In {{more recent}} years, the {{original}} Piagetian object permanence account {{has been challenged}} {{by a series of}} infant studies suggesting that much younger infants do have a clear sense that objects exist even when <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> Bower showed object permanence in 3-month-olds. This goes against Piaget's coordination of secondary circular reactions stage because infants aren't supposed to understand that a completely hidden object still exists until they are eight to twelve months old. The two studies below demonstrate this idea.|$|E
5|$|On the {{northern}} end of the battlefield, events had unfolded quite differently. Dampierre's cavalry routed Lannoy's company of light horse; the Italians and the contingent from Gruyères, meanwhile, broke and fled—leaving their officers to be killed—without offering any real resistance to the advancing Imperial infantry. As Cardona's infantry moved past the original French line, Enghien descended on it with the entire body of heavy cavalry under his command; the subsequent engagement took place on the reverse slope of the ridge, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> {{of the rest of the}} battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Producer Nancy Tenenbaum {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the short film. After she sent a copy of the original film to several people of interest, filmmaker Steven Soderbergh replied that he was interested and that he wanted to direct a remake. He brought it to the attention of Universal Studios who initially declined but subsequently optioned {{the rights to the}} film in 1995. Soderbergh took on the project but then dropped it when he got involved with <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sight.</b>|$|E

5|$|Since {{much of the}} {{criticism}} {{is the result of}} photos and videos taken during the hunt and slaughter, it is now common for the final capture and slaughter to take place on site inside a tent or under a plastic cover, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> from the public. The most circulated footage is probably that of the drive and subsequent capture and slaughter process taken in Futo in October 1999 (a still of which can be seen on the right), shot by the Japanese animal welfare organization Elsa Nature Conservancy. Part of this footage was, amongst others, shown on CNN.|$|E
5|$|Social rodents have a {{wider range}} of vocalizations than do solitary species. Fifteen {{different}} call-types have been recognized in adult Kataba mole rats and four in juveniles. Similarly, the common degu, another social, burrowing rodent, exhibits a wide array of communication methods and has an elaborate vocal repertoire comprising fifteen different categories of sound. Ultrasonic calls play a part in social communication between dormice and are used when the individuals are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> of each other.|$|E
5|$|A mountainside, at the magician's cavern. Goffredo and Eustazio {{are told}} by the Magician that Almirena is being held captive in Armida's palace at the mountain-top. Ignoring the magician's warning that they will need special powers, the pair set off for the palace but are quickly driven back by Armida's monsters. The magician then gives them magic wands that transcend Armida's power, and they set off again. This time they {{overcome}} the monsters, but as they reach {{the gates of the}} palace it disappears, leaving them clinging to a rock {{in the midst of a}} stormy sea. They climb the rock and descend <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b>|$|E

5|$|Animals may avoid {{becoming}} prey {{by living}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> of predators, whether in caves, underground, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity {{during the night}} and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} his {{leadership}} and his coup d'œil, {{the ability to see}} at a glance what needed to be done, occurred after the Battle of Kolin. The loss at Kolin forced the King to lift the siege at Prague. The King's brother, Augustus William, took command of the army and ordered the retreat from Prague. Seydlitz was attached to the advanced corps of Karl Christoph von Schmettau in a brigade of ten squadrons. As Seydlitz's wing entered Lusatia, near the town of Zittau, the Austrians were present in force, and Seydlitz with his squadrons were trapped in the town. Tricking the Austrians into thinking his troop was a foraging party, his cavalry burst on the Austrian cavalry before they could climb into their saddles. Seydlitz led his cavalry in an escape, in close column, and was quickly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, none aboard Centaur {{witnessed}} what had attacked the ship. Due to the ship's position, the distance from shore, and the depth, it was concluded that she was torpedoed by one of the Japanese submarines known to be operating off the Australian east coast. Several survivors later claimed to have heard the attacking submarine moving on the surface while they were adrift, and the submarine was seen by the ship's cook, Francis Martin, who was floating alone on a hatch cover, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> from the main cluster of survivors. Martin described the submarine to Naval Intelligence following the survivors' return to land; his description matched the profile of a KD7 type Kaidai-class submarine of the Imperial Japanese Navy.|$|E

5|$|Five police officers, {{who volunteered}} {{to carry out the}} execution, were each paid $300. The {{shooters}} used identical Winchester Model 94 rifles. One prison official selected each rifle at random from a table and handed them to another prison official sitting in a small room, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> The second prison official would then load the rifle, and return it to the table. Four of the rifles were loaded with live ammunition. One was secretly loaded with a wax bullet so that none of the officers would be certain that they fired a deadly shot. The non-lethal cartridge was tested to ensure that the report and recoil was difficult to distinguish from a real cartridge.|$|E
5|$|Regarding {{the aerial}} imagery that the U.S. report said {{suggested}} a lower death toll, the South Korean investigators, drawing on accounts from survivors and area residents, {{said that at}} least 62 bodies had been taken away by relatives, or buried in soldiers' abandoned foxholes, {{in the first days}} after the killings, and others remained inside one underpass tunnel, under thin layers of dirt, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> of airborne cameras, and awaiting later burial in mass graves. In addition, South Korean military specialists questioned the U.S. reconnaissance photos, pointing out irregularities, including the fact that the No Gun Ri frames had been spliced into the roll of film, raising the possibility that they were not, as claimed, from August 6, 1950, eight days after the killings.|$|E
5|$|Scott Frank {{was hired}} to write the {{screenplay}} in February 1999, after approaching Warner Bros. for the job. Frank, a recent Oscar nominee for the R-rated crime film <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sight,</b> wanted {{to work on a}} film that his children could enjoy. As an enthusiastic fan of the book, he intended to remain more truthful to Dahl's vision than the 1971 film had been. Nicolas Cage was under discussions for Willy Wonka, but lost interest. Gary Ross signed to direct in February 2000, which resulted in Frank completing two drafts of the screenplay, before leaving with Ross in September 2001. Both Warner Bros. and the Dahl Estate wanted Frank to stay on the project, but he faced scheduling conflicts and contractual obligations with Minority Report (2002) and The Lookout (2007).|$|E
