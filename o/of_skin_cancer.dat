40|$|Organ {{transplant}} recipients (OTR) are at {{significantly increased}} risk {{to develop a}} wide variety <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancers,</b> particularly epithelial <b>skin</b> <b>cancer,</b> Merkel cell carcinoma and Kaposi's sarcoma. In addition, melanoma, skin adnexal neoplasm and cutaneous lymphomas are more common in OTR and may differ in their clinicopathological presentation from tumors in immunocompetent patients. The accuracy of clinical diagnosis of suspected premalignant and malignant skin lesions in OTR is modest. Therefore, histopathological diagnosis is an essential element for the diagnostic workup <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancers,</b> and additionally provides important information on prognosis. This review discusses the histopathological aspects <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> in OTR, the impact of dermatopathological analysis on prognosis {{and understanding of the}} pathogenesis of these neoplasms...|$|R

The abilities of modern oncology in the treatment <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> are significantly expanded by photodynamic therapy. Photodynamic therapy is a fundamentally new method of treatment of malignant tumors based on the photodynamic damaging of tumor cells in the photochemical reaction.

5|$|In early 2008, he was {{diagnosed}} with malignant melanoma, a severe form <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancer.</b> He had fought the disease before, when he had a form <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> removed from his back in 2006. Cooksey suspected his cancer originated from a six-month spell coaching schoolchildren in the searing heat of Las Vegas in the United States. In April 2008, Grays Athletic staged a benefit match for Cooksey. The match consisted of former professional players, as well as current professionals such as Leroy Lita, Nicky Shorey, Aaron McLean, Ray Parlour, Justin Edinburgh, Iain Dowie, Bob Dowie, Clive Allen, Scott Fitzgerald and Paul Merson. He returned to his former club Oldham Athletic in May 2008, where another benefit match was staged for his appeal at Boundary Park, attended by 1,500 fans to see such former players as John Barnes, Luther Blissett and Chris Waddle as well as television actors from Coronation Street.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Skin</b> <b>cancer</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} {{prevalent}} cancers {{in the world and}} is known as the first or second common malignancy in different parts of Iran. According to preventable nature of most types <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> and because <b>of</b> the lack of data about this cancer in Khuzestan province, this study was done to evaluate the frequency <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> in the southwest of Iran and its relationship to sun exposure. Materials and Methods: Data of demographic characteristics such as age, gender, type of cancer and its body location was extracted from pathologically confirmed Khuzestan Cancer Center which was during Mars 2009 -Mars 2010. Results: From 5201 of cancers recorded, 602 were <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> (mean <b>of</b> age: 61 y/o). All types <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> were higher in men (n = 348, 56. 8 %, P = 0. 03) and 40 years and older (P < 0. 001). Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) was seen in 424 patients (70. 4 %), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in 85 patients, and malignant melanoma in 22, and other <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> in 71 patients. <b>Skin</b> <b>cancer</b> type was statistically correlated to skin's topography and sunlightexposure (SCC and BCC were higher in sun-exposed areas (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: According to Khuzestan's geographic location, most days are sunny, and most of the peoplework outdoor (farmers or petroleum workers) and because of the great role <b>of</b> sunlight in <b>skin</b> <b>cancer,</b> we suggest more educational programs regarding using sun screens, sunglasses, suitable hats and cloths and avoiding from sun-exposure when direct sunlight is expected...|$|R
40|$|Background: Incidence <b>of</b> nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> and actinic keratoses {{appears to}} be {{increasing}} worldwide due to increasing levels of ultraviolet radiation, lifestyle changes, and an aging population. Because of its demographics and geographic location, the population of South Florida is at risk for high rates <b>of</b> nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> and actinic keratoses. Objective: To determine the incidence <b>of</b> nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> and actinic keratoses in two populations in South Florida by measuring treatments by dermatologists in health maintenance organization gatekeeper populations. Methods: The incidence <b>of</b> nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> and actinic keratoses in South Florida was determined by evaluating the number <b>of</b> nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> and actinic keratoses treated by dermatologists (Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] Code Analysis) in two health maintenance organization populations; “commercial” (age 0 – 65, mean 27) and Medicare (age 65 +, mean 68) in the calendar year 1996. Results: The incidence of treatment <b>of</b> nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> was 466. 5 per 100, 000 people {{per year in the}} “commercial” (age 0 to 65) population and 10, 689. 8 per 100, 000 people per year in the Medicare age population. The incidence of treated actinic keratoses was 4, 464. 6 per 100, 000 people per year and 110, 450. 3 in each population respectively. Conclusion: The studied populations in South Florida appear to have some of the highest incidence rates <b>of</b> nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> in the world and extremely high rates of actinic keratoses. The findings suggest that there is an epidemic <b>of</b> nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> in the South Florida community, which has significant implications for the future medical needs of both “commercial” and Medicare-age populations...|$|R

40|$|Background: Organ {{transplant}} recipients have {{an increased}} risk <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancers.</b> A specialist dermatology clinic for renal transplant recipients (RTRs) was established in 2005.

Methods: <b>Skin</b> <b>cancer</b> data for RTRs attending the transplant dermatology clinic over a 38 -month period were collected and recorded in the West of Scotland electronic renal patient record. <b>Skin</b> <b>cancer</b> data were intrinsically linked to each individual’s transplant and immunosuppression data.

40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} {{is an important}} risk factor for the development <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancers.</b> Melanin is known to protect the skin against harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation. Hence, vitiligo patients are at higher risk of developing such malignancies. But few reports <b>of</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> in vitiligo lesions suggest that their occurrence in vitiligo is rare. There are reports of development of Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in vitiligo lesions, following long-term Psoralen and Ultraviolet-A (PUVA) therapy. But there are no reports of occurrence of SCC in a vitiligo patch located in photo-covered area. We describe a patient with SCC in a vitiligo patch present in photo-covered skin...|$|R

25|$|Since {{the ozone}} layer absorbs UVB {{ultraviolet}} light from the sun, ozone layer depletion increases surface UVB levels (all else equal), {{which could lead to}} damage, including increase in skin cancer. This was the reason for the Montreal Protocol. Although decreases in stratospheric ozone are well-tied to CFCs and to increases in surface UVB, there is no direct observational evidence linking ozone depletion to higher incidence <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> and eye damage in human beings. This is partly because UVA, which has also been implicated in some forms <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancer,</b> is not absorbed by ozone, and because it is nearly impossible to control statistics for lifestyle changes over time.|$|E

25|$|Light therapy using {{ultraviolet}} light has tentative support {{but the quality}} of the evidence is not very good.

25|$|The {{most deadly}} form <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancer,</b> {{malignant}} melanoma, is mostly caused by DNA damage independent from UVA radiation. This {{can be seen}} from the absence of a direct UV signature mutation in 92% of all melanoma. Occasional overexposure and sunburn are probably greater risk factors for melanoma than long-term exposure. UVC is the highest-energy, most-dangerous type of ultraviolet radiation, and causes adverse effects that can variously be mutagenic or carcinogenic.|$|E
25|$|Sunscreen is {{effective}} and thus recommended to prevent melanoma and squamous-cell carcinoma. There {{is little evidence}} that it {{is effective}} in preventing basal-cell carcinoma.
