5|$|The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> {{probably}} less than 250 years old, and may soon collapse. The stack is {{not mentioned in}} the Orkneyinga saga, written 1230, and on the Blaeu map of 1600, a headland exists {{at the point where the}} <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> now. The McKenzie map of Hoy of 1750 similarly shows a headland but no stack, but by 1819 the Old Man had been separated from the mainland. William Daniell sketched the sea stack at this time as a wider column with a smaller top section and an arch at the base, from which it derived its name.|$|E
5|$|Goriot, {{supportive}} of Rastignac's {{interest in his}} daughter and furious with her husband's tyrannical control over her, finds himself unable to help. When his other daughter, Anastasie, informs him {{that she has been}} selling off her husband's family jewelry to pay her lover's debts, the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> overcome with grief at his own impotence and suffers a stroke.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} the case, learning that Jason {{was taken into}} custody after the bus driver told police that he pushed Menand into the path of his vehicle. However, Jason tells authorities {{that he was trying to}} save Menand. The security guard who arrested the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> found frozen to death after exposure to a chemical refrigerant. Mulder interviews Jason, who explains Menand threatened to go public with a claim that Jason had falsified data on a research paper.|$|E

5|$|The Old Man of Hoy is a 449-foot (137m) sea stack on {{the island}} of Hoy, part of the Orkney {{archipelago}} off the north coast of Scotland. Formed from Old Red Sandstone, {{it is one of the}} tallest stacks in Britain. The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> popular with climbers, and was first climbed in 1966. Created by the erosion of a cliff through hydraulic action some time after 1750, the stack is no more than a few hundred years old, and may soon collapse into the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stop}} is District 11, {{the home of}} Katniss' {{deceased}} friend and Hunger Games ally, Rue. During the ceremony, Katniss delivers an impromptu, heartfelt speech expressing her feelings toward Rue and also Thresh, who spared her life. When she finishes, an old man whistles the tune that Rue used in the arena to tell Katniss that she was safe. Everyone else salutes Katniss, using the same gesture {{that she used to}} say farewell to Rue. To Katniss's horror, the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> quickly executed before her eyes.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{opens with}} an {{extended}} {{description of the}} Maison Vauquer, a boarding house in Paris' rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève covered with vines, owned by the widow Madame Vauquer. The residents include the law student Eugène de Rastignac, a mysterious agitator named Vautrin, and an elderly retired vermicelli-maker named Jean-Joachim Goriot. The <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> ridiculed frequently by the other boarders, who soon learn that he has bankrupted himself to support his two well-married daughters.|$|E

5|$|The old man kills Dr. Yonechi (Hiro Kanagawa), a Japanese researcher, by {{pricking}} {{him with}} a metallic stylus, introducing an unknown chemical into his body. The agents approach Nichols' girlfriend and colleague, Lisa Ianelli (Susan Lee Hoffman), who recognizes the chemical compound as a rapid freezing agent that Jason had been engineering for years. However, she claims that the compound {{has not yet been}} invented and that if Yonechi was injected with the chemical, he may not be dead. With Lisa's help, Scully and a team of medical personnel successfully resuscitate Yonechi, only for his body temperature to rapidly increase until he bursts into flames. Police receive a tip that the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> living at a nearby hotel. Inside the old man's room, the agents discover a faded color photograph picturing Jason, Yonechi and Lisa toasting champagne glasses in the cryology lab. Mulder realizes from the picture that the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> a time traveller who is attempting to alter that future, and that he is none other than Jason Nichols.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the scene}} is set, the {{characters}} are introduced: an <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> waiting for his daughter Zemfira to return home while his dinner grows cold. When she arrives, she announces that she has brought home with her a man, Aleko, who has fled the city because the law is pursuing him.|$|E

Not knowing what to make of this, the Trents, Edwards, and the police drive to the cemetery.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> {{the highest}} point in the {{historic}} county of Lancashire (administratively in Cumbria). This assertion rests upon its being higher than its near northern neighbour, Swirl How. There appears to be some doubt in the current literature over whether the height of Swirl How is 802 or 804m, following resurveying. If modern measurement has not added 2m to its rival then The Old Man of Coniston is {{the highest point}} in the Furness Fells, and the twelfth most prominent mountain in England.|$|E
25|$|Albert pleads for {{the horse}} with Emilie's grandfather, who at first remains unmoved. The <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> surprised, however, when the horse chooses {{to return to}} Albert, and he {{presents}} Albert with the military pennant, asking him what it is. Albert's quick recognition of the pennant convinces the grandfather that Joey is indeed his horse. He gives Joey back to Albert, saying that it's what Emilie would have wanted. Albert returns with Joey to his family's farm, where he returns the pennant to his father. The elder Narracott extends {{his hand to the}} boy, now a man and like him, a former soldier.|$|E

25|$|South of the Wall, Bran and {{his group}} take shelter in an {{abandoned}} mill. Nearby, Jon and the wildling party raid an elderly horse breeder's home, taking his horses and gold while the old man flees. While in the mill, Bran and Jojen Reed discuss how they plan to cross the Wall, before Meera spots the old horse breeder riding nearby. After the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> captured by the wildlings, Hodor—scared by the thunder—begins yelling, which threatens to give away their location to the wildlings. Bran uses his warg abilities to enter Hodor's mind and knocks him out.|$|E
500|$|There was {{speculation}} among {{fans that}} the murdered {{old man in}} the short could be Ben Parker, the uncle of Marvel character Spider-Man who is killed by a mugger {{as part of that}} hero's origin story. The speculation noted the way the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> killed in the short, {{and the fact that he}} is carrying Ben & Jerry's ice cream. In response to this, Leitch [...] "coyly" [...] said, [...] "That's a really interesting question", and adding, [...] "I think that people should continue to theorize who that old man was." ...|$|E
500|$|A similar {{perspective}} was {{favored by}} [...] "The Old Man's Daughter and the Old Woman's Daughter". Here, the theme echoes Cinderella, but, according to Călinescu, the rural setting provides {{a sharp contrast}} to the classical motif. Persecuted by her stepmother and stepsister, the kind and loving daughter of the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> forced into a position of servitude reflecting the plight of many peasant women in Creangă's lifetime. In this case, the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> negatively depicted as cowardly and entirely dominated by his mean wife. The focal point of the narrative is the meeting between the good daughter and Holy Sunday. The latter notices and generously rewards the girl's helpful nature and mastery of cooking; in contrast, when her envious sister attempts the same and fails, she ends up being eaten by serpent-like creatures (balauri). The happy ending sees the good girl marrying not Prince Charming, but a simple man described as [...] "kind and industrious"—this outcome, Călinescu assessed, did not in effect spare the old man's daughter from a life of intense labor. A story very similar to [...] "The Old Man's Daughter..." [...] is [...] "The Purse a' Tuppence", which teaches that greed can shatter families, while offering symbolic retribution to men who are unhappy in marriage. The old man's rooster, chased away by the old woman for being unproductive, ends up amassing a huge fortune, which he keeps inside his belly and regurgitates back into the courtyard; the jealous old woman ends up killing her favorite hen, who has failed in replicating the rooster's feat.|$|E

500|$|Richard Marshall (Ian Ogilvy) {{is a young}} Roundhead. After {{surviving}} a brief skirmish {{and killing}} his first enemy soldier (and thus saving the life of his Captain), he rides home to Brandeston, Suffolk, to visit his lover Sara (Hilary Dwyer). Sara is the niece of the village priest, John Lowes (Rupert Davies). Lowes gives his permission to Marshall to marry Sara, telling him there is trouble coming to the village and he wants Sara far away before it arrives. Marshall asks Sara why the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> frightened. She tells him they have been threatened and become outcasts in their own village. Marshall vows to Sara, [...] "rest easy and no-one shall harm you. I put my oath to that." [...] At {{the end of his}} army leave, Marshall rides back to join his regiment, and chances upon Hopkins and Stearne on the path. Marshall gives the two men directions to Brandeston then rides on.|$|E
500|$|Mike Clark of USA Today {{commented that}} he was most fascinated by the casting choices. [...] "Equally {{delightful}} is the Alison Lohman character's evolution into an older woman (Jessica Lange). It's a metamorphosis to equal any in screen history." [...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli found the fairy tale approach reminiscent of The Princess Bride (1987) and the films of Terry Gilliam. [...] "Big Fish is a clever, smart fantasy that targets the child inside every adult," [...] Berardinelli said, [...] "without insulting the intelligence of either." [...] Roger Ebert, in a mixed review, wrote [...] "there is no denying that Will has a point: The <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> a blowhard. There is {{a point at which}} his stories stop working as entertainment and segue into sadism." [...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine was disappointed, finding the father-son reconciliation storyline to be over-dramatically cliché. [...] "You recall The Boy Who Cried Wolf? Edward Bloom is the man who cried fish." [...] Big Fish was #85 on Slant Magazine's best films of the 2000s.|$|E
2500|$|Le Tricorne enchanté (1845; [...] "The Magic Hat") is a play {{set in the}} 17th century.
