5|$|Most of {{the major}} bodies of the Solar System orbit the Sun in nearly the same plane. This is likely due {{to the way in}} which the Solar System formed from a protoplanetary disk. Probably the closest current {{representation}} of the disk is known as the invariable plane of the Solar System. Earth's orbit, and hence, the ecliptic, is inclined a little more than 1° to the invariable plane, and the other major planets are also within about 6° <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Because</b> of this, most Solar System bodies appear very close to the ecliptic in the sky. The ecliptic is well defined by the motion of the Sun. The invariable plane is defined by the angular momentum of the entire Solar System, essentially the summation of all of the orbital motions and rotations of all the bodies of the system, a somewhat uncertain value that requires precise knowledge of every object in the system. For these reasons, the ecliptic is used as the reference plane of the Solar System out of convenience.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept for}} the episode {{developed}} from writer Jon Vitti {{coming up with}} a long list of bad things Bart would do for attention imagining the potential consequences. The only idea that developed into an interesting episode concept was Bart cheating on an IQ test. This idea was based on an incident from Vitti's childhood when a number of his classmates did not take an intelligence test seriously and suffered poor academic treatment because <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Because</b> Bart was already obviously unintelligent, Vitti reversed the problem for his episode. Vitti used all his memories of elementary school behavior to produce a draft script of 71 pages, substantially above the required length of about 45 pages.|$|E

25|$|Letters from Gauss {{years before}} 1829 reveal him obscurely {{discussing}} {{the problem of}} parallel lines.

25|$|Unlike some {{cars and}} motorcycles, a Wankel aero-engine will be {{sufficiently}} warm before full power is asked <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> {{of the time}} taken for pre-flight checks.

25|$|This is a {{book that}} contradicts itself a hundred times; {{but that is not}} a {{criticism}} <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> its author thinks contradictions are a sign of intellectual ferment and vitality. This {{is a book}} that systematically distorts and selects historical evidence; but that is not a criticism, because its author thinks that all interpretations are biased, and she regards it as her duty to pick and choose her facts to favor her own brand of politics. This is a book full of vaporous, French-intellectual prose that makes Teilhard de Chardin sound like Ernest Hemingway by comparison; but that is not a criticism, because the author likes that sort of prose and has taken lessons in how to write it, and she thinks that plain, homely speech is part of a conspiracy to oppress the poor.|$|E
25|$|Maj. Gen. William B. Bate's {{division}} had a {{long distance}} to march to reach its assigned objective on the Union right and when he gave the final order to attack it was almost dark. First contact with the enemy came around the Everbright Mansion, the home of Rebecca Bostick, and the Confederates pushed aside Union sharpshooters and swept past the house. However, Bate's left flank was not being protected as he expected by Chalmers's cavalry division, and they received enfilade fire. To protect the flank, Bate ordered the Florida Brigade, temporarily commanded by Col. Robert Bullock, to move from its reserve position to his left flank. This not only delayed the advance, but provided only a single line to attack the Union fortifications, leaving no reserve. Chalmers's troopers had actually engaged the Federal right by this time (the brigades of Col. Isaac M. Kirby and Brig. Gen. Walter C. Whitaker of Kimball's division), fighting dismounted, but Bate was unaware <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> the two forces were separated by rolling ground and orchards. Neither Bate nor Chalmers made any progress and they withdrew.|$|E
25|$|On Green {{beach at}} the same time that No.4 Commando had landed, the South Saskatchewan Regiment's 1st Battalion was headed towards Pourville. They beached at 04:52 without having been detected. The {{battalion}} managed to leave their landing craft before the Germans could open fire. However, on the way in, some of the landing craft had drifted off course and most of the battalion found themselves west of the River Scie rather than east <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Because</b> they had been landed in the wrong place, the battalion, whose objective was the hills east of the village, had to enter Pourville to cross the river by the only bridge. Before the Saskatchewans managed to reach the bridge, the Germans had positioned machine guns and anti-tank guns there which stopped their advance. With the battalion's dead and wounded piling up on the bridge, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Cecil Ingersoll Merritt, the commanding officer, attempted to give the attack impetus by repeatedly and openly crossing the bridge, in order to demonstrate that it was feasible to do so. However, despite the assault resuming, the South Saskatchewans and the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada, who had landed beside them, were unable to reach their target. While the Camerons did manage to penetrate further inland than any other troops that day, they were also soon forced back as German reinforcements rushed to the scene. Both battalions suffered more losses as they withdrew; only 341 men were able to reach the landing craft and embark, and the rest were left to surrender. For his part in the battle, Lieutenant Colonel Merritt was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E

So they came up with the bizarre idea of putting his presence into Anna Torv, which is outrageous. Outrageous, and yet we did it, and {{had a lot of fun}} doing it.

500|$|Criticism of {{the game}} stemmed from its short length.

[...] Even though GamesRadar liked the game's quality, they said that Nintendo should have [...] " [...] the experience last longer." [...] GameSpot was disappointed with the [...] "short-lived experience", but blamed the game's captivating quality that compelled them to complete the game in a few sittings. Calling Metroid: Zero Mission stale, GameSpy asserted that players less familiar with Metroid games would get more enjoyment out <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of its similarities to previous Metroid games.|$|E

500|$|Even the novel's {{language}} bridges this divide.

She also uses the term specifically to highlight what is unusual {{as it applies to}} gender, or Nan's own emotions toward Kitty. Nan's father uses the symbol of the oyster, what he calls a [...] "real queer fish" [...] that exhibits both male and female characteristics, and compares it to Kitty who sits before them in feminine attire though they have seen her on stage dressed as a man. The landlady of the boarding house where Kitty and Nan are staying appraises Nan's first male costume, and is troubled by the [...] "queerness" [...] <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> she looks too much like a man, instead of a woman pretending to be a man.

500|$|The band Motörhead {{was founded}} in 1975 by already {{experienced}} musicians. Their leader Ian [...] "Lemmy" [...] Kilmister was {{a former member of}} the space rock band Hawkwind, Larry Wallis had played with Pink Fairies, and Eddie Clarke had been a member of Curtis Knight's Zeus. Their previous experience is one element which divides critics and fans over whether the band belongs to the new wave of British heavy metal. Some believe that the band should be considered an inspiration for the movement, but not part <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> they had signed recording contracts, toured the country, and had chart success before any NWOBHM band had stepped out of their local club scene. Motörhead were also the only metal band of the period recording songs with veteran BBC radio DJ John Peel for his Peel Sessions program and the first to reach No.1 in the UK Albums Chart with the live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith in June 1981. Lemmy himself said, [...] "the NWOBHM... didn't do us much good", because Motörhead [...] "came along a bit too early for it".|$|E

[...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Chris Willman complimented the video for its portrayal of a love song, rather than blasphemy. He was more interested in the stigmata presented in the clip.
