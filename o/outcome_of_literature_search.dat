40|$|Lynch {{syndrome}} (LS) is characterised by {{the development}} of colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer and various other cancers, and is caused by a mutation in one of the mismatch repair genes: MLH 1, MSH 2, MSH 6 or PMS 2. In 2007, a group of European experts (the Mallorca group) published guidelines for the clinical management of LS. Since then substantial new information has become available necessitating an update of the guidelines. In 2011 and 2012 workshops were organised in Palma de Mallorca. A total of 35 specialists from 13 countries participated in the meetings. The first step was to formulate important clinical questions. Then a systematic <b>literature</b> <b>search</b> was performed using the Pubmed database and manual searches of relevant articles. During the workshops the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> the <b>literature</b> <b>search</b> was discussed in detail. The guidelines described in this paper may be helpful for the appropriate management of families with LS. Prospective controlled studies should be undertaken to improve further the care of these families. ...|$|R

40|$|Animal {{studies have}} {{evidenced}} {{protection of the}} auditory nerve by exogenous neurotrophic factors. In order to assess clinical applicability of neurotrophic treatment of the auditory nerve, the safety and efficacy of neurotrophic therapies in various human disorders were systematically reviewed. <b>Outcomes</b> <b>of</b> our <b>literature</b> <b>search</b> included disorder, neurotrophic factor, administration route, therapeutic outcome, and adverse event. From 2103 articles retrieved, 20 randomized controlled trials including 3974 patients were selected. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (53 %) was the most frequently reported indication for neurotrophic therapy followed by diabetic polyneuropathy (28 %). Ciliary neurotrophic factor (50 %), nerve growth factor (24 %) and insulin-like growth factor (21 %) were most often used. Injection site reaction was a frequently occurring adverse event (61 %) followed by asthenia (24 %) and gastrointestinal disturbances (20 %). Eighteen out of 20 trials deemed neurotrophic therapy to be safe, and six out of 17 studies concluded the neurotrophic therapy to be effective. Positive outcomes were generally small or contradicted by other studies. Most non-neurodegenerative diseases treated by targeted deliveries of neurotrophic factors were considered safe and effective. Hence, since local delivery to the cochlea is feasible, translation from animal studies to human trials in treating auditory nerve degeneration seems promising...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Research on {{childhood}} witnessing of interparental {{violence is}} reviewed. Evidence {{is presented as}} to the severe developmental damages the witnessing covictims often sustain. These include: depression, anxiety, cognitive problems, delinquency, and proneness to violence and victimization. Parental failure to shield children from such traumatizing experiences constitutes child maltreatment in that it exposes the victims to (a) terrorizing, and (b) missocializing by corrupting models. Psychological maltreatment is even more potentially damaging than direct physical abuse or neglect alone. In light of the ambiguity in de®ning caregiver acts of psychological maltreatment, cases in which children have regularly watched wife battering are easier to identify than other forms of psychological maltreatment. Child protection agencies must give priority to responding to cases of psycho-logical maltreatment of children. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. KEY WORDS. Psychological maltreatment, spouse abuse, witnessing violence, child abuse, battered women LAST YEAR I (ES) was consulted by Israel's National Council for the Child (INCC) {{in a criminal case}} handled by the Tel Aviv District Attorney's of®ce. The defendant was a 28 -year-old male who lived separately from his estranged wife and their 4 -year-old son. He was tried for aggravated assault, rape, and sodomy.

40|$|Classroom {{management}} {{is a critical}} skill area. Teachers should be trained and supported in implementing practices {{that are likely to}} be successful; that is, practices that are backed by evidence. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> a systematic <b>literature</b> <b>search</b> conducted to identify evidence-based classroom management practices. Although the need for additional research exists, 20 practices, in general, were identified as having sufficient evidence to be considered for classroom adoption. Considerations for incorporating these pracfices are suggested, and a self-assessment tool is proposed as means of evaluating and enhancing use of these practices. Suggesfions for future research are also presented. Classroom {{management is}} an important element of pre-serviceteacher training and in-service teacher behavior (Emmer & Stough, 2001) and is comprised of three central components: maximized allocation of time for instruction, arrangement of instructional activities to maximize academic engagement and achievement, and proactive behavior management practices (Sugai & Horner, 2002). Early research on classroom management employed either descriptive or correlational methods and highlighted practices that were used by "effective teachers " (e. g., Kounin & Obradovik, 1967; Kounin, Friesen...|$|R

Concerning themes addressed by health promotion projects most countries belonging to the Mediterranean or 'Western European' macro-regions have concentrated on similar themes whereas this is not valid for the countries of the 'Former Eastern European' macro-region. The hypothesis on macro-regional similarities in relation to settings of health promotion projects was not confirmed.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To explain {{differences}} in the results <b>of</b> <b>literature</b> <b>searches</b> in British general practice and North American family practice or family medicine. DESIGN: Comparative <b>literature</b> <b>search.</b> SETTING: The Department of Family and Community Medicine at the University of Toronto in Ontario. METHOD: <b>Literature</b> <b>searches</b> on MEDLINE demonstrated that certain search strategies ignored certain key words, depending on the search engine and the <b>search</b> terms chosen. <b>Literature</b> <b>searches</b> using the key words "general practice," "family practice," and "family medicine" combined with the topics "depression" and then "otitis media" were conducted in MEDLINE using four different Web-based search engines: Ovid, HealthGate, PubMed, and Internet Grateful Med. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of MEDLINE references retrieved for both topics when searched {{with each of the}} three key words, "general practice," "family practice," and "family medicine" using each of the four search engines. RESULTS: For each topic, each search yielded very different articles. Some search engines did a better job of matching the term "general practice" to the terms "family medicine" and "family practice," and thus improved retrieval. The problem of language use extends to the variable use of terminology and {{differences in}} spelling between British and American English. CONCLUSION: We need to heighten awareness <b>of</b> <b>literature</b> <b>search</b> problems and the potential for duplication of research effort when some <b>of</b> the <b>literature</b> is ignored, and to suggest ways to overcome the deficiencies of the various search engines...|$|R
