40|$|Visualisation {{methods for}} {{exploring}} microarray data {{are particularly important}} for gaining insight into data from gene expression experiments, such as those concerned {{with the development of}} an understanding of gene function and interactions. Further, good visualisation techniques are useful for outlier detection in microarray data and for aiding biological interpretation of results, as well as for presentation of <b>overall</b> <b>summaries</b> of the data. The biplot is particularly useful for the display of microarray data as both the genes and the chips can be simultaneously plotted. In this paper we describe several ordination techniques suitable for exploring microarray data, and we call these the GE-biplot, the Chip-plot and the Gene-plot. The general method is first evaluated on synthetic data simulated in accord with current biological interpretation of microarray data. Then it is applied to two well-known data sets, namely the colon data of Alon et al. (1999) and the leukaemia data of Golub et al. (1999). The usefulness of the approach for interpreting and comparing different analyses of the same data is demonstrated. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper reviews {{a number}} of studies that have sought to {{estimate}} the economic costs of criminal offending and, more specifically, violent crime. Firstly, it discusses those approaches that have sought to describe the ‘big picture’ by calculating the aggregate burden of all crime. These studies yield useful <b>overall</b> <b>summaries</b> about the magnitude of the crime problem but also reveal how {{little is known about the}} value of the ‘intangible’ effects of violent crime (e. g. the anxiety suffered by potential victims or the pain and suffering imposed on actual victims). Secondly, the authors review the growing number of contributions that have begun the process of filling this gap through novel applications of nonmarket valuation methods in a crime context. In particular, the findings of a recent attempt to estimate the costs of categories of violent crime (of varying levels of severity) in the United Kingdom using the contingent valuation method are discussed. Whilst valuing the intangible costs of violent crime is a challenging task, a more explicit assessment is needed not just to improve the transparency of public decision-making but also to ensure that policy benefits of crime prevention can be compared directly with the costs of implementation. ...|$|R

40|$|Opinion {{analysis}} {{is concerned with}} extracting information about attitudes, beliefs, emotions, opinions, evaluations and sentiment expressed in texts. To date, {{research in the area}} of opinion analysis has focused on developing methods for the automatic extraction of opinions and their attributes. While this opinion information is useful, its true potential can be realized only after it is consolidated (summarized) in a meaningful way: the raw information contained in individual opinions is often incomplete and their number is overwhelming. Until now, the task of domain-independent opinion summarization has received little research attention. We address this void by proposing methods for opinion summarization. Toward that end, we formulate new approaches for the problems of determining what opinions should be attributed to the same source (source coreference resolution) and whether opinions are on the same topic (topic identification/coreference resolution). Additionally, we introduce novel evaluation metrics for the quantitative evaluation of the quality of complete opinion summaries. Finally, we describe and evaluate OASIS, the first opinion summarization system known to us that produces domain-independent non-extract based summaries. Results for the individual components are encouraging and the <b>overall</b> <b>summaries</b> produced by OASIS outperform a competitive baseline by a large margin when we put more emphasis on computing an aggregate summary during evaluation...|$|R

Clearly, genetic drift has increased the overall level of homozygosis by the amount (0.6411 − 0.5342) = 0.1069. In a complementary approach, the heterozygosity could be used instead. The panmictic equivalent for Aa is 2 p• q• = 0.4658, which is higher than that in the sampled bulk (0.3588) [...] "8". The sampling has caused the heterozygosity to decrease by 0.1070, which differs trivially from the earlier estimate because of rounding errors.|$|E
