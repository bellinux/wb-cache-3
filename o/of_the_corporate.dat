5|$|A {{second tranche}} of development, {{undertaken}} in two stages, was approved in November 2009. This included a general refurbishment and {{improvement of the}} existing facilities at the stadium, adding cover, better toilet and new refreshment facilities to the exposed East Stand, improving wheelchair access, adding extra catering and conferencing facilities and a new media and management centre. This was funded by collaboration between Gateshead Council, local development funds and Gateshead College. The covering of the 4,000-seat East Stand with a new canopy roof was completed in July 2010, immediately prior to Gateshead hosting a Diamond League event. The second stage of the re-development—the building <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> and media facilities—commenced on 6 September 2010 and was completed on time in summer2011. The {{total cost of the}} work was estimated to be £7.6million.|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores <b>the</b> {{importance}} <b>of</b> managing <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> identity. To {{reach this}} purpose, three research questions were posed: Which advantages companies saw with managing <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> identity, which risks they saw {{with a lack}} <b>of</b> managing <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> identity, {{and what do they}} consider when managing <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> identity. To answer these research questions, a case study methodology using in-depth interviews was followed focusing on two multinational companies, IKEA and Electrolux. The findings show that companies are very aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> managing <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> identity as well as which benefits this can result in.

5|$|As {{part of the}} restructuring, 3G {{also moved}} to change many aspects of {{corporate}} operations throughout 2011-2012. One of the first moves was to terminate Burger King's relationship with ad agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky, replacing it with McGarryBowen. 3G also began a menu restructuring, with the first product being a revamped version of BK's Chicken Tenders product. Other new or reformulated products would follow. In terms of its franchise operations, Burger King initiated a move to become more like competitors Subway and KFC and began to sell off the majority of corporately owned restaurants {{in order to become}} an exclusive franchised operation. 3G also moved to mend relations with its American franchises, which had become rather rancorous during TPG's tenure. Several lawsuits were settled and corporate policies that were at the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> disputes with the franchises were ended or amended.|$|E
5|$|Market {{and brand}} focused {{organizations}} {{are concerned with}} the expression and perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> brand. Corporate design management implements, develops, and maintains the corporate identity, or brand. This type of brand management is strongly anchored in the organization to control and influence corporate design activities. The design program plays the role of a quality program within many fields of the organization to achieve uniform internal branding. It is strongly linked to strategy, corporate culture, product development, marketing, organizational structure, and technological development. Achieving a consistent corporate brand requires the involvement of designers and a widespread design awareness among employees. A creative culture, knowledge sharing processes, determination, design leadership, and good work relations support the work of corporate brand management.|$|E

5|$|In January 1937, {{ownership}} of WAAB was consolidated {{with that of}} another Boston station controlled by Shepard: WNAC was flagship of the Yankee Network, a circuit of New England radio stations whose membership partially overlapped with that of Colonial. Yankee flagship WNAC had been an affiliate of CBS Radio, changing affiliation to NBC Red later in 1937 when CBS purchased WEEI in that city. The Texas Network soon added twenty-three more stations to the Mutual affiliate roster. WGAR dropped out, but the United Broadcasting Company, part of The Plain Dealer business, joined with its lead station, WHK. Within a few years, this new Ohio participant {{would become one of}} the network's central members, a shareowner in Mutual. By the end of 1938, Mutual had 74 exclusive affiliates; though the two leading radio network companies discouraged dual hookups, Mutual shared another 25 affiliates with NBC and 5 with CBS. The total of 104 affiliates put Mutual not far behind the leaders. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> strength behind NBC and CBS, however, {{and the fact that the}} lion's share of the most powerful stations in the country had already signed with them before Mutual's emergence (the exceptional, and soon departed, WLW aside), the cooperative network would be at a permanent disadvantage.|$|E
5|$|When The Jackyl {{left the}} WWF, the duo joined The Undertaker's new heel stable, the Ministry of Darkness. They debuted in Undertaker's Ministry on the January 11, 1999 edition of Raw, where they {{recruited}} Dennis Knight into the Ministry, {{giving him the}} name Mideon. After Undertaker's Ministry merged with The Corporation to form the Corporate Ministry, the Acolytes began a feud with X-Pac and Kane over the WWF World Tag Team Championship. The feud began on the May 30, 1999 edition of Sunday Night Heat, where the Acolytes attacked X-Pac after his match against The Big Boss Man. Their attack was to no avail, however, as Kane, X-Pac's tag team partner, {{came down to the}} ring to attack the Acolytes. Later that night, the Acolytes challenged X-Pac and Kane for a WWF Tag Team Championship match on the following Raw broadcast. The following night on Raw, X-Pac and Kane accepted the challenge. During the match, however, Shane McMahon, who was also a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corporate</b> Ministry, interfered in the match, causing Kane to chase McMahon to the backstage area. The situation allowed Bradshaw to hit X-Pac with a Clothesline from Hell into a pinfall, allowing the Acolytes to win their first WWF Tag Team Championship.|$|E
