50|$|Every cargo in ship is {{controlled}} before being unloaded. The controls are strict for {{the chemical and}} <b>oil</b> <b>carriers</b> and are conducted by an independent surveyor. The ullage is a mean to calculate the quantity into the tanks; the sample gives {{an idea of the}} quality (density and temperature) of the water in tanks. The surveyor must have the three last cargos to know the problems of compatibility (IMDG code) Older is the vessel, more the controls are made frequently (especially for the <b>oil</b> <b>carriers</b> to avoid the Erika disaster as an example). For the dry bulk cargo, it is compulsory to apply a product a gas rats to avoid problems with this animal.|$|R

25|$|Where the {{refinery}} of oil {{had taken place}} near the well earlier, this moved to the consumer location during this stage. Oil production in the Middle East developed and the dominance of product tankers was replaced by crude <b>oil</b> <b>carriers.</b> Soon, Panamax tankers were built, soon followed by Aframax and Suezmax tankers because of economics.|$|R

50|$|Natural beard oils are {{typically}} created with both <b>carrier</b> <b>oils</b> and essential oils, absolutes, and/or extracts. <b>Carrier</b> <b>oils</b> are oils {{that make up}} the bulk of the volume of the product and are formulated to condition the skin and beard. The most popular types of <b>carrier</b> <b>oils</b> are coconut, grape seed, jojoba, saffron and argan. They are used as a natural fragrance for the beard oils, but also may have aromatherapy benefits. Since essential oils, absolutes, and extracts are usually very strong they may cause chemical burns or skin irritation, they are commonly paired up with <b>carrier</b> <b>oils</b> in order to dilute them.|$|R
50|$|Around 1898 {{the company}} became {{responsible}} for the ships of Shell Transport and Trading In 1907 Continued to be {{responsible for the}} trade in oil by-products when the Dutch Petroleum Company was established to take over the petroleum business of the Dutch state authorities and the Shell company. The same year it was incorporated into Royal Dutch Shell. In 1908 Shell Transport and Trading had placed all of its assets in Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co and Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij which also held all of the assets of Royal Dutch Shell Since then the company owned and ran the oil transport and storage activities of the Shell group of companies. During the following two decades Anglo-Saxon became the most progressive, innovative and forward-looking of all the <b>oil</b> <b>carriers.</b> In order to match transport demand, they commissioned new buildings based on their own design or, indeed, bought and re-designed existing ships with an amazing degree of innovative thinking and fantasy. Liner ships, general cargo vessels, sailing ships and even train ferries were re-built and made into <b>oil</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Carrier</b> <b>oil,</b> {{also known}} as base oil or {{vegetable}} oil, is used to dilute essential oils and absolutes before they are applied to the skin in massage and aromatherapy. They are so named because they carry the essential oil onto the skin. <b>Carrier</b> <b>oils</b> do not contain a concentrated aroma, unlike essential oils, though some, such as olive, have a mild distinctive smell. Neither do they evaporate like essential oils, which are more volatile. The <b>carrier</b> <b>oils</b> used should be as natural and unadulterated as possible. Many people feel organic oils are of higher quality. Cold-pressing and maceration are the two main methods of producing <b>carrier</b> <b>oils.</b>|$|R

2500|$|... 1978 saw {{the start}} of a severe {{downturn}} in the shipping business. Pao and his managers were quick to spot the problem and commenced a programme to reduce the fleet, especially crude <b>oil</b> <b>carriers,</b> selling ships as they came off charter. 140 ships were sold and the fleet reduced by half over a period of 4 to 5 years allowing debt to be paid off and cash resources built up. Although this was a difficult time for World-Wide, the company, through early action and conservative financial management, was able to ride the recession with little of the problems seen elsewhere in the industry.|$|R

50|$|Wet system {{particle}} {{range in}} size from less than 0.5 micrometres to 10 micrometres for use with water or <b>oil</b> <b>carriers.</b> Particles used in wet systems have pigments applied that fluoresce at 365 nm (ultraviolet A) requiring 1000 µW/cm2 (10 W/m2) at the surface of the part for proper inspection. If the particles do not have the correct light applied in a darkroom the particles cannot be detected/seen. It is industry practice to use UV goggles/glasses to filter the UV light and amplify the visible light spectrum (normally green and yellow) created by the fluorescing particles. Green and yellow fluorescence was chosen, because the human eye reacts best to these colors.|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} British {{industrial}} decline since 1945 {{has focused on}} whether the decline was relative or an absolute process. As a British industry, shipbuilding illustrates many contradictions inherent in both views; although overtaken by Japanese competition from the mid 1950 ’s, between 1945 - 1973 the output and productivity of British shipbuilding increased faster than at any point previously. This paper will discuss {{the role of the}} state in this process by using the negotiations between government and the Scott Lithgow shipyard in Scotland concerning the market for 250, 000 -ton crude <b>oil</b> <b>carriers</b> as an example, demonstrating that the agency of both management and government influenced the eventual outcome more than prevailing market conditions of the time...|$|R
