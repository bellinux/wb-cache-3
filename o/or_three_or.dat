According to him, Gaga was tired from playing bigger venues, and wanted to have the tour visit smaller venues for at least three-four days, or for three-six weeks. Bennett also {{explained that he was}} accustomed to playing in acoustic music halls and outdoor theaters, so Gaga had been looking at such options. [...] "I'm not interested in playing to 45,000 people a night, so [...] finding places where we could work for three or four days, <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four weeks, in one place at a time.

On New Year's Eve 2014, the duo started the Cheek to Cheek Tour by performing at the Cosmopolitan Casino of Las Vegas, making it their first concert in US following the album's release. They also performed at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards and its scheduled a post-Grammy concert on February 8, 2015, at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, just after the conclusion of the ceremony. More shows were scheduled in 2015, including Hollywood Bowl on May 30; the Royal Albert Hall in London on June 8; and Radio City Music Hall in New York City on June 19. Jesse Lawrence from Forbes reported that there was high demand for the tickets, leading to additional dates being added to the itinerary.

2500|$|Proof. The {{identity}} is an isometry; nothing changes, so distance cannot change. And if one isometry cannot change distance, neither can two (<b>or</b> <b>three,</b> <b>or</b> more) in succession; thus {{the composition of}} two isometries is again an isometry, and the set of isometries is closed under composition. The {{identity is}}ometry is also an identity for composition, and composition is associative; therefore isometries satisfy the axioms for a semigroup. For a group, we must also have an inverse for every element. To cancel a reflection, we merely compose it with itself. (Reflections are involutions.) And since every isometry can be expressed as a sequence of reflections, its inverse can be expressed as that sequence reversed. Notice that the cancellation {{of a pair of}} identical reflections reduces the number of reflections by an even number, preserving the parity of the sequence; also notice that the identity has even parity. Therefore all isometries form a group, and even isometries a subgroup. (Odd isometries do not include the identity, so are not a subgroup.) This subgroup is a normal subgroup, because sandwiching an even isometry between two odd ones yields an even isometry. ∎ ...|$|E

OSHA also requires employers to report on every injury or job-related illness requiring medical treatment (other than first aid) on OSHA Form 300, [...] "Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses" [...] (known as an [...] "OSHA Log" [...] or [...] "Form 300").

A day after the report, Blue Jays first baseman Lyle Overbay was quoted as being one of the players who was surprised over his lack of playing time as well as wanting Gaston to improve his communication. [...] "More than anything, I want to try to figure out what to expect for next year. It kind of caught me off-guard a little bit when I wasn't playing. ... (Gaston) never really said a lot.
