40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the association between}} Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) and the UPPS-P impulsivity facets in eating disorder patients and healthy controls. The prevalence of NSSI in eating disorder (ED) patients ranged from 17 % in restrictive an- <b>orexia</b> <b>nervosa</b> (AN-R) patients to 43 % in patients with bulimia nervosa (BN). In healthy con- trols (HC), the prevalence of NSSI was 19 %. Eating disorder patients from the binge eating/ purging type showed significantly more NSSI compared to restrictive ED and HC partici- pants. Binge-eating/purging ED patients also {{scored significantly higher on}} Negative/Posi- tive Urgency, Lack of Premeditation and Lack of Perseverance compared to HC and restrictive ED patients. Comparable findings were found between ED patients and HC with and without NSSI; ED patients and HC with NSSI scored significantly higher in four of the five UPPS-P dimensions compared to participants without NSSI; Sensation Seeking was the exception. Finally, the presence of NSSI in HC/ED patients was particularly predicted by low levels of Perseverance. Therefore, the treatment of ED patients with NSSI certainly needs to focus on the training of effortful control...|$|E
