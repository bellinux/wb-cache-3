5|$|Mesoscale {{discussions are}} issued to provide {{information}} <b>on</b> <b>certain</b> individual regions where severe weather is becoming a threat and states whether a watch is likely and details thereof, particularly concerning conditions conducive {{for the development of}} severe thunderstorms in the short term, as well as situations of isolated severe weather when watches are not necessary. Watches are issued when forecasters are confident that severe weather will occur, and usually precede the onset of severe weather by one hour, although this sometimes varies depending <b>on</b> <b>certain</b> atmospheric conditions that may inhibit or accelerate convective development.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of cardinal is a rank of honour bestowed by popes <b>on</b> <b>certain</b> clergy, such as leaders within the Roman Curia, bishops serving {{in major cities}} and distinguished theologians.

5|$|Although toads {{are usually}} solitary animals, in the {{breeding}} season, {{large numbers of}} toads converge <b>on</b> <b>certain</b> breeding ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings {{in the water and}} later hatch out into tadpoles. After several months of growth and development, these sprout limbs and undergo metamorphosis into tiny toads. The juveniles emerge from the water and remain largely terrestrial {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
5|$|Armigers, like clan {{chiefs and}} chieftains, may wear their own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their own motto or slogan. Armigers are permitted to wear one silver eagle feather behind the circlet (or <b>on</b> <b>certain</b> occasions a real eagle feather). If an Armiger {{is a member of}} the British Peerage or a feudal baron they are permitted to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge. If an Armiger is a member of a Scottish clan he or she may wear the crest badge of their chief, however it must be encircled by a strap and buckle (see Un-armigerous clan members below).|$|E
5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual camera system creators {{have to deal}} with a world that is {{interactive}} and unpredictable. It is not possible to know where the player's character {{is going to be in}} the next few seconds; therefore, it is not possible to plan the shots as a film maker would do. To solve this issue, the system relies <b>on</b> <b>certain</b> rules or artificial intelligence to select the most appropriate shots.|$|E

On the Donegal islands of Arranmore, Gola, Inishfree, Inisbofin and Tory, voting took place on 24 October between 11:00 and 15:00 (11:00 and 19:30 on Arranmore). On 25 October, the Mayo islands of Clare Island, Inishbiggle and Inishturk went to the polls; while the Galway islands of Inishbofin and the Aran Islands voted on 26 October between 07:00 and 22:00.|$|E
5|$|Fresh {{fruit and}} vegetables, {{as well as}} fish and meat, can be {{purchased}} either from supermarkets or specialty shops. Street markets are held <b>on</b> <b>certain</b> days in most localities; some towns have a more permanent covered market enclosing food shops, especially meat and fish retailers. These have better shelter than the periodic street markets.|$|E
5|$|From 1993 to 1996, Apple {{developed}} a marketing strategy that promised free and unlimited live-telephone support <b>on</b> <b>certain</b> products {{for as long}} as the original purchaser owned those products; by 1997, however, changes in Apple's AppleCare support policy led Apple to rescind the offer, resulting in a consumer class action lawsuit for breach of contract. Apple denied wrongdoing but, in settlement of the claims, Apple ultimately reinstated the telephone support for the duration of original ownership of the otherwise obsolete products and customers affected by the change were given a limited reimbursement if they had been refused telephone support, had been charged per incident, or had incurred third party support charges.|$|E

5|$|German {{politicians}} of the then government parties (Social Democrats and Liberals) {{as well as}} the opposition (the conservative Union parties) generally acclaimed the non-violent outcome of the hijacking. This reflected the public opinion that with the Munich attackers having left the country, the risk of further terrorist acts against German targets had diminished. Criticism evolved around the lack of sufficient airport security to prevent explosives being smuggled into passenger airliners, and Lufthansa not employing sky marshals, which at that time were already common <b>on</b> <b>certain</b> flights by El Al, Pan Am, Swissair, and others.|$|E
5|$|Governments {{such as the}} Netherlands and New Zealand {{have responded}} to the public's {{concerns}} by outlawing invasive experiments <b>on</b> <b>certain</b> classes of non-human primates, particularly the great apes. In 2015, captive chimpanzees in the U.S. were added to the Endangered Species Act adding new road blocks to those wishing to experiment on them. Similarly, citing ethical considerations and the availability of alternative research methods, the U.S. NIH announced in 2013 that it would dramatically reduce and eventually phase out experiments on chimpanzees.|$|E
5|$|Horseback {{riding and}} {{mountain}} biking are popular but are only allowed <b>on</b> <b>certain</b> trails. Kayaking is popular along the seacoast {{and in the}} various rivers and streams. Kayakers and canoeists frequently travel the Smith River, which is the longest undammed river remaining in California. Fishing for salmon and steelhead, a highly prized anadromous form of rainbow trout over , is best in the Smith and Klamath rivers. A California sport fishing license is required to fish any of the rivers and streams. Hunting is not permitted anywhere in the parks, but is allowed in nearby National Forests.|$|E

5|$|In 1817, the Netherlands reintroduced {{the metric}} system, but used pre-revolutionary namesâ€”for example 1centimetre became the duim (thumb), the ons (ounce) became 100g and so <b>on.</b> <b>Certain</b> German states adopted similar systems and in 1852 the German Zollverein (customs union) adopted the zollpfund (customs pound) of 500g for intrastate commerce. In 1872 {{the newly formed}} German Empire adopted the metric system as its {{official}} system of weights and measures and the newly formed Kingdom of Italy likewise, following the lead given by Piedmont, adopted the metric system in 1861.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of the established and popular activity of mountain biking in the greater Adelaide area, and to better accommodate the mountain biking community in the north eastern suburbs, it was proposed in 2006 to permit cycling in designated zones on purpose-built tracks and <b>on</b> <b>certain</b> management tracks within the park. The intention is to satisfy both biodiversity and recreation objectives {{in the park and}} reducing the incidence of illegal mountain bike riding in other non designated areas.|$|E

As a result, 100 of the 411 elements of the Constitution were changed, with both sides compromising <b>on</b> <b>certain</b> issues. Nevertheless, the governors of the eastern provinces rejected the changes, believing it gave them insufficient autonomy, while various Indianist and leftist members of MAS felt that the amendments conceded too much to the political right. The constitution was put to a referendum in January 2009, {{in which it was}} approved by 61.4% of voters.|$|E
5|$|Killer {{whales are}} apex predators, {{meaning that they}} {{themselves}} have no natural predators. They are sometimes called the wolves of the sea, because they hunt in groups like wolf packs. Killer whales hunt varied prey including fish, cephalopods, mammals, sea birds and sea turtles. However, different populations or ecotypes may specialize and some can have a dramatic impact <b>on</b> <b>certain</b> prey species. Specialization of prey species may be more common in whales that inhabit temperate areas due to higher food productivity.|$|E
