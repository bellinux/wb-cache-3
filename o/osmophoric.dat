An equation obtained by classic MLR procedure resulted for δ (the {{presence of the}} <b>osmophoric</b> group in the extreme axial position of the decaline rest) and D (the distance between the <b>osmophoric</b> group and the hydrophobic moiety of the molecule) as structural parameters, give a good correlation coefficient (r = 0. 934); another equation using δ, D and MTD as structural parameters show a very good correlation coefficient (r = 0. 984). A hypothetical model for the sandalwood odour receptor site with Dopt = 3. 5 Å is proposed...|$|E
