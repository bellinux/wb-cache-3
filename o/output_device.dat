5|$|Of the 20 bits {{allocated}} for each program instruction, 10 {{were used to}} hold the instruction code, which allowed for 1,024 (210) different instructions. The machine had 26 initially, increasing to 30 when the function codes to programmatically control the data transfer between the magnetic drum and the cathode ray tube (CRT) main store were added. On the Intermediary Version programs were input by key switches, and the output was displayed {{as a series of}} dots and dashes on a cathode ray tube known as the <b>output</b> <b>device,</b> just as on the SSEM from which the Mark 1 had been developed. However, the Final Specification machine, completed in October 1949, benefitted from the addition of a teleprinter with a 5-hole paper-tape reader and punch.|$|E

25|$|Typically, when an {{algorithm}} {{is associated with}} processing information, data can be read from an input source, written to an <b>output</b> <b>device</b> and stored for further processing. Stored data are regarded {{as part of the}} internal state of the entity performing the algorithm. In practice, the state is stored in one or more data structures.|$|E
25|$|The {{keyboard}} on the teleprinter {{played a}} strong role in point-to-point and point-to-multipoint communication {{for most of}} the 20th century, while the keyboard on the keypunch device played a strong role in data entry and storage for just as long. The development of the earliest computers incorporated electric typewriter keyboards: the development of the ENIAC computer incorporated a keypunch device as both the input and paper-based <b>output</b> <b>device,</b> while the BINAC computer also made use of an electromechanically controlled typewriter for both data entry onto magnetic tape (instead of paper) and data output.|$|E

50|$|In analog {{push-pull}} {{power amplifiers}} the two <b>output</b> <b>devices</b> operate in antiphase (i.e. 180° apart). The two antiphase outputs {{are connected to}} the load in a way that causes the signal outputs to be added, but distortion components due to non-linearity in the <b>output</b> <b>devices</b> to be subtracted from each other; if the non-linearity of both <b>output</b> <b>devices</b> is similar, distortion is much reduced. Symmetrical push-pull circuits must cancel even order harmonics, like f2, f4, f6 and therefore promote odd order harmonics, like (f1), f3, f5 when driven into the nonlinear range.|$|R

500|$|By June 1948 the SSEM {{had been}} built and was working. It was [...] in length, [...] tall, and weighed almost [...] The machine {{contained}} 550valves—300diodes and 250pentodes—and had a power consumption of 3500watts. The arithmetic unit was built using EF50 pentode valves, which had been widely used during wartime. The SSEM used one Williams tube to provide 32 by 32-bit words of random-access memory (RAM), a second to hold a 32-bit accumulator in which the intermediate results of a calculation could be stored temporarily, and a third to hold the current program instruction along with its address in memory.

50|$|Impedance {{variations}} of the load with frequency translate into variation in the phase relationship between the amplifier's voltage and current outputs. For a resistive load, usually (but not always) the voltage across the amplifier's <b>output</b> <b>devices</b> is maximum when the load current is minimum (and the voltage is minimum across the load) and vice versa, {{and as a result}} the power dissipation in those devices is least. But due to the complex and variable nature of the driver/crossover load and its effect on the phase relationship between the voltage and current, the current will not necessarily be at its minimum when the voltage across the <b>output</b> <b>devices</b> is maximum - this results in increased power dissipation in the amplifier output stage which manifests as heating in the <b>output</b> <b>devices.</b> The phase angle varies most near resonance in moving coil loudspeakers. If this point is not taken into consideration during the amplifier design, the amplifier may overheat causing it to shut down, or cause failure of the <b>output</b> <b>devices.</b> See Power factor for more detail.|$|R
