40|$|Background and ObjectivesDiabetic {{patients}} {{play the}} main {{role in the}} management of their disease. Adequate knowledge of this disease state and self directed <b>patient</b> <b>care</b> will improve the health <b>of</b> these <b>patients.</b> Some studies have indicated a high prevalence of diabetes complication are {{due to the lack of}} knowledge <b>of</b> self directed <b>patient</b> <b>care</b> and practice in diabetic patient group. The objective of this study is to measure the knowledge level <b>of</b> self directed <b>patient</b> <b>care</b> and practice in order to evaluate their effects on improvement of diabetic patients' health in the city of Qom, Iran. MethodsIn this cross sectional study 1004 patients with diabetes participated (During year 2006). Data were collected from <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> General Hospital metabolism and endocrine research center. An interviewing method was used to asses the demographics data, history of disease, and knowledge <b>of</b> self directed <b>patient</b> <b>care</b> in these <b>patients.</b> Data were analyzed using a descriptive statistic, chi-square, and Pearson correlation coefficient, and SPSS software. ResultsOut of 1004 observed case, 154 patients were with Diabetes type I and 850 patients with Diabetes type II. The knowledge <b>of</b> self directed <b>patient</b> <b>care</b> and practice level of with both types of diabetes were determined to be mostly at an intermediate level. In type I diabetic patients there was a significant relation between knowledge level <b>of</b> self directed <b>patient</b> <b>care</b> and gender <b>of</b> the <b>patients</b> (P= 0. 01). Also, there was a significant correlation between practice and age (P= 0. 03 (, and economical status (P= 0. 06) <b>of</b> the <b>patients.</b> In type II diabetic patients there was a significant relation between knowledge level <b>of</b> self directed <b>patient</b> <b>care</b> and educational level (P= 0. 00 (, and economical status (P= 0. 01) <b>of</b> the <b>patients.</b> The practice level <b>of</b> self directed <b>patient</b> <b>care</b> was significantly related to economical status (p= 0. 03) in this group <b>of</b> <b>patients.</b> ConclusionThese results indicate that an increase in knowledge level <b>of</b> self directed <b>patient</b> <b>care</b> and practice in diabetic patients can significantly improve their health. So it is necessary to consider training programs for diabetic patients especially for illiterate and patients with a lower economic status.
