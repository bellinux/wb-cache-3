60|$|She shuddered, looked <b>overside</b> at the water, {{and made}} a move.|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, {{two young}} fellows {{appeared}} on deck {{and dropped the}} cooking-stove <b>overside</b> with a line attached.|$|E
60|$|Henry was {{the fourteenth}} {{of us to}} go <b>overside</b> into the dark and salty {{disintegration}} of the sea. And in one day he has been well avenged; {{for two of the}} mutineers have followed him. The steward called my attention to what was taking place. He touched my arm half beyond his servant's self, as he gloated for'ard at the men heaving two corpses <b>overside.</b> Weighted with coal, they sank immediately, so that we could not identify them.|$|E
50|$|The Halliburton Townhouses are {{a pair of}} {{virtually}} identical residential buildings at 1601 and 1605 Center Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. They are two story wood frame Classical Revival structures, dominated by <b>oversides</b> two-story gabled porticos supported by Corinthian columns. They were built in 1905 or 1906 {{in what was then}} one of the most fashionable neighborhoods of the city. They were probably built by Thomas Halliburton, a prominent local landowner who once ran for mayor.|$|R
50|$|The White House {{is located}} south of Belfast's central {{business}} district, {{at the southern}} end of Church Street, occupying a triangular lot at the corner of High Street. It is a two story wood frame structure, with a hip roof topped by a widow's walk and cupola, and a granite foundation. The front and sides are finished in flushboard siding, with clapboards elsewhere. The building corners have <b>oversides</b> pilasters with Doric capitals, rising to a multi-level entablature that encircles the building. The main facade is three bays wide, the center one projecting and rising to a gabled roof. The main entrance, and a second floor balcony entrance, are both recessed in this projecting, the recessed area articulated by pilasters and fluted columns.|$|R
5000|$|After {{completing}} Rice Boy in 2008, Evan Dahm went on {{to create}} Order of Tales. Presented as a more traditional high fantasy epic, Order of Tales takes place 400 years before the events of Rice Boy and follows the hero Koark, the son {{of one of the}} guardians of <b>Overside’s</b> most important stories. Order of Tales starts off as Koark's father is murdered and his final act is to bestow the title of [...] "Teller" [...] on his son and command him to find a secret story known as The Ascent of the Bone Ziggurat. Koark meets The One Electronic, who sends him on an errand to a apothecary who may know something about the story. Dahm's character designs for Order of Tales is deliberately simple, as he only used more bizarre figures in order to a sense of intrigue or menace. Lauren Davis described Order of Tales as a classic hero's journey and noted its bittersweet ending.|$|R
60|$|The captain, slouch-hatted and barelegged, with {{a rolling}} twist hitched the faded blue lava-lava tighter {{around his waist}} and spat tobacco juice <b>overside.</b>|$|E
60|$|Back {{on board}} his {{schooner}} and dozing in a deck chair under a three-months-old magazine, David Grief was aroused by a sobbing, slubbering noise from <b>overside.</b> He opened his eyes. From the Chilian cruiser, {{a quarter of}} a mile away, came the stroke of eight bells. It was midnight. From <b>overside</b> came a splash and another slubbering noise. To him it seemed half amphibian, half the sounds of a man crying to himself and querulously chanting his sorrows to the general universe.|$|E
60|$|A heavier flaw of wind {{struck the}} back of his neck and whistled by his ears. He {{measured}} the weight of it, and looked quickly <b>overside.</b>|$|E
60|$|Momentarily stunned, Gahan's fingers {{slipped from}} their hold upon the cordage {{and the man}} shot {{downward}} through the thin air of dying Mars toward the ground three thousand feet beneath, while upon {{the deck of the}} rolling Vanator his faithful warriors clung to their lashings all unconscious of the fate of their beloved leader; nor was it until more than an hour later, after the storm had materially subsided, that they realized he was lost, or knew the self-sacrificing heroism of the act that had sealed his doom. The Vanator now rested upon an even keel as she was carried along by a strong, though steady, wind. The warriors had cast off their deck lashings and the officers were taking account of losses and damage when a weak cry was heard from <b>oversides,</b> attracting their attention to the man hanging in the cordage beneath the keel. Strong arms hoisted him to the deck and then it was that the crew of the Vanator learned of the heroism of their jed and his end. How far they had traveled since his loss they could only vaguely guess, nor could they return in search of him in the disabled condition of the ship. It was a saddened company that drifted onward through the air toward whatever destination Fate was to choose for them.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's me," [...] said Mr. Pyecroft, as a {{black and}} coal-stained dinghy--I did not foresee how well I should come to know her--was flung <b>overside</b> by three men.|$|E
60|$|Captain Dan Cullen smoked another long, silent minute. Then {{he removed}} the cigar from his mouth. He glanced aloft at the spars of the Mary Rogers, and <b>overside</b> at the sea.|$|E
60|$|But to return. Mr. Pike {{had just}} {{relieved}} me yesterday afternoon, {{when the second}} mate climbed the forecastle-head and sauntered to the very eyes of the Elsinore, where he stood gazing <b>overside.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{just about}} the size of it, old man. And calling hard names won't help any. There's the wind coming. You'd better get <b>overside</b> before I pull out, or I'll tow your canoe under." ...|$|E
60|$|Manuel nudged Dan, who darted to the after-tackle, and, leaning far <b>overside,</b> {{slipped the}} hook into the stern-rope as Manuel made her fast forward. The others pulled gallantly and swung the boat in--man, fish, and all.|$|E
60|$|They {{elevated}} {{the end of}} the hatch-cover with pitiful haste, and, like a dog flung <b>overside,</b> the dead man slid feet first into the sea. The coal at his feet dragged him down. He was gone.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Yes, but 'twas a apple," [...] says I, and {{he laughed}} like he always did at me. [...] "Do you ever feel minded to jump <b>overside</b> {{and be done with}} everything?" [...] he asks after a while.|$|E
6000|$|... "Looks like {{petroleum}} {{mixed with}} castor oil," [...] the mate grumbled, as he spat his disgust <b>overside.</b> [...] "My {{mother used to}} dose me with messes like that when I was a kid. Lord, she's getting black!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By God, Davis!" [...] {{the mate}} burst forth. [...] "You'll never draw your pay-day in Seattle. I'll fix you out for this, killing a crazy lashed {{down in his}} bunk an' harmless. You'll follow 'm <b>overside,</b> my hearty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Huh!" [...] {{he said to}} me, in {{reference}} to the crew; [...] "I gave 'em a taste of real old-fashioned sailing. They'll never forget this hooker--at least them that don't take a sack of coal <b>overside</b> before we reach port." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{rose and}} went upstairs, and Fraser with a cheerful glance at Mrs. Wheeler entered into {{conversation}} with her husband about <b>overside</b> work in the docks, until the door was pushed open a little to reveal Miss Tyrell ready for walking.|$|E
6000|$|The wave had slouched <b>overside</b> with a plop and a chuckle; but [...] "Plenty more {{where he}} came from," [...] said a brother-wave, and went through and over the capstan, who was bolted firmly to an iron plate on the iron deck-beams below.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lave ut, you bloody butchers," [...] Mahoney said quietly. [...] "Lave ut, I tell yez. Ye'll not be needin' anny iv ut now. 'Tis as I said: ye'll not be profitin' by the lad's blood. Empty ut <b>overside,</b> Behane. Empty ut overside." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{conversation}} was becoming rather a farcical dissertation upon the relations that should obtain between states, irrespective of size, {{when it was}} broken off by a cry from Tambi, who, with another lantern hanging <b>overside</b> {{at the end of}} his arm had made a discovery.|$|E
60|$|Michael, {{aware of}} the {{excitement}} <b>overside</b> but unable to see because of the rail, leaped {{on top of the}} cabin and at sight of the monster barked defiantly. Every eye turned on him in startlement and fear, and Steward hushed him with a whispered command.|$|E
60|$|Next morning, after breakfast, Thomas Mugridge {{began his}} whet, whet, whet. I glanced warily at him, for I {{was on my}} knees taking the ashes from the stove. When I {{returned}} from throwing them <b>overside,</b> {{he was talking to}} Harrison, whose honest yokel’s face was filled with fascination and wonder.|$|E
60|$|He {{was just}} putting his foot {{out on the}} damp deck when he heard his wife scream. It was a startled frightened scream that ended in a splash <b>overside.</b> He leaped out and ran aft. In the dim starlight {{he could make out}} her head and {{shoulders}} disappearing astern in the lazy wake.|$|E
60|$|I {{have acted}} on {{this bit of}} logic. I began {{experimentally}} by tossing small chunks of fat pork and crusts of stale bread <b>overside.</b> When the birds descended for the feast I shot them. Every carcass thus left floating {{on the surface of}} the sea was so much less meat for the mutineers.|$|E
60|$|When I {{came back}} {{it was still}} pulsing. I heard a splash <b>overside</b> from the waist of the ship, and knew the carcass had been flung overboard. I did not go around the chart-house and join Miss West, but stood enthralled by the {{spectacle}} of that heart that beat in the tropic heat.|$|E
6000|$|No; as I {{contemplate}} this roll-call of {{the dead}} which I have just made I see {{that we are not}} playing a boy's game. Why, we have lost a third of us, and the bloodiest battles of history have rarely achieved such a percentage of mortality. Fourteen of us have gone <b>overside,</b> and who can tell the end? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And 'bother your orders,' {{said she}} to me," [...] Oleson cried. [...] "'I'm your boss now,' said she, 'and {{you take your}} orders from me.' 'Look at that load of ivory nuts,' I said. 'Bother them,' said she; 'I'm playin' for {{something}} bigger than ivory nuts. We'll dump them <b>overside</b> {{as soon as we}} get under way.'" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{engineer}} {{disappeared into}} his den, {{and a moment}} later the exhaust muffler coughed and spluttered <b>overside.</b> But the schooner could not hold her lead. The little cutter made three feet to her two and was quickly alongside and forging ahead. Only natives were on her deck, and the man steering waved his hand in derisive greeting and farewell.|$|E
60|$|It {{was when}} he was thus below that the cow grazed the {{schooner}} just for'ard of amidships on the port side, lashed out with her mighty tail as she sounded, and ripped clean away the chain plates and rail of the mizzen-shrouds. In the next roll of the huge, glassy sea, the mizzen- mast fell <b>overside.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Harvey sat up to {{unfasten}} the belt, facing the head {{that had no}} face under its streaming hair. [...] "He's fast still," [...] he whispered to Dan, who slipped out his knife and cut the line, as Harvey flung the belt far <b>overside.</b> The body shot down with a plop, and Dan cautiously rose to his knees, whiter than the fog.|$|E
6000|$|... "Swing {{out that}} {{starboard}} boat, Mr. Jackson," [...] the captain commanded, staring after the foaming {{course of the}} cow as she surged away for a fresh onslaught. [...] "But don't lower it. Hold it <b>overside</b> in the falls, or that damned fish'll smash it. Just swing it out, ready and waiting, let the men get their bags, then stow food and water aboard of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{yet there}} is not the {{slightest}} evidence of foul play. Nobody knows what happened to the carpenter. There are no clues, no traces. The night was calm and snowy. No seas broke on board. Without doubt the clumsy, big-footed, over-grown giant of a boy is <b>overside</b> and dead. The question is: did he go over of his own accord, or was he put over? ...|$|E
