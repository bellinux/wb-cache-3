40|$|The {{penetration}} of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a), Buserelin (Hoechst AG, Frankfurt, West Germany), into human follicular fluids (FF) was studied {{by means of}} a radioimmunoassay (RIA) and a bioassay. Acute nasal administration of a therapeutic dose of Buserelin (300 and 600 micrograms) before the <b>ovum</b> <b>pickup</b> for in vitro fertilization leads to significant concentrations of Buserelin in one-third of the FF. These concentrations ranged between 28 and 124 pg/ml, which represents 10 % to 50 % of the serum concentrations achieved in these patients. Follicular {{penetration of}} this agonist is time-dependent. Chronic administration during the follicular phase leads to low but significant concentrations of peptide 36 hours after the last inhalation. A very good correlation was observed between the RIA and the bioassay. This demonstrates the accuracy and the specificity of the RIA. In addition, it indicates that the Buserelin that reaches follicles is intact and is not the inactive product of degradation. Intranasal administration of Buserelin stopped 35 hours before <b>ovum</b> <b>pickup</b> appears to be an adequate way of minimizing the exposure of maturing oocytes to the GnRH-a...|$|E
40|$|Maternal {{age is a}} {{significant}} factor in infertility treatment. Ovarian function and oocyte quality decrease with age, whereas the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities increases. In this study, improvement of oocyte quality and ovarian function were attempted using a herbal medicine comprising 7 crude drugs:Angelicae radix,Rehmanniae radix,Plantaginis semen,Lonicerae flos,Carthami flos,Ginseng radix, andCucurbita moschata Duch. Thirty-one women who repeatedly failed to conceive by intracytoplasmic sperm injection took the herbal medicine before breakfast and dinner from the start of menstrual cycle in the <b>ovum</b> <b>pickup</b> cycle. Average patient age was 38. 5 ± 0. 7 years, and the average <b>ovum</b> <b>pickup</b> frequency on the first dosage day was 7. 9 ± 1. 5. To analyze the effects of herbal medicine intake, the number of recovered and mature oocytes, their morphology and physical qualities, as well as the rates of fertilization, oocyte development, and pregnancy was compared before and after intake. The recovered and mature oocyte numbers, oocyte morphology and physical qualities, and fertilization rate were not significantly different before and after drug intake. However, the oocyte development rate was significantly higher(58. 0 %) after herbal medicine intake than before (32. 5 %; p = 0. 0003). Moreover, the successful pregnancy rate was significantly higher after intake than before (6. 9 % versus 0 %; p = 0. 0111).

30|$|Although stage III and IV endometriosis suggest {{advanced}} disease, endometrial implants and adhesions {{are frequently}} not symmetrically {{distributed in the}} pelvis [1] allowing {{for the possibility that}} one adnexa may be relatively free of mechanical factors of infertility. The fact that one adnexa may have less disease may positively influence the pregnancy rate reported as a result of surgical treatment of advanced endometriosis. That is to say, the pregnancy occurs as a result of ovulation/tubal <b>ovum</b> <b>pickup</b> from the side with less adnexal pathology. However, in such cases the resulting pregnancy {{may be due to the}} effect of ablation of endometrial implant, as in patients with minimal or mild endometriosis [2]. If such a hypothesis is true, the pregnancy rate should be much less in patients with bilateral adnexal involvement. To examine this hypothesis, we therefore studied the effect of unilateral versus bilateral adnexal involvement on the pregnancy rate after operative laparoscopy for infertile patients with advanced endometriosis. We also studied the pregnancy and delivery rates in these two groups and in the total population after different infertility treatment methods were used.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} several decades, a number of therapies have been {{developed}} that manipulate ovarian follicle growth to improve oocyte quality and conception rates in cattle. Various strategies have been proposed to improve the responses to reproductive biotechnologies following timed artificial insemination (TAI), superovulation (SOV) or <b>ovum</b> <b>pickup</b> (OPU) programmes. During TAI protocols, final follicular growth {{and size of the}} ovulatory follicle are key factors that may significantly influence oocyte quality, ovulation, the uterine environment and consequently pregnancy outcomes. Progesterone concentrations during SOV protocols influence follicular growth, oocyte quality and embryo quality; therefore, several adjustments to SOV protocols have been proposed depending on the animal category and breed. In addition, the success of in vitro embryo production {{is directly related to the}} number and quality of cumulus oocyte complexes harvested by OPU. Control of follicle development has a significant impact on the OPU outcome. This article discusses a number of key points related to the manipulation of ovarian follicular growth to maximize oocyte quality and improve conception rates following TAI and embryo transfer of in vivo-and in vitro-derived embryos in cattle.

40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Genome editing tools enable efficient and accurate genome manipulation. An enhanced ability {{to modify the}} genomes of livestock species could be utilized to improve disease resistance, productivity or breeding capability {{as well as the}} generation of new biomedical models. To date, with respect to the direct injection of genome editor mRNA into livestock zygotes, this technology has been limited to the generation of pigs with edited genomes. To capture the far-reaching applications of gene-editing, from disease modelling to agricultural improvement, the technology must be easily applied to a number of species using a variety of approaches. In this study, we demonstrate zygote injection of TALEN mRNA can also produce gene-edited cattle and sheep. In both species we have targeted the myostatin (MSTN) gene. In addition, we report a critical innovation for application of gene-editing to the cattle industry whereby gene-edited calves can be produced with specified genetics by <b>ovum</b> <b>pickup,</b> in vitro fertiliza-tion and zygote microinjection (OPU-IVF-ZM). This provides a practical alternative to somatic cell nuclear transfer for gene knockout or introgression of desir-able alleles into a target breed/genetic line...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the capacity of}} baseline characteristics and total motile sperm count (TMC) to predict total fertilization failure (TIFF) in patients undergoing IVF. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: University hospital. Patient(s) : Eight hundred ninety-two couples {{with a total of}} 1. 569 consecutive IVF cycles. Intervention(s) : Prewash and postwash TMC during fertility workup and at the time of <b>ovum</b> <b>pickup</b> (OPU). Main Outcome Measure(s) : Analysis of logistic regression and the receiver operating characteristic curve were used to determine which variables could be used to predict TIFF. Result(s) : The area under the curve (AUC) for prewash TMC during fertility workup was 0. 72, similar to a combination of pre- and postwash TMC. At the time of OPU. both pre- and postwash TMC had an AUC of 0. 73. A model based on selected baseline characteristics (male age. number of IVF cycles, indication for IVF, and prewash TMC during fertility work-up) had an AUC of 0. 75. A model at the time of OPU, including the number of oocytes. had an AUC of 0. 80. Conclusion(s) : The use of both models. one before start of the IVF cycle and one at the time of OPU, allows an accurate prediction of the chance of TFF and is useful in counseling patients on whether to opt for IVF or ICSI.

40|$|The {{present study}} aims to report <b>ovum</b> <b>pickup</b> (OPU), in vitro embryo {{production}} (IVEP) and embryo transfer (ET) outcomes of fresh and vitrified buffalo embryos. For this purpose, 36 buffalo donors were submitted to 11 OPU sessions (n = 201). A total of 998 oocytes (5. 0 +/- 0. 5 /donor/session) and 584 viable oocytes (2. 9 +/- 0. 3 /donor/session) were recovered. Viable oocytes (grades 1, 2 and 3) {{were subjected to}} IVM, IVF (D 0) and IVC. On D 2, 54. 5 % of cleavage rate was obtained. Embryo yield on D 7 was 44. 9 % (grade 1 : 229 embryos, grade 2 : 5 embryos and grade 3 : 28 embryos). From this total, 115 fresh (grades 1 to 3) and 70 vitrified embryos (only grade 1) were transferred into recipients previously synchronized with fixed time embryo transfer (FTET) protocol. Vitrification was performed using the cryotop method. Pregnancy diagnosis in fresh and in vitrified groups were, respectively: 43. 5 % (50 / 115) and 37. 1 % (26 / 70) on 30 days after embryo transfer, and 41. 7 % (48 / 115) and 31. 4 % (22 / 70) on 60 days after embryo transfer.

40|$|Background: A {{relationship}} between ‘oocyte quality’ and follicular fluid hormones is expected, since its formation {{coincides with the}} ‘oocyte maturation’ phase. The {{aim of this study}} was to find a possible relation between oocyte quality with follicular luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol (E 2) as hormonal parameters of oocyte quality during <b>ovum</b> <b>pickup</b> for intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Methods: Concentrations of LH and E 2 in individual follicular fluid samples obtained during assisted reproduction treatment were related to oocyte nuclear maturation, fertilization and embryo grading. E 2 and LH differences between individual groups of oocytes and embryos were calculated using the paired Student’s t test and ANOVA test. Results: Follicular E 2 levels showed a significant positive correlation with oocyte nuclear maturation, fertilization and embryo grading being higher in follicles whose oocytes had matured nucleus (475  ±  142. 9  ng/ml vs. 332  ±  76. 4  ng/ml, P value < 0. 001), normally fertilized (502. 5  ±  131. 3  ng/ml vs. 339. 8  ±  78. 3  ng/ml, P value < 0. 001) and developed into good quality embryos (596. 9  ±  72. 4  ng/ml grade A vs. 511. 7  ±  73  ng/ml grade B vs. 310. 9  ±  57  ng/ml grade C, P value < 0. 001). However Follicular LH was only positively correlated with oocyte nuclear maturation. Conclusions: The local follicular environment may play a key role in the observed differences in oocyte quality. Our results suggest that the use follicular E 2 may be of value in the assessment of oocyte quality. If there is a marker for oocyte quality, it would be possible to select oocytes rather than embryos, which may improve selection criteria of the best embryo to transfer, therefore increases success rate of ICSI...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of long-chain fatty acid soaps (LCFAS) of soybean oil on the production and quality of aspirated cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) of lactating Nellore (Bos taurus indicus) cows. The effects of LCFAS on the plasma concentration of lipoproteins, total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, urea N, and insulin were also addressed. Thirty lactating Nellore cows were {{randomly assigned to one of}} two dietary groups. Cows were grazed on a Tifton 85 pasture throughout the experiment (100 days). Treatments consisted of a supplement with no fat included (CONT); and a supplement containing 47. 2 g/kg of LCFAS on a dry matter basis. After 14 days of treatment, animals were subjected to 4. 93 ± 1. 55 rounds of consecutive <b>ovum</b> <b>pickup</b> (OPU) at intervals of 21. 71 ± 11. 76 days. Blood samples were collected from all cows throughout the experiment at 25 -day intervals (four samples per cow). Cows that were fed LCFAS supplements and cows that were fed CONT supplements had similar numbers of total aspirated oocytes (viable and not viable) by OPU and grades of viable oocytes. Plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were increased in cows supplemented with LCFAS. Plasma concentrations of LDL and total cholesterol were increased by LCFAS supplementation after 50 days on dietary treatment and insulin concentration was increased from 75 days on treatment. Long-chain fatty acid soaps from soybean oil added at 47. 2 g/kg have no effect on the number of aspirated COC or their quality in Nellore lactating cows even with changes in plasma concentration of HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, and insulin. Thus, this supplementation has no benefits when the main objective is to improve oocyte production and quality...|$|E
40|$|Endometriosis is {{a common}} disease that affects up to 10 % of women of {{reproductive}} age. In women with pelvic pain, in-fertility or both, its frequency is 35 %– 50 % (1 – 3). Severe endometriosis decreases female factor fertility by many mechanisms such as distortion of pelvic anatomy, impair-ment of oocyte release in an inflammatory hostile peritoneal environment, difficulty in <b>ovum</b> <b>pickup</b> and transport through the tube, and impairment of implantation and embryo devel-opment (3, 4). Despite the vast amount {{of research in the}} last decade, the relationship between endometriosis and infertil-ity is not completely understood. Oxidative stress (OS) has been proposed as a possible mechanism that is involved in the pathophysiology of endometriosis (5, 6) by promoting growth and adhesion of endometrial cells in the peritoneal cavity. Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been found to increase in the serum and peritoneal fluid (PF) of patients with endometriosis (7, 8). OS has been shown to exert toxic effects on sperm, dam-aging the sperm cell membrane, inducing DNA damage, and mediating sperm apoptosis (9, 10). Membrane lipid peroxidation is believed to be an important mechanism that occurs in the spermatozoa as a result of exposure to excessive ROS (11). As a consequence of lipid peroxida-tion, the plasma membrane loses the fluidity and integrity it requires for participation in the membrane fusion events associated with fertilization (11, 12). Furthermore, OS-me-diated DNA damage interferes with the sperm DNA integ-rity required for achieving and sustaining normal embryo development (13). Abnormally high levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) {{have been reported in the}} PF of females with endo-metriosis. TNF-a has been proposed as a sensitive marker for the nonsurgical diagnosis of endometriosis (7, 8, 14). In vitro incubation of motile sperm with TNF-a has produced sper...|$|E

In this study, we assessed the effect of melatonin on the ART outcomes in women with DOR. A double-blinded, randomized, clinical trial was performed on 80 women with DOR as a pilot study in Shiraz, between 2014 and 2015. DOR {{was defined as the}} presence of 2 of the following 3 criteria: 1) anti-Müllerian hormone ≤ 1, 2) folliclestimulating hormone ≥ 10, and 3) bilateral antral follicle count ≤ 6. The women received 3 mg/d melatonin or a placebo since the fifth day of one cycle prior to gonadotropin stimulation and continued the treatment up to the time of <b>ovum</b> <b>pickup.</b> The ART outcomes were compared between the groups using SPSS software. Finally, there were 32 women in the case and 34 in the placebo groups. The mean age and basal ovarian reserve test were the same between the groups. The serum estradiol level on the triggering day was significantly higher in the case group (P= 0. 005). The mean number of MII oocytes was higher in the case group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance.

40|$|Relationships between immune and {{endocrine}} systems seem {{to occur}} in ovarian follicular fluids (FF). Lymphomonocytes {{have been found in}} preovulatory follicles and their specific products, cytokines [interleukin- 1 (IL 1), IL 2], were demonstrated to inhibit steroidogenesis. Ovarian steroids, in turn, reduce the cytokine production from immune-competent cells. In the present study we evaluated whether lymphomonocytes are present in FF, and if both their subset distribution and their IL 1 alpha and IL 2 secretions, after activation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), {{are similar to those of}} peripheral blood. Interferences of IL 1 alpha and IL 2 production by FF lymphomonocytes caused by isolated granulosa cells were also evaluated. The study was performed on 86 FFs obtained from follicles containing mature oocytes that were aspirated at the time of <b>ovum</b> <b>pickup</b> from 27 women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with exogenous gonadotropins for an in vitro fertilization (IVF) program [IVF-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) or gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) ]. Lymphocytes were found in FF. The distribution of CD 8 + and CD 3 + lymphocyte subsets is equal to that in peripheral blood, but the percentage of CD 11 b+, CD 16 +, and CD 4 + cells (its trend) is higher in FF than in peripheral blood. The amount of IL 2 and IL 1 alpha deriving from PHA-activated FF lymphomonocytes is similar to that of peripheral blood PHA-activated lymphomonocytes. Granulosa cells significantly blunt IL 2 and IL 1 alpha production by FF lymphomonocytes. These results suggest that preovulation, a migration of lymphomonocytes from the peripheral compartment to the follicle occurs. However, unfavorable effects of IL 2 and IL 1 alpha, cytotoxic and antisteroidogenetic activities, are counteracted by the products of granulosa cells. The higher amounts of CD 11 b+, CD 16 +, and CD 4 + in FF suggest that they could be involved in other immune processes...|$|E
40|$|In this {{preliminary}} study, in vitro embryo production and cryopreservation in two river type buffaloes (Murrah and Nili-Ravi) imported into China {{have been carried}} out. The objective {{of the study was}} enhancement of the genetic merit and productive performances of imported river buffaloes in conjunction with the utilization of local swamp buffaloes. In order to improve milk and meat production in China local swamp buffaloes (2 n = 48), which are the predominant subspecies, have been crossbred with imported river buffaloes (Murrah and Nili-Ravi: 2 n = 50). At present, several hundred thousand crossbred heads have been produced, and although both males and females can reproduce with 2 n = 49 crossbred buffaloes, their reproductive performances are significantly reduced when compared to 2 n = 50 buffaloes. As an alternative approach, a program of embryo production in river buffaloes and transfer into both river and swamp buffaloes has been implemented at the Guangxi Buffalo Research Institute, in Nanning, P. R. China. Some preliminary results are presented: from a start-up experiment, a total of 46 river buffaloes were subjected to 2 to 3 <b>ovum</b> <b>pickup</b> sessions at 4 -day intervals. A total of 750 antral follicles were punctured and 495 (66 %) cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were retrieved. Only COCs characterized by at least one layer of granulosa cells (n = 451; 91. 1 %) were considered for in vitro maturation (IVM). COCs were matured in TCM 199 + 10 % FCS, 0. 5 μg/mL FSH, 5 μg/mL LH, and 1 μg/mL estradiol in the presence of cysteamine (50 μM) at 39 °C under 5 % CO 2 in humidified air for 24 h. Of the initial 451 COCs matured, only 277 could be considered for in vitro fertilization (IVF). IVF was performed at 39 °C under CO 2 in humidified air in TALP medium supplemented with 0. 2 mM penicillamine, 0. 1 mM hypotaurine, and 0. 01 mM heparin. Frozen/thawed sperm from a tested bull was treated by swim-up procedure and used at a final concentration of 20 million/mL. Following 20 to 22 h of co-incubation, presumptive zygotes were cultured in SOF medium, supplemented with essential and non-essential amino acids and 8 mg/mL BSA, in a gas atmosphere of 5 % CO 2, 7 % O 2, and 88 % N 2. A total of 41 (14. 8 %) blastocysts were produced, of which 33 were vitrified and 8 transferred immediately into available swamp and river buffalo recipients. Two calves were born (25 %) from the transfer of fresh embryos into one river and one swamp buffalo. In vitro embryo production in the buffalo species is still characterized by a high degree of variable results. However, these preliminary results reinforce the need to implement newly developed reproductive technologies not only for speeding up genetic gain of already productive species, but also for the utilization of local breeds characterized by reduced productive performance...|$|E
