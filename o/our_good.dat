25|$|The news of {{the victory}} was {{received}} in Britain with the warmest enthusiasm. It was the first certain sign that the mutinies of the summer had not destroyed {{the power and the}} prestige of the Royal Navy. Duncan was at once (21 October) raised to the peerage as Viscount Duncan, of Camperdown, and Baron Duncan, of Lundie in the Shire of Perth (with which came the lands now known as Camperdown Park in Dundee), and there was a strong feeling that the reward was inadequate. Even as early as 18 October his aunt, Lady Mary Duncan, wrote to Henry Dundas, at that time secretary of state for war: Report says my nephew is only made a Viscount. Myself it is nothing, but the whole nation thinks the least you can do is to give him an English earldom. … Am sure were this properly represented to <b>our</b> <b>good</b> king, who esteems a brave, religious man like himself, would be of my opinion. …. It was not, however, till 1831, many years after Duncan's death, that his son, then bearing his title, was raised to the dignity of an earl, and his other children to the rank and precedence of the children of an earl.|$|E

Overall, this week was really well done - very effectively creepy, well directed and plotted {{with just the right}} about of gore to make you jump". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "Marionette" [...] the eleventh best episode of the series, calling it [...] "a strong, disturbing outing that was part of Fringes mid-series peak, in which the show found its best storytelling voice by crafting strange, emotionally resonant case-of-the-week plots that thematically paralleled the ongoing character arcs in ways that felt organic, not contrived." [...] In a similar 2013 list, Den of Geek ranked the episode as the third best of the entire series.|$|E

In August 1950, shortly before Tottenham embarked on their first top-flight season since they had been relegated {{at the end of}} the 1934–35 campaign, Rowe told the club's annual meeting: [...] "As much as anything else, I would rate <b>our</b> <b>good</b> time last year to the acquisition of Alf Ramsey."

On 28 April 1951, with a 1–0 home victory over Sheffield Wednesday, Tottenham were crowned champions of England only a year after promotion.
