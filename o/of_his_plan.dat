5|$|At {{the same}} time, Pei {{designed}} a new museum for Luxembourg, the Musée d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean, {{commonly known as}} the Mudam. Drawing from the original shape of the Fort Thüngen walls where the museum was located, Pei planned to remove a portion of the original foundation. Public resistance to the historical loss forced a revision <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>plan,</b> however, and the project was nearly abandoned. The size of the building was halved, and it was set back from the original wall segments to preserve the foundation. Pei was disappointed with the alterations, but remained involved in the building process even during construction.|$|E

When he discovers that Devon is planning to shut down GE, Jack, with Liz's help, convinces Kathy to hire him as her business adviser. Devon, realizing that he has been beaten, decides on a new path to securing his financial future: hurling himself in front of a series of moving cars so that he can sue the drivers.|$|E
5|$|Desperate Housewives {{focuses on}} the {{residents}} living in the suburban neighborhood of Wisteria Lane. In previous episodes, Mike Delfino (James Denton) learns {{that he is the}} biological father of Zach Young (Cody Kasch), whose adopted parents, Mary Alice (Brenda Strong) and Paul (Mark Moses), killed Mike's previous girlfriend and Zach's biological mother years earlier. Mike kidnapped Paul and left him stranded in the desert while Zach holds Mike's current girlfriend, Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher) hostage as part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>plan</b> to kill Mike. Tom Scavo (Doug Savant) quit his job and decided to become a stay-at-home father, forcing his wife, Lynette (Felicity Huffman) to reenter the work force. Gabrielle Solis's (Eva Longoria) affair with her teenage gardener, John Rowland (Jesse Metcalfe), is exposed just as she discovers she is pregnant and her husband, Carlos (Ricardo Antonio Chavira), is sentenced to time in prison. Bree Van de Kamp (Marcia Cross) learned that her husband, Rex (Steven Culp), died while awaiting surgery. Also, Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard) and her son, Matthew (Mehcad Brooks), moved to Wisteria Lane.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Mawson had {{accompanied}} Ernest Shackleton's 1907–09 British Antarctic Expedition. Along with Edgeworth David and Alistair Mackay, {{he had been}} part of a man-hauled sledging expedition, the first to reach the area of the South Magnetic Pole. Upon his return from Antarctica, he recommenced to his post as geology lecturer at the University of Adelaide. Despite an offer from Robert Falcon Scott to join his Terra Nova Expedition to reach the Geographic South Pole, Mawson began planning his own Antarctic expedition. Mawson's plan, which led to the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, envisaged three bases on the Antarctic continent, collectively surveying much of the coast directly south of Australia. He approached Shackleton, who not only approved <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>plan</b> but was prepared to lead the expedition himself. Although Shackleton withdrew from the expedition in December 1910, he continued to assist Mawson with publicity and fund-raising.|$|E

5|$|From the start, one of {{the main}} efforts of the Confederate Navy was to counter the {{blockade}} of its ports by the Union Navy. Mallory believed that by attacking the merchant shipping that carried trade to Northern ports he could force his Union counterpart, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, to divert his own small fleet to defend against the raiders. In {{the early days of the}} war, the Confederacy tried to enlist the services of private shipowners in the service by offering letters of marque and reprisal. Issuance of the letters was not in the purview of the Navy Department, but Mallory was aware of them and saw them as part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>plan.</b> For several reasons, the privateers did not have the success that was hoped for. Although they ventured out throughout the war, they had only fleeting success, and that had ceased by the end of the first year.|$|E
5|$|In the , Palpatine was {{voiced by}} Ian Abercrombie from 2008 {{to his death}} in 2012, and by Tim Curry from 2012 to 2014. In the series, Palpatine {{continues}} to serve as Supreme Chancellor while his Sith identity remains behind the scenes via holograms. In the second season, Sidious hires bounty hunter Cad Bane to infiltrate the Jedi Temple and steal a holocron. He then takes a valuable Kyber memory crystal that contains the names of thousands of Force-sensitive younglings - {{the future of the}} Jedi Order - from around the galaxy. The final stage of the plot: to bring four Force-sensitive children to Sidious's secret facility on Mustafar. Anakin and Ahsoka again foil the plot, but Bane escapes and all evidence of Sidious' involvement is lost. In the fifth season, Sidious personally travels to the planet Mandalore to confront his former apprentice Darth Maul after becoming leader of Death Watch, killing Savage Opress before torturing Maul with the intent to make use of him. In the final season, Sidious goes to lengths to conceal the full nature <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>plan</b> from the Jedi by attempting to silence the Clone Trooper Fives when he learns of Order 66 and having Dooku wipe out anything tied to Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas.|$|E
5|$|Kor (John Colicos), a revered Klingon warrior, is in Quark's Bar {{telling stories}} of past battles {{to his friend}} Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell). She notices Lieutenant Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) nearby and invites him to meet Kor, who greets Worf happily, saying that anyone who is so {{strongly}} disliked by the Klingon government {{is a friend of}} his. He explains to Jadzia and Worf that he is on the station as part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>plan</b> to find the legendary Sword of Kahless. The sword is the original bat'leth, used by Kahless to defeat the tyrant Molor. Kor received a shroud from a Vulcan science team, which he believes once held the Sword. He gives it to Jadzia to test the shroud's authenticity. As he returns to his quarters, Kor is attacked by a Lethean who reads his thoughts in order to find out about the Sword and then removes his memories of the attack. Jadzia finds him the following morning, and thinks that he has passed out from too much alcohol. She has verified the authenticity of the shroud. Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) lends the trio a Runabout to travel into the Gamma Quadrant to search for the sword on a planet where the Vulcan team found the shroud.|$|E

5|$|Since 1888, when Mahdist rebels {{forced the}} {{evacuation}} of then governor Emin Pasha, the Lado Enclave had been occupied by rebels {{under the leadership of}} Emir Arabi Dafalla. Rejaf was their strongest fortified position in the area, and it was there Arabi Dafalla stationed his equipment and soldiers. The establishment of Mahdist Sudan had provided the context for European powers to commence the invasion and colonization of the Sudan, in which King Leopold desperately wanted to take part in order to expand his Congolese empire. However, a direct military campaign into the area was not an option; Leopold {{would not have been able}} to get permission from either the French or the British according to the rules laid out in the 1884 Berlin Conference, especially considering both nations were looking to annex the Sudan themselves. King Leopold II therefore decided to disguise his campaign into the Sudan as an expeditionary force sent to reclaim the Lado Enclave from the Mahdists, although he inended to give his commanders covert orders to continue their advance far past the boundaries of Belgian territory, first to Fashoda and then on to Khartoum. After receiving a new loan of 6.5 million francs from the Belgian government in 1895, Leopold ordered preparations to be made for the execution <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|E
5|$|What Yamamoto did {{not know}} was that the U.S. had broken the main Japanese naval code (dubbed JN-25 by the Americans), divulging many details <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>plan</b> to the enemy. His {{emphasis}} on dispersal also meant none of his formations were {{in a position to}} support each other. For instance, despite the fact that Nagumo's carriers were expected to carry out strikes against Midway and bear the brunt of American counterattacks, the only warships in his fleet larger than the screening force of twelve destroyers were two Kongō-class fast battleships, two heavy cruisers, and one light cruiser. By contrast, Yamamoto and Kondo had between them two light carriers, five battleships, four heavy cruisers, and two light cruisers, none of which would see action at Midway. The light carriers of the trailing forces, and Yamamoto's three battleships, were unable {{to keep pace with the}} carriers of the Kido Butai and so could not have sailed in company with them. The distance between Yamamoto and Kondo's forces and Nagumo's carriers had grave implications during the battle: the invaluable reconnaissance capability of the scout planes carried by the cruisers and carriers, as well as the additional antiaircraft capability of the cruisers and the other two battleships of the Kongō-class in the trailing forces, was denied to Nagumo.|$|E
5|$|When he returns, Moody {{takes him}} to his office, and reveals himself to be Voldemort's 'faithful servant'; {{he was the one}} who put Harry's name into the Goblet of Fire, and has been guiding him through the tournament from behind the scenes to ensure that he would grab the Portkey first. Before Moody can kill Harry, Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape intervene. They learn that Moody is in fact Barty Crouch Jr., Mr. Crouch's son, {{disguised}} by Polyjuice Potion. Crouch had sentenced Crouch Jr. to life imprisonment in Azkaban over alleged ties to the Death Eaters but smuggled him out as a last favour to his dying wife. Crouch Jr. was the one who set off the Dark Mark at the Quidditch World Cup, doing it to scare the Death Eaters he felt had abandoned Voldemort. Eventually, Voldemort had gotten in contact with Crouch Jr. and had him impersonate Moody as part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>plan.</b> Crouch Jr. also admits to killing Crouch Sr., to prevent him telling Dumbledore about Voldemort. The real Moody is found inside Crouch Jr.'s enchanted trunk and rescued. Harry is then declared the winner of the Triwizard Tournament and given his winnings.|$|E

5|$|Ben Kaplan (Alex Lanipekun) {{breaks into}} Meynell's office {{to learn of}} deals between Highland Life and Salma, a Russian bank that {{according}} to Elizabeta Starkova (Paloma Baeza), has connections with the Russian mafia. It is also revealed Highland Life owes Salma £65 billion. It was this reason that earlier in the episode, Denham committed suicide. In order to get Meynell to trust her to become part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>plan,</b> Ros sleeps with him. Later, Calderwood receives a call from Asa Darlek (Stephen Noonan), Meynell's associate from Salma, and threatens to either have the £65 billion paid back, or he will go public to inform the country the true extent of its debts. Ros presents a third option; have Calderwood announce she will back Highland Life, {{while at the same}} time she will convince Meynell to bet against it. Such a plan would financially ruin Meynell. The next morning however, Darlek realises she is MI5 and threatens to kill her if Calderwood does not back down. Ros fights the gun off and Calderwood goes ahead with her statement. Later, Lucas releases Elizabeta as an asset. Meanwhile, Jo Portman (Miranda Raison) believes Boscard (Gus Gallagher), her captor from the end of series six, is still alive after seeing several hallucinations of him. Later, Ros puts her mind at rest when she shows Jo photographic evidence Boscard is indeed dead, and it was Jo who killed him.|$|E
