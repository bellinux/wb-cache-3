I come here green {{with only a}} desire to make our great country even greater. We have much work to do. In that spirit, I pledge to each of you that any disagreements we may have are just that and no more. Walking in each other's shoes takes effort and pause; however, it is my sincere hope that I never lose the patience to view each <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> human beings first, God's creatures, and foremost. I deeply appreciate this opportunity to serve with each of you. I very much look forward to getting to know you better.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of contemporary reviews were positive. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said Dreaming of You {{was the first}} recording by Selena to have been heard by {{the general population of}} the United States because her death attracted American listeners to her album. This was echoed by Alisa Valdes of the Boston Globe. Erlewine said Amor Prohibido is [...] "a more consistent release" [...] and that Dreaming of You was not the singer's best work, and he called it an introductory effort. According to Erlewine, the English-language tracks [...] on the album [...] "are no different than her Spanish songs"; he also said the album [...] "would have been stronger" [...] if the singer had lived. He finished his review by calling the album a [...] "powerful—and touching—testament to her talents". John Lannert of Billboard magazine called the album's commercial success [...] "hardly a fluke". Vibe magazine contributor Ed Morales, described the album as a summation of her cumbia-influenced songs, her Tex-Mex (Texas-Mexico) [...] "excellence", and a [...] "poignant glimpse" [...] of the path the singer's musical career may have taken had she lived. Writing for Time magazine, David Browne said Dreaming of Yous release was [...] "one of the quickest posthumous albums ever cobbled together". He said the producers who worked with Selena on the album had decisively paired her with recordings that reminded him of lighter versions of Paula Abdul and called them [...] "greeting-card sentiments". He recognized the later half of Dreaming <b>of</b> <b>You</b> <b>as</b> [...] "the true, unbridled Selena", calling them [...] "traditional ballads or tropical fantasies, Selena evokes lust and passion"; illustrating that those qualities found on her English-language songs are absent from the Spanish-language ones.|$|E
500|$|Writing for the New York Daily News, Mary Talbot said {{listening}} to Dreaming of You was [...] "akin to sifting through a dead woman's scrapbook" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "disparate jottings and snapshots some artful, some light, all weighted with nostalgia". Talbot said the album showcases [...] "Selena's past and outlines {{what could have been}} her future", and because of the singer's death, the story is incomplete. She called the English offerings [...] "sturdy, generic pop numbers" [...] that would be favored among her Tejano following [...] "but there aren't enough of them to prove her strength or breadth as an English-language artist". Talbot said Selena was skillful in crisscrossing [...] "traditional Mexican music with a contemporary American pop sensibility, and that skill doesn't figure with these songs". Towards the end of her review, Talbot said Dreaming of You is [...] "the effervescent pop of her generation". Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News said the album [...] "doesn't deliver", writing that Selena was [...] "revamped to sound like one of pop radio's many generic female vocalist" [...] and that her English recordings lack [...] "the bubbly, effervescent personality, the chica-del-barrio charm" [...] found on her Tejano songs. Tarradell said the English songs were [...] "tepid imitations of Amy Grant and Abdul". Peter Watrous of The New York Times called Dreaming of You [...] "a collection of leftovers" [...] and said the Spanish-language songs [...] "sound better" [...] than Selena's English ones. Watrous said the producers did not ameliorate Selena's English-language tracks and gave their all. He further wrote that [...] "the music is faceless commerce" [...] but that Selena recorded them [...] "so well on the album" [...] that it suggested [...] "she had a good chance of success, working lush ballads in an anonymous pop style that Disney has mastered". Rock music contributor Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant described Dreaming <b>of</b> <b>You</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a package that hints at the overall talent and immense potential of the young star". Catlin said her English-language works were lacking [...] "technical heroics that have defined [...] in the '90s." [...] but states the singer [...] "is understandably assured" [...] on her Spanish offerings. He said Selena was [...] "low key" [...] and that the material seemed that way because she had only recorded four English-language tracks before her death.|$|E
