2500|$|Control and {{ownership}} structure {{refers to the}} types and composition of shareholders in a corporation. In some countries such as most of Continental Europe, ownership is not necessarily equivalent to control due {{to the existence of}} e.g. dual-class shares, ownership pyramids, voting coalitions, proxy votes and clauses in the articles of association that confer additional voting rights to long-term shareholders. Ownership is typically defined as the ownership of cash flow rights whereas control refers to ownership of control or voting rights. Researchers often [...] "measure" [...] control {{and ownership}} structures by using some observable measures of control and <b>ownership</b> <b>concentration</b> or the extent of inside control and ownership. Some features or types of control and ownership structure involving corporate groups include pyramids, cross-shareholdings, rings, and webs. German [...] "concerns" [...] (Konzern) are legally recognized corporate groups with complex structures. Japanese keiretsu (系列) and South Korean chaebol (which tend to be family-controlled) are corporate groups which consist of complex interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. Cross-shareholding are an essential feature of keiretsu and chaebol groups [...] Corporate engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders can differ substantially across different control and ownership structures.|$|E

40|$|While high <b>ownership</b> <b>concentrations</b> in {{even the}} largest American {{corporations}} provide prima facie evidence that large minority shareholders wield control, the economics and finance literatures have mostly overlooked {{the question of how}} they do so. Using a simple framework adapted from work by Shleifer and Vishny (1986), this paper shows how minority shareholders can use takeover threats to discipline management. It then shows how they can bolster their threats, and hence their influence, simply by threatening to increase these minority stakes. When inside information is not too problematic, a relatively small stake can endow minority shareholders with considerable ongoing control. ...|$|R

Using the unique World Bank dataset covering more than 5, 000 firms across 59 countries, we find strong evidence that that state ownership of media is associated with higher levels of bank corruption. We also find that media concentration increases corruption both directly and indirectly through its interaction with media state ownership. In addition, we find that media state <b>ownership</b> and media <b>concentration</b> both accentuate the positive link between official supervisory power and lending corruption and attenuate the negative link between the regulations that empower private monitoring and corruption in lending. Furthermore, the links between media structure and corruption are more pronounced when the borrowing firm is privately owned...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effect of {{ownership}} on post-privatization performance in a virtually complete population of medium and large firms privatized in a model large-scale privatization economy (Czech Republic). We reject the hypothesis that domestic or foreign private ownership, in either moderate or high <b>ownership</b> <b>concentrations,</b> leads to increased sales. However, private domestic and foreign majority and significant minority owners, as well as dispersed owners, increase profitability relative to state-owned firms. Firms with dispersed ownership register higher positive effect on profit than firms with more concentrated ownership, thus giving support to theories stressing managerial autonomy and initiative. Foreign owners with high as well as moderate <b>concentrations</b> of <b>ownership</b> uniformly reduce financial leverage, as do majority domestic owners. Domestic banks and portfolio companies as single largest owners (SLO) are incapable of carrying out major restructuring. Foreign industrial company SLOs carry out strategic restructuring in production and financing without deviating from the state ownership benchmark {{in terms of the}} labor cost. The effect of SLO does not vary with the SLO’s <b>concentration</b> of <b>ownership.</b> Overall, private ownership tends to be associated with superior performance in terms of some indicators but not others, and dispersed ownershi...|$|R
