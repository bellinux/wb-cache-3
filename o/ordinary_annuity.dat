50|$|A {{perpetuity}} is an annuity {{that has}} no end, or a stream of cash payments that continues forever. There are few actual perpetuities in existence (the United Kingdom (UK) government has issued them in the past; these were known as consols and finally redeemed in 2015). Real estate and preferred stock are among some types of investments that affect {{the results of a}} perpetuity, and prices can be established using techniques for valuing a perpetuity. Perpetuities are but one of the time value of money methods for valuing financial assets. Perpetuities are a form of <b>ordinary</b> <b>annuities.</b>|$|R
40|$|The five {{quantities}} {{of interest in}} elementary finance problems are present value, future value, amount of periodic payment, number of periods {{and the rate of}} compound interest per period. A recursive approach to computing each of these five quantities in a modern version of Excel, for the case of <b>ordinary</b> <b>annuities,</b> is described. The aim is to increase student understanding and build confidence in the answer obtained, and this may be achieved with only linear relationships and in cases where student knowledge of algebra is essentially zero. Annuity problems may be solved without use of logarithms and black-box intrinsic functions; these being used only as check mechanisms. The author has had success with the method at Bond University and surrounding high schools in Queensland, Australia. ...|$|R

Some employments {{require a}} much longer time to learn, and a much more {{expensive}} course of instruction, than others; and to this extent there is, as explained by Adam Smith, an inherent reason for their being more highly remunerated. Wages, consequently, must yield, {{over and above the}} <b>ordinary</b> amount, an <b>annuity</b> sufficient to repay these sums, with the common rate of profit, within the number of years [the laborer] can expect to live and be in working condition.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{a certain type}} of polynomial equations for which there exists—according to Descartes’ rule of signs—only one simple positive root. These equations are occurring in Numerical Analysis when calculating or estimating the R-order or Q-order of convergence of certain iterative processes with an error-recursion of special form. On the other hand, these polynomial equations are very common as defining equations for the effective rate of return for certain cashflows like bonds or annuities in finance. The effective rate of interest i∗ for those cashflows is i∗=q∗− 1, where q∗ is the unique positive root of such polynomial. We construct bounds for i∗ for a special problem concerning an <b>ordinary</b> simple <b>annuity</b> which is obtained by changing the conditions of such an annuity with given data applying the German rule (Preisangabeverordnung or short PAngV). Moreover, we {{consider a}} number of results for such polynomial roots in Numerical Analysis showing that by a simple variable transformation we can derive several formulas out of earlier results by applying this transformation. The same is possible in finance in order to generalize results to more complicated cashflows...|$|R
50|$|Analogous to {{continuous}} compounding, {{a continuous}} annuity is an <b>ordinary</b> <b>annuity</b> {{in which the}} payment interval is narrowed indefinitely. A (theoretical) continuous repayment mortgage is a mortgage loan paid {{by means of a}} continuous annuity.|$|E
50|$|If the {{payments}} are {{made at the}} end of the time periods, so that interest is accumulated before the payment, the annuity is called an annuity-immediate, or <b>ordinary</b> <b>annuity.</b> Mortgage payments are annuity-immediate, interest is earned before being paid.|$|E
5000|$|Present {{value of}} an annuity: An annuity {{is a series of}} equal {{payments}} or receipts that occur at evenly spaced intervals. Leases and rental payments are examples.

5000|$|The word arrears {{is used to}} mean [...] "end of period" [...] when {{referring}} to annuities (an annuity is series of equal amounts occurring at equal time intervals, such as £1,000 per month for 20 years). If the recurring amount comes {{at the end of}} each period, the annuity is described as an annuity in arrears or as an <b>ordinary</b> <b>annuity.</b> A loan repayment schedule is usually an annuity in arrears. For example, you borrow £10,000 on September 30 and your first monthly payment will be due on October 31, the second payment will be due on November 30, and so on.|$|E
5000|$|The fixed {{monthly payment}} for a fixed rate {{mortgage}} {{is the amount}} paid by the borrower every month that ensures that the loan is paid off in full with interest {{at the end of}} its term. This monthly payment [...] depends upon the monthly interest rate [...] (expressed as a fraction, not a percentage, i.e., divide the quoted yearly nominal percentage rate by 100 and by 12 to obtain the monthly interest rate), the number of monthly payments [...] called the loan's term, and the amount borrowed [...] known as the loan's principal; rearranging the formula for the present value of an <b>ordinary</b> <b>annuity</b> we get the formula for :For example, for a home loan for $200,000 with a fixed yearly nominal interest rate of 6.5% for 30 years, the principal is , the monthly interest rate is , the number of monthly payments is , the fixed monthly payment [...] This formula is provided using the financial function PMT in a spreadsheet such as Excel.

Complaints include: general illness, unpleasant odor, headaches, and property devaluation. However, state and national law requires all CAFO's to have some form of waste storage facility. These facilities, mainly lagoons, increase the potential of pollution and run-off into streams and other water sources. As a result, large producers are beginning to install anaerobic digestive (A. D.) systems, which are a new form of waste management practices that reduces negative environmental effects. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to determine the future value of an <b>ordinary</b> <b>annuity</b> of an anaerobic digestive system by analyzing the joint probability of being sued and losing a litigation case. The analysis will also factor in potential policy incentives such as 100 % grants with guaranteed electric buy-back premiums to determine a producer's joint probability of losing a litigation case.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} {{a model for}} {{examining}} the demand for annuities together with the possible implications of adverse selection when an individual consumer has access to both a private annuity market and a market with a pooled annuity fund. An earlier paper by Piggott, Valdez, and Detzel (2004) provides a formal analysis of the payout adjustments from a longevity risk-pooling fund, an arrangement {{referred to in the}} paper as Group Self Annuitization (GSA). In such a pooled arrangement, the annuitants will bear their own cohorts ’ system-atic risk, but the cohort will share the idiosyncratic risk. The resulting return on the pooled annuity fund can be expressed as the product of a return from an <b>ordinary</b> <b>annuity</b> multiplied by a random variable that accounts for the adjust-ment that is due to deviations from expectation of mortality and investments. As demonstrated in this paper, a simple analysis of economic choice provides {{that it is possible to}} reduce the implications of adverse selection in a pooled annuity fund, thereby helping to lower the costs of annuity. It is well-documented that empirically, individuals do not find private annuity funds an attractive form of investments despite the potential welfare benefits that can be drawn from an-nuitization. A pooled annuity fund is an alternative to the conventional private annuity fund that can be considered more cost-effective...|$|E
