5|$|Scholars {{have found}} it {{extremely}} difficult to assign one specific, <b>overarching</b> <b>theme</b> to the play. Proposals for a main theme include a discovery by the characters {{that human beings are}} neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead are more or less alike, awaking out of a dream and into reality, the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate. None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found {{it is clear that the}} play is full of several small, thematic elements that intertwine in complex ways. Several of those most often debated by scholars are discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Writers {{have placed}} the story within several {{different}} genres, including science fiction, a subgenre {{of science fiction}} called recursive science fiction, and fantasy. Masters of the Occult author Daniel Cohen noted the book contributed to Hubbard's reception among influential science fiction authors of the 1940s. It is regarded as classic science fiction by The Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography in its entry on Hubbard, {{as well as by}} writer James Gunn, and publications including the Daily News of Los Angeles, and Chicago Sun-Times. Writers have placed Typewriter in the Sky within the Golden Age of Science Fiction. Authors Mike Resnick and Robert J. Sawyer classed the story within the science fiction subgenre recursive science fiction, and writer Gary Westfahl wrote that Hubbard may have been influenced by the 1921 Luigi Pirandello play within the recursive fantasy subgenre, Six Characters in Search of an Author. The book is listed in Fantasy: The 100 Best Books, and Rivals of Weird Tales: 30 Great Fantasy and Horror Stories from the Weird Fiction Pulps placed it among the best quality fantasy writing of the 20th century. Writers characterized the <b>overarching</b> <b>theme</b> within the book as dealing with an individual caught between two different worlds.|$|E

25|$|The <b>overarching</b> <b>theme</b> {{of decay}} reaches its {{conclusion}} in Baker's final story Logopolis, which Bidmead personally wrote. The story is particularly sombre, even grim at times.

It was named Aria due to its placement as the central feature of CityCenter, as arias are focal points in operas.|$|E
25|$|David A. Clines, in his {{influential}} The Themes of the Pentateuch (1978), {{identified the}} <b>overarching</b> <b>theme</b> {{of the five}} books as the partial fulfilment of a promise made by God to the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The promise has three elements: posterity (i.e., descendants– Abraham is told that his descendants will be as innumerable as the stars), divine-human relationship (Israel is to be God's chosen people), and land (the land of Canaan, cursed by Noah immediately after the Deluge).|$|E

25|$|The Secret Societies {{exhibit at}} the Old Depot museum ran from August 14 to November 14 of 2016. The full title of the exhibit was “Secret Societies: The Search for Security, Knowledge and Fellowship in Ottawa and Franklin County.” The exhibit {{explored}} the purposes of various secret societies in Franklin County, although the <b>overarching</b> <b>theme</b> was about Franklin County residents searching for community. Some of the secret societies featured were either secret abolitionist groups, like the Danites created by James Lane, or pro-slavery groups.|$|E
25|$|The <b>overarching</b> <b>theme</b> of {{the book}} is to debunk the notion that Lennon retired from rock for five years, from 1975 until his 1980 {{comeback}} album, Double Fantasy, to live as a househusband and raise the couple's son, Sean. Goldman asserts that in reality Lennon had retreated into a secluded, darkened room watching television all day, every day, leaving domestic servants to tend his son, while Ono was feeding a chronic heroin habit. This theme is also supported in the book , which is based on Lennon's own diaries from the months and weeks leading up to his murder.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} Mahmud IV at Jenné has been {{attributed}} to several causes. Details are sparse on the nature of both armies. The <b>overarching</b> <b>theme</b> in why the battle turned out the way it did revolves around the ability of each side to rally its forces. In few other instances are the effects of imperial collapse {{in the face of a}} changing political and military environment so well demonstrated. The Mali which faced off against the pashalik forces and its native allies was not the grand military of Mansa Musa. In fact, it had reversed back to its pre-imperial structure just at the time when leaps forward in technology and organization were essential to the empire’s survival.|$|E

25|$|Since its inception, NETS has {{delivered}} its signature road safety campaign, Drive Safely Work Week (DSWW), through member companies and state partners. DSWW typically has an <b>overarching</b> <b>theme,</b> with specific topics or learning points delivered each {{day during the}} course of a week in October. As technology has evolved, the mode of delivery for DSWW materials has shifted from printed materials to electronic materials that may be downloaded from the Internet. Over the years, prevention of distracted driving has been a common theme for DSWW. In 2010 and 2011, NETS worked in partnership with the U.S. DOT to offer DSWW campaign materials on distracted driving free of charge, an arrangement that resulted in over 6,000 organizations downloading materials during 2010. One of NETS’s member services is the “Safety in Numbers” fleet safety benchmarking program, which provides international benchmarking services, with both qualitative and quantitative data from large companies representing various industry sectors. As a group, NETS member companies participating in the benchmarking program operate nearly half a million vehicles worldwide, with more than nine billion miles driven annually (Network of Employers for Traffic Safety, unpublished data).|$|E

500|$|Many of Saint-Just's {{legislative}} {{proposals were}} compiled {{after his death}} to form an outline for a communal and egalitarian society – they were published as a single volume, Fragments sur les institutions républicaines. The proposals were far more radical than the constitution of 1793, and identify closely with the legendarily fearsome traditions of ancient Sparta. Many of them are interpreted as proto-socialist precepts: the <b>overarching</b> <b>theme</b> is equality, which Saint-Just at one point summarizes as [...] "Man must be independent... There should be neither rich nor poor." ...|$|E

500|$|The work is {{formally}} titled Variations on an Original Theme; {{the word}} [...] "Enigma" [...] appears {{over the first}} six bars of music, {{which led to the}} familiar version of the title. The enigma is that, although there are fourteen variations on the [...] "original theme", there is another <b>overarching</b> <b>theme,</b> never identified by Elgar, which he said [...] "runs through and over the whole set" [...] but is never heard. Later commentators have observed that although Elgar is today regarded as a characteristically English composer, his orchestral music and this work in particular share much with the Central European tradition typified at the time by the work of Richard Strauss. The Enigma Variations were well received in Germany and Italy, and remain to the present day a worldwide concert staple.|$|E
500|$|Gender is an {{additional}} <b>overarching</b> <b>theme</b> within dictator novels. National portraits in Latin America often insist {{on the importance of}} women (and men) that are healthy, happy, productive, and patriotic, yet many national literary treasures often reflect government rhetoric in the way they code active citizenship as male. Masculinity is an enduring motif in the dictator novel. There is a connection between the pen and the penis in Latin American fiction, but this pattern cannot be explained by machismo aloneit is far more complex. According to Rebecca E. Biron, [...] "where we find violent, misogynistic fantasies of masculinity, we also [...] violent social relations between actual men and women." [...] Many Latin American works [...] "include characters who act out violent fictions of masculinity, and yet their narrative structure provides readers with alternative responses to misogynistic fantasies of masculine identity formation".|$|E
500|$|Featured as an {{antagonist}} {{in various}} Batman comics during the '90s, stories {{based on the}} character were highly thematic, political, and philosophical in tone. [...] The majority of the collected stories ("Anarky in Gotham City", [...] "Anarky: Tomorrow Belongs to Us", [...] "Anarky") {{are influenced by the}} philosophy of anarchism, while the final story ("Metamorphosis") is influenced by Frank R. Wallace. [...] Although anti-statism is the <b>overarching</b> <b>theme</b> of the collection, other concepts are explored. Anarky's characterization was expanded throughout the stories to present him first as a libertarian socialist and anarchist, and in the final story as a vehicle for explorations into atheism, rationalism, and bicameralism. Literary references are also utilized throughout the collected stories to stress the philosophical foundations of the character. The collection also tracks the character's evolution from a petty, street-crime fighting vigilante, to a competent freedom fighter in opposition to powerful forces of evil.|$|E
