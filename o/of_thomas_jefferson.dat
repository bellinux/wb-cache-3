5|$|George Tucker (August 20, 1775 – April 10, 1861) was an American attorney, politician, historian, author, and educator. His {{literary}} works include the first fiction of colonial life in Virginia and another which {{is among the}} nation's earliest science fictions. Tucker also published the first comprehensive biography <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jefferson,</b> {{as well as a}} history of the United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1836, Tucker {{completed}} his manuscript {{of a comprehensive}} biography, The Life <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jefferson,</b> Third President of the United States. He sent his composition to James Madison for his approval, as the latter had assisted in its formation. Tucker included for his sanction a proposed dedication to the recipient. Madison replied with his full approbation and signature on June 26, 1836, just hours before his death the following day.|$|E
5|$|In 1746 Beverley was {{commissioned}} by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, to represent him in an expedition with Peter Jefferson (father <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jefferson)</b> through western Virginia to mark the Fairfax Line of the Northern Neck Proprietary, supervising the work of Jefferson and the other surveyors. The following year, {{he and the other}} participants in the Fairfax Line expedition reconvened at Jefferson's Tuckahoe plantation to draft a map (which became known as the Fry-Jefferson Map) of the Northern Neck Proprietary.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon {{could be}} {{considered}} {{one of the founders of}} modern Germany. After dissolving the Holy Roman Empire, he reduced the number of German states from 300 to less than 50, prior to the German Unification. A byproduct of the French occupation was a strong development in German nationalism. Napoleon also significantly aided the United States when he agreed to sell the territory of Louisiana for 15 million dollars during the presidency <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jefferson.</b> That territory almost doubled the size of the United States, adding the equivalent of 13 states to the Union.|$|E
5|$|Political {{parties had}} {{developed}} in the United States before Kentucky became a state. Because most early Kentuckians were Virginians, they naturally allied with the Democratic-Republicans, the party <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jefferson</b> and James Madison; the latter was a cousin of George Madison, the state's sixth governor. Political victories were {{few and far between}} for Federalists in Kentucky, and none of Kentucky's governors were members of the Federalist Party. Military service was the most important consideration for voters in Kentucky's early gubernatorial elections. John Breathitt, elected Kentucky's eleventh governor in 1832, was the first Kentucky governor not to have served in the military.|$|E
5|$|Higginbotham's {{nomination}} {{was held up}} by Mississippi Senator James Eastland, {{the chairman of the}} Senate Judiciary Committee and a committed segregationist. Eastland delayed the nomination long enough so that, despite being passed by a subcommittee, Higginbotham's nomination lapsed following the death of President Kennedy, and {{the beginning of a new}} congressional term. He was ultimately appointed to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by President Lyndon Johnson as a recess appointment on January 6, 1964, and was confirmed by the Senate later that year. At the time of his appointment, he was 35 years old. Higginbotham became a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, of Yale University, and <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jefferson</b> University.|$|E

5|$|In 1795, Scott {{traveled}} to Philadelphia to help clarify service records {{that would determine}} the final pay {{of the men who}} served under him before returning to his farm in Kentucky. He continued to serve, nominally, as major general of the 2nd militia division of the state militia until 1799. Celebrations of Scott's military heroism were held all over Kentucky, sparking his interest in a political career. With the advent of the First Party System, he declared himself a Democratic-Republican, as did most Kentuckians. In 1800, he was chosen as a presidential elector for his district by a vote of 75 to 44 over Caleb Wallace. Scott and his fellow electors all cast their votes for the ticket <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jefferson</b> and Aaron Burr.|$|E
5|$|John Tyler {{was born}} on March 29, 1790, and like his future running mate William Henry Harrison, he hailed from Charles City County, Virginia and was descended from aristocratic and {{politically}} entrenched families. The Tyler family traced its lineage to colonial Williamsburg in the 17th century. John Tyler Sr., commonly known as Judge Tyler, was a friend and college roommate <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jefferson</b> and served in the Virginia House of Delegates alongside Benjamin Harrison V, father of William. The elder Tyler served four years as Speaker of the House of Delegates before becoming a state court judge. He subsequently served as governor and as a judge on the U.S. District Court at Richmond. His wife, Mary Marot (Armistead), {{was the daughter of}} a prominent plantation owner, Robert Booth Armistead. She died of a stroke when her son John was seven years old.|$|E
5|$|Other {{accounts}} {{describe the}} indictment of 24 men for high treason. Most of the accused had eluded capture, so only ten men stood trial for treason in federal court. Of these, only Philip Wigle and John Mitchell were convicted. Wigle had beaten up a tax collector and burned his house; Mitchell was a simpleton who had been convinced by David Bradford to rob the U.S. mail. Both men were sentenced to death by hanging, but they were pardoned by President Washington. Pennsylvania state courts were more successful in prosecuting lawbreakers, securing numerous convictions for assault and rioting. While violent opposition to the whiskey tax ended, political opposition to the tax continued. Opponents of internal taxes rallied around the candidacy <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jefferson</b> and helped him defeat President John Adams in the election of 1800. By 1802, Congress repealed the distilled spirits excise tax and all other internal Federal taxes. Until the War of 1812, the Federal government would rely solely on import tariffs for revenue, which quickly grew with the Nation's expanding foreign trade.|$|E
