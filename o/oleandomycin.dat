50|$|Public {{interest}} in <b>oleandomycin</b> peaked when Pfizer introduced the combination drug Sigmamycine {{into the market}} in 1956. Sigmamycine was a combination drug of <b>oleandomycin</b> and tetracycline that {{was supported by a}} major marketing campaign. It was in fact claimed that a 2:1 mixture of tetracycline and <b>oleandomycin</b> had a synergistic effect on staphylococci. It was also claimed that the mixture would be effective on organisms that are mostly resistant to tetracycline or <b>oleandomycin</b> alone. Both of these claims were refuted by findings such as those by Lawrence P. Garrod that could find no evidence that such claims were properly substantiated. By the early 1970s, Pfizer’s combination drugs were withdrawn from the market.|$|E

50|$|Streptomyces scabies is a streptomycete {{bacteria}} {{which means}} it forms a mycelium made of hyphae, a growth form more usually associated with fungi. The hyphae of Streptomyces, are much smaller than those of fungi (0.5-2.0 μm) and form a heavily branched mycelium. They are Gram-positive and have {{a high proportion of}} the DNA bases guanine and cytosine (71%) in their genome. The genome of strain 87.22 has been sequenced and it is 10.1 Mbp, encoding 9,107 provisional genes. All Streptomyces genomes sequenced so far are relatively large for bacteria, but the genome of S. scabies is the largest. When cultured on agar the hyphae develop aerial fragments which bear chains of spores, giving the culture a fuzzy appearance. The chains of spores have the appearance of corkscrews and are grey in colour. These chains allow it to be differentiated from other species that are virulent on potatoes. Each chain contains 20 or more spores that are 0.5 by 0.9-1.0 μm, smooth and grey. Bacteria are often distinguished by their ability to grow on media containing different substances, which they either feed on or that inhibit their growth. Defining characteristics of strains of S. scabies are that they grow on the sugar raffinose, are unable to degrade xanthine and when grown on media containing the amino acid tyrosine, they produce the pigment melanin, the same chemical that gives humans their skin colour. This trait is often associated with their ability to cause disease, but it is not always present and is considered a secondary trait. They are killed by 10 IU of the antibiotic penicillin G per ml, 25 μg of <b>oleandomycin</b> per ml, 20 μg of streptomycin per ml, 10 μg of thallous acetate per ml, 0.5 μg of crystal violet per ml, and 1,000 μg of phenol per ml.

40|$|Resistance to <b>oleandomycin</b> in Streptomyces antibioticus, the {{producer}} organism, was studied. The organism was highly resistant in vivo to the antibiotic but sensitive to other macrolides and lincosamides.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{administration}} of macrolide antibiotics on cytochrome P- 450 in liver microsomes of male rats were investigated.

Cytochrome P- 450 -metabolite complex was detected with <b>oleandomycin,</b> troleandomycin, erythromycin and erythromycin estolate, whereas no such effect was observed with rokitamycin, leucomycin and josamycin. The content of uncompleted cytochrome P- 450 in liver microsomes remained unchanged with rokitamycin, leucomycin and josamycin, decreased with troleandomycin and <b>oleandomycin,</b> and increased with erythromycin and erythromycin estolate, indi-cating that <b>oleandomycin,</b> troleandomycin, erythromycin and erythromycin estolate also affect the amounts of other forms of cytochrome P- 450.

40|$|Cell {{extracts}} of Streptomyces antibioticus, an <b>oleandomycin</b> producer, can inactivate <b>oleandomycin</b> in {{the presence}} of UDP-glucose.

This enzyme activity also inactivates other macrolides (rosaramicin, methymycin, and lankamycin) which contain a free 2 '-OH group in a monosaccharide linked to the lactone ring (with the exception of erythromycin), but not those which contain a disaccharide (tylosin, spiramycin, carbomycin, josamycin, niddamycin, and relomycin).
