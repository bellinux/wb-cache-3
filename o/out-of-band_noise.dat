50|$|The rusty bolt {{effect is}} radio {{interference}} due to interactions with dirty connections or corroded parts. It is more properly known as passive intermodulation, and {{can result from}} a variety of different causes such as ferromagnetic conduction metals, or nonlinear microwave absorbers and loads. Corroded materials on antennas, waveguides, or even structural elements, can act as one or more diodes. (Crystal sets, early radio receivers, used the semiconductor properties of natural galena to demodulate the radio signal, and copper oxide was used in power rectifiers.) This gives rise to undesired interference, including the generation of harmonics or intermodulation. Rusty objects that should not be in the signal-path, including antenna structures, can also reradiate radio signals with harmonics and other unwanted signals. As with all <b>out-of-band</b> <b>noise,</b> these spurious emissions can interfere with receivers.|$|E

After training, locations can be bound to interactive functions, such as pause/play song, increase/decrease music volume, speed dial, and menu navigation.|$|E
50|$|Non-Gaussian {{statistics}} arise {{due to the}} nonlinear {{mapping of}} random initial conditions into output states. For example, modulation instability amplifies input noise, which ultimately leads to soliton formation. Also, in systems displaying heavy-tailed statistical properties, random input conditions often enter through a seemingly insignificant, nontrivial, or otherwise-hidden variable. Such is generally the case for optical rogue waves; for example, they can begin from a specific <b>out-of-band</b> <b>noise</b> component, which is usually very weak and unnoticed. Yet, in the output states, these minor input variations can be magnified into large potential swings in key observables. The latter may, therefore, exhibit substantial fluctuations for no readily apparent reason. Thus, the appearance of extreme statistics is often striking {{not only because of}} their counterintuitive probability assignments, but also because they frequently signify a nontrivial or unexpected sensitivity to initial conditions. It {{is important to recognize that}} rogue waves in both optics and hydrodynamics are classical phenomena and, therefore, intrinsically deterministic. However, determinism does not necessarily indicate that it is straightforward or practical to make useful predictions. Optical rogue waves and their statistical properties can be investigated in numerical simulations with the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation, a classical propagation equation that is also used to model supercontinuum generation and, more generally, pulse propagation in optical fiber. In such simulations, a source of input noise is needed to produce the stochastic output variations. Frequently, input phase noise with a power amplitude of one photon per mode is employed, corresponding to shot noise. Yet, noise levels beyond the one-photon-per-mode level are generally more experimentally realistic and often needed.|$|E

30|$|In an SDR-based multi-GNSS receiver, the ADC {{sampling}} rate would be high {{with respect to}} the interesting GNSS signal bandwidth. Actually, in the GNSS application, also receiver architectures where the sampling is done directly for the RF signal have been seriously considered [15]. This becomes possible due to the low spectral dynamic range as the GNSS signal levels are typically below the noise floor. Due to high ADC {{sampling rate}}, digital decimation filtering before the correlation processing is mandatory in such receivers from the implementation complexity point of view. Especially, in FFT-based processing, high sampling rate would lead to excessive FFT length [10, 16].

30|$|The {{purpose of}} the noise-shaping filter is to shape the {{quantization}} noise appropriately in the frequency domain [21]. Ideally, the frequency response of the noise-shaping filter should be a two-step function, which in the in-band frequency range has power δ− 1 and in the out-of-band frequency range has power δ[13]. Thus, if both descriptions are received, one is able to filter out the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>noise</b> and thereby obtain a resulting noise power that is proportional to δ− 1. On the other hand, if only a single description is received, then due to aliasing, the resulting noise power is proportional to δ+δ− 1. Furthermore, fixing the levels as δ and δ− 1, respectively, guarantees that their geometric mean is one, which basically fixes the coding rate while allowing one to trade-off side distortion for central distortion [13].|$|E
