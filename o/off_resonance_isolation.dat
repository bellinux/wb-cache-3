40|$|The {{behavior}} of multiple‐pulse NMR line narrowing experiments in solids {{as a function}} of the frequency offset from resonance is examined experimentally and theoretically. Resolution in the four‐pulse, six‐pulse, and phase‐alternated tetrahedral angle experiments was found to increase on going <b>off</b> <b>resonance.</b> These results are explained using coherent averaging theory. The effective Hamiltonian which determines the width of the spectral line <b>off</b> <b>resonance</b> must be averaged over the motion caused by both the rf pulse Hamiltonian and the resonance offset Hamiltonian. It is assumed that the period of the motion caused by one of these two cyclic Hamiltonians is much shorter than the other so that the averages can be carried out sequentially rather than simultaneously. Two relaxation rates are evident in the four‐pulse experiment on solids, corresponding to relaxation parallel and perpendicular to one of the body diagonals, e. g., the (111) direction, in the coordinate frame appropriate to that experiment. For solids containing a single magnetic nuclear species the two rates appear to be equal on <b>resonance,</b> but <b>off</b> <b>resonance</b> relaxation along the (111) direction is slower than relaxation perpendicular to it. This behavior is explained qualitatively by the fact that average Hamiltonians which do not in general commute with (Ix[*]+[*]Iy[*]+[*]Iz) do commute with this operator when they are further averaged over the motion caused by an offset from resonance. The effective heteronuclear dipole–dipole interaction Hamiltonian commutes with (Ix[*]+[*]Iy[*]+[*]Iz) both on and <b>off</b> <b>resonance,</b> which accounts for the difference in the two relaxation rates independent of resonance offset observed in solids containing more than one magnetic nuclear species...|$|R

40|$|Interference of {{standing}} waves in electromagnetic resonators {{forms the basis}} of many technologies, from telecommunications and spectroscopy to detection of gravitational waves. However, unlike the confinement of light waves in vacuum, the interference of electronic waves in solids is complicated by boundary properties of the crystal, notably leading to electron guiding by atomic-scale potentials at the edges. Understanding the microscopic role of boundaries on coherent wave interference is an unresolved question due {{to the challenge of}} detecting charge flow with submicron resolution. Here we employ Fraunhofer interferometry to achieve real-space imaging of cavity modes in a graphene Fabry-Perot resonator, embedded between two superconductors to form a Josephson junction. By directly visualizing current flow using Fourier methods, our measurements reveal surprising redistribution of current on and <b>off</b> <b>resonance.</b> These findings provide direct evidence of separate interference conditions for edge and bulk currents and reveal the ballistic nature of guided edge states.

40|$|We {{present a}} number of {{analytical}} means {{for the analysis of}} the evolution of an atom clock, emphasizing the role of many-body processes in the population and coherence loss. A master equation with one-body and two-body losses included is presented for a thermal cloud ensemble, suitable for modelling atom clock evolution. Approximate solutions for the coupled rate equations with one-body and two-body losses are obtained for the case of Ramsey free evolution, and their validity is analyzed. An approach is suggested to combine the analytical trap-induced fringe envelope function with a numerically evaluated many-body envelope function. A set of Ramsey and spin echo models is offered with analytical solutions for the off-resonant and on-resonant regimes with one-body population loss and phenomenological dephasing. Their detuning spectra are presented and the difference between them and the standard Ramsey model is shown: the Rabi pedestal in the present model has no spectral ripples due to the pi/ 2 -pulse duration equal to a quarter of a Rabi oscillation, even <b>off</b> <b>resonance,</b> in contrast to the Ramsey method where the pi/ 2 -pulse duration is not corrected <b>off</b> <b>resonance</b> and causes spectral ripples. the off-resonant and on-resonant regimes with one-body population loss and phenomenological dephasing.

An interferometric fringe in long evolution experiments is typically measured with a visibility decay primarily due to phase diffusion, phase instability, trapping effects and many-body losses. It constitutes a problem to extract parameters from a fringe obtained in the time domain because of the growing uncertainty of the fringe amplitude and phase. This visibility loss can be compensated for systems with unequal state population losses, as the one we have, by tailoring the pulse durations. Methods are suggested for the one-body and many-body cases. A comprehensive set of experiments is conducted on the characterization of the stability of the trapped atom clock: with condensate and thermal cloud ensembles, with phase-domain Ramsey and spin echo interferometries, with synchronization from a rubidium frequency standard and from an oven-controlled quartz oscillator. The types of noise present in the system are identified by means of an Allan deviation analysis. Despite the 50 times different cloud densities of the condensate and the thermal clouds, an equality of the phase stability in the Ramsey interferometry with BEC and thermal clouds is demonstrated. The spin echo interferometry has shown a slightly superior stability with the thermal clouds as compared to the BEC...|$|R
