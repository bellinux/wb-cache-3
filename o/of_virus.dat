5|$|Some {{viruses that}} infect Archaea have complex {{structures}} that are unrelated {{to any other}} form <b>of</b> <b>virus,</b> {{with a wide variety}} of unusual shapes, ranging from spindle-shaped structures, to viruses that resemble hooked rods, teardrops or even bottles. Other archaeal viruses resemble the tailed bacteriophages, and can have multiple tail structures.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> uses only one or two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by organisms; such organisms are called vectors. Some viruses that infect animals, {{including}} humans, are also spread by vectors, usually blood-sucking insects. However, direct transmission is more common. Some virus infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, are spread by contaminated food and water, hands and communal objects and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others are airborne (influenza virus). Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are often transmitted by unprotected sex or contaminated hypodermic needles. It is important to know how each different kind <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> is spread to prevent infections and epidemics.|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> in food {{is connected}} with level of contamination of comestible industry materials and also with not observing the rules of self hygiene of the employees, with leads to diffusion <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> diseases ln this paper discussed factors to favourable occurrence and to spreading <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> in environment and alimentary products. Characteristic viruses by physical and chemical factors are presented...|$|R
50|$|These <b>viruses</b> consist <b>of</b> two types, however both {{share the}} fact that {{replication}} is primarily in the cytoplasm, and that replication is not as dependent on the cell cycle as that <b>of</b> DNA <b>viruses.</b> This class <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> {{is also one of}} the most-studied types <b>of</b> <b>viruses,</b> alongside the double-stranded DNA viruses.|$|R
40|$|Viruses {{have been}} {{virtually}} absent from philosophy of biology. In this editorial introduction, we explain why we think viruses are philosophically important. We focus on six issues (the definition <b>of</b> <b>viruses,</b> the individuality and diachronic identity <b>of</b> a <b>virus,</b> {{the possibility to}} classify viruses into species, the question <b>of</b> whether <b>viruses</b> are living, the question <b>of</b> whether <b>viruses</b> are organisms, and finally the biological roles <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> in ecology and evolution), and we show how they relate to classic questions of philosophy of biology and even general philosophy...|$|R
5|$|A {{laboratory}} diagnosis is usually made based on recovery of poliovirus from a stool sample or a swab of the pharynx. Antibodies to poliovirus can be diagnostic, and are generally {{detected in the}} blood of infected patients early in the course of infection. Analysis of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is collected by a lumbar puncture ("spinal tap"), reveals an increased number of white blood cells (primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein level. Detection <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> in the CSF is diagnostic of paralytic polio, but rarely occurs.|$|E
5|$|After {{the virus}} enters the body {{there is a}} period of rapid viral replication, leading to an {{abundance}} <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood. This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.|$|E
5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> and {{have a variety of}} unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.|$|E

The aim of this literature review was to report the roles <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> in periodontal diseases. The roles <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> in periodontal diseases were categorized into the role in disease etiology, role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases, role in diseases progression and role in response to treatment. Clearer understanding <b>of</b> roles <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> in periodontal diseases will facilitate the provision of effective periodontal disease prevention and treatment...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reinvestigate the natures <b>of</b> {{hepatitis}} <b>virus</b> in detail, the author studied the general natures <b>of</b> hepatitis <b>virus</b> {{in comparison with}} ectromelia virus. The results are summarized as follows: 1) Though hepatitis virus and ectromelia <b>virus</b> are <b>of</b> great similarity in their various natures, collective consideration of the heat-resistance, the drug-resistance. the hemoagglutination reaction etc. makes possible the differentiation between these two sorts <b>of</b> <b>viruses.</b> 2) In the serial passage in mice, though the mixed infection <b>of</b> ectromelia <b>virus</b> should be considered, the discrimination between these two sorts <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> is possible by observation of infectious aspects and general natures...|$|R
50|$|The Tymovirales are a newly {{established}} order <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> in the 2009 classification with four families.

5|$|Bacteria can {{be grown}} in the {{laboratory}} on nutrient culture media, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate. Many vaccines to infectious diseases {{can be grown}} in fertilised chicken eggs. Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that takes about {{six months after the}} decision is made as to what strains <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> to include in the new vaccine. A problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available. Cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when {{it may be difficult to}} acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertile eggs.|$|E
5|$|Classification {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the diversity of viruses by naming and grouping them {{on the basis of}} similarities. In 1962, André Lwoff, Robert Horne, and Paul Tournier were the first to develop a means <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> classification, based on the Linnaean hierarchical system. This system bases classification on phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Viruses were grouped according to their shared properties (not those of their hosts) and the type of nucleic acid forming their genomes. Later the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses was formed. However, viruses are not classified on the basis of phylum or class, as their small genome size and high rate of mutation makes it difficult to determine their ancestry beyond order. As such, the Baltimore classification is used to supplement the more traditional hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|During viral replication, the {{integrated}} DNA provirus is transcribed into RNA, {{some of which}} then undergo RNA splicing to produce mature mRNAs. These mRNAs are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where they are translated into the regulatory proteins Tat (which encourages new virus production) and Rev. As the newly produced Rev protein accumulates in the nucleus, it binds to full-length, unspliced copies <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> RNAs and allows them to leave the nucleus. Some of these full-length RNAs function as new copies of the virus genome, while others function as mRNAs that are translated to produce the structural proteins Gag and Env. Gag proteins bind to copies of the virus RNA genome to package them into new virus particles.|$|E
25|$|There {{also is the}} {{potential}} <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> to evolve drug resistance. Some H5N1-infected persons treated with oseltamivir have developed resistant strains <b>of</b> that <b>virus.</b>|$|R
30|$|The article aims {{to clarify}} an {{existing}} misunderstanding by the users of {{fetal bovine serum}} (FBS), who assume that certain countries, like Australia and New Zealand, have fewer cattle disease viruses and pose less risk for the presence <b>of</b> <b>viruses,</b> than do the other FBS producing countries. The article reviews the 2013 information from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), regarding the presence and absence <b>of</b> the 14 <b>viruses</b> <b>of</b> concern for FBS in the cattle populations of the 30 major FBS producing countries of the world. United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and European Union (EU) regulations have identified 8 adventitious viruses and 6 additional <b>viruses</b> <b>of</b> importation concern {{that need to be}} tested for or eliminated in FBS, viruses that can cross the placental barrier from the donor cow to the fetus. A comparison is made regarding the number <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> <b>of</b> concern reported presently in each of the FBS producing countries. The results of the comparison reveal that four Scandinavian countries report the fewest number <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> <b>of</b> concern for FBS (six in total), while Australia and the USA are among the countries reporting the highest numbers <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> <b>of</b> concern for FBS (ten in total). FBS from Australia and the USA has thus no advantage over the other FBS producing countries, regarding the number <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> needed to be tested for and eliminated.|$|R
50|$|Alloherpesviridae is {{a family}} <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> within the order Herpesvirales. This family {{includes}} the species that infect fish and amphibians. Phylogenetic studies have confirmed the validity of this family and suggest {{that it may be}} divided into two clades: one consisting <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> from cyprinid and anguillid hosts and the other <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> from ictalurid, salmonid, acipenserid and ranid hosts. There are currently 12 species in this family, divided among 4 genera. Diseases associated with this family include: channel catfish disease.|$|R
5|$|Envelope: Some species <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> envelop {{themselves}} in a modified form {{of one of the}} cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity.|$|E
5|$|In 2034, {{two years}} after the events of , Public Security Section 9 is {{investigating}} a string of mysterious suicides by refugees from the Siak Republic. Chief Aramaki conducts a raid to arrest the refugee dictator only to find him already dead. In retaliation, a Siak operative plans a terrorist attack with a micromachine virus. Batou is sent to intercept the Siak operative and encounters Kusanagi, who is conducting her own investigation. Before they can apprehend the operative, he dies while attacking them. Kusanagi takes a case <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> ampules and warns Batou {{to stay away from the}} Solid State Society before leaving.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, the {{development}} of antiviral drugs has increased rapidly, mainly driven by the AIDS pandemic. Antiviral drugs are often nucleoside analogues, which are molecules very similar, but not identical to DNA building blocks. When the replication <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> DNA begins, some of these fake building blocks are incorporated. As soon as that happens, replication stops prematurely—the fake building blocks lack the essential features that allow the addition of further building blocks. Thus, DNA production is halted, and the virus can no longer reproduce. Examples of nucleoside analogues are aciclovir for herpes virus infections and lamivudine for HIV and hepatitis B virus infections. Aciclovir {{is one of the}} oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.|$|E

50|$|Sphaerolipoviridae is {{a family}} <b>of</b> {{double-stranded}} DNA <b>viruses</b> that infect thermophilic bacteria and halophilic archea, formally approved by the International Committee on Taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>Viruses</b> in 2015. <b>Viruses</b> <b>of</b> this family have tailless icosahedral virions with an internal lipid membrane located between the protein capsid and the double-stranded DNA genome.

5|$|The RNA genome {{consists}} {{of at least}} seven structural landmarks (LTR, TAR, RRE, PE, SLIP, CRS, and INS), and nine genes (gag, pol, and env, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, vpu, and sometimes a tenth tev, which is a fusion of tat env and rev), encoding 19 proteins. Three of these genes, gag, pol, and env, contain information {{needed to make the}} structural proteins for new virus particles. For example, env codes for a protein called gp160 that is cut in two by a cellular protease to form gp120 and gp41. The six remaining genes, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, and vpu (or vpx in the case of HIV-2), are regulatory genes for proteins that control the ability of HIV to infect cells, produce new copies <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> (replicate), or cause disease.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{symptoms}} {{are similar to}} other viral diseases such as influenza and the common cold: fever of at least , muscle pain, malaise, headache and prostration. As the digestive tract is commonly involved, nausea and vomiting and backache often occur. The prodrome, or preeruptive stage, usually lasts 2–4 days. By days 12–15 the first visible lesions—small reddish spots called enanthem—appear on mucous membranes of the mouth, tongue, palate, and throat, and temperature falls to near normal. These lesions rapidly enlarge and rupture, releasing large amounts <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> into the saliva.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th century was the golden age <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> {{discovery}} and most of the over 2,000 recognised species of animal, plant, and bacterial viruses were discovered during these years. In 1957, equine arterivirus and the cause of Bovine virus diarrhoea (a pestivirus) were discovered. In 1963, the hepatitis B virus was discovered by Baruch Blumberg, and in 1965, Howard Temin described the first retrovirus. Reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that retroviruses use to make DNA copies of their RNA, was first described in 1970, independently by Howard Martin Temin and David Baltimore. In 1983 Luc Montagnier's team at the Pasteur Institute in France, first isolated the retrovirus now called HIV. In 1989 Michael Houghton's team at Chiron Corporation discovered Hepatitis C.|$|E

5|$|Transduction of {{bacterial}} genes by bacteriophage {{is a consequence}} of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> particles. Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system, is determined by plasmid genes that encode the machinery necessary to transfer a new copy of the plasmid DNA from one bacterial host to another. It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium.|$|E
5|$|Viral {{epidemiology}} is {{the branch}} of medical science that deals with the transmission and control <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> infections in humans. Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means from person to person. Examples of vertical transmission include hepatitis B virus and HIV, where the baby is born already infected with the virus. Another, more rare, example is the varicella zoster virus, which, although causing relatively mild infections in humans, can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{spread in}} many ways. Just as many viruses are very {{specific}} {{as to which}} host species or tissue they attack, each species <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as vectors. Some viruses of animals, including humans, are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as influenza are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as norovirus are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. Rotavirus is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the Dengue virus, are spread by blood-sucking insects.|$|E
