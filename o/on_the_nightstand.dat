5000|$|... "Do {{you write}} with a {{fountain}} pen?" [...] is an inevitable question one gets at readings and such public appearances. The {{assumption is that}} if only one picked the right tool, one could do that! ... But to get {{that out of the}} way, I write on a computer (an ancient Mac Performa I'm about to replace) and correct drafts with a fountain pen (Pelikan, Mont Blanc, Cross, Waterman, Parker, Sheaffer - I have a pleasing array of them). I wake sometime between seven and nine, depending on how late I was up reading the night before. I pour my coffee and bring it to the computer in the small study that was originally a dressing room. I turn on the CD player (at the moment, the Shostakovich preludes and fugues are playing), check the email, reply to whatever's urgent, play a few games of solitaire, and then get to what I'm working on. There is almost always a longish project to which I can repair for entertainment and occupation. But I will put that aside, whatever it is, if a poem presents itself to me. ... I write until noon and then have a light lunch. The mail usually comes in around midday, and I'll look through that. I may read a little (in connection with some project or other, or in search of one, or just for entertainment) or look at newspapers or magazines (the usual ones, but The Georgia Review, Pequod, and Shenandoah are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nightstand</b> at the moment). If the work has been going well, I may put in another hour in the afternoon. Or I will run errands and shop. Or cook, which is pleasant to do after a session with words because it's physical and tactile, and the payoff is immediate. I generally exercise for half an hour (on a stationary bicycle, usually watching Inside Politics on CNN, which is the best — or least bad — thing on then). My wife gets home around 6:30 PM, and inasmuch as the main purpose of writing is to get through the day until drinks-time, I can pop a cork and declare the day a success.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{intelligent}} interactive nightstand {{mounted on a}} mobile robot, to aid the elderly in their homes using physical, tactile and visual percepts.

A camera mounted on {{the ceiling of the}} room, gives a top-down view of the obstacles, the person and the nightstand. Pressure sensors mounted beneath the bed-stand of the individual provide physical perception of the person's state.

5000|$|The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle {{gave the}} episode a [...] "C-" [...] grade and wrote, [...] "'Rogues' Gallery,' much like Gotham as a whole, {{suffers from a}} {{baffling}} identity crisis, as evidenced in the episode's opening moments. In the span {{of just a few}} minutes, we're re-introduced to all the relevant storylines via a montage. We see Jim Gordon on guard at Arkham Asylum as <b>the</b> inmates put <b>on</b> an incompetent production of Shakespeare. We see Harvey Bullock quietly pondering his life, or perhaps his next fedora purchase, while drinking from a flask. We see Selina Kyle peering out into the rain, also pondering, and Barbara sleeping next to Montoya, bottles of pills strewn about <b>the</b> <b>nightstand.</b> Establishing where these characters are isn't a misguided move, but the execution is off and indicative of what plagues this show as a whole. One minute we're meant to be laughing at the crazy Asylum patients and their strange rendition of Shakespeare, and the next we're meant to be contemplating the seriousness of the situation Gordon has got himself into, and how widespread corruption has corroded the city of Gotham and allowed good guys like Gordon to be buried. There's a frustrating imbalance here, all in the first few minutes. It's jarring to go from a comical stage play to an investigation into amateur shock therapy, followed shortly by an exploration of deeply-felt insecurity in romantic relationships. Gotham wants to be too many things at once, and it’s to the detriment of narrative precision and intrigue." ...|$|R

It opens to a clock ticking counting down, and flashing quick glimpses of other scenes, some {{from the rest of}} the video, including the main character escaping down a hallway, screaming at the camera and counting calendar days in vivid red lighting, as well as numerous images of a similarly lit flower. These brief images repeat throughout the video. Shots of <b>the</b> band performing <b>on</b> a large indoor stage with bright, dynamic lighting are spliced throughout between the story scenes. Two scientists are shown discussing design plans for a female android posted on a wall in their workplace. A woman sleeps in a bed with a monitor on her wrist and an electronic device placed around her head, with several doctors monitoring her through the glass wall, watching what appears to be a simulation being created for her through <b>the</b> device <b>on</b> a screen, and tapping a button marked [...] "days to reset" [...] on another as it counts down and cycles through the days of the week. The woman's sleep appears to be getting less restful from the simulation as she fidgets and begins breathing harder. She is shown walking out onto a rooftop and taking a transparent rake from one of the men escorting her, redrawing the lines in a large sand garden, and looking out at the city around them before she and two of the men go back inside. We see her in the same room and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same bed as before, but without the electronic devices, leaning away from an unknown man with a somewhat frightened expression as he lifts her chin to look at him and then begins undressing himself. Shots are shown of her flipping through a journal with a loose note stuck into it, reading [...] "you are stronger than you think." [...] She goes up to the rooftop to draw in the sand again, only this time bumps into an exact duplicate of herself accompanied by two different men, as both women take a moment to stare at each other in shock. She is later seen laying in bed, again without the devices, appearing to contemplate the emotions of these recent encounters. She is then shown looking through the glass wall of a small room, filled with sixteen more of the duplicates, standing but deactivated. She places a new note in the journal atop the other, reading [...] "look right. You are stronger in numbers." [...] <b>On</b> <b>the</b> last day before the reset, the version of her with the simulation device suddenly startles awake, tears off the device and snaps it in half before throwing a stack of books from <b>the</b> <b>nightstand</b> through <b>the</b> window and escaping. We see her weave through numerous people trying to catch her, the source of some of the shots spread through the rest of the video, before she locks herself in a small room, containing a [...] "final reset" [...] button which she presses. She steps up onto a platform that lays her on her back as she appears to deactivate, before we see every one of the sixteen other duplicates wake up.|$|R

40|$|As William L. Stull and Maureen P. Carroll {{predicted}} in 2006, {{the publication of}} Beginners in 2009 has caused a great change in Raymond Carver studies. The {{purpose of this study}} is to participate in the change, examining Beginners’ version of“ Why Don’t You Dance?”. Over the past few decades, a considerable number of studies have been conducted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> analysis of the edited version of the story. What seems to be lacking is careful textual examination. This study concentrates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first paragraph of the story. In order to present a new reading of the text, the study introduces the concept of intertextuality. The study discusses two images in the first paragraph; the one is“ stripped candy-striped sheets”, and <b>the</b> other is“ <b>nightstand</b> and reading lamp”. Both of them are examined in detail by rubbing together with other texts. In analyzing former expression, I refer to The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger and“ The Flag” by Ernest Howard Crosby. In analyzing latter expression, I pay attention to“ Cat in the Rain” by Ernest Hemingway. By introducing the concept of intertexuality, new reading with texual and biographical evidences will be possible. Also, I emphasize the importance of a definite and an indefinite article in the text. Now that we can trace Carver’s biography in detail owing to Raymond Carver by Carol Sklenicka, intertexual reading should be done thoroughly and this study intends to be an example of such reading...|$|R
40|$|History {{of present}} illness: A 46 -year-old male {{presented}} to the emergency department (ED) with severe left eye pain and decreased vision after tripping and striking {{the left side of}} his head <b>on</b> <b>the</b> corner of his wooden <b>nightstand.</b> <b>The</b> patient arrived as an inter-facility transfer for a suspected globe rupture with a protective eye covering in place; thus, further physical examination of the eye was not performed by the emergency physician in order to avoid further leakage of aqueous humor. Significant findings: The patient’s computed tomography (CT) head demonstrated a deformed left globe, concerning for ruptured globe. The patient had hyperdense material in the posterior segment (see green arrow), consistent with vitreous hemorrhage. CT findings that are consistent with globe rupture may include a collapsed globe, intraocular air, or foreign bodies. Discussion: A globe rupture is a full-thickness defect in the cornea, sclera, or both. 1 It is an ophthalmologic emergency. Globe ruptures are almost always secondary to direct perforation via a penetrating mechanism; however, it can occur due to blunt injury if the force generated creates sufficient intraocular pressure to tear the sclera. 2 Globes most commonly rupture at the insertions of the intraocular muscles or at the limbus. They are associated with a high rate of concomitant orbital floor fractures. 2, 3 Possible physical examination findings include a shallow anterior chamber on slit-lamp exam, hyphema, and an irregular “teardrop” pupil. Additionally, a positive Seidel sign, which is performed by instilling fluorescein in the eye and then examining for a dark stream of aqueous humor, is indicative of a globe rupture. 4 CT is often used to assess for globe rupture; finds of a foreign body, intraocular air, abnormal contour or volume of the globe, or disruption of the sclera suggest globe rupture. 2 The sensitivity of CT scan for diagnosis of globe rupture is only 75...|$|R
