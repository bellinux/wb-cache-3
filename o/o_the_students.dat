The program began on September 30, 1992. The program has enabled UCLA to use its strong existing background to train students in technological problems which simultaneously are {{of interest to the}} industry and of specific interest to PG and E. The program included undergraduate scholarships, graduate traineeships and distinguished lecturers. Four topics were selected for research the first year, with the benefit of active collaboration with personnel from PG and E. These topics remained the same during the second year of this program. During the third year, two topics ended with the departure <b>o</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> involved (reflux cooling in a PWR during a shutdown and erosion/corrosion of carbon steel piping). Two new topics (long-term risk and fuel relocation within the reactor vessel) were added; hence, the topics during the third year award were the following: reflux condensation and the effect of non-condensable gases; erosion/corrosion of carbon steel piping; use of artificial intelligence in severe accident diagnosis for PWRs (diagnosis of plant status during a PWR station blackout scenario); the influence on risk of organization and management quality; considerations of long term risk from the disposal of hazardous wastes; and a probabilistic treatment of fuel motion and fuel relocation within the reactor vessel during a severe core damage accident...|$|E

40|$|Interest {{activities}} (hereinafter {{referred to}} as IA) {{are an important part}} of the elementary school, since children may choose one (or more) of the offered interest activities to discover and develop their strong areas of interests and abilities. This is especially important for those children who have learning difficulties and in the regular classroom activities only do not experience the desired success. The central purpose of the thesis was to deal with and analyse the integration of children with special educational needs into schools in the interest activities. On the basis of the theoretical starting points and objectives of the research issues we have used a semi-structured interview. The study involved 83 children: 42 children without special needs from elementary schools in Brezovica and 41 children with special educational needs that are included in regular programs of different primary schools (Elementary school Log-Dragomer, Elementary school Ivan Korošec, Elementary school Brezovica) and Subsidiary school Bevke. We were interested in <b>the</b> differences between <b>students</b> and students with special needs: the integration into the IA, the number and type of the selected IA, motives for engaging in IA, proposals for new IA, the availability of IA and the reasons for not participating in the IA. We were also interested if the kind of the disorder had any impact on the integration in the IA. We found out that most of <b>the</b> <b>students</b> with special needs who were involved in an IA, chose one IA, the rest mostly chose two; students with physical sensory deficits (hereinafter {{referred to as}} the PSD) tended to choose one IA, students with hidden deficits (hereinafter referred to as <b>the</b> HD), two. <b>Students</b> with special needs choose mostly sports activities, they do not favourize social science IA. Among pupils with PSD the most popular activities are language, technical and creative IA. Most <b>os</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> with HD choose a sport for their IA. Almost all of <b>the</b> <b>students</b> were involved in the IA due to their own interests. <b>The</b> <b>students</b> that were not involved in any of the IA stated, that the reson for their not involving was their disinterest or engagement in activities outside the school. Most of the pupils with special needs do not show similar interests in the activities of free time and IA. Children with hiden deficits are more often engaged in different activities and IA than those with PSD. Students believe that IA are accessible to all students. Children with special needs mostly choose their IA themselves; they also want more sports activities. The same wish was expressed also by students with PSD. Children with hidden deficits are mostly satisfied with the current offer, or have no ideas for a new IA. The results show that among children with special needs and other children there are no statistically significant differences. The type of disorder does not affect participation in IA. ...|$|R

40|$|Ankara : Institute of Economics and Social Sciences, Bilkent Univ., 1998. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 1998. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 75 - 80 In recent years, reading {{has been}} {{considered to be a}} critical skill, especially in academic oriented classes for which students have to do extensive reading to pursue their studies successfully. The major interest in reading comprehension has become reading strategies due to the research evidence which reveals that successful readers differ from the less successful ones mainly in their stra. tegic approach towards the text they are reading. Therefore, helping readers employ effective strategies is considered to be an essential component of reading classes. This study aimed at identifying the cognitive reading strategies that <b>the</b> freshman <b>students</b> at Hacettepe University need to develop in order to continue their academic studies successfully. The assumption was that <b>the</b> <b>students</b> lack <b>the</b> necessary cognitive strategies which can direct them towards becoming better readers. In testing this assumption, questionnaires, checklists and Think-Aloud Protocols (TAPS) were used as data collection instruments. The questionnaires and TAPs were administered to freshman students in order to collect data on their strategy use. The checklists were administered to the instructors of the Department of Basic English with the purpose of investigating the relationship between cognitive strategy use of <b>the</b> <b>students</b> and <b>the</b> training they get in employing those strategies. For each item in the questionnaires and checklists, frequencies and percentages were determined. In the analysis of the TAPs, transcriptions of student verbalizations were coded to identify the cognitive strategies that were employed during the TAPs. Similarly, frequencies and percentages were calculated for these strategies. A comparison was made to see whether the self reported data about the strategy use is consistent with the strategy use during the actual reading. A further comparison was made between the results of questionnaires, TAPs and the checklists to understand whether <b>the</b> strategy use <b>o</b> f <b>the</b> <b>students</b> reflect <b>the</b> training they get. Findings of the study suggest that freshman students at Hacettepe University lack certain cognitive reading strategies which are believed to be essential in making sense of the written material. According to the results of the study, the strategies that <b>the</b> freshman <b>students</b> need to develop are reading the first line of each paragraph to get the gist, guessing <b>the</b> meaning <b>o</b> f a word by considering its grammatical category, avoiding word-for-word translation, visualization, note-taking, assimilating background knowledge with the text, classifying word according to their meanings and grammatical categories, summarizing and rereading to remember important information.
