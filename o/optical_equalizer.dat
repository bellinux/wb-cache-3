40|$|Fibre optics is {{the best}} way of {{communication}} ever found. It has huge bandwidth's capability often considered as unlimited. We can not use the full potential of fibre optics because there are lots of disturbance appearing at the output of an optical link. Lengths of the fibre and the type of fibre, multimode or single mode, are parameters that change attenuations. To counter these attenuations algorithms has been developed. Recently, a new type of modulation, part of the Partial Response family, has been used in fibre optics. Despite improvements by using this new modulation form we have not use the full potential of these communication systems yet.

40|$|As the {{backbone}} {{for the global}} communication network, optical dense wavelength division multiplexed (DWDM) systems are facing challenges in capacity, flexibility, reliability and cost effectiveness. In my thesis research I developed five novel optical devices or subsystems to combat these technical challenges. Each of these devices/subsystems is described in an individual chapter including background survey, proposal of new features, theoretical analysis, hardware design, prototype fabrication and characterization, and experimental verification in DWDM systems. The first is a novel tunable asymmetric interleaver that allows the interleaving ratio to be adjusted dynamically. Two design methods were proposed and implemented. Spectral usage optimisation and overall system performance improvement in 10 G/ 40 G and 40 G/ 100 G systems were successfully demonstrated through simulations and experiments. The second is a colourless intra-channel <b>optical</b> <b>equalizer.</b> It is a passive periodic filter that restores the overall filter passband to a raised cosine profile to suppress the filter narrowing effect and mitigate the inter-symbol interference. 20 % passband widening and 40 % eye opening were experimentally achieved. The third is a flexible band tunable filter that allows simultaneous tuning of centre frequency and passband width. Based mainly on this filter, a low cost expendable reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexer (ROADM) node was developed. Its flexible switching features were experimentally demonstrated in a two-ring four-node network testbed. The fourth is a transponder aggregator subsystem for colourless and directionless multi-degree ROADM node. Using the unique characteristics of the coherent receiver, this technology eliminates the requirement of wavelength selector, thus reduces power consumption, size and cost. I experimentally demonstrated that it can achieve < 0. 5 dB penalty between receiving single channel and 96 channels. The last is a real-time feedforward all-order polarization mode dispersion (PMD) compensator. It first analyses spectral interference pattern to retrieve phase information and calculate PMD, then it uses a pulse shaper to restore the pulse shape and thus compensates the PMD. These functions were demonstrated through experiments and simulations. All of these novel devices and subsystems deliver new functional features and are suitable to be applied {{in the next generation}} DWDM systems to improve capacity, flexibility, and reliability and to reduce cost...|$|E

40|$|The {{march of}} optics into {{telecommunications}} transmission: There {{is nothing new}} about optical communications. The 'beacon hills' all over the UK once communicated from London to Paris by visual signals. The use of electricity to develop telephone networks moved attention to that technology for a time. But optics is now capable of delivering far better performance at lower costs than coaxial cables. For instance, one fibre strand is capable of carrying at least 1500 digital TV channels while a bandwidth about as high as 3 TeraHertz (THz) might be available. Traditionally, an optical communications system worked by sending a light from a source via an electrical modulator down a length of fibre. At the receiving end, the signal goes through a demultiplexor and out again to the next section of fibre via a repeater amplifier. Electronic amplifiers were needed about every 100 km or so because of signal attenuation, and since these are slow, the full potential of the 3 THz can't be exploited. All this changed in the mid- 1980 s {{with the appearance of}} optical-fibre amplifiers, such as the Erbium-Doped Fibre Amplifier (EDFA). These devices take input signals which may come from 10, 000 km away and perform enormous amplification, but without the reshaping and retiming of pulses as happened with electrical amplifiers. With the resultant 'optical transparency', any form of signal can go through a global network without cross-talk. This allows, for example, for analogue working in some channels and digital operations in others. Signal dispersion remains a major problem on the global network. Dispersion first emerged as a major transmission issue with the laying of the first transatlantic cable in 1866, when dispersion caused such bad signal smearing that it was first thought the cable was broken. The problem was eventually solved by using coil equalisers along the cable's length. Modern dispersion problems are exacerbated because optical amplifiers work at a wavelength of 1. 55 microns, whereas the installed network was designed to operate at 1. 3 microns. This limits the transmission span to about 60 km at 10 Gbt/s. To overcome the problem, we have a choice of either developing a viable 1. 3 microns amplifier, if that is possible, or developing dispersion-compensation techniques for the EDFA approach. There are a number of ways in which such compensation can be achieved, such as the <b>optical</b> <b>equalizer</b> device a couple of centimetres long developed at our Southampton Centre. Once such compensation techniques become widely available, optical systems will be able to deliver the telecommunications dream of something like 3 THz operation with signal transparency and no dispersion. No other information transmission medium can match this. The impact and potential of optical systems: A few years ago, a BT experiment showed that optical amplifiers could enable a single video server to distribute sixteen 2. 488 Gbps per channel to nearly 44 million subscribers over a distance of 527 km. This could reach just about everyone in the UK. And an experiment by NTT of 160 Gbps transmission over 62 km suggested that it would be feasible one day to push the equivalent of the total maximum communications traffic in the USA down one fibre. To gauge what all this means, consider the complete American Library of Congress, which consists of about 25 terabits of information. It would take around 4, 000 years to send this by fax to Japan; ten hours by 10 Gbps optical fibre; and only a minute if the full capacity of optical fibre technology is exploited. We will need to give a lot of careful thought to what we do with this growing abundance of transmission space created by optical systems. In addition, optical fibre technology is revolutionising the telecommunications industry. For example, optical networks are seriously questioning the need for satellite communications. They have also cut the cost of transmissions {{to the point that it}} now costs a telecoms company about the same to handle a call from Leeds to New York as from Leeds to Manchester, despite the different rates charged to customers. It is also interesting to observe the enormous integration in the market of entertainment media and telecommunications activities, such as the way cable TV companies are now also becoming telecom operators. Ultra-fast optical switching in processors consumes a great deal of power and introduces a large pipeline delay, so in my view we are not going to see general-purpose optical computing. But we are already seeing telecommunications multiplexors with optical-signal routing, because a pipeline delay doesn't matter when a signal is coming from thousands of miles away. Some people have also been looking at single- mode fibres which can produce ultra short picosecond pulses far better than you can do with electronics. However, a fibre of over 6 km is now needed as a picosecond of optical demultiplexor, incurring a pipeline delay of 5 microseconds per kilometre. Optics is far behind silicon when it comes to integration, although the first steps in this direction are underway. One such device which will be a vital aid for distributing signals from 'fibre to the kerb' to many homes in an area is an 'optical splitter' that divides a signal by a hundred and amplifies it at the same time. Eventually, optics could follow the example of silicon in going from discrete components to more integration. In the next 25 years we are likely to see growing use of optical amplifiers, faster pulse generation and transmission and more all-optical switching and routing. Such routing capabilities could allow a subscriber to choose the destination of a signal, rather than relying on a switch operation by a telecommunications company. There will also be more and more active optical circuits and sensors on a chip and more use of optics inside computers and in inter-chip operations...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the design and}} characterisation of a compact <b>optical</b> power <b>equalizer</b> module for <b>optical</b> fiber telecommunication applications. The various components of the modules are separately examined {{in terms of their}} impact on the overall dimension, performance and loss of the equalizer module. Two components are studied in greater details, namely the micro diffractive optical elements (DOEs), responsible for the multiplexing/demultiplexing of the wavelength channels, and the micromirrors, responsible for creating the beam displacements and thus controlling the attenuation. The DOEs allow for the spatial separation of 64 wavelengths into a two-dimensional array with a compact module. MUMPs surface-micromachined micromirrors have good optical properties: 0. 29 dB (93. 5 %) reflectance, low surface sag and negligible curvature. At operating voltages of less than 15 V, tilts of 16 mrad are obtained, sufficient to provide over 50 dB attenuation for the equalizer. Simulation results show that the diffractive elements have low efficiency due to fabrication limitations. The power loss due to beam clipping is 2. 81 dB with overall system efficiency at above 5 dB. Major areas of improvement in the device packaging, assembly and efficiency have been identified for future works...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Optical fiber {{is capable}} of {{providing}} {{the solution to the}} need of high bandwidth communication. The main degradation to the optical signal integrity in single mode fibers (SMFs) is chromatic dispersion (CD). The effect of CD is pulse spreading which in turn leads to inter-symbol interference (ISI), thus increasing the bit error rate (BER) of the system. This paper presents a CD compensation technique that utilizes a parallel optical all pass filter (p-OAPF), where the design is based on the inverse phase response of the SMF. The p-OAPF is based on a class of all-pass filter. Simulation results of the proposed technique show an increase in the repeater-less length of a point-to-point optical communication system by 3 times with Gaussian pulses at 10 Gb/s and BER of 10 - 9. A passive infinite impulse response filter structure is proposed for the implementation of the p-OAPF.

40|$|Abstract—An {{adaptive}} polarization-mode dispersion (PMD) {{compensation system}} has been developed to cancel the effects of first-order PMD by producing a complementary PMD vector in the receiver. Control parameters for the PMD compensation system comprised of a polarization controller and a PMD emulator are derived from the nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) signal in the channel to be compensated. Estimates of the link’s differential group delay (DGD) and principal states of polarization (PSP’s) based on this signal are reliable when the signal power is equally split between the link’s two PSP’s; however this condition cannot be assumed. To meet this requirement, we scramble the state of polarization (SOP) of the input signal at a rate {{much greater than the}} response time of the PMD monitor signal so that each sample represents many different SOP alignments. This approach allows the effective cancellation of the first-order PMD effects within an optical fiber channel.

40|$|Abstract—We {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) receiver {{in the presence of}} the impairments from both the pulse carver-data modulator timing misalignment (TM) and polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in optically amplified return-to-zero (RZ) systems. RZ modulation format is commonly used in long-haul wavelength-division multiplexing transmission systems and the dominating noise source in those systems is amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise, which is signal dependent and requires special study when direct detection is employed. In this paper, based on the bit-to-bit error probability estimation using Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion and decorrelation of noise components, we use the steepest descent method to obtain sequence-to-sequence error probability and achieve the performance evaluation of MLSE receiver with arbitrary input signal pulse shape, optical filtering and electrical filtering taken into consideration. Monte Carlo simulations of a 10 -Gb/s RZ system are demonstrated and agree with the theory well. The results show that the power penalty induced by TM and PMD can be effectively reduced by MLSE receiver, which thus validates its capability to enhance tolerance to both TM and PMD with shared electrical devices.

The implementation of Dense-Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) optical fiber transmission systems has the potential to meet this demand. However, crucial components of DWDM networks – add/drop multiplexers, filters, gain equalizers as well as interconnects between optical channels – are currently not implemented as dynamically reconfigurable devices.

40|$|The {{research}} work {{described in this}} thesis focuses on the design, implementation and measurement of an analog ultra-high speed Semicondutor <b>Optical</b> Ampliffier (SOA) <b>equalizer.</b> These activities are {{carried out in the}} framework of Erasmus+ internship program. Introducing optical switching technology, it has a prospective of offering exibility, power efficiency, providing large capacity and fast response. In this thesis, the resolution of monitoring and equalization of the power for these fast optical switches is studied. Not controlling the optical power, consecutive packets may suffer large variations in the signal power level. In an optical packet switching scenario, the dynamic performance of the packets duration is so short that analog circuit has to respond with enough speed to equalize the packets in this range of time. A fast optical switch usually use semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) as switching gates, so their utility to equalize power variation of the packets becomes increasingly attractive due to its fast nano-scale response and adjustable optical gain. The analog equalizer has to provide the correct bias current to an in-line SOA for an equal- ization of the packets in a specific sub-micron time response. This is accomplished by studying the mathematical concept of equalization up to fully design an analog circuit. Simulation of each stage as well as the whole circuit performance has been employed, showing promising results in the dynamics of the circuit, 100 ns response time. Moreover, the design of a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layout to integrate different prototypes has also been exploited, where two prototypes has been presented: fixed-slope configuration (High-Speed Equalizer v 1. 0) and full- exible configura- tion (High-Speed Equalizer 2. 0).

40|$|The {{demand for}} optical power {{splitters}} is growing globally, {{due to the}} rapid deployment of fibre-to-the-premises, optical metropolitan area network (MAN), and active optical cables for TV/Video signal transport. Optical splitters {{play an important role}} in passive optical network (PON) technology by enabling several hundred users to share one optical line terminal. However, current PONs, which use fixed optical power splitters, have limited reconfigurability particularly in adding/dropping users to/from an optical network unit. An adaptive optical power splitter (OPS) can dynamically reallocate the opticalpower in the entire network according to the real-time distribution of users and services, thus providing numerous advantages such as improve an optical network efficiency, scalability, and reliability. An adaptive OPS is also important for realizing self-healing ring-to-ring optical MAN, thus offering automatic communication recovery when line break occurs. In addition, future optical line protection systems will require adaptive optical splitters to switch optical signals from faulty lines to active power lines, avoid the use of optical attenuators and/or amplifiers, and achieve real time line monitoring. An adaptive OPS can also be incorporated in tunable optical dispersion compensators, optical attenuator and <b>optical</b> gain <b>equalizer,</b> and reconfigurable <b>optical</b> switches. This thesis proposes and demonstrates the principle of a novel Opto-VLSI-based adaptive optical splitter/combiner for next generation dynamic optical telecommunication networks. The proposed splitter structure enables an input optical power to be split adaptively into a larger number of output fibre ports, through optimized phase holograms driving the Opto-VLSI processor. The new adaptive optical splitter has additional advantages including lossless operation, adequate inter-port crosstalk, compressed hardware and simple user interface. This thesis demonstrates, in particular, the concept of an adaptive optical power splitter employing an Opto-VLSI processor and a 4 -f imaging system experimentally in three stages as follow: (i) a 1 × 2 adaptive optical power splitter based on an Opto-VLSI processor, a fibre collimator array and 4 -f imaging systems (single lens), (ii) a 1 × 4 adaptive optical power splitter based on an Opto-VLSI processor, a fibre array and 4 -f imaging systems (single lens), and (iii) a 1 ×N lossless adaptive optical power splitter structure integrating an Opto-VLSI processor, optical amplifiers, a fibre array, and an array of 4 -f imaging systems (lens array). The thesis also demonstrates the concept of an adaptive optical signal combiner which enables multiple signals to be combined with user-defined weight profiles into a single fibre port. Experimental results demonstrate that an input optical signal can arbitrarily be split into N signals and coupled into optical fibre ports by uploading optimized multicasting phase holograms onto the Opto-VLSI processor. They also demonstrate that N input optical signals can be dynamically combined with arbitrary weights into a single optical fibre port. Excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental results is demonstrated. The total insertion loss of the optical power splitter is only 5 dB. Results also show that the optical amplifiers can compensate for the insertion and splitting losses, thus enabling lossless splitter operation. A crosstalk level around - 25 dB and a wavelength spectral range exceeding 40 nm is experimentally realized. In addition, a novel broadband adaptive RF power splitter/combiner based on Opto-VLSI processor is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. By uploading optimized multicasting phase holograms onto the software-driven Opto-VLSI processor, the input RF signal is dynamically split and directed to different output ports, with userdefined splitting ratios. Also, multiple input RF signals can be dynamically combined with arbitrary user-defined weights. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, two input RF signals are dynamically combined with different user-defined weight profiles. We also propose and demonstrate a photonic microwave filter based on the use of an Opto-VLSI-based adaptive optical combiner. The experimental results demonstrate that the developed Opto-VLSI-based adaptive optical combiner can dynamically route multiple input optical signals to a single output, with user-defined weight profiles, thus realising a tunable microwave filter. Overall this Opto-VLSI-based adaptive optical power splitter should allow as many as 32 output ports to be supported while achieving high splitting resolution and dynamic range. This will greatly enhance the efficiency of optical communication networks...|$|R
