40|$|Application of {{the robots}} in {{industrial}} production processes, {{year after year}} is increased. The constant growth of the robot application is related for its functional justification.

Their use is still {{the largest in the}} manufacturing of motor vehicles industry but other industry branches record increase of industrial robot implementation. Information technology development has a big influence on changes in robotics that lead to the new functional solutions and the robot capabilities.

The Joint <b>Operational</b> <b>Stock</b> (JOS) is a centrally-located inventory of Special-Operations- peculiar weapons and equipment, {{managed by the}} United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).

This method has not always provided convincing justification for finding, {{as indicated by the}} loss of such finding in fiscal year 1999. Also, new technology and other items not historically demanded must be handled in an ad-hoc fashion. We introduce a procurement planning tool that seeks to maximize the ability to completely loadout special operations missions by coordinating year-by-year procurement of individual items. Rather than focus just on history, we concentrate on supporting future missions over an entire multi-year planning horizon.

40|$|Many {{international}} {{investors have}} realized that they cannot obtain profits as large, investing in mature markets as well as investing in emerging and developing countries. They want to obtain higher yields, of course assuming the extra risk, as the risk of liquidity or volatility of exchange rates, which are significantly higher than in developed markets. Studies on the BRICS economies are countless, researchers pointing {{that the development of}} these economies and their transition towards developed economies category is virtually inevitable (Nistor, 2011). In this article we propose a smooth approach {{on the state of the}} economies of the BRICS emerging countries and the stock exchanges markets. It is interesting to observe how, according to a forecast of the International Monetary Fund, in the year 2025 world supremacy from the economic point of view will belong still to the United States, but the discrepancies between the United States economy and China's economy subside until then. The same source, however, predict that by the year 2050, China's economy will bring forward the United States of America. However, should not be lost of sight the fact that China is part of the BRICS countries, with enormous development potential. As proof of those exposed earlier, sits the performance obtained from China's economy especially in times of crisis, when the vast majority of the world's economies recorded negative economic growth. Somewhat improperly said so, we were witnessing a world economic depression. The performance of China's economy is so, noteworthy, it received even in the toughest years of global financial and economic crisis, a positive value of economic growth. This also happened, within other BRICS emerging countries economies, having many similar economic meanings. With such a potential for economic growth, the economies of BRICS countries have brought into the spot light the <b>operational</b> <b>stock</b> exchanges. The interest of investors for investments in BRICS countries financial markets has increased considerably, mostly because they offer higher yields than the mature financial markets, of course with a slightly higher risk assumed...|$|E

Although couched in technical language, the report made it abundantly clear that Canada had been publicly proclaiming a commitment to an operational task that it had little capacity to fulfill. [...] General Gérard Thériault, a major proponent of forces integration and the then-current Chief of the Defence Staff, stated that Canadian defence policy would be well served by consolidating their commitments in Europe. Thériault's replacement, General Paul Manson, started a review that suggested a number of changes to the CAST organization, but these were eventually ignored.|$|R
