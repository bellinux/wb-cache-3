5000|$|GNI {{is defined}} in {{accordance}} with the European system of national and regional accounts. GNI represents total <b>primary</b> <b>income</b> receivable by resident institutional units: compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, property income (interest, dividends and reinvested earnings from foreign direct investment receivable less payable), gross operating surplus and gross mixed income. It corresponds to the better known gross domestic product (GDP) minus <b>primary</b> <b>income</b> payable by resident units to non-resident units, plus <b>primary</b> <b>income</b> receivable by resident units {{from the rest of the}} world. Technically speaking, the GNI is a balancing item of the allocation of <b>primary</b> <b>income</b> account in the sequence of accounts for the total economy. Loosely speaking, it is the sum of domestic and foreign income earned by the resident population of a country. It is worth noting that GNI is income from productive activities excluding any capital gains and losses (also known as [...] "holding gains and losses") resulting from price changes of fixed or financial assets (for example: price changes on the stock market have no direct impact on GNI).|$|R

Allocation of <b>primary</b> <b>income</b> account -This account {{shows the}} {{resident}} units and institutional sectors as recipients rather than producers of <b>primary</b> <b>income.</b> It demonstrates {{the extent to}} which operating surpluses are distributed (for example by dividends) to the owners of the enterprises. Also recorded in this account is the property income received by an owner of a financial asset in return for providing funds to, or putting a tangible non-produced asset at the disposal of, another unit. The receipt by government of taxes on production less subsidies is shown in resources.The resources side of this account includes the components of the income approach to measuring gross domestic product and is the starting point for the quarterly sector accounts. The accounts also include property income recorded as both resources for receipts and uses for payments.The balance of this account is the gross balance of <b>primary</b> <b>income</b> for each sector. If the gross balance of <b>primary</b> <b>income</b> is aggregated across all sectors of the UK economy, the result is gross national income.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{thesis of}} {{cognitive}} capitalism {{leads to a}} radical reform {{of the distribution of}} wealth. A Basic <b>Primary</b> <b>Income</b> (BPI) scheme is the keystone of such reform. This paper shows that the justification of a BPI can also be founded on a re-examination of the notion of productive labor linked to the rise of the cognitive dimension of labour. This conception of basic <b>income</b> as <b>primary</b> <b>income</b> completes ethical and social justifications of BI. Our argumentation is structured in two fully interconnected parts. After an overview of cognitive capitalism, the first part is dedicated to the main foundations of our proposal of basic <b>primary</b> <b>income</b> (BPI). The second part concerns the articulation between our proposal for BPI and the modalities of funding one. We explain how the question of funding BPI is closely linked to its theoretical justifications...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the productivity of}} the Spanish economy {{in relation to the}} five major European economies and also the allocation of <b>primary</b> <b>income</b> between capital and labor factors. The evolution of productivity in the Spanish economy is weak compared to the European context.

We conclude that labor income in the Spanish economy have not benefited from economic growth in the ten years prior to the 2008 crisis. In addition, Spain is the country among the big five European economies in which the contraction of national income associated with the crisis has been the most related to a drop in the compensation of employees. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{was to investigate the}} clinicopathological characteristics and the prognosis of prostate cancer patients affected by <b>other</b> <b>primary</b> malignancies. Materials and Methods: From 1990 to 2008, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1, 317 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer. We assessed the effect of <b>other</b> <b>primary</b> malignancies on clinicopathological fea-tures, biochemical recurrence (BCR) -free survival, cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Results: Of 1, 317 patients, at least one additional <b>other</b> <b>primary</b> malignancy was de-tected in 187 patients (14. 2 %). A comparison of patient groups according to {{the presence or absence of}} <b>other</b> <b>primary</b> malignancies showed no significant differences in pre-operative serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations, pathological Gleason scores, or pathological staging. Prostate cancer patients with <b>other</b> <b>primary</b> malignancies were older than patients without <b>other</b> <b>primary</b> malignancies (p＜ 0. 001).

Coffee produces a similar high profit margin, allowing establishments to include coffee in free refill offers.Most of these establishments have fast customer turnover, thus customers rarely consume enough beverage to make the offering unprofitable.
