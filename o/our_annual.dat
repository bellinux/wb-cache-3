500|$|In 1976 a {{friendly}} at Aston Villa was abandoned owing to hooliganism. This included Rangers fans attacking a pub {{that had been}} bombed by the IRA three years prior, which drew particular criticism from the Orange Order in newspapers. The Orange Order stated [...] "How many of us saw the cruel irony in {{the fate of the}} Tavern on the Town public house – the one bombed three years ago by the IRA – smashed and devastated by the crazed minds who sang Orange songs. Let us be perfectly blunt. The same examples of low animal life who force their support on Glasgow Rangers {{are one and the same}} with the foul-mouthed drunks who cause us great embarrassment every July when they turn up to 'support' <b>our</b> <b>annual</b> rallies". In response, the Rangers manager Willie Waddell declared an intent to change the media perception of Rangers being a sectarian club. While he denied the existence of the signing policy, he stated that [...] "no religious barriers will be put up at this club regarding signing of players" [...] and pledged to remove supporters from Ibrox Stadium who did not accept it. Despite this, no Catholic players were signed by Rangers following it.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{intermittent}} success, Florida {{had never}} been considered a consistent national power. [...] This changed in 1990, when former quarterback Steve Spurrier left Duke and returned to Gainesville as the Gators' [...] "head ball coach." [...] Since his return, the Gators rank among the three Division I (FBS) programs with the most wins. Spurrier is credited with changing SEC football. He used a pass-oriented offense (known in the media as [...] "fun 'n' gun"), {{in contrast with the}} ball-control, rush-oriented offense traditionally played in the conference. Spurrier's Gators won four consecutive SEC championships (1993–1996), and he once said when the Gators posed for their championship photo: [...] "This is <b>our</b> <b>annual</b> team picture." ...|$|E

2500|$|Craig Murray, the British {{ambassador}} to Uzbekistan from 2002 to 2004, {{wrote that the}} executive director of Freedom House told him in 2003 that the group decided to back off from its efforts to spotlight human rights abuses in Uzbekistan, because some Republican board members (in Murray's words) [...] "expressed concern that Freedom House was failing to keep in sight the need to promote freedom in the widest sense, by giving full support to U.S. and coalition forces". Human rights abuses in Uzbekistan at the time included the killing of prisoners [...] by [...] "immersion in boiling liquid," [...] and by strapping on a gas mask and blocking the filters, Murray reported. Jennifer Windsor, {{the executive director of}} Freedom House in 2003, replied that Murray's [...] "characterization of our conversation is an inexplicable misrepresentation not only of what was said at that meeting, but of Freedom House's record in Uzbekistan ... Freedom House has been a consistent and harsh critic of the human rights situation in Uzbekistan, as clearly demonstrated in press releases and in <b>our</b> <b>annual</b> assessments of that country".|$|E

60|$|You {{perceive}} {{that the principal}} resistance {{they have to make}} is to that spurious beauty, whose attractiveness had tempted men to forget, or to despise, the more noble quality of sincerity: and in order at once to put them beyond the power of temptation from this beauty, they are, as a body, characterized by a total absence of sensibility to the ordinary and popular forms of artistic gracefulness; while, to all that still lower kind of prettiness, which regulates the disposition of our scenes upon the stage, and which appears in our lower art, as in <b>our</b> <b>annuals,</b> <b>our</b> commonplace portraits, and statuary, the Pre-Raphaelites are not only dead, but they regard it with a contempt and aversion approaching to disgust. This character is absolutely necessary to them in the present time; but it, of course, occasionally renders their work comparatively unpleasing. As the school becomes less aggressive, and more authoritative--which it will do--they will enlist into their ranks men who will work, mainly, upon their principles, and yet embrace more of those characters which are generally attractive, and this great ground of offense will be removed.|$|R
