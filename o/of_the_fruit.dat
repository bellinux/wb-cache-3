5|$|This species {{appears to}} have been confounded with C.distans; and from Lightfoot's {{description}} of the green angles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fruit,</b> I presume it to have been what he intended under that name. It is considerably larger than the real distans, the spikes black intermixed with green rather than yellowish, and the female ones often branched or compounded at their base. Its most essential and decisive character however consists in the two strong deep-green nerves or ribs which run along each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fruit</b> externally near the edge.

Chitin, hemicellulose, and pectin-like carbohydrates—all indigestible by humans—contribute to the nutritionally desirable high proportion of insoluble fibre in B.edulis.|$|E
