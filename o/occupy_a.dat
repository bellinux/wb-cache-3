5|$|After storms, the Beagle reached Montevideo on 26 July 1832, {{and took}} {{observations}} for the chronometers.

5|$|By the mid-15th century, Magna Carta {{ceased to}} <b>occupy</b> <b>a</b> {{central role in}} English {{political}} life, as monarchs reasserted authority and powers which had been challenged in the 100 years after Edward I's reign. The Great Charter remained a text for lawyers, particularly as a protector of property rights, and became more widely read than ever as printed versions circulated and levels of literacy increased.|$|E

5|$|Chemical {{bonds between}} atoms were now explained, by Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1916, as the {{interactions}} between their constituent electrons. As the chemical properties of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law, in 1919 the American chemist Irving Langmuir suggested {{that this could be}} explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to <b>occupy</b> <b>a</b> set of electron shells about the nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Ole Bull State Park {{is located}} in the Kettle Creek watershed. It opened in 1925. The Susquehannock State Forest {{is located in}} Potter County, near the creek's headwaters.

Tioga State Forest and Elk State Forest also <b>occupy</b> <b>a</b> small part of the watershed, on the northeastern and edges, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Rainforests {{are areas}} of the world with very high rainfall. Both {{tropical}} and temperate rainforests exist.

5|$|The {{division}} now {{was ordered}} to <b>occupy</b> <b>a</b> front some 50km wide, divided into three subsectors: Eastern, from Akritas to Tavoulari, held by the 192nd Regiment, minus its Foot Battalion which remained at the Krousia sector; Central, at the Metamorfosi heights, to be occupied by the two companies sent from Thessaloniki; and Western, at the Batsova heights, {{taken over by the}} 11th Border Sector (two infantry companies). The remainder of the division remained in the Krousia area.|$|E
5|$|The proton, the electron, and {{the neutron}} are {{classified}} as fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle which prohibits identical fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum state at the same time. Thus, every proton in the nucleus must <b>occupy</b> <b>a</b> quantum state different from all other protons, and {{the same applies to}} all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud. However, a proton and a neutron are allowed to occupy the same quantum state.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm petrel}} is sexually mature at age 4–5 years, with the Mediterranean {{subspecies}} typically breeding {{a year earlier}} than the Atlantic form. Breeding happens in colonies and normally begins in late May or June. Pairs have a repeated nocturnal display flight in which the male chases the female, the chase being accompanied by flight calls. Some near-adult birds may pair up and <b>occupy</b> <b>a</b> hole at the same time, prior to breeding in the following year.|$|E

5|$|White dwarfs {{have low}} {{luminosity}} and therefore <b>occupy</b> <b>a</b> strip {{at the bottom}} of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, a graph of stellar luminosity versus color (or temperature). They should not be confused with low-luminosity objects at the low-mass end of the main sequence, such as the hydrogen-fusing red dwarfs, whose cores are supported in part by thermal pressure, or the even lower-temperature brown dwarfs.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, {{and only a}} few large islands, such as Greenland, Iceland, parts of Polynesia and the Hawaiian Islands lack native ant species. Ants <b>occupy</b> <b>a</b> wide range of {{ecological}} niches and exploit many different food resources as direct or indirect herbivores, predators and scavengers. Most ant species are omnivorous generalists, but a few are specialist feeders. Their ecological dominance is demonstrated by their biomass: ants are estimated to contribute 15–20% (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) of terrestrial animal biomass, exceeding that of the vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Birds <b>occupy</b> <b>a</b> {{wide range}} of {{ecological}} positions. While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the niches occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the forest canopy, others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor. Forest birds may be insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or kleptoparasitism. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers. Avivores are animals that are specialised at preying on birds.|$|E
