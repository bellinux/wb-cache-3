5|$|Flex-fuel hybrid {{electric}} and flex-fuel plug-in hybrid {{are two types}} of hybrid vehicles built with a combustion engine capable of running <b>on</b> <b>gasoline,</b> E-85, or E-100 to help drive the wheels in conjunction with the electric engine or to recharge the battery pack that powers the electric engine. In 2007 Ford produced 20 demonstration Escape Hybrid E85s for real-world testing in fleets in the U.S. Also as a demonstration project, Ford delivered in 2008 the first flexible-fuel plug-in hybrid SUV to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), a Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid, which runs <b>on</b> <b>gasoline</b> or E85. GM announced that the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, launched in the U.S. in late 2010, would be the first commercially available flex-fuel plug-in capable of adapting the propulsion to several world markets such as the U.S., Brazil or Sweden, as the combustion engine can be adapted to run on E85, E100 or diesel respectively. The Volt was initially expected to be flex-fuel-capable in 2013. Lotus Engineering unveiled the Lotus CityCar at the 2010 Paris Motor Show. The CityCar is a plug-in hybrid concept car designed for flex-fuel operation on ethanol, or methanol as well as regular gasoline.|$|E
5|$|As governor, Ford raised {{revenue from}} a {{severance}} tax on coal, a two-cent-per-gallon tax <b>on</b> <b>gasoline,</b> {{and an increased}} corporate tax. He balanced these increases by exempting food from the state sales tax. The resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction projects. His victory in the primary had been largely due to Jefferson County, and he returned the favor by approving funds to build the Commonwealth Convention Center and expand the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center. He also shepherded a package of reforms to the state's criminal justice system through the first legislative session of his term.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{took control of}} deciding how much the prices should rise in a year, {{as long as the}} subsidy cuts <b>on</b> <b>gasoline</b> and other refined products, natural gas, electricity, water, food (sugar, rice, cooking oil and bread), health and education are between $10 and 20 billion dollars annually. Estimates indicate that the government has to increase existing prices by an average of 2.5 times to achieve the lower target and by 4 times for the maximum target. According to the IMF, Iranians can expect the first price hike to lift energy product prices between four and 20 times previous levels, with prices surging even higher eventually.|$|E

5|$|Evins {{incorporated}} Cracker Barrel in February 1970, {{and soon}} opened more locations. In the early 1970s, the firm leased land <b>on</b> <b>gasoline</b> station sites near interstate highways to build restaurants. These early locations all featured gas pumps on-site; during gasoline shortages {{in the mid}} to late 1970s, the firm began to build restaurants without pumps. Into the early 1980s, the company reduced the number of gas stations on-site, eventually phasing them out altogether as the company focused on its restaurant and gift sales revenues. Cracker Barrel became a publicly traded company in 1981 to raise funds for further expansion. It floated {{more than half a million}} shares, raising $4.6 million. Following the initial public offering, Cracker Barrel grew at a rate of around 20percent per year; by 1987, the company had become a chain of more than 50 units in eight states, with annual net sales of almost $81 million.|$|E

25|$|In 2009 the Japanese {{government}} {{implemented a}} set of policies and incentives that included a scrappage program, tax breaks on hybrid vehicles and other low emission cars and trucks, and a higher levy <b>on</b> <b>gasoline</b> that raised prices {{in the order of}} USD 4.50 per gallon. New hybrid car sales for 2009 were almost triple those for 2008.|$|E
25|$|Currently, many {{countries}} set limits <b>on</b> <b>gasoline</b> aromatics in general, benzene in particular, and olefin (alkene) content. Such regulations led to increasing preference for high octane pure paraffin (alkane) components, such as alkylate, and is forcing refineries to add processing units to reduce benzene content.

25|$|According to the 2010 NRC study, {{although}} a mile driven on electricity is cheaper than one driven <b>on</b> <b>gasoline,</b> lifetime fuel savings {{are not enough}} to offset plug-ins high upfront costs, {{and it will take}} decades before the break even point is achieved. Furthermore, {{hundreds of billions of dollars}} in government subsidies and incentives are likely to be required to achieve a rapid plug-in market penetration in the U.S.|$|E

In most of mainland Europe, sales tax is lower on diesel fuel than <b>on</b> <b>gasoline,</b> and diesel is accordingly the cheaper fuel: in the UK and Switzerland, diesel has no tax advantage and retails {{at a higher}} price by quantity than gasoline (offset by its higher energy yield).|$|E
25|$|A {{claim that}} the Progress party is populist dates back to a motion of no {{confidence}} in 1986 for the Conservative Party Prime Minister KÃ¥re Willoch. During the parliamentary election campaign in 1985, the Progress Party had promised not to contribute to a socialist government. After the Conservative-led government proposed to increase taxes <b>on</b> <b>gasoline</b> however, Hagen pulled his support for the government, which {{led to the formation of}} a Labour Party-government.|$|E

25|$|The Honda Civic GX {{was for a}} {{long time}} the only {{purpose-built}} natural gas vehicle (NGV) commercially available {{in some parts of the}} U.S. The Honda Civic GX first appeared in 1998 as a factory-modified Civic LX that had been designed to run exclusively on compressed natural gas. The car looks and drives just like a contemporary Honda Civic LX, but does not run <b>on</b> <b>gasoline.</b> In 2001, the Civic GX was rated the cleanest-burning internal combustion engine in the world by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).|$|E
25|$|A further {{strengthening}} of the effort came from the Joint Oil Targets Committee set up in London to supervise the oil campaign more scientifically.

One of its first decisions was to recommend intensification of attacks <b>on</b> <b>gasoline</b> production, thus giving highest priority to the synthetic oil plants and to crude oil refineries in Romania, Hungary, Poland, and Germany, in that order.|$|E
