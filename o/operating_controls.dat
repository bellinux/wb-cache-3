25|$|Two night fighter sub-variants of the F6F-3 were developed: the 18 F6F-3E's were {{converted}} from standard-3s and featured the AN/APS-4 radar in a pod {{mounted on a}} rack beneath the right wing, with a small radar-scope fitted {{in the middle of}} the main instrument panel and radar <b>operating</b> <b>controls</b> installed on the port side of the cockpit. The later F6F-3N, first flown in July 1943, was fitted with the AN/APS-6 radar in the fuselage, with the antenna dish in a bulbous fairing mounted on the leading-edge of the outer right wing; approximately 200 F6F-3Ns were built. Hellcat night fighters claimed their first victories in November 1943. A total of 4,402 F6F-3s were built through until April 1944, when production was changed to the F6F-5.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{exiting the}} elevator, guests enter a hallway within the secret MIB Headquarters. Traveling down the hall, {{they pass the}} film's famous [...] "worm guys" [...] on break, several {{interactive}} doors to various labs, and through the alien scanners. [...] At {{the end of the}} hallway, guests overlook the immigration and controls room, with a large video screen broadcasting the training information and alien twins, Bob and Bhnxaxx <b>operating</b> <b>controls.</b> They then move into the weapons room, and finally into the training facility, where a training vehicle awaits. Guests who use an Express Pass skip some rooms and meet the normal riders when they see the alien twins in the control rooms, then follow the normal riders but in a different path.|$|E

50|$|This {{style of}} reactor can be {{designed}} to be inherently safe. As it heats, the graphite expands, separating the fuel and reducing the reactor's criticality. This property can simplify the <b>operating</b> <b>controls</b> to a single valve throttling the turbine. When closed, the reactor heats, but produces less power. When open, the reactor cools, but becomes more critical and produces more power.|$|E
50|$|The P320 was {{designed}} to be ambidextrous in handling, sporting an ambidextrous slide catch lever and user reversible magazine catch. All other <b>operating</b> <b>controls</b> are designed so they can be operated from either side. The firearm can be field stripped with no tools. Additionally, the firearm can also be field stripped without depressing the trigger, an additional safety feature to prevent negligent discharge of the weapon.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the reasons}} the pistol grip style is so common in {{machinery}} is because it is possible to ergonomically position the <b>operating</b> <b>controls.</b> For example, on the AR-15 and M16 rifle, a right-handed user's index finger can control the trigger and magazine release, while the thumb can control the safety or fire mode selector switch, all without needing to remove the palm from the grip.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{asymmetric}} {{design of}} many locomotives, turntables {{still in use}} are more common in North America than in Europe, where locomotive design favors configurations with a controller cabin on both ends or in the middle.

50|$|The Roger Williams was a streamlined, six car, lightweight, DMU {{passenger}} train, {{built by}} the Budd Company in 1956 for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The train was based on Budd's successful RDC DMU cars. The end two cars were equipped with streamlined locomotive style cabs and noses, resembling those on the Fairbanks-Morse P-12-42 Diesel locomotives.

50|$|Most S70 {{vehicles}} are double-ended, with <b>operating</b> <b>controls</b> {{at both ends}} and doors on both sides. An exception is the 40 cars in service on Portland's MAX system, which are single-ended and have cabs at only one end of each car. However, they have doors {{on both sides and}} in service they always operate in pairs, coupled back-to-back, so that each consist has operating cabs at both ends.|$|E
