5|$|Reviewing {{the book}}, Charles E. Osgood {{classified}} {{the book as}} a graduate-level text based more on objective facts than on theoretical constructs. He thought the book was verbose on some topics and too brief on others {{not directly related to}} the author's expertise area. He was also critical of Miller's use of simple, Skinnerian single-stage stimulus-response learning to explain human language acquisition and use. This approach, per Osgood, made it impossible to analyze the concept <b>of</b> <b>meaning,</b> <b>and</b> the idea of language consisting of representational signs. He did find the book objective in its emphasis on facts over theory, and depicting clearly application of information theory to psychology.|$|E
5|$|Ripostes, {{published}} in October 1912, begins Pound's shift toward minimalist language. Michael Alexander describes the poems as showing a greater concentration <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> economy of rhythm than his earlier work. It was published when Pound {{had just begun}} his move toward Imagism; his first {{use of the word}} Imagiste appears in his prefatory note to the volume. The collection includes five poems by Hulme and a translation of the 8th-century Old English poem The Seafarer, although not a literal translation. It upset scholars, as would Pound's other translations from Latin, Italian, French and Chinese, either because of errors or because he lacked familiarity with the cultural context. Alexander writes that in some circles, Pound's translations made him more unpopular than the treason charge, and the reaction to The Seafarer was a rehearsal for the negative response to Homage to Sextus Propertius in 1919. His translation from the Italian of Sonnets and ballate of Guido Cavalcanti was also {{published in}} 1912.|$|E

25|$|Ultimately, Pask found {{versatile}} learners neither favor {{one approach}} over the other. Rather, they understand how both approaches are {{integrated into the}} structure of learning. The similarities of conversation theory and text and conversation theory are they both focus on the foundational aspects of meaning. Specifically, how and why meaning is established and interpreted amongst individuals. However, {{the difference between the}} two theories is conversation theory specifically focuses on the dynamics of two people. Text and conversation theory is typically applied to at least two people. Conversation theory emphasizes the construct of knowledge <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> the cause and effect relationship that occurs as a result of self-learning from communication, based on meaning.|$|E
25|$|Jung's {{theory of}} {{neurosis}} {{is based on}} the premise of a self-regulating psyche composed of tensions between opposing attitudes of the ego and the unconscious. A neurosis is a significant unresolved tension between these contending attitudes. Each neurosis is unique, and different things work in different cases, so no therapeutic method can be arbitrarily applied. Nevertheless, there is a set of cases that Jung especially addressed. Although adjusted well enough to everyday life, the individual has lost a fulfilling sense <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> purpose, and has no living religious belief to which to turn. There seems to be no readily apparent way to set matters right. In these cases, Jung turned to ongoing symbolic communication from the unconscious in the form of dreams and visions.|$|E
25|$|The {{culture of}} Taiwan is {{a blend of}} Confucianist Han Chinese and Taiwanese aborigines cultures, which are often {{perceived}} in both traditional and modern understandings.

In recent years, the concept of Taiwanese multiculturalism has been proposed as a relatively apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture as collectively held systems <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> customary patterns of thought and behavior shared by the people of Taiwan.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of personal coping strategies (including self-management or self-help) {{is said to}} be an important element. This can involve making use of medication or psychotherapy if the consumer is fully informed and listened to, including about adverse effects and about which methods fit with the consumer's life and their journey of recovery. Developing coping and problem solving skills to manage individual traits and problem issues (which {{may or may not be}} seen as symptoms of mental disorder) may require a person becoming their own expert, in order to identify key stress points and possible crisis points, and to understand and develop personal ways of responding and coping. Developing a sense <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> overall purpose {{is said to be}} important for sustaining the recovery process. This may involve recovering or developing a social or work role. It may also involve renewing, finding or developing a guiding philosophy, religion, politics or culture. From a postmodern perspective, this can be seen as developing a narrative.|$|E
25|$|The {{status of}} Taiwanese culture is debated. It is disputed whether Taiwanese {{culture is a}} {{regional}} form of Chinese culture or a distinct culture.

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{religion}} is a social construct, since in other eras, religion, culture, and even national identity were often inseparable. And as for spirituality, {{this is an old}} concept with a new usage. Previous to today’s era, what people today call spirituality was often called piety. Professor of Theology, Linda Mercadante sees religion as a complex adaptive network of myths, symbols, rituals and concepts that simultaneously figure patterns of feeling, thinking, and acting and disrupt stable structures <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> purpose. When understood in that way, religion not only involves ideas and practices that are manifestly religious but also includes a broad range of cultural phenomena not ordinarily associated with religion. Many people use spirituality to refer to their interior life of faith and religion to mean the necessary communal and/or organizational part. Mercadante sees both spirituality and religion as consisting of four basic components: beliefs, desire, rituals, and behavioural expectations, but across the field of Religious Studies the definitions vary. When Mercadante has spoken with SBNRs, they take a decidedly anti-dogmatic stance against religious belief in general. They claim not only that belief is non-essential, but that it is potentially harmful or at least a hindrance to spirituality.|$|E
25|$|Others such as Francis Collins, Kenneth R. Miller, George Coyne and Francisco J. Ayala {{argue for}} {{compatibility}} {{since they do}} not agree that science is incompatible with religion and vice versa. They argue that science provides many opportunities to look for and find God in nature and {{to reflect on their}} beliefs. According to Kenneth Miller, he disagrees with Jerry Coyne's assessment and argues that since significant portions of scientists are religious and the proportion of Americans believing in evolution is much higher, it implies that both are indeed compatible. Elsewhere, Miller has argued that when scientists make claims on science and theism or atheism, they are not arguing scientifically at all and are stepping beyond the scope of science into discourses <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> purpose. What he finds particularly odd and unjustified is in how atheists often come to invoke scientific authority on their non-scientific philosophical conclusions like there being no point or no meaning to the universe as the only viable option when the scientific method and science never have had any way of addressing questions of meaning or God in the first place. Furthermore, he notes that since evolution made the brain and since the brain can handle both religion and science, there is no natural incompatibility between the concepts at the biological level.|$|E
30|$|These {{findings}} further reinforce social constructivist {{connections between}} social interactions <b>and</b> <b>meaning</b> making in university learning. While {{social media use}} in general remains relatively constant across participants, when examining specific ways <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> making <b>and</b> specific social media use in university learning, several key relationships become evident. As shown through the Pearson correlation, {{there is a significant}} relationship between ways <b>of</b> making <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> specific SMT use, demonstrating not only the connections between <b>meaning</b> making <b>and</b> SMTs, but also that these contexts are important for social media in university learning. There are also connections between particular ways <b>of</b> making <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> several specific social media, as outlined in the supporting data provided in Tables  6, 7, and 8.|$|R
