5|$|A new {{aristocracy}} {{known as}} the Kazoku was established. It merged the ancient court nobility of the Heian period, the Kuge, and the former Daimyo, feudal lords subordinate to the Shogun. It also established the Imperial Diet, consisting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives and the House of Peers. Members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Peers were {{made up of the}} Imperial Family, the Kazoku, and those nominated by the Emperor, while members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives were elected by direct male suffrage. Despite clear distinctions between powers of the executive branch and the Emperor in the Meiji Constitution, ambiguity and contradictions in the Constitution eventually led to a political crisis. It also devalued the notion of civilian control over the military, which meant that the military could develop and exercise a great influence on politics.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> fan <b>house</b> {{is located}} south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> headframe. It mostly {{consists}} of a large cylindrical, steel fan housing mounted on concrete plinths. <b>The</b> eastern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> is flared and open; a large multi- bladed fan is visible inside.

5|$|Due to {{successive}} remodelings and enlargements {{the architecture}} at Ashton Court {{is complex and}} seldom what it seems. The core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> a 15th-century manor, has been obliterated by later wings, which have in turn been remodelled and altered, most substantially around 1635. Therefore, the plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> has evolved as irregular with many juxtapositions and little cohesion; while the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> {{was built in the}} 17th century, a time of classical architecture, remodelling and alteration to the fenestration has created an overall Gothic appearance.|$|E
5|$|Further major {{additions}} {{were made}} to the building by Sir John Hugh Smyth (1734–1802). He inherited the estate in 1783 and added the new library to the north west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Sir John also asked the famous landscape designer Humphry Repton for advice about the east front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Repton drafted a plan but Sir John's death halted any further work on the house. However Repton's landscape designs were implemented by Sir John's successor Sir Hugh Smyth. In his book Humphry Repton gave {{a detailed description of the}} old and newer parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> before the library additions and included a drawing of the eastern front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> as he saw it in about 1790.|$|E

In the late 18th century, under the ownership of James Townsend, the narrow east facade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> was remodelled into an entrance front, and given the appearance of a typical Georgian house. At the same time, the south front's gabled attics were removed, giving the house's southern elevation its current appearance.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest in <b>the</b> improvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> stock. Parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> stock in Dutch cities do not meet <b>the</b> modern preferences <b>of</b> urban households and do not have sufficient housing quality. Improving this, demolition followed by new construction and renovation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> stock is necessary. The current instruments are not appropriate to improve <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> stock. Consumers and local authorities lack insight into housing quality and building regulations seem to be a barrier for <b>the</b> improvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> stock. Solutions for these problems may be found in a proposal made by <b>the</b> Dutch Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Housing.</b> <b>The</b> proposed building file describes <b>the</b> quality condition <b>of</b> buildings and functions as a maintenance manual. It could support homeowners in fulfilling their responsibility for <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> their dwellings and local authorities to develop quality policy.
