On 21 February 1918, he took up his balloon busting again, downing a gas bag. By {{the time he left}} Jasta 13 at the end of April, he was a double ace. His six victories over balloons made him an ace on them alone.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{launched}} their last great offensive in December, {{resulting in the}} Battle of the Bulge. In an attempt to repeat their 1940 success, German forces were launched through the Ardennes. Again they encountered weak forces holding the front, as the American formations there were either new to the war or exhausted units <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> sector of the front rehabilitating. There were however also some important differences to 1940 {{which resulted in the}} German offensive ultimately failing. They were facing enormously strong Allied airpower unlike in 1940 when they had ruled the skies. The opening of the offensive was timed for a spell of bad weather, aimed at removing the threat of the Allied airpower, but the weather cleared again relatively soon.|$|E
500|$|He joined Luftwaffe on 7 November 1938, as a Fahnenjunker (officer candidate) and {{received}} his military basic training in Quedlinburg in the Harz region. On 1 March 1939 Marseille {{was transferred to}} the Luftkriegsschule 4 (LKS 4—air war school) near Fürstenfeldbruck. Among his classmates was Werner Schröer. Schröer reports that Marseille was often in breach of military discipline. Consequently, Marseille was ordered to stay on base while his classmates were on weekend leave. Quite frequently Marseille ignored this and left Schröer a note: [...] "Went out! Please take my chores." [...] On one occasion, while performing a slow circuit, Marseille broke away and performed an imaginary weaving dogfight. He was reprimanded by his commanding officer, Hauptmann Mueller-Rohrmoser, and taken off flying duties and his promotion to Gefreiter postponed. Soon after, during a cross-country flight, he landed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> stretch of Autobahn (between Magdeburg and Braunschweig) and ran behind a tree to relieve himself. Some farmers came to enquire if he needed assistance, but by the time they arrived Marseille was on his way, and they were blown back by his slipstream. Infuriated, the farmers reported the matter and Marseille was again suspended from flying.|$|E

500|$|Many toads {{are killed}} by traffic while {{migrating}} to their breeding grounds. In Europe they have {{the highest rate of}} mortality from roadkill among amphibians. Many of the deaths take place on stretches of road where streams flow underneath showing that migration routes often follow water courses. In some places in Germany, [...] Belgium, [...] Great Britain, Northern Italy and Poland, special tunnels have been constructed so that toads can cross under roads in safety. In other places, local wildlife groups run [...] "toad patrols", carrying the amphibians across roads at busy crossing points in buckets. The toads start moving at dusk and for them to travel far, the temperature needs to remain above [...] On a warm wet night they may continue moving all night but if it cools down, they may stop earlier. An estimate was made of the significance of roadkill in toad populations in the Netherlands. The number of females killed in the spring migration <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> country road (ten vehicles per hour) was compared with the number of strings of eggs laid in nearby fens. A 30% mortality rate was found, with the rate for deaths among males likely to be of a similar order.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{effect of}} Taft-Hartley was subtler and slower-working. It was {{to hold up}} any new {{organizing}} at all, even <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet,</b> low-key scale. For example, Taft-Hartley ended [...] "card checks." [...] … Taft-Hartley required hearings, campaign periods, secret-ballot elections, and sometimes more hearings, before a union could be officially recognized.|$|E
2500|$|In most English houses {{today the}} {{original}} intention has been lost, and these rooms have usually become a meaningless succession of drawing rooms; {{this is certainly}} true at both Wilton House and Blenheim Palace. [...] The {{reason for this is}} that, over time, the traditional occupants of the state bedrooms began to prefer the comfort of a warmer, more private bedroom <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> floor with an en-suite bathroom. [...] By the Edwardian Period, large house-parties had adapted the state rooms to use as salons for playing bridge, dancing, talking, and generally amusing themselves.|$|E

2500|$|Smokey is {{currently}} married to Frances Robinson, née Gladney. They {{were married in}} May 2002. Robinson married his fellow Miracles member Claudette Rogers in 1959. The couple had two children, son Berry Robinson (b. 1968), named after Motown's first label founder Berry Gordy, and daughter Tamla Robinson (b. 1969), named after the original [...] "Tamla" [...] label set up by Gordy that would eventually become Motown. Robinson has another son, Trey (b. 1984), with another woman, during his marriage to Claudette. After Robinson admitted this, he filed for legal separation and, later, divorce, which was granted in 1986. The Robinsons had separated once before, in 1974, and Robinson conducted an extramarital affair that became {{the concept of the}} song, [...] "The Agony & The Ecstasy", later featured <b>on</b> <b>A</b> <b>Quiet</b> Storm.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 July 2010, Cracknell {{suffered}} a hit from behind by a petrol tanker whilst cycling during {{an attempt to}} cycle, row, run and swim from Los Angeles to New York within 18 days. The accident happened at around 5.30am <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> stretch of road outside Winslow, Arizona. He has attributed his survival to the fact {{he was wearing a}} cycle helmet at the time, which was [...] "shorn in two". In the crash he {{suffered a}} contrecoup injury to the frontal lobes of his brain. He is now back at home with his family, although his recovery may never be complete. In 2012 Cracknell and his wife wrote Touching Distance about his life before and after his brain injury, which has left him with epilepsy and a changed personality, including a short temper. Since the accident he has been conspicuous in advocating the use of bicycle helmets.|$|E
