[...] To operate these fighters, it formed three tactical fighter groups, {{the first of}} which was the 507th Tactical Fighter Group at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, which was activated in May. Tinker was selected because the 937th Military Airlift Group there was slated to lose its Douglas C-124 Globemaster IIs, which were being removed from the inventory. [...] The transition to the Thunderchief was the most difficult the Reserve had faced. [...] In addition to the huge change from four reciprocating engine transports to supersonic jet fighters, declassification of the conversion only occurred in March, providing less than two months for <b>open</b> <b>actions</b> to implement the transition. [...] Although the first F-105 arrived at Tinker on 14 April, the reservists were not prepared to accept the aircraft, and a special team from Tactical Air Command arrived to inspect the aircraft and place them in temporary storage until aircrew and maintenance personnel could be trained on the fighter.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{cartridge}} extractor or ejector {{is built into}} the barrel assembly on break <b>open</b> <b>actions,</b> the breech face is simply a flat plate with a hole for the firing pin to project. This makes break <b>open</b> <b>actions</b> ideal for interchangeable barrel firearms, such as the popular Thompson Center Arms Contender and Encore pistols. The simplicity of the break open design, especially external hammer types, also reduces the cost of manufacture. There were a number of companies, such as H&R Firearms, that produced break open rifles at lower costs than comparable bolt action rifles.|$|E

40|$|The {{principle}} of least action provides a holistic worldview in which Nature {{in its entirety}} and every detail is {{described in terms of}} actions. Each and every action is ultimately composed of one or multiple of the most elementary actions which relates to Planck’s constant. Elements of space are closed actions, known as fermions, whereas elements of time are <b>open</b> <b>actions,</b> known as bosons. The actions span an energy landscape, the Universe, which evolves irreversibly according to the 2 nd law of thermodynamics by diminishing energy density differences in least time. During evolution densely-curled actions unfold step-by-step when opening up and expelling one or multiple elementary actions to their surrounding sparser space. The energy landscape will process from one symmetry group to another until the equivalence to its dual, i. e., the surrounding density has been attained. The scale-free physical portrayal of nature in terms of actions does not recognize any fundamental difference between fundamental particles and fundamental forces. Instead a plethora of particles and a diaspora of forces are perceived merely as diverse manifestations of a natural selection for various mechanisms and ways to decrease free energy in the least time...|$|E

40|$|Engineers are {{responsible}} for re-designing socio-technical systems (STSs). At the same time, the current literature on engineering re-design methodology is predominantly oriented towards technical artefacts. This methodology is not directly transferable to STSs, since STSs differ {{in the role of}} workers operating the system in collective activity. Accordingly, the central question of this dissertation is: How can engaging STS operators as participants in re-designing an assembly production system develop an approach for re-designing STSs that operationalizes human value and potential? To this aim, this dissertation develops a framework for re-designing a STS. This framework is developed with design research methodology and grounded theory, modeling the re-design of an industrial assemble-to-order production system (a sociotechnical system archetype) with 32 participants. The model consists of seven steps – ethical considerations for participation, emic problem analysis, emic system modeling, collective creativity, differentiated designs, emic problem evaluation, and emic system evaluation. The model and its supporting mechanisms make the following research contributions. (1) A developed roadmap of ethical considerations invites STS operators to take part in re-design with a basis of trust between researchers/engineers/designers and participants. (2) The developed investigative approaches for STS problem analysis and system modeling engage participants to define reference models and success criteria that guide the re-design process, including re-design foci. The reference models and success criteria before vs. after the re-design intervention are also compared to evaluate the redesign impact and experience, informing future re-design. (3) The developed model of OPEN collective creativity, from a co-design activity, engages participants in transforming the re-design foci into differentiated, contextualized designs. The nonlinear model centralizes <b>OPEN</b> <b>actions</b> (opportunities, problems, enquiries/questions, and needs) between concept and detail ideas, integrating problem solving and inquiry with collaboration. These research contributions engage STS operators as participants in operationalizing human value across the developed model for re-designing a STS. Future research is proposed to assess the limitations of the proposed re-design framework and to examine its transferability for broader research and practice in re-designing STSs...|$|E

Since there are no parts to reciprocate, it is shorter than repeating designs, and generally more compact than non-repeating firearms such as the falling block and rolling block actions.
