25|$|Reward {{dependence}} {{is characterized}} as a tendency to respond markedly to signals of reward, particularly to verbal signals of social approval, social support, and sentiment. His personality theory suggested the hypothesis that specific neurochemical transmitters in <b>our</b> <b>brain</b> determine how we respond to a specific stimulus we may experience.|$|E
25|$|Online {{infidelity}} {{can be just}} as {{damaging to}} a relationship as offline physical unfaithfulness. A possible explanation is that <b>our</b> <b>brain</b> registers virtual and physical acts the same way and responds similarly. Several studies have concluded that online infidelity, whether sexual or emotional in nature, often leads to off-line infidelity.|$|E
25|$|In Plato's philosophy, innate {{ideas are}} {{revealed}} through the Socratic Method of investigation. In linguistics, universal grammar must have {{input from the}} environment (primary linguistic data) in order for children to achieve an individual grammar (output). Biologically, our perceptual faculties are pre-wired, but they require environmental stimuli {{in order to develop}} correctly. The neurological structures in <b>our</b> <b>brain</b> that represent the location of LTM are also biologically pre-wired, yet environmental input is needed in order for memory to flourish.|$|E
50|$|According {{to several}} {{academics}} greed, like love, {{has the power}} to send a chemical rush through <b>our</b> <b>brains</b> that forces us to put aside our common sense and self-control and thus provoke changes in <b>our</b> <b>brains</b> and body. However, there is no generally accepted research on biochemistry of greed.|$|R
50|$|The most {{powerful}} argument against epiphenomenalism {{is that it}} is self-contradictory: If we have knowledge about epiphenomenalism, then <b>our</b> <b>brains</b> know about the existence of the mind, but if epiphenomenalism were correct, then <b>our</b> <b>brains</b> should not have any knowledge about the mind, because the mind does not affect anything physical.|$|R

25|$|In {{the study}} of perception, Gestalt psychologists {{stipulate}} that perceptions are the products of complex interactions among various stimuli. Contrary to the behaviorist approach to focusing on stimulus and response, gestalt psychologists sought to understand the organization of cognitive processes (Carlson and Heth, 2010). The gestalt effect is the capability of <b>our</b> <b>brain</b> to generate whole forms, {{particularly with respect to}} the visual recognition of global figures instead of just collections of simpler and unrelated elements (points, lines, curves, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Teeth (singular tooth) {{are small}} whitish {{structures}} {{found in the}} jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates {{that are used to}} tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, dentine and cementum. Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception. This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth, such as a chipped plate mixed in food, our teeth send a message to <b>our</b> <b>brain</b> and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we stop trying.|$|E
25|$|Many radical {{views of}} transsaccadic memory exist. Some are favoured {{more than others}} because of the {{evidence}} that supports them. One less-accepted theory, Breitmeyer's spatiotopic fusion hypothesis, suggested that successive images are fused based on environmental coordinates and not retinal ones. In other words, our memory stores a sequence of images from our surroundings, and joins the images together to give us a full representation in <b>our</b> <b>brain.</b> The orientation of our retinas do not have an influence on this form of memory. This theoretical form of memory supposedly stores highly detailed representations of the world in a high capacity spatial buffer. Research and experiments by other psychologists provide empirical evidence against these claims.|$|E
25|$|A Nielsen {{study shows}} {{consumers}} want {{a more personal}} connection {{in the way they}} gather information. <b>Our</b> <b>brains</b> are far more engaged by storytelling than by cold, hard facts. When reading straight data, only the language parts of <b>our</b> <b>brains</b> work to decode the meaning. But when we read a story, not only do the language parts of <b>our</b> <b>brains</b> light up, but any other part of the brain that we would use if we were actually experiencing what we're reading about becomes activated as well. This means it's far easier for us to remember stories than hard facts.|$|R

25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by <b>our</b> <b>brain</b> to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it is a step in the right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E
25|$|Unification {{is based}} upon {{triggering}} events creating unified energy fields. Taking light as an example, receptors in our eyes turn on and off at approximately 110 milliseconds. A photon is not a particle but is an accumulation of light energy at a receiving source. At the time of reception, a photon mass force is created triggering the receptor. Once a rod or cone in our eye is triggered <b>our</b> <b>brain</b> energy field merges with the energy field of the object being viewed. During this 110 ms ON interval events at the source and at the receiver are happening at the same time. Since the 4th dimension, time equals zero, the merged three dimensional energy field remains. This allows us to perceive depth and instantaneous movement at the source. It also applies to sub atomic particles as well where electromagnetic energy causes triggering events and unified fields.|$|E
25|$|At {{least some}} of our {{behaviour}} must be influenced by our genes because behaviour depends on the interaction of molecules and neurons in the brain. These interactions {{are a result of}} our genes code, however the influence on behaviour cannot go much further than this. Dawkins likened genes to a computer. They have been pre-programmed to build cells, develop cells and make them work together. Like a computer, the hardware is set in stone, but the software can change how they work, just like our environment. Genes indirectly influence our behaviour as the nervous system and <b>our</b> <b>brain</b> is the intermediary in the transaction decision because it reasons and processes all of the gene instructions into one decision, movement or behaviour. The way our neurons connect is dependent on the environment, learning and experience. This introduces the nurture side of the nature nurture debate.|$|E

25|$|McLuhan {{writes about}} robotism {{in the context}} of Japanese Zen Buddhism and how it can offer us new ways of {{thinking}} about technology. The Western way of thinking about technology is too much related to the left hemisphere of <b>our</b> <b>brain,</b> which has a rational and linear focus. What he called robotism might better be called androidism in the wake of Blade Runner and the novels of Philip K. Dick. Robotism-androidism emerges from the further development of the right hemisphere of the brain, creativity and a new relationship to spacetime (most humans are still living in 17th century classical Newtonian physics spacetime). Robots-androids will have much greater flexibility than humans have had until now, in both mind and body. Robots-androids will teach humanity this new flexibility. And this flexibility of androids (what McLuhan calls robotism) has a strong affinity with Japanese culture and life. McLuhan quotes from Ruth Benedict, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, an anthropological study of Japanese culture published in 1946: “Occidentals cannot easily credit the ability of the Japanese to swing from one behavior to another without psychic cost. Such extreme possibilities are not included in our experience. Yet in Japanese life the contradictions, as they seem to us, are as deeply based in their view of life as our uniformities are in ours.” The ability to live in the present and instantly readjust.|$|E

[...] Once {{production}} of the first movie was finished, the Coens began to recruit staff to film Barton Fink. Turturro looked forward to playing the lead role, and spent a month with the Coens in Los Angeles to coordinate views on the project: [...] "I felt I could bring something more human to Barton.

500|$|After {{returning}} from Europe, Du Bois was more determined {{than ever to}} gain equal rights for African Americans. Black soldiers {{returning from}} overseas felt {{a new sense of}} power and worth, and were representative of an emerging attitude referred to as the New Negro. In the editorial [...] "Returning Soldiers" [...] he wrote: [...] "But, by the God of Heaven, we are cowards and jackasses if, now that the war is over, we do not marshal every ounce of <b>our</b> <b>brain</b> and brawn to fight a sterner, longer, more unbending battle against the forces of hell in our own land." [...] Many blacks moved to northern cities in search of work, and some northern white workers resented the competition. This labor strife was one of the causes of the Red Summer of 1919, a horrific series of race riots across America, in which over 300 African Americans were killed in over 30 cities. Du Bois documented the atrocities in the pages of The Crisis, culminating in the December publication of a gruesome photograph of a lynching that occurred during the Omaha, Nebraska race riot.|$|E

2500|$|The {{necessity}} of making choices, and therefore of interpretation, in translating (and {{in other fields}} of human endeavor) stems from the ambiguity that subjectively pervades the universe. [...] Part of the ambiguity, for a translator, involves the structure of human language. [...] Psychologist and neural scientist Gary Marcus notes that [...] "virtually every sentence [...] is ambiguous, often in multiple ways. [...] <b>Our</b> <b>brain</b> is so good at comprehending language {{that we do not}} usually notice." [...] An example of linguistic ambiguity is the [...] "pronoun disambiguation problem" [...] ("PDP"): [...] a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a pronoun in a sentence—such as [...] "he", [...] "she" [...] or [...] "it"—refers. [...] Such disambiguation is not infallible by a human, either.|$|E
2500|$|In another {{scene in}} which a {{character}} dies from solar exposure among the ashes from cremated bodies, massive wind turbines propelled biodegradable dust at the actor in the director's attempt to have the computer-generated effects follow the actor instead of vice versa. Boyle commented on his approach to using effects, [...] "There is part of <b>our</b> <b>brain</b> where we admire the effect, but we {{put it in a}} side compartment of our experience because you know there's no way an actor can live through that, or be there in that moment." [...] During the post-production process, Boyle hired one visual effects company, London's Moving Picture Company, to work on the film's 750 visual effects. The assignment of a single company was contrary to the industry trend of hiring multiple vendors to work on a film's effects. Boyle chose one company for ease of quality control, though the decision resulted in a prolonged post-production process.|$|E
2500|$|In his book, The Moral Landscape, {{author and}} neuroscientist Sam Harris also argues against free will. He offers one thought {{experiment}} where a mad scientist represents determinism. In Harris' example, the mad scientist uses a machine to control all the desires, and thus all the behavior, {{of a particular}} human. Harris believes {{that it is no}} longer as tempting, in this case, to say the victim has [...] "free will". Harris says nothing changes if the machine controls desires at random - the victim still seems to lack free will. Harris then argues that we are also the victims of such unpredictable desires (but due to the unconscious machinations of <b>our</b> <b>brain,</b> rather than those of a mad scientist). Based on this introspection, he writes [...] "This discloses the real mystery of free will: if our experience is compatible with its utter absence, how can we say that we see any evidence for it in the first place?" [...] adding that [...] "Whether they are predictable or not, we do not cause our causes." [...] That is, he believes there is compelling evidence of absence of free will.|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, {{alarmed by}} what he {{considered}} to be SR Serbia's president Slobodan Milošević's extreme nationalism {{as well as the}} level of popular support he enjoyed, Popović created Vreme, a weekly magazine that became one of the prominent independent publications. Vremes first issue came out on Monday, 29 October, featuring, among the political and social topics, Popović's speech from the meeting of the Serb and Croat intellectuals that took place several days earlier at the University Professors' Club (Klub sveučilišnih nastavnika) in Zagreb. Prefacing his presentation by relaying a personal observation that since he didn't feel he possessed the intellectual authority of a man of science only meant he's addressing the gathering as a 'Serb', making his stance just one of 8 million possible views, Popović opined that the meeting came too early since, according to him, [...] "Serbs and Croats hadn't yet gone through enough soul-searching that would make them into political peoples, a mandatory prerequisite for a dialogue between nations". He continued that this was due to the circumstance that [...] "just like {{the hundreds of millions of}} Europeans, Serbs and Croats went through the trauma of World War II, but then continued straight into another trauma — communism — a bloody experiment of social-political engineering that forcibly stopped their natural and organic development". He continued: [...] "Both as individuals and peoples, we went through extended violence and humiliation. We experienced physical eradication, slave-like exploitation, breaking of our spine, and washing of <b>our</b> <b>brain.</b> Kočevski Rog, Bleiburg, Goli otok, collectivization and buyout, summary executions of political opponents after gaining power, the terror of UDBA and SDB — all of them crimes, and the corpses are rising to the surface almost daily. Instead of collectively cancelling our membership in communism, we must, each nation respectively within itself, face one another. I'm not advocating anti-communist retribution, but until Serbs and Croats face their own selves, until they experience their own historical catharsis some of which predates 1945, they won't return to history, to regular time, and to the international community. The system was not only based on repression, but also, especially in its latter stages, on collaboration, corruption, intellectual capitulation, stupidity, and conformism".|$|E
