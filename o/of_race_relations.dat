5|$|Sanford was a {{major public}} figure of the post-World WarII South. He {{played a key role}} in the {{transformation}} of Southern politics into the New South, primarily in the areas <b>of</b> <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> and education. In recognition of his efforts in education and in countless other areas, a 1981 Harvard University survey named him one of the 10 best governors of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{story has}} been read as an {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>race</b> <b>relations,</b> not {{between black and white}} but within the black community, exploring its own color and class prejudices. The main character dreams of becoming white but ultimately seems to accept being black and the full history of African Americans in the United States. The ending of the story, however, has been called ambiguous and leaves several questions unanswered.|$|E

5|$|The Legion spurred {{several million}} Roman Catholics across the U.S. {{to sign up}} for the boycott, {{allowing}} local religious leaders to determine which films to protest. Conservative Protestants tended to support much of the crackdown, particularly in the South, where anything relating to the state <b>of</b> <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> or miscegenation could not be portrayed. Although the Central Conference of American Rabbis joined in the protest, it was an uneasy alliance given the heavy presence of Jewish studio executives and producers, which, it was felt had inspired {{at least some of the}} vitriol from the Catholic groups.|$|E
5|$|He later {{published}} {{two articles}} in the National Urban League's journal, , that discussed the difficulties faced by African-American mineworkers. His work in this field also addressed his concern about blacks and their white counterparts. Harris examined race prejudice of blacks by white workers. Meanwhile, Harris taught at West Virginia State University, a small historically black public college in Institute, West Virginia. During this year, he began a long and sustaining friendship with V. F. Calverton. He taught for a year, before he shifted directions and took the position {{as director of the}} Minneapolis Urban League. As director, he prepared a detailed report titled The Negro Population in Minneapolis: A Study <b>of</b> <b>Race</b> <b>Relations</b> dealing with the living conditions of African Americans in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Harris described the physical and socio-economic conditions of African Americans in Minneapolis in 1926.|$|E

40|$|At {{the end of}} the 1960 s, the United States {{military}} was rocked by race-related violence and riots. Growing fears of black “militancy” eventually compelled the military’s largely white leadership to implement policies aimed at ameliorating racial disparities. One of the most significant changes was the establishment <b>of</b> the Defense <b>Race</b> <b>Relations</b> Institute (DRRI) and the requirement that all troops partake in <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> education. Largely overlooked in histories <b>of</b> military <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> and rarely viewed in terms of its place in the larger landscape <b>of</b> US <b>race</b> <b>relations,</b> DRRI was founded to train the military’s <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> educators. Its original curriculum and methodology, during the years 1971 - 74, represented a radical response to the problems of racism in the military, and central to its framework was a critique of whiteness as a nexus of racialized power. This paper attempts to present a complex understanding of the motivations involved in the founding of the DRRI as it historicizes the military’s quest to contain race “militancy” through the establishment of DRRI...|$|R

25|$|In 1816, a {{group of}} wealthy European-Americans, {{some of whom were}} abolitionists and others who were racial segregationists, founded the American Colonization Society with the express desire of {{returning}} African Americans who were in the United States to West Africa. In 1820, they sent their first ship to Liberia, and within a decade around two thousand African Americans had been settled in the west African country. Such re-settlement continued throughout the 19th century, increasing following the deterioration <b>of</b> <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> in the southern states of the US following Reconstruction in 1877.|$|E

25|$|Post-apartheid South Africa {{has seen}} a loss of {{preferential}} treatment by the government for Afrikaans, in terms of education, social events, media (TV and radio), and general status throughout the country, given that it now shares its place as official language with ten other languages.

More than 300 book titles in Afrikaans are published annually.

The South African Institute <b>of</b> <b>Race</b> <b>Relations</b> (SAIRR) project that a growing majority will be Coloured Afrikaans speakers.
