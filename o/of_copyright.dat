5|$|A {{photograph}} of Schlosshotel Kronberg (then called Schloss Friedrichshof after its owner Kaiserin Friedrich) became famous {{due to its}} accidental inclusion of the photographer's wing tips.

5|$|Another {{range of}} {{extensions}} came {{in relation to}} what could be copyrighted. The Statute only referred to books, and being an Act of Parliament, {{it was necessary to}} pass further legislation to include various other types of intellectual property. The Engraving Copyright Act 1734 extended copyright to cover engravings, statutes in 1789 and 1792 involved cloth, sculptures were copyrighted in 1814 and the performance of plays and music were covered by copyright in 1833 and 1842 respectively. The length <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> was also altered; the Copyright Act 1814 set a copyright term of either 28 years, or the natural life of the author if this was longer. Despite these expansions, some still felt copyright was not a strong enough regime. In 1837, Thomas Noon Talfourd introduced a bill into Parliament to expand the scope <b>of</b> <b>copyright.</b> A friend of many men of letters, Talfourd aimed to provide adequate rewards for authors and artists. He campaigned for copyright to exist {{for the life of the}} author, with an additional 60 years after that. He also proposed that existing statutes be codified under the bill, so that the case law that had arisen around the Statute of Anne was clarified.|$|E
5|$|Apple v. Franklin {{established}} the fundamental basis <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> of computer software, {{even if it}} was provided only as object code or in firmware. In 1982, Apple filed a lawsuit against Franklin Computer Corp., alleging that Franklin's ACE 100 personal computer used illegal copies of the Apple II's operating system and ROM. The case was decided in Franklin's favor but reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.|$|E

40|$|Digitisation <b>of</b> <b>Copyrighted</b> Works The thesis {{deals with}} the issue <b>of</b> {{digitisation}} <b>of</b> <b>copyrighted</b> works. The aim of this work {{is to provide a}} comprehensive account of the digitisation phenomenon in relation to copyrighted works {{from the point of view}} <b>of</b> the Czech <b>Copyright</b> Act and to analyse two digitisation projects to identify practical issues and, if possible, solutions to these. The text is divided into five chapters, each of them dedicated to a different aspect of the topic presented. The first of the two introductory chapters focuses on the legal institute <b>of</b> <b>copyrighted</b> work as defined by the <b>Copyright</b> Act <b>of</b> the Czech Republic. The five subchapters analyse the concept <b>of</b> <b>copyrighted</b> work, examine legal fiction expanding the set of protected objects and specify the respective protected objects within the category <b>of</b> <b>copyrighted</b> works. The two subchapters comprising the following chapter study the phenomenon of digitisation from the factual point of view. The first subchapter describes the concept of digitisation, focusing on technical aspects, while the second one makes distinction between the digitisation and born-digital materials. The third chapter provides ground for merging the legal aspects <b>of</b> <b>copyrighted</b> works and the factual aspects of digitisation into the key issue of digitisation of [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Because the {{encryption}} key {{may be used}} as part of circumvention technology forbidden by the DMCA, its possession and distribution has been viewed as illegal by the AACS, as well as by some legal professionals.

Opponents to the expansion of the scope <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> criticize the idea of making a particular number illegal.|$|E
5|$|Dame Joan Evans, {{who owned}} the {{copyright}} to An Adventure, accepted the Jullian explanation and forbade any further editions.

5|$|Debates {{over the}} origin of falafel have {{sometimes}} devolved into political discussions {{about the relationship between}} Arabs and Israelis. In modern times, falafel has been considered a national dish of Egypt, Palestine, and of Israel. Resentment exists amongst many Palestinians for {{what they see as the}} appropriation of their dish by Israelis. Additionally, the Lebanese Industrialists' Association has raised assertions <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> infringement against Israel concerning falafel.|$|E

5|$|Did Harrison {{deliberately}} use {{the music}} of He's So Fine? I do not believe he did so deliberately. Nevertheless, {{it is clear that}} My Sweet Lord is the very same song as He's So Fine with different words, and Harrison had access to He's So Fine. This is, under the law, infringement <b>of</b> <b>copyright,</b> and is no less so even though subconsciously accomplished.|$|E

5|$|Moral {{rights in}} United Kingdom law are parts <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> law that protect the {{personal}} {{interests of the}} author of a copyrighted work, as well as the economic interests protected by other elements <b>of</b> <b>copyright.</b> Found in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, the moral rights are the right to be identified as {{the author of a}} work, known as the right of paternity, the right to object to derogatory treatment of a work, known as the right of integrity, the right not to be identified as the author of someone else's work, and the right to privacy. The right of paternity exists for the entire copyright term, and requires individuals who commercially broadcast, sell, perform or exhibit literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works to identify the author of the work – but this does not apply to things such as typefaces, encyclopaedias or works subject to crown copyright.|$|E

2500|$|While Bill C-60 did {{not alter}} {{the right to make}} private copies <b>of</b> <b>copyrighted</b> material, it {{introduced}} limitations on the use of these private copies.
