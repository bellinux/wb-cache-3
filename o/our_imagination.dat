Their imagination makes the two more human and yet also destroys them. As Kinnaird points out (elaborating on {{an idea of}} Joseph W.

500|$|Public {{interest}} in the Cottingley Fairies gradually subsided after 1921. Elsie and Frances eventually married and lived abroad for many years. In 1966, a reporter from the Daily Express newspaper traced Elsie, who was by then back in England. She admitted in an interview given that year that the fairies might have been [...] "figments of my imagination", but left open the possibility she believed that she had somehow managed to photograph her thoughts. The media subsequently became interested in Frances and Elsie's photographs once again. BBC television's Nationwide programme investigated the case in 1971, but Elsie stuck to her story: [...] "I've told you that they're photographs of figments of <b>our</b> <b>imagination,</b> and that's what I'm sticking to".|$|E

Ultimately, when reading Amir's poems [...] "in <b>our</b> <b>imagination</b> {{we do not see}} a man in pants, a jacket, and tie, but a youth in traditional Malay garb".

500|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{began working}} on the project in early 2007. They found {{difficulties}} in recruiting a production company for the shooting of [...] "A Beautiful Lie" [...] since most operators passed on the project, who considered it to be risky and dangerous. After six months, Yamani Watkins and Edy Enriquez attached to produce, while Elliott Lester was set to co-direct the short film. The crew spent a month in Ilulissat, Greenland, preparing pre-production; almost 200 different kinds of insurance were required to shoot the video. Determined to offset the impact of filming on the environment, Thirty Seconds to Mars worked with the Natural Resources Defense Council on strategies that minimized fuel consumption on the shoot, using renewable energy products. Jared Leto described the whole project as [...] "one of the most painstaking and difficult creative challenge we have ever undertaken as a band. It has also {{been one of the}} most inspiring – a rare opportunity to reach into <b>our</b> <b>imagination</b> and push the limits of what's possible."

He explained, [...] "I would hate to think <b>our</b> <b>imagination</b> is so slender that there aren't other possibilities to think about." [...] The first casting call was sent out on December 10, 1986. While some characters such as Geordi La Forge and Beverly Crusher remain recognizable from their descriptions in the initial casting call, others have clear differences; [...] "Julien Picard" [...] would lapse into a French accent when he became emotional, and Data was non-Caucasian. Macha Hernandez was a Latino security chief based on Jenette Goldstein's role in Aliens, while Deanna Troi was to appear [...] "foreign" [...] or more specifically of an Icelandic or Scandinavian nature. Leslie Crusher was listed as a fifteen-year-old girl with a photographic memory, although was quickly changed to a male teenager called Wesley. Justman argued for a female teenager but Roddenberry thought {{that there would be a}} greater number of storylines available if the character was male.|$|E

Kalpana Datta, a classmate of Pritilata, writes in the biography Chittagong Armoury Raiders– [...] "We had no clear idea in our school days about our future.

2500|$|A person’s imagination, {{regardless}} of how boundless it may seem, is confined to the mind’s ability to recombine the information it has already acquired from the body’s sensory experience (the ideas that have been derived from impressions). In addition, “as <b>our</b> <b>imagination</b> takes our most basic ideas and leads us to form new ones, it is directed by three principles of association, namely, resemblance, contiguity, and cause and effect." [...] The principle of resemblance refers to the tendency of ideas to become associated if the objects they represent resemble one another. For example, a person looking at an illustration of a flower can conceive of {{an idea of the}} physical flower because the idea of the illustrated object is associated with the idea of the physical object. The principle of contiguity describes the tendency of ideas to become associated if the objects they represent are near to each other in time or space, such as when the thought of one crayon in a box leads a person to think of the crayon contiguous to it. Finally, the principle of cause and effect refers to the tendency of ideas to become associated if the objects they represent are causally related, which explains how remembering a broken window can make someone think of the baseball that caused the window to shatter.|$|E

2500|$|Giddens' {{theory of}} {{structuration}} explores {{the question of}} whether it is individuals or social forces that shape our social reality. He eschews extreme positions, arguing that although people are not entirely free to choose their own actions, and their knowledge is limited, they nonetheless are the agency which reproduces the social structure and leads to social change. His ideas find an echo in the philosophy of the modernist poet Wallace Stevens who suggests that we live in the tension between the shapes we take as the world acts upon us, and the ideas of order that <b>our</b> <b>imagination</b> imposes upon the world. Giddens writes that the connection between structure and action is a fundamental element of social theory, structure and agency are a duality that cannot be conceived of apart from one another and his main argument is contained in his expression [...] "duality of structure". At a basic level, this means that people make society, but are at the same time constrained by it. Action and structure cannot be analysed separately, as structures are created, maintained and changed through actions, while actions are given meaningful form only through the background of the structure: the line of causality runs in both directions making it impossible to determine what is changing what. In Giddens own words (from New rules...) : ...|$|E
