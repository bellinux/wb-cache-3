Not always, but in many cases, they are chatting to each other assuming the user (that is, the reader) knows well the games released by Leaf and by Key.Also note that, in many cases, Unyū does not speak standard Japanese, but speaks the Osaka dialect(as often as not it is a fake Osaka dialect made up by a non-Osaka dialect speaker).|$|R
60|$|He also decided, {{which was}} more to his purpose, that Eleanor did not care a straw for him, and that very <b>probably</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> care a straw for his rival. Then he {{made up his mind}} not to think of her any more, and went on {{thinking}} of her till he was almost in a state to drown himself in the little brook which ran {{at the bottom of the}} archdeacon's grounds.|$|R
6000|$|According to Mrs. Leigh (see {{her letter}} to Hodgson, Nov., 1816, Memoirs of Rev. F. Hodgson, 1878, ii. 41), Murray paid Lady Byron [...] "the compliment" [...] of showing her the {{transcription}} of the Third Canto, {{a day or}} two after it came into his possession. Most <b>probably</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not know <b>or</b> recognize Claire's handwriting, but she could not fail to remember that but one short year ago she had herself been engaged in transcribing The Siege of Corinth and Parisina for the press. Between the making of those two [...] "fair copies," [...] a tragedy had intervened.] ...|$|R
6000|$|Who was Jasper? He was the {{brother-in-law}} of {{the late}} Mr. Drood, a respected engineer, and University man. We do not know whence came Mrs. Drood, Jasper's sister, but is it likely that her mother [...] "drank heaven's-hard"--so the hag says of herself--then took to keeping an opium den, and there entertained her son Jasper, already an accomplished vocalist, but in a lower station than that to which his musical genius later raised him, as lay Precentor? If the Princess Puffer be, as on Mr. Cuming Walters's theory she is, Edwin's long-lost grandmother, her discovery would be unwelcome to Edwin. <b>Probably</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not live much longer; [...] "my lungs are like cabbage nets," [...] she says. Mr. Cuming Walters goes on - ...|$|R

60|$|When the {{excitement}} of this tempestuous meeting had spent itself, Señor Villaverde, who stood looking on with grave, impressive face, spoke to Demetria, telling her that his old friend, General Santa Coloma, had just informed him of her arrival in Buenos Ayres and of the hotel where <b>she</b> was staying. <b>Probably</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not even know who he was, he said; he was her relation; {{his mother was a}} Peralta, a first cousin of her unhappy father, Colonel Peralta. He had come to see her with his daughters to invite her to make his house her home during her stay in Buenos Ayres. He also wished to help her with her affairs, which, his friend the General had informed him, were in some confusion. He had, he concluded, many influential friends in the sister city, who would be ready to assist him in arranging matters for her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{understand}}:' Madame de Quinet laughed, and <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> {{understand more}} than reluctant, anxious Isaac Gardon thought <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> of his winning, gracious, yet haughty, head-strong little charge, so humbly helpful one moment, so self-asserting and childish the next, so dear to him, yet so unlike anything in his experience.|$|R
60|$|But Miss Mackenzie, who {{certainly}} was a Stumfoldian {{by her own}} choice, should not have used the name. <b>She</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not know the whole truth as to that passage of arms between Mr Paul and Mrs Stumfold, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> know that no name in Littlebath was so odious to the lady {{as that of the}} rival clergyman.|$|R
60|$|Her silence <b>probably</b> {{meant that}} <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not know. Shefford sensed less strain in her and more excitement. He {{believed}} {{he was on the}} right track and did not regret his impulse. Even had he regretted it he would have gone on, for opposed to caution and intelligence was his driving mystic force.|$|R
50|$|After {{the death}} of Ahmad al-Mukarram, Sayyada Arwa was {{encouraged}} by al-Mustansir Billah to marry her late husband's cousin, Saba ibn Ahmad. This <b>she</b> <b>did</b> reluctantly in 1091 {{in order to remain}} in power, but <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not allow the marriage to be consummated. She continued to rule Yemen until Saba died in 1101. From that time on she ruled alone.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{trace of}} {{moisture}} on Muriel Gascoyne's cheek, but she held herself erect, and she was tall and large of frame, {{as well as a}} reposeful young woman. Though <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not know it, there was a suggestion of steadfast unchangeableness in her unconscious pose.|$|R
60|$|Then to {{have seen}} the tiara of Lady Ware, as it wagged and nodded while she looked at Mrs Munro, and to have {{witnessed}} the high moral tone of the ferocity with which she stalked away to her own stall with her daughters behind her,--a tragi-comedy which {{it was given to}} no male eyes to behold,--would have been worth the whole after-performance of the bazaar. No male eyes beheld that scene, as Mr Manfred Smith, the manager, had gone out to look for his duchess, and missing her carriage in the crowd, did not return till the bazaar had been opened. That Mrs Chaucer Munro did not sink, collapsed, among her bevy, must have been owing altogether to that callousness which a long habit of endurance produces. <b>Probably</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> feel something as at the moment there came no titter from any other bevy corresponding to the titter which was raised by her own. She and her bevy retired to their allotted place, conscious that their time for glory could not come till the male world should appear upon the scene. But Lady Ware's tiara still wagged and nodded behind her counter, and Margaret, looking at her, thought that she must have come there as the grand duenna of the occasion.|$|R
50|$|Þorgerðr {{probably}} had the stone made {{as soon as}} she had learnt that Assur, the last one of her uncles, had died in Greece, and <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> this to ensure her right of inheritance. On the reverse side of the stone, she inscribed how her other uncles had died in fornyrðislag.|$|R
50|$|While Book I is {{narrowly}} allegorical, Book II of Gulliver's Travels is less specifically a roman a clef {{and more}} generally {{a political and}} philosophical discussion. While Glumdalclitch could represent Swift's memories of the young Stella from his time living with William Temple at Moor Park, Surrey, <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> not stand in for any particularly identifiable historical person.|$|R
50|$|A popular player, <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> {{her best}} work in Irvin Willat's feature production, The False Faces (1919), for release through Ince-Paramount. Anderson {{produced}} her own film, Bubbles (1920), {{which had a}} splendid reception by the public. She was four feet and eleven inches in height and weighed one hundred and five pounds, and had golden hair and blue eyes. She was an expert swimmer.|$|R
50|$|Isabel Letham (23 May 1899 - 11 March 1995) was an Australian pioneer {{surfboard}} rider {{and swimming}} instructor, renowned as 'the first Australian {{to ride a}} surfboard' (although she disputed that claim - Isma Amor of Manly {{is believed to be}} the first Australian Female Surfer and Tommy Walker of Manly {{is believed to be the}} first Australian Male Surfer). A probably erroneous story has been repeated for years that on 10 January 1915 at Freshwater Beach, Sydney she experimented riding a board in the Hawaiian tradition in tandem with Duke Kahanamoku. This story has been disputed by researchers who have investigated its roots and provenance, and the reality is <b>probably</b> that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not do so until shortly after, at Dee Why beach in Sydney, on February 6, 1915.|$|R
50|$|Maxwell Arnold as Nolan (Main: Seasons 4-5, 7, 9-10, 14-present. Guest: Season 8): Nolan is a 19-year-old boy. Ten {{years ago}} he had a near-death experience. Since then, he can hear voices, astrally project, and does not age. Although Sunshine Girl always states {{that he would not}} be her boyfriend, they build a very special relationship. He said he loved her but she never said it back, even though <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does.</b>|$|R
60|$|Late {{the same}} evening, my wife, {{crossing}} the isle to windward, {{was aware of}} singing in the bush. Nothing {{is more common in}} that hour and place than the jubilant carol of the toddy-cutter swinging high overhead, beholding below him the narrow ribbon of the isle, the surrounding field of ocean, and the fires of the sunset. But this was of a graver character, and seemed to proceed from the ground-level. Advancing a little in the thicket, Mrs. Stevenson saw a clear space, a fine mat spread in the midst, and on the mat a wreath of white flowers and one of the devil-work boxes. A woman--whom we guess to have been Mrs. Terutak'--sat in front, now drooping over the box like a mother over a cradle, now lifting her face and directing her song to heaven. A passing toddy-cutter told my wife that <b>she</b> was praying. <b>Probably</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not so much pray as deprecate; and perhaps even the ceremony was one of disenchantment. For the box was already doomed; it was to pass from its green medicine-tree, reverend precinct, and devout attendants; to be handled by the profane; to cross three seas; to come to land under the foolscap of St. Paul's; to be domesticated within hail of Lillie Bridge; there to be dusted by the British housemaid, and to take perhaps the roar of London for the voice of the outer sea along the reef. Before even we had finished dinner Chench had begun his journey, and one of the newspapers had already placed the box upon my table as the gift of Tembinok'.|$|R
5000|$|Crouse {{gave some}} insight into her view on her character, [...] "She's such an extremist. She has a vision of what <b>she</b> wants to <b>do.</b> <b>She</b> feels like she's testing the {{boundaries}} of something, and any human being always feels important no matter who they are. I'm sure she admires Dr. Frankenstein - <b>or</b> Einstein. <b>She's</b> <b>probably</b> a mix of those two. I like her caustic nature, because she's not a mean person. I have always imagined that Maggie treats people like grown-ups. That she doesn't {{want to live in}} a world of babies. She doesn't have the time for it. The Initiative is her baby." ...|$|R

"Monsieur," [...] said Mademoiselle St. Pierre, rising, {{and this}} time {{speaking}} with her own sweet smile, [...] "I have the honour to tell you that, with a single exception, every person in classe has offered her bouquet. For Meess Lucie, Monsieur will kindly make allowance; as a foreigner <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not know our customs, or did not appreciate their significance. Meess Lucie has regarded this ceremony as too frivolous to be honoured by her observance." ...|$|R

While the average reader of this particular item of graffiti probably notices that ELVIS and LIVES use the same letters, he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> muses over it for not more than a second or two, thinking how appropriate/cute/sad, before dismissing the matter. The serious logologist, however, gives the matter more attention...|$|R

5000|$|On the {{day after}} the shooting, Donald Trump, {{appearing}} on Fox & Friends, questioned Geller's motives. He said, [...] "It looks like she's just taunting everybody. What is <b>she</b> <b>doing?</b> Drawing Mohammed and it looks like she's actually taunting people. (...) You know, I'm one that believes in free speech, <b>probably</b> more than <b>she</b> <b>does.</b> But what's the purpose of this?" [...] In response to Trump's remarks, Bill O'Reilly said in his program The O'Reilly Factor, [...] "Mr. Trump is correct. By setting up a contest and awarding $10,000 for a depiction of the Prophet Mohammed, the American Freedom Defense Initiative spurred a violent attack. (...) Insulting a religion with more than a billion followers does not advance the cause of defeating the fanatical jihadists. It hurts the cause." ...|$|R
5000|$|Harvey {{has also}} commented: [...] "I {{know enough to}} know that <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> didn't <b>do</b> any of the murders, that she was just in a {{relationship}} where <b>she</b> was <b>probably</b> too attached to the man who was doing it to extricate herself. That her life was probably too dull and boring to throw the relationship away ... I don't believe that's 30 years' worth of {{reputation as one of the}} most vile and notorious murderers in British criminal history." ...|$|R
5000|$|Weiwei Zhang (vivibear) {{was born}} on November 26, 1977 in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province. She {{attended}} Zhejiang University of Media and Communications (ZUMC) as an undergraduate, but conflicting reports from {{the media and the}} author herself imply that <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not receive an accredited diploma from this university. [...] After leaving college, Zhang worked at the official TV station in the city of Ningbo. Not long after she left her job to marry a Swedish man in 2004. The couple now reside in Sweden.|$|R
60|$|Tarzan {{shrugged his}} broad shoulders. The {{conversation}} seemed profitless {{and it was}} further distasteful to him {{for the reason that}} it was carried on in German, a tongue which he detested as much as he did the people who spoke it. He wished that the girl spoke English and then {{it occurred to him that}} as he had seen her in disguise in the British camp carrying on her nefarious work as a German spy, <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> speak English and so he asked her.|$|R
50|$|During {{her long}} tenure Mrs Pettitt served in three roles: {{orchestra}} conductor, vocal director and dramatic director. <b>She</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> {{so for a}} longer, unbroken period than any other American woman. The difficulty of this challenge was illustrated by Boris Goldovsky, who pursued {{a career as a}} conductor before becoming an opera lover. In his first conducting class with Fritz Reiner, he was confronted with the notion that an art form he despised (Goldovsky as a student loathed opera) comprised the most difficult and demanding form of conducting.|$|R
50|$|Hugh le Despenser {{the younger}} and Eleanor are {{generally}} credited with having begun the renovations to Tewkesbury Abbey, {{a foundation of}} her ancestors, which transformed it {{into one of the}} finest example of the decorated style of architecture surviving today. The famous fourteenth-century stained-glass windows in the choir, which include the armour-clad figures of Eleanor's ancestors, brother and two husbands, were most likely Eleanor's own contribution, although <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not live to see them put in place. The naked kneeling woman watching the Last Judgment in the choir's east window may represent Eleanor.|$|R
5000|$|The Gurs {{internment}} camp {{had been created}} {{a couple of years}} earlier to accommodate fighters returning from the Spanish Civil War. By around 1942 it was conventionally secure, but during 1940 [...] "security" [...] was for most purposes dependent on {{the fact that it was}} a long way up a small mountain valley and a very long way off the beaten track. Sources record that she escaped from Gurs, which <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> by walking out through the font gate and not returning from the village in the evening. Making her way back across France, as <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> would have been a greater challenge. On returning to Paris she was able to work incognito, singing for the radio stations set up in France to entertain the German troops controlling northern France.|$|R
5000|$|The New York Times {{referred}} to the illustrations as [...] "graceful". University of Alberta political science professor Thomas Butko offered criticism, claiming the authors' belief that children stereotype Muslims as terrorists has an adverse effect on the good {{they are trying to}} do by publishing the book. [...] The Ottawa Citizen wrote that it was sad that the authors [...] "found it necessary to write a book reassuring children that people who look different are not going to blow them up", and [...] "if the little reader wasn't afraid before, he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> is now".|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{came from}} abroad, I believe. And {{she came here}} just after you left. Van Loo, after he became {{secretary}} of the Ditch Company, sent {{for her and her}} daughter to keep house for him. But you'll see her to-day <b>or</b> to-morrow <b>probably,</b> when <b>she</b> returns. I'll introduce you; she'll be rather glad to meet some one from abroad, and all the more if he happens to be rich and distinguished, and eligible for her daughter." [...] He stopped suddenly in his smile, remembering Demorest's lifelong secret. But to his surprise his companion's face, instead of darkening as it was wont to do at any such allusion, brightened suddenly with a singular excitement as he answered dryly, [...] "Ah well, if the girl is pretty, who knows!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps not. And {{when a man}} checks all a woman's finer sentiments {{towards him}} by marrying her, it is only natural that it should find a vent somewhere. However, <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> not know of my {{downfall}} since father's death. I hardly {{think she would have}} cared to <b>do</b> it had <b>she</b> known that. (I am assuming that it is Ethelberta--Mrs. Petherwin--who sends it: of course I am not sure.) We must remember that when I knew her I was a gentleman at ease, who had not the least notion that I should have to work for a living, and not only so, but should have first to invent a profession to work at out of my old tastes.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's where Mrs. Green wouldn't {{agree with}} you. Perhaps {{because it would}} make the bold things happy to have masters, though <b>she</b> <b>does</b> n't say so. <b>Probably</b> <b>she</b> wants the women to have women doctors so they won't be so well, and can have more time to think whether they have been good or not. You ought to hear some of the ladies over there talk, mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|When she was gone, Ashurst thought: 'Did {{she think}} I was {{chaffing}} her? I wouldn't for the world!' He {{was at that}} age when to some men [...] "Beauty's a flower," [...] as the poet says, and inspires in them the thoughts of chivalry. Never very conscious of his surroundings, it was some time before {{he was aware that}} the youth whom Garton had called [...] "a Saxon type" [...] was standing outside the stable door; and a fine bit of colour he made in his soiled brown velvet-cords, muddy gaiters, and blue shirt; red-armed, red-faced, the sun turning his hair from tow to flax; immovably stolid, persistent, unsmiling he stood. Then, seeing Ashurst looking at him, he crossed the yard at that gait of the young countryman always ashamed not to be slow and heavy-dwelling on each leg, and disappeared round the end of the house towards the kitchen entrance. A chill came over Ashurst's mood. Clods? With all the good will in the world, how impossible to get on terms with them! And yet--see that girl! Her shoes were split, her hands rough; but--what was it? Was it really her Celtic blood, as Garton had said?--she was a lady born, a jewel, though <b>probably</b> <b>she</b> could <b>do</b> no more than just read and write! ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{her first}} {{appearance}} as a three-year-old, Tiggy Wiggy was tried over seven furlongs in the Fred Darling Stakes at Newbury in April. She started favourite but finished third behind Redstart and Jellicle Ball. Richard Hannon commented: [...] "Richard Hughes said she wouldn't have won at five, {{six or seven}} furlongs today... <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> get the trip but she has run a little bit lacklustre and below expectations". Tiggy Wiggy faced Redstart and Jellicle Ball again, as well as ten other fillies when she contested the 202nd running of the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket on 3 May. She produced a much better performance, disputing the lead {{for most of the}} way before finishing third behind the Irish-trained Legatissimo and Lucida.|$|R
60|$|By {{the law of}} the Church--she being a minor under twenty-one--it was {{her right}} to have counsel to conduct her case, advise her how to answer when questioned, and protect her from falling into traps set by cunning devices of the prosecution. <b>She</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not know that this was her right, and that she could demand it and require it, for there was none to tell her that; but she begged for this help, at any rate. Cauchon refused it. She urged and implored, {{pleading}} her youth and her ignorance of the complexities and intricacies of the law and of legal procedure. Cauchon refused again, and said she must get along with her case as best she might by herself. Ah, his heart was a stone.|$|R
