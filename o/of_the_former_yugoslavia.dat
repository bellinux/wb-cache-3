25|$|On 25 September 1991, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 713, {{imposing}} an {{arms embargo}} {{on all of}} the former Yugoslav territories.

Over 55% of the armories and barracks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Yugoslavia</b> were located in Bosnia, owing to its mountainous terrain in anticipation of a guerrilla war had Yugoslavia been invaded, but many of those factories (such as the UNIS PRETIS factory in Vogošća) were under Serb control, and others were inoperable {{due to a lack of}} electricity and raw materials.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of Greece, all the countries of Southeast Europe were once part of the Soviet bloc. Some 49% of researchers in these countries are women (compared to 37% in Greece in 2011).

In most countries, women tend to be on a par with men among tertiary graduates in science. Between 70% and 85% of graduates are women in health, less than 40% in agriculture and between 20% and 30% in engineering. Albania has seen a considerable increase in the share of its women graduates in engineering and agriculture.|$|E

25|$|Ljubljana {{is located}} where Slovenia's two main freeways intersect, {{connecting}} the freeway route {{from east to}} west, in line with Pan-European Corridor V, and the freeway in the north–south direction, in line with Pan-European Corridor X. The city {{is linked to the}} southwest by A1-E70 to the Italian cities of Trieste and Venice and the Croatian port of Rijeka. To the north, A1-E57 leads to Maribor, Graz and Vienna. To the east, A2-E70 links it with the Croatian capital Zagreb, from where one can go to Hungary or important cities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Yugoslavia,</b> such as Belgrade. To the northwest, A2-E61 goes to the Austrian towns of Klagenfurt and Salzburg, making it an important entry point for northern European tourists. A toll sticker system has been in use on the Ljubljana Ring Road since 1 July 2008. The center of the city is more difficult to access especially in the peak hours due to long arteries with traffic lights and a large number of daily commuters. The core city center has been closed for motor traffic since September 2007 (except for residents with permissions), creating a pedestrian zone around Prešeren Square.|$|E
25|$|Arkan {{became an}} {{untouchable}} criminal figure in Belgrade and all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Yugoslavia.</b> He was really so powerful, so strong financially {{that no one}} could do anything about him....

I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but {{it was very hard to}} prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.|$|E
