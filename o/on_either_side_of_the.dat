Solentse-1P infrared detectors were carried <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superstructure. Fakel-MO and Fakel-MZ antenna comprised the IFF system. A Gerkules sonar was also fitted in addition to various radio direction finders.|$|E
5|$|For {{additional}} maneuverability, the udema carried 14 to 18 {{pairs of}} oars. Rowers {{sat on the}} weather deck <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main armament with the oar ports placed on a rectangular outrigger which improved their leverage. However, they were positioned <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> centerline battery and could not row under fire; in action, the udema {{had to rely on}} its sails for propulsion.|$|E

30|$|In addition, {{because the}} level set filter not only {{preserves}} edges but also enhances edges by inhibiting diffusion across edges and allowing diffusion <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> edge. So, standard deviation will become large in Table 1. Meanwhile, {{it appears that}} some edges are enhanced, that is, the difference <b>of</b> intensity value <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> edge becomes large (Figure 3 (i)). At a word, black will become more black while white more white <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> edge.|$|R

5|$|The {{body of the}} finetooth shark is {{slender and}} streamlined. The snout is long and pointed, with the nares preceded by short, broadly {{triangular}} flaps of skin. The eyes are large and round, with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The mouth is broad with well-defined furrows at the corners. Twelve to 15 tooth rows occur <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper jaw and 1314 tooth rows <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw. Each tooth is small and needle-like, with a narrow central cusp and smooth to minutely serrated edges. The five pairs of gill slits are long, measuring about half {{the length of the}} dorsal fin base.|$|E

5|$|A single large opening <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> back of {{the skull}} links Dimetrodon with mammals and distinguishes it {{from most of the}} {{earliest}} sauropsids, which either lack openings or have two openings. Features such as ridges {{on the inside of the}} nasal cavity and a ridge at the {{back of the}} lower jaw are thought to be part of an evolutionary progression from early tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) to mammals.|$|E
5|$|Among vertebrates, the Australian {{frilled lizard}} (Chlamydosaurus kingii) has a startling display in which wide semicircular frills <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head are fanned out; the mouth is opened wide exposing the gape; the tail is waved over the body, {{and the body}} is raised, so that the animal appears as large and {{threatening}} as possible.|$|E
5|$|Before deindustrialisation in {{the late}} 20th century, Astley's economy was linked with the textile {{industry}} and coal mines which developed during the Industrial Revolution.

5|$|Belfasts {{aviation}} capability {{was provided}} by two catapult-launched Supermarine Walrus amphibious biplanes. These could be launched from a D1H catapult mounted aft of the forward superstructure, and recovered from the water by two cranes mounted <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forward funnel. The aircraft, operated by the Fleet Air Arm's HMS Belfast Flight of 700 Naval Air Squadron, were stowed in two hangars in the forward superstructure.|$|E
5|$|Even so, {{and partly}} because of Sickles's {{unexpected}} location, Longstreet's assault did not proceed according to Lee's plan. Instead of wheeling left to join a simultaneous two-division push <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emmitsburg Road, Hood's division attacked in a more easterly direction than intended, and McLaws's and Anderson's divisions deployed brigade by brigade, in an en echelon style of attack, also heading more to the east than the intended northeast.|$|E

5|$|Instead, {{a system}} of {{multiple}} receiver antennas was adopted, each one located so that only a certain section of the sky was visible. Two horizontal receivers were mounted <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage and only saw reflections from the left or right, slightly overlapping in the middle. Two vertical receivers were mounted {{above and below the}} wing, seeing reflections above or below the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Salta {{today is}} still a very small settlement, home to {{approximately}} 35 people.

However, with its double chimney and subsequent fitting of a double Kylchap exhaust in 1937, Humorist continued to pose a problem in this regard and always had small wings <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chimney.

5|$|Stroma is {{bisected}} by a fault {{which runs}} in a north-south direction through its centre, intersected by another fault running in an east-northeast direction across {{the north of the}} island.
