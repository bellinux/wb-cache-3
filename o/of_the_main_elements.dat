5|$|The {{origins of}} Abzû {{lay in the}} {{development}} of Journey, an independent video game developed by Thatgamecompany and released in 2012. Abzûs creator, director and art director Matt Nava had previously worked as art director for Journey during its three-year development. Having worked in a game featuring a desert setting, Nava wanted to change to a more vibrant and populated setting for his next title. Nava began creating the pitch for Abzû before leaving Thatgamecompany and founding the game's developer Giant Squid Studios. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>elements</b> Nava incorporated was his love for ancient cultures and their artwork, particularly relating to the myths surrounding the concept of Abzu. Nava's love of the ocean, which he explored through his hobby of scuba diving, also figured heavily in the design of Abzû. The team at Giant Squid Studios grew to ten developers from across the industry, mainly programmers who specialized in multiple aspects of game design from gameplay to graphics, in addition to a graphical and technical artist who helped create and animate the character models. The game was first announced at the 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). It was later previewed at E3 2016. The game was released digitally on PlayStation 4 via PlayStation Network and Microsoft Windows through Steam on August 2, 2016. It released on Xbox One through Xbox Live on December 6. The game received a physical release for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on January 31, 2017. All versions were published by 505 Games.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{story was}} born from wanting to expand upon the {{original}} game's {{theme of the}} growing rift between mankind and the gods. The Greek Underworld was the one major mythical location that the developers of Titan Quest had not yet approached. As it offered {{a rich source of}} material for their creative staff, it was made the location for the expansion. The story concept the team began with was the possibility of a secondary hostile force besides the Titans that had only kept away from humans due to the presence of the Olympians, and now rose up as they retreated from human affairs. With the quests, the team worked to improve on the structure and impact they had in the original, introducing famous places and people from history and mythology. They also expanded the variety of side quests, and included elements such as legends and customs related to the dead. The script was written by Dean O'Donnell. While an experienced playwright, he encountered new challenges in writing for the video game medium, as he needed to always assume that the player had spoken first to a selected NPC and to contain the necessary information in the first line of dialogue with embellishment in additional lines. Aesthetically, the tone of Immortal Throne was darker than that of its predecessor, with one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>elements</b> of this change being the cover art: according to designer Arthur Bruno, this was in reaction to the unfavorable impression players received from the surface appearance of Titan Quest when compared to the darker take on Grecian mythology in the God of War series.|$|E

25|$|Many of the Earth's {{elements}} and minerals (or mineral nutrients) are {{contained within the}} tissues and diets of organisms. Hence, mineral and nutrient cycles trace food web energy pathways. Ecologists employ stoichiometry to analyze the ratios <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>elements</b> found in all organisms: carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P). There is a large transitional difference between many terrestrial and aquatic systems as C:P and C:N ratios are much higher in terrestrial systems while N:P ratios are equal between the two systems. Mineral nutrients are the material resources that organisms need for growth, development, and vitality. Food webs depict the pathways of mineral nutrient cycling as they flow through organisms. Most of the primary production in an ecosystem is not consumed, but is recycled by detritus back into useful nutrients. Many of the Earth's microorganisms {{are involved in the}} formation of minerals in a process called biomineralization. Bacteria that live in detrital sediments create and cycle nutrients and biominerals. Food web models and nutrient cycles have traditionally been treated separately, but there is a strong functional connection between the two in terms of stability, flux, sources, sinks, and recycling of mineral nutrients.|$|E

40|$|As part of {{on-going}} {{research into}} ground effect aerodynamics at <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Southampton, {{attempts have been}} made to shed light on variables that may influence <b>the</b> characteristic shape <b>of</b> a typical multi element airfoil downforce curve while varying ride height. To achieve the stated goal, a commercial CFD software package was used to perform a comparative aerodynamic analysis study. <b>The</b> height <b>of</b> a double element airfoil above the ground was varied, while <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> lift and drag obtained were recorded to provide baseline information. <b>The</b> angle <b>of</b> attack <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flap and <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>element</b> were then changed in order to discern any effects on the lift curve. Also investigated was the effect that <b>the</b> relative sizes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>element</b> and flap had on the lift and drag curves, since modern racing car wings vary in this manner across their span. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resulting data showed that in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> double element airfoil, increasing <b>the</b> angle <b>of</b> attack <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>element</b> reduced <b>the</b> downforce sensitivity.
