5|$|Cui Shi's book Simin yueling (四民月令) is {{the only}} {{significant}} surviving work on agriculture from the Eastern Han period, though about 3,000 written characters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fan</b> Shengzhi shu (氾勝之書), dated to the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han (33–7 BC), still survive. Cui Shi's book provides descriptions of rituals for ancestor worship, festival and religious holiday celebrations, conduct for family and kinship relations, farmwork, and the schooling season for boys. Cui Shi's book also provides detailed instructions on which months were the most profitable times {{to buy and sell}} certain types of farm-produced goods.|$|E
5|$|Following the letters, Jackson {{received}} a parcel containing a photograph <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fan,</b> {{as well as}} a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan would do the same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 is a {{high-bypass}} {{turbofan engine}} (most {{of the air}} accelerated by the fan bypasses {{the core of the}} engine and is exhausted out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> case) with several variants having bypass ratios ranging from 5:1 to 6:1, generating 18,500 to 34,000lbf (80kN to 150kN) of thrust. The variants share a common design, but the details differ. The CFM56 is a two-shaft (or two-spool) engine, meaning that there are two rotating shafts, one high-pressure and one low-pressure. Each is powered by its own turbine section (the high-pressure and low-pressure turbines, respectively). The fan and booster (low-pressure compressor) evolved over the different iterations of the engine, as did the compressor, combustor and turbine sections.|$|E
50|$|The Reds {{moved into}} a new stadium {{beginning}} in the 1912 season, as the club moved from <b>the</b> Palace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fans</b> to Redland Field. The new stadium had a seating capacity of 20,696, which was up from the 12,000 capacity at Palace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fans.</b>|$|R
25|$|This {{effect is}} seen only in case <b>of</b> {{multiple}} <b>fans.</b> <b>The</b> air flow capacities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> are compared and connected in same outlet or same inlet conditions. This causes noise, specifically {{referred to as}} Beating in case of fans in parallel. To avoid beating use is made of differing inlet conditions, differences in rotational speeds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fans,</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|In {{the present}} FC Barcelona {{is close to}} power in Catalonia, the last presidents have placed the club in a {{favorable}} position to Catalan independence movement and <b>the</b> holding <b>of</b> a referendum even with discomfort in a little part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> in Catalonia and practically <b>the</b> totality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> in <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> Spain. Although some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> directors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RCD Espanyol have manifested their independentist ideology the club stay out of politics and it is considered that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> are against <b>the</b> independence <b>of</b> Catalonia.|$|R
5|$|The dozen {{fans who}} worked on the project had been vetted by Mandelin and had prior {{localization}} experience. Thousands of hours were put into the project between hacking the game data and translating the 1,000 pages of scripted dialogue. They built their own tools for the work. The final version was released in October 2008 and issued as a patch. The patch was downloaded over 100,000 times in its first week. A fan-made, full-color, 200-page, professional-quality player's guide was released alongside the translation. The Verge cited the effort as proof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> base's dedication.|$|E
5|$|The fan {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change has {{a direct impact on}} the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates at the same speed for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).|$|E
5|$|New {{purchases}} {{of the game}} are provided with a one-time use card granting access code that unlocks the game's Cerberus Network, an online downloadable content and news service that enables bonus content for the game. However, users who bought the game used {{would have to pay}} for the Cerberus Network separately if they wanted access to the new content. This policy allows publishers to combat the used-game market; companies like GameStop have allowed costumers to sell used games back to the retailer so that the company can resell them at a small discount to other customers, but the publisher does not make a profit. BioWare online development director Fernando Melo revealed that 11% of all Mass Effect 2s downloadable content revenue came from the Cerberus Network. The policy attracted criticism from some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> community, who have criticized downloadable content as being overpriced and an incentive for developers to leave items out of the initial release.|$|E

5|$|Even before Monitor was commissioned, she ran an {{unsuccessful}} set of sea trials on 19 February. Valve {{problems with the}} main engine and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> engines prevented her from reaching the Brooklyn Navy Yard from Greenpoint {{and she had to}} be towed there the next day. These issues were easily fixed and Monitor was ordered to sail for Hampton Roads on 26 February, but her departure had to be delayed one day to load ammunition. On the morning of 27 February the ship entered the East River preparatory to leaving New York, but proved to be all but unsteerable and had to be towed back to the navy yard. Upon examination, the steering gear controlling the rudder had been improperly installed and Rowland offered to realign the rudder, which he estimated to take only a day. Ericsson, however, preferred to revise the steering gear by adding an extra set of pulleys as he believed it would take less time. His modification proved to be successful during trials on 4 March. Gunnery trials were successfully performed the previous day, although Stimers twice nearly caused disasters as he did not understand how the recoil mechanism worked on Ericsson's carriage for the 11-inch guns. Instead of tightening them to reduce the recoil upon firing, he loosened them so that both guns struck the back of the turret, fortunately without hurting anybody or damaging the guns.|$|E
5|$|The vannus is {{bordered by}} the vannal fold, which {{typically}} occurs between the postcubitus {{and the first}} vannal vein. In Orthoptera it usually has this position. In the forewing of Blattidae, however, the only fold {{in this part of}} the wing lies immediately before the postcubitus. In Plecoptera the vannal fold is posterior to the postcubitus, but proximally it crosses the base of the first vannal vein. In the cicada the vannal fold lies immediately behind the first vannal vein (lV). These small variations in the actual position of the vannal fold, however, do not affect the unity of action of the vannal veins, controlled by the flexor sclerite (3Ax), in the flexion of the wing. In the hindwings of most Orthoptera a secondary vena dividens forms a rib in the vannal fold. The vannus is usually triangular in shape, and its veins typically spread out from the third axillary like the ribs of a fan. Some of the vannal veins may be branched, and secondary veins may alternate with the primary veins. The vannal region is usually best developed in the hindwing, in which it may be enlarged to form a sustaining surface, as in Plecoptera and Orthoptera. The great fanlike expansions of the hindwings of Acrididae are clearly the vannal regions, since their veins are all supported on the third axillary sclerites on the wing bases, though Martynov (1925) ascribes most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> areas in Acrididae to the jugal regions of the wings. The true jugum of the acridid wing is represented only by the small membrane (Ju) mesad of the last vannal vein. The jugum is more highly developed in some other Polyneoptera, as in the Mantidae. In most of the higher insects with narrow wings the vannus becomes reduced, and the vannal fold is lost, but even in such cases the flexed wing may bend along a line between the postcubitus and the first vannal vein.|$|E

25|$|This {{unstable}} operation {{results from}} the development of pressure gradients {{in the opposite direction}} of the flow. Maximum pressure is observed at the discharge of the impeller blade and minimum pressure on the side opposite to the discharge side. When the impeller blades are not rotating these adverse pressure gradients pump the flow in the direction opposite to the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fan.</b> The result is the oscillation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> blades creating vibrations and hence noise.|$|E
25|$|USGS geologists {{estimate}} the deposit volume {{to be at}} least 1.8 million cubic meters (from comparing topographic scans) or 1.9 million cubic meters (from field measurements). This is among the largest rainfall-induced debris flow deposits in recorded history, though volcanic-induced debris flows can be ten times as large. Subaqueous deposition extended the shoreline an additional 40–60 meters into the sea. The deposit thicknesses range from 4–5 meters (maximum of 5.3 meters) near the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> to around 0.5 meters near the pre-flood shoreline. Maximum boulder sizes decreased towards the shoreline due to the decreasing slope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fan.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{situation}} {{occurs when}} the system resistance curve and static pressure curve <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> intersect have similar slope or parallel to each other. Rather than intersecting at a definite point the curves intersect over certain region reporting system surge. These characteristics are not observed in axial fans.|$|E
