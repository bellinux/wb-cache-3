5|$|Although not all Jews in Israel keep kosher, the {{tradition}} of kashrut strongly influences the availability of certain foods and their preparation in homes, public institutions and many restaurants, including the separation <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> <b>and</b> meat and avoiding the use of non-kosher foods, especially pork and shellfish. During Passover, bread and other leavened foods are prohibited to observant Jews and matza and leaven-free foods are substituted.|$|E

5|$|A minor {{class of}} sheep are the dairy breeds.

5|$|The Devi Bhagavata Purana narrates that Krishna and {{his lover}} Radha were enjoying dalliance, when they thirsted for milk. So, Krishna created a cow called Surabhi and a calf called Manoratha {{from the left}} side of his body, and milked the cow. When {{drinking}} the milk, the milk pot fell on the ground and broke, spilling the milk, which became the Kshirasagara, the cosmic milk ocean. Numerous cows then emerged from the pores of Surabhi's skin and were presented to the cowherd-companions (Gopas) of Krishna by him. Then Krishna worshipped Surabhi and decreed that she—a cow, the giver <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> <b>and</b> prosperity—be worshipped at Diwali on Bali Pratipada day.|$|E
5|$|Before one combat a {{beautiful}} young woman comes to him, claiming to be the daughter of a king, and offers him her love, but he refuses her.

As an eel, she trips him in the ford, but he breaks her ribs. As a wolf, she stampedes cattle across the ford, but he blinds her eye with a sling-stone. Finally, she appears as a heifer {{at the head of the}} stampede, but he breaks her leg with another sling stone.

A meal {{had been prepared}} for 15 labourers near the hospital gates; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare {{in the presence of}} food, on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed. Tarrare ate the entire meal of two large meat pies, plates of grease and salt and four gallons <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> <b>and</b> then immediately fell asleep; Courville noted that Tarrare's belly became taut and inflated like a large balloon. On another occasion Tarrare was presented with a live cat. He tore the cat's abdomen open with his teeth and drank its blood, and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones, before vomiting up its fur and skin. Following this, hospital staff offered Tarrare a variety of other animals including snakes, lizards and puppies, all of which were eaten; he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing, having first crushed its head with his teeth.|$|E

25|$|As an {{agricultural}} product, milk is extracted from non-human mammals during or soon after pregnancy. Dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011, from 260 million dairy cows. India is the world's largest producer <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> <b>and</b> {{is the leading}} exporter of skimmed milk powder, yet it exports few other milk products. The ever increasing rise in domestic demand for dairy products and a large demand-supply gap could lead to India being a net importer of dairy products in the future. The United States, India, China and Brazil are the world's largest exporters <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> <b>and</b> milk products. China and Russia were the world's largest importers <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> <b>and</b> milk products until 2016 when both countries became self-sufficient, contributing to a worldwide glut of milk.|$|E
