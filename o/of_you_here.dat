500|$|Reese and Wernick were on set every day, which Reynolds {{personally}} {{paid for}} after Fox was unwilling to. The writers had scripted the action very specifically, [...] "every kill and almost down to every punch, kick, or shot", but Tim Miller and the stunt coordinators {{were free to}} change this. Robert Alonzo and Philip J. Silvera were the stunt coordinators for the film; Silvera had provided motion capture reference for the test footage. The stunt team had a month before filming began to prepare the actors, with Skrein working [...] "nonstop" [...] to prepare. Silvera said Reynolds [...] "has a photographic memory; he'd do something {{three or four times}} and remember it very well." [...] A lot of the jokes in the film were improvised on set, particularly by Reynolds. He said that the actors often came up with around 15 alternate jokes for each one written in the script, and were generally only limited to those because of time constraints. Reese said, for example, Wernick had written some jokes for the scene where Deadpool visits Colossus and Negasonic, but on set Reynolds improvised the line [...] "You know it’s funny how I only see the two <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>here.</b> It’s like the studio couldn’t afford any more X-Men." [...] This was based in truth, and became then Fox chairman Jim Gianopulos’ favorite line.|$|E
