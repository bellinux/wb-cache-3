He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation.

40|$|To {{claim to}} believe in God without {{accepting}} that God exists independently of human minds would mean reducing God to merely a human construct, thus not real enough for being the object of religious worship. This book sets out to challenge this common view on existence and religious belief. Arguing from concrete examples of language use in children's make-believe play and other ordinary situations, Erica Appelros suggests that what makes us consider something to be real involves <b>our</b> <b>capacities</b> <b>to</b> relate <b>to</b> <b>our</b> surroundings [...] not only on grounds of their physical characteristics but also on grounds of human construction.

2500|$|Spinoza was a thoroughgoing determinist {{who held}} that {{absolutely}} {{everything that happens}} occurs through the operation of necessity. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, with freedom being <b>our</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> know we are determined and to understand why we act as we do. By forming more [...] "adequate" [...] ideas {{about what we do}} and our emotions or affections, we become the adequate cause of our effects (internal or external), which entails an increase in activity (versus passivity). This means that we become both more free and more like God, as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop. 49, Part II. However, Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen the way that it does.|$|E
5000|$|Enactivism {{argues that}} {{cognition}} arises through a dynamic interaction between an acting organism and its environment.

Natural cognitive systems...participate in the generation of meaning ...engaging in transformational and not merely informational interactions: they enact a world."

2500|$|In Buddhism it {{is taught}} {{that the idea}} of {{absolute}} freedom of choice (that is that any human being could be completely free to make any choice) is unwise, because it denies the reality of one's physical needs and circumstances. Equally incorrect is the idea that humans have no choice in life or that their lives are pre-determined. To deny freedom would be to deny the efforts of Buddhists to make moral progress (through <b>our</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> freely choose compassionate action). Pubbekatahetuvada, the belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous actions, is considered a wrong view according to Buddhist doctrines. Because Buddhists also reject agenthood, the traditional compatibilist strategies are closed to them as well. Instead, the Buddhist philosophical strategy is to examine the metaphysics of causality. Ancient India had many heated arguments about the nature of causality with Jains, Nyayists, Samkhyists, Cārvākans, and Buddhists all taking slightly different lines. In many ways, the Buddhist position is closer to a theory of [...] "conditionality" [...] than a theory of [...] "causality", especially as it is expounded by Nagarjuna in the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā.|$|E
2500|$|His {{first and}} best known book, Being and Time (1927), though unfinished, {{is one of}} the central {{philosophical}} works of the 20th century. In the first division of the work, Heidegger attempted to turn away from [...] "ontic" [...] questions about beings to ontological questions about Being, and recover the most fundamental philosophical question: the question of Being, of what it means for something to be. Heidegger approached the question through an inquiry into the being that has an understanding of Being, and asks the question about it, namely, Human being, which he called Dasein ("being-there"). Heidegger argued that Dasein is defined by Care, its practically engaged and concernful mode of Being-in-the-world, in opposition to Rationalist thinkers like René Descartes who located the essence of man in our thinking abilities. For Heidegger thinking is thinking about things originally discovered in our everyday practical engagements. The consequence of this is that <b>our</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> think cannot be the most central quality of our being because thinking is a reflecting upon this more original way of discovering the world. In the second division, Heidegger argues that human being is even more fundamentally structured by its Temporality, or its concern with, and relationship to time, existing as a structurally open [...] "possibility-for-being." [...] He emphasized the importance of Authenticity in human existence, involving a truthful relationship to our thrownness into a world which we are [...] "always already" [...] concerned with, and to our Being-towards-death, the Finitude of the time and being we are given, and the closing down of our various possibilities for being through time.|$|E
