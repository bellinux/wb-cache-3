40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the quality of Persian {{translation}} of Orwell's (1949) Nineteen Eighty-Four by Balooch (2004) based on House's (1997) model of translation quality assessment. To do so, about 10 percent of the source text was randomly selected. The profile of the source text register was produced and the genre was realized. The source text profile was compared to the translation text profile. The result of this comparison was dimensional mismatches and overt errors. The dimensional mismatches were categorized based on different dimensions of register. The overt errors which were based on denotative mismatches and target system errors were categorized into omissions, additions, substitutions, and breaches of the target language system. Then, the frequencies of occurrences of subcategories of overt errors along with their percentages were calculated. The dimensional mismatches {{and a large number}} of major overt errors including omissions and substitutions indicated that the translation was not in accordance with the House's view stating that literary works needed to be translated overtly. Mismatches on different levels of register showed that the cultural filter was applied in translation and the second-level functional equivalence required for <b>overt</b> <b>translation</b> was not reached. Therefore, the Persian translation of Nineteen Eighty-Four did not fulfill the criteria to be an <b>overt</b> <b>translation.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Throughout history, {{the process}} of {{translation}} has been approached from numerous perspectives, yet these can be distilled into two main categories: literal and free translation. In terms of translation strategy, the history of translation can be characterised generally by trends towards either literal or free translation. A preference for either is usually determined by movements in related fields such as literature, philosophy, linguistics and pragmatics. This study considers the matter of literal versus free translation {{from the perspective of}} inter-cultural literary translation. Faithfulness versus creativity is shown to be a rather complex matter, considering the fact that truthful representation of one aspect of a text does not necessarily equate total truthfulness. This study assumes a source text oriented perspective in line with recent trends towards valuing the original position and function of the source text and towards considering translation as a cultural act with the view to teaching others about foreign cultures, rather than domesticating cultural elements to correspond to the culture of the audience. One linguistic concept will be focused on with this perspective in mind: evoked meaning, which arises from the use of dialect and register. The contribution of dialect and register to character representation and contextualisation endows these language varieties with special importance, especially in the translation of culturally entrenched or historically rooted literary texts. This research considers the way in which dialect and register contribute to the meaning of a literary text, based on Baker’s description of lexical meaning (1992). The study shows how <b>overt</b> <b>translation,</b> a type of faithful translation described by Juliane House (1977, 1997 and 2009), can be employed in order to retain or re-create evoked meaning. This is done by means of a theoretical discussion and a practical illustration. For the illustration, The Long Journey of Poppie Nongena (1980), the English translation of Elsa Joubert’s novel Die Swerfjare van Poppie Nongena (1978), is analysed to prove the loss of meaning that results when dialect and register are not adequately translated because of a tendency towards domestication (cultural adaptation in favour of the audience of the translation). The study uses House’s first model for translation quality assessment (1977) to point out shortcomings related to the expression of dialect and register in this translation. The first twenty one chapters of the source text are then re-translated to illustrate how evoked meaning can be better expressed with a full implementation of <b>overt</b> <b>translation</b> strategies. <b>Overt</b> <b>translation</b> is thus proven to be a viable {{solution to the problem of}} retaining evoked meaning in literary translation.

40|$|In this paper, I aim {{to assess}} the {{translation}} quality of Tommy Wieringa’s Joe Speedboot using House’s translation quality model. In translation, the choices a translator makes affect the reader’s response. House’s model for translation quality assessment tests these choices and makes a distinction between an overt and covert translation. An <b>overt</b> <b>translation</b> is ST oriented; cultural specific elements are retained in the TT {{and it is not}} directed at the TT readers, whereas a covert translation enjoys the status of an original in the target culture. The model focuses on the lexical, syntactic and textual means used to construct the register of a text. The application of House’s TQA model to Wieringa’s Joe Speedboot will show whether it is covert, overt or an interplay of both...|$|E
40|$|In this article, the {{linguistic}} {{landscape of the}} suburb of Hervanta in Tampere, Finland is studied {{from the perspective of}} translation studies. The data, collected in 2011, consists of 22 cases of translated signage. This data was analysed by using categorisations previously developed by Reh (2004) and Edelman (2010). Additionally, numerous translation studies viewpoints and concepts are introduced, including covert and <b>overt</b> <b>translations,</b> target- and source-orientedness, domestication and foreignisation, pragmatic adaptations, and the concepts of translational assimilation and accommodation. I argue that an adequate understanding of translated signage requires paying attention not only to what is translated but also to how translations are produced, and that translation studies can offer tools for this kind of analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of poetry brings up {{questions that are}} normally not asked when analysing prose, {{at least not in}} the case of descriptive prose. This study was originated in the {{analysis of}} translated poetry and touches on controversial issues where many dogmas still stand unchallenged. Poetry and poetic prose are areas where the discourse is supposed to emphasize "connotation" rather than "denotation. " Connotations are supposed to be subjective and therefore not amenable to serious research activity. This paper discusses the categories of <b>overt</b> and covert <b>translation</b> and offers a tentative approximation to an application of the tools of pragmatics to the analysis of selected poems and their translations. It is contended that the concept of relevance can be applied to poetry to explain -and perhaps limit- interpretations open to readers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Despite a {{small but}} {{compelling}} body of literature arguing that transcription represents a key moment of choice and the exercise {{of power in the}} research process, many qualitative researchers appear to believe (or at least proceed as if they believe) that transcription is relatively unproblematic. Translation studies and its engagement with visibility, power, authenticity and fidelity has a lot to offer to qualitative researchers working critically with transcription theory and practice. This paper explores the translation studies theories of equivalence, <b>overt</b> and covert <b>translation,</b> foreignisation and domestication, and the remainder, and demonstrates some fertile connections between transcription and translation. These connections help us to think about some broader political and cultural issues in relation to transcription and academic discourse, the complexity of equivalence and the central role of the situated transcriber...|$|R
40|$|Interpreting {{in a legal}} {{setting in}} Ireland {{is not subject to}} any regulation. Police and court interpreters are neither {{certified}} nor tested. The current study aims to analyse the impact on a criminal trial of unqualified interpreters’ assistance in the pre-trial process. The starting point of the investigation is an analysis of witness statements written with the assistance of unqualified interpreters. It is followed by an analysis of the statements’ translation into Polish. The analysis of statements is performed based on Juliane House’s translation quality assessment model. Finally, analysis of court transcripts investigates the impact of translation and interpreting on the trial. The findings show that covert translation of witness statements disrupts the flow of the trial and suggest that <b>overt</b> <b>translation</b> may be more appropriate for this text type. The investigation highlights the dangers related to commissioning unqualified interpreters and translators in a legal setting and confirms an urgent need to regulate this field in Ireland. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that Juliane House’s translation quality assessment model can be successfully applied to legal texts such as witness statements...|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this paper is}} on speeches in {{literary}} discourse as the superb ideological displays of propaganda as well as their translations for having an enormous capacity for ideological manipulation. In this paper, the only present English-Azarbaijani Turkish translation of Squealer’s speech from Orwell’s Animal Farm was discoursally analyzed based on House’s revised translation quality assessment (TQA) model. According to this model, speeches as propaganda in literary texts must be translated overtly to meet the standards of an adequate translation. Of the main criteria of an <b>overt</b> <b>translation</b> are co-activating the original discourse world and being equivalent at the levels of text, register, and genre. With respect to covertly and overtly erroneous errors, the findings of the study demonstrated that enormous ideological distortions and manipulation were carried out in the Turkish translation. Therefore, the translation was a covert and inadequate one. Moreover, the social effect the source and target texts’ readerships receive would be radically different from each other. Finally, some implications and suggestions for further studies were proposed...|$|E
40|$|This is an applied {{study that}} {{critically}} analyzes the Arabic-English translation {{of a key}} cultural text: the biography of the Prophet Muhammad entitled The Sealed Nectar. It aims at assessing the translation to see how successful the translator was in composing an equivalent text to such a culture-specific one. The study adopts Juliane House's (1997) translation quality assessment model {{which is based on}} Systemic Functional Linguistic theory and relates texts to their situational and cultural contexts. In order to introduce a qualitative judgement of the work, the study enhances House’s model to make it applicable to culture-bound texts that call for <b>overt</b> <b>translation.</b> It introduces a consilience of: 1) Nord’s notion of culturemes; 2) Nida’s categorization of cultural features to help in analyzing religious terms and culture; 3) Dickins et al. ’s compensation strategies that show the translator’s endeavor to balance the translation loss while dealing with such sensitive terms; 4) Martin and White’s appraisal theory which explores attitudinal meaning and, hence, helps in investigating the translator’s evaluation of these terms; and 5) Katan’s model that helps in highlighting the correlation between levels of cultures and discourse variables (field, mode and tenor). Application of the enhanced model reveals mismatches on all the discourse variables which indicate the application of a cultural filter that adopts the norms of English academic discourse, in addition to overt errors that distort the message of this sensitive text. The study thus complements House’s framework of translation quality assessment and introduces a model that can be further applied to assess overt translations. ...|$|E
40|$|As part of {{discourse}} in the social sciences, economics textbooks written in English in which knowledge has been transferred to other languages through translation have brought a certain impact on both the target language and the target culture. In terms of ideology, this article argues about the hegemonic status of the dominant language or culture that creates socalled epistemicide or the erosion of knowledge, partly due to translation strategies adopted by the translator. Investigation is done using the corpusbased approach, theories of translation strategies and the comparative model. The study reveals that the translator in the macro-level text adopts the ideology of foreignising strategy rather than domesticating strategy when translating an economics textbook from English into Indonesian. This {{is supported by the}} use of the number of the source language-orientated translation techniques leading to two translation methods (i. e. literal translation and faithful translation) adopted in the micro-level text. This research strongly supports another relevant study pertaining to the globalisation of knowledge through translation and also the translation theories of equivalence (i. e. <b>overt</b> and covert <b>translation).</b> The research findings also have some pedagogical implications on teaching English for Specific Purposes in higher education...|$|R
40|$|Zwar gibt es in der qualitativen Sozialforschung einen kleinen und aufschlussreichen Korpus an Literatur, demzufolge Transkriptionen sowohl Schlüsselmomente von Entscheiden als auch von Macht im Forschungsprozess sind. Zugleich scheinen aber viele Forschende Transkriptionen für relativ unproblematisch zu halten (oder sie verhalten sich zumindest so). Die Translationswissenschaft mit ihrem Fokus auf Sichtbarkeit, Macht, Authentizität und Exaktheit kann hier wichtige Denkanstöße bereitstellen für Forscher/innen, die sich kritisch mit der Praxis und Theorie des Transkribierens beschäftigen. In diesem Beitrag erläutere ich zunächst einige aus der Translationswissenschaft stammende Theorien von Gleichwertigkeit, offener und verdeckter Übersetzung, von "Zähmung", "Auswilderung" und von "Rückständen", und ich versuche dann, fruchtbare Verbindungslinien zwischen Übersetzung und Transkription aufzuzeigen. Die Verbindungslinien verweisen auf weiter gehende politische und kulturelle Implikationen von Transkription und akademischem Diskurs, auf die Komplexität von Gleichwertigkeit und auf die zentrale Rolle derer, die – je spezifisch situiert – transkribieren.

A pesar de un pequeño pero convincente cuerpo de literatura argumentando que la transcripción representa un momento clave de la elección y al ejercicio del poder en el proceso de investigación, muchos investigadores cualitativos parecen creer (o al menos actúan como si lo hicieran) que la transcripción es relativamente exenta de problemas. Los estudios de traducción y su compromiso con la visibilidad, el poder, la autenticidad y la fidelidad tienen mucho que ofrecer a los investigadores cualitativos al trabajar críticamente con la teoría de la transcripción y su práctica. Este artículo explora los estudios de traducción, las teorías de la equivalencia abierta y encubierta, exteriorización y domesticación, hace un balance y muestra algunas conexiones fértiles entre transcripción y traducción. Estas conexiones nos ayudan a pensar sobre algunas cuestiones políticas y culturales más amplias en relación con la transcripción y el discurso académico, la complejidad de la equivalencia y el rol central del transcriptor situado...|$|R
