5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{investigation}} undertaken by the German General Staff following the sinking of Athenia, U-30 remained in port until 9 December 1939, when she was finally allowed to put to sea again for her second war patrol. It lasted only six days, during which time she travelled up to the southern coast <b>of</b> (<b>then</b> neutral) Norway before returning to Wilhelmshaven on 14 December 1939. During the voyage U-30 did not encounter any enemy vessels, consequently she returned to port without any claims.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1926, the American Association of State Highway Officials {{formally}} {{established the}} U.S. Highway System {{and many of the}} New England inter-state routes were redesignated as U.S. Routes. The portion of New England Route 14 from Barre to Burlington was assigned to U.S. Route 2, while the portion in New Hampshire was assigned to U.S. Route 4. This shortened Route 14 in the south to US 4/US 5 in White River Junction, and in the north to US 2 in the city of Barre. In 1935, the portion of US 2 between Montpelier and St. Johnsbury was relocated to a more northerly alignment using a section <b>of</b> <b>then</b> Vermont Route 18. The old US 2 alignment was redesignated as US 302. VT 14 was extended northward several miles to East Montpelier, ending at the junction of newly relocated US 2 and Vermont Route 12.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea {{have always}} worn blue shirts, {{although}} they originally used the paler eton blue, which {{was taken from}} the racing colours <b>of</b> <b>then</b> club president, Earl Cadogan, and was worn with white shorts and dark blue or black socks. The light blue shirts were replaced by a royal blue version in around 1912. In the 1960s Chelsea manager Tommy Docherty changed the kit again, switching to blue shorts (which have remained ever since) and white socks, believing it made the club's colours more modern and distinctive, since no other major side used that combination; this kit was first worn during the 1964–65 season. Since then Chelsea have always worn white socks with their home kit apart from a short spell from 1985 to 1992, when blue socks were reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{was given}} her name by President George Washington after a {{principle}} of the United States Constitution. Her keel was reportedly laid down late in 1795 at a shipyard in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. James Hackett was charged with her construction and Captain James Sever served as a superintendent. Her construction proceeded slowly and was completely suspended when in March 1796, a peace treaty was signed with Algiers. Congress remained at the shipyard, incomplete, until relations with France deteriorated in 1798 with {{the start of the}} Quasi-War. At the request <b>of</b> <b>then</b> President John Adams, funds were approved on 16 July to complete her construction.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, {{the local}} Republican {{committee}} nominated Coolidge for {{election to the}} state House of Representatives. He won a close victory over the incumbent Democrat, and reported to Boston for the 1907 session of the Massachusetts General Court. In his freshman term, Coolidge served on minor committees and, although he usually voted with the party, {{was known as a}} Progressive Republican, voting in favor of such measures as women's suffrage and the direct election of Senators. While in Boston, Coolidge became an ally, and then a liegeman, <b>of</b> <b>then</b> U.S. Senator Winthrop Murray Crane who controlled the western faction of the Massachusetts Republican Party; Crane's party rival in the east of the commonwealth was U.S. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge. Another key strategic alliance which Coolidge forged was with Guy Currier, who had served in both state houses and had the social distinction, wealth, personal charm and broad circle of friends which Coolidge lacked, and which would have a lasting impact on his political career. In 1907, he was elected to a second term, and in the 1908 session, Coolidge was more outspoken, though not in a leadership position.|$|E

Martel's team—Martel, the Glamour Girls, Dawn Marie, and Donna Christanello—lost to The Fabulous Moolah's team—Moolah, Velvet McIntyre, Rockin' Robin, and the Jumping Bomb Angels (Noriyo Tateno and Itsuki Yamazaki). Kai and Martin feuded in 1988 with Japanese imports the Jumping Bomb Angels for the Women's Tag Team Championship. The two teams staged a two out of three falls match at the first Royal Rumble event in 1988, with the Jumping Bomb Angels capturing the gold. Kai and Martin recaptured the title months later in June 1988 before the belts were once again abandoned in 1989 when the company lost interest in the women's division.|$|E

The commission ruled that Murphy had to either keep Lavender for one year, or return him to Providence.

Other investors include relatives of Daley's political adviser Timothy Degnan, two neighbors of the mayor, Ray Chin, an O'Hare Airport contractor, and Rick Simon, a controversial figure who runs a janitorial business {{and sits on the}} board of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau. Also among the investors was Daley's cousin Theresa E. Mintle, then the Chicago Transit Authority’s director of governmental affairs and former congressman Morgan F.

The project officially began with a publicized groundbreaking on October 18, 2010, and was originally scheduled to be completed by the first quarter of 2012. However, by February 2012, the station was just at 30% design phase, with track and signals to reach 30% design by late spring.

5|$|Since 1888, when Mahdist rebels {{forced the}} {{evacuation}} <b>of</b> <b>then</b> governor Emin Pasha, the Lado Enclave had been occupied by rebels {{under the leadership}} of Emir Arabi Dafalla. Rejaf was their strongest fortified position in the area, and it was there Arabi Dafalla stationed his equipment and soldiers. The establishment of Mahdist Sudan had provided the context for European powers to commence the invasion and colonization of the Sudan, in which King Leopold desperately wanted to take part in order to expand his Congolese empire. However, a direct military campaign into the area was not an option; Leopold {{would not have been able}} to get permission from either the French or the British according to the rules laid out in the 1884 Berlin Conference, especially considering both nations were looking to annex the Sudan themselves. King Leopold II therefore decided to disguise his campaign into the Sudan as an expeditionary force sent to reclaim the Lado Enclave from the Mahdists, although he inended to give his commanders covert orders to continue their advance far past the boundaries of Belgian territory, first to Fashoda and then on to Khartoum. After receiving a new loan of 6.5 million francs from the Belgian government in 1895, Leopold ordered preparations to be made for the execution of his plan.|$|E
5|$|St Petersburg {{academic}} psychiatrist professor Yuri Nuller {{notes that}} the concept of Snezhnevsky's school allowed psychiatrists to consider, for example, schizoid psychopathy and even schizoid character traits as early, delayed in their development, stages of the inevitable progredient process, rather than as personality traits inherent to the individual, the dynamics of which might depend on various external factors. The same also applied to a number of other personality disorders. It entailed the extremely broadened diagnostics of sluggish (neurosis-like, psychopathy-like) schizophrenia. Despite a number of its controversial premises and in line with the traditions <b>of</b> <b>then</b> Soviet science, Snezhnevsky's hypothesis has immediately acquired the status of dogma which was later overcome in other disciplines but firmly stuck in psychiatry. Snezhnevsky's concept, with its dogmatism, proved to be psychologically comfortable for many psychiatrists, relieving them from doubt when making a diagnosis. That carried a great danger: any deviation from a norm evaluated by a doctor could be regarded as an early phase of schizophrenia, with all ensuing consequences. It resulted in the broad opportunity for voluntary and involuntary abuses of psychiatry. But Snezhnevsky did not take civil and scientific courage to reconsider his concept which clearly reached a deadlock.|$|E
