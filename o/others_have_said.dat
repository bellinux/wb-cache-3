Neil Smith, {{and later}} {{writers such as}} Erika Holzer and Terry Goodkind {{have been influenced by}} her. Other artists who have cited Rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist Steve Ditko and musician Neil Peart of Rush. Rand provided a positive view of business, and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work. John Allison of BB and Ed Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rand's ideas, while Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, and John P. Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods, among <b>others,</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> they consider Rand crucial to their success.|$|E

25|$|<b>Others</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that Oz {{stands for}} New York, since {{the letters of}} the {{alphabet}} before O and Z are N and Y respectively. However, this works just as well with Oz standing for Pennsylvania, because the letters following O and Z are P and A (starting again {{at the beginning of the}} alphabet).|$|E

25|$|Some mythicists hold—in terms {{given by}} Robert M. Price—the Jesus agnosticism viewpoint, while others go further {{and hold the}} Jesus atheism viewpoint. Some {{scholars}} have {{made the case that}} there are a number of plausible Jesuses that could have existed, but that there can be no certainty as to which Jesus was the historical Jesus. <b>Others</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that Jesus may have lived far earlier, in a dimly remembered remote past. A number of writers adduce various arguments to show that Christianity has syncretistic or mythical roots. As such, the historical Jesus should not be regarded as the founder of the religion, even if he did exist.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} the switch in {{strategy}} is disputed. Some historians argue the change in strategy lost the Luftwaffe the opportunity of winning the air battle, or air superiority. Others argue the Luftwaffe achieved little in the air battle and the RAF {{was not on the}} verge of collapse, as often claimed. Another perspective has also been put forward, which suggests the Germans could not have gained air superiority before the weather window closed. <b>Others</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that it was unlikely the Luftwaffe would ever be able to destroy RAF Fighter Command. If British losses became severe, the RAF could simply have withdrawn northward and regrouped. It could then deploy when, or if, the Germans launched an invasion. Most historians agree Sea Lion would have failed regardless, because of the weaknesses of German sea power compared to the Royal Navy.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} {{has also been}} criticized as unrealistic, with Yuri K. and Victor not receiving the homophobic abuse they would experience in real life. <b>Others</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that some viewers refused to acknowledge the relationship because the homosexuality was not explicit. Although the [...] "kiss" [...] is obscured by Victor's arm, it is implicit. Cecilia D'Anastasio of Kotaku wondered why the [...] "kiss" [...] was blocked when other anime, such as Shin Sekai Yori, had depicted gay kisses.|$|E

500|$|Governor Jim McGreevey had {{announced}} {{the appointment of}} Newark-born poet Amiri Baraka (1934–2014) as the state's second poet laureate on August 28, 2002 although his selection was expected at least two months earlier. Baraka, born Everett Leroy Jones, is an African-American poet, playwright, and author of fiction, essays and music criticism. Baraka's poetry and writing has attracted both acclaim and condemnation. Within the African-American community, critics compare him to James Baldwin and call Baraka {{one of the most}} respected and most widely published Black writers of his generation. <b>Others</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that his work often ventures into expressions of violence, racism, homophobia, and misogyny—particularly his advocacy of rape, hate, and violence towards women, homosexuals, Caucasians, and Jews.|$|E
500|$|The Indian Princess is {{also one}} of the first American plays to call itself a “melo-drame” (or melodrama) which {{literally}} is French for “play with music.” [...] Like the French and German melodramas typical of the period, the score contained open-ended snippets of background mood music that can be repeated as much as necessary to heighten the sentimentality of the drama, although some have argued that it bears no other resemblance to the typical French melodrama of the period. Still <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that the categorization of the piece as a melodrama is accurate, considering the play’s portrayal of the genre’s typical persecuted heroine (Pocahontas), villainous antagonists (Miami and Grimosco), virtuous hero (Smith), and comic relief (Robin and others).|$|E
500|$|Wullschlager {{observes that}} in [...] "The Princess and the Pea" [...] Andersen blended his {{childhood}} {{memories of a}} primitive world of violence, death, and inexorable fate, with his social climber's private romance about the serene, secure and cultivated Danish bourgeoisie, which did not quite accept {{him as one of}} their own. Researcher Jack Zipes said that Andersen, during his lifetime, [...] "was obliged to act as a dominated subject within the dominant social circles despite his fame and recognition as a writer"; Andersen therefore developed a feared and loved view of the aristocracy. <b>Others</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that Andersen constantly felt as though he did not belong, and longed {{to be a part of}} the upper class. The nervousness and humiliations Andersen suffered in the presence of the bourgeoisie were mythologized by the storyteller in the tale of [...] "The Princess and the Pea", with Andersen himself the morbidly sensitive princess who can feel a pea through 20mattresses.|$|E

500|$|Reaction to the Master Chief as a {{character}} is mixed. Some reviewers see the character's silent nature as a strength; <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that this quality leaves him insufficiently developed and not believable. UGO ranked the Master Chief at number eight on its 2007 list of top heroes of all time", ahead of fellow video game characters Samus Aran, Link, and Gordon Freeman. In 2009, GameDaily listed the [...] "strong and silent type" [...] among top 25 video game archetypes, using Master Chief as an example. Master Chief was also ranked number eight in Empires list of the greatest video game characters. In 2009, GamesRadar included him among the 25 best new characters of the decade. UGO listed Master Chief's [...] "trademark" [...] helmet in its 2011 list of the coolest helmets and headgear in video games. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the eight [...] "most memorable, influential, and badass" [...] protagonist in games, commenting: [...] "Chief isn't the strongest or most crafty hero, and he isn't particularly charismatic or intelligent or playful. But when civilization {{is on the line}} and all other options have been exhausted, Chief is the guy who's going to get you through." [...] In 2013, Complex ranked him as the second greatest soldier in video games.|$|E
2500|$|The huge score led Steve Waugh to {{say that}} 500 in an innings is the next possibility. <b>Others</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that scores like this are bad for the sport, with Barry Richards saying, [...] "There is such a {{propensity}} for hitting boundaries that bowlers have {{been taken out of}} game".|$|E

2500|$|The dictator's {{last words}} {{are not known}} with certainty, and are a contested subject among {{scholars}} and historians alike.

2500|$|The Industrial Revolution marks a major {{turning point}} in history; {{almost every aspect of}} daily life was {{influenced}} in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. [...] Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently {{for the first time in}} history, although <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E
2500|$|Hurling {{has been}} played in Wexford from medieval times. Evidence {{of this can}} be found in the hurling ballads of the 15th and 16th centuries. The {{nickname}} [...] "Yellowbellies" [...] is said to have been given to the county's hurlers by Sir Caesar Colclough of Tintern in south Wexford, following a 17th-century game between a team of hurlers under his patronage and a team of hurlers from Cornwall, near Glynn in county Wexford. <b>Others</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that King George III shouted [...] "come on the yellow bellies" [...] at an exhibition match near London, in which the Wexford hurlers were wearing yellow ribbons.|$|E

2500|$|The {{statements}} {{fall into}} two categories: using civilian structures like homes, mosques and hospitals to store munitions in or launch rockets from, and urging or forcing civilian population {{to stay in their}} homes, to shield militants. Israeli soldiers have also said Hamas operatives directly employed women and children as involuntary human shields to evade pursuit, while Hamas and <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> such accusations are false. Asa Kasher, who helped to write the Israel Defense Forces's Code of Conduct, argued that [...] "Israel cannot forfeit its ability to protect its citizens against attacks simply because terrorists hide behind non-combatants. If it did so, it would be giving up any right to self-defense." ...|$|E
2500|$|Holocaust {{historian}} Kenneth Waltzer {{said that}} it was disturbing that so few people had noticed and inquired about the obvious holes in his history over a decade of time. Waltzer and <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that Rosenblat didn't need to embellish his story, which was already powerful enough by itself. Waltzer places part of the blame in all those [...] "culture makers" [...] that profited from the diffusion of the story and never doubted even the most implausible parts of it. It appears that the veracity of story was not questioned either by the book publisher or by Oprah Winfrey, and that no fact-checking was done to ensure the authenticity of the memoir prior to endorsing it soundly.|$|E
2500|$|The {{similarity}} of the 216 gigantic faces on the temple's towers to other statues {{of the king}} has led many scholars {{to the conclusion that}} the faces are representations of Jayavarman VII (...) himself. <b>Others</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that the faces belong to the bodhisattva of compassion called Avalokitesvara or Lokesvara. [...] The two hypotheses need not be regarded as mutually exclusive. Angkor scholar George Coedès has theorized that Jayavarman stood squarely in the tradition of the Khmer monarchs in thinking of himself as a [...] "devaraja" [...] (god-king), the salient difference being that while his predecessors were Hindus and regarded themselves as consubstantial with Shiva and his symbol the lingam, Jayavarman as a Buddhist identified himself with the Buddha and the bodhisattva.|$|E
