Eisenhower as the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in June 1952, General Matthew Ridgway of the United Nations Command was transferred from Korea to Europe as Eisenhower's replacement. The United States Army appointed General Mark Wayne Clark, commander of the US Fifth Army during World War II, to overall command <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula</b> {{as a replacement for}} Ridgway.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the Korean War broke out, {{prompting}} the United States {{to intervene in}} the name of the United Nations. President Truman was caught off guard when the invasion struck, but quickly ordered U.S. forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also sent U.S.-based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization Missouri was called up from the Atlantic Fleet and dispatched from Norfolk on 19 August to support UN forces <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> <b>peninsula.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army {{also contributed}} {{troops to the}} British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan. Volunteers for this force were {{recruited}} in late 1945, with most being assigned to three new infantry battalions: the 65th Battalion was formed from volunteers from the 7th Division, the 66th Battalion by men from the 6th Division and the 67th from 9th Division personnel. These and other units were grouped at Morotai as the 34th Brigade in October 1945. The brigade's departure for Japan was delayed until February 1946 by inter-Allied negotiations, but it eventually took over responsibility for enforcing {{the terms of the}} Japanese surrender in Hiroshima Prefecture. The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949, and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December 1948, forming the basis of the post-war Regular Army. From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under-strength battalion. Australian forces remained until September 1951 when the BCOF ceased operations, although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> <b>peninsula</b> following the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950.|$|E

5|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war period Australia contributed significant {{forces to the}} Allied occupation of Japan {{as part of the}} British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF), which included forces from Australia, Britain, India and New Zealand. At its height in 1946 the Australian component consisted of an infantry brigade, four warships and three fighter squadrons, totalling 13,500 personnel. The Australian Army component initially consisted of the 34th Brigade which arrived in Japan in February 1946 and was based in Hiroshima Prefecture. The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949, and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December 1948, forming the basis of the post-war Regular Army.

However, by 1950 only No. 77 Squadron remained in Japan. A total of ten RAN warships served in Japan during this period, including HMA Ships Australia, Hobart, Shropshire, Arunta, Bataan, Culgoa, Murchison, Shoalhaven, Quadrant and Quiberon, while HMAS Ships Manoora, Westralia and Kanimbla also provided support.|$|E

40|$|Assuming {{there is}} another North <b>Korean</b> invasion; could <b>the</b> South <b>Koreans</b> counterinvade North Korea and prevail even without the United States' assistance? This paper studies the {{possibility}} of a South Korean counterinvasion against North Korea by looking at the qualitative combat dynamics and performing a formal campaign analyses based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> <b>peninsula's</b> conventional military balance. This study first analyzes the process of <b>the</b> South <b>Korean</b> defensive against <b>the</b> North <b>Korean</b> invasion, and examines South Korea's likely counterinvasion scenarios and assesses their chances of success. These scenarios vary based on North Korea's likely courses of action once its offensive fails, depending <b>on</b> whether <b>the</b> North <b>Koreans</b> retreat to <b>the</b> military demarcation line or hold their position within the South territory. According to this paper's analysis, South Korea is capable of counterinvading North Korea in all the scenarios suggested. South Korea possesses a qualitatively superior force with better readiness and logistics powered by a stronger economy, while <b>the</b> North <b>Koreans</b> lack <b>the</b> force effectiveness necessary to carry out their theory of victory. First, <b>the</b> South <b>Korean</b> forces are capable of fending off a North Korean invasion while inflicting severe damage to the North Koreans; second, <b>the</b> South <b>Korean</b> forces would inflict considerable casualty to <b>the</b> North <b>Koreans</b> during their retreat; finally, <b>the</b> South <b>Korean</b> offensive would be capable of breaking through <b>the</b> weakened North <b>Korean</b> defense. This study makes several contributions. First, it examines the puzzle of South Korean counterinvasion that has been under-discussed despite its political and strategic significance. In doing so, the study presents an opportunity to explain North Korea's recent behaviors and the United States' redefinition of its role involving the peninsula, hence increasing our understanding of the East Asian security dynamics. Second, by providing an updated survey of the peninsula's conventional balance, this study enhances our knowledge in the two Korea's strategic capabilities which have undergone considerable changes. Third, this study advances our usage of campaign analyses by applying a phased use of the models with changing parameters. This approach enables us to analyze multi-phased campaigns comprised of different dynamics with better accuracy. by Jonghyuk Chung. Thesis (S. M.)

Phylogeographic analyses revealed region-specific haplotype groupings combined with overall low levels of inter-regional genetic divergence. Despite the enormous intervening distance, European and East Asian samples showed a net nucleotide divergence of only 0. 36 %. Based on an evolutionary rate for the cytochrome b gene of 2. 4 %(.)

The molecular data further suggest that recolonization occurred from refugia in the Central to East Asian region. Japanese haplotypes of M. minutus, with the exception of those from Tsushima Is., show limited nucleotide diversity (0. 15 %) compared with those found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> adjacent <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> This finding suggests recent colonization of the Japanese Archipelago, probably around the last glacial period, followed by rapid population growth...|$|R
