Abnormalities include verbosity, abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance, use <b>of</b> <b>metaphor</b> meaningful {{only to the}} speaker, auditory perception deficits, unusually pedantic, formal or idiosyncratic speech, and oddities in loudness, pitch, intonation, prosody, and rhythm.

5|$|Chabon's work is {{characterized}} by complex language, the frequent use <b>of</b> <b>metaphor</b> along with recurring themes, including nostalgia, divorce, abandonment, fatherhood, and most notably issues of Jewish identity. He often includes gay, bisexual, and Jewish characters in his work. Since the late 1990s, Chabon has written in an increasingly diverse series of styles for varied outlets; he is a notable defender of the merits of genre fiction and plot-driven fiction, and, along with novels, he has published screenplays, children's books, comics, and newspaper serials.|$|E
5|$|Roa Bastos was an {{exponent}} of the Neobaroque {{style that}} brought Latin American literature {{to the fore}} internationally in the mid-20th century. Among others, the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda is also associated with this school of writing. The style uses a complex system of metaphors that are often very {{closely tied to the}} land, flora and culture of the particular writer, {{especially in the case of}} Roa Bastos. Magic realism is a Neobaroque concept that applies such systems <b>of</b> <b>metaphor</b> to otherwise realistic settings (Yo, el Supremo being a notable example of the form). The Neobaroque style was used by many Paraguayan writers in exile after 1947 and until the 1980s. At the core of much of the work from this group are ideas of political freedom and the emancipation of their homeland.|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} a comparative analysis <b>of</b> understand-ing a <b>metaphor</b> by O. Freudenberg and M. Bakhtin {{in the context}} of the cognitive nature of this phenomenon identi-fied by metaphorology. The basis for affiliating metaphors to philosophical concepts is the formation of metaphorolo-gy. The nature of the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>metaphors</b> continues to raise debates; thus in philosophy metaphor is presented quite different than in literature. At the same time, the cog-nitive nature <b>of</b> <b>metaphors</b> gave rise to rethinking the met-aphors in contemporary philosophy. The {{article presents}} different definitions <b>of</b> a <b>metaphor</b> as a basis for verifying the cognitive side <b>of</b> <b>metaphors.</b> Due to the identified epis-temological orientation, the article highlights the under-standings <b>of</b> <b>metaphors</b> according to O. Freudenberg and M. Bakhtin. The concept <b>of</b> <b>metaphors</b> according to Freudenberg is considered {{in the context of}} her interest in the structure of archaic thinking and the role of language in the development of human society in its early phases. Un-derstanding <b>of</b> <b>metaphors</b> according to M. Bakhtin is built on active assessments of the phenomena of reality and bears the features constituting the world picture. Based on the comparative analysis, the article shows that O. Freudenberg and M.

This paper attempts to highlight {{an overview of}} their presence {{as seen from the}} aspect of ESL reading comprehension by a group of selected respondents.

The impact and application of the roles played by metaphors and symbols have been greatly used by writers.

Using open-ended questions, the responses of respondents regarding the usage and influence <b>of</b> <b>metaphors</b> and symbols in an ESL reading comprehension class were analysed.
