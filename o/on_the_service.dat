5|$|Beginning with Rag Doll Kung Fu in October 2005, {{third-party}} games {{became available}} for purchase and download on Steam, and Valve announced that Steam had become profitable because of some highly successful Valve games. Although digital distribution could not yet match retail volume, profit margins for Valve and developers were far larger on Steam. Large developer-publishers, including id Software, Eidos Interactive, and Capcom, began distributing their games on Steam in 2007. By May that year, 13million accounts had been created <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> and 150 games were for sale on the platform.|$|E
5|$|Canon William Lummis, MC, was a {{military}} historian who built up an archive <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> records and final resting places of Victoria Cross holders. This was then summarised into a pamphlet which was taken to be an authoritative source on these matters. However, Lummis was aware of short-comings in his work and encouraged David Harvey to continue it. The result was Harvey's seminal book Monuments to Courage. In 2007 the Royal Mail used material from Lummis' archives to produce a collection of stamps commemorating Victoria Cross recipients.|$|E
5|$|Several game {{websites}} {{were outraged}} at Nintendo's decision. Though disappointed with Nintendo's decision, McMillen {{did not think}} {{the loss of the}} 3DS port was a major issue, and saw a brief sales burst on Steam as the news was covered in gaming website. McMillen further praised the flexibility of the Steam platform, which does not require games to obtain ESRB ratings to be published <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> and the freedom it gave to the publishers regardless of the game content.|$|E

5|$|Steam's {{primary service}} {{is to allow}} its users to {{download}} games and other software {{that they have in}} their virtual software libraries to their local computers as game cache files (GCFs). Initially, Valve was required to be the publisher for these titles since they had sole access to the Steam's database and engine, but with the introduction of the Steamworks software development kit (SDK) in May 2008, anyone could potentially become a publisher to Steam, outside of Valve's involvement to curate titles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Five Nights at Freddy's {{games have}} proven popular {{to be played}} by video {{streamers}} to their audience, so as to capture the players' jump scares and other frightened reactions, becoming a common game for Let's Play videos. Popular video streamers such as PewDiePie, Markiplier, and Jacksepticeye helped the games to receive additional attention through their playthroughs. In May 2015, YouTube reported that playthroughs of the Five Nights at Freddy's series were the eighth most-watched of all video game series <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E

The service industries include public sector employment, health, education, finance, information technology (IT) and tourism that accounts for 10.7% of employment. Tourism has become {{an important element of}} the economy, with the city offering a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural activities. In 2009, York was the 7th most visited city by UK residents and the 13th most visited by overseas visitors.|$|E
5|$|According to Yoichi Wada, then-CEO of Square Enix, XIV {{was being}} planned {{as a serious}} rival to {{successful}} western MMORPG World of Warcraft. The game was developed primarily for Windows, and was then ported across to PS3. XIV was originally scheduled for simultaneous release on Windows and PS3 in 2010, but the PS3 version was delayed into 2011. This was explained as due to it taking longer than expected to make the adjustments needed so the game could fit within the console's limited memory. The game {{did not use the}} PlayOnline service used for XI. This was explained as being due to the marked decrease of content <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> Instead, they would migrate to a new service that still allowed cross-platform gameplay, including the use of a universal Square Enix ID that would allow players to play from wherever they left off. In October 2009, the game's Beta release was announced as being only for Windows. First print runs of the PS3 version of Final Fantasy XIII contained a bonus code for the PS3 version of XIV for a special in-game item.|$|E
5|$|Geilo Airport {{was opened}} in 1985 as a {{regional}} airport. On 20 June 1986, Coast Aero Center was awarded the concession for flying from Stavanger to Geilo Airport, Dagali until 1991. The airline used a Beechcraft 200 Super King Air <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> At the same time, Norving started operations to Oslo. The ridership from Geilo {{turned out to be}} insufficient to make a profit, and both Coast Aero Center and Norving terminated their routes. Wider√∏e and Norsk Air said there was not enough ridership for them to be interested. In 1989, Coast Air received a one-year concession to operate from Geilo to Oslo and Stavanger. The company used de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft. The service was soon limited to two round trips each week.|$|E
40|$|This {{position}} paper investigates {{the possibilities of}} separation, modularization and reuse offered by aspect-orientation, concentrating not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> technical or syntactic problems, but <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inherent issues resulting from interaspect dependencies. An aspect is defined based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> it provides, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> it requires and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> it removes from other aspects. A classification of aspects is established based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way they {{interact with each other}} and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way their functionality is triggered. Composition rules and the weavability criteria are defined based on this classification. Moreover, the impact of the dependencies of aspects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> level of achievable reuse is analyzed. Finally, the paper shows how the general ideas apply to the aspect-oriented programming environment AspectJ...|$|R

5|$|In 1894, {{while serving}} as torpedo officer on the depot ship , Scott learned of the {{financial}} calamity that had overtaken his family. John Scott, having sold the brewery and invested the proceeds unwisely, had lost all his capital and was now virtually bankrupt. At the age of 63, and in poor health, {{he was forced to}} take a job as a brewery manager and move his family to Shepton Mallet, Somerset. Three years later, while Robert was serving with the Channel squadron flagship , John Scott died of heart disease, creating a fresh family crisis. Hannah Scott and her two unmarried daughters now relied entirely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> pay of Scott and the salary of younger brother Archie, who had left the army for a higher-paid post in the colonial service. Archie's own death in the autumn of 1898, after contracting typhoid fever, meant that the whole financial responsibility for the family rested on Scott.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, WWV {{was nearly}} shut down. Its signal could only cover {{the eastern half}} of the United States, and other {{stations}} located in Minneapolis and at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were slowly making WWV redundant. The station's impending shutdown was announced in 1926, but it was saved by a flood of protests from citizens who relied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> Later, in 1931, WWV underwent an upgrade. Its transmitter, now directly controlled by a quartz oscillator, was moved to College Park, Maryland. Broadcasts began on 5MHz. A year later, the station was moved again, to Department of Agriculture land in Beltsville, Maryland. Broadcasts were added on 10 and 15MHz, power was increased, and time signals, an A440 tone, and ionosphere reports were all added to the broadcast in June 1937.|$|E
5|$|In June 2009, Square Enix {{announced}} {{they had decided}} not to use PlayOnline for Final Fantasy XIV due to the marked decrease of content <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> Instead, they would migrate to a new service that still allowed cross-platform gameplay, including the use of a universal Square Enix ID that would allow players to play from wherever they left off. In June 2011, Square Enix announced that they would merge the account management portion of the PlayOnline service into Square Enix accounts from July 2011 and culminate on August 31, 2011. However, PlayOnline is still required in order to actually play Final Fantasy XI. Square Enix replicated the idea of the friends list from Final Fantasy XI in Final Fantasy XIV. The termination date of service for Final Fantasy XI and PlayOnline for PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 was March 2016.|$|E

5|$|Officials at {{the court}} of Emperor Ai of Han (r. 7‚Äì1 BC) {{attempted}} to implement reforms limiting the amount of land nobles and wealthy landowners could own legally, but were unsuccessful. When Wang Mang {{took control of the}} government in 9 AD, he abolished the purchase and sale of land in a system called King's Fields (ÁéãÁî∞). This was a variation of the well-field system, where the government owned the land and assured every peasant an equal share to cultivate. Within three years, complaints from wealthy landowners and nobles forced Wang Mang to repeal the reform. After Gengshi (r. 23‚Äì25 AD) and Guangwu (r. 25‚Äì57 AD) restored the Han dynasty, they relied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> of great landholding families to secure their position in society. Many of their government officials also became wealthy landowners.|$|E
5|$|Since the 20th century {{there has}} been {{significant}} population movement to England, mostly {{from other parts of}} the British Isles, but also from the Commonwealth, particularly the Indian subcontinent. Since the 1970s {{there has been}} a large move away from manufacturing and an increasing emphasis <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> industry. As part of the United Kingdom, the area joined a common market initiative called the European Economic Community which became the European Union. Since the late 20th century the administration of the United Kingdom has moved towards devolved governance in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. England and Wales continues to exist as a jurisdiction within the United Kingdom. Devolution has stimulated a greater emphasis on a more English-specific identity and patriotism. There is no devolved English government, but an attempt to create a similar system on a sub-regional basis was rejected by referendum.|$|E

A website entitled TrekUnited.com was set up to raise funds for a fifth season, but failed to do so with the money refunded after the unsuccessful campaign. A total of $32 million had been raised. Several years later, the possibility of a fifth season was still being discussed with Braga suggesting that fans could prompt Netflix into producing a new season of Enterprise by watching the existing four seasons <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> This resulted in a Facebook campaign set up to promote the idea of a fifth season.|$|E

5|$|The {{heavy rains}} caused {{two people to}} drown in Charlotte. A girl drowned after being swept into a creek, and a woman drowned while in her car. Also in North Carolina, {{tropical}} rains related to Danny caused a CSX train to derail from its trestle into Little Sugar Creek, spilling about 2,500 gallons (9,500L) of diesel and therefore forcing a nearby public housing development to be evacuated. Sustained tropical-storm force winds affected Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket Island, and parts of Cape Cod, {{in addition to the}} coastal waters from the entrance of Buzzards Bay to the south and east of Cape Cod. Only minor damage occurred, despite these strong winds, which were experienced primarily in southeastern Massachusetts. The minor damage included localized flooding, power outages, downed tree limbs, and lost boats. A suspension of ferry service to Nantucket Island occurred for most of July 25, with a shorter suspension happening <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> to Martha's Vineyard. No significant coastal flooding affected the region, although a storm shelter was opened on Nantucket Island to host a Boy Scout group camping there. Danny was the fifth tropical cyclone to affect Southern New England in the 20th century during the month of July.|$|E
5|$|The initial process {{offered by}} Steam Greenlight was panned because while {{developers}} favored the concept, {{the rate of}} games that are eventually approved by Valve is very small. At the time, Valve acknowledged {{that this was a}} problem and believed it could be improved upon it. In January 2013, Newell stated that Valve recognized that its role in Greenlight was perceived as a bottleneck, something the company was planning to eliminate in the future through an open marketplace infrastructure. On the eve of Greenlight's first anniversary, Valve simultaneously approved 100 titles through the Greenlight process to demonstrate this change of direction. While the Greenlight service had helped to bring more and varied games onto Steam without excessive bureaucracy, it also led to an excessively large number of games <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> that make it difficult for a single title to stand out, and as early as 2014, Valve had discussed plans to phase out the Greenlight process in favor of providing developers with easier means to put their games onto the Steam service.|$|E
5|$|When One Meridian Plaza {{was built}} Philadelphia was {{enforcing}} a building code from 1949 that made {{no distinction between}} high-rises and other buildings.
