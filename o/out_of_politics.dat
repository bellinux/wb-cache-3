5|$|In 2015, the Daily Telegraph {{reported}} that a prisoner serving a 27-year sentence was conducting a lone protest on the roof against conditions and was being cheered by other prisoners. The newspaper also referenced in its own report an interview with former lord chief justice Lord Woolf from {{earlier in the year}} where he described prisoners being kept in intolerable conditions–as bad as {{at the time of the}} riots. Woolf recommended prisons were kept <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 4 May 2012 Livingstone was {{defeated}} in the London 2012 Mayoral Elections by the incumbent Mayor, Boris Johnson.

5|$|While <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics,</b> Getty {{became the}} head of an {{investment}} firm and sat on the boards of a number of corporations, including the Royal Bank of Canada and Celanese Canada. However, when Lougheed stepped down from the Progressive Conservative leadership in 1985, Getty entered the contest to replace him and immediately became the favourite. At an October convention, Getty won a second ballot victory against Minister of Municipal Affairs Julian Koziak and former legislator Ron Ghitter.|$|E
5|$|Once <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics,</b> Rutherford {{returned}} to his law practice. His partnership with Jamieson saw partners come and go. Rutherford divided his time between the original Strathcona office and the Edmonton office he opened in 1910; his practice focussed on contracts, real estate, wills and estates, and incorporations. In 1923, Rutherford's son Cecil joined the firm along with Stanley Harwood McCuaig, who in 1919 would marry Rutherford's daughter Hazel. In 1925, Jamieson left the partnership to establish his own firm. In 1939, McCuaig did the same. Cecil's partnership with his father continued until the latter's death.|$|E
5|$|Tydings {{resumed his}} legal career after {{he lost his}} Senate seat, {{entering}} into practice with a Washington law firm that included Giant Food President Joseph Danzansky. After several years <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics,</b> he began traveling the state in 1975 to gauge his chances for winning a rematch versus Beall, who was coming up for re-election in 1976. On January 10, 1976, Tydings announced his candidacy to retake the seat, which he argued was taken unfairly in 1970 due to an undisclosed $180,000 gift to the Beall campaign.|$|E

5|$|Cameron {{was one of}} six {{candidates}} {{elected as}} aldermen to Edmonton's first town council in 1892; he received the fifth most votes of the fourteen candidates. He was defeated in his 1893 re-election bid, in which he finished seventh of nine candidates. He briefly returned to the council after being elected again in 1895, but did not seek re-election the following year and remained <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> thereafter. During his first term on the council, {{he was involved in}} an altercation in which the dominion government had made a decision to Dominion Land Office from Edmonton to Strathcona, at the time a separate town, south of the North Saskatchewan River. When news of the decision and crews to execute it arrived in Edmonton, angry citizens descended on the office and tore to pieces the wagon that the officer was packing with records for transportation. Led by mayor Matthew McCauley, Cameron was {{part of a group of}} prominent citizens that headed the resistance, eventually leading to the dominion reversing its decision.|$|E
5|$|During his term, Crittenden {{remained}} {{an outspoken critic}} of Jackson and his successor, Martin Van Buren. He supported Henry Clay's plan for distributing proceeds from the sale of public lands among the states, and also joined Clay in opposing the administration-backed Second Seminole War. One of the few administration proposals he supported was the recognition of the new Republic of Texas. During this period of Crittenden's service in the Senate, the issue of slavery rose to prominence. Crittenden was regarded as a moderate on the issue, seeking to keep it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> altogether. In 1836, he resisted petitions by the Quakers to abolish slavery in Washington, D.C., but he also opposed radical pro-slavery measures such as John C. Calhoun's proposal to ban abolitionist literature from being delivered by mail in the Southern states.|$|E
5|$|Gallagher first sought {{public office}} in 1893, {{when he was}} elected to Edmonton Town Council. In an {{aldermanic}} race in which the top six candidates were elected, he gained the final spot. On his first term on council he sat on the Licensing, and Health & Relief committees. He was re-elected in 1894, again placing sixth of nine candidates. Once this term expired in 1896, Gallagher stayed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> for several months until mayor Herbert Charles Wilson resigned over a dispute involving town funds. It fell to the council to fill the mayor's position. Gallagher was nominated by John Cameron and John Kelly; as there were no rival candidates, he won by acclamation. He was the first mayor of Edmonton never to be elected to that position; (Frederick John Mitchell and Terry Cavanagh would later join him in that distinction). He was sworn in at the town council meeting on October 27, 1896.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{hoped to}} remain <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> {{in order to}} pay off the debts he had {{incurred}} during the Panic, but when the Republican state convention nominated him for governor in 1875, he accepted. The campaign against Democratic nominee William Allen focused primarily on Protestant fears of the possibility of state aid to Catholic schools. Hayes was against such funding and, while he was not known to be personally anti-Catholic, he allowed anti-Catholic fervor to contribute to the enthusiasm for his candidacy. The campaign was a success, and Hayes was returned to the governorship by a 5,544-vote majority. The first person to earn a third term as Governor of Ohio, Hayes reduced the state debt, re-established the Board of Charities, and repealed the Geghan Bill, which had allowed for the appointment of Catholic priests to schools and penitentiaries.|$|E
5|$|In January 1979, Nyerere mobilised the Tanzania People's Defence Force and counterattacked, {{joined by}} several groups of Ugandan exiles who had united as the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA). Amin's army retreated steadily, and, despite {{military}} help from Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, Amin {{was forced to}} flee into exile by helicopter on 11 April 1979, when Kampala was captured. He escaped first to Libya, where he stayed until 1980, and ultimately settled in Saudi Arabia, where the Saudi royal family allowed him sanctuary and paid him a generous subsidy in return for his staying <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics.</b> Amin lived {{for a number of}} years on the top two floors of the Novotel Hotel on Palestine Road in Jeddah. Brian Barron, who covered the Uganda–Tanzania war for the BBC as chief Africa correspondent, together with cameraman Mohamed Amin (no relation) of Visnews in Nairobi, located Amin in 1980, and secured the first interview with him since his deposition.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{retired from}} public life after resigning as Secretary of State. Except for one day, Sherman {{had spent the}} {{previous}} forty-two years, four months, and twenty-two days in government service. He gave a few interviews in which he disagreed with the administration's policy of annexing Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Later that year, his wife, Margaret, had a stroke; she died two years later on June 5, 1900. Sherman continued to alternate between houses in Mansfield and Washington. He mostly remained <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics,</b> except for a letter he wrote endorsing George K. Nash for Governor of Ohio in 1899. Sherman died at his Washington home on October 22, 1900, {{in the company of}} his daughter, relatives and friends. After a funeral at St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington, he was interred in Mansfield City Cemetery with his wife.|$|E

5|$|After {{a decade}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics,</b> Willis was chosen without {{opposition}} as the Republican gubernatorial nominee in 1943. Infighting among the state's Democrats combined with Willis's popular proposal {{to eliminate the}} state income tax carried him to a narrow victory over J. Lyter Donaldson. Willis was opposed by Democratic majorities {{in both houses of}} the Kentucky General Assembly. The end of World War II in 1945 brought sizable budget surpluses to the state, and disagreements over how to spend the excess funds spilled over into special legislative sessions. Willis was not able to realize his campaign promise of eliminating the state income tax because the legislature expanded the budget far beyond what he proposed. Nevertheless, he was able to forge a record of modest accomplishments, including constructing five tuberculosis hospitals across the state and significantly increasing funding for education. Following his term as governor, he served on various state boards and commissions, but failed in his only attempt to return to elective officea 1952 campaign against Bert T. Combs to return to the Court of Appeals. Willis died on April 1, 1965, and is interred at Frankfort Cemetery in the capital city of Frankfort.|$|E
5|$|The Whig Party {{was also}} divided in Kentucky, not only between Clay and Taylor, but between gubernatorial candidates. William J. Graves, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> since his fatal {{shooting}} of Representative Cilley, had {{the backing of}} sitting Whig governor William Owsley, while Archibald Dixon had secured support from former Whig governor Robert P. Letcher. Letcher wrote to Crittenden that a Whig split and Democratic victory in the gubernatorial election would have an injurious effect on Whig hopes of carrying Kentucky in the 1848 presidential election; another former Whig governor, Thomas Metcalfe, concurred. At the Whig nominating convention, both Graves and Dixon withdrew their names and a delegate from Logan County put forward Crittenden's name without his consent. The nomination easily carried before Crittenden's friends could block it. The governorship was less prestigious and paid less than Crittenden's position in the Senate. He {{would also have to}} abandon his growing legal practice before the Supreme Court and would lose input on national issues of importance to him such as the territorial questions that grew out of the Mexican War. Nevertheless, he believed that his candidacy would unite the Whigs and help Taylor win Kentucky's electoral votes in the general election. He accepted the nomination a week after it was made.|$|E
