5|$|After the {{contestant}} decides {{for which}} amount to play, the prize money is {{displayed on the}} gameboard. The contestant and chaser are presented with the same multiple choice question, and each locks in their answer, which cannot then be changed; the other has five seconds to answer after them, otherwise they are locked out and do not advance on the gameboard. For each question the contestant answers correctly, the prize money shown on the gameboard moves <b>one</b> <b>step</b> closer to the team bank. Similarly, the chaser moves <b>one</b> <b>step</b> closer to the contestant's prize money with each correct answer. Further questions are asked until the contestant reaches {{the end of the}} board (thus banking the prize money), or the chaser catches the contestant, eliminating them from the game. No movement is made by the contestant or the chaser if an incorrect answer is provided or if they are locked out by the time limit.|$|E
5|$|European {{dominance}} was at {{the forefront}} of United's agenda during the 1997–98 season. Having failed to take their chances in a semi-final against eventual champions Borussia Dortmund in 1996–97, Ferguson was resolute to go <b>one</b> <b>step</b> further and emulate Matt Busby's success of 1968, quashing any talk that his team was not good enough.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of the Manners, Etal Castle was managed by the Collingwood family, who {{gradually}} became the castle's hereditary constables, renting the demesne lands on the estate from the family as well. The castle was heavily involved in the border wars with Scotland, usually holding a garrison of 100 men and forming an important strategic defensive location, <b>one</b> <b>step</b> removed from the fortifications along the border itself.|$|E

5|$|The lack {{of skilled}} craftspeople in Northumberland made the {{construction}} of the house difficult. For example, Richardson speculates that the main staircase was assembled from a kit. It is <b>one</b> <b>step</b> too short for the Northumberland hallway, but no extra step was added to finish off the symmetry of the stairwell, suggesting a dearth of skilled labor.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{works on}} the pyramid of Neferefre had just begun when Neferefre died {{unexpectedly}} in his early twenties. At the time of Nyuserre's ascension to the throne, only <b>one</b> <b>step</b> of the core of Neferefre's pyramid had been completed. The substructures, built in a large open pit {{at the center of}} the pyramid were possibly unfinished as well. Nyuserre hastily completed the pyramid by transforming it into a stylised primeval mound resembling a mastaba: the walls of the core layer already in place were covered with limestone and the top was filled with clay and stones drawn from the local desert.|$|E
5|$|From 28 October 2002 to 16 August 2003, {{a musical}} based on Madness songs, Our House, ran at the Cambridge Theatre in London. Madness {{played a role}} in the {{executive}} production of the show, and Suggs {{played a role in}} the production for a period, playing the central character's father. It won an Olivier Award for best new musical of 2003, and the performance was released on DVD on 1 November 2004. There was also a previous musical based on Madness songs, <b>One</b> <b>Step</b> Beyond!, written by Alan Gilbey. The musical had a brief run at the Theatre Royal Stratford East in 1993 and a run at Putney Arts Theatre, London in 2012.|$|E

5|$|Once the {{cyclization}} has occurred, an oxyallyl cation is formed. As discussed extensively above, {{the typical}} course for this intermediate is elimination followed by enolate tautomerization. However, these two steps can be interrupted by various nucleophiles and electrophiles, respectively. Oxyallyl cation trapping {{has been developed}} extensively by Fredrick G. West of the University of Alberta and his review covers the field. The oxyallyl cation can be trapped with heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles and can also undergo cationic cycloadditions with various tethered partners. Shown below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a pentacyclic core in <b>one</b> <b>step</b> with complete diastereoselectivity.|$|E

5|$|Researchers have {{synthesized}} many three-dimensional DNA complexes {{that each}} have the connectivity of a polyhedron, {{such as a}} cube or octahedron, meaning that the DNA duplexes trace the edges of a polyhedron with a DNA junction at each vertex. The earliest demonstrations of DNA polyhedra were very work-intensive, requiring multiple ligations and solid-phase synthesis steps to create catenated polyhedra. Subsequent work yielded polyhedra whose synthesis was much easier. These include a DNA octahedron made from a long single strand designed to fold into the correct conformation, and a tetrahedron that can be produced from four DNA strands in <b>one</b> <b>step,</b> pictured {{at the top of}} this article.|$|E

5|$|The {{generation}} of new genes can also involve small parts of several genes being duplicated, with these fragments then recombining to form new combinations with new functions. When new genes are assembled from shuffling pre-existing parts, domains act as modules with simple independent functions, {{which can be}} mixed together to produce new combinations with new and complex functions. For example, polyketide synthases are large enzymes that make antibiotics; they contain up to one hundred independent domains that each catalyse <b>one</b> <b>step</b> in the overall process, like a step in an assembly line.|$|E
5|$|The goal of elucidating {{pathophysiology}} {{has also}} led to increased interest in the association between risk-SNPs and the gene expression of nearby genes, the so-called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies. The reason is that GWAS studies identify risk-SNPs, but not risk-genes, and specification of genes is <b>one</b> <b>step</b> closer towards actionable drug targets. As a result, major GWA studies by 2011 typically included extensive eQTL analysis. One of the strongest eQTL effects observed for a GWA-identified risk SNP is the SORT1 locus. Functional follow up studies of this locus using small interfering RNA and gene knock-out mice have {{shed light on the}} metabolism of low-density lipoproteins, which have important clinical implications for cardiovascular disease.|$|E

5|$|A {{scoring system}} to {{evaluate}} material {{is to add}} up the piece values of the material on the board. In chess, when a pawn equals one unit, a bishop or knight is worth three, a rook five and a queen nine. These values are {{a consequence of the}} difference in mobility of the pieces. In bughouse, piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have the same mobility as they can be dropped on any vacant square. The pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess, as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns. They can for instance be dropped to block non-contact checks. Pawns can be dropped onto the seventh rank, <b>one</b> <b>step</b> away from promotion, which again adds to their importance. Long-range pieces like the queen or the rook lose relative value, due to the constantly changing pawn structure. They {{are also more likely to}} be hemmed in. A valuation system, first suggested by FICS-player Gnejs, often applied to bughouse is pawn=1, bishop=knight=rook=2 and queen=4.|$|E
5|$|Although {{designed}} {{by one of}} Square's development teams in Japan, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was specifically geared for the U.S. market. At the time, console role-playing games were not a major genre in North America; Square thus attempted to broaden the genre's appeal through Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Square had already released several Final Fantasy spinoffs in North America, including the first three titles in the SaGa series as Final Fantasy Legend, and the first Mana series game as Final Fantasy Adventure, and wished to further break into the popular American consciousness. Square's executives cited the alleged difficulty of RPGs as the reason Americans shied away from them, and eased the difficulty level by tweaking {{various aspects of the}} main series' gameplay. The American release of Final Fantasy IV was altered to make the game simpler, for example. Mystic Quest was to take this <b>one</b> <b>step</b> further, and the Japanese developers worked with the American offices to make sure the game was accessible to children.|$|E
