2500|$|The Romans tended towards syncretism, {{seeing the}} same gods under {{different}} names in different places of the Empire, accommodating other Europeans such as the Hellenes, Germans, and Celts, and Semitic and other groups in the Middle East. Under Roman authority, the various national myths most similar to Rome were adopted by analogue into the overall Roman mythos, further cementing Imperial control.

In the first poll he placed second, behind Sena, but in another two he ranked first. He was also chosen by the readers as the character who would win an [...] "Evil Showdown" [...] against Agon Kongo, as well as the best quarterback in the series. In an interview, Atsushi Tamura said about Hiruma: [...] "I look just like this guy"; and stated that he [...] "think there is a lot <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> want to do the Hiruma's role".

2500|$|In 1973, {{the story}} [...] "Flash Crowd" [...] by Larry Niven {{described}} a concept similar to flash mobs.

In the story, broadcast coverage attracts the attention <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> use the widely available technology of the teleportation booth to swarm first that event—thus intensifying the riot—and then other events as they happen. Commenting on the social impact of such mobs, one character (articulating the police view) says, [...] "We call them flash crowds, and we watch for them." [...] In related short stories, they are named as a prime location for illegal activities (such as pickpocketing and looting) to take place.|$|E

There are many examples of what we did to be found in the Bible – Gideon and Samson, for instance. This had an influence on our thinking.
