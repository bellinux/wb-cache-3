40|$|Millimetre {{observations}} of pre-main sequence stars probe the cold {{dust in the}} outer regions of the forming star system. It is in these outer regions that planets are thought to form out of the gas and dust within the circumstellar disk. Therefore, by observing young stellar objects at millimetre wavelengths we can determine the characteristics of circumstellar material, and hence, we can infer {{the possibility of a}} system forming planets. In order to characterise the circumstellar environment of pre-main sequence stars, a 3. 3 mm survey of continuum dust emission was performed using the OVRO interferometer array. A sample of targets in the nearby star forming region rho Ophiuchus were selected to encompass the entire range of pre-main sequence evolution, from starless clumps to Class III T Tauri stars. These data were then used to constrain properties of the circumstellar material in these young systems, in particular the dust <b>opacity</b> <b>index,</b> beta, and the mass of the material. The value of beta is used to study whether grain growth of the dust is occurring in these systems, which is a key stage in some planet formation models. Calculating the mass of the system can indicate whether enough circumstellar material is present to form planets. We also combine these new millimeter observations with literature data to create spectral energy distributions (SEDs), which are then fit in order to determine a best-fit model of the system using the models of Robitaille et al. (2007). We find that the dust <b>opacity</b> <b>index</b> evolves from a value {{similar to that of the}} ISM for the starless clumps beta ~ 2. 3, to one closer to beta ~ 0. 2 for the Class II objects. This low beta could be accounted for by the inclusion of larger grains within the disk, indicating the possibility of grain growth through the evolutionary stages of a young system. For the Class I and Class II sources we find similar trends in beta to those found in Andrews & Williams (2007 a). An estimate of circumstellar mass assuming a constant dust <b>opacity</b> <b>index</b> was made using the flux of each source. Carrying out this calculation yielded a mean mass of 0. 033 Msun, with almost 50 % of the sources having a mass > 0. 01 Msun. A more in depth estimate of mass was also performed using the value newly calculated value of the dust <b>opacity</b> <b>index.</b> The mass estimates indicated many of the sources observed by this survey have the mass of dust available in the system to form planets...|$|E

Using sub arc-second interferometric observations obtained with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) at the 1. 3 and 2. 7 mm wavelengths, I have {{for the first time}} resolved their disks. I deduce that the 5 Myr old V 892 Tau has a low dust <b>opacity</b> <b>index</b> β= 1. 1 and a disk mass of 0. 03. These values correspond to the growth of its dust into large up to centimeters size structures. In contrast, the very young (a few 10 ^ 5 yrs) PV Cep has a quite high <b>opacity</b> <b>index</b> β = 1. 75 and a more massive disk 0. 8. PV Cep has the youngest resolved disk around any Herbig Ae star.

This suggests that PV Cep's dust evolution is slower than T Tauri stars'. I also present high spatial resolution interferometric observations of the PV Cep outflow.

40|$|Abstract. Polarization at 800 and 1100 µm {{has been}} {{observed}} in the star-forming regions Mon R 2, DR 21 and W 3 -IRS 4. These data {{have been used to}} test proposed mechanisms for producing polarized dust emission in the submillimetre. It was found that illumination effects are not sufficient to explain the observed polarization, and that some degree of grain alignment is required. In general, mechanical alignment (via collisions with molecules) and radiative alignment of asymmetrical grains are the most probable mechanisms. The degrees and directions of polarization observed in DR 21 are found to be wavelength dependent at 800 to 1100 µm. A search of previous JCMT polarimetry results shows that for about half the sources observed, p(1100) is greater than p(800), while in most of the other sources the two values of p are in agreement. A possible explanation for this result is that there are two (or more) non-cospatial grain populations along the line of sight, with different degrees of polarizability and different <b>opacity</b> <b>indices.</b> This can produce bias effects in the polarization percentage and position angle. Thus the choice of wavelength is not immaterial in dust emission polarimetry, as is commonly believed. Key words: ISM: magnetic fields – polarization 1...|$|R

Also, we showed that the “binary system” can be bound gravitationally and we estimated the specific angular momentum, which is between those of binary stars and molecular cloud cores. In addition, we marginally detected linear polarizations at the center of IRS 3 B (implying a toroidal magnetic field) in continuum and at the bipolar outflow region in CO. (3) Circumstellar disks: We present the results of 6 objects (CI Tau, DL Tau, DO Tau, FT Tau, Haro 6 - 13, and HL Tau) in our T Tauri disk survey using CARMA. The data consist of 1. 3 mm and 2. 7 mm continuum with an angular resolution up to 0. 13 ′′. Through visibility modeling of two disk models (power-law disk with a Gaussian edge and viscous accretion disk) to fit the two wavelength data simultaneously in Bayesian inference, we constrained disk properties. In addition, we detected a dust lane at 100 AU radius of HL Tau, which is gravitationally unstable and can be fragmented. Besides, CI Tau and DL Tau appear to have a spiral pattern. Moreover, we found that more evolved disks have a shallower density gradient and that disks with a smaller dust <b>opacity</b> spectral <b>index</b> are less massive, which implies “hidden” masses in the cold midplane and/or in large grains. Finally, we found that the accretion disk model is preferred by HL Tau, which has a strong bipolar outflow and accretion, while the power-law disk model is preferred by DL Tau, which has experienced dust settlement and has weak accretion. This implies that the accretion disk model could be applied to disks only in a limited age range...|$|R
40|$|Context. To {{characterize}} {{the mechanisms of}} planet formation {{it is crucial to}} investigate the properties and evolution of protoplanetary disks around young stars, where the initial conditions for the growth of planets are set. The high spatial resolution of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations now allows the study of radial variations of dust properties in nearby resolved disks and the investigation of the early stages of grain growth in disk midplanes. Aims. Our goal is to study grain growth in the well-studied disk of the young, intermediate-mass star HD 163296 where dust processing has already been observed and to look for evidence of growth by ice condensation across the CO snowline, which has already been identified in this disk with ALMA. Methods. Under the hypothesis of optically thin emission, we compare images at different wavelengths from ALMA and VLA to measure the <b>opacity</b> spectral <b>index</b> across the disk and thus the maximum grain size. We also use a Bayesian tool based on a two-layer disk model to fit the observations and constrain the dust surface density. Results. The measurements of the <b>opacity</b> spectral <b>index</b> indicate the presence of large grains and pebbles (≥ 1 cm) in the inner regions of the disk (inside 50 AU) and smaller grains, consistent with ISM sizes, in the outer disk (beyond 150 AU). Re-analyzing ALMA Band 7 science verification data, we find (radially) unresolved excess continuum emission centered near the location of the CO snowline at 90 AU. Conclusions. Our analysis suggests a grain size distribution consistent with an enhanced production of large grains at the CO snowline and consequent transport to the inner regions. Our results combined with the excess in infrared scattered light suggests there is a structure at 90 AU involving the whole vertical extent of the disk. This could be evidence of small scale processing of dust at the CO snowline...|$|R
40|$|We present {{continuum}} observations at 1. 3 and 2. 7 mm {{using the}} Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) toward six protoplanetary disks in the Taurus molecular cloud: CI Tau, DL Tau, DO Tau, FT Tau, Haro 6 - 13, and HL Tau. We constrain physical {{properties of the}} disks with Bayesian inference using two disk models; flared power-law disk model and flared accretion disk model. Comparing the physical properties, {{we find that the}} more extended disks are less flared and that the dust <b>opacity</b> spectral <b>index</b> (beta) is smaller in the less massive disks. In addition, disks with a steeper mid-plane density gradient have a smaller beta, which suggests that grains grow and radially move. Furthermore, we compare the two disk models quantitatively and find that the accretion disk model provides a better fit overall. We also discuss the possibilities of substructures on three extended protoplanetary disks. Comment: 45 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables, to be published in Ap...|$|R
40|$|Received sooner; {{accepted}} later Abstract. We present three 14400 square degree relative extinction {{maps of the}} Galactic Plane (|b | < 20 ◦) {{obtained from}} 2 MASS using accumulative star counts (Wolf diagrams). This method is independent of the colour of {{the stars and the}} variation of extinction with wavelength. Stars were counted in 3 ′. 5 × 3 ′. 5 boxes, every 20 ′ ′. 1 ◦ × 1 ◦ surrounding fields were chosen for reference, hence the maps represent local extinction enhancements and ignore any contribution from the ISM or very large clouds. Data reduction was performed on a Beowulf-type cluster (in approximately 120 hours). Such a cluster is ideal for this type of work as areas of the sky can be independently processed in parallel. We studied how extinction depends on wavelength in all of the high extinction regions detected and within selected dark clouds. On average a power law <b>opacity</b> <b>index</b> (β) of 1. 0 to 1. 8 in the NIR was deduced. The index however differed significantly from region to region and even within individual dark clouds. That said, generally it was found to be constant, or to increase, with wavelength within a particular region...|$|E
40|$|SMA {{observations}} of the massive star-forming region IRAS 18089 - 1732 in the 1 mm and 850 mu band reveal outflow and disk signatures in different molecular lines. The SiO(5 [...] 4) data show a collimated outflow in the northern direction. In contrast, the HCOOCH 3 (20 [...] 19) line, which traces high-density gas, is confined to {{the very center of}} the region and shows a velocity gradient across the core. The HCOOCH 3 velocity gradient is not exactly perpendicular to the outflow axis but between an assumed disk plane and the outflow axis. We interpret these HCOOCH 3 features as originating from a rotating disk that is influenced by the outflow and infall. Based on the (sub-) mm continuum emission, the mass of the central core is estimated to be around 38 M_sun. The dynamical mass derived from the HCOOCH 3 data is 22 Msun, of about the same order as the core mass. Thus, the mass of the protostar/disk/envelope system is dominated by its disk and envelope. The two frequency continuum data of the core indicate a low dust <b>opacity</b> <b>index</b> beta ~ 1. 2 in the outer part, decreasing to beta ~ 0. 5 on shorter spatial scales.

40|$|We present {{observations}} of NGC 1333 from SCUBA- 2 on JCMT, observed as a JCMT Gould Belt Survey pilot project during the shared risk campaign {{when the first}} of four arrays was installed at each of 450 and 850 microns. Temperature maps are derived from 450 micron and 850 micron ratios under the assumption of constant dust <b>opacity</b> spectral <b>index</b> beta= 1. 8. Temperatures indicate that the dust in the northern (IRAS 6 / 8) region of NGC 1333 is hot, 20 - 40 K, due to heating by the B star SVS 3, other young stars in the IR/optically visible cluster, and embedded protostars. Other luminous protostars are also identified by temperature rises at the 17 " resolution of the ratio maps (0. 02 pc assuming a distance of 250 pc for Perseus). The extensive heating raises the possibility that the radiative feedback may lead to increased masses {{for the next generation of}} stars. Comment: accepted by MNRA...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} study of the density {{structure}} of the protostellar collapse candidate B 335 using continuum observations from the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer made at wavelengths of 1. 2 mm and 3. 0 mm. We analyze these data, which probe spatial scales from 5000 AU to 500 AU, directly in the visibility domain by comparison to synthetic observations constructed from models that assume different physical conditions. This approach allows for much more stringent constraints to be derived from the data than from analysis of images. A single radial power law in density provides a good description of the data, with best fit power law density index p = 1. 65 ± 0. 05. Through simulations, we quantify the sensitivity of this result to various model uncertainties, including assumptions of temperature distribution, outer boundary, dust <b>opacity</b> spectral <b>index,</b> and an unresolved central component. The largest uncertainty comes from the unknown presence of a centralized point source. The maximal point source – 2 – with 1. 2 mm flux of F = 12 ± 7 mJy reduces the power law density index t...|$|R
40|$|We present dust <b>opacity</b> {{spectral}} <b>indexes</b> (beta) of {{the youngest}} protostellar systems (so-called Class 0 sources), L 1448 IRS 2, L 1448 IRS 3, and L 1157, obtained between 1. 3 mm and 2. 7 mm continua, using the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). The unprecedented compact configuration and image fidelity of CARMA allow a better detection of the dust continuum emission from Class 0 sources, with a less serious missing flux problem normally associated with interferometry. Through visibility-modeling at both 1. 3 mm and 2. 7 mm simultaneously, as well as image- and visibility-comparison, we show that beta of the three Class 0 sources are around or smaller than 1, indicating that dust grains have already significantly grown at the Class 0 stage. In addition, we find a radial dependence of beta, which implies faster grain growth in the denser central regions and/or dust segregation. Density distributions of the Class 0 sources are also addressed by visibility-modeling. Comment: 16 pages; {{to be published in}} Ap...|$|R
