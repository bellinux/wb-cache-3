50|$|There is no {{evidence}} that the locomotive was actually built but the design includes the essential features of <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotives</b> built in the 20th century, including compressor, combustion chamber, turbine and air pre-heater.|$|R
50|$|The British Rail GT3 was a {{much simpler}} machine {{consisting}} essentially of a standard <b>oil-fired</b> <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> mounted on a standard steam locomotive chassis, built as a demonstrator by English Electric in 1961. Its almost crude simplicity enabled it to avoid much of the unreliability which had plagued the complex experimental GTELs 18000 and 18100 in earlier years, but it nevertheless failed to be competitive against conventional traction and was scrapped.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{is a list of}} speed records for rail vehicles with on-board fuel to mechanical energy to drive vehicle's wheels such as diesel-hydraulic trains and <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotive</b> trains that use mechanical transmission to power the drive wheels.|$|R
50|$|A Gas <b>turbine</b> <b>{{locomotive}}</b> is {{a locomotive}} {{powered by a}} <b>gas</b> <b>turbine.</b> The majority of <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotives</b> have had electric transmission but mechanical transmission has also been used, particularly in the early days. The advantage of using <b>gas</b> <b>turbines</b> {{is that they have}} very high power-to-bulk and power-to-weight ratios. The disadvantage is that <b>gas</b> <b>turbines</b> generally have lower thermal efficiency than diesel engines, especially when running at less than full load.|$|R
50|$|The works has {{produced}} many locomotives for {{both domestic and}} foreign railways. It was a major supplier of diesel-electrics to British Railways notably the Class 55 Deltic. The works also developed a prototype <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotive,</b> the British Rail GT3.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} free-piston gas {{generators}} were developed, and such units were in widespread use in large-scale {{applications such as}} stationary and marine powerplants. [...] Attempts were made to use free-piston gas generators for vehicle propulsion (e.g. in <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotives)</b> but without success.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the coal power station, Liddell runs two 25 MW <b>oil-fired</b> <b>gas</b> <b>turbines</b> and an 0.85 MW mini-hydroelectric generator. It is also [...] "licensed to co-fire plant biomass and coal to produce electricity", which essentially means it can use sawdust and wood shavings from the nearby timber industry as a portion of its fuel, replacing up to 5% of its coal requirements. In practice, however, biomass accounts for only about 0.5% of Liddell's output.|$|R
50|$|A {{turbojet}} {{train is}} a train powered by turbojet engines. Like a jet aircraft, but unlike a <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotive,</b> {{the train is}} propelled by the jet thrust of the engines, rather than by its wheels. Only a handful of jet-powered trains have been built, for experimental research in high-speed rail.|$|R
50|$|On 23 December 1952 the UK Ministry of Fuel and Power {{placed an}} order for a {{coal-fired}} <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotive</b> to be used on British Railways. The locomotive was to be built by the North British Locomotive Company and the turbine would be supplied by C. A. Parsons and Company.|$|R
5000|$|Sawyer {{worked as}} a {{technical}} advisor to the U.S. Army during the 1950s where he helped develop application of <b>gas</b> <b>turbines</b> through mechanical drive to a locomotive {{which was the first}} step in applying nuclear power to military transportation. [...] He was the chief engineer on the project that created the first <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotive</b> with mechanical drive that was completed for the Army in 1952.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s the Swiss Federal <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotive,</b> the Am 4/6 1101 {{was tested}} by the German railways: Its higher fuel {{consumption}} compared to the DB Class V 200.0 made it uneconomical for the Deutsche Bundesbahn to consider introducing similar locomotives and afterwards reciprocating diesel engines were {{the primary source of}} non-electric traction on German raillines.|$|R
50|$|GT3, meaning Gas Turbine number 3 (following 18000 and 18100 as <b>gas</b> <b>turbines</b> 1 and 2), was a {{prototype}} mainline <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotive</b> built in 1961 by English Electric at their Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows {{to demonstrate its}} wares to British Railways. It was designed by Vulcan engineer J. O. P. Hughes in a project that started in the early 1950s. Externally it resembled a steam tender locomotive, although, {{in the case of}} GT3, the tender carried kerosene fuel.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1940s and 1950s {{research}} was done, {{in both the}} USA and UK, aimed at building <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotives</b> which could run on pulverized coal. The main problem was to avoid erosion of the turbine blades by particles of ash. Some bench testing was done but the projects were abandoned before any complete locomotives were built. The sources for the following information are Robertson [...] and Sampson.|$|R
50|$|A gas turbine-electric {{locomotive}}, or GTEL, is {{a locomotive}} {{that uses a}} <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> to drive an electrical generator or alternator. The turbine (similar to a turboshaft engine) drives an output shaft, which drives the alternator via a system of gears. The produced electric current powers the traction motors. This type of locomotive was first experimented with in 1920, reaching its peak in the 1950s to 1960s. A related development is the <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotive</b> in which the turbine drives the wheels without an intermediate electrical device, {{at the cost of}} mechanical complexity.|$|R
40|$|Increases in {{the price}} of such {{conventional}} fuels as Diesel No. 2, as well as advancements in turbine technology, have prompted the present economic assessment of coal-fired <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotive</b> engines. A regenerative open cycle internal combustion <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> engine may be used, given the development of ceramic hot section components. Otherwise, an external combustion <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> engine appears attractive, since although its thermal efficiency is lower than that of a Diesel engine, its fuel is far less expensive. Attention is given to such a powerplant which will use a fluidized bed coal combustor. A life cycle cost analysis yields figures that are approximately half those typical of present locomotive engines...|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 1948 all {{existing}} GWR locomotives {{became the}} property of the new British Railways (BR); unlike other companies stock, all the steam locomotives continued to carry their GWR numbers. BR continued to build GWR designs (the 1000, 1500, 1600, 4073 and 6959 classes in particular) for a while. When the first BR Standard steam locomotives started to arrive, they were often compared unfavourably to ex-GWR locos, and the Western Region decided to take forward experiments with diesel-hydraulic and <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
50|$|The only {{locomotives}} {{built for}} British Railways at the works, were the twenty BR Class 28 diesel electrics during 1958-59, and the experimental 25kV AC locomotive E1000 {{which was built}} by converting the <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotive</b> E18100. Work commenced in January 1958 when E18100 was brought to Bowesfield Works from storage at Dukinfield Works. The conversion of E18100 involved {{the removal of the}} <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> unit, generator and the middle traction motor from each bogie, which changed the locomotive from a Co-Co to an A1A-A1A wheel arrangement. The necessary electrical equipment such as the transformer, mercury arc rectifiers and pantograph etc. was installed, with the work completed by October 1958.|$|R
40|$|Selective {{catalytic}} reduction (SCR) {{is a process}} for the post-combustion removal of NO{sub x} from the flue gas of fossil-fuel-fired power plants. SCR is capable of NO{sub x} reduction efficiencies of up to 80 or 90 percent. SCR technology has been applied for treatment of flue gases {{from a variety of}} emission sources, including natural gas- and <b>oil-fired</b> <b>gas</b> <b>turbines,</b> process steam boilers in refineries, and coal-fired power plants. SCR applications to coal-fired power plants have occurred in Japan and Germany. Full-scale SCR systems have not been applied to coal-fired power plants in the U. S., although there have been small-scale demonstration projects. SCR has become increasingly widely applied in the U. S. to natural-gas fired <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> combined cycle systems. In the remainder of this section, we review the applicability of SCR, as well as the need for post-combustion NO{sub x} control, for several power generation systems...|$|R
50|$|Work {{leading to}} the {{emergence}} of the <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotive</b> began in France and Sweden in the 1920s but the first locomotive did not appear until 1933. These early experiments used piston engines as gas generators. This idea has not been widely adopted, but it might be worth re-visiting. High fuel consumption was {{a major factor in the}} decline of conventional gas-turbine locomotives and the use of a piston engine as a gas generator would probably give better fuel economy than a turbine-type compressor, especially when running at less than full load.|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{turbomachine}} {{technology and}} novel methods of coal combustion {{may have made}} possible {{the development of a}} competitive coal fired <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotive</b> engine. Of the combustor, thermodynamic cycle, and turbine combinations presently assessed, an external combustion closed cycle regenerative <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> with a fluidized bed coal combustor is judged to be the best suited for locomotive requirements. Some merit is also discerned in external combustion open cycle regenerative systems and internal combustion open cycle regenerative <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> systems employing a coal gasifier. The choice of an open or closed cycle depends on the selection of a working fluid and the relative advantages of loop pressurization, with air being the most attractive closed cycle working fluid on the basis of cost...|$|R
25|$|Union Pacific {{operated}} the largest fleet of such locomotives of any railroad in the world, {{and was the}} only railroad to use them for hauling freight. Most other GTELs have been built for small passenger trains, {{and only a few}} have seen any real success in that role. With a rise in fuel costs (eventually leading to the 1973 oil crisis), <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotives</b> became uneconomical to operate, and many were taken out of service. Additionally, Union Pacific's locomotives required more maintenance than originally anticipated, due to fouling of the turbine blades by the Bunker C oil used as fuel.|$|R
25|$|For AC locomotives, {{the first}} number {{was to be}} an {{indication}} of power. For example, if the power was in the range 2000 to 2999hp, it would be numbered between E2000-E2999, and so on. In fact, apart from E2001 (the prototype AC locomotive, converted from a <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotive,</b> later Class 80), all AC locomotives were numbered from E3001 upwards. When new 5000hp locomotives were under construction (later Class 87), these were allocated numbers from E3201 upwards, though they never carried these numbers as the 1973 arrangements were already {{in place by the}} time the first one was built.|$|R
50|$|The last run of a <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{took place}} on December 26, 1969. Their running gear was {{recycled}} into the GE U50 series of locomotives. Trucks, traction motors and span bolsters from locomotives 51 to 75 {{were used in the}} construction of the U50, and trucks and traction motors from locomotives in the 1 to 30 series were used {{in the construction of the}} U50C. Several of the tenders were retained and converted to hold water for maintenance of way purposes and later to be used for Union Pacific's operating steam locomotives, UP 844, UP 3985 and UP 4014.|$|R

50|$|It {{was also}} heavier than {{expected}} in fuel costs. The efficiency of a <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> reduces dramatically at low power outputs so to achieve respectable fuel economy a <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{needs to be}} operated {{as much as possible}} at full power, with periods of part-load running reduced to a minimum. However, it turned out that even on demanding express passenger schedules {{it was not possible to}} operate the locomotive on full power for very much of the run and extended periods of part-load operation were inevitable, which resulted in heavy fuel consumption. It was also sometimes fuelled on the much more expensive and scarce light oil normally used only for starting, due to the level of wear caused by the ash from heavy fuel oil.|$|R
25|$|At the {{formation}} of British Railways on 1 January 1948, early diesel and electric locos and the <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotives</b> 18000 and 18100 were already painted black with aluminium trim, but by the late 1950s this had been superseded by the same shade of green that was used on express passenger steam locomotives, although some locomotives were painted in a two-tone Brunswick and Sherwood green livery, and Southern Region electric locomotives were painted a light shade of malachite green. Multiple units were also generally green, although this tended to be a lighter and bluer shade compared to the colour used on steam and diesel locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|Sawyer {{then joined}} the American Locomotive Company {{where he served}} as head of {{research}} working on both diesel and <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> projects from 1930 to 1956. While working for General Electric in 1925, Sawyer helped assemble and delivered the very first diesel locomotive sold in the United States. [...] In 1944 Sawyer applied {{for one of the}} first <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> powered <b>locomotive</b> patents. The patent was granted in 1948.|$|R
5000|$|Metropolitan-Vickers and Beyer, Peacock & Co. {{formed a}} joint venture company in November 1949 to design and {{manufacture}} diesel, electric and <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>locomotives.</b> Because Beyer, Peacock’s [...] Gorton works was still busy producing steam locomotives, an alternative site for the new locomotives to be built had to be found. A factory at Yarm Road, Stockton-on-Tees, on which Metrovicks had acquired a lease in 1947, {{was chosen as the}} location. The factory which had been built in 1946 for the American construction machinery company LeTourneau, was almost brand new, and covered an area of around 95000 sq ft, later extended to over 125000 sq ft by Metrovicks. The works had its own railway siding running from Bowesfield Junction to the north east of the works. Initially the factory was used by Metrovicks for steel fabrication work before locomotive manufacture began in 1949.|$|R
