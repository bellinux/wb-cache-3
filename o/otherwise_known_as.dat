5|$|The nuclear envelope, <b>otherwise</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> nuclear membrane, {{consists}} of two cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged {{parallel to one another}} and separated by 10 to 50 nanometres (nm). The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and is similarly studded with ribosomes. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen.|$|E

Quême concluded that the duo were always sincere and although their first single was released 20 years ago, it still felt modern.|$|E
5|$|Eight days later, the {{division}} returned {{in preparation for}} assaulting the Hindenburg Line. The division advanced, along with the Fourth Army, pressing the retreating Germans before halting at the Hindenburg support line, {{also known as the}} Le Catelet-Nauroy Line, due to determined German resistance. On 5 October, the line was breached by {{the division}} after the Germans evacuated it for their main position (Siegfried II Stellung, <b>otherwise</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Masnières-Beaurevoir line) near Villers-Outréaux. The German positions lay behind dense lines of barbed wire, supported by concrete pillboxes and machine gun positions hidden in small woods providing excellent fields of fire over otherwise open countryside. Faced with this level of defence, the division was halted and spent the following days reconnoitring the German positions preparing for an assault.|$|E
5|$|Euler proved Newton's identities, Fermat's little theorem, Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, {{and he made}} {{distinct}} {{contributions to}} Lagrange's four-square theorem. He also invented the totient function φ(n), the number of positive integers {{less than or equal}} to the integer n that are coprime to n. Using properties of this function, he generalized Fermat's little theorem to what is now known as Euler's theorem. He contributed significantly to the theory of perfect numbers, which had fascinated mathematicians since Euclid. He proved that the relationship shown between perfect numbers and Mersenne primes earlier proved by Euclid was one-to-one, a result <b>otherwise</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Euclid–Euler theorem. Euler also conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity. The concept is regarded as a fundamental theorem of number theory, and his ideas paved the way for the work of Carl Friedrich Gauss.|$|E
40|$|For {{accurate}} diagnosis, {{detailed information}} about tissue structure and pathology is often needed. A biopsy is a diagnostic test, used to obtain tissue samples for further examination. The tissue undergoes fixation, cutting, dehydratation, paraffin embedding, slicing, rehydratation and staining. Silver {{may be used to}} mark recection borders, when the tissue sample is immersed in a 10 % aquous solution of argent nitrate. After cutting, the silver is developed using a commonn black and white photographic developer. Another option is immersing the tissue sample into an aquous solution of ferric chloride and, after cutting, using an aquous solution of potassium ferrocyanide to produce ferric ferrocyanide, <b>otherwise</b> <b>knows</b> <b>as</b> Prussian blue...|$|R
