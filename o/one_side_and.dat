5|$|Hence, {{weakness}} of shrug on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> head-turning {{on the other}} side may indicate damage to the accessory nerve {{on the side of the}} shrug weakness, or damage along the nerve pathway at the other side of the brain. Causes of damage may include trauma, surgery, tumours, and compression at the jugular foramen. Weakness in both muscles may point to a more general disease process such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome or poliomyelitis.|$|E
5|$|In 1586, {{following}} the death of previous Polish king, Stefan Bathory, the Swedish duke Sigismund III Vasa and Habsburg Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria took part in the election to the joint Polish–Lithuanian throne.

The rivalry between Zamoyski and the Zborowski family dated years past and tensions during the elections ran high.|$|E

5|$|Lea {{took him}} to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> {{informed}} him of the charges, but Corder denied all knowledge of both Maria and the crime. A search of the house uncovered a pair of pistols supposedly bought {{on the day of}} the murder, some letters from a Mr Gardener, which may have contained warnings about the discovery of the crime, and a passport from the French ambassador, evidence which suggested that Corder may have been preparing to flee.|$|E

5|$|The {{boundary}} line was nonetheless still {{fairly easy to}} cross. Local inhabitants were able to maintain fields on the other side, or even to live on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> work on the other. Refugees were able to sneak across or bribe the guards, and the smuggling of goods in both directions was rife. The flow of emigrants remained large despite the increase in East German security measures: 675,000people fled to West Germany between 1949 and 1952.|$|E

One controller was broken open on <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> both were severely corroded and damaged by marine life. Both units were disassembled and the memory units flushed with deionized water. After they were dried and vacuum baked, data from these units was retrieved for forensic examination.|$|E
