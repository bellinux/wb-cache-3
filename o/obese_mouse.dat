40|$|A {{method for}} the {{preparation}} of isolated adipocytes from <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> is described. Similar yields of adipocytes (50 [...] 60 %), as judged by several criteria, are obtained from <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> and lean controls. Few fat-globules and no free nuclei were observed in cell preparations, which are metabolically active, respond to hormonal control and appear to be representative of intact adipose tissue. Noradrenaline-stimulated lipolysis was inhibited by insulin, equally in adipocytes from lean and <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> Inhibition in <b>obese</b> cells required exogenous glucose, and the insulin dose [...] response curve was shifted to the right.

50|$|Later studies {{linked the}} effects of the {{previous}} parabiotic experiments about metabolism to the discovery of leptin. Many hormones and metabolites were proven to not be the satiety factor that caused one rat to starve in the experiments. Leptin seemed like a viable candidate. Starting in 1977, Ruth B.S. Harris, a graduate student under Hervey, repeated previous studies about parabiosis in rats and mice. Due to the discovery of leptin, she analyzed leptin concentrations of the mice in the parabiotic experiments. After injecting leptin into the <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> of each pair, she found that leptin circulated between the conjoined animals, but the circulation of leptin took some time to reach equilibrium. As a result of the injections, almost immediate weight loss resulted in the parabiotic pairs due to increased inhibition. Approximately 50-70% of fat was lost in the pairs. The <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> lost only fat. The lean mouse lost muscle mass and fat. Harris concluded that leptin levels are increased in the obese animal, but other factors could also affect the animals. Also, leptin was determined to decrease fat storage in both the obese and thin animals.|$|E

50|$|In the <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> models, {{inflammation}} and macrophage-specific genes are upregulated in white adipose tissue (WAT). There were also signs of {{dramatic increase in}} circulating insulin level, adipocyte lipolysis and formation of multinucleate giant cells. The fat-derived protein called angiopoietin-like protein 2 (Angptl2) elevates in fat tissues. Higher than normal Angptl2 level in fat tissues develop inflammation as well as insulin and leptin resistance. Stored fat secretes Leptin to signal satiety. Leptin resistance {{plays a role in}} the process where appetite overrules the message of satiety. Angptl2 then starts an inflammatory cascade causing blood vessels to remodel and attract macrophages. Angptl2 is an adipocyte-derived inflammatory mediator linking obesity to systemic insulin resistance. It is possible that, as an inflammatory marker, leptin responds specifically to adipose-derived inflammatory cytokines.|$|E

This study investigated cellular and subcellular level changes in the small intestine of <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> In this study, a mouse model of obesity was established by early postnatal administration of monosodium glutamate. Changes in body weight were monitored, and pathological changes in the small intestine were evaluated using hematoxylin-eosin and Nissl staining and light and electron microscopy.

50|$|Parabiotic {{experiments}} {{have also been}} used to study diabetes. Douglas Coleman did further parabiotic experiments to determine diabetic chromosomal relationships. A major gene that causes obesity in mice was identified on chromosome 6. The obese gene (ob/ob) was determined from one mutant mouse, discovered in 1950. Coleman and researchers further identified a gene on chromosome 4 that led to hyperphagia and obesity in mice. The gene also correlated to the severe onset of diabetes (db/db gene). The experimenters used parabiosis to conjoin a db/db mouse to a normal mouse, and the normal mouse would starve to death after one week. The db/db mouse would still have a high blood sugar and food in its system. The db/db mouse was determined to have a satiety factor so potent that the other mouse would starve to death. A db/db mouse was conjoined with an ob/ob mouse {{and the result was}} the same as the first experiment. The <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> starved in 20-30 days, similar to the thin counterpart in the first experiment. The db/db mutant mouse overproduced a satiety factor but could not respond to it, perhaps due to a defective receptor, whereas the ob/ob mutant recognized and responded to the factor but could not reproduce it. Further studies with db/db mice with lesions in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus suggested that the receptor for the satiety factor was found in these brain receptors.|$|E
40|$|The genetically <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> of the C 57 B 1 / 6 strain {{displays}} hyperinsulinemia that {{is partly}} due to an exaggerated insulin-secretory responsiveness of its pancreatic β-cells. The cause of this exaggerated responsiveness is unknown. A comparative study of the behaviour of islets and cultured β-cells of lean and obese mice was undertaken to investigate the cause of the hyper-responsiveness of the β-cell of the <b>obese</b> <b>mouse.</b> Insulin secretion studies, electrophysiological studies and spectrofluorimetric studies using lean mouse islets and β-cells were conducted to study the regulation and modulation of the ionic events of the normal insulin secretory pathway. Such studies have never been conducted on lean mice of the C 57 B 1 / 6 strain and hence provide a basis for comparison for work with the <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> and for future work on insulin secretion mechanisms in "normal" mouse β-cells. The results obtained in the lean mouse model were consistent with the currently accepted hypotheses for the role of K+ and Ca 2 + channels in the control of insulin secretion. I hypothesized that the hypersecretion in the <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> β-cell was associated with an altered ionic channel. My research centered primarily on the ATP-sensitive K+ channel and on voltage-dependent Ca 2 + influx, which depends on the activity of voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels. Through the use of physiological and pharmacological agents, I found that the defect in the <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> β-cell could not be attributed to an alteration in the fundamental properties of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel or in the regulation of voltage-dependent Ca 2 + influx. However, insulin secretion studies revealed that an apamin- and quinine-sensitive channel produced different secretory responses in lean and <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> islets. This type of inhibitor sensitivity could not be ascribed to any K+ channel presently known to be involved in β-cell electrical activity. When modulatory mechanisms were compared in lean and <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> β-cells in spectrofluorimetric studies of (Ca 2 +i, it was found that there were differences in membrane repolarization involving a K+ channel that also has a novel sensitivity to inhibitors (charybdotoxin, forskolin, TEA and tolbutamide). From the interpretation of the data the model proposed to explain hypersecretion in <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> β-cells is that in these β-cells there is the expression of an apamin-sensitive K+ channel, which is not present in lean mouse β-cells, and {{that as a result of}} its altered structure or regulation, this apamin-sensitive K+ channel is responsible for the altered behaviour of the <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> β-cell...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the role of / 3 -cell cytoskeletal proteins in the mechanism of insulin release from islets of experimental animals, the Aston obese diabetic hyperglycaemic (ob/ob) mouse and their lean littermates and the cultural insulin secreting /?-cell lines, HIT-TT 5 and RINm 5 F. Investigations were carried out into the glucose induced insulin response of the lean and <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> islets and HIT-TI 5 cells and the D-glyceraldehyde response of RINm 5 F cells using a static incubation system. Colchicine was found to inhibit insulin release from both lean and <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> islets more significantly than cultured TTT-TI 5 and RINm 5 F cells. (Colchicine pre-treatment also inhibited the second phase of insulin release from perifused lean mouse islets and HIT-TI 5 cells). Cytocha-lasin B, used to investigate the role of the microfilamentous system in the mechanism of insulin release enhanced insulin release from both lean and <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> islets to a significantly greater degree than that from cultured HIT-TI 5 and RINm 5 F cells. Pre-treatment of isolated lean and <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> islets and cultured /?-cells with a combination of colchicine and cytochalasin B significantly reduced the insulin response of the HIT-TI 5 and RINm 5 F cells compared with the control values suggesting that intact microtubules are more important for the sustained release of insulin than the microfilamentous system. However, the response was not so clearly defined with the lean and <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> islets. Tubulin was separated from the extracts of lean mouse islets and the HIT-TI 5 and RINm 5 F cells and actin was separated from all of the cell types including the <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> islets by SDS- polyacrylamide electrophoresis. A tubulin radioimmunoassay and a colchicine binding assay were developed to measure the tubulin content of lean and <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> islets, and the shift between the proportions of tubulin dimers and polymerized tubulin under stimulatory and non-stimulatory conditions. The assay methods developed were not prone to be accurate, sensitive and precise but gave some indication of the shift from unpolymerised to polymerised tubulin during glucose stimulated insulin release. These studies show that microtubules do play a fundamental role in the mechanism of insulin release from both islets and cultured HIT-TI 5 and RINm 5 F cells...|$|E

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of metformin on the exacerbation of allergic eosinophilic inflammation in <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> Male C 57 BL 6 /J mice were fed for 10 weeks with high-fat diet (HFD) to induce obesity. the cell infiltration and inflammatory markers in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue were evaluated at 48 h after ovalbumin (OVA) challenge. HFD <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> displayed peripheral IR that was fully reversed by metformin (300 mg/kg/day, two weeks). OVA-challenge resulted in higher influx of total cell and eosinophils in lung tissue of <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> compared with lean group. As opposed, the cell number in BAL fluid of <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> was reduced compared with lean group. Metformin significantly reduced the tissue eosinophil infiltration and prevented the reduction of cell counts in BAL fluid. in <b>obese</b> <b>mice,</b> greater levels of eotaxin, TNF-alpha and NOx, together with increased iNOS protein expression were observed, {{all of which were}} normalized by metformin. in addition, metformin nearly abrogated the binding of NF-kappa B subunit p 65 to the iNOS promoter gene in lung tissue of <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> Lower levels of phosphorylated AMPK and its downstream target acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) were found in lung tissue of <b>obese</b> <b>mice,</b> which were restored by metformin. in separate experiments, the selective iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (20 mg/kg, 3 weeks) and the anti-TNF-alpha mAb (2 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the aggravation of eosinophilic inflammation in <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> in conclusion, metformin inhibits the TNF-alpha-induced inflammatory signaling and NF-kappa B-mediated iNOS expression in lung tissue of <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> Metformin may be a good pharmacological strategy to control the asthma exacerbation in obese individuals.

Epinephrine sensitivity in the db/db mice was reduced only with respect to lipolytic activation, but was unaltered with respect to tissue cyclic AMP elevation and glycogen phosphorylase activation.

Glycerol release was also increased in the lean mice by stimulating at voltages exceeding 10 volts. Cyclic AMP levels were unaffected by electrical stimulation. Omission of calcium from the perfusion medium severely blunted lipolytic activation by electrical stimulation, which could be restored by calcium readdition. These results suggest that an impairment in lipolytic activation by epinephrine distal to activation of adenylate cyclase exists in the skeletal muscle of young db/db mice. Despite of this impairment, however, lipolysis in the <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> muscle was more sensitive to activation by electrical stimulation through a mechanism unrelated to changes in cyclic AMP, but is dependent on extracellular calcium. © 1983.

30|$|N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-driven {{mutagenesis}} led to {{the generation}} of a leptin-mutant mouse strain displaying a coexistence of high serum leptin levels and a phenotype {{very similar to that}} of the <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> strains [30]. In this strain, a missense mutation of the leptin protein changing the valine at position 145 to a glutamate (p.V 145 E) was detected, which was caused by a transversion of the thymine at position 12971 of the leptin gene to an adenine (g. 12971 T>A) corresponding to position 434 of the transcript (c. 434 T>A) [30] [Ensembl:ENSMUSG 00000059201, Ensembl:ENSMUST 00000069789].|$|E

Objective. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) has been considered an important regulator of energy metabolism in obesity. However, the mechanism underlying how TUDCA is involved in insulin resistance is not fully understood. We tested the effects of TUDCA on autophagic dysfunction in <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> Material and Methods. 500 mg/kg of TUDCA was injected into <b>obese</b> <b>mice,</b> and metabolic parameters, autophagy markers, and insulin signaling molecular were assessed by Western blotting and real-time PCR. Results. TheTUDCA injections in the <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> resulted in a reduced body weight gain, lower blood glucose, and improved insulin sensitivity compared with <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> that were injected with vehicle. Meanwhile, TUDCA treatment not only reversed autophagic dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress, but also improved the impaired insulin signaling in the liver of <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> Additionally, the same results obtainedwithTUDCAwere evident in obesemice treatedwith the adenoviral Atg 7. Conclusions. We found that TUDCA reversed abnormal autophagy, reduced ER stress, and restored insulin sensitivity in the liver of obese mic...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesSafflower yellow (SY) is {{the main}} {{effective}} ingredient of Carthamus tinctorius L. It {{has been reported that}} SY {{plays an important role in}} anti-inflammation, anti-platelet aggregation and inhibiting thrombus formation. In present study, we try to investigate the effects of SY on body weight, body fat mass, insulin sensitivity in high fat diet (HFD) -induced <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> MethodsHFD-induced <b>obese</b> male ICR <b>mice</b> were intraperitoneally injected with SY (120 mg kg- 1) daily. Eight weeks later, intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (IPITT) and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) were performed, and body weight, body fat mass, serum insulin levels were measured. The expression of glucose and lipid metabolic related genes in white adipose tissue (WAT) were determined by RT-qPCR and western blot technologies. ResultsThe administration <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> with SY significantly reduced the body fat mass of HFD-induced <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> (P< 0. 05). IPITT test showed that the insulin sensitivity of SY treated <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> were evidently improved. The mRNA levels of insulin signaling pathway related genes including insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS 1), PKB protein kinase (AKT), glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK 3 β) and forkhead box protein O 1 (FOXO 1) in mesenteric WAT of SY treated mice were significantly increased to 1. 9, 2. 8, 3. 3 and 5. 9 folds of that in HFD-induced control <b>obese</b> <b>mice,</b> respectively (P< 0. 05). The protein levels of AKT and GSK 3 β were also significantly increased to 3. 0 and 5. 2 folds of that in HFD-induced control <b>obese</b> <b>mice,</b> respectively (P< 0. 05). Meanwhile, both the mRNA and protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorgamma coactivator 1 α (PGC 1 α) in inguinal subcutaneous WAT of SY group were notably increased to 2. 5 and 3. 0 folds of that in HFD-induced control <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> (P< 0. 05). ConclusionsSY significantly reduce the body fat mass, fasting blood glucose and increase insulin sensitivity of HFD-induced <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> The possible mechanism is to promote the browning of subcutaneous WAT and activate the IRS 1 /AKT/GSK 3 β pathway in visceral WAT. Our study provides an important experimental evidence for developing SY as a potential anti-obesity and anti-diabetic drug...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study aims {{at using}} 18 F-FDG microPET {{to monitor the}} brown adipose tissue (BAT) glucose {{metabolism}} in <b>obese</b> and diabetic <b>mouse</b> models under different interventions, and study the therapeutic potential of BAT activation for weight loss and lowering of blood glucose in these models. Methods: <b>Obese</b> <b>mice</b> were established by a high-fat diet for eight weeks, and diabetes mellitus(DM) models were induced with Streptozocin in <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> 18 F-FDG microPET was used to monitor BAT function during obese and DM modeling, and also after BRL 37344 (a b 3 -adrenergic receptor agonist) or levothyroxine treatment. The BAT function was correlated with the body weight and blood glucose levels. Results: Compared with the controls, the <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> and DM mice showed successively lower 18 F-FDG uptake in the interscapular BAT (P 50. 036 and, 0. 001, respectively). After two-week BRL 37344 treatment, the BAT uptake was significantly elevated in both <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> (P 50. 010) and DM mice (P 50. 004), accompanied with significantly decreased blood glucose levels (P 50. 023 an...|$|R
