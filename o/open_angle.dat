5|$|Narrow/closed angle {{glaucoma}} is an {{autosomal dominant}} inheritable trait in the breed. It {{is a leading}} cause of blindness in dogs, and is where there is increased fluid pressure within the eye. If the fluid is not reduced, the pressure causes permanent damage to the retina and optic nerve. Loss of eyesight can happen as quickly as within 24 hours if the pressure if elevated enough, or slowly over time if it is only a mild elevation. The sudden, rapid elevation of pressure is more common with narrow/closed angle glaucoma which is more common to the breed than the slower <b>open</b> <b>angle</b> glaucoma. Symptoms can include redness in the eye, the eye itself looking cloudy, sensitivity to light and the dog may rub at their eye, or even rub it along other objects and carpet as the condition is moderate to extremely painful. Treatment can vary depending on the severity of the condition but if inherited glaucoma appears in one eye then it usually occurs in the other eye eventually.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} measurable biometric parameters like {{anterior chamber}} depth, axial length, lens thickness, relative lens position in normal, angle closure suspects in non cataractous and cataractous eyes. METHODS: A total of 345 eyes involvi ng {{all age groups}} and both sexes with <b>open</b> <b>angles,</b> angle closure suspects with clear and cataractous lens were selected randomly among patients attending OPD {{during the period of}} A ugust 2013 to M ay 2014. RESULTS: Axial length in present study was significantly less in angle closure suspects (22. 41 ± 0. 52) as compared to <b>open</b> <b>angles</b> (23. 23 ± 0. 51) (P< 0. 001). Thickness of lens in angle closure suspects (4. 44 ± 0. 9) was significantly more as compared to open angles(4. 28 ± 0. 28) (P< 0. 001). Anterior chamber depth was significantly low in angle closure suspects (2. 59 ± 0. 9) as compared to <b>open</b> <b>angles</b> (3. 19 ± 0. 9) (P< 0. 001). Lens was detected to be anteriorly placed in angle closure suspects when compared to <b>open</b> <b>angles</b> with clear le ns. There {{were no significant differences in}} parametric measurements between males and females. CONCLUSION: Angle closure suspects in the study is associated with shorter axial length, thicker crystalline lenses, shallow anterior chamber, anteriorly placed lens compared to <b>open</b> <b>angles.</b> Angle closure suspects in this study group seem to be associated with shallower anterior chambers, thicker crystalline lenses, anteriorly placed lens and shorter axial length s more in eyes with cataractous lens when compared to clear lens...|$|R

2500|$|The primary {{division}} in categorizing {{different types of}} glaucoma is open-angle and closed-angle (or angle-closure) glaucoma.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} early postoperative {{changes in}} intraocular pressure (IOP) following phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Methods: This prospective study included 129 eyes with <b>open</b> <b>angles</b> and normal or high IOP undergoing phacoemulsification and IOL implantation for senile cataracts. The patients {{were divided into}} 3 groups (Gs) based on preoperative IOP: ≤ 15 mmHg (G 1, n= 76); from 16 to 20 mmHg (G 2, n= 43) and; from 21 to 30 mmHg (G 3, n= 10). IOP was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry one day before surgery, and 1 and 6 weeks postoperatively. Results: IOP was decreased postoperatively in all study groups 1 and 6 weeks after surgery as follows: 2. 8 ± 1. 5 and 1. 8 ± 1. 7 mmHg respectively in G 1 (P< 0. 001); 4. 2 ± 1. 9 and 4. 3 ± 2. 9 mmHg respectively in G 2 (P< 0. 001), and 8. 3 ± 4. 3 and 9. 3 ± 4. 1 mmHg respectively in G 3 (P< 0. 001).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{changes in}} anterior chamber depth (ACD) and intraocular pressure (IOP) after phacoemulsification in eyes with occludable angles {{and compare the}} results with those in eyes with normal <b>open</b> <b>angles.</b> SETTING: Eye Clinic, Ipoh General Hospital, Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia. METHODS: Patients with nonglaucomatous eyes with <b>open</b> <b>angles</b> or with occludable angles were recruited. Ocular biometric measurements (ACD, axial length [AL], lens thickness and position) and IOP (tonometry) were performed preoperatively and 1 day and 1, 4, 9, and 12 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS: The open-angle group and occludable-angle group each comprised 35 patients. The occludable-angle group had a shallower ACD, shorter AL, thicker and relatively anterior lens position, and higher IOP preoperatively; postoperatively, {{there was a significant}} increase in ACD and a significant reduction in IOP (P<. 01). Anterior chamber deepening was inversely related to preoperative ACD in the occludable-angle group (P<. 01). The mean preoperative IOP was higher in the occludable-angle group (15. 77 mm Hg +/- 2. 20 [SD]) than in the open-angle group (14. 52 +/- 2. 65 mm Hg) (P<. 05). The IOP dropped progressively and significantly over 12 weeks postoperatively; the mean decrease was 2. 31 +/- 0. 99 mm Hg in the occludable-angle group and 0. 77 +/- 1. 17 mm Hg in the open-angle group. The IOP decrease in the occludable-angle group was inversely related to the preoperative IOP (P<. 01). CONCLUSION: Phacoemulsification led to anterior chamber deepening and lower IOP in eyes with occludable angles, which suggests it is an option for preventing acute angle closure attacks in eyes with occludable angles and cataract...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{compare the}} effects of {{physiologic}} versus pharmacologic pupil dilation on anterior chamber angle (ACA) measurements obtained with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Methods. Forty eyes from 20 healthy, phakic individuals with <b>open</b> <b>angles</b> underwent anterior segment OCT imaging under 3 pupillary states: (1) pupil constricted under standard room lighting, (2) physiologic mydriasis in a darkened room, and (3) postpharmacologic mydriasis. Inferior angle Schwalbe’s line-angle opening distance (SL-AOD) and SL-trabecular-iris-space area (SL-TISA) were computed for each eye and pupillary condition by masked, certified Reading Center graders using customized grading software. Results. SL-AOD and SL-TISA under pupillary constriction to room light were 0. 87 ± 0. 31 [*]mm and 0. 33 ± 0. 14 [*]mm 2, respectively; decreased to 0. 75 ± 0. 29 [*]mm P< 0. 01 and 0. 29 ± 0. 13 [*]mm 2 [*][*]P< 0. 01, respectively, under physiologic mydriasis; and increased to 0. 90 ± 0. 38 [*]mm P< 0. 01 and 0. 34 ± 0. 17 [*]mm 2 [*][*]P= 0. 06 under pharmacologic mydriasis compared to baseline.
