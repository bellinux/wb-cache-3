40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the sociological impact of public polices enacted during slavery in the United States. Another goal was to discover whether the negative stereotypes <b>of</b> <b>African-Americans</b> in film are related to the reinforcement of negative perceptions established during slavery. Finally, a review of the disparate outcomes produced by new discriminatory policies within the criminal justice system details the impact of current policies that disproportionately impact African-Americans. This thesis examined qualitative research (books and films) analyzing the impact of policies and stereotypes that engender disparate treatment <b>of</b> <b>African-Americans</b> and perpetuate racism in the United States. Research indicated that media reinforces negative stereotypes <b>of</b> <b>African-Americans</b> engendering false perceptions <b>of</b> <b>African-Americans</b> as deviants and criminals, thus causing disproportionate rates <b>of</b> incarceration among <b>African-Americans.</b> Research also illustrated that policies enacted to "combat" crime have a disparate impact on <b>African-Americans</b> because <b>of</b> the prevalence of harmful media (film) imagery. <italic...|$|R

When the black singer Marian Anderson was denied {{the use of}} Washington's Constitution Hall by the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1939, Eleanor resigned from the group in protest and helped arrange another concert {{on the steps of}} the Lincoln Memorial. Roosevelt later presented Anderson to the King and Queen of the United Kingdom after Anderson performed at a White House dinner. Roosevelt also arranged the appointment <b>of</b> <b>African-American</b> educator Mary McLeod Bethune, with whom she had struck up a friendship, as Director of the Division of Negro Affairs of the National Youth Administration. To avoid problems with the staff when Bethune would visit the White House, Eleanor would meet her at the gate, embrace her, and walk in with her arm-in-arm.|$|E

Cudjoe writes that Angelou is representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people. Her use of devices common in fictional writing, such as dialog, characterization and thematic development, has led some reviewers to categorize her books as autobiographical fiction.|$|E
