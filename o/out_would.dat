5|$|A {{reported}} {{block on}} player transfers into the club, {{set in place}} by the Hull City board on 28 July 2010 until transfers <b>out</b> <b>would</b> substantially reduce the £39million-per-year wage bill, at first cast doubt on the new manager's efforts to build a squad capable of a quick return to the Premier League; nevertheless, Pearson brought several transfers and loan signings into the club in his bid to strengthen the squad for the season's campaign. The team set a new club record on 12 March 2011 with 14 away matches unbeaten, breaking a previous record held for over 50 years. This 17-match streak was finally broken by Bristol City {{on the last day of}} the 2010–11 season, Hull losing the match 3–0.|$|E

Thenceforth, he rejected the entire Kantian program as it related to mathematics and geometry, and rejected his own earliest work on the subject.|$|E
25|$|Figures such as agent Max Clifford {{have advised}} gay players {{to keep their}} {{sexuality}} a secret {{for the sake of}} their careers, saying that to be openly gay would potentially damage their playing prospects. This would also apply abroad, where even if accepted in England a gay player might face a new barrier if he wished to play in a country less accepting of homosexuality. Coming <b>out</b> <b>would</b> undoubtedly bring a gay player abuse from the terraces, and perhaps elsewhere too; this would affect some players more than others.|$|E
25|$|On April 19, a letting for {{the section}} of NY214 was finally held, but no bids were {{received}} on the project, requiring a second set to begin on June 7. However, Governor Harriman noted {{that the cost of}} the project had gone up to $815,000 instead of the original $700,000 estimated in 1952. The bid was won by Rock Construction Company of Sunset Park on June 25 at the cost of $757,886.60, who noted that official construction began on July 16. By August, trees had been removed and the flooded <b>out</b> <b>would</b> be moved away from the creek to avoid future issues. By early September, the company noted that they were about to pour concrete for one of the new bridges and that construction was progressing at a steady rate.|$|E

25|$|The Dowding {{system is}} {{considered}} {{key to the}} success of the RAF against the German air force (Luftwaffe) during the Battle of Britain. The combination of early detection and rapid dissemination of that information acted as a force multiplier, allowing the fighter force to be used at extremely high rates of effectiveness. In the pre-war period, interception rates of 30% to 50% were considered excellent; that meant that over half the sorties sent <b>out</b> <b>would</b> return without having encountered the enemy. During the Battle, average rates were around 90%, and several raids were met with 100% success rates. Lacking their own direction system, Luftwaffe fighters had little information on the location of their RAF counterparts, and often returned to base having never seen them. When they did, the RAF fighters were almost always in an advantageous position.|$|E
25|$|Colin had {{a health}} scare during {{the autumn of}} 1988 {{and for a moment}} it looked like EastEnders might have been about to do an AIDS storyline. The press speculated that Colin was showing early signs of the disease and the {{possibility}} was even briefly indicated to on-screen when Colin himself began to fear that his symptoms were AIDS related. In fact giving Colin AIDS was never the programme's intention — it was felt that the most simplistic and unhelpful message that the programme could give <b>out</b> <b>would</b> be to have its only homosexual character become HIV positive — particularly as it happened at a time when misconceptions and fear about AIDS were rife. Colin was eventually diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, although this fact was kept from him by his doctor {{for the remainder of the}} year and he lived out 1988 with the belief that he was in perfect health.|$|E
25|$|The PLAN's ambitions include {{operating}} {{out to the}} first and second island chains, as far as the South Pacific near Australia, and spanning to the Aleutian islands, and operations extending to the Straits of Malacca near the Indian Ocean. The future PLAN fleet will be composed of a balance of combatant assets aimed at maximising the PLAN's fighting effectiveness. On the high end, there would be modern destroyers equipped with long-range air defense missiles (Type 052B, Type 052C, Type 052D, Type 051C and Type 055); destroyers armed with supersonic anti-ship missiles (Sovremenny class); advanced nuclear-powered attack and ballistic missile submarines (Type 093, Type 095, Type 094, Type 096); advanced conventional attack submarines (Kilo and Yuan classes); aircraft carriers (Type 001A, Type 002 and Type 003) and large amphibious warfare vessels (Type 071 and Type 075) capable of mobilizing troops at long distances. On the medium and low end, there would be more economical multi-role capable frigates and destroyers (Luhu, Jiangwei II and Jiangkai classes); corvettes (Jiangdao class); fast littoral missile attack craft (Houjian, Houxin and Houbei classes); various landing ships and light craft; and conventionally powered coastal patrol submarines (Song class). The obsolete combat ships (based on 1960s designs) will be phased out in the coming decades as more modern designs enter full production. It may take a decade for the bulk of these older ships to be retired. Until then, they will serve principally on the low end, as multi-role patrol/escort platforms. Their use could be further enhanced in the future by being used as fast transports or fire support platforms. This system of phasing <b>out</b> <b>would</b> see a reversal in the decline in quantity of PLAN vessels by 2015, and cuts in inventory {{after the end of the}} Cold War could be made up for by 2020.|$|E

The fear of a possible Soviet intervention, in case of Gomułka's loss, was also repeated by Radio Free Europe, which noted that Gomułka's argument while [...] "cruel", is likely [...] "entirely correct." [...] Gomułka also persuaded the Catholic Church to urge voters to go to the polls and declare a vote of confidence in the government. Supporting him, Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński officially declared his support for the 'no crossing' policy.|$|E

500|$|During the campaign, Leslie's {{opponent}} Republican John Marshall Harlan was blasted as a [...] "political weathercock" [...] {{for having}} changed his stance on many issues. In one joint debate, Leslie quoted an antebellum speech wherein Harlan {{had called the}} Republican platform [...] "revolutionary, and if carried <b>out,</b> <b>would</b> result {{in the destruction of}} our free government." [...] Harlan admitted his inconsistent stands, declaring that he would rather be right than consistent. Meanwhile, Leslie began moving closer to the [...] "New Departure" [...] wing of his party {{during the course of the}} campaign. Ultimately, Leslie's supporters deemed him [...] "sober, conservative, and safe", and this perception enabled him to defeat Harlan by a considerable margin in the first election in which blacks were allowed to vote.|$|E
500|$|In September 2015, Image's {{solicitations}} for upcoming comics {{revealed that}} The Fade <b>Out</b> <b>would</b> end with issue twelve, which {{was released on}} January 6, 2016. Like the first issue, it had twice as many pages as a standard comic book. It sold an estimated 16,500 copies and was the 136th-best selling issue of the month. Brubaker has said that The Fade Out was, at the time, his most complex story and that it ended [...] "exactly the way [...] pictured it in the beginning". The creators had already begun work on their next collaboration, Kill or Be Killed, before the final issue of The Fade Out had been published. The series was collected into three trade paperback volumes during publication and one oversized hardcover in October 2016. The articles and essays found in the single issues {{are not included in}} the collections.|$|E
500|$|Because of the group's defeat, Knowles' father, Mathew, voluntarily {{dedicated}} {{his time}} to manage them. Mathew Knowles decided to cut the original lineup to four, with the removal of Davis and the Taylor sisters and the inclusion of LeToya Luckett in 1993. Aside from spending time at their church in Houston, Girl's Tyme practiced in their backyards and at Headliners Salon, owned by Knowles' mother, Tina. The group would test routines in the salon, when it was on Montrose Boulevard in Houston, and sometimes would collect tips from the customers. Their try <b>out</b> <b>would</b> be critiqued by the people inside. During their school days, Girl's Tyme performed at local gigs. When summer came, Mathew Knowles established a [...] "boot camp" [...] to train them in dance and vocal lessons. After rigorous training, they began performing as opening acts for established R groups of that time such as SWV, Dru Hill and Immature. Tina Knowles designed the group's attire for their performances.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the tree of heaven's various uses, {{it has also been}} a part of Chinese culture for many centuries and has more recently attained a similar status in the west. Within the oldest extant Chinese dictionary, the Erya, written in the 3rd century BC, the tree of heaven is mentioned second among a list of trees. It was mentioned again in a materia medica compiled during the Tang dynasty in 656 AD. Each work favoured a different character, however, and there is still some debate in the Chinese botanical community as to which character should be used. The current name, chouchun (...) , means [...] "stinking spring", and is a relatively new appellation. People living near the lower Yellow River know it by the name chunshu (...) , meaning [...] "spring tree". The name {{stems from the fact that}} A. altissima is one of the last trees to come out of dormancy, and as such its leaves coming <b>out</b> <b>would</b> indicate that winter was truly over.|$|E
500|$|While at Duino, Rilke and Princess Marie {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} collaborating on a translation of Dante Alighieri's La Vita Nuova (1295). After the Princess left to join her husband at their Lautschin estate, Rilke spent {{the next few weeks}} at the castle preparing to focus on work. [...] During these weeks, he was writing Marien-Leben (The Life of Mary). While walking along the cliffs overlooking the Adriatic Sea near the castle, Rilke claimed to hear a voice calling to him speaking the words of the first line, Wer, wenn ich schriee, hörte mich denn aus der Engel Ordnungen? ("Who, if I cried <b>out,</b> <b>would</b> hear me among the hierarchies of angels?") which he quickly wrote in his notebook. [...] Within days, he produced drafts of the first two elegies in the series and drafted passages and fragments that would later be incorporated into later elegies—including the opening passage of the tenth elegy.|$|E
500|$|Pigot {{had also}} {{developed}} {{the practice of}} frequently flogging the last sailor down from working aloft. On 20 September 1797, Pigot ordered the topsails to be reefed after a squall struck the ship. Dissatisfied {{with the speed of}} the operation because [...] "these would be the yard-arm men, the most skilful topmen" [...] he gave the order that the last men off the yard would be flogged. This policy was particularly unreasonable as the men would be spaced along the yard, and the two whose stations were furthest <b>out</b> <b>would</b> always be the last down. Three young sailors, in their haste to get down, fell to their deaths on the deck. One of the sailors hit and injured the master, Mr. Southcott. Pigot ordered their bodies thrown into the sea with the words [...] "throw the [...] overboard"; a particularly offensive insult in the seaman's vocabulary. He then instructed two boatswain's mates to flog the rest of the topmen when they complained. The topmen were also flogged the next morning.|$|E
