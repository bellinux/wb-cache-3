50|$|Boron (B) is the {{chemical}} element with atomic number 5, occurring as 10B and 11B. At standard temperature and pressure, boron is a trivalent metalloid that has several different allotropes. Amorphous boron is a brown powder {{formed as a}} product of many chemical reactions. Crystalline boron is a very hard, black material with a high melting point and exists in many polymorphs: Two rhombohedral forms, α-boron and β-boron containing 12 and 106.7 atoms in the rhombohedral unit cell respectively, and 50-atom tetragonal boron are the most common. Boron has a density of 2.34−3. Boron's most common isotope is 11B at 80.22%, which contains 5 protons and 6 neutrons. The other common isotope is 10 at 19.78%, which contains 5 protons and 5 neutrons. These are the only stable isotopes of boron; however other isotopes have been synthesised. Boron forms covalent bonds with other nonmetals and has oxidation states of 1, 2, 3 and 4.Boron does not occur naturally as a free element, but in compounds such as borates. The most common sources of boron are tourmaline, borax, Na2B4O5(OH)4·8H2O, and kernite, Na2B4O5(OH)4·2H2O. it is difficult to obtain pure boron. It can be made through the magnesium reduction of boron trioxide, B2O3. This oxide is made by melting boric acid, B(OH)3, which in turn is obtained from borax. Small amounts of pure boron can be made by the thermal decomposition of boron bromide, BBr3, in hydrogen gas over hot tantalum wire, which acts as a catalyst. The most commercially important sources of boron are: sodium tetraborate pentahydrate, Na2B4O7 · 5H2O, which is used in large amounts in making insulating fiberglass and sodium perborate bleach; boron carbide, a ceramic material, is used to make armour materials, especially in bulletproof vests for soldiers and police officers; <b>orthoboric</b> <b>acid,</b> H3BO3 or boric acid, used in the production of textile fiberglass and flat panel displays; sodium tetraborate decahydrate, Na2B4O7 · 10H2O or borax, used in the production of adhesives; and the isotope boron-10 is used as a control for nuclear reactors, as a shield for nuclear radiation, and in instruments used for detecting neutrons.|$|E

30|$|Serum was {{collected}} at three predetermined time points. A: 72  h after initiation of flucloxacillin; B: at 48  h after rifampicin treatment onset but 30  minutes before the fifth dose was delivered (rifampicin trough level); C: 1  hour after fifth rifampicin dose (rifampicin peak level). At each time point, serum flucloxacillin (A,B,C) and rifampicin (B,C) concentrations were assessed using high liquid pressure chromatography technique. A specific and automatable assay {{was developed for}} simultaneous flucloxacillin and rifampicin quantification in human plasma. A Prontosil C 18 AQ[*]+[*] 150 [*]×[*] 4.6  mm column was used for chromatographic separation. Voriconazole was used as internal standard (IS). UV detection was set at three wavelengths: 220  nm for flucloxacillin, 340  nm for rifampicin and 260  nm for IS. Retention times were 3.8  min, 6  min. and 7  min. for flucloxacillin, rifampicin and IS respectively. Rifampicin and flucloxacillin were extracted from plasma and mixed with IS solution, an <b>orthoboric</b> <b>acid</b> pH  3.5 -solution and an ascorbic acid solution to prevent rifampicin oxidation. Limits of quantification and detection were 0.25 - 0.1  μg/ml for flucloxacillin, and 0.1 - 0.03  μg/ml for rifampicin, respectively. Data’s validation for accuracy in intra and inter-day precision were good. Coefficient of variation for flucloxacillin was between 3.43 % and 8.58 % and accuracy between 94.2 % and 103.7 %. For rifampicin, the corresponding numbers were between 1.07 % and 7.54 % and between 96.0 % and 106.4 %, respectively.|$|E
40|$|The odorous house ant, Tapinoma sessile (Say), is the {{principal}} ant invading structures in the mid-south region of the United States (Hedges, 1998) and is ranked {{as one of the}} top five pest ants in the United States (Hedges, 2000). The objective of this study was to determine which treatment, perimeter baits, spray, or a combination of bait and spray, would reduce outdoor and indoor odorous house ant (OHA) populations. To evaluate the effects of these applications, out-door OHA populations were monitored twice before treatments were applied and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 17 weeks after treatment. Residents were phoned after each monitoring to deter-mine indoor ant presence. Four homes were used for each treatment except for the triple bait, which had five. The perimeter spray of 0. 06 % fipronil (Termidor SC) was applied at 244 ml/m 2 (6 gallons per 1000 sq. ft) to 1 ft. up and out from the foundation base. Two bait treatments were applied: one consisted of a 1. 3 % borax experimental liquid bait (Whitmire Micro-Gen) and the other was a triple bait of 5 % <b>orthoboric</b> <b>acid</b> (Niban-FG), 1 % hydramethylnon (Maxforce Fine Granule Insect Bait) and 2 % borax (Terro Ant Killer II).

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} the addition of TiO 2 on the properties of magnesium oxide obtained from seawater by substoichiometrical precipitation with 80 % of the stoichiometrically required quantity of dolomite lime as the precipitation agent. Magnesium oxide obtained from seawater by substoichiometrical precipitation contains boron(III) oxide as an impurity. During the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide, the boron present in seawater (in the form of non-dissociated <b>orthoboric</b> <b>acid</b> H 3 BO 3, and partly as borate ion H 2 BO 3 –) adsorbs onto the magnesium hydroxide precipitate, and therefore has to be reduced as much as possible using the appropriate method of rinsing the magnesium hydroxide precipitate. B 2 O 3 is an undesirable admixture in seawater magnesium oxide. Specifically, the properties of special purpose magnesium oxide, i. e. high strength magnesium oxide, are affected significantly by the content of boron in the product. Good quality sintered magnesium oxide contains a very small amount ofB 2 O 3. The impurity should not exceed w(B 2 O 3) = 0. 005 % in refractory magnesium oxide. The combined method of rinsing the magnesium hydroxide precipitate (3 + 2) was used in sample preparation, i. e. rinsing by decanting was done three times with alkalized distilled water of pH = 12. 50 and twice with distilled water of pH = 6. 74. Multiple rinsing on filter paper (five times) was done using the same rinsing agent (fresh distilled water of pH = 6. 74). The MgO (80 % precipitation) samples were then subjected to isothermal and activated sintering without TiO 2 addition, {{as well as with the}} addition of TiO 2, w(TiO 2) = 5 and 8 %, at the temperature of 1700 oC for 1 hour, with the aim of determining the properties of these samples primarily with regard to the B 2 O 3 content in the samples after sintering. The results indicate that the addition of TiO 2 strongly affects the reduction of the B 2 O 3 content during activated sintering of seawater magnesium oxide, and that the samples can be characterized as refractory material with very low B 2 O 3 content. The addition of TiO 2, w(TiO 2) = 5 %, is sufficient to bind the present CaO and thereby lead to greater evaporation of B 2 O 3 in the process of activated sintering of seawater magnesium oxide. The samples thickened significantly during sintering, i. e. all the samples examined had a very smallamount of open pores...|$|E
