5|$|After Hayden's departure, Ponting {{was joined}} by Martyn, who {{completed}} his half-century in 46 balls. Ponting scored at a slower rate, reaching his 50 <b>off</b> 74 balls with one four. After completing his half century, he accelerated; he hit two sixes <b>off</b> Harbhajan and one <b>off</b> Ashish Nehra. The pair added 100 runs <b>off</b> 109 balls for the third wicket. Ponting reached his century quickly—his second fifty came <b>off</b> 29 balls. At {{the end of the}} innings, Australia had scored 359 runs for two wickets; Ponting had scored 140 not out (<b>off</b> 121 balls; four fours and eight sixes) and Martyn hit 88 not out (<b>off</b> 84 balls; seven fours and one six) respectively. As of the 2015 competition, Ponting's innings remains the highest individual score by a captain in a World Cup final, and Australia's total remains the highest by a team in a World Cup final. The 234-run stand between Ponting and Marytn was a record partnership for Australia in ODIs at that point in time. The Indian bowlers conceded 37 extras. Srinath conceded 87 runs without taking a wicket—the most expensive figures in his career—in what was his last international game.|$|E
5|$|An {{experiment}} by the Australian zoologist A.D. Blest {{demonstrated that}} the more an eyespot resembled a real vertebrate eye in both colour and pattern, the more effective it was in scaring <b>off</b> insectivorous birds. In another experiment using peacock butterflies, Blest showed that when the conspicuous eyespots had been rubbed <b>off,</b> insectivorous birds (yellow buntings) were much less effectively frightened <b>off,</b> and therefore both the sudden appearance of colour, and the actual eyespot pattern, contribute {{to the effectiveness of}} the deimatic display.|$|E

5|$|Another unusual feature {{found in}} the abyssal and hadal zones is the cold seep, {{sometimes}} called a cold vent.

The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, at a depth of 3200meters in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the World Ocean, including the Monterey Submarine Canyon just <b>off</b> Monterey Bay, California, the Sea of Japan, <b>off</b> the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, <b>off</b> the Atlantic coast of Africa, <b>off</b> the coast of Alaska, and under an ice shelf in Antarctica.|$|E

5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn <b>off</b> the noise were manipulated by one button turning <b>off</b> the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise <b>off</b> for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn <b>off</b> the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it <b>off</b> for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E

5|$|Five or more subpopulations {{have been}} suggested, {{and several of}} these mainly in the western North Pacific have been {{considered}} either functionally or virtually extinct. Of the populations that once existed <b>off</b> coastal Japan, the last recorded confirmed stranding was in the 1910s. Today, call types suggest only two populations in the North Pacific. Some scientists regard that historical populations <b>off</b> Japan were driven to extinction by whaling activities, mostly from the Kumanonada Sea <b>off</b> Wakayama, in the , and in the Sea of Hyūga. Nowadays, possible vagrants from either eastern or offshore populations are observed on very rare occasions <b>off</b> Kushiro. There were also small, but constant catch records around the Korean Peninsula and in the coastal waters of the Sea of Japan; this species is normally considered not to frequent into marginal seas, such as the Sea of Okhotsk, on usual migrations. Whales were known to migrate further north to eastern Kamchatka, the Gulf of Anadyr, <b>off</b> Abashiri or the southern Sea of Okhotsk, and the Commander Islands. Only three sightings were made between 1994 and 2004 in Russia with one sighted <b>off</b> east coast of the peninsula in 2009, and the last known occurrence in the eastern Sea of Okhotsk was in 1948. In addition, whales have not been confirmed <b>off</b> the Commander Islands for over past 80 years. In 2017, 13 or more whales were observed <b>off</b> Kamchatka and Commander Islands. Historically, wintering grounds existed <b>off</b> the Hawaiian Archipelago, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Bonin Islands and Ryukyu Islands, the Philippines, Taiwan, the Zhoushan Archipelago, and the South China Sea such as in Daya Bay, <b>off</b> the Leizhou Peninsula, and <b>off</b> Hainan Island, and further south to the Paracel Islands. Archaeological records suggest blue whales once migrated into the Sea of Japan, along the Korean Peninsula and northwestern Kyushu, and to the Yellow and Bohai Sea as well. A stranding was recorded in Wanning in 2005. One whale was sighted <b>off</b> Weizhou Island in 2017.For further status in Chinese and Korean waters, see Wildlife of China.|$|E
5|$|For Asian stocks, {{resident}} {{groups may}} {{exist in the}} Yellow Sea and East China Sea, and the Sea of Japan (though these populations are critically endangered and the population <b>off</b> China, Korea, and Japan are either near extinction or in very small numbers). Very small increases in sightings have been confirmed <b>off</b> Shiretoko Peninsula, Abashiri, and Kushiro in Hokkaido, Tsushima, Sado Island, <b>off</b> Maiduru in the Sea of Japan since in late 2000s as whales in Sea of Okhotsk might have started recolonizing into former habitats (for coastal Sakhalin, as well). Whales possibly used to migrated into Seto Inland Sea.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the banded houndshark is {{commonly}} displayed in public aquariums in China and Japan, and has reproduced in captivity. Individuals have survived in captivity for over five years. This species is often caught incidentally <b>off</b> Japan in gillnets and set nets; {{the meat is}} sometimes sold, but {{is considered to be}} of poorer quality than that of other houndsharks in the region. It is caught in lesser numbers <b>off</b> Taiwan, and is probably also fished <b>off</b> Korea and northern China. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the banded houndshark under Least Concern, as it remains abundant throughout its range. <b>Off</b> Japan, it can be found in rocky areas that provide refuge from fishing pressure.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Croft's former band The On <b>Offs</b> broke up. Shortly {{after this}} Crofts and Ben Gordelier worked {{together}} for the first time, recording bass and drums for former On <b>Offs</b> frontman and friend Danny Connors on one of his projects. As a solo artist, Crofts had built up a collection of demos during The On <b>Offs</b> period, and in 2007 he made a Myspace page (under band name 'The Moons') and uploaded a few songs to gain feedback. Within days Lois Wilson of Mojo magazine had praised Croft's song [...] "Intermission Rag" [...] a (Joe Meek esq instrumental) in Mojo magazine. Crofts decided to form The Moons soon after inviting various musicians such as The On <b>Offs</b> drummer Luke Goddard and friends to play when needed.|$|R

5|$|However, <b>off</b> northeastern Brazil, {{the female}} {{reproductive}} cycle is short enough to occur annually. Vitellogenesis (the formation of yolk within the ovary) {{occurs in the}} late summer, and is immediately followed by mating and fertilization in the fall, with the young being born the following spring to summer. The seasonality of these events means the reproductive cycle is offset by six months between populations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The gestation period has been variously estimated at eight months <b>off</b> northeastern Brazil and 911 months <b>off</b> the southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1796, a large {{squadron}} of French frigates {{arrived in the}} Indian Ocean {{under the command of}} Contre-amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey.

Forced to make repairs, Sercey took his squadron to the allied Batavian city of Batavia, sheltering there until January 1797.|$|E
