He {{was honored}} five times for {{excellence}} in consumer reporting by the National Press Club, has received a George Polk Award for Outstanding Local Reporting and a Peabody Award. According to Stossel, {{when he was in}} favor of government intervention and skeptical of business, he was deluged with awards, but in 2006 he stated, [...] "They like me less... <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> applying the same skepticism to government, I stopped winning awards." [...] On April 23, 2012, Stossel was awarded the Chapman University Presidential Medal, by the current president, James Doti, and chancellor, Danielle Struppa. The award has been presented to {{only a handful of people}} over the past 150 years. Stossel received an honorary doctorate from Universidad Francisco Marroquín.|$|E
500|$|... "The {{attraction}} {{to me was}} not only the challenge of writing music portraying characters in a fiction book but the fact that I've had such an intimate connection with L. Ron Hubbard and his work in Scientology for 40 years now. I've been a fan of his fiction for 25 years, and <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> into the act of working with his creations, it had an extra special excitement to me," [...] {{he said in an interview}} with The Washington Post. [...] "Aside from the content in his message, and the fact that he's the founder of the Church of Scientology and Dianetics, the thing I loved about Hubbard was the aesthetics of his writing. There is a musical wavelength to what he does," [...] said Corea to The San Diego Union-Tribune.|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{is known}} for her {{animated}} rapping style, her flow in particular. She often combines metaphors, punch lines and word play into her work, which {{has been compared to}} her mentor Lil Wayne. The New York Times called Minaj [...] "a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones." [...] Although many critics describe her technique as bubblegum rap, Minaj said: [...] "What people don't know is that before I was doing that craziness I was doing me, I was just doing regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> doing all that weird shit—I'm not mad at it because it got everyone's attention." ...|$|E

500|$|Ripken {{has written}} nearly thirty books, {{some of which}} are {{mentioned}} here. After the 1996 season, he released an autobiography titled The Only Way I Know, co-written with Mike Bryan, which was a New York Times bestseller. Following his retirement, he wrote several more, including Play Baseball the Ripken Way: The Complete Illustrated Guide to the Fundamentals, also written by his brother Billy and co-authored by Larry Burke, in 2005. He released the book Parenting Young Athletes the Ripken Way, co-written with Rick Wolff, in 2006 after seeing too many young athletes who he felt were being pressured unnecessarily by their parents. He said, [...] "I was thinking, 'This just creates too much pressure on kids.' They need to find an environment in which they can explore their game... without all these kinds of pressures being brought to bear. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> thinking about it, I saw we had more than enough to fill a book." [...] Then in 2007, he released three books, starting with Coaching Youth Baseball the Ripken Way, also written by his brother Billy and co-authored by Scott Lowe, which highlights 50 practice drills, topics include coaching responsibly, goal setting for youth, and effective practice planning. Later, in April of that year, he released two more books: Get in the Game: 8 Elements of Perseverance That Make the Difference, co-written with Donald T. Phillips, described as a motivational guide to success; and The Longest Season, co-written with Ron Mazellan, a children's book about the Orioles' 1988 season. In 2011, he released Hothead, a children's fiction book co-written with Kevin Cowherd which was also a New York Times bestseller. In addition, he has been writing a weekly youth sports advice newspaper column in the Baltimore Sun since 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{born and}} raised in Devon, Mudge has only ever {{represented}} Scotland at international level, commenting that [...] "t would've been tough to have gone back down south and tried to gain selection there. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> running for Scotland there seemed no point in changing because they gave me my opportunity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of {{the music}} that {{influenced}} the album, YG said, [...] "I always listened to Quik, N.W.A, Snoop, Dre, E-40. I was banging all that. Honestly though the shit I was really listening to was Weezy. I {{think it was the}} type shit he was rapping about and the way he was doing it that made me want to rap more. I have been listening to Doggystyle and The Chronic and even Kendrick's shit a lot more <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> talking about doing an album." [...] He later included 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin' and The Notorious B.I.G.'s Life After Death as albums he had taken influence from for this album.|$|E

Then we'll put on some merengue tune and tango through the studio. We work very quickly. Technically, he's so fast, which really suits me. I don't like to labour over things. In my experience, the first idea is usually the best one. And <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> to think about it, it implodes on itself.|$|R
40|$|A {{first glance}} at {{the title of this}} book might suggest it to be very specialised. Indeed this perhaps {{reflects}} my own expectations before opening it. However, <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> reading it <b>I</b> first realised that the topic in itself has a broad portfolio of applications. For example, the ideas used in this book allow the modelling of movements of people, vehicles or animals. These topics then lead to other application areas – for example, tracking people’s move- ments via mobile phone Global Positioning System (GPS) signals allows monitoring of census-based travel-to-work data or allows novel approaches to the estimation of daytime populations of cities to be carried out...|$|R
2500|$|Billy {{has taken}} part {{in the writing of}} several books {{relating}} to the development of young baseball players.

2500|$|On July 1, 2008, Redden {{signed a}} six-year, $39 million {{contract}} as an unrestricted free agent with the New York Rangers. Redden's performance continued to decline in New York, where he faced considerable criticism — one {{writer for the}} New York Post even called the contract [...] "the worst {{in the history of}} the NHL, if not in the history of hard-cap pro sports." [...] On September 25, 2010, the Rangers placed Redden on waivers in part due to the defenceman's declining play. The move also allowed the Rangers to fit under salary cap. Speaking in 2013 on his stint with the Rangers, Redden said, [...] "I think maybe making that money there and being the player I am… I felt like the first little while, things were going pretty good, and then they kind of fell off. I felt like I wasn’t doing enough, and like I should have been doing more. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> feeling that way, I think I just got away from the things that made me successful. Things just kind of snowballed from there." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{the letter}} had gone still other {{arguments}} I might have added began to occur to me, and I regretted that I had not softened {{some of the}} things I wrote and made others more emphatic. In places argument had degenerated into abject entreaty. Never had my desire been so importunate as now, when I was in continual terror of losing her. Nor could I see how I was to live without her, life lacking a motive being incomprehensible: yet the fire of optimism in me, though died down to ashes, would not be extinguished. At moments it flared up into what almost amounted to a conviction that she could not resist my appeal. I had threatened to go to her, and more than <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> packing....|$|E

[...] Davy was present when Harry received his Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan and also attended Prince Harry's graduation ceremony when he received his flying wings from his father.

6000|$|He shone at {{her like}} a dim blue March moon, and sighed, [...] "No, but I do love the movies. I'm a real fan. One trouble with books is that they're not so {{thoroughly}} safeguarded by intelligent censors as the movies are, and when you drop into the library and take out a book {{you never know what}} you're wasting your time on. What I like in books is a wholesome, really improving story, and sometimes----Why, <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> a novel by this fellow Balzac that you read about, and it told how a lady wasn't living with her husband, I mean she wasn't his wife. It went into details, disgustingly! And the English was real poor. I spoke to the library about it, and they took it off the shelves. I'm not narrow, but I must say I don't see any use in this deliberately dragging in immorality! Life itself is so full of temptations that in literature one wants only that which is pure and uplifting." ...|$|E

5000|$|Clavell {{described}} his process:All I do is write stories. It's {{very difficult to}} get people to read these days with television and the like. My intention is to entertain, perhaps illuminate. If I can transplant people into that buccaneering society of Hong Kong, 1963, maybe they'll get something out of it. If someone pays money for my book and feels satisfied, I'm doing my job.. Writing is rewriting... writing is thinking... If you're lucky, you can start dreaming about a book, and if you're very lucky, you want to wake up... My attitude is positive, romantic. I write about men and women who like men and women. I don't write about psychiatric things, like finding the eternal answer to what is life.The novel was 1,200 pages. It had been reduced 30% with the help of Clavell's editor, Jena Bernkopf. [...] "These things go on until they end," [...] said Clavell about the length. [...] "My secret is I never know what's going to happen from day to day. The last page is all that matters. The rest of it is wind. I only know that <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>start,</b> <b>I</b> will finish... People now tell me it ends too soon." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{assessing}} Fraser's poetry book, I’ve Laughed and Sung Through the Whole Night Long Seen the Summer Sunrise in the Morning, {{the poet}} and critic Louis Dudek wrote: [...] "The poems have wit and a perfectly authentic consistency — a subtle play against a constant background bass of despair or cosmic absurdity.

They are intended to be handed out along with the program and translations at my Recital. These program notes should help the audience learn more about each of the songs I am singing. For each song I have included background information on the composers, the style of music, and (in some cases) background information about the opera from which the song comes. Finally, I included what the song and the music are expressing, and what the singer is attempting to convey during each song. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
