5|$|Their embittered {{season ended}} as many pundits had feared. In the Japanese Grand Prix {{at the end}} of lap 46, Senna made his move at the Casino Chicane. Prost, turning into the corner, turned into his teammate's path {{resulting}} in a collision and the cars sliding interlocked down the escape road. Prost, thinking the World Championship was over, climbed out of his stalled car. To separate the cars, the marshals pushed Senna's McLaren backwards onto the track. This left it in a dangerous position, so they pushed it forwards again. As they did so, Senna bump-started the engine. He drove through the chicane and rejoined. The nose of his car was damaged and he had to pit, but he rejoined only five seconds behind the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini. On lap 50, Ayrton sliced past Nannini at the chicane to take the lead and won the race. But it was Nannini who appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>step</b> of the podium, race officials having excluded Senna for missing the chicane. McLaren appealed the decision, but the FIA Court of Appeal not only upheld the decision but fined Senna US$100,000 and gave him a suspended six-month ban. Thus Prost clinched his third driver's title in controversial circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Though Evans was the {{stronger}} {{of the two}} against the clock, Schleck had surpassed expectations in the long time trial at the 2010 Tour de France, leading to speculation as to whether his 57-second cushion over the Australian could be sufficient for him to win the Tour. Evans rode {{one of the best}} time trials of his career, finishing in second place seven seconds off the pace of Tony Martin, the rider who was crowned world time trial champion later that year. Andy said of his and his brother's rides that they were probably the best time trials likewise of their respective careers, but they were no match for Evans' performance. The Australian was two and a half minutes better than both of them, taking the overall lead by {{a minute and a half}} with Andy slipping to second and Fränk to third. Since the Tour's final stage is traditionally mostly ceremonial save for a final sprint finish, the time trial effectively cemented the final overall standings. Andy took the positive from the result, saying he and his brother were both proud of each other for their efforts and were excited to stand on the podium together in Paris, even if neither of them was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>step.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of a building with forty-two monolithic columns, probably transported by sea, must have seemed incredible to its builders, {{as demonstrated by the}} unusual inscription <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>step</b> on the eastern face dedicated to Apollo, in which the builder (or the architect) celebrates the {{construction of}} the building with an emphasis on the pioneering character of the construction.|$|E

25|$|The season {{concluded}} in Australia, with {{what would be}} Senna's 41st and last F1 career win, {{as well as the}} last win for an active-suspension F1 car (ironically, 1987 had the first victory for such cars also at the hands of Senna in Monaco). The win in Adelaide was an emotional one due to Senna ending his successful career with McLaren and defeating his biggest rival, Prost, for the last time. Because of the Frenchman's imminent retirement from the sport, Senna surprised the F1 community by openly welcoming Prost <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>step</b> of the podium, which many considered a sign of pacification between the duo. Overall, Senna finished the championship second to Prost.|$|E
25|$|He was {{recognized}} as an inspiring speaker. In August 1924, he {{was transferred to the}} Saint Bonaventure convent in Detroit, where he worked until 1945. During this time, he mostly served as the simple porter (or receptionist and doorkeeper). Each Wednesday afternoon, he conducted well-attended services for the sick, and through these services, he became known for his great compassion and the amazing results of his consultations with visitors. People considered him instrumental in cures and other blessings. He loved to kneel before the Eucharist in the quiet of the night; Father Benedict Groeschel once recalled visiting the convent on a warm night and being unable to sleep. Around 3:00am, Groeschel took a walk and arrived at the chapel where he put on two lights and saw Casey kneeling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>step</b> of the altar. Groeschel observed him for several moments and noted that Casey didn't move – Groeschel simply flicked the lights off to leave Casey to his prayer.|$|E

Carly suddenly put two and two together and figured out that Iris set up Carly in order to get her and her baby away from the Tenneys. That meant that Gwen was her half-sister.|$|R

500|$|There {{was again}} some controversy, however, at the , where his teammate, Rubens Barrichello was leading, {{but in the}} final metres of the race, under team orders, slowed down to allow Schumacher to win the race.

At the [...] later that year, Schumacher dominated the race and was set for a close finish with Barrichello. At the end he slowed down to create a formation finish with Barrichello, but slowed too much allowing Barrichello to take the victory. In winning the Drivers' Championship he equalled the record set by Juan Manuel Fangio of five World Championships. Ferrari won 15 out of 17 races, and Schumacher won the title with six races remaining in the season, which is still the earliest point in the season for a driver to be crowned World Champion. Schumacher broke his own record, shared with Nigel Mansell, of nine race wins in a season, by winning eleven times and finishing every race on the podium. He finished with 144 points, a record-breaking 67 points ahead of the runner-up, his teammate Rubens Barrichello. This pair finished nine of the 17 races {{in the first two}} places.|$|E
500|$|After the sprint race, Coletti {{spoke of}} his {{childhood}} dream of hearing the Monegasque national anthem while standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>step</b> of the Monaco podium, [...] "It feels great I mean I’ve seen all the drivers winning here since I was a kid. I’m really, really happy especially that with this win I’ve consolidated my lead in the standings."

Now every new team have had a podium." [...] Quaife-Hobbs believed if he had defended from Coletti on the third lap both drivers would not have entered the Novelle Chicane and affirmed that he elected to follow Coletti with the view for a attack later in the race. Third-place finisher Evans revealed on the formation lap he struggled to get the optimum rear tyre temperature especially {{since the start of}} the race was the best time to gain track position and was aware that finishing on the podium would probably not be realistic. Nevertheless he was happy to have again finished on the Monaco podium after altering his car.|$|E

Finally, they succeeded in pushing a loop in the rope over <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of <b>the</b> block; and then, by main force, eight of them pulled it out of the hole, and lowered it <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>step.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Transportation up the Columbia River {{was like}} {{traversing}} a giant staircase, and the Colonel Wright {{was the first}} boat to run <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>step.</b> This of course {{was the key to}} her money-making ability.

A long portage there began around a series of rapids, generally known by the name of the most important one, which was Celilo Falls. The portage route ended at Celilo, Oregon where the [...] "upper Columbia" [...] began. Steamboats could run from Celilo to Wallula where a stage line, and later a railroad ran to Walla Walla, then the principal settlement in the Inland Empire.
