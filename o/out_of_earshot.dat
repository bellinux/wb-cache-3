25|$|Immediately, Horace states he is {{changing}} his will to leave Alexandra {{everything except the}} railroad bonds which, he will claim, he freely lent to Leo. This story will thwart any attempt by Regina to blackmail her brothers over their theft and will deny her any claim to an ownership stake in the mill. Alexandra is rescued from a larger misfortune, that of marrying the repugnant Leo, by Birdie, the only person able to do so, who wills herself the courage to tell the younger woman not to marry the wrong man (i.e. Leo), lest she bear the consequences {{for the rest of}} her life. Unfortunately, Oscar overhears part of the conversation and, after Alexandra is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>earshot,</b> slaps Birdie hard.|$|E
25|$|Odysseus {{was curious}} {{as to what the}} Sirens sang to him, and so, on the advice of Circe, he had all of his sailors plug their ears with beeswax and tie him to the mast. He ordered his men to leave him tied tightly to the mast, no matter how much he would beg. When he heard their {{beautiful}} song, he ordered the sailors to untie him but they bound him tighter. When they had passed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>earshot,</b> Odysseus demonstrated with his frowns to be released. Some post-Homeric authors state that the Sirens were fated to die if someone heard their singing and escaped them, and that after Odysseus passed by they therefore flung themselves into the water and perished.|$|E

The Swallow veered away to avoid a shoal, making the pirates {{think that she was}} a fleeing merchant ship. The Ranger departed in pursuit, commanded by James Skyrme. Once <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>earshot</b> of the other pirates, the Swallow opened her gun ports and opened fire. Ten pirates were killed and Skyrme had his leg taken off by a cannonball, but he refused to leave the deck. Eventually, the Ranger was forced to strike her colors and the surviving crew were captured.|$|E

Pullo is all for the suggestion, but Vorenus rejects it as dishonorable. The guide tries to ambush Vorenus, and Vorenus stabs him through the throat, alerting Pompey.

25|$|Genie's {{father had}} an {{extremely}} low tolerance {{for any kind}} of noise, refusing to have a working television or radio in the house. Apart from one slightly open window Genie did not have any access to auditory stimuli outside the house, and the window was set well away from the street and other houses, so what little she heard from outside almost exclusively consisted of environmental sounds. Her father never allowed other people in the house, forbade any interaction between Genie and her mother, and forced his son to assist with carrying out his abuse while otherwise preventing him from being in Genie's presence. He did not permit them to speak, and especially not to or around Genie, so any conversations they had were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Genie's <b>earshot,</b> keeping her from hearing any meaningful amount of language.|$|R
2500|$|Basil usually {{turns to}} Manuel or Polly {{to help him}} with his schemes, while trying his best to keep Sybil from {{discovering}} them. However, Basil occasionally laments for the time when there was passion in their relationship, now seemingly lost. Also, it appears he still does care for her, and actively resists the flirtations of a French guest in one episode. The penultimate episode, [...] "The Anniversary", is about his efforts to put together a surprise anniversary party [...] involving their closest friends. Things go wrong as Basil pretends the anniversary date doesn't remind him of anything though he pretends to have a stab at it by reeling off a list of random anniversaries, starting with the Battle of Agincourt, for which he receives a slap from Sybil, who becomes increasingly frustrated and angry. He continues guessing even after Sybil is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>earshot,</b> and mentions other anniversaries (none of which happened on 17 April), including the Battle of Trafalgar and Yom Kippur, just to enhance the surprise. Sybil believes he really has forgotten, and leaves in a huff. In an interview in the DVD box set, Cleese claims this episode deliberately takes a slightly different tone from the others, fleshing out their otherwise inexplicable status as a couple (as well as saying that, if a third series had been made, there would have been similar episodes).|$|E
2500|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{inside the}} house suddenly turned ugly when Dillon asked the teenagers what they felt about the LVF killing of UVF Mid-Ulster brigadier Richard Jameson, {{who had been a}} successful businessman and was extremely popular in the Portadown area. McIlwaine remained silent, however Robb had replied [...] "so fucking what, it's got fuck all to do with me" [...] which Dillon had taken exception to. When he informed Robb that Jameson had been his good friend, Robb had made further disparaging comments which also angered Brown. Brown, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>earshot</b> of the teenagers, had decided to assault Robb in retaliation, saying he would [...] "punch the head off Andrew". Neither Robb nor McIlwaine {{had been a member of}} any loyalist paramilitary organisation, although Robb had tenuous links to the LVF having been an associate of Billy Wright, and even photographed in 1996 at a march led by Wright. Writers Henry McDonald and Ian S. Wood alleged that, unknown to the teenagers, a UVF unit had gone to [...] "The Spot" [...] to seek out two known LVF individuals rumoured to have been involved in Jameson's killing; however, they had already left the nightclub by the time the UVF arrived. The UVF men encountered Robb and McIlwaine instead, and targeted them as LVF members implicated in Jameson's death.|$|E

If they get 200 points or more from the ten answers they win £10,000 for their chosen charity. Also, if they get all five top answers, the money is tripled to £30,000. If they score less than 200 points, those points plus their earlier score would be multiplied by £10.|$|R

Enraged that Kratos {{had failed}} to rescue him sooner and stating he will never forgive him, Deimos attacks and overpowers Kratos. However, Thanatos {{intervenes}} and takes a protesting Deimos to Suicide Bluffs (the site of Kratos' suicide attempt), where Kratos saves Deimos from falling to his death. A grateful Deimos then aids his brother in battling the god with the Arms of Sparta. Thanatos, however, kills Deimos but is destroyed, in turn, by Kratos. Remarking that his brother is finally free, Kratos places Deimos in his grave (leaving the Arms of Sparta as a grave marker), while the gravedigger states that Kratos has become [...] "Death... the Destroyer of Worlds." [...] Athena appears, begs for forgiveness, and offers full godhood for not revealing the truth, but Kratos ignores her and returns to Olympus, promising that [...] "the gods will pay for this."

50|$|Despite the {{prevalence}} of arranged marriages among the Mundugumor, affairs could occur in hopes of spawning marriage or elopement. Because of the stress on arrangement marriage, there was a violent preference for the selection of one's mate. Sexual affairs occurred in the bush <b>of</b> New Guinea, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> eye and <b>earshot</b> <b>of</b> {{other members of the}} tribe. Those who took a lover had to conceal their activity to avoid teasing and disapproval. Sexual affairs involved rough foreplay that began with violent scratching and biting matches to create the maximum amount of excitement. Physical violence was often accompanied by the breaking of the arrows or baskets and ornaments of the beloved to demonstrate the passion that was consumed. Members of both sexes are known and expected to be aggressive in their sexual encounter, but also equally jealous of one another and vengeful of other affairs.|$|R

25|$|Genie's {{father had}} an {{extremely}} low tolerance for noise, {{to the point}} of refusing to have a working television or radio in the house. He almost never allowed his wife or son to speak and viciously beat them if they did so without permission, particularly forbidding them to speak to or around Genie. Any conversation between them was therefore very quiet and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Genie's <b>earshot,</b> preventing her from hearing any meaningful amount of language. Her father kept Genie's room extremely dark, and the only available stimuli were the crib, the chair, curtains on each of the windows, three pieces of furniture, and two plastic rain jackets hanging on the wall. On rare occasions her father allowed her to play with plastic food containers, old spools of thread, TV Guides with many of the illustrations cut out, and the raincoats. The room had two almost entirely blacked-out windows, one which her father left slightly open; although the house was well away from the street and other houses, she could see the side of a neighboring house and a few inches of sky, and occasionally heard environmental sounds or a neighboring child practicing the piano.|$|R

As they’re talking, Serebryakov, Yelena, Sonya, and Telegin return from a walk. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> the professor's <b>earshot,</b> Vanya calls him [...] "a learned old dried mackerel," [...] criticizing him for his pomposity and the smallness of his achievements. Vanya’s mother, Maria Vasilyevna, who idolizes Serebryakov, objects to her son’s derogatory comments. Vanya also praises the professor’s wife, Yelena, for her beauty, arguing that faithfulness to an old man like Serebryakov is an immoral waste of vitality. Astrov is forced to depart to attend a patient, but not before delivering a speech on the preservation of the forests, a subject he is very passionate about. Act I closes with Vanya declaring his love for an exasperated Yelena.|$|R
5000|$|Professor Clarke was not {{a hearty}} laugher. He was known to “ripple” quietly at {{exceptional}} displays of wit or humor. Clarke’s humorous use of language was compared to Lewis Caroll and the talent was renowned at Washington D.C.’s Cosmos Club. Somewhat of a gossip, he specialized in knowing not only what people were currently doing, but also what their forebears had done. Professor Clarke was known for a sharp wit, sometimes employing deadpan. While attending a friend’s Thanksgiving dinner, Clarke noticed the host struggling with that metric of American male performance, the carving of the turkey. Clarke “suggested that it might profit the carver to visit the National Museum, for a certain door therein bears on it the sign ‘Division of Birds’.”A colleague recalled his dining habits at Washington D.C.’s Cosmos Club, “should you join him at lunch and when the waiter has served the butter this man has said, ‘Take it away, please,’ and of the potatoes, ‘Take that away also,’ and should he be eating of sweet potato and some one has remarked to him, ‘Why I thought you did not like potatoes,’ he replies, ‘This is not potato, it is convolvulus [...] [...] [...]”Anger {{was not a}} Clarke character trait. Toward {{the end of his}} life, Professor Clarke was described as “about five feet five inches in height, one hundred and ten pounds in weight, with pale blue eyes, little hair and most of that under his ears, chewing his finger nails and apparently absorbed in thought, though really most alert.” His voice delivered in “[...] [...] a low tone with a well-modulated and quite agreeable voice, using very well-chosen language, talking good sense, but with a mild undertone of gaiety, and you find him bright and entertaining and then you find him clever [...] [...] [...] [...]” [...] In his communications, Professor Clarke exhibited restraint in speaking either negatively or positively of others.

6000|$|Mr. Van Wyk {{all through}} the dinner was {{conscious}} {{of a sense of}} isolation that invades sometimes the closeness of human intercourse. Captain Whalley failed lamentably and obviously in his attempts to eat something. He seemed overcome by a strange absentmindedness. His hand would hover irresolutely, as if left without guidance by a preoccupied mind. Mr. Van Wyk had heard him coming up from a long way off in the profound stillness of the river-side, and had noticed the irresolute character of the footfalls. The toe of his boot had struck the bottom stair as though he had come along mooning with his head in the air right up to the steps of the veranda. Had the captain of the Sofala been another sort of man he would have suspected the work of age there. But one glance at him was enough. Time--after, indeed, marking him for its own--had given him up to his usefulness, in which his simple faith would see a proof of Divine mercy. [...] "How could I contrive to warn him?" [...] Mr. Van Wyk wondered, as if Captain Whalley had been miles and miles away, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight and <b>earshot</b> <b>of</b> all evil. He was sickened by an immense disgust of Sterne. To even mention his threat to a man like Whalley would be positively indecent. There was something more vile and insulting in its hint than in a definite charge of crime--the debasing taint of blackmailing. [...] "What could anyone bring against him?" [...] he asked himself. This was a limpid personality. [...] "And for what object?" [...] The Power that man trusted had thought fit to leave him nothing on earth that envy could lay hold of, except a bare crust of bread.|$|R
