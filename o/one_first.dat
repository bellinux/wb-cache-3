5|$|A {{transfer}} to Manchester City in 1950 meant Barnes turned professional, but his pro career had a slow start, making only <b>one</b> <b>first</b> team appearance in four years.

5|$|Tech {{took over}} at its 13-yard line {{following}} the 63-yard punt but went three {{and out and}} was itself forced to punt.

Needing just inches to gain a first down, Air Force elected to attempt to gain the needed yardage rather than punt the ball away. But before the Falcons could start the play, time ran out in the third quarter. With one quarter remaining, the Falcons still held a 107 lead.|$|E

Facing a fourth down and needing fiveyards for a first down at the Air Force 29-yard line, Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to try to gain the first down instead of trying a long field goal. Bryan Randall was sacked for a loss of 10yards, however, and the Hokies turned the ball over to Air Force after failing to gain the first down.|$|E
5|$|The Vikings won {{the coin}} toss and started {{overtime}} with {{possession of the}} football on their own 29-yard line, but managed to convert only <b>one</b> <b>first</b> down and punted to Atlanta.

On the ensuing drive, Cunningham attempted a deep pass to Moss that was narrowly broken up by Eugene Robinson; had the pass been completed, it most likely {{would have resulted in}} a touchdown and victory for the Vikings. Instead, the Vikings had to punt on 4th down again. The Falcons then drove to the Vikings' 21-yard line, where Morten Andersen converted a 38-yard field goal for the win.|$|E
