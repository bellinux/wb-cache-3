5|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} of GWA studies is the case-control setup, which compares two {{large groups of}} individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped {{for the majority of}} common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more. For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the allele frequency is significantly altered between the case and the control group. In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting effect sizes is the <b>odds</b> <b>ratio.</b> The <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are the odds of disease for individuals having a specific allele and the odds of disease for individuals who do not have that same allele. When the allele frequency in the case group is much higher than in the control group, the <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a P-value for the significance of the <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> is typically calculated using a simple chi-squared test. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.|$|E
5|$|A {{central point}} of debate on GWA studies {{has been that}} most of the SNP {{variations}} found by GWA studies are associated with only a small increased risk of the disease, and have only a small predictive value. The median <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> is 1.33 per risk-SNP, with only a few showing odds ratios above 3.0. These magnitudes are considered small because they do not explain much of the heritable variation. This heritable variation is known from heritability studies based on monozygotic twins. For example, it is known that 80-90% of variance in height can be explained by hereditary differences, but GWA studies only account for a minority of this variance.|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{reporting}} results of case-control studies, <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> are useful methods of reporting fi ndings. However, <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> are often misinterpreted {{in the literature}} and by general readers. Methods: We searched all original articles which {{were published in the}} Korean Journal of Family Medicine from 1980 to May 2011 and identifi ed those that report "odds ratios. " Misinterpretation of <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> as relative risks has been identifi ed. Estimated risk ratios were calculated when possible and compared with <b>odds</b> <b>ratios.</b> Results: One hundred and twenty-eight articles using <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> were identifi ed. Among those, 122 articles were analyzed for the frequency of misinterpretation of <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> as relative risks. Twenty-two reports out of these 122 articles misinterpreted <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> as relative risks. Th e percentage of misinterpreting reports decreased over years. Seventy-seven reports were analyzed to compare the estimated risk <b>ratios</b> with <b>odds</b> <b>ratios.</b> In most of these articles, <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> were greater than estimated risk ratios, 60 % of which had larger than 20 % standardized diff erences. Conclusion: In reports published in the Korean Journal of Family Medicine, <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> are frequently used. They were misinterpreted in part of the reports, although decreasing trends over years were observed...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveIn some respects, outcome {{reporting}} in valvular surgery has been hampered {{by focusing on}} specific populations, reluctance to publish high-risk subgroups, and possibly skewed or inadequate samples. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate risk factors for operative mortality comprehensively across the entire spectrum of cardiac valvular procedures over the past decade. MethodsAll 409, 904 valve procedures in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database performed between 1994 and 2003 were assessed, and Society of Thoracic Surgeons preoperative and operative variables were related to operative mortality by using a multivariable logistic regression model. Data were greater than 95 % complete, and the relative importance of relevant risk factors was determined by ranking <b>odds</b> <b>ratios.</b> The analysis had a high predictive power, with a C statistic of 0. 735. ResultsIn the model, 19 variables independently influenced operative mortality (all P <. 01). The most significant was nonelective (acute) presentation (<b>odds</b> <b>ratios,</b> 2. 11), followed by advanced age (<b>odds</b> <b>ratios,</b> 1. 88), reoperation (<b>odds</b> <b>ratios,</b> 1. 61), endocarditis (<b>odds</b> <b>ratios,</b> 1. 59), and coronary disease (<b>odds</b> <b>ratios,</b> 1. 58). Generally, valve replacement was associated with higher mortality than repair (<b>odds</b> <b>ratios,</b> 1. 52). Overall, female gender was very important (<b>odds</b> <b>ratios,</b> 1. 37), and earlier year of operation increased risk (<b>odds</b> <b>ratios,</b> 1. 34), implying improving outcomes over time. Although any single comorbidity, on average, was only moderately contributory (<b>odds</b> <b>ratios,</b> 1. 19), specific comorbidities, such as renal failure, or multiple comorbidities in a given patient could be very significant. Aortic root reconstruction carried the highest risk (<b>odds</b> <b>ratios,</b> 2. 78), followed by tricuspid valve surgery (<b>odds</b> <b>ratios,</b> 2. 26), multiple valve procedures (<b>odds</b> <b>ratios,</b> 2. 06), and then isolated mitral (<b>odds</b> <b>ratios,</b> 1. 47), pulmonic (<b>odds</b> <b>ratios,</b> 1. 29), and aortic (reference procedure) operations. Reduced ejection fraction and severity of valve lesion were relatively less important (<b>odds</b> <b>ratios,</b> 1. 34 and 0. 83, respectively). ConclusionsThese data illustrate the significance of acute presentation in determining operative risk, and earlier surgical intervention under elective conditions might be emphasized for all types of significant valve lesions. Because aortic root reconstruction doubles mortality compared with simple aortic valve procedures, root replacement should be reserved for specific root pathology. Finally, issues related to reoperation, endocarditis, valve repair, gender, and the various procedures deserve more detailed examination...|$|R

The largest adjusted prevalence <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> for all symptoms, particularly hot flashes or night sweats (<b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> = 2. 06 – 4. 32), were for women who were peri- or postmenopausal.

40|$|Interaction {{measured}} on the additive scale {{has been argued}} to be better correlated with biologic interaction than when {{measured on}} the multiplicative scale. Measures of interaction on the additive scale have been developed using risk ratios. However, in studies that use <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> as the sole measure of effect, the calculation of these measures of additive interaction is usually performed by directly substituting <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> for risk ratios. Yet assessing additive interaction based on replacing risk <b>ratios</b> by <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> in formulas that were derived using the former may be erroneous. In this paper, we evaluate {{the extent to which}} three measures of additive interaction – the interaction contrast ratio (ICR), the attributable proportion due to interaction (AP), and the synergy index (S), estimated using <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> versus using risk ratios differ as the incidence of the outcome of interest increases in the source population and/or as the magnitude of interaction increases. Our analysis shows that {{the difference between the two}} depends on the measure of interaction used, the type of interaction present, and the baseline incidence of the outcome. Substituting <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> for risk ratios, when calculating measures of additive interaction, may result in misleading conclusions. Of the three measures, AP appears to be the most robust to this direct substitution. Formulas that use stratum specific <b>odds</b> and <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> to accurately calculate measures of additive interaction are presented...|$|R

Analysis of never and current smokers included 6, 333 cases, while analysis of never drinkers and consumers of ≤ 10 drinks/day included 8, 452 cases.

Breast-feeding dose (ratio of breast-feedings to other feedings) was categorized as full, most, equal, less, or no breast-feeding. RESULTS: Compared with no breast-feeding, full breast-feeding infants had lower <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> of diarrhea, cough or wheeze, and vomiting and lower mean ratios of illness months and sick baby medical visits.
