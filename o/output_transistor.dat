25|$|The {{impedance}} seen by {{the load}} needs further discussion. The load in Figure 5 {{is connected to the}} collector of the <b>output</b> <b>transistor,</b> and therefore is separated from the body of the amplifier by the infinite impedance of the output current source. Therefore, feedback has no effect on the output impedance, which remains simply RC2 as {{seen by the}} load resistor RL in Figure 3. AOL) requires care, particularly for the case of output impedance using series feedback. See Jaeger, note below.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} view is {{that the}} voltage at the top of R2 is set by the emitter current of the <b>output</b> <b>transistor.</b> That view leads to an entirely passive feedback network made up of R2 and Rf. The variable controlling the feedback is the emitter current, so the feedback is a current-controlled current source (CCCS). We search through the four available two-port networks and find the only one with a CCCS is the g-parameter two-port, shown in Figure 4. The next task is to select the g-parameters so that the two-port of Figure 4 is electrically equivalent to the L-section made up of R2 and Rf. That selection is an algebraic procedure made most simply by looking at two individual cases: the case with V1 = 0, which makes the VCVS {{on the right side of}} the two-port a short-circuit; and the case with I2 = 0. which makes the CCCS on the left side an open circuit. The algebra in these two cases is simple, much easier than solving for all variables at once. The choice of g-parameters that make the two-port and the L-section behave the same way are shown in the table below.|$|E

50|$|Another {{practice}} is {{to mount a}} thermal feedback sensing transistor or other device on the heat sink, to control the crossover bias voltage. As the <b>output</b> <b>transistors</b> heat up, so does the thermal feedback transistor.

50|$|This design {{automatically}} stabilizes {{its operating}} point, since overall feedback internally operates from DC {{up through the}} audio range and beyond. The use of fixed diode bias requires the diodes to be both electrically and thermally matched to the <b>output</b> <b>transistors.</b> If the <b>output</b> <b>transistors</b> conduct too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage.|$|R

50|$|According to Eq. 4, {{the output}} {{resistance}} of the Widlar current source is increased over that of the <b>output</b> <b>transistor</b> itself (which is rO) so long as R2 is large enough compared to the rπ of the <b>output</b> <b>transistor</b> (large resistances R2 make the factor multiplying rO approach the value (β +1)). The <b>output</b> <b>transistor</b> carries a low current, making rπ large, and increase in R2 tends to reduce this current further, causing a correlated increase in rπ. Therefore, a goal of R2 >> rπ can be unrealistic, and further discussion is provided below.

25|$|This {{design is}} simple, {{but a good}} basis for a {{practical}} design because it automatically stabilises its operating point, since feedback internally operates from DC up through the audio range and beyond. Further circuit elements would probably {{be found in a}} real design that would roll-off the frequency response above the needed range to prevent the possibility of unwanted oscillation. Also, the use of fixed diode bias as shown here can cause problems if the diodes are not both electrically and thermally matched to the <b>output</b> <b>transistors</b> if the <b>output</b> <b>transistors</b> turn on too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage.|$|R
50|$|The prime {{purpose of}} foldback current {{limiting}} in linear power supplies {{is to keep}} the <b>output</b> <b>transistor</b> within its safe power dissipation limit.With a linear voltage regulator, the output voltage Vout and output current Iout are maintained by simply dissipating away the surplus of input voltage Vin:Under overload conditions the output voltage falls and so the difference Vin - Vout becomes larger, tending to increasing dissipation. For a simple current limit, safely handling the worst-case scenario (a short circuit) would therefore require a much larger heatsink and <b>output</b> <b>transistor</b> than would be required under normal operating conditions. Foldback partially solves this, helping to keep the normal-rated <b>output</b> <b>transistor</b> within its safe operating area under fault and overload conditions. Foldback also significantly reduces the power dissipation in the load in fault conditions, which can reduce the risks of fire and heat damage.|$|E

50|$|An input logical zero. Note {{that the}} base-collector {{junction}} of the multiple-emitter transistor and the base-emitter junction of the <b>output</b> <b>transistor</b> are in series between {{the bottom of}} the resistor and ground. If one input voltage becomes zero, the corresponding base-emitter junction of the multiple-emitter transistor is in parallel with these two junctions. A phenomenon called current steering means that when two voltage-stable elements with different threshold voltages are connected in parallel, the current flows through the path with the smaller threshold voltage. That is, current flows out of this input and into the zero (low) voltage source. As a result, no current flows through the base of the <b>output</b> <b>transistor,</b> causing it to stop conducting and the output voltage becomes high (logical one). During the transition the input transistor is briefly in its active region; so it draws a large current away {{from the base of the}} <b>output</b> <b>transistor</b> and thus quickly discharges its base. This is a critical advantage of TTL over DTL that speeds up the transition over a diode input structure.|$|E
