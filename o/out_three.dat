5|$|There are two new battle mechanics: Triple Battles and Rotation Battles. In Triple Battles, {{both teams}} must send <b>out</b> <b>three</b> Pokémon {{in a row}} at once; Pokémon on {{the left or right}} side can only attack the opponent's Pokémon on the same side or in the center. Changing {{position}} takes up one turn. In Rotation Battles, each side sends <b>out</b> <b>three</b> Pokémon at once, but they are arranged in a circle that can be rotated at will. Black has more Rotation Battles than Triple Battles, and the opposite is true in White. Another introduction is Combination Moves: a starter Pokémon can be taught one of three moves, and using them together in Double or Triple battles produces more powerful attacks. In the wild, walking through different-colored tall grass can trigger Double Battles against wild Pokémon rather than only Single Battles as usual.|$|E

5|$|Born in the Adelaide {{suburb of}} Medindie, South Australia, Derrick left {{school at the}} age of {{fourteen}} and found work in a bakery. As the Great Depression grew worse he lost his job and moved to Berri, working on a fruit farm before marrying in 1939. In July 1941, Derrick enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force, joining the 2/48th Battalion. He was posted to the Middle East, where he took part in the Siege of Tobruk, was recommended for the Military Medal and promoted to corporal. Later, at El Alamein, Derrick was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for knocking <b>out</b> <b>three</b> German machine gun posts, destroying two tanks, and capturing one hundred prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Central to the 2009 dispute was the {{agreement}} that ended the 2007 round of strikes.

However, the Communication Workers Union said that although Royal Mail had carried <b>out</b> <b>three</b> of the phases in this way, it had refused to discuss the final phase, which concerned the government's plans for modernisation, and how these would affect the job security of Royal Mail employees.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Saggers had few {{opportunities}} with the bat, generally batting between No. 8 and No. 10,N- because Australia's frontline bowlers included {{the likes of}} Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, who were all capable batsmen. Lindwall scored two Test centuries in his career, while McCool scored 18 first-class centuries, one in Tests. Johnson and Ring both scored more than 20 fifties at first-class level. As a result, many of the bowlers batted before he did. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions, Saggers only had 12 innings in his 17 first-class fixtures and was not <b>out</b> <b>three</b> times after his remaining partners had been dismissed.|$|E

He {{was called}} up to the major league club in July after posting a 1–1 record with a 5.45 ERA and 14 strikeouts, working exclusively from Baltimore's bullpen. Hansen's first appearance with Philadelphia came on July 6; he pitched two innings in relief of Russ Meyer, who allowed three runs without recording an <b>out.</b> <b>Three</b> straight appearances in doubleheader openers followed Hansen's Phillies debut: he faced two Cardinals batters without a putout on July 15; pitched two scoreless innings against Cincinnati two days later; and could have earned his first victory of the season on July 22 had Konstanty—the closer and 1950's National League Most Valuable Player—not collected his fifth blown save of the year. Hansen pitched in three more games that month, recording his first decision of the season on July's final day: he defeated the Reds, 7–5, pitching one inning and allowing two runs.|$|E
5|$|An immaculate inning {{occurs in}} {{baseball}} when a pitcher in a half-inning of play throws only nine pitches, {{each of which}} is a strike and thus strikes <b>out</b> <b>three</b> consecutive batters. Immaculate innings are uncommon, rarer than the better known individual gameplay feats of a batter's hitting for the cycle and a pitcher's no hitter. Currently 84 different Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers have accomplished this feat for a total of 89 immaculate innings. The first one was pitched by John Clarkson of the Boston Beaneaters on June 4, 1889, in the third inning against the Philadelphia Quakers. Since then, only four players––Lefty Grove, Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, and Sandy Koufax––have thrown an immaculate inning more than once in their careers. Koufax is the only pitcher to throw three of them. A record eight immaculate innings have been thrown in the 2017 MLB season through August 8.|$|E

2500|$|Three-way coin flips {{are also}} possible, by a {{different}} process – {{this can be done}} either to choose two <b>out</b> of <b>three,</b> or to choose one <b>out</b> of <b>three.</b> To choose two <b>out</b> of <b>three,</b> three coins are flipped, and if two coins come up the same and one different, the different one loses (is out), leaving two players.
