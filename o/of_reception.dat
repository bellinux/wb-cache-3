5|$|The late 18th {{century was}} a period of change in the {{interior}} design of English country houses. The Baroque concept of the principal floor, or piano nobile, with a large bedroom suite known as the state apartments, was gradually abandoned in favour of smaller, more private bedrooms on the upper floors. The principal floor became a series <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> rooms, each with a designated purpose, creating separate withdrawing, dining, music, and ballrooms. In the late-18th century, it became common to arrange reception and public rooms on a lower floor, with bedrooms and more private rooms above. West Wycombe perfectly reflects this arrangement.|$|E
5|$|The {{telescope}} also {{tracked the}} Soviet moon probes, including Lunik II from 13 to 14 September 1959 as {{it hit the}} moon; this was proven by the telescope by measuring {{the effect of the}} moon's gravity on the probe,Piper, Story of Jodrell Bank, p. 42Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, pp. 269–271 and Luna 3 around 4 October 1959.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 271 Also, the telescope tracked Luna 9 in February 1966, the first spacecraft to make a soft landing on the Moon. The telescope listened in on its facsimile transmission of photographs from the moon's surface. The photos were sent to the British press – the probe transmitted, likely intentionally to increase chances <b>of</b> <b>reception,</b> in the international format for image transmission by newswire – and published before the Soviets themselves had made the photos public.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{interior}} design of Norfolk House was {{to define the}} London town house for the next century. The floor plan {{was based on an}} adaptation of one of the secondary wings he had built at Holkham Hall. A circuit <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> rooms centred on a grand staircase, with the staircase hall replacing the Italian traditional inner courtyard or two-storey hall. This arrangement of salons allowed guests at large parties to circulate, having been received {{at the head of the}} staircase, without doubling back on arriving guests. The second advantage was that while each room had access to the next, it also had access to the central stairs, thus allowing only one or two rooms to be used at a time for smaller functions. Previously, guests in London houses had had to reach the principal salon through a long enfilade of minor reception rooms. In this square and compact way, Brettingham came close to recreating the layout of an original Palladian Villa. He transformed what Andrea Palladio had conceived as a country retreat into a London mansion appropriate for the lifestyle of the British aristocracy, with its reversal of the usual Italian domestic pattern of a large palazzo in town, and a smaller villa in the country. As happened so often in Brettingham's career, Robert Adam later developed this design concept further, and was credited with its success. However, Brettingham's plan for Norfolk House was to serve as the prototype for many London mansions over the next few decades.|$|E
