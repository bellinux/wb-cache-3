50|$|HCR is a psychology/cognitive {{modelling}} {{approach to}} HRA developed by Hannaman et al. in 1984.

When they spread over a wide area of the grid, they are referred to as cascading outages — the uncontrolled successive loss of system elements triggered by an incident at any location.

In late April, Amtrak accepted six of the leased cars for revenue service, which permitted an increase to 14 round trips on May 1. An additional pair of cars were sent for rebuild later in the year.In October 1973, Amtrak placed an order for 57 Amfleet coaches, the first of what would ultimately be a fleet of over 600. Although the Metroliner propulsion systems had proved unsuccessful, the carbodies were well-liked, and the Amfleet cars had the same basic structure. By November, the first two rebuilt cars had been completed and were waiting for legal agreements to enter testing. The dynamic braking resistors and the air intakes were relocated to a streamlined bump on the roof, reducing overheating and snow ingestion issues that had occurred when they were mounted under the carbody. The rebuilt cars had a maximum speed of 130 mph. Two additional cars were completed by February 1974. All four rebuilt cars were tested at up to 150 mph in May and returned to revenue service as a four-car set on July 1. The rebuilding was largely successful except for continued issues with rough-riding trucks, but it cost $500k per car - more than the original cost of $450k each.|$|E
