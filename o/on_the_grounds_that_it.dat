5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or {{the meaning of}} life.

At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Old Court {{supporters}} again {{raised the}} issue of Sharp's seduction and abandonment of Anna Cooke.

Whether Sharp made such a claim has never been determined. Despite the allegations, Sharp won the election.|$|E

50|$|As psychoanalysts {{continued}} {{to explore the}} glossed of unconscious motives, Otto Fenichel distinguished different sorts of rationalization—both the justifying of irrational instinctive actions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> they were reasonable or normatively validated, and the rationalizing of defensive structures, whose purpose is unknown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> they have some quite different but somehow logical meaning.|$|R
5|$|In 2004, four {{female athletes}} – Anette Sagen, Helena Olsson Smeby, Line Jahr, and Lindsey Van – {{were invited to}} perform test jumps prior to the men's 2004 Continental Cup event in Vikersund. However, this was {{initially}} blocked by Torbjørn Yggeseth, founder of the Ski Jumping World Cup {{and a member of}} the FIS technical committee at the time, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was too dangerous to allow women on ski flying hills. Sagen challenged this and eventually won the right to jump from the hill, along with her fellow athletes. Both Sagen and Smeby jumped , which remains the third longest distance for women.|$|E

The South American country annulled a contract with the oil firm <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> violated a clause that the company would not sell its rights to another firm without permission. The tribunal agreed the violation took place but judged that the annulment was not fair and equitable treatment to the company.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the second investigation, a case was being prepared against Det Ch Supt Melvin and Det Insp Dingle. In July 1992 Melvin was charged with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and Dingle with conspiracy. In 1994 their lawyers applied for access to information from Nove's inquiry, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might help their clients; anything that implicated Winston Silcott would support the detectives' contention that their interview notes were genuine and that Silcott really had, in effect, confessed. The lawyers also argued that the detectives should not be prosecuted until all related criminal proceedings had concluded.|$|E
50|$|This {{conviction}} was quashed in July 2004 by the Court of Criminal Appeal <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> had {{new evidence}} of bank accounts {{been available to}} the trial jury they might have had raised doubts therefore rendering the conviction unsafe.

5|$|Operation Dragoon was {{controversial}} {{from the}} time it was first proposed. The American military leadership and its British counterparts disagreed on the operation. Winston Churchill argued against it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> diverted military resources that were better deployed for Allied operations in Italy; instead, he favored an invasion of the oil-producing regions of the Balkans. Churchill reasoned that by attacking the Balkans, the Western Allies could deny Germany petroleum, forestall the advance of the Red Army of the Soviet Union, and achieve a superior negotiating position in post-war Europe, all at a stroke.|$|E

The latter restriction was justified <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would reduce noise pollution and prevent one speaker from drowning out another one, and that it also applied to Speakers' Corner in London.|$|E

In 1839, Crown Prince Frederik deposited Falbe's daguerreotypes with Ørsted, {{the secretary of}} the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, despite the fact that Daguerre, the inventor, was an artist. In 1842, the artist Johan Frederik Møller was refused a grant from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts for studying photography in France <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not an art.
