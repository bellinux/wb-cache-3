The coat of males shows two-tone colouration: while the upper parts and <b>outsides</b> of the legs are dark brown to black, the underparts and the insides of the legs are all white. Darkness typically increases as the male ages. On the other hand, females and juveniles are yellowish fawn to tan. In Texas, blackbuck moult in spring, following which the males look notably lighter, though darkness persists on the face and the legs. On the contrary, males will grow darker as the breeding season approaches. Both melanism and albinism have been observed in wild blackbuck. Albino blackbuck are often zoo attractions as in the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (Andhra Pradesh, India).|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{natural and}} cheap way of {{increasing}} children's physical activity is stimulating unstructured <b>outside</b> play. Purpose: This study examined whether {{characteristics of the}} family and perceived physical environment were associated with the duration of children's <b>outside</b> play. Methods: Parents participating in the " Be Active, Eat Right" cluster RCT control group (N = 2007) provided information on potential predictors of <b>outside</b> play (i. e. family and perceived physical environment) of their 5 -year-old child by questionnaire. Child <b>outside</b> play was assessed by parental reports both at five and seven years. Linear regression analyses, adjusted for seasonality, were performed to evaluate associations between potential predictors and child <b>outside</b> play. Linear mixed models were fitted to evaluate the relationship between potential predictors and the development of <b>outside</b> play over two years, with season entered as a random factor. Results: Family environment was the strongest construct predicting child <b>outside</b> play, while parent perceived physical environment had no significant association with child <b>outside</b> play. Parental habit strength and the presence of rules were the strongest predictors of increased <b>outside</b> play. Parent perceived difficulty in improving child <b>outside</b> play was the strongest predictor of decreased <b>outside</b> play. Conclusion: Family environment predicted child <b>outside</b> play and not perceived physical environment. Parental rules and habit strength regarding improving <b>outside</b> play were associated with an improvement of child's engagement in <b>outside</b> play. © 2014 Remmers et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R

500|$|The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum in Hong Kong {{displays}} a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of Jiaxiang County, Shandong {{are the most}} important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones. [...] The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescoes of the period. [...] A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing. [...] After the introduction of Buddhism, carved [...] "funerary couches" [...] featured similar scenes, now mostly religious. During the Han Dynasty, miniature ceramic models of buildings were often made to accompany the deceased in the graves; to them is owed much of what is known of ancient Chinese architecture. Later, during the Six Dynasties, sculptural miniatures depicting buildings, monuments, people and animals adorned the tops of the hunping funerary vessels. [...] The <b>outsides</b> of tombs often featured monumental brick or stone-carved pillar-gates (que 闕); an example from 121CE appears to be the earliest surviving Chinese architectural structure standing above ground. [...] Tombs of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) are often rich in glazed pottery figurines of horses, servants and other subjects, whose forceful and free style is greatly admired today. The tomb art reached its peak in the Song and Jin periods; most spectacular tombs were built by rich commoners.|$|E
