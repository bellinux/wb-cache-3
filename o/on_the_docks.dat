5|$|Prior to the Presidential Election of 1872 two {{congressional and}} one Treasury Department {{investigations}} {{took place over}} corruption at the New York Custom House under Grant collector appointments Moses H.

Leet, was allegedly involved with exorbitant pricing for storing goods and splitting the profits. Grant's third collector appointment, Chester A. Arthur, implemented Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell's reform to keep the goods protected <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> rather than private storage.|$|E
