5|$|In English law, secret trusts are a {{class of}} trust defined as an {{arrangement}} between a testator and a trustee, made to come into force after death, that aims to benefit a person without having been written in a formal will. The property {{is given to the}} trustee in the will, and he would then be expected to pass it on to the real beneficiary. For these to be valid, the person seeking to enforce the trust must prove that the testator intended to form a trust, that this intention was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee accepted his office. There are two types of secret trust — fully secret and half-secret. A fully secret trust is one with no mention in the will whatsoever. In the case of a half-secret trust, the face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> names the trustee as trustee, but does not give the trust's terms, including the beneficiary. The most important difference lies in communication of the trust: the terms of a half-secret trust must be communicated to the trustee before the execution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>will,</b> whereas {{in the case of a}} fully secret trust the terms may be communicated after the execution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>will,</b> as long as this is before the testator's death.|$|E

Hues was also required to help price Harriot's books and other possessions for sale to the Bodleian Library.|$|E

5|$|Wagner {{had been}} greatly {{impressed}} with his reading of Arthur Schopenhauer in 1854, and this deeply affected his thoughts and practice on music and art. Some writers (e.g. Bryan Magee) see Parsifal as Wagner's last great espousal of Schopenhauerian philosophy. Parsifal can heal Amfortas and redeem Kundry because he shows compassion, which Schopenhauer saw as the highest form of human morality. Moreover, he displays compassion {{in the face of}} sexual temptation (act 2, scene 3). Schopenhaurian philosophy also suggests that the only escape from the ever-present temptations of human life is through negation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Will,</b> and overcoming sexual temptation is in particular a strong form of negation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Will.</b> When viewed in this light, Parsifal, with its emphasis on Mitleid ("compassion") is a natural follow-on to Tristan und Isolde, where Schopenhauer's influence is perhaps more obvious, with its focus on Sehnen ("yearning"). Indeed, Wagner originally considered including Parsifal as a character in act 3 of Tristan, but later rejected the idea.|$|E
5|$|Barley himself {{published}} {{four books}} under his patent. In March 1612, one of Barley's servants died, possibly from plague. After receiving charitable remuneration from the Stationers' Company, Barley moved, {{first to the}} parish of St Katherine Cree, and later to a house on Bishopsgate. Records from St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate indicate his burial on 11 July 1614. His widow, Mary, and their son, William, were legatees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> of Pavier. Mary Barley, who later remarried, transferred five of her husband's patents to printer John Beale. Some of Barley's remaining copyrights may have also been passed to the printer Thomas Snodham.|$|E

5|$|German cinema {{has made}} major {{technical}} and artistic contributions to film. The first {{works of the}} Skladanowsky Brothers were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned Babelsberg Studio in Berlin's suburb Potsdam was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world. Today it is Europe's largest studio. Other early and still active studios include UFA and Bavaria Film. Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Director Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) {{is referred to as}} the first major science-fiction film. In 1930 Josef von Sternberg directed The Blue Angel, the first major German sound film, with Marlene Dietrich. Films of Leni Riefenstahl set new artistic standards, in particular Triumph <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Will.</b>|$|E
5|$|Having {{seen the}} court through the Old Court-New Court controversy, Chief Justice Boyle {{resigned}} in 1826. In December 1828, Mills and Owsley also resigned. Their resignations were {{an attempt to}} silence criticism from the defeated New Court faction that they held their seats in defiance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> of the people. Old Court supporters hoped both men would be re-nominated and re-confirmed by the legislature, making the New Court's charge less credible. Accordingly, newly elected governor Thomas Metcalfe submitted both men to the legislature for confirmation, but the nominations were defeated in the state senate. Thus ended Owsley's tenure on the court. It was, at the time, the longest tenure of any Court of Appeals justice except John Boyle. Owsley returned to his legal practice, and his case load soon compelled him to move to Frankfort.|$|E
5|$|Kanaʻina {{acted as}} {{trustee of the}} royal lands that had been {{inherited}} by his wife while his son was a minor, and after his son's death. When Kanaina died, the court appointed nine trustees, six of which would {{take part in the}} militia that overthrew the monarchy and also take part in the new provisional government. Dole himself had been on the record as supporting the break up of crown lands to promote American style farming in his newspaper in 1872. Various lawsuits ensued over the property including a suit questioning the validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> due to Lunalilo being under the guardianship of his father when he made it out. Lunalilo had requested in his will to use the estate to fund a charity. The trustees favored splitting up the estate by selling it off, while others claimed the value of land was underestimated, and an endowment to run the charity could have been funded by lease income. For example, Kanaʻina leased (and later his heirs would sell) thousands of acres of land on the island of Hawaii to businessman (and son of missionaries) William Herbert Shipman.|$|E
