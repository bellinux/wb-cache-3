5|$|The mosaics of Delos form a {{significant}} corpus <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> ancient Greek mosaic art. Most {{of the surviving}} mosaic artworks from Delos, Greece, {{an island in the}} Cyclades, date to {{the last half of the}} 2nd century BC and early 1st century BC, during the Hellenistic period and beginning of the Roman period of Greece. Hellenistic mosaics were no longer produced after roughly 69 BC, due to warfare with the Kingdom of Pontus and subsequently abrupt decline of the island's population and position as a major trading center. Among Hellenistic Greek archaeological sites, Delos contains one of the highest concentrations <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> mosaic artworks as well as rare Greek wall paintings.|$|E

5|$|As {{many more}} {{individuals}} of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, {{there is a}} frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, {{will have a better}} chance <b>of</b> <b>surviving,</b> and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the paucity}} <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> {{attributed}} works, {{it is difficult}} to detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, suggesting that the more advanced Presentation in the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E

Cockroaches can withstand extremely cold temperatures, allowing them to live in the Arctic. Some species are capable <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> temperatures of −188°F (−122°C) by manufacturing an antifreeze made out of glycerol. In North America, 50 species separated into five families are found throughout the continent. 450 species are found in Australia.

Writer Joseph Staten resolved to create a simple story to enhance an emotional backdrop more grounded in complexity.|$|E
5|$|Due to lack <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> documentation, it is {{difficult}} to attribute unsigned works from the period with any degree of certainty. The origin of the Crucifix has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicolò Albertini. It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period. According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at Pisa, Tuscany that established his reputation.|$|E

Elephant poaching, particularly {{in the south of}} the country in areas such as Zakouma National Park, is a severe problem.

5|$|In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne {{considered}} {{the case of}} the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective. He suggested that they had in fact been pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> to adulthood.|$|E
