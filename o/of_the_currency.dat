5|$|After the referendum, Lukashenko {{convened a}} new {{parliamentary}} assembly from those {{members of the}} parliament who were loyal to him. After between ten and twelve deputies withdrew their signature from the impeachment petition, only about forty deputies of the old parliament were left and the Supreme Soviet was dismissed by Lukashenko. Nevertheless, international organizations and many Western countries do not recognize the current parliament given {{the way it was}} formed. At the start of 1998, the Central Bank of Russia suspended trading in the Belarusian ruble, which led to a collapse in the value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>currency.</b> Lukashenko responded by taking control of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, sacking the entire bank leadership and blaming the West for the free fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>currency.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{accordance}} with the plan for decimalisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> (120 years after this denomination was first introduced in the initial plan to introduce a decimal currency), from 1968 the ten pence coin was introduced of the same size, weight and metal composition as the florin. Thus, the florin ceased to be struck for circulation after the 1967-dated pieces. The new and the old circulated side by side as florins prior to Decimal Day (15 February 1971) and as ten pence pieces after.|$|E
5|$|The coins met {{a hostile}} {{reception}} {{from the business}} community in Honolulu, who feared inflation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> {{in a time of}} recession. After legal maneuvering, the government agreed to use over half of the coinage as backing for paper currency, and this continued until better economic times began in 1885. After that, the coins were more eagerly accepted in circulation. They remained in the flow of commerce on the islands until withdrawn in 1903, after Hawaii had become a US territory.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{began his}} term with many {{economic}} problems. The foreign debt was nearly 43billion dollars {{by the end}} of the year, and the country had narrowly prevented a sovereign default in 1982. During that year, the gross domestic product fell by 5.6%, and the manufacturing profits by 55%. Unemployment was at nearly 10%, and inflation was nearly 209%. It also appeared unlikely that the country would receive the needed foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7billion. Possible solutions such as a devaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>currency,</b> privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, would probably have proven to be unpopular.|$|E

40|$|A trading-post {{model of}} money is used to show how {{exchange}} rates can be affected by extrinsic uncertainty. With no uncertainty in fundamentals, we demonstrate that there exist equilibria where exchange rates as well as consumption allocations follow a stationary random process.

Then, the only stationary equilibria in which both monies are valued are those with uctuations: <b>the</b> real value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>currencies</b> follow a stationary process, and the average return on <b>the</b> fast-growing <b>currency</b> is lower than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slow-growing <b>currency.</b> (Copyright: Elsevier) ...|$|R
5|$|In January 2002 Eduardo Duhalde was {{appointed}} president, becoming Argentina's fifth president in two weeks. Roberto Lavagna, who became Minister of the Economy in April 2002, was credited for the ensuing {{recovery of the}} economy, having stabilised prices and the exchange rate in a moment when Argentina was at risk of hyperinflation. Since the default in 2001, growth has resumed, with the Argentine economy growing by over 6% a year for seven of the eight years to 2011. This was achieved {{in part because of}} a commodity price boom, and also because the government managed to keep the value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> low, boosting industrial exports.|$|E
5|$|The {{blockade}} of the South caused the Southern economy to collapse during the war. Shortages {{of food and}} supplies were caused by the blockade, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, and foraging by Union and Confederate armies. The standard of living fell even as large-scale printing of paper money caused inflation and distrust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>currency.</b> By 1864 the internal food distribution had broken down, leaving cities without enough food and causing food riots across the Confederacy. The Union victory at the Second Battle of Fort Fisher in January 1865 closed the last useful Southern port, virtually ending blockade running and hastening {{the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The {{drive for}} decimalisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> in Britain dates {{as far back}} as 1682. Although nothing was done {{regarding}} early proposals, the adoption of a decimal currency in the United States, France and other nations in the late 18th and early 19th centuries renewed the call, and commissions in 1841 and 1843 called for its adoption. In 1847, a motion was introduced in Parliament by Sir John Bowring calling for the introduction of a decimal currency and the striking of coins of one-tenth and one-hundredth of a pound. Bowring obtained surprisingly strong support for his motion, and the Russell government promised that a coin valued at one-tenth of a pound (two shillings) would be produced to test public opinion, with consideration in future to be given to the introduction of other decimal coins.|$|E

40|$|As <b>the</b> economies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Association <b>of</b> Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) {{have moved}} towards closer {{economic}} ties and trade integration in recent years, <b>the</b> establishment <b>of</b> exchange rate stability {{is becoming an}} important regional policy concern, particularly in <b>the</b> wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Asian <b>currency</b> crisis <b>of</b> 1997. This paper examines the exchange rate volatility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand between 1974 and 1999. Using variance decomposition (VDC) methods and impulse response functions, which are VAR-related estimation techniques, the study also investigates <b>the</b> regional <b>currency</b> linkages which {{may have played a}} role in transmitting exchange rate fluctuations. The results indicate that, in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adoption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crawling peg exchange regime following <b>the</b> breakup <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bretton Woods system, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five ASEAN <b>currencies</b> experienced volatility, with the Indonesian rupiah posting the highest volatility level. The switch to de facto pegging against the US dollar in the mid- 1980 s helped to stabilize all ASEAN <b>currencies</b> with <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Malaysian ringgit. Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five <b>currencies</b> became more susceptible to instabilities in other ASEAN <b>currencies</b> in <b>the</b> post- 1985 period.

5|$|The silver half dime, {{equal to}} five cents, had been issued since the 1790s. The American Civil War caused {{economic}} hardship, driving {{gold and silver}} from circulation; in response, in place of low-value coins, the government at first issued paper currency. In 1865, Congress abolished the five-cent fractional currency note after Spencer M. Clark, head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Currency</b> Bureau (today the Bureau of Engraving and Printing), placed his own portrait on the denomination. After the successful introduction of two-cent and three-cent pieces without precious metal, Congress also authorized a five-cent piece consisting of base metal; the Mint began striking this version in 1866.|$|E
5|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Transitional National Government in 2000, a group of businessmen imported about 30 billion shillings of Canadian-printed notes, sparking a collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> and wide-scale demonstrations and protests in Mogadishu. The value declined by 30 percent (to 13,000 per $1) in three months, {{and by the end of}} the 2001 the currency had fallen to about SoSh 22,000 per US dollar. Further imports of money caused additional disruption and the TNG was forced to buy up large amounts of money.|$|E
5|$|A state {{wishing to}} devalue, {{or at least}} check the {{appreciation}} of its currency, must work within {{the constraints of the}} prevailing International monetary system. During the 1930s, countries had relatively more direct control over their exchange rates through the actions of their central banks. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, markets substantially increased in influence, with market forces largely setting the exchange rates for an increasing number of countries. However, a state's central bank can still intervene in the markets to effect a devaluation – if it sells its own currency to buy other currencies then this will cause the value of its own currency to fall – a practice common with states that have a managed exchange rate regime. Less directly, quantitative easing (common in 2009 and 2010), tends to lead to a fall in the value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> even if the central bank does not directly buy any foreign assets.|$|E

5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{long-term}} effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films. The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases. To compensate for the devaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>currency,</b> some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars. Ticket prices have also risen at different rates of inflation around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.|$|E
5|$|Federation brought {{heightened}} tensions {{including a}} conflict with Indonesia as well continuous conflicts against the Communists in Borneo and the Malayan Peninsula which escalates to the Sarawak Communist Insurgency and Second Malayan Emergency together with several other {{issues such as the}} cross border attacks into North Borneo by Moro pirates from the southern islands of the Philippines, Singapore being expelled from the Federation in 1965, and racial strife. This strife culminated in the 13 May race riots in 1969. After the riots, the controversial New Economic Policy was launched by Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, trying to increase the share of the economy held by the bumiputera. Under Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad there was a period of rapid economic growth and urbanisation beginning in the 1980s. The economy shifted from being agriculturally based to one based on manufacturing and industry. Numerous mega-projects were completed, such as the Petronas Towers, the North–South Expressway, the Multimedia Super Corridor, and the new federal administrative capital of Putrajaya. However, in the late 1990s the Asian financial crisis almost caused the collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> and the stock and property markets.|$|E

5|$|Most {{taxes were}} due on {{each year on}} 1 September, and levied from {{individual}} landowners by decuriones (decurions). These decurions, analogous to city councilors, were responsible for paying from their own pocket what they failed to collect. Diocletian's reforms also {{increased the number of}} financial officials in the provinces: more rationales and magistri privatae are attested under Diocletian's reign than before. These officials represented the interests of the fisc, which collected taxes in gold, and the Imperial properties. Fluctuations in the value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> made collection of taxes in kind the norm, although these could be converted into coin. Rates shifted to take inflation into account. In 296, Diocletian issued an edict reforming census procedures. This edict introduced a general five-year census for the whole empire, replacing prior censuses that had operated at different speeds throughout the empire. The new censuses would keep up with changes in the values of capita and iuga.|$|E
5|$|The ECB targets {{interest}} rates rather than exchange rates {{and in general}} does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets. This {{is because of the}} implications of the Mundell–Fleming model, which implies a central bank cannot (without capital controls) maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously, because increasing the money supply results in a depreciation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>currency.</b> In the years following the Single European Act, the EU has liberalised its capital markets, and as the ECB has chosen monetary autonomy, the exchange-rate regime of the euro is flexible, or floating. The result of the ECB maintaining historically low {{interest rates}} and restricting money supply has been that over the last decade the euro has become expensive relative to the currency of Europe's main trading partners. However, in 2010, the euro started on a sharp decline. Starting at U.S$1.60 in 2008, and dropping to US$1.04 in 2015.In the following months € recovered till the value of 1.19 U.S.$.

5|$|The {{agricultural}} trade boom in Eastern Europe {{showed the}} first signs of the approaching crisis in the 1580s, when food prices stopped increasing. It was followed by a gradual decline in agricultural products prices, a price depression, initially present in Western Europe. The negative consequences of this process on folwark economies of the East had reached its culmination {{in the second half of}} the 17th century. Further economic aggravation resulted from Europe-wide devaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> around 1620, caused by the influx of silver from the Western Hemisphere. At that time however massive amounts of Polish grain were still exported through Danzig (Gdańsk). The Commonwealth nobility took a variety of steps to combat the crisis and keep up high production levels, burdening in particular the serfs with further heavy obligations. The nobles were also forcibly buying or taking over properties of the more affluent thus far peasant categories, a phenomenon especially pronounced from the mid 17th century.|$|E
