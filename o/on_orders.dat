5|$|After North-Beveland had {{surrendered}} on 18 May, Zeeuws-Vlaanderen was {{the last}} remaining unoccupied Dutch homeland territory. <b>On</b> <b>orders</b> of the French, all Dutch troops were withdrawn on 19 May to Ostend in Belgium, as their presence would be demoralising and confusing to their own forces. On 27 May all of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen had been occupied.|$|E
5|$|After the Nazis came {{to power}} in January 1933, Heiden was arrested. <b>On</b> <b>orders</b> from Himmler and his chief {{lieutenant}} Reinhard Heydrich, he was murdered later that year by members of the Sicherheitsdienst ("Security Service"; SD). Heiden's corpse was found in September 1933 and he was buried on 15 September 1933.|$|E

5|$|In 1273, Isa led raids against Ilkhanid-held Anbar {{in western}} Iraq <b>on</b> <b>orders</b> from Baybars, {{possibly}} to divert Ilkhanid forces from an expedition against Syria. The Mongols at Anbar retreated without resistance as Isa advanced. Months later, in March 1274, Isa's forces confronted {{a group of}} Khafaja Bedouin in Anbar, {{though there was no}} conclusive victory after a daylong battle. Isa commanded a contingent of Baybars' army in the 1277 campaign against the Mongols at the Battle of Elbistan. He visited Egypt later that year with Ahmad ibn Hajji, and the two were well received by Baybars.|$|E
5|$|In early 1861 the {{critical}} border state of Kentucky had declared neutrality in the American Civil War. This neutrality was first violated on September 3, when Confederate Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow, acting <b>on</b> <b>orders</b> from Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk, occupied Columbus, Kentucky. The riverside town was situated on 180 foot high bluffs that commanded {{the river at}} that point, where the Confederates installed 140 large guns, underwater mines and a heavy chain that stretched a mile across the Mississippi River to Belmont, while occupying the town with 17,000 Confederate troops, thus cutting off northern commerce {{to the south and}} beyond.|$|E
5|$|It {{has never}} been fully {{explained}} what motivated the attack: the gunmen {{claimed to have been}} acting on their own initiative, and despite abundant conspiracy theories, no convincing evidence surfaced to suggest that any political leader or party was behind the attack. Nevertheless, the killings left a leadership void in the political establishment. Conspiracy theories immediately flourished that the gunmen had been acting <b>on</b> <b>orders</b> to sabotage a Karabakh peace deal, but a decade on, the available evidence still pointed to the leading gunman being a loner with a grudge against the Armenian political elite.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Reed, who {{was trying}} to get home, was unable to get State Department {{clearance}} for a visa and was detained in Oslo (then called Christiana), Norway, for more than a month. His letters were censored, and Bryant did not hear from him directly until April. <b>On</b> <b>orders</b> from Edgar Sisson of the U.S. Commission on Public Information, all of Reed's papers were confiscated when he arrived in New York on April 28. Unable to write about the October Revolution without his notes, Reed instead gave speeches advocating U.S. recognition of the new Russian government. That summer, the couple retreated to Croton-on-Hudson.|$|E
5|$|The first Castellania of Valletta was {{demolished}} in the mid-18th century <b>on</b> <b>orders</b> of Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca, as he despised its austere {{architecture and}} wanted a symbolic building of his absolutism. There are claims based on {{word of mouth}} that in the 18th century the courts and tribunals were housed at 254, St. Paul's Street (now known as Europe House, and occupied by {{the offices of the}} European Commission and the European Parliament), plausibly between 1757 and 1760, however this is considered as a hearsay.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} {{recurring}} characters, all appearing in both realities. Captain Tricia Harper, Michael's commanding {{officer at the}} precinct, was a co-conspirator in Michael's car accident; however, it is hinted that her involvement was reluctant. Captain Carl Kessel (commanding officer at Hawkins' precinct) hid heroin in a storage unit for himself and Harper, and was behind Michael's car accident. For the crash the two used Ed Hawkins, <b>on</b> <b>orders</b> from Kessel.|$|E

5|$|According to Roberts, it {{is clear}} that the next phase of {{negotiations}} was intended to go beyond prisoner exchanges, as the prisoner of war negotiator Stilinović was not involved. Đilas and Velebit were passed through the German lines to Sarajevo and were then flown to Zagreb on 25 March in a military aircraft. These negotiations were with German representatives supervised by Ott, apparently on all the points discussed at Gornji Vakuf, and the Partisans made it clear to the Germans that their proposals did not amount to an offer of surrender. Velebit met personally with Glaise-Horstenau, as the Austrian had known Velebit's father, a Yugoslav general. After this first visit to Zagreb, Velebit visited Partisan commanders in Slavonia and eastern Bosnia passing <b>on</b> <b>orders</b> for the suspension of attacks on the Germans and their rail communications, and the release of prisoners.|$|E
5|$|After his recovery, d'Hautpoul {{was given}} {{command of the}} heavy cavalry of the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse under General Paul Grenier. After Neuwied, he was {{transferred}} to the Army of England under command of Lazare Hoche. When the French Directory abandoned the idea of an invasion of England, he was again deployed on the German front, this time as part of the Army of the Danube. After the French loss at the Battle of Ostrach, his Cavalry reserve protected the French retreat from Pfullendorf. A few days later, after failing to lead a timely charge at the Battle of Stockach, he was suspended <b>on</b> <b>orders</b> of the Army commander, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, who blamed d'Hautpoul for the defeat. Acquitted by a court-martial in Strasbourg, d'Hautpoul resumed his duties at the end of July 1799, having missed the critical actions at the First Battle of Zurich.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War, remnants of the United States Asiatic Fleet fled to Australia, <b>on</b> <b>orders</b> from Washington. The S-boats from the Philippines were organized into a fighting force at Brisbane, and Admiral Ernest King ordered S-boats from the Atlantic Fleet to supplement the force in Australia. Christie went along, arriving in April 1942, {{just in time for the}} Battle of the Coral Sea. During the Solomon Islands campaign, he ordered his boats to patrol around harbors which, while being key points for shipping, also tended to be heavily patrolled by aircraft and anti-submarine craft. In step with then-current U.S. Navy submarine doctrine, he made capital ships the prime targets, rather than have his boats focus on merchant shipping.|$|E

5|$|Author Charles Higham {{claimed that}} Anthony Blunt, an MI5 agent and Soviet spy, acting <b>on</b> <b>orders</b> from the British royal family, made a {{successful}} secret trip to Schloss Friedrichshof in Germany {{towards the end}} of the war to retrieve sensitive letters between the Duke of Windsor and Adolf Hitler and other leading Nazis. What is certain is that George VI sent the Royal Librarian, Owen Morshead, accompanied by Blunt, then working part-time in the Royal Library as well as for British intelligence, to Friedrichshof in March 1945 to secure papers relating to the German Empress Victoria, the eldest child of Queen Victoria. Looters had stolen part of the castle's archive, including surviving letters between daughter and mother, as well as other valuables, some of which were recovered in Chicago after the war. The papers rescued by Morshead and Blunt, and those returned by the American authorities from Chicago, were deposited in the Royal Archives.|$|E
5|$|Eventually accumulating all the artifacts, the Raiders {{discover}} that the Moebius Foundation is a front for the heir apparent of the Dominion, Valerian Mengsk; though the Hyperion crew is concerned about having been working for their enemy, Valerian coaxes Raynor to accompany him in invading Char as the combined artifact may reverse Kerrigan's infestation. Although the Dominion takes heavy losses to the Zerg, the Raiders defend the artifact from Kerrigan until it can be activated; upon detonating, it destroys all nearby Zerg and leaves Kerrigan human again. However, Findlay, acting <b>on</b> <b>orders</b> from Arcturus Mengsk, attempts to kill the weakened Kerrigan, forcing Raynor to kill Findlay before tending to Kerrigan.|$|E
5|$|Full-time National Serviceman Muhammad Fadil Abdul Hamid was {{detained}} on 4 April 2010. He {{was described by}} the media as self-radicalized, having been deeply influenced by the lectures of Feiz Mohammad and Anwar al-Aulaqi which he had accessed online. Around this time, two other people influenced by al-Aulaqi were placed under restriction orders. Between January and July 2011, three Muslim radicals were deported to Singapore from other countries and detained. JI members Jumari bin Kamdi and Samad bin Subari were arrested in Malaysia and Indonesia respectively; while Abdul Majid s/o Kunji Mohammad, {{a member of the}} Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), was arrested in Malaysia. As of 13 September 2011, there were 17 people <b>on</b> <b>orders</b> of detention, one whose detention had been suspended, and 49 people on restriction orders. On 7 March 2013, it was mentioned in Parliament that 64 people had been detained under the ISA for activities related to terrorism since 2002.|$|E

5|$|Home Army {{relations}} with the Soviet Red Army became increasingly poor {{over the course of}} the war. Not only had the Soviet Union invaded Poland on 17 September 1939, following the German invasion beginning 1 September 1939, but even after the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 the latter saw Polish partisans loyal to the Polish Government in Exile more as a potential obstacle to Soviet plans to take control of postwar Poland, than as a potential ally. <b>On</b> <b>orders</b> from the Soviet Stavka (high command), issued on 22 June 1943, Soviet partisans engaged Polish partisans in combat, and it has been claimed that they attacked the Poles more often than they did the Germans.|$|E
5|$|In January 1953, {{the corps}} {{underwent}} its last major {{reorganization of the}} war, losing command of the US 3rd, 24th, and 45th Infantry Divisions, the South Korean 8th and 9th Infantry Divisions, and the British 1st Commonwealth Division, while taking command of the US 2nd, 7th, and 25th Infantry Divisions and the 1st Marine Division. On 23 January 1953, the first major action {{of the year was}} initiated with a raid by aggressive infantrymen of the South Korean 1st Infantry Division against the enemy's Big Nori positions. The next months saw many such raids which harassed the enemy, captured prisoners, and destroyed defensive works. Beginning in March, the Communists continually attacked the corps outposts. In that month, troops on Old Baldy were withdrawn, <b>on</b> <b>orders</b> from I Corps, after suffering heavy casualties from the Chinese. On 10 April 1953 Lieutenant General Bruce C. Clarke, who was to see the corps through the remainder of its combat, assumed command.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, Walt's partner Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) has just shot Gale to death <b>on</b> <b>orders</b> from Walt to foil Gus' plot {{to kill and}} replace them. Gus' henchman Victor (Jeremiah Bitsui) arrives at Gale's {{apartment}} and finds him dead, surrounded by neighbors who have just called the police. Victor finds a stunned Jesse sitting in his car outside and forces him at gunpoint {{to return to the}} meth lab, where Gus' employee Mike (Jonathan Banks) is holding Walt hostage. Mike, who is concerned that Victor was seen by bystanders at the murder scene, calls to inform Gus of the events. Victor, who has often watched Walt work, starts cooking meth himself to prove they do not need him or Jesse. Walt grows concerned when Victor proves better at the process than he expected.|$|E
