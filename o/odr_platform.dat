5000|$|As an {{alternative}} to private, professional settlement, the concept of crowdjustice has recently taken shape {{as a means to}} leverage social norms and the wisdom of crowds to determine the outcome of a dispute. This concept forms the basis for the <b>ODR</b> <b>platform</b> Ujuj. Ujuj (pronounced [...] "you judge") is a patent pending online alternative to small claims court that allows parties to a small claims case to create their arguments on video and upload them to the Ujuj web site for the Internet public to vote on the outcome. Parties to a case, known as Claimant and Respondent, agree, through an electronically signed contract, to be bound by the final outcome determined by a jury consisting of the Internet public. Registered users select from all open cases, view the video arguments of the Claimant and Respondent, and then cast their vote on a sliding scale from 0% to 100%, which represents the amount that the user feels should be awarded based on the amount claimed by the Claimant. This vote is added to all other votes on the case and upon case expiration, an average vote is calculated from all votes received. This average is then multiplied by the amount claimed to determine the final award.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the new legal framework on consumer Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in the EU. Its primary {{contribution lies in}} identifying that harmonising the complaint submission in a pan-European Online Dispute Resolution (<b>ODR)</b> <b>platform,</b> and directing parties to nationally approved ADR entities that comply with minimum standards, will not fulfil the potential of an extra-judicial consumer redress system. This paper proposes key functions that the <b>ODR</b> <b>platform</b> should incorporate {{if it is to}} provide effective redress. This paper also argues that a successful <b>ODR</b> <b>platform</b> should include built-in incentives that encourage parties to: (i) participate in approved ADR processes; (ii) settle complaints with little or no intervention from neutral third parties; and (iii) ensure voluntary compliance with final outcomes.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the ‘rule of law’ and ‘justice’ implications of using Online Dispute Resolution (<b>ODR)</b> <b>platforms</b> as technology-mediated interfaces for small claim dispute resolution in construction projects. Data is {{obtained from a}} questionnaire survey of construction stakeholders, administered using direct non-random sampling of professional contacts with the authors. Surprisingly, study findings do not suggest any ‘rule of law’ and ‘justice’ implications for small claim ODR. Tentatively, this conclusion supports wider use of ODR. The originality {{of the study is}} that although there is considerable academic and practitioner interest in various alternative forms of dispute resolution (ADR), both practitioner use and academic study of ODR remain sparse. Thus, this study serves as a foundation for further empirical exploration of ODR as a nascent component of ADR...|$|R
40|$|The growing use of Information Technology in the {{commercial}} arena leads to an urgent need to find alternatives to traditional dispute resolution. New tools from fields such as artificial intelligence (AI) {{should be considered in}} the process of developing novel online dispute resolution (<b>ODR)</b> <b>platforms,</b> in order to make the ligation process simpler, faster and conform with the new virtual environments. In this work, we describe UMCourt, a project built around two sub-fields of AI research:Multi-agent Systems and Case-Based Reasoning, aimed at fostering the development of tools for ODR. This is then used to accomplish several objectives, from suggesting solutions to new disputes based on the observation of past similar disputes, to the improvement of the negotiation and mediation processes that may follow. The main objective of this work is to develop autonomous tools that can increase the effectiveness of the dispute resolution processes, namely by increasing the amount of meaningful information that is available for the parties...|$|R
40|$|Often, {{the overall}} success of an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process {{hinges on the}} ability of a neutral third party to {{establish}} a level playing field supported by a sense of equal bargaining power between disputants. Most forms of ADR, including traditional approaches to mediation and arbitration, are characterized by in-person interactions, where disputants and third parties communicate through a combination of verbal and nonverbal cues. Though many believe that this form of interaction is crucial for effective communication, it may result in significant disadvantages for autistic parties who face difficulties properly discerning the intentions or meaning of these cues. This work examines the potential benefits of implementing Online Dispute Resolution (<b>ODR)</b> tools and <b>platforms</b> in dispute resolution processes involving autistic parties. It explores the inherent disadvantages presented by traditional forms of ADR and proposes an alternative approach geared toward the individual needs of parties and the accommodation of cognitive difference. Given the high potential for eased communication presented by computer and internet technologies for autistic disputants, this work posits that an ideal process would be one that effectively incorporates ODR tools and that provides a structured and stable environment for dispute resolution...|$|R
40|$|Only 18 % of {{consumers}} in the European Union have used the Internet to purchase a product abroad in 2014. The main reason {{is that they do}} not feel confident in online shopping. One of the key factors is lack of dispute resolution mechanisms which would be efficient and which would offer consumers proper mechanisms to deal with their dispute online in a fast way. The European Commission understood the potential of Online Dispute Resolution (ODR)) which is able to offer consumers an efficient solution to solve their dispute and it is trying to foster cross-border e-commerce by adopting the Regulation on Online Dispute Resolution for Consumer Disputes (which establishes <b>ODR</b> <b>platform)</b> and the Directive on Alternative Dispute Resolution for Consumer Disputes. The main aim of the article is to present aspects arising from using an <b>ODR</b> <b>platform,</b> which builds on a previous theoretical work of the author. The purpose of the article is to analyse impacts which arise from such dispute resolution and to discuss particular phases connected with the utilization of the <b>ODR</b> <b>platform.</b> The <b>ODR</b> <b>platform</b> should be fully operational and accessible to consumers from 15 th February 2016...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{judicial}} mechanisms did {{not offer}} an adequate solution for cross-border electronic commerce disputes. Although there has been expected great potential in solving disputes online {{and the rise of}} Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) use, the assumptions has not been confirmed yet. Only a few examples demonstrate the success stories of ODR, which is in big contrast to the continuous growth of electronic transactions and in general {{with the use of the}} online environment. The European Commission however understood the potential of ODR and it is trying to foster the use of it by adopting the ODR Regulation and the ADR Directive. Such legal framework has been developed to apply in consumer disputes arising out of sales or providing services between an EU consumer and an EU trader. The ADR Directive sets out basic standards of ADR entities and processual rules under which it is possible to solve the dispute. Then under the ODR Regulation the complainant will be able to submit a complaint using the <b>ODR</b> <b>platform.</b> The complaint (and any related documentation) will be submitted to the <b>ODR</b> <b>platform</b> via an electronic form. Yet it is necessary to assess the risks of above mentioned legal framework. One of the great concerns are connected with possible forum shopping while providers are registering as ADR entities. Experienced trader (unlike the consumer) is able to choose ADR provider, which is more likely to decide in his favour. Possible exclusion of online negotiation or even online tools in general is then further underlining possible concerns. The paper will thus assess main legal aspects of ADR / ODR legal framework of European Union Law and it will deal with main problematic parts of it...|$|E
40|$|This {{chapter is}} {{structured}} as follows. In Section B we explore the legal {{basis for the}} creation of European civil procedures and Europeanization of procedural private law in general. In Section C we provide an overview of existing EU instruments on civil procedure, which we propose to divide into three groups: optional instruments, horizontal instruments, and sector-specific instruments, enacted on the legal basis of Article 114 TFEU but nevertheless catching civil procedure within their scope. In Section D we focus on the recently amended European Small Claims Procedure and we draw attention to the missed opportunity of creating more synergy between the ESCP and ADR/ODR regulatory framework. We argue that the European <b>ODR</b> <b>platform</b> can be instrumental in raising awareness about the ESCP and that national courts employing the ESCP should encourage parties to consider more cost-effective ADR processes. Section E concludes...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss if {{and to what extent}} the 2013 EU Regulation on {{consumer}} online dispute resolution (ODR) in tandem with the EU Directive on consumer alternative dispute resolution (ADR) is likely to finally fulfil the expectations of ODR that policy makers and academics have had for many years. Part 1 examines the reasons why ODR has not yet taken off. Part 2 discusses previous EU initiatives that aimed to promote the use of ADR and ODR. Part 3 briefly examines the Directive on consumer ADR and the Regulation on consumer ODR, and it compares the EU approach with the UNCITRAL draft rules on ODR. Finally, Part 4 evaluates the obstacles faced in the implementation of the EU <b>ODR</b> <b>Platform,</b> and calls for the embedding of incentives in its operation, the provision of an online negotiation tool, a connection to small claims processes, and the incorporation of adequate tools to overcome language barriers.

40|$|Since {{the seminal}} work by Perelman, Olbrechts-Tyteca, Toulmin, Ong, Giuliani and many others in late fifties and sixties, {{dialogue}} and argumentation have increasingly {{been at the center}} of philosophical discussions. Modelization of arguments and “argumentation schemes” constitute one of the main domains within the AI & Law field. The construction of Legal Electronic Institutions (LEI), and Ontomedia, an Online Dispute Resolution (<b>ODR)</b> <b>platform</b> in the context of the research carried out within the Catalan White Book on Mediation, has enhanced the discussion about fundamental issues on the theoretical approach taken in building such Web 2. 0 and Web 3. 0 tools. In this paper, I will address the question of how the content of ancient stasis, ekphrasis and inventio may be captured and reelaborated to define their theoretical backbones. I will call “relational justice” the conceptual legal framework in which Semantic Web strategies can be nested to offer a better user-centered service...|$|E
