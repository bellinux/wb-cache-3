40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the {{qualitative and quantitative}} differences on dental plaque formation on two different roughness titanium implant surfaces, i. e. machined and titanium plasma sprayed, {{as well as the}} amount of plaque removal by regular toothbrushing after 72 -hour plaque accumulation. Methods: Eight systemically healthy subjects were recruited from the patient pool of a private dental practice. All patients underwent <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> instruction and full mouth prophylaxis. Subsequently, maxillary casts from all patients were obtained and removable 0. 7 mm-thick acetate stents without occlusal contact points were fabricated to support four titanium specimens of 4 x 2 x 2 mm divided into two groups (machined and plasma sprayed). Subjects were instructed to wear the stents for 72 hours, full time, removing them only during regular <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene.</b> Subsequently, the <b>appliances</b> were immediately repositioned and then the test side was brushed for 20 seconds. At the end of the 72 -hour period, the stents were removed and prepared for microbiological analysis. Results: Both machined and plasma sprayed brushed surfaces presented statistically significant fewer bacteria than non-brushed surfaces. Similarly, regarding surface roughness, machined surfaces presented a total number of bacteria significantly smaller than those presented by plasma sprayed surfaces (P< 0. 05). Statistically, the non-brushed machined turned surfaces presented a greater amount of Streptoccocus sp. when compared to the brushed machined surfaces. It was concluded that rough surfaces accumulated more dental plaque than polished surfaces. Both brushed surfaces presented less plaque accumulation, however, implant brushing was more effective on machined surfaces. (Am J Dent 2008; 21 : 318 - 322) ...|$|R

Materials and Methods: A total of 900 children, 12 years old and their mothers were selected by random sampling from 10 administrative wards of Mathura city. The general information and data regarding mothers′ <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> knowledge and practice were obtained by personal interview using a pretested questionnaire. Clinical examination of the subjects was done using <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> index-simplified (OHI-S) for both children and mothers. The data obtained were analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), version 11. 5 for windows. One-way ANOVA and independent t-test were used to find out the impact of mothers′ <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> knowledge and practice on <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> status of their 12 -year-old children. Results: Mothers′ <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> knowledge was found to {{have a significant impact on}} <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> status of their 12 -year-old children.

The fourth hypothesis that nurses do not ask patients to tell them what their <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> habits are was true. I conducted the research by the questionnaire method and the method of a stuctured interview. The research samples were nurses and patients in following units - neurological, internal, surgical and orthopaedic - in the České Budějovice hospital, Inc. and in the Tábor hospital. Inc. The results of this research could be used as a feedback for hospital management to help improve patients´oral hygiene. It is necessary to take some measures in this respect. Nurses should be more active in getting information about patients´ <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> aids and their hygienic habits. They should ensure the highest patients´comfort possible. Then their efforts will be rewarding...|$|R

A total of 128 subjects were given the Beery test of visual motor integration to determine their developmental age. A pre- and post-brushing plaque score was obtained as a measure of each subject's <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> ability. Statistical analysis of the data revealed that chronological age was not a statistically significant predictor of <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> ability, while developmental age as determined by the Beery test was found to be a statistically significant predictor of <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> ability (p <. 006) ...|$|R

40|$|Generalized {{periodontitis}} is {{the most}} common form of periodontal pathology, especially in the second half of life. Nowadays, the problem of periodontal disease is relevant due to its high prevalence, tendency to progression, multifaceted influence on the dentoalveolar system and the whole organism as well as uncertain treatment. Therefore, there is a need to find optimal ways of prevention and treatment of this disease. Close relationships between periodontal pathology and systemic diseases, such as hypertension, which affects every 2 nd- 3 rd adult were determined. The objective of the research was to determine the status of <b>oral</b> cavity <b>hygiene</b> in patients with generalized periodontitis of II degree and stage II hypertension. Materials and methods.  The study included 30 patients with generalized periodontitis of II degree and stage II hypertension being treated in the Ivano-Frankivsk Regional Clinical Cardiology Dispensary; the average age ranged from 35 to 54 years (the main group). The control group included 10 patients of the same age without generalized periodontitis and somatic pathology. The status of <b>oral</b> cavity <b>hygiene</b> was determined using the Green Vermillion index. The diagnosis of periodontal disease was made on the basis of the classification proposed by M. F. Danilevskyi. The obtained results were subjected to variation-statistical analysis using statistical package “Stat Soft 6. 0 ”; classical methods of variational statistics were applied; mean values and their reliability were evaluated. Results.  The results of examination showed poor <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> in almost all patients. The analysis of hygienic indices showed the following results: in patients of the main group, the Green Vermillion index was 1. 99 ± 0. 13 points (p< 0. 001) which corresponds to unsatisfactory level of <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene.</b> In patients of the control group, this index was 1. 10 ± 0. 17 points which corresponds to satisfactory level of <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene.</b> According to the index, 9 (30. 0 %) patients of the main group had satisfactory <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene,</b> 12 (40. 0 %) patients had poor <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene,</b> and in 9 (30. 0 %) patients, poor <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> was observed. In the control group, 2 (20. 0 %) patients had good <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene,</b> 6 (60. 0 %) patients had satisfactory <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> and in 2 (20. 0 %) patients, unsatisfactory <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> was observed. There were no patients with poor <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene.</b> The analysis of the indicators of the Green Vermillion index showed that in case of the pathological process exacerbation the <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> status in patients deteriorated. Conclusions.  The level of <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> in patients of both groups was low due to incorrect selection of personal hygiene products or their untimely replacement. In patients with generalized periodontitis of II degree and stage II hypertension, the level of <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> was lower than in somatically healthy persons: the worse status of <b>oral</b> cavity <b>hygiene</b> – the more pronounced changes in the periodontal tissues. We can suppose that high blood pressure affects the status of the oral cavity, creates a higher risk and exacerbates the periodontal diseases...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To make {{practical}} {{recommendations for}} improving <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> behavior (OHB) potential predictors {{based on the}} Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) were assessed. Measurements of oral health knowledge (OHK) and the expected social effect for having healthy teeth were included. Methods: 216 recruits in the Dutch Army ground forces completed a questionnaire about <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> behavior, attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioral control (PBC), intention to perform optimal OH B. OH K. and expected social outcomes. Results: The multivariate regression analysis revealed that attitude and PBC explained 37. 2 % {{of the variance in}} intention to perform optimal <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> behavior, which is a substantial proportion. Furthermore, actual <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> behavior was only predicted by attitude, explaining 7. 1 % of the variance. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that recruits' <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> behavior may be improved by promoting a more positive attitude and especially by enhancing perceived behavior control...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} impact of socio-demographic and {{clinical}} variables on the <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> and periodontal status in a sample of mentally disabled subjects. Materials and Methods: Study sample comprised of 171 mentally disabled subjects attending a special school in Udaipur, India. <b>Oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> status was assessed by Simplified <b>Oral</b> <b>Hygiene</b> Index (OHI-S) and periodontal status by Community Periodontal Index. Results: Stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that the best predictors in the descending order for <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> index were disabled sibling, medical diagnosis, IQ level, education of mother and father. Having Down syndrome, less educated parents, poor economic status and a disabled sibling were the most important predictors for poor periodontal status. Conclusions: The present study highlighted that the <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> and periodontal status of the present study population is poor and was influenced by medical diagnosis, IQ level, disabled sibling, parent&#x 2032;s level of education and economic status...|$|R
