30|$|Nanofluids, i.e., {{colloidal}} suspensions {{of solid}} nanoparticles, and more recently, nanoemulsion fluids have {{attracted much attention}} because of their potential to surpass the performance of conventional heat transfer fluids [1 – 22]. The coolants, lubricants, oils, and <b>other</b> <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluids</b> used in today's thermal systems typically have inherently poor heat transfer properties which {{have come to be}} reckoned as the most limiting technical challenges faced by a multitude of diverse industry and military groups. A number of studies have been conducted to investigate thermal properties of nanofluids with various nanoparticles and base fluids. However, the scientific community has not yet come to an agreement on the fundamental effects of nanoparticles on thermal conductivity of the base fluids. For example, many groups have reported strong thermal conductivity enhancement beyond that predicted by Maxwell's model in nanofluids [1, 2, 23, 24]. Consequently, several hypotheses were proposed to explain those unexpected experimental results, including particle Brownian motion, particle clustering, ordered liquid layer, and dual-phase lagging [18, 21, 25 – 28]. Recently, however, an International Nanofluid Property Benchmark Exercise reported that no such anomalous enhancement was observed in nanofluids [22].|$|E

40|$|Solar thermal-to-electric {{power plants}} have been tested and {{investigated}} at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) since the late 1970 s, and thermal storage {{has always been an}} area of key study because it affords an economical method of delivering solar-electricity during non-daylight hours. This paper describes the design considerations of a new, single-tank, thermal storage system and details the benefits of employing this technology in large-scale (10 MW to 100 MW) solar thermal power plants. Since December 1999, solar engineers at Sandia National Laboratories' National Solar Thermal Test Facility (NSTTF) have designed and are constructing a thermal storage test called the thermocline system. This technology, which employs a single thermocline tank, has the potential to replace the traditional and more expensive two-tank storage systems. The thermocline tank approach uses a mixture of silica sand and quartzite rock to displace {{a significant portion of the}} volume in the tank. Then it is filled with the heat transfer fluid, a molten nitrate salt. A thermal gradient separates the hot and cold salt. Loading the tank with the combination of sand, rock, and molten salt instead of just molten salt dramatically reduces the system cost. The typical cost of the molten nitrate salt is $ 800 per ton versus the cost of the sand and rock portion at $ 70 per ton. Construction of the thermocline system will be completed in August 2000, and testing will run for two to three months. The testing results will be used to determine the economic viability of the single-tank (thermocline) storage technology for large-scale solar thermal power plants. Also discussed in this paper are the safety issues involving molten nitrate salts and <b>other</b> <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluids,</b> such as synthetic heat transfer oils, and the impact of these issues on the system design...|$|E
40|$|Phase change {{materials}} (PCM) {{possess a}} great capacity of accumulation {{of energy in}} their temperature of fusion thanks to the latent heat. These materials are used in applications where {{it is necessary to}} store energy due to the temporary phase shift between the offer and demand of thermal energy. Thus, possible applications are the solar systems as well as the recovery of residual heat for its posterior use in other processes. In spite of this great potential, the practical feasibility of latent heat storage with PCM is still limited, mainly due to a rather low thermal conductivity. This low conductivity implies small <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> coefficients and, consequently, thermal cycles are slow and not suitable for most of the potential applications. This work investigates experimentally the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> process during melting (charge) and solidification (discharge) of five small heat exchangers working as latent heat thermal storage systems. Commercial paraffin RT 35 is used as PCM filling one side of the heat exchanger and water circulates through the <b>other</b> side as <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>fluid.</b> Average thermal power values are evaluated for various operating conditions and compared among the heat exchangers studied. When the comparison is done for average power per unit area and per average temperature gradient, results show that the double pipe heat exchanger with the PCM embedded in a graphite matrix (DPHX-PCM matrix) is the one with higher values, in the range of 700 - 800 Â W/m 2 -K, which are one order of magnitude higher than the ones presented by the second best.
