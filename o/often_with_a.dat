5|$|A key {{ingredient}} to the Hammond organ's success {{was the use}} of dealerships and a sense of community. Several dedicated organ dealers set up business in the United States and there was a bi-monthly newsletter, The Hammond Times, mailed out to subscribers. Advertisements tended to show families gathered around the instrument, <b>often</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> child playing it, as an attempt to show the organ as a center-point of home life and to encourage children to learn music.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-sixteenth {{century the}} Reformation revolutionised church {{architecture}} in Scotland. It {{resulted in a}} rejection of the elaborate ornamentation of existing churches. New churches were produced in a plain style, <b>often</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> T-plan that emphasised the pulpit and preaching. This style was adopted by both Presbyterian and Episcopalian wings of the Scottish Kirk, but there were some attempts to introduce Baroque elements into church building after the Restoration. In the eighteenth century the influence of James Gibbs led to churches that employed classical elements, with a pedimented rectangular plan and <b>often</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> steeple. This classicism continued into the early nineteenth century, but became increasingly controversial and began to be rejected for a version of the Gothic revival, which flourished into the early twentieth century. Between the world wars, a form of neo-Romanesque became the norm for new churches. In {{the second half of the}} twentieth century new churches were highly influenced by modernism, resulting in rectangular and irregularly shaped buildings, built in new materials, although many of these were later demolished. As the level of new building reduced from the 1970s there was a move to functional and unambitious new churches, but in the 1980s there was a move back to more striking and original designs.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} Camillan system of {{organisation}} of the 3rd and 4th centuries BC, men were sorted into classes based on wealth, the principes being the wealthiest after the triarii. Principes were armed with short spears, or hastae, up to 1.8metres (6ft) long. They fought in a quincunx formation, usually carrying scuta, large rectangular shields, and bronze helmets, <b>often</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> number of feathers fixed {{onto the top}} to increase stature. They wore heavier armour types, {{the most common form}} being chainmail, which offered a good degree of protection without hindering movement.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{explored}} {{the theme of}} escapism at the Indianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art in a show entitled The Production of Escapism: A Solo Project by Rashid Johnson. He addressed distraction and relief from reality through art and fantasy. Johnson used photos, video and site-specific installation to study escapist tendencies through <b>often</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sense of humor that bordered on the absurd.|$|E
5|$|Many metals are geologically most {{abundant}} as ionic compounds within ores. To obtain the elemental materials, these ores are processed by smelting or electrolysis, in which redox reactions occur (<b>often</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> reducing agent such as carbon) {{such that the}} metal ions gain electrons to become neutral atoms.|$|E

5|$|Maya {{households}} interred {{their dead}} underneath the floors of their houses, with offerings {{appropriate to the}} social status of the family. There the dead could act as protective ancestors. Maya lineages were patrilineal, so the worship of a prominent male ancestor would be emphasized, <b>often</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> household shrine. As Maya society developed, and the elite became more powerful, Maya royalty developed their household shrines into the great pyramids that held the tombs of their ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{literature}} {{focuses on}} the dining habits of the upper classes, for whom the evening meal (cena) had important social functions. Guests were entertained in a finely decorated dining room (triclinium), <b>often</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> view of the peristyle garden. Diners lounged on couches, leaning on the left elbow. By the late Republic, if not earlier, women dined, reclined, and drank wine along with men.|$|E
5|$|The {{machines}} were not all straight {{copies of the}} ZX81; some, such as the CP-200, came with extra memory and a larger case (<b>often</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> chiclet keyboard {{in place of the}} original membrane keyboard). One clone, the TL801 from TELLAB of Italy, could emulate either the ZX80 or ZX81 and switch between the two machines via a jumper.|$|E

5|$|They fought as hoplites, usually {{carrying}} clipei, large round Greek shields, {{and wearing}} bronze helmets, <b>often</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> number of feathers fixed {{onto the top}} to increase stature. Heavy plate armour was favoured, with mail also being popular. Many would paint or engrave portraits of ancestors onto their shield, believing that it would bring them luck in battle.|$|E

5|$|After the Restoration in 1660, {{there was}} a fashion for grand private houses in designs {{influenced}} by the Palladian style and associated with the architects Sir William Bruce (1630–1710) and James Smith (c. 1645–1731). After the Act of Union in 1707, the threat of Jacobite Rebellions led to the building of military defences such as Fort George near Inverness. Scotland produced {{some of the most}} significant architects of the eighteenth century, including Colen Campbell, James Gibbs and William Adam, who all had a major influence on Georgian architecture across Britain. The influence of Gibbs led to churches that employed classical elements, with a pedimented rectangular plan and <b>often</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> steeple.|$|E
5|$|The Burys {{travelled}} {{north as}} second-class {{passengers on the}} steamer Cambria. They arrived at Dundee {{on the evening of}} 20 January 1889, and the following morning they rented a room above a bar at 43 Union Street. The Burys stayed for only eight days before they moved on 29 January to a squat at 113 Prince's Street, a basement flat under a shop. William had obtained the key under false pretences by telling the letting agents that he was a viewer interested in renting the property. Meanwhile, Ellen found a job as a cleaner at a local mill, but she quit after a day. William continued to drink heavily, <b>often</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> decorator called David Walker, who was re-painting the public house frequented by William.|$|E
5|$|The Collegian {{has been}} the school student {{newspaper}} of record at Baltimore City College since it was first published as a bi-weekly newspaper in 1929. There have been other similar publications, such as The Oriole, the student magazine which started printing in 1912, however The Collegian is oldest, continuous student-run publication. Originally, the newspaper was both managed and printed by students. During the 1930s, The Collegian won numerous awards including {{second place in the}} Columbia Scholastic Press Association's annual contest for five years in a row. Since 2000, printing of the publication has been scaled back. The Collegian is now published quarterly, <b>often</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bonus issue {{around the time of the}} annual City-Poly football game. Since 2014, The Collegian also actively engages students and alumni through various social media platforms.|$|E

5|$|The capillitium {{refers to}} coarse, late-maturing, {{thick-walled}} {{cells in the}} gleba that develop pores or slits in their thick secondary walls. The capillitial hyphae are 1.5–9.5µm wide, thick-walled, <b>often</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> narrow lumen, and with or without surface ornamentation. The columella hyphae are 1.5–14µm wide (occasionally wider, up to 34µm), thick-walled, often with narrow lumen. Single thin-walled, about 1.5µm wide hyphae with clamps can be observed. The endoperidial hyphae are densely interwoven, thick-walled, and about 2–6µm wide. The whitish powder on newly expanded specimens consists of crystalline matter and thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, branched hyphae with clamps. The peristome hyphae are thick-walled, 2–11µm wide. The pseudoparenchymatous layer is built up by bladder-like, thin-walled hyphae of varying size. On the surface of newly expanded specimens crystals and thin-walled hyphae {{of the same kind}} as on the endoperidium are present. The crystals are calcium oxalate dihydrate that have the crystalline structure of a pyramid, and are arranged singly or in loose aggregates, 11 to 30µm in size. The fibrous layer has thick-walled hyphae 1.5–4µm wide. The mycelial layer in the inner, very thin part (seen as a glossy lining on the fibrous layer of newly expanded fruit bodies) consists of a dense web of thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, clamped hyphae. Thick-walled hyphae are also present, measuring 2–11 (sometimes up to 19)µm wide. The outer part (the mycelial cup) consists of thick-walled, branched and densely interwoven hyphae (<b>often</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> narrow lumen) that measure 1.5–4µm wide.|$|E
5|$|The {{centre of}} {{attention}} is {{in large part}} on the characters, described <b>often</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> personal slant and using memorable expressions ("It is we who are Hamlet") and incorporating psychological insights that were to become highly influential in later criticism. Though at first less influential, Hazlitt's comments on the plays' dramatic structure and poetry and on the central themes and general mood of each play laid the groundwork for later critics' more elaborate interpretations. Frequently expressing the view that stage presentation could not do justice to Shakespeare's plays, Hazlitt nevertheless also found certain plays eminently actable, and he frequently admired the performances of certain actors, particularly Edmund Kean.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{altitude}} {{site where}} D.regia is found is characterised by permanently damp soils consisting mostly of a gravel bench formed from a creek bed. The plants grow in a peaty quartzite sand, <b>often</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gravel cover. Rhizomes of mature plants grow above ground and among associated grasses and sedges when gravel is absent and below ground {{when there is}} a gravel cover present. Associated vegetation included species of Leucadendron and members of the families Cyperaceae, Iridaceae, and Restionaceae. The habitat of D.regia depends on periodic fire sweeping through and keeping the larger plants from choking out D.regia. Frost occurs infrequently in the valley.|$|E
