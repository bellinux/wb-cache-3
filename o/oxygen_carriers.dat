Kinetics is {{the study}} of rates of {{chemical}} processes, which includes investigations of how different experimental conditions can influence the speed of a chemical reaction and the reaction’s mechanism. In this paper, the influences of several parameters including particle size and mass of copper-based <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier,</b> reaction gas flow rate and temperature on the conversion rate of <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> in chemical looping combustion was investigated. The results of experiment reveal that the conversion rate of <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> is influenced by the reaction temperature, mass of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> and the reaction gas flow rate. The conversion rate of <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> is improved with decreasing the mass of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> and increasing the reaction gas flow rate within a certain extent in the chemical looping combustion process.

40|$|International audienceThe {{process of}} Chemical Looping Combustion necessitates {{the use of}} two reactors. In the first one, called “fuelreactor”, the {{reaction}} of combustion of methane with an <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> takes place (reduction step of the oxygencarrier), then, the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> is re-oxidised with air in the second reactor called “oxidation reactor” (oxidation step). Diminution of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> performances after some cycles of reduction and oxidation are observed. The main objective {{of this study is}} to understand the phenomena leading to a decrease of the process performances. For this purpose, some experiments and modelling of fixed bed reactor have been performed to determine the relation between <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> structure changes (variation of porosity, chemical composition, structural organisation,…) and process performances decrease (variation of methane conversion and <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> regeneration rate, …). In order to qualify the variation of physical properties of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> material, analysis like X-ray diffraction, BET surface measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, are done to bring out the variation of structure of <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> particles. The model of the used fixed bed is modified to take into account all the phenomena observed. Several points will be presented concerning the degradation of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> particles:- even in case of fixed bed reactor (avoiding high friction between particles), the shape of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> grains mayvaries after several cycles of oxidation/reduction of the material. BET analysis will be done to quantify the impact of thosemodifications on the reacting surface of each grain,- X-ray diffraction analyses will show the evolution of the proportion of NiO, Ni and NiAl 2 O 4 in the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> grains. Theanalysis of the X-ray signals should indicate that there are some structural modifications of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier.</b> - after the reoxidation of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier,</b> the grains are stuck to each other and form aggregates, measurements will bedone to determine if these aggregates impact the diffusion of gas species through the grains,- a complete analysis of the impact of experimental conditions on the structure of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> will be presented,- carbon deposition has a strong impact on the performances of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier.</b> ConclusionThe modification of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> structure and composition has an impact on its performances in the CLC process(variation of methane conversion, …). A model was developed to represent one cycle of oxidation/reduction of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> in a previous study. The description of the modifications of the material will be used to extend the validity of this model to several cycles.

40|$|Chemical looping {{gasification}} (CLG) {{is considered}} as a novel gasification technology because gas-phase oxygen of the gasifying medium can be replaced by lattice oxygen of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier.</b> The gasifying mediums (e. g., pure O- 2 and steam) used as the oxygen source can apparently improve the char conversion in traditionally biomass gasification. Similarly, {{the objective of this}} study is to investigate char CLG with the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> as an individual oxygen source. A NiO-modified iron ore <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> was prepared by the impregnation method coupled with ultrasonic treatment. The characteristics of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> were analyzed by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and H- 2 temperature-programmed reduction (H- 2 -TPR). The formation of spinel-type nickel iron oxide NiFe 2 O 4 can evidently enhance the reactivity of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier.</b> The reduction of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> by biomass char was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) together with a fixed-bed reactor under an inert atmosphere. TGA tests show that the reactivity of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> increased with the increase of NiO loading. An optimal mass ratio of char/oxygen carrier is determined at 4 : 6 With the aim of obtaining a maximum reaction rate. The presence of spinel-type nickel iron oxide NiFe 2 O 4 apparently improved the reaction rate of char gasification. The fixed-bed gasification results show that CO was generated faster than other components because carbon was partially oxidized and H- 2 was quickly consumed by the lattice oxygen [O] of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier.</b> A relatively high carbon conversion of 55. 56 % was obtained in the char CLG, in comparison to that of char pyrolysis (5. 52 %). The lattice oxygen [O] of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> was fully consumed by biomass char. Moreover, biomass char was catalytically, pyrolyzed becausee the deep reduction products (metallic iron and nickel) can act as catalysts for char pyrolysis. XRD analysis shows that the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> was deeply reduced into Fe (Ni) alloy and Fe 3 C species during the reduction stage of Char CLG.

The prepared <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> was characterized in terms of the physical properties related to the fluidization, such as shape, particle size, packing density, and mechanical strength. The prepared <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> was, especially, notified with its excellent spherical shape and high mechanical strength at a sintering temperature of 1, 300  °C.

In this work, the focus has been on studying the effects of production parameters on the properties of this important <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier.</b> The effects of three production parameters, i. e., milling time, calcination temperature, and calcination time, were examined for the spray-dried particles. The time of ball milling for the slurry prepared for spray-drying was varied from 5 to 45 min, the calcination temperature from 1300 to 1350 degrees C, and the calcination time from 4 to 16 h.

40|$|The chemical-looping {{combustion}} (CLC) and chemical-looping {{with oxygen}} uncoupling (CLOU) processes are novel solutions for efficient combustion with inherent separation of carbon dioxide. These processes use a metal oxide as an <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> to transfer <b>oxygen</b> from an air reactor to a fuel reactor, where the fuel reacts with the solid <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier.</b> When solid fuel {{is used in}} CLC, the char must be gasified by, e. g., steam to form H 2 and CO, that can be subsequently oxidized to H 2 O and CO 2 by the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier.</b> In the case of CLOU, the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> releases <b>oxygen</b> gas in the fuel reactor.

The Fe 2 O 3 was almost completely reduced into metallic iron when the reaction temperature exceeded 1000 degrees C, but the carbon conversion of char only attained to 40. 80 % {{due to the lack of}} oxygen source under inert atmosphere. However, the carbon conversion of char apparently increased and the oxygen conversion of <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> dramatically decreased under oxidizing atmosphere (CO 2, or H 2 O). It is attributed to the fact that oxidizing agents can supply oxygen sources to promote char conversion as well as to alleviate the reduction of <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier.</b> These thermodynamic predictions were confirmed by TGA tests, where the char was fully converted into gas under CO 2, or H 2 O atmosphere because of enough oxygen sources but a low carbon conversion was obtained under inert atmosphere. TGA results further indicated that the reactivity of char with <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> under steam atmosphere is much higher than that under CO 2 atmosphere and the Fe 2 O 3 phase is mainly reduced into Fe 3 O 4 phase in all the tests. Additionally, several other different carriers (Al 2 O 3, NiO-modified iron ore and NiO) were employed to compare the reactivity of iron ore as well. The order of reactivity is speculated as follows: Pure oxygen approximate to NiO > H 2 O > Iron ore > CO 2 > Al 2 O 3. The reduced <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> can recover entire lattice oxygen [O] to its initial state under air atmosphere.
