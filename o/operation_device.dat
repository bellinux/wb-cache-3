40|$|In {{response}} to your Request For Information, I would like to submit my comments pertaining to reference to section C, Self-Contained Self-Rescuers (SCSR). From 1995 to 1996 I worked on the mechanical design team for a prototypical Oxygen Concentrator. The recent highly publicized tragedies in the mining industry brought to light how that technology may be made useful as an emergency breathing device for trapped miners.

Is there more effective technology to protect miners than the SCSRs currently available? If so, please describe. Two of the most prevalent technologies in use today for SCSRs are that of either chemical reactions or molecular sieves. A molecular sieve is essentially a re-breather that separates unwanted constituents of air and allows oxygen to pass through.

40|$|Emerging {{smart home}} platforms, which {{interface}} {{with a variety}} of physical devices and support third-party application development, currently use permission models inspired by smartphone operating systems-they group functionally similar <b>device</b> <b>operations</b> into separate units, and require users to grant apps access to devices at that granularity. Unfortunately, this leads to two issues: (1) apps that do not require access to all of the granted <b>device</b> <b>operations</b> have overprivileged access to them, (2) apps might pose a higher risk to users than needed because physical <b>device</b> <b>operations</b> are fundamentally risk- asymmetric-"door. unlock" provides access to burglars, and "door. lock" can potentially lead to getting locked out. Overprivileged apps with access to mixed-risk operations only increase the potential for damage. We present Tyche, a system that leverages the risk-asymmetry in physical <b>device</b> <b>operations</b> to limit the risk that apps pose to smart home users, without increasing the user's decision overhead. Tyche introduces the notion of risk-based permissions. When using risk-based permissions, <b>device</b> <b>operations</b> are grouped into units of similar risk, and users grant apps access to devices at that risk-based granularity.

40|$|Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) is an {{indispensable}} part of most modern VLSI designs and dominates silicon area in many applications. In scaled technologies, maintaining high SRAM yield becomes more challenging {{since they are}} particularly vulnerable to process variations due to 1) the minimum sized devices used in SRAM bitcells and 2) the large array sizes. At the same time, low power design is a key focus throughout the semiconductor industry. Since low voltage operation {{is one of the}} most effective ways to reduce power consumption due to its quadratic relationship to energy savings, lowering the minimum operating voltage (Vmin) of SRAM has gained significant interest. This thesis presents four different approaches to design and analyze robust low voltage SRAM: SRAM analysis method improvement, SRAM bitcell development, SRAM peripheral optimization, and advance device selection. We first describe a novel yield estimation method for bit-interleaved voltage-scaled 8 -T SRAMs. Instead of the traditional trade-off between write and read, the trade-off between write and half select disturb is analyzed. In addition, this analysis proposes a method to find an appropriate Write Word-Line (WWL) pulse width to maximize yield. Second, low leakage 10 -T SRAM with speed compensation scheme is proposed. During sleep mode of a sensor application, SRAM retaining data cannot be shut down so it is important to minimize leakage in SRAM. This work adopts several leakage reduction techniques while compensating performance. Third, adaptive write architecture for low voltage 8 -T SRAMs is proposed. By adaptively modulating WWL width and voltage level, it is possible to achieve low power consumption while maintaining high yield without excessive performance degradation. Finally, low power circuit design based on heterojunction tunneling transistors (HETTs) is discussed. HETTs have a steep subthreshold swing beneficial for low voltage <b>operation.</b> <b>Device</b> modeling and design of logic and SRAM are proposed...|$|E
40|$|CMOS VLSI circuit {{reliability}} {{modeling and}} simulation have attracted intense research interest {{in the last two}} decades, and as a result almost all IC Design For Reliability (DFR) tools now try to incrementally simulate device wearout mechanisms in iterative ways. These DFR tools are capable of accurately characterizing the device wearout process and predicting its impact on circuit performance. Nevertheless, excessive simulation time and tedious parameter testing process often limit popularity of these tools in product design and fabrication. This work develops a new SPICE reliability simulation method that shifts the focus of reliability analysis from device wearout to circuit functionality. A set of accelerated lifetime models and failure equivalent circuit models are proposed for the most common MOSFET intrinsic wearout mechanisms, including Hot Carrier Injection (HCI), Time Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB), and Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI). The accelerated lifetime models help to identify the most degraded transistors in a circuit in terms of the device's terminal voltage and current waveforms. Then corresponding failure equivalent circuit models are incorporated into the circuit to substitute these identified transistors. Finally, SPICE simulation is performed again to check circuit functionality and analyze the impact of device wearout on circuit <b>operation.</b> <b>Device</b> wearout effects are lumped into a very limited number of failure equivalent circuit model parameters, and circuit performance degradation and functionality are determined by the magnitude of these parameters. In this new method, it is unnecessary to perform a large number of small-step SPICE simulation iterations. Therefore, simulation time is obviously shortened in comparison to other tools. In addition, a reduced set of failure equivalent circuit model parameters, rather than a large number of device SPICE model parameters, need to be accurately characterized at each interim wearout process. Thus device testing and parameter extraction work are also significantly simplified. These advantages will allow circuit designers to perform quick and efficient circuit reliability analyses and to develop practical guidelines for reliable electronic designs...|$|E
