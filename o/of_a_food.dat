5|$|Deep frying (also {{referred}} to as deep fat frying) is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, rather than the shallow oil used in conventional frying, done in a frying pan. Normally, a deep fryer or chip pan is used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used. Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot. Deep frying is classified as hot-fat cooking method. Typically, deep frying foods cook quickly: all sides <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> are cooked simultaneously as oil has {{a high rate of}} heat conduction.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on 21January 1947, the UK {{experienced}} several cold spells {{that brought}} large drifts of snow to the country, blocking roads and railways, which caused problems transporting coal {{to the electric}} power stations. Many had to shut down, forcing severe restrictions to cut power consumption, including restricting domestic electricity to 19 hours per day and cutting some industrial supplies completely. In addition, radio broadcasts were limited, television services were suspended, some magazines were ordered to stop publishing, and newspapers were reduced in size. These measures, {{on top of the}} low temperatures, badly affected public morale and the Minister of Fuel and Power, Emanuel Shinwell, became a scapegoat; he received death threats and had to be placed under police guard. Towards the end of February, there were also fears <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> shortage as supplies were cut off and vegetables were frozen into the ground.|$|E

25|$|In 1927, Charles Elton {{published}} an influential synthesis {{on the use}} of food webs, which resulted in them becoming a central concept in ecology. In 1966, interest in food webs increased after Robert Paine's experimental and descriptive study of intertidal shores, suggesting that food web complexity was key to maintaining species diversity and ecological stability. Many theoretical ecologists, including Sir Robert May and Stuart Pimm, were prompted by this discovery and others to examine the mathematical properties of food webs. According to their analyses, complex food webs should be less stable than simple food webs. The apparent paradox between the complexity of food webs observed in nature and the mathematical fragility of food web models is currently an area of intensive study and debate. The paradox may be due partially to conceptual differences between persistence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> web and equilibrial stability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> web.|$|E

The eruv consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> item – in general bread – that is shared by all dwellers.

25|$|An {{elemental}} diet {{taken for}} two weeks is an alternative to antibiotics for eliminating SIBO. An elemental diet works via providing nutrition for the individual while depriving the bacteria <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> source. Additional treatment options {{include the use of}} prokinetic drugs such as 5-HT4 receptor agonists or motilin agonists to extend the SIBO free period after treatment with an elemental diet or antibiotics. A diet void of certain foods that feed the bacteria can help alleviate the symptoms. For example, if the symptoms are caused by bacterial overgrowth feeding on indigestible carbohydrate rich foods, following a FODMAP restriction diet may help.|$|E

Thus, the causative agent and the response are separated in time, and may not be obviously related. Food intolerance symptoms usually begin about half an hour after eating or drinking the food in question, but sometimes symptoms may be delayed by up to 48 hours.|$|E

25|$|Ascorbic acid is a weak sugar acid {{structurally}} {{related to}} glucose. In biological systems, ascorbic acid {{can be found}} only at low pH, but in neutral solutions above pH 5 is predominantly found in the ionized form, ascorbate. All of these molecules have vitamin C activity and thus are used synonymously with vitamin C, unless otherwise specified. Numerous analytical methods {{have been developed for}} ascorbic acid detection. For example, vitamin C content <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> sample such as fruit juice can be calculated by measuring the volume of the sample required to decolorize a solution of dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) and then calibrating the results by comparison with a known concentration of vitamin C.|$|E
25|$|Sea salt was {{a common}} {{condiment}} in ancient Hawaii, and Inamona, a relish made of roasted, mashed kukui nutmeats, sea salt and sometimes mixed with seaweeds, often accompanied the meals. At important occasions, a traditional feast, ‘aha‘aina, was held. When a woman was to have her first child, her husband started raising a pig for the ‘Aha‘aina Mawaewae feast that was celebrated {{for the birth of}} a child. Besides the pig, mullet, shrimp, crab, seaweeds and taro leaves were required for the feast. The modern name for such feasts, lū‘au, was not used until 1856, replacing the Hawaiian words ‘aha‘aina and pā‘ina. The name lū‘au came from the name <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> always served at a ‘aha‘aina — young taro tops baked with coconut milk and chicken or octopus.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{microwaving}} thin metal films {{can be seen}} clearly on a Compact Disc or DVD (particularly the factory pressed type). The microwaves induce electric currents in the metal film, which heats up, melting the plastic in the disc and leaving a visible pattern of concentric and radial scars. Similarly, porcelain with thin metal films can also be destroyed or damaged by microwaving. Aluminium foil is thick enough {{to be used in}} microwave ovens as a shield against heating parts of food items, if the foil is not badly warped. When wrinkled, aluminium foil is generally unsafe in microwaves, as manipulation of the foil causes sharp bends and gaps that invite sparking. The USDA recommends that aluminium foil used as a partial food shield in microwave cooking cover no more than one quarter <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> object, and be carefully smoothed to eliminate sparking hazards.|$|E
