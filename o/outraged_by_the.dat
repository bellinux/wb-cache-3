5|$|The {{legislature}} summoned {{everyone in}} the surrounding area who had any knowledge of the events at Saint Mary's, but found {{that no one was}} certain of Jennings's role in the commission. After a short debate, the House passed a resolution, voting 15 to 13, to recognize Jennings as governor and dropped it proceedings against him. The House votes opposing Jennings came largely from the state's western counties. Harrison was <b>outraged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> decision and resigned as lieutenant governor.|$|E
5|$|The Marsh family celebrates Grampa Marsh's 102nd birthday, but he {{is tired}} of living and tries unsuccessfully to commit suicide. He tries to {{convince}} Stan to kill him, but Stan refuses because he fears he might get in trouble. Meanwhile, Kyle watches the cartoon Terrance and Phillip, which revolves largely around fart jokes. Kyle's mother gets <b>outraged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> foul language and crude humor, and contacts other South Park parents to organize a boycott at the Cartoon Central headquarters in New York City. Later at school, Stan asks Mr. Garrison, Chef and Jesus whether he should help his grandpa kill himself, but they avoid discussing the issue, much to Stan's anger.|$|E
5|$|The May Revolution of 1810 {{marked the}} {{early stage of}} a process which later led to the {{disintegration}} of Spain's Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, independence and the eventual formation of Argentina. Rosas, like many landowners in the countryside, was suspicious of a movement advanced primarily by merchants and bureaucrats {{in the city of}} Buenos Aires. Rosas was specially <b>outraged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> execution of Viceroy Santiago Liniers {{at the hands of the}} revolutionaries. Rosas felt nostalgic about colonial times, seeing them as stable, orderly and prosperous.|$|E
50|$|According to Gilbert Burns, when a {{schoolmaster}} at Ayr, while drunk, said disrespectful {{things of}} Dr. Dalrymple, <b>the</b> resulting <b>outrage</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> people {{was so strong}} that he was obliged to leave the place and go to London.|$|R
50|$|In 1982, Fitzgerald {{was awarded}} a five-month $15,000 {{contract}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Nova Scotia Liquor Commission to study proposed changes to the Liquor Control Act. The appointment was met with <b>outrage</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Opposition in the House of Assembly and he resigned the appointment.|$|R
50|$|Although a {{substantial}} portion of his work was received with perplexity and <b>outrage</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> average movie-going audiences, he has been recognized by Portuguese and international critics and academicians, {{as one of the most}} important Portuguese directors, along with Manoel de Oliveira.|$|R
5|$|The {{controversy}} {{was triggered}} by allegations that, in February 1903, William Bayliss of the Department of Physiology at University College London performed an illegal vivisection, before an audience of 60 medical students, on a brown terrier dog—adequately anaesthetized, according to Bayliss and his team; conscious and struggling, according to the Swedish activists. The procedure was condemned as cruel and unlawful by the National Anti-Vivisection Society. Bayliss, whose research on dogs led {{to the discovery of}} hormones, was <b>outraged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> assault on his reputation. He sued for libel and won.|$|E
5|$|Madison, {{a member}} of the Democratic-Republican Party, was elected to the Democratic-Republican-dominated Virginia General Assembly from Orange County in 1799. A major item on his agenda was the defense of the General Assembly's 1798 Virginia Resolutions, of which Madison had been the draftsman. The Resolutions, usually {{discussed}} together with Thomas Jefferson's contemporaneous Kentucky Resolutions, were a response to various perceived outrages perpetrated by the Federalist-dominated national government. The most significant of these were the Alien and Sedition Acts, four laws that allowed the President to deport aliens at will, required a longer period of residence before aliens could become citizens, and made it a crime to publish malicious or defamatory material against the government or its officials. Democratic-Republicans were <b>outraged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> legislation, and Madison and Jefferson drafted the highly critical Resolutions adopted in response by the Virginia and Kentucky state legislatures.|$|E
5|$|Offa's {{diplomatic}} relations with Europe are well documented, but appear to belong only to the last dozen years of his reign. In letters dating from the late 780s or early 790s, Alcuin congratulates Offa for encouraging education and greets Offa's wife and son, Cynethryth and Ecgfrith. In about 789, or shortly before, Charlemagne proposed that his son Charles marry one of Offa's daughters, most likely Ælfflæd. Offa countered with a request that his son Ecgfrith should also marry Charlemagne's daughter Bertha: Charlemagne was <b>outraged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> request, and broke off contact with Britain, forbidding English ships from landing in his ports. Alcuin's letters {{make it clear that}} by the end of 790 the dispute was still not resolved, and that Alcuin was hoping to be sent to help make peace. In the end {{diplomatic relations}} were restored, at least partly by the agency of Gervold, the abbot of St Wandrille.|$|E
5000|$|He {{exercised}} his critical humanism {{about the}} moral and social disruption arising from Western style neoliberalism and the brutalities of capitalism. In reference to this, he added his grain of sand to the Anti-austerity movement in Spain during May 2011 <b>by</b> writing <b>the</b> preface to the Spanish edition of the book [...] Time for <b>Outrage</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> French diplomat Stéphane Hessel.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2011, the Attorney General Dominic Grieve {{ruled out}} {{applying}} to the High Court for an inquest, {{saying that the}} evidence Kelly had committed suicide was 'overwhelming'.

He added: ...|$|R
5000|$|In May 2016, Justice Minister Heiko Maas {{announced}} that gay and bi {{men who were}} convicted of same-sex sexual activity after World War II would have their convictions overturned. Mr Maas said the following in a statement: We {{will never be able}} to eliminate completely these <b>outrages</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> state, but we want to rehabilitate the victims. The homosexual men who were convicted should no longer have to live with the taint of conviction.|$|R
5|$|The crisis {{between the}} monarch {{and his former}} {{minister}} was felt immediately within the Constituent and Legislative General Assembly, which had been elected {{for the purpose of}} drafting a Constitution. A member of the Constituent Assembly, Bonifácio resorted to demagoguery, alleging the existence of a major Portuguese conspiracy against Brazilian interests—insinuating that PedroI, who had been born in Portugal, was implicated. The Emperor became <b>outraged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> invective directed at the loyalty of citizens who were of Portuguese birth and the hints that he was himself conflicted in his allegiance to Brazil. On 12 November 1823, PedroI ordered the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly and called for new elections. On the following day, he placed a newly established native Council of State in charge of composing a constitutional draft. Copies of the draft were sent to all town councils, and the vast majority voted in favor of its instant adoption as the Constitution of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese were <b>outraged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{attack on}} the factory {{and the death of}} their comrades and seized 10 Arab {{merchant}} ships at anchor in the harbor. Around 600 of their crews were killed and the cargoes confiscated before the merchantmen were set afire. Cabral also ordered his ships to bombard Calicut for an entire day in reprisal for the violation of the agreement. The massacre was blamed in part on Portuguese animosity towards Muslims, which had developed over centuries of conflict with the Moors on the Iberian peninsula and in North Africa. Moreover, the Portuguese were determined to dominate the spice trade and had no intention of allowing competition to flourish. The Arabs also had no desire to allow the Portuguese to break their monopoly on access to spices. The Portuguese had started out by insisting on being given preferential treatment in every aspect of the trade. The letter from King Manuel I brought by Cabral to the ruler of Calicut, which was translated by the ruler's Arab interpreters, sought the exclusion of Arab traders. The Muslim merchants believed that they were about to lose both their trading opportunities and livelihoods, and attempted to sway the Hindu ruler against the Portuguese. The Portuguese and Arabs were extremely suspicious of each other's every action.|$|E
5|$|There was {{considerable}} debate about which person or house of Congress was authorized {{to decide between}} the competing slates of electors, with the Republican Senate and the Democratic House each claiming priority. By January 1877, with the question still unresolved, Congress and President Grant agreed to submit the matter to a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which would be authorized to determine {{the fate of the}} disputed electoral votes. The Commission was to be made up of five representatives, five senators, and five Supreme Court justices. To ensure partisan balance, there would be seven Democrats and seven Republicans, with Justice David Davis, an independent respected by both parties, as the fifteenth member. The balance was upset when Democrats in the Illinois legislature elected Davis to the Senate, hoping to sway his vote. Davis disappointed Democrats by refusing to serve on the Commission because of his election to the Senate. As all of the remaining Justices were Republicans, Justice Joseph P. Bradley, believed to be the most independent-minded of them, was selected to take Davis's place on the Commission. The Commission met in February and the eight Republicans voted to award all 20 electoral votes to Hayes. Democrats were <b>outraged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> result and attempted a filibuster to prevent Congress from accepting the Commission's findings.|$|E
5000|$|Part of {{the humor}} of [...] "No Bull" [...] was that each column was [...] "part one," [...] yet part two would never come. Instead, {{there would be}} a fresh series of <b>outrages</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> blithely {{destructive}} [...] "Big Bill" [...] in South America. An exception to this pattern was a faux telegraph that appeared in issue six, in which Hornyak asked the South American Explorers Club for support in a supposed plan to excavate Machu Picchu with copious amounts of high explosives.|$|R
50|$|A {{historic}} {{use of a}} spring-gun {{occurred during}} the night of June 3 or early morning of June 4, 1775, when a spring-gun set <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British to protect the military stores in the Magazine in Williamsburg, Virginia, wounded two young men who had broken in. <b>The</b> subsequent <b>outrage</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> local population {{proved to be the}} final act of the Gunpowder Incident, leading Governor Dunmore to flee the city to a British warship and declare the Commonwealth of Virginia in a state of rebellion.|$|R

5|$|The Ostsack (east sack) of the Krivasoo bridgehead, {{defended by}} the Soviet 6th and the 117th Rifle Corps, were {{confused}} by the Strachwitz Battle Group's diversionary attack on 6 April. The attack deceived the Soviet forces into thinking that the German attack intended to cut them out from the west flank. The actual assault came directly at the 59th Army and started with a heavy bombardment. The positions of the 59th Army were attacked by dive bombers and the forest there was set afire. At the same time, the 61st Infantry Division and the Strachwitz tank squadron pierced deep into the 59th Army's defences, splitting the two rifle corps apart and forcing them to retreat to their fortifications. Marshal of the Soviet Union Leonid Govorov was <b>outraged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> news, sending in the freshly re-deployed 8th Army. Their attempt {{to cut off the}} Tiger I tanks was repelled by Lieutenant Günther Famula, who received a posthumous Knight's Cross for these actions, keeping their supply lines open. On 7 April, Govorov ordered his troops to switch on to the defensive. The 59th Army, having lost another 5,700 troops from all causes, was withdrawn from the bridgehead. For these successes Strachwitz received the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds on 15 April 1944. News of the award had reached his headquarters on the early morning of 15 April via teleprinter message. The official presentation was made a few weeks later by Hitler.|$|E
25|$|By late afternoon, Freikorps {{ammunition}} {{was running}} low. Calling truce, Berthold negotiated a safe passage {{for those of}} his men who would disarm. At about 18:00 hours, the Freikorps filed out of the schoolhouse to disarm. A crowd of onlookers had not {{been part of the}} negotiations. They were <b>outraged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> civilian casualties, and they mobbed the Freikorps.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{women were}} <b>outraged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{inherent}} inequity and misogyny of the legislation. For the first time, women {{in large numbers}} took up the rights of prostitutes. Prominent critics included Blackwell, Nightingale, Martineau, and Elizabeth Wolstenholme. Elizabeth Garrett, unlike her sister, Millicent, {{did not support the}} campaign, though she later admitted that the campaign had done well.|$|E

5000|$|In {{conclusion}} to the chapter, Kozol describes a microcosmic {{example in the}} Roosevelt School District of New York. A proposal was made to dissolve the impoverished, mostly minority district and absorb {{the small number of}} students into the surrounding school district, East Meadow, with a mostly white student population. This proposal went through initially but was met with <b>outrage</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> East Meadow community and was eventually overturned. Kozol views this as a missed [...] "opportunity to end the education apartheid of a small community of children".|$|R

The Chauci were <b>outraged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> act of bad faith, so the emperor Claudius forbade further attacks on the Germans in an effort to ease tensions, and the Romans withdrew to the Rhine.|$|E
25|$|The {{public is}} <b>outraged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{apparent}} obscurity {{of the subject}} matter, and the predominance of the elementary geometrical shapes, which give rise to the term 'Cubism'. Although the term 'cube' has been used before {{with respect to the}} works of Metzinger (1906), Delaunay and Metzinger (1907), and Georges Braque (1908), {{this is the first time}} the word 'Cubism' is used. The designation becomes widespread as an artistic movement.|$|E
25|$|Anti-slavery advocates were <b>outraged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{murder of}} Elijah Parish Lovejoy, {{a white man}} and editor of an {{abolitionist}} newspaper on 7 November 1837, by a pro-slavery mob in Illinois. Nearly all Northern politicians rejected the extreme positions of the abolitionists; Abraham Lincoln, for example. Indeed, many Northern leaders including Lincoln, Stephen Douglas (the Democratic nominee in 1860), John C. Fremont (the Republican nominee in 1856), and Ulysses S. Grant married into slave-owning Southern families without any moral qualms.|$|E

50|$|In 1879, Wilson and {{the first}} Prime Minister of Egypt, Nubar Pasha, were the victims of a serious <b>outrage</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mob {{in the streets of}} Cairo - an {{incident}} which was the direct precursor of the Arabi revolt and the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. In April 1880, on the fall of the Khedive Ismail and the inauguration of his son Tewfik as Khedive, Wilson was appointed president of the Commission for the Liquidation of the Egyptian Debt, with full powers to regulate the financial position of Egypt. On the conclusion of this duty he returned to his post in London.|$|R

25|$|Many {{participants}} in the riot stood and posed for photographs, with some even posting the photos on their own social media accounts. Photos and videos were also taken by onlookers intent on documenting the riot. In the aftermath, those photos and videos were used by many local people <b>outraged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> riot, {{in an effort to}} tag and identify rioters and looters on Facebook, YouTube, and other social media sites, and to provide additional information to police for prosecution.|$|E
25|$|As Wilson {{departed}} Key West, {{he made an}} off-hand {{remark that}} he believed the WSB recommendations would seriously destabilize the economy. Murray was <b>outraged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> statement, and declared that it was Wilson who had wrecked national economic stabilization policy. Although Murray said he remained committed to resuming bargaining on March 26, he refused to meet with Wilson. Murray, working with Goldberg, had initially prepared a much stronger statement, but Feinsinger successfully pleaded with him to moderate his tone and language.|$|E
25|$|In 1685, Aurangzeb {{dispatched}} his son, Muhammad Azam Shah, with a {{force of}} nearly 50,000 men to capture Bijapur Fort and defeat Sikandar Adil Shah (the ruler of Bijapur) who refused to be a vassal. The Mughals could not make any advancements upon Bijapur Fort {{mainly because of the}} superior usage of cannon batteries on both sides. <b>Outraged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> stalemate Aurangzeb himself arrived on 4 September 1686 and commanded the Siege of Bijapur; after eight days of fighting, the Mughals were victorious.|$|E

60|$|When {{arrived at}} the head of the falls, the mischievous spirit of the savages broke out, and they were on the point of {{destroying}} the canoes, doubtless with a view to impede the white men from carrying forward their goods, and laying them open to further pilfering. They were with some difficulty prevented from committing this <b>outrage</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> interference of an old man, who appeared to have authority among them; and, in consequence of his harangue, the whole of the hostile band, with the exception of about fifty, crossed to the north side of the river, where they lay in wait, ready for further mischief.|$|R
