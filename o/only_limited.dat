5|$|As the Khmer Rouge had no {{air force}} and <b>only</b> <b>limited</b> {{anti-aircraft}} capability, no fleet air cover was necessary, but the evacuation was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand. It was suspected that the Khmer Rouge might possess SA-7 shoulder-launched surface to air missiles and so the evacuation helicopters were painted with infra-red low-reflective paint and equipped with ALE-29 flare dispensers.|$|E
5|$|Bromine has {{sometimes}} been considered to be possibly essential in humans, but this is supported by <b>only</b> <b>limited</b> circumstantial evidence, and no clear biological role. As a pharmaceutical, the simple bromide ion (Br−) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as antiepileptics.|$|E

5|$|Due to delays with {{delivery}} of jet engines {{and production of}} the XP-84A, the Thunderjet had undergone <b>only</b> <b>limited</b> flight testing by the time production P-84Bs began to roll out of the factory in 1947. In particular, the impact of wingtip tanks on aircraft handling was not thoroughly studied. This proved problematic later.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise was {{intentionally}} {{equipped with}} less advanced versions of technologies seen in previous series. For example, {{it has no}} tractor beam, uses missiles instead of photon torpedoes, and has <b>only</b> <b>limited</b> means of synthesizing foods and other consumable items. Communications Officer Linguist Hoshi Sato's expertise in linguistics helps compensate {{for the lack of}} advanced universal translators.|$|E
5|$|North American {{predators and}} parasitoids can {{occasionally}} cause high emerald ash borer mortality, but generally offer <b>only</b> <b>limited</b> control. Mortality due to native woodpeckers is variable. Parasitism by parasitoids such as Atanycolus cappaerti can be high, but overall such control is generally low.|$|E

5|$|Other molybdenum-based alloys that do {{not contain}} iron have <b>only</b> <b>limited</b> applications. For example, because of its {{resistance}} to molten zinc, both pure molybdenum and molybdenum/tungsten alloy (70%/30%) are used for piping, stirrers and pump impellers that {{come into contact with}} molten zinc.|$|E
5|$|The Ramones were an American {{punk rock}} band that {{formed in the}} New York City {{neighborhood}} of Forest Hills, Queens, in 1974. They are often cited as the first band to define the punk rock sound. Despite achieving <b>only</b> <b>limited</b> commercial success, the band was {{a major influence on}} the 1970s punk movement in both the United States and United Kingdom.|$|E

The new version was pressed on 140 gram colored pink vinyl and was <b>only</b> <b>limited</b> to 4,500 copies.|$|E

5|$|This {{battle was}} the final major Japanese {{offensive}} in the Solomon Islands campaign. Following the engagement the Japanese force withdrew from the Empress Augusta Bay area, and <b>only</b> <b>limited</b> fighting took place until late 1944 when Australian troops took over from the Americans and {{began a series of}} advances across the island which continued {{until the end of the}} war in August 1945.|$|E
5|$|Titanium is {{non-toxic}} even {{in large}} doses {{and does not}} play any natural role inside the human body. Zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only contact with the eyes requires medical attention. OSHA recommendations for zirconium are 5mg/m3 time weighted average limit and a 10mg/m3 short-term exposure limit. <b>Only</b> <b>limited</b> data exists on the toxicology of hafnium.|$|E
5|$|To {{improve the}} {{leaching}} {{process in the}} gold cyanidation, lead(II) nitrate solution is added. Although a bulk process, <b>only</b> <b>limited</b> amounts (10 to 100milligrams lead(II) nitrate per kilogram gold) are required. Both the cyanidation itself, {{as well as the}} use of lead compounds in the process, are deemed controversial due to the compounds' toxic nature.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Okinawa in July, Guam {{was assigned to}} Cruiser Task Force 95, where she served as the flagship, along with her sister Alaska, {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Francis S. Low. On 16 July, Guam and Alaska conducted a sweep into the East China and Yellow Seas to sink Japanese shipping. They had <b>only</b> <b>limited</b> success, however, and returned to the fleet on 23 July. They then joined a major raid, which included three battleships and three escort carriers, into the estuary of the Yangtze River off Shanghai. Again, the operation met with limited success, and they returned to Okinawa by 7 August.|$|E
5|$|All of the aircrew {{involved}} in the crash had <b>only</b> <b>limited</b> flying time {{in the months before}} the crash. The B-52's aircrew were apparently unaware that the aircraft had stalled until shortly before impact, indicated by a failure to apply standard recovery techniques to the aircraft once it entered the stall. The investigation reported that, even if the proper stall recovery techniques had been applied, the aircraft was likely too low to recover before hitting the ground.|$|E
5|$|At the {{national}} competition, Schools compete based on size and {{are divided into}} three divisions (I, II, and III). However, this separation is <b>only</b> <b>limited</b> to overall team score and overall individual score. Nine overall team medals are awarded: gold, silver and bronze for each division. Similarly, 27 overall individual medals are awarded: gold, silver and bronze for Honors, Scholastic, and Varsity in each division. The rest of the medals—for example, gold in art for Honors, or silver in math for Varsity—are awarded to the top scoring persons regardless of division. In addition, winning teams have often been invited to meet the President of the United States.|$|E

5|$|During Voltas {{service with}} the French Navy, she saw <b>only</b> <b>limited</b> action. Following the {{outbreak}} of the war, she took part in convoy escort duties initially before being withdrawn to Brest for refit. On 3 July 1940, when the British attacked the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir, Volta managed to escape without damage and sought refuge in Toulon. When the Germans tried to seize her {{along with the rest of}} the fleet on 27 November 1942, however, she was scuttled in Toulon Harbour by her crew to prevent her from being captured.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} 20 years of settlement, there was <b>only</b> <b>limited</b> {{contact between the}} {{settlers}} and Aboriginal people. Joseph Franklin purchased land in the Brindabellas in 1849 and attempted {{to set up a}} cattle farm. His livestock were slaughtered by the local Aboriginal people and he was driven back out of the mountains. The rush of prospectors into the Kiandra area through the Brindabellas and the mountains {{to the west of the}} ACT as a result of the Kiandra goldrush led to conflict with the Aboriginal people. By the time Franklin returned to the Brindabellas in 1863, the indigenous population had been significantly reduced.|$|E
5|$|Early Tiger IIs proved unreliable, owing principally to leaking {{seals and}} gaskets, and an {{overburdened}} drive train originally intended for a lighter vehicle. The double radius steering gear was initially particularly prone to failure. Lack of crew training could amplify this problem; drivers originally given <b>only</b> <b>limited</b> training on other tanks were often sent directly to operational units already {{on their way}} to the front.|$|E
