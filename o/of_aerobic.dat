5|$|Common {{threshers}} are active, strong swimmers; {{there are}} infrequent reports of them leaping {{completely out of}} the water. Like the fast-swimming sharks of the family Lamnidae, the common thresher has a strip <b>of</b> <b>aerobic</b> red muscle along its flank that is able to contract powerfully and efficiently for long periods of time. In addition, they have slow-oxidative muscles centrally located within their bodies and a blood vessel countercurrent exchange system called the rete mirabile ("wonderful net"), allowing them to generate and retain body heat. The temperature inside the red muscles of a common thresher averages 2°C (3.6°F) above that of the ambient seawater, though there is significant individual variation. Unlike the pelagic and bigeye threshers, the common thresher lacks an orbital rete mirabile to protect its eyes and brain from temperature changes.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled the proliferation <b>of</b> <b>aerobic</b> organisms and, indirectly, {{the formation of}} the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the first}} billion years of Earth's history, life {{appeared}} in the oceans and began to affect the Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation <b>of</b> <b>aerobic</b> and anaerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago.

Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely; most species have not been described.

40|$|Background Intercellular {{communication}} in cardiac muscle is effected by connexin, particularly connexin 43 (Cx 43), forming gap junctions in cardiomyocytes. Aerobic physical exercise {{may result in}} increased left ventricular size and function. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to assess the effect <b>of</b> <b>aerobics</b> and detraining on C 43 expression and distribution in rats. Methods This was an in vivo experimental study on 32 young male Wistar rats. The animals were divided into the following 8 groups and their interventions: I : 4 weeks <b>of</b> <b>aerobics</b> (A 4); II: exercise control for 4 weeks (C 4); III: 4 weeks <b>of</b> <b>aerobics</b> plus 4 weeks of detraining (A 4 D 4); IV: 8 -week control (C 8); V: 12 weeks <b>of</b> <b>aerobics</b> (A 12); VI: 12 -week control (C 12); VII: 12 weeks <b>of</b> <b>aerobics</b> plus 4 weeks of detraining (A 12 D 4); VIII: 16 -week control (C 16). Rat cardiac tissue was subjected to immunohistochemical assay to determine total Cx 43, intercalated disc Cx 43, and lateral Cx 43. Independent t-test was used to compare all Cx 43 parameters between control and treatment groups. Results After aerobics, there were significant differences in total Cx 43, intercalated disc Cx 43, lateral Cx 43, and intercalated disc Cx 43 and lateral Cx 43 percentages between control and treatment groups (p< 0. 05). Between-group comparison in treatment groups did not find significant differences between exercise-only groups and groups with exercise plus detraining. Cx 43 surface area tended to decrease after detraining. Conclusions Aerobics significantly increases Cx 43 levels in rat hearts. Detraining decreases intercalated disc Cx 43 and lateral Cx 43...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the behaviour and perceptions <b>of</b> women in <b>aerobic</b> or exercise to music classes.

A naturalistic method of study was chosen in order to gain a comprehensive view of the subjective experience <b>of</b> <b>aerobics</b> participation. Approximately fifty female health club members were observed over a three month period in order to identify and describe patterns of involvement, behaviour and perception and the factors affecting them. Six groups of women were identified. These were ‘Naturals’, ‘Compulsive’, ‘Functional Feminist’. Several factors were observed as potentially contributing to the patterns observed. These included attitude toward perceived cultural ideals and pressures of female expectation and shape, perceptions <b>of</b> <b>aerobics</b> and exercise, pre-occupation with slenderness and bodyshape, self-image and body image.
