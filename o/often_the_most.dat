5|$|<b>Often</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{senior and}} {{responsible}} Patrol Leader is appointed as Troop Leader (TL), {{who no longer}} runs a Patrol but instead has other responsibilities such as enforcing discipline and running the weekly programme. Since a Troop Leader {{is not required to}} plan or run Patrol camps, or help Scouts through the advancement program many senior Scouts who are in their final year of school choose to become Troop Leaders to have more time to concentrate on their studies and on achieving the Springbok award.|$|E
5|$|As <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{abundant}} apex predator {{within its}} ecosystem, the {{blacktip reef shark}} {{plays a major role}} in structuring inshore ecological communities. Its diet is composed primarily of small teleost fishes, including mullet, groupers, grunters, jacks, mojarras, wrasses, surgeonfish, and smelt-whitings. Groups of blacktip reef sharks in the Indian Ocean have been observed herding schools of mullet against the shore for easier feeding. Squid, octopus, cuttlefish, shrimp, and mantis shrimp are also taken, as well as carrion and smaller sharks and rays, though this is rare. Off northern Australia, this species is known to consume sea snakes, including Acrochordus granulatus, Hydrelaps darwiniensis, Hydrophis spp. and Lapemis hardwickii. Sharks off Palmyra Atoll have been documented preying on seabird chicks that have fallen out of their nests into the water. Miscellaneous items that have been found inside the stomachs of this species include algae, turtle grass, coral, hydrozoa, bryozoa, rats, and stones.|$|E
5|$|At Shimer, the {{professor}} is a facilitator, a guide on the side, not a sage {{on the stage}} – encouraging each student {{to contribute to the}} intellectual light being kindled in every class. Each student is expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other’s insights, actively taking part in every discussion.... Students know their insights matter; they have something to offer to their peers, and {{to the life of the}} text being discussed. Some students are more exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; others may be a bit shy. The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can have the courage to ask what they think might be a stupid question. What are feared to be stupid questions are <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> provocative ones.|$|E
25|$|Zipf's law {{in corpus}} {{analysis}} and population distributions amongst others, where frequency of an item or event is {{inversely proportional to}} its frequency rank (i.e. <b>the</b> second <b>most</b> frequent item/event occurs half as <b>often</b> as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> frequent item, <b>the</b> third <b>most</b> frequent item/event occurs one third as <b>often</b> as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> frequent item, and so on).|$|R

5|$|GameSpot and GameSpy {{called the}} dialog sharply written, with many memorable lines. Eurogamer {{noted that the}} characters' {{frequent}} use of vulgar language worked; written as real people, such language fit their character rather than giving the game an adult veneer. The website appreciated the breadth of dialog options, allowing the player greater control of how to play their character. PC Zone opined that the quantity of well-written dialog did not guarantee quality; many player choices seemed to have little effect on a conversation's outcome, and the best response was <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> obvious. The voice acting was repeatedly praised for the actors' quality {{and the amount of}} voice work, due to the many dialog options.|$|E
5|$|When a tooth is lost, dentures, bridges, or {{implants}} {{may be used}} as replacements. Dentures {{are usually}} the least costly whereas implants are usually the most expensive. Dentures may replace complete arches of the mouth or only a partial number of teeth. Bridges replace smaller spaces of missing teeth and use adjacent teeth to support the restoration. Dental implants may be used to replace a single tooth or a series of teeth. Though implants are the most expensive treatment option, they are <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> desirable restoration because of their aesthetics and function. To improve the function of dentures, implants {{may be used as}} support.|$|E
5|$|During the season, a {{total of}} sixteen {{tropical}} cyclones developed, featuring ten hurricanes, four tropical storms and two tropical depressions. These totals {{are close to the}} climatological averages established since 1966, when satellite surveillance began. However, the season was less active than 1990, which had a record 16 hurricanes (more than 1991). On the other hand, it ended late with the first November hurricane since 1966. On the other hand, the months of July and August, <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> active ones in this basin, only produced two tropical cyclones each. The activity in July is four systems below the average of six at that time due to unusual circulation patterns aloft over the tropical Pacific. A shorter gap from late August to early September was attributed to anomalous flow patterns near the Baja California Peninsula. Several tropical cyclones grew into specially long-lived and intense systems. For example, Hurricane Kevin endured as a hurricane for 12½ days to the east of 140°W, establishing a new record for longevity in the eastern Pacific.|$|E

5|$|Suillus pungens is an ectomycorrhizal (EM) {{basidiomycete}} {{that forms}} symbiotic relationships almost exclusively with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) and bishop pine (Pinus muricata); some collections {{have been made}} under knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), but only {{within the range of}} Monterey pine. All these trees have small scattered natural ranges largely restricted to California. An EM symbiosis is a mutualistic relationship between an EM fungus and the root tip of a compatible EM plant. The fruit bodies of Suillus pungens grow solitarily, scattered or in groups in humus. They are often found growing near fruit bodies of Chroogomphus vinicolor and Helvella lacunosa. Suillus pungens is <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> abundant Suillus in the San Francisco Bay Area. The type collection was made on the campus of San Francisco State University in San Francisco, where it occurs in abundance during the fall and winter seasons. Although it occurs most frequently in the autumn and winter, {{it is one of the}} few species of Suillus that continue to fruit sporadically throughout the year, especially in wet weather. It has also been identified in the southeastern Sierra Nevada and on Santa Cruz Island.|$|E
5|$|Under the magnates {{were the}} barons, who held {{increasingly}} nominal feudal tenures of which an important vestige {{was the right}} to hold baronial courts, which could deal with both matters of land ownership and interpersonal offences, including minor acts of violence. Also important were the local tenants-in-chief, who held legally held their land directly from the king and who by this period were often the major local landholders in an area. In this period, as feudal distinctions declined, the barons and tenants-in-chief merged {{to form a new}} identifiable group, the lairds. This group was roughly equivalent to the English gentlemen. Just as the magnates saw themselves as the king's natural counsellors, so the lairds advised and exerted influence over the dukes and earls. The lairds were <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important individual in a local community. They ran baronial courts, acted as sheriffs-depute, sat on local assizes and were called in as private arbitrators. In the course of the sixteenth century they would acquire a role in national politics, gaining representation in Parliament and playing {{a major role in the}} Reformation crisis of 1560. As a result of the Reformation and the creation of a Presbyterian Kirk, their position in local society was enhanced. They often gained the new status of elder and greater oversight of the behaviour of the local population through the disciplinary functions of kirk sessions.|$|E

25|$|As {{was common}} in ancient {{mathematical}} texts, when a proposition needed proof {{in several different}} cases, Euclid often proved {{only one of them}} (<b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> difficult), leaving the others to the reader.

25|$|Portland {{pozzolan}} cement includes fly ash cement, since fly ash is a pozzolan, {{but also}} includes cements made from other natural or artificial pozzolans. In countries where volcanic ashes are available (e.g. Italy, Chile, Mexico, the Philippines) these cements are <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common form in use. The maximum replacement ratios are generally defined as for Portland-fly ash cement.|$|E
25|$|Like {{other ethnic}} groups, WASPs live in {{proximity}} {{of each other}} in close social circles.

25|$|The {{initial public}} {{offering}} of stocks and bonds to investors is by definition done in the primary market and subsequent trading {{is done in the}} secondary market.

25|$|Valves used in {{floodgate}} applications have {{a variety}} of design requirements and are usually located at the base of dams. <b>Often,</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important requirement (besides regulating flow) is energy dissipation. Since water is very heavy, it exits the base of a dam with the enormous force of water pushing from above. Unless this energy is dissipated, the flow can erode nearby rock and soil and damage structures.|$|E
25|$|The reef face is {{the zone}} above the reef floor or the reef drop-off. This zone is <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> diverse {{area of the}} reef. Coral and {{calcareous}} algae growths provide complex habitats and areas which offer protection, such as cracks and crevices. Invertebrates and epiphytic algae provide much of the food for other organisms. A common feature on this forereef zone is spur and groove formations which serve to transport sediment downslope.|$|E
