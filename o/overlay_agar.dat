The species diversity in organically grown wheat, spelt and rye was investigated in order to find strains suitable for sourdough fermentation. Colonies representing various morphological appearances were isolated and catalase-negative colonies were identified by mass spectrometer Microflex LT ™ MALDI-TOF. The fermentation products (lactic, acetic, formic and phenyllactic acid) were determined by high performance liquid chromatography, while the antifungal activity was determined using an <b>overlay</b> <b>agar</b> method. Wheat flours showed less microbial biodiversity than the rye and spelt flours. The most common genera in the tested flour were Lactobacillus, Pediococcus and Enterococcus. Isolated Lactobacillus farciminis, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Leuconostoc citreum and Lactobacillus brevis showed the best acidification activity. Lactobacillus brevis, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Weissella cibaria and Lactobacillus farciminis showed significant antifungal activity against A. niger 357 and Penicillium sp. 505.

40|$|Thirty-one of 104 {{clinical}} isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae {{collected over}} a period of 8 months were found to be putative extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producers. Isoelectric focusing and an iodine <b>overlay</b> <b>agar</b> method were used for preliminary identification of the ESBLs. They were further identified by DNA sequencing. Seventy-one percent of the isolates were found to produce SHV- 5. The variation in the ESBL patterns of these isolates was slight, with only five patterns being identified. The strains were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and 16 different genotypes were identified. When the PFGE patterns were analyzed by the algorithmic clustering method called the unweighted-pair group method using arithmetic averages, five clusters were found. However, significant genetic variations were found among 11 isolates and between each cluster. A plasmid of 36 kb was found in all clinical isolates and in the transconjugants. Our results indicate that {{the increase in the number}} of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates in this hospital is due mainly to the dissemination of a resistance plasmid rather than to the clonal spread of a few epidemic strains...|$|E

40|$|About 22, 000 1 -methyl- 3 -nitro- 1 -nitrosoguanidine- and UV-induced mutants of the rubber-degrading {{bacterium}} Streptomyces sp. strain K 30 {{were characterized}} for {{the ability to}} produce clear zones on natural rubber latex <b>overlay</b> <b>agar</b> plates. Thirty-five mutants were defective solely in cleavage of rubber and were phenotypically complemented with the wild-type lcp (latex clearing protein) gene. Sixty-nine mutants exhibited a pleiotropic phenotype and were impaired in utilization of rubber and xylan, indicating that the enzymes responsible for the initial cleavage of these polymers are exported by the same secretion pathway (Q. K. Beg, M. Kapoor, L. Mahajan, and G. S. Hoondal, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 56 : 326 - 3381, 2001; U. K. Laemmli, Nature 227 : 680 - 685, 1970). Analysis of the amino acid sequence encoded by lcp revealed a twin-arginine motif, indicating that Lcp is a substrate of the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway (K. Dilks, W. Rose, E. Hartmann, and M. Pohlschröder, J. Bacteriol. 185 : 1478 - 1483, 2003). A tatC disruption mutant of Streptomyces lividans 10 - 164 harboring lcp from Streptomyces sp. strain K 30 was not capable of forming clear zones on rubber <b>overlay</b> <b>agar</b> plates. Moreover, Lcp and enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion proteins were detected in the supernatant. Using Escherichia coli having the twin-arginine motif in the signal peptide upstream of Lcp, clear evidence that Lcp is secreted was obtained. Transcriptional analysis revealed basal expression of Lcp in glucose-grown cells and that transcription of lcp is obviously induced {{in the presence of}} poly(cis- 1, 4 -isoprene). In contrast, oxiB and oxiA, which are located directly downstream of lcp and putatively encode a heteromultimeric aldehyde dehydrogenase oxidizing the primary cleavage products generated by Lcp from poly(cis- 1, 4 -isoprene), were expressed only in the presence of poly(cis- 1, 4 -isoprene). Expression of lcp at a low level is thus required for sensing the polymer in the medium. Rubber degradation products may then induce the transcription of genes coding for enzymes catalyzing the later steps of poly(cis- 1, 4 -isoprene) degradation and the transcription of lcp itself. lcp, oxiB, and oxiA seem to constitute an operon, as a polycistronic mRNA comprising these three genes was detected. The transcriptional start site of lcp was mapped 400 bp upstream of the lcp start codon...|$|E

40|$|Two {{standardized}} disk diffusion susceptibility {{testing methods}} were compared using Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{and members of}} the Enterobacteriaceae. The standard Bauer-Kirby method and the <b>agar</b> <b>overlay</b> method of Barry et al. were compared using carbenicillin (50 - and 100 -μg disks), gentamicin, polymyxin B, and colistin sulfate. Both methods gave nearly comparable zone sizes with the enteric bacilli. However, with P. aeruginosa the <b>agar</b> <b>overlay</b> method gave zones 1 to 2 mm smaller than the Bauer-Kirby method with all drugs except gentamicin. In spite of these small differences, further examination of minimal inhibitory concentration-zone size correlations indicated that the same interpretive zone standards can be applied to either diffusion technique. For testing carbenicillin against Pseudomonas sp., 50 -μg disks were unsatisfactory, especially with the <b>agar</b> <b>overlay</b> method; 100 -μg disks were far superior with both methods...|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} agar {{overlay technique}} {{was developed for}} detecting antibiotic production by Streptomyces isolates and compared with two routinely used overlay procedures and the shake flask-disk assay method. Two types of inhibitory patterns could be discerned in the modified overlay method, and one of these was always exhibited by Streptomyces isolates which produced extractable antimicrobial substances. In a preliminary screening of 600 isolates, higher numbers of antibiotic-producing streptomyces were detected with the modified overlay procedure than with the streak or pour overlay method and the shake flask assay. The modified overlay distinguished between antibiotic production and other antagonistic effects. The inhibitory agents extracted after 6 days of culture growth on the modified <b>overlay</b> <b>agar</b> were of a higher concentration and more stable over {{longer periods of time}} than those recovered from shake flasks. It was observed that acidoduric streptomyces produced a greater proportion of antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria than did neutrophilic cultures, and this effect was greatest with the isolates from the most acidic soils. The neutrophiles were more active against gram-positive bacteria and, upon antibiotic classification, it appeared that the neutrophilic and acidoduric cultures from various soils produced different antimicrobial compounds...|$|E

As regards this study, EVs were quantified by the plaque assay method in confluent monolayers of BGM cells grown in cell culture plates (Bae and Schwab 2008). Briefly, EV plaque assays were conducted using confluent BGM cells; in 60 -mm dishes (cells cover the entire dish). Duplicate dishes were inoculated with 100  µl of a sample (concentrate) after rising aspirate plates with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Plates were incubated {{at room temperature for}} 1  h to allow virus adsorption to the cells., with gentle rocking every 15  min. Five milliliters of <b>overlay</b> <b>agar</b> (Difco, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) containing Minimum Essential Medium and 2  % of a 3.3 -g/l stock solution of neutral red (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) was added to each dish after incubation.

Plaques were counted and the virus concentration in the original water sample was calculated from the analyzed volume and the virus count. The results are expressed as plaque forming units (PFUs) per 100  ml (PFU  100  m/l) (Smith and Gerba 1982; Mocé-Llivina et al. 2004).|$|E
40|$|Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O 157 (O 157) is {{infectious}} to humans, particularly children, at {{very low}} doses and causes not only haemorrhagic colitis but also other serious symptoms. To investigate an association between intestinal bacterial flora and resistance to such infections, we screened faecal samples {{for the presence of}} enteric bacteria that are able to suppress the growth of O 157. Samples from 303 individuals, 35 children (aged ⩽ 6 years) and 268 adults (aged 20 – 59 years), were examined. Colonies with different appearances on sorbitol MacConkey agar medium were screened for the production of bacteriocins inhibitory for O 157 in an <b>overlay</b> <b>agar</b> plate assay. O 157 -inhibiting strains were isolated from 52 individuals. The prevalence of these bacteria tended to rise with age, and was significantly higher among 40 - to 59 -year-old adults (23 / 101, 22 · 8 %) than among children (3 / 35, 8 · 6 %; P< 0 · 05). To test the hypothesis that these bacteriocin-producing strains contribute to resistance against O 157 in human adults, we examined faecal samples of 25 healthy O 157 carriers. Inhibitory bacteria were more prevalent among the latter (9 / 25, 36 · 0 %) than among age-matched subjects who did not carry O 157 (49 / 268, 18 · 3 %).

When 21 samples of fresh ground beef were studied and plate count agar counts were used as references, we obtained a mean recovery of 28 % of total counts with violet red bile <b>agar</b> <b>overlay,</b> whereas we obtained 48 % recovery with PBAC agar. With 12 samples of frozen ground beef, recovery on violet red bile <b>agar</b> <b>overlay</b> was 29 % of the recovery on plate count agar, whereas the corresponding value on PBAC agar was 45 %.

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Salmonella Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes {{are common}} {{foodborne}} pathogens in the United States. With {{the advent of}} more consumers seeking chemical-free treatments to control pathogenic organisms in food, {{there has been an}} increasing interest in antimicrobials from natural sources. This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of lime juice and java plum juice on aforementioned foodborne pathogenic bacteria in microbiological media and food models. First, agar well diffusion assay was conducted to test if the juices were effective against the four bacteria. After confirming its effectiveness, the antimicrobial activity of diluted lime juice was further confirmed in water and nutrient broth inoculated with the pathogenic bacteria. The survival of the bacteria in water and nutrient broth was determined on plate count agar (PCA). S. Typhimurium, S. aureus, and L. monocytogenes in water supplemented with 50 % lime juice were inactivated at room temperature within 3, 8, and 48 h, respectively. Inactivation of the pathogens was faster in nutrient broth incubated at 35 °C than in water. Nutrient broth supplemented with 50 % java plum juice inactivated S. Typhimurium and S. aureus in 12 h, and E. coli O 157 :H 7 and L. monocytogenes in 24 h. The juices were then tested on food models such as shrimp and cut cantaloupe. The pathogenic bacteria on the foods were enumerated on selective agars, with xylose lysine decarboxylase (XLD) agar for S. Typhimurium and modified Oxford (MOX) agar for L. monocytogenes. The <b>overlay</b> <b>agar</b> method was also employed to recover the injured cells on PCA before enumerating on the selective agars. S. Typhimurium was used as a representative pathogen to test its susceptibility to lime juice on shrimp. S. Typhimurium-inoculated shrimps were marinated in diluted lime juice at 7 °C for 0, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h. By 24 h, a significant difference (P< 0. 05) between the 25 % treatment and control started to show. Comparing to the control, the 50 % treatment reduced the count of S. Typhimurium on shrimp by 2. 07, and 3. 34 logs at 24 h, and 48 h, respectively. S. Typhimurium and L. monocytogenes, the two pathogens that have caused several multistate foodborne illness outbreaks with cantaloupe, were tested for their susceptibility to java plum juice treatments on the fruit. After dipping the inoculated cantaloupe cubes in diluted java plum juice for an hour, the fruit was stored at 7 °C for 8 days. Under refrigeration, both L. monocytogenes and S. Typhimurium were able to grow on cut cantaloupe. When the fruit was treated with 50 % java plum juice, the growth of L. monocytogenes was restrained. Comparing to the control, the 50 % treatment significantly reduced the count of S. Typhimurium by 0. 67, 2. 86, and 3. 41 logs on day 0, day 4 and day 8, respectively. The results from the selective agar and <b>overlay</b> <b>agar</b> were significantly different for S. Typhimurium counts in both solid food models although counts for L. monocytogenes showed {{no significant difference between the}} two agars. This indicates that the use of overlay method is crucial for the enumeration of S. Typhimurium when the cells are injured due to exposure to lime juice and java plum juice...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{method of}} using fluorescein-labeled antibody {{for the detection}} of polysaccharide, protein, and teichoic acid antigens synthesized by streptococcal colonies on an agar surface is described. The bacteria were grown on the surface of an agar medium contained in the shallow well of an immunodiffusion slide. An agar overlay containing the fluorescein antiserum was dispensed over the colonies, excess antiserum was washed out of the <b>overlay</b> <b>agar,</b> and the fluorescent colonies were observed under an ultraviolet microscope. The shallow well in the immunodiffusion slide prevented the agar from floating loose during washing, and the agar overlay prevented the fragmentation and loss of colonies. The thin layer of agar facilitated microscopic examination and the counting of fluorescent and nonfluorescent colonies. Colonies producing an antigen against which the antiserum was directed could readily be distinguished from colonies not producing the antigen. The specificity of the method was shown by using mixtures of streptococci representing six serological groups and five types. Those not known to possess cross-reacting antigens were specific in their reaction to the fluorescein antibody. Cross-reactions between the group antigens of A, C, and G, as reported previously by fluorescent staining of streptococcal suspensions, were also seen. Group A colonies reacted weakly with fluorescent E antibody and vice versa. The extraction of this antigen with cold trichloroacetic acid indicates it was related to the teichoic acids. Colonies possessing polysaccharide, protein, and teichoic acid antigens gave equally strong fluorescent reactions. This procedure permits detection of the synthesis of antigen which could not be observed by the use of a selective medium; it also eliminates the necessity for subculture of each colony and testing by appropriate serological means. Such a technique has value for studies in classification and biochemical genetics, and should be applicable to other genera of bacteria...|$|E

Methods: Subgingival plaque samples from 35 patients (healthy and periodontitis patients), were analyzed. Growth inhibition of the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was examined using the <b>agar</b> <b>overlay</b> technique and <b>agar</b> well diffusion method. The quantification of the inhibitory effect was checked with the agar well diffusion method. Results: Using the <b>agar</b> <b>overlay</b> technique the prevalence of strains antagonistic towards P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum was found to be higher in healthy individuals than in individuals suffering from periodontitis, this could not be validated by the agar well diffusion assay.

The signifi-cance of these results {{to an understanding of the}} kinetics of focus formation by MSV is discussed. -J Nat Cancer Inst 46 : 1001 - 1007, 1971. THE FORMATION of focal areas of morpho-logically altered cells in tissue culture by infection with murine sarcoma virus (MSV) differs in the mouse and rat cell culture systems. In mouse embryo cells, murine leukemia virus (MLV) is required as "helper, " but in rat cells focus forma-tion can occur without MLV (1). To facilitate the selection and study of foci induced in both mouse and rat cells and to minimize spread of newly formed virus, an <b>agar</b> <b>overlay</b> method has been developed. Although hard <b>agar</b> <b>overlays</b> have been used for both the avian and murine systems (2 - 4), results with hard agar in our laboratory have been inconsistent. This communication describes the successful selection of MSV foci formed in mouse and rat cells maintained under a soft ionagar overlay. The characteristics of individual foci were studied particularly in reference to virus progeny production and cell growth potential...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of 17 commercially available tampons on production of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST- 1) by Staphylococcus aureus was investigated {{by using a}} tampon disk method. Filter membranes <b>overlaying</b> <b>agar</b> medium (with or without blood) in small petri dishes were spread inoculated with a TSST- 1 -producing strain of S. aureus. Disks cut from unrolled tampons were pressed and laid on the inoculated membranes; incubation was for 19 h at 37 degrees C with 5 % CO 2 in air. CFU on the membranes and in the disks were enumerated, {{and the presence of}} TSST- 1 in the disks and in the agar layers was determined. Tampons made of different materials supported characteristic levels of cell growth and toxin production in the tampon. Colonization of the interface surface of the tampon disks was heavy. The number of CFU extracted from the tampon disks ranged from 5 X 10 (10) to 82 X 10 (10). There was little variation in the CFU recovered from the membranes ([1. 9 +/- 0. 4] X 10 (11)). Sixty to 170 micrograms of TSST- 1 was recoverable from the agar, with an additional 10 to 90 micrograms recoverable from tampon disks, {{depending on the type of}} tampon disk. The amount of toxin in the agar layer from the various tampon disks was relatively constant and indicated an important contribution of toxin from vaginal S. aureus cells not growing in the tampon. The main role of tampons in toxic shock syndrome may be that of providing a fibrous surface for heavy colonization and sufficient air for TSST- 1 production...|$|R

Several uvrC mutations were obtained which were suppressor sensitive...|$|R

Plaques were produced in 3 days when chymotrypsin {{was included in}} a serum-free fluid overlay. Plaques were also produced in 5 to 6 days under an <b>agar</b> <b>overlay</b> when a medium containing fetal calf serum was employed. Kinetics of plaque formation were also studied, and it was shown that fowlpox virus plaque diameters grow at a linear rate...|$|R
40|$|Plaque {{production}} by a small-plaque (SP) and large-plaque (LP) variant of foot-and-mouth disease virus, type A, strain 119 (FMDV, A 119), {{was influenced by}} a number of environmental factors. The SP variant produced plaques on cells of the IB-RS- 2 cell line from swine kidney and to a lesser degree on primary cultures of swine kidney cells, but plaque formation was inhibited on primary cultures of bovine kidney (BK) cells unless diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) dextran was added to <b>agar</b> <b>overlays.</b> When DEAE dextran-treated <b>agar</b> <b>overlay</b> was used, the LP variant formed larger plaques on BK cells but not on IB-RS- 2 cells. Concentrations of DEAE dextran from 0 to 100 µg/ml greatly enhanced the formation of SP virus plaques on BK cells but had little or no effect on the average size of plaques produced by the LP variant. Higher concentrations of polycation enlarged the plaques formed by both variants. Plaque sizes of the SP and LP variants increased as the concentration of agar or agarose in the overlays decreased. Reducing the concentration of agar to 0. 75 % facilitated the formation of SP virus plaques, but better plaque production occurred under agarose overlays...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{compare the}} {{biocompatibility}} and antimicrobial {{effectiveness of the}} new Fast-Set MTA (FS-MTA) with ProRoot MTA (RS-MTA). Methods. The <b>agar</b> <b>overlay</b> method with neutral red dye was used. L 929 mouse fibroblast cells were cultured. The liquid and oil extracts and solid test material {{were placed on the}} <b>agar</b> <b>overlay,</b> four samples for each material. Phenol was used as the positive control and cottonseed oil and MEM extracts were used as negative controls. Cytotoxicity was examined by measuring the zones of decolorization and evaluating cell lysis under an inverted microscope using the established criteria after 24 and 48 hours. The antimicrobial test was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disk-diffusion method against S. mutans, E. faecalis, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, and P. intermedia. The size of the zone of inhibition was measured in millimeters. Results. There was no zone of decolorization seen under or around the test materials for FS-MTA and RS-MTA at 24 and 48 hours. The antimicrobial test demonstrated no inhibitory effect of FS-MTA or RS-MTA on any bacterial species after 24 and 48 hours. Conclusions. There was no cytotoxicity or bacterial inhibition observed by the new Fast-Set MTA when compared to the ProRoot MTA after setting...|$|R
