25|$|The French {{remained}} at anchor {{in front of}} Muros when the fleet of the Marquis of Viso came over to them at full speed. He only had 16 ships, which were all that he could enlist and equip, but were, apparently, the largest available at the time, giving him a certain advantage over the 25 French ships. As it was 25 July, the Festivity of St. James, Patrón de España, Bazán harangued his troops {{by pointing out that}} it was impossible for the Spanish to lose a battle <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day.</b> The Spanish troops attacked with such a raging fervour, that the French, were overwhelmed in a short time.|$|E
25|$|On 25 April 2012, {{to commemorate}} ANZAC Day, Breakfast {{commenced}} at 5am and finished at 11.30am, replacing The Project (encore) and The Circle.

25|$|When {{he reached}} puberty, Dahmer {{discovered}} that he was homosexual. He did not divulge his sexual orientation to his parents, although in his early teens, he did engage in a brief relationship with another youth, although the pair never had intercourse. By his later admission, {{as he began to}} fantasize sexually, issues of dominance and control over a completely subservient partner were prevalent in his thoughts. These thoughts gradually became intertwined with dissection. On one occasion, when he was approximately 16 years old, Dahmer conceived a rape fantasy of rendering a particular male jogger he found attractive unconscious and then making sexual use of his unconscious body. To render the man unconscious, Dahmer concealed himself in bushes on the route he had noted the jogger took, baseball bat in hand, and lay in wait for the jogger. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day,</b> the jogger did not pass him and, although Dahmer never attempted to implement this plan again, he later stated this was his first attempt to attack another individual.|$|E

50|$|As {{the dance}} is {{performed}} on the feast-day of Saint Roch, who is traditionally invoked in times of plague, some experts argue that survivors of the plague in Pont-de-Cervières would have chosen this Saint as patron of their district. However, {{there has never been}} any mention of a vow being made to perform a special dance <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> saint's <b>day.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day</b> was {{proposed}} by Valentin Balt and Michael Cherviakov, employees of Parallel Technologies (a software company).

60|$|<b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day,</b> {{however, the}} cashier was silent and absent-minded. He {{answered}} Mike's good-morning mechanically, and {{sitting down at}} his desk, stared blankly across the building. There was a curiously grey, tired look on his face.|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{proclamation}} was essentially to thank God for America's good fortune in the Revolutionary War. This did not {{form the basis for}} Thanksgiving Day as it is known presently in the United States. Congressional and presidential declarations named several days of thanks each year throughout the Revolutionary War period and after. <b>This</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day</b> of thanks falls on November 28.|$|R
50|$|On 22 August 1962, Charles de Gaulle was {{the victim}} of an {{attempted}} assassination at Petit-Clamart. He later said that the potentially fatal bullet had been stopped by the frame of the photograph of Anne that he always carried with him, placed <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day</b> <b>on</b> the rear shelf of his car. When he died in 1970, he was buried in the cemetery of Colombey beside his beloved daughter.|$|R
60|$|<b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day,</b> however, Mr. Roscommon {{was not in}} {{his usual}} spirits, and when the clatter of horses' hoofs before the door {{announced}} the approach of strangers, he absolutely ceased wiping his counter and looked up as Dr. Guild, the President, and Secretary of the new Company strode into the shop.|$|E
60|$|The {{doctor has}} {{just left the}} house, in some little perplexity about me. He has found me {{reclining}} as usual (latterly) in my arm-chair; but <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day</b> he has detected symptoms of exhaustion, which he finds quite unaccountable under the circumstances, and which warn him to exert his authority by sending {{me back to my}} bed.|$|E
60|$|<b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day</b> {{there was}} dissension in the camp. They {{had just been}} convicted afresh of smoking, which is bad for little boys who use plug-tobacco, and Lew's {{contention}} was that Jakin had 'stunk so 'orrid bad from keepin' the pipe in pocket,' that he and he alone {{was responsible for the}} birching they were both tingling under.|$|E
60|$|Although the Duncans dined in the evening, the Merrills {{had dinner}} at half-past {{one in the}} afternoon, when the girls {{returned}} from school. Mr. Merrill usually came home, but he had gone off somewhere for <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day,</b> and Mrs. Merrill had a sewing circle. The girls sat down to dinner alone. When they {{got up from the}} table, Susan suddenly remembered the note which she had left in her coat pocket. She drew out the clippings with it.|$|R
5000|$|<b>This</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day,</b> she {{promises}} {{that she will}} end the suffering of her suitors and decide on her next lover, announcing that whoever can touch her heart the most deeply with a song will win her. The Count sings [...] "In einem Lande ein bleicher König," [...] a sad but beautiful song, which the crowd applauds. The Chevalier counters with [...] "Das Blumenmädchen von Sorrent," [...] a bawdy song that the crowd enjoys as they noisily join in the singing.|$|R

6000|$|Then {{the thing}} happened. A little thing, {{it could only}} be traced back to first causes: perhaps the lieutenant's breakfast had not agreed with him; or he had been up late the night before; or his debts were pressing; or the {{commander}} had spoken brusquely to him. The point is, that <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day</b> the lieutenant was irritable. The sailor, with others, was [...] "setting up" [...] the fore rigging.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Gascoigne {{felt that}} he had come to a {{satisfactory}} understanding with his niece, and had furthered her happy settlement in life by furthering her engagement to Grandcourt. Meanwhile there was another person to whom the contemplation of that issue had been a motive for some activity, and who believed that he, too, <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day</b> had done something toward bringing about a favorable decision in his sense--which happened to be the reverse of the rector's.|$|E

[...] "The obstinacy of {{my whole}} sex," [...] it seems, was {{concentrated}} in me; I had an [...] "orgueil de diable." [...] I feared to fail, forsooth! What {{did it matter}} whether I failed or not? Who was I that I should not fail, like my betters? It would do me good to fail. He {{wanted to see me}} worsted (I knew he did), and one minute he paused to take breath.|$|E
60|$|Jim Frost {{deserved}} all {{the praise}} that the enthusiastic boy bestowed on him, for, besides possessing a fine ear and taste for music, and having taught himself to play well, {{he had a}} magnificent tenor voice, and took great delight in singing the beautiful hymns which at that time had been introduced to the fleet. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day</b> he was joined by his crew, whose voices--more or less tuneful--came rolling over {{the water in a}} great volume of melody.|$|E
60|$|Returning home <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day</b> of days, I paused {{upon the}} bridge, and watched for awhile the lazy barges {{manoeuvring}} their way between the piers. It {{was one of}} those hushed summer evenings when the air even of grim cities is full of whispering voices; and as, turning away from the river, I passed through the white toll-gate, I had a sense of leaving myself behind me on the bridge. So vivid was the impression, that I looked back, half expecting to see myself still leaning over the iron parapet, looking down into the sunlit water.|$|E

I would give my soul for that!" ...|$|R
60|$|And my {{explanation}} came in this way. I {{had suffered}} a sleepless night from neuralgia, and about midday I had taken {{a heavy dose of}} chlorodyne to alleviate the pain. At that time I was finishing the indexing of Sir John Bollamore's library, and it was my custom to work there from five till seven. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day</b> I struggled against the double effect of my bad night and the narcotic. I have already mentioned that there was a recess in the library, and in this it was my habit to work. I settled down steadily to my task, but my weariness overcame me and, falling back upon the settee, I dropped into a heavy sleep.|$|E
6000|$|One {{day while}} out {{shooting}} with the colonel, {{with whom he}} was {{doing his best to}} ingratiate himself, with a view to obtaining his consent to the match, he had allowed his sporting instincts to carry him away to such a degree that, in sporting parlance, he wiped his eye badly. Now, the colonel prided himself with justice on his powers as a shot; but <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day</b> he had a touch of liver, which resulted in his shooting over the birds, and under the birds, and {{on each side of the}} birds, but very rarely at the birds. Dallas being in especially good form, it was found, when the bag came to be counted, that, while he had shot seventy brace, the colonel had only managed to secure five and a half! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day,</b> {{snow had}} begun to fall early in the morning, and, while his pupils would have been only too delighted {{to go out and}} roll in it by the hour, they were {{prevented}} from doing so by Mr Abney's strict orders. No schoolmaster enjoys seeing his pupils running risks of catching cold, and just then Mr Abney was especially definite on the subject. The Saturnalia which had followed Mr MacGinnis' nocturnal visit to the school had had the effect of giving violent colds to three lords, a baronet, and the younger son of an honourable. And, in addition to that, Mr Abney himself, his penetrating tenor changed to a guttural croak, was in his bed looking on the world with watering eyes. His views, therefore, on playing in the snow as an occupation for boys were naturally prejudiced.|$|E
