500|$|Some {{linguists}} {{and philosophers}} of language have criticized Fodor's self-proclaimed [...] "extreme" [...] concept nativism. Kent Bach, for example, takes Fodor {{to task for}} his criticisms of lexical semantics and polysemy. Fodor claims {{that there is no}} lexical structure to such verbs as [...] "keep", [...] "get", [...] "make" [...] and [...] "put". He suggests that, alternatively, [...] "keep" [...] simply expresses the concept KEEP (Fodor capitalizes concepts to distinguish them from properties, names or other such entities). If there is a straightforward <b>one-to-one</b> <b>mapping</b> between individual words and concepts, [...] "keep your clothes on", [...] "keep your receipt" [...] and [...] "keep washing your hands" [...] will all share the same concept of KEEP under Fodor's theory. This concept presumably locks on to the unique external property of keeping. But, if this is true, then RETAIN must pick out a different property in RETAIN YOUR RECEIPT, since one can't retain one's clothes on or retain washing one's hands. Fodor's theory also has a problem explaining how the concept FAST contributes, differently, to the contents of FAST CAR, FAST DRIVER, FAST TRACK, and FAST TIME. Whether or not the differing interpretations of [...] "fast" [...] in these sentences are specified in the semantics of English, or are the result of pragmatic inference, is a matter of debate. Fodor's own response to this kind of criticism is expressed bluntly in Concepts: [...] "People sometimes used to say that exist must be ambiguous because look at the difference between 'chairs exist' and 'numbers exist'. A familiar reply goes: the difference between the existence of chairs and the existence of numbers seems, on reflection, strikingly like the difference between numbers and chairs. Since you have the latter to explain the former, you don't also need 'exist' to be polysemic." ...|$|E

They studied infants {{at this age}} because this is when the heuristic {{has been shown to}} appear in monolingual infants. Additionally, they studied bilinguals from multiple diverse language backgrounds to show that the patterns were not language-specific but rather characteristic of bilingualism in general. they found that monolinguals showed disambiguation, bilinguals somewhat, and trilinguals did not. Byers‐Heinlein & Werker (2009) hypothesized that this was particularly an effect of translation equivalents (knowing the name for something in more than one language), as [...] "they represent a departure from the <b>one-to-one</b> <b>mapping</b> between word and concept that is typical of monolingual vocabularies" [...] (p 820). Indeed, in a later study conducted by Byers-Heinlein & Werker (2013) in 17–18 month-old Chinese-English bilingual infants, results showed that disambiguation did not occur in the infants who [...] "understood the translation equivalents {{for more than half of}} the words in their vocabularies" [...] (p.407), while disambiguation occurred in those who knew fewer translation equivalents. They also suggested that the reverse could be possible—that infants who employed the heuristic were the ones that did acquire the translation equivalents because of the high level of <b>one-to-one</b> <b>mapping.</b> also say that disambiguation and language exposure are not correlated, but the presence or absence of translation equivalents could be attributed by the amount of exposure in each language the child gets. Particularly, if children receive more exposure in both languages, they are likely to have both words for a given object or concept, but if they have less exposure in one language they will likely lack the appropriate amount of translation equivalents, thereby exhibiting disambiguation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In 1995 J. W. Heath {{asked which}} exactly n-to-one maps are {{compositions}} of exactly k-to-one maps with 1 <k<n. This paper deals with compositions of covering maps. Exactly n-to-one covering maps on locally arcwise connected continua {{that are not}} factorable into covering maps of order ≤ n − 1 are constructed for all n’s, and characterized in algebraic terms (fundamental groups). They are not proper compositions of exactly k-to-one maps, open <b>maps,</b> or locally <b>one-to-one</b> <b>maps.</b> A (continuous) map {{is said to be}} of order ≤ n when each of its point-inverses has at most n points. Maps of order ≤ 2 are called simple. Let us recall the following three problems from the literature—each of them concerns maps between compact metric spaces. Problem A (K. Borsuk, R. Molski [2]). Is every locally <b>one-to-one</b> <b>map</b> a composition of a finite number of simple locally <b>one-to-one</b> <b>maps?</b> 1 Problem B (J. D. Baildon [1]). Is every open map of order ≤ n defined on a finitedimensional space necessarily a finite composition of simple open maps? Problem C (J. W. Heath [6]). Under what circumstances are exactly n-to-one maps finite compositions of maps of lesser order? 2 J. Dydak [3] showed that if p is prime, then the map z ↦ → z p of the unit complex circle is not factorable into locally <b>one-to-one</b> <b>maps</b> of order ≤ p − 1. These same maps z ↦ → z p are not compositions of simple open maps (Baildon [1]). On the other hand, both Problems A and B have affirmative answers in the case of maps from zero-dimensional spaces 3. Problem C was considered by L. R. Griffus [4]. Lastly, let us mention that exactly four-to-one maps from the interval [0, 1] are not factorabl...|$|R

The result of this representation will automatically be a binary tree, if viewed from a different perspective. Each node N in the ordered tree corresponds to a node N' [...] in the binary tree; the left child of N' [...] is the node corresponding to the first child of N, and the right child of N' [...] is the node corresponding to N 's next sibling --- that is, the next node in order among {{the children of the}} parent of N.

The former space, of -vectors, has dimension , while the latter has dimension , which are equal by the symmetry of the binomial coefficients. Equal-dimensional vector spaces are always isomorphic, but not necessarily in a natural or canonical way. In this case, however, Hodge duality exploits the nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form, hereafter {{referred to as the}} inner product (though it might not be positive definite), and a choice of orientation to single out a unique isomorphism, which parallels the combinatorial symmetry of binomial coefficients. This in turn induces an inner product on the space of -vectors. The naturalness of this definition means the duality can play a role in differential geometry.|$|E
