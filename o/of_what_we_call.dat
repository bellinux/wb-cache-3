25|$|Yes, I suppose. The {{violence}} {{served a}} therapeutic purpose. It's unsettling {{to think that}} at any moment life can flare up into senseless violence. But it can and does, and {{people need to be}} ready for it. What you make for others is first of all what you make for yourself. If I’m persuaded that our life is predicated upon violence, that the entire structure <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> civilization, the scaffolding that we’ve built up over the millennia, can collapse at any moment, then whatever I write is going to be affected by that assumption. The process of life presupposes violence, in the plant world the same as the animal world. But among the animals only man can conceptualize violence. Only man can enjoy the idea of destruction.|$|E
500|$|The year 2002 {{marked a}} high point in Moore's career, as she became [...] the ninth {{performer}} to be nominated for two Academy Awards in the same year. She received a Best Actress nomination for the melodrama Far from Heaven, in which she played a 1950s housewife whose world is shaken when her husband reveals he is gay. The role was written specifically for her by Todd Haynes, {{the first time the}} pair had worked together since Safe, and Moore described it as [...] "a very, very personal project... such an incredible honor to do." [...] David Rooney of Variety praised her [...] "beautifully gauged performance" [...] of a desperate woman [...] "buckling under social pressures and putting on a brave face". Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "what Moore does with her role is so beyond the parameters <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> great acting that it nearly defies categorization." [...] The role won Moore the Best Actress award from 19 different organizations, including the Venice Film Festival and the National Board of Review.|$|E

500|$|In late 2010, TV Tonight {{reported}} that Neighbours would reduce crew operations in 2011 so production could be upgraded. The changes {{meant that the}} location manager and catering team were no longer required, studio shoots would be reduced from three cameras to two, and location shots will be mainly confined to the Ramsay Street and Lassiter's complex sets, with occasional filming in one-off places. Of the changes, FremantleMedia said [...] "Neighbours is undergoing a work flow upgrade to accommodate advances in technology and production techniques to ensure {{we are at the}} forefront of professionalism and efficiency." [...] They added that the show's production model had been in place since 1985 and {{that it was time to}} evolve it. On 14 March 2011, The Australian {{reported that}} Neighbours has become the first television show available to watch on a free iPhone application. Viewers are able to watch whole episodes within three hours of them airing on Eleven. Nick Spooner, the head of Ten digital media said [...] "This is part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> our 'three-screen approach' – broadcast, online and mobile – and it is intended to build viewer engagement with a show and our brand. This is a way for us to stay in touch with our audience and to keep them coming back." [...] To celebrate the wedding of Prince William of Wales and Kate Middleton, Neighbours filmed a specially commissioned scene for the UK episode airing on the same day as the wedding. The episode, which had already aired in Australia, marked the first time an Australian show recorded extra scenes for a UK broadcaster.|$|E

But emotions and behaviors significantly influence and affect thinking, just as thinking influences emotions and behaviors. Evaluating is a fundamental characteristic of human organisms and seems {{to work in a}} kind of closed circuit with a feedback mechanism: First, perception biases response, and then response tends to bias subsequent perception. Also, prior perceptions appear to bias subsequent perceptions, and prior responses appear to bias subsequent responses.

2500|$|However {{materials}} {{in which all}} three refractive indices are different are termed biaxial and {{the origin of this}} term is more complicated and frequently misunderstood. In a uniaxial crystal, different polarization components of a beam will travel at different phase velocities, except for rays in the direction <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> the optic axis. Thus the optic axis has the particular property that rays in that direction do not exhibit birefringence, with all polarizations in such a beam experiencing the same index of refraction. It is very different when the three principal refractive indices are all different; then an incoming ray in any of those principle directions will still encounter two different refractive indices. But it turns out that there are two special directions (at an angle to all of the 3 axes) where the refractive indices for different polarizations are again equal. For this reason, these crystals were designated as biaxial, with the two [...] "axes" [...] in this case referring to ray directions in which propagation does not experience birefringence.|$|E
2500|$|Slavophiles {{declared}} Tolstoy their [...] "" [...] {{and pronounced}} War and Peace [...] "the Bible {{of the new}} national idea". Several articles on War and Peace were published in 1869–70 in Zarya magazine by Nikolai Strakhov. [...] "War and Peace {{is the work of}} genius, equal to everything that the Russian literature has produced before", he pronounced in the first, smaller essay. [...] "It is now quite clear that from 1868 when the War and Peace was published the very essence <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> Russian literature has become quite different, acquired the new form and meaning", the critic continued later. Strakhov was the first critic in Russia who declared Tolstoy's novel to be a masterpiece of level previously unknown in Russian literature. Still, being a true Slavophile, he could not fail to see the novel as promoting the major Slavophiliac ideas of [...] "meek Russian character's supremacy over the rapacious European kind" [...] (using Apollon Grigoriev's formula). Years later, in 1878, discussing Strakhov's own book The World as a Whole, Tolstoy criticized both Grigoriev's concept (of [...] "Russian meekness vs. Western bestiality") and Strakhov's interpretation of it.|$|E
