40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the interaction between}} object- and space-based attention by measuring activity in early visual cortex. After central cueing, when subjects directed attention to a spatially defined part of an object, activity in early visual areas was enhanced at corresponding retinotopic representations but also at representations of other locations covered by the object. Different from the assumption of automatic attentional “spreading ” within an object, however, activity was greater for representations of cued than of uncued locations on the same object. These findings support an interaction of object-based spatial selection with object-independent spatial mechanisms in directing attention. When the target stimulus did not appear at the expected location, we found higher activation in areas representing other locations on the same object than equidistant locations on other objects. Objects, hence, also guide spatial search, and this {{may account for the}} behaviorally observed delay in processing parts of an unattended <b>object.</b> <b>Key</b> words: visuospatial attention; object-based attention; visual cortex; retinotopy; fMRI; top-down modulatio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Large Binocular Telescope (LBT), {{which will}} be {{available}} in a few years from now, has been designed for high-resolution optical/infrared imaging through coherent cophasing of the two mirrors. The structure of the process of image formation in LBT is similar to that in Computed Tomography (CT) so that it is interesting to investigate the applicability to LBT of image restoration methods developed for CT. A powerful one is the so-called Expectation Maximization (EM), which is also known in the astronomical litera-ture as Lucy-Richardson (LR) method. However slow convergence is a drawback of this method. In the case of CT an accelerated version, based on ordered subsets of projection data (OS-EM), has been proposed. In this paper we adapt OS-EM to the problem of restoring LBT images and we show that it provides an acceleration by a factor which is roughly equal to the number of independent interferometric images of the same <b>object.</b> <b>Key</b> words: image processing, data analysis 1...|$|E

A high resolving power (R≃ 10, 000) spectrum was obtained with the infrared spectrometer ISAAC mounted on VLT − ANT U. Modeling of the profile suggests that the hot (Tgas = 2000 – 4000 K) and dense (nH> 10 10 cm − 3) molecular material as probed by the CO bandhead {{is located in the}} inner AU of a Keplerian disk viewed almost edge-on. Combined with the observation of cooler gas (Tgas = 500 - 900 K) by ISO-SWS and the lack of cold material, our data suggest that the disk around 51 Oph is essentially warm and small. We demonstrate the presence of a dust-free inner disk that extents from the inner truncation radius until the dust sublimation radius.
