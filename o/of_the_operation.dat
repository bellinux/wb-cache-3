5|$|Accounts of {{the final}} {{termination}} of the coup attempt vary between historians. Gleijeses stated that while the freighter {{was on its way}} to Nicaragua, a CIA employee went to Miller, and asked him to sign a document on behalf of the munitions department. Miller refused, and instead showed the document to his superiors, who in turn informed Dean Acheson. Gleijeses writes that Acheson immediately spoke to Truman as a result of this document, and the operation was cut short. Nick Cullather writes that due to Somoza spreading the word about the coup, the State Department decided that the cover <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> had been lost. Other diplomats began to learn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation,</b> and on 8 October Dean Acheson summoned Smith and called off the operation.|$|E
5|$|After Lavasani's {{body had}} been recovered, Sir David McNee, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, {{contacted}} the Home Secretary to request approval to hand control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> over to the British Army, under the provisions of Military Aid to the Civil Power. Whitelaw relayed the request to Thatcher, {{and the prime minister}} agreed immediately. Thus John Dellow, the ranking police officer at the embassy, signed over control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> to Lieutenant Colonel Mike Rose at 19:07, authorising Rose to order an assault at his discretion. Meanwhile, the police negotiators began stalling Oan. They offered concessions in order to distract him and prevent him killing further hostages, buying time for the SAS to make its final preparations for the now-inevitable assault.|$|E
