Yet somehow Lord Arthur was not happy. Every day he studied the <b>obituary</b> <b>column</b> in the Times, expecting to see a notice of Lady Clementina's death, but every day he was disappointed. He began to be afraid that some accident had happened to her, and often regretted that he had prevented her taking the aconitine when she had been so anxious to try its effect. Sybil's letters, too, though full of love, and trust, and tenderness, were often very sad in their tone, and sometimes he used to think that he was parted from her for ever.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{obituary}} pages of quality newspapers {{attempt to be}} purveyors of instant and authoritative biography, offering unfettered accounts of lives lived, they demonstrate some haphazard practice in recording their subjects' sexual persuasion. That intermittent unreliability has been the topic of critical comment in the gay media, particularly when obituaries have failed to recognise the existence of same-sex partners. This research paper, through an impressionistic sampling of British, American, and Australian <b>obituary</b> <b>columns,</b> finds evidence of a gradual shift towards candid posthumous character study, but points also to episodes of erratic rendition, especially in indicating sexual inclination within that process. It argues that the legitimacy of {{the obituary}} as an instrument of historical record is compromised accordingly. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. Although general {{practitioners}} {{are involved in}} the care of most dying patients, they do not routinely receive information about their deceased patients for whom they did not complete the death certificate, and often they rely upon informal communication channels. AIM. This study set out to assess how general practitioners obtained, recorded and used information about deceased patients and to determine their views on receiving a death register. METHOD. A questionnaire was sent to all 305 general practitioners in the Newcastle upon Tyne and Sunderland Family Health Services Authority areas. RESULTS. A total of 225 questionnaires were returned (response rate 74 %). General practitioners usually first learnt about their patients' deaths from hospital discharge summaries (54 %) and patients' relatives (46 %) and less commonly from newspaper <b>obituary</b> <b>columns</b> (20 %) and hospital telephone calls (9 %). Two thirds of respondents recorded information about decreased patients, mainly listing personal details and the immediate cause of death. One third or fewer of those recording information listed contributory causes. The information was used mainly for following up bereaved relatives and notifying hospitals and other agencies. CONCLUSION. Current informal systems for handling information about patients' deaths are inadequate. General practitioners need and would welcome prompt, accurate and comprehensive information about all their deceased patients...|$|R

5000|$|The Indian Press {{currently}} enjoys extensive freedom. The Freedom Of Speech, {{mandated by}} the constitution guarantees and safeguards the freedom of press. However, the freedom of press was not always as robust as today. In 1975, the Indira Gandhi government imposed censorship of press during The Emergency.

With the liberalisation starting in the 1990s, private control of media has increased, leading to increasing independence and greater scrutiny of government.Organisations like Tehelka and NDTV have been particularly influential, e.g. in bringing about the resignation of powerful Haryana minister Venod Sharma. In addition, laws like Prasar Bharati act passed in recent years contribute significantly to reducing the control of the press by the government.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} explored through intensive {{case studies}} the coping progress {{of a group}} of Jewish individuals and also recorded the areas in which they simultaneously observed the Jewish religious mourning rituals. The in-depth interviews of fiver persons, three women and two men, and selections from two additional interviews have been recorded. Their losses included both parents and both spouses. They were invited by the researcher when reports of their losses appeared in the newspaper <b>obituary</b> <b>columns.</b> Each subject was personally interviewed three times to coincide with the three stages of the Jewish ritual practice. ^ The questionnaires utilized to evaluate the subjects 2 ̆ 7 grief and coping were based upon questions developed in three previous studies: (a) The study of the Attachment Theory and Multiple Dimensions of Grief by Selby C. Jacobs, et al. (1986) of the Department of Psychiatry at Yale University. (b) The Expanded Texas Inventory of Grief developed by Sidney Zisook, et al. (1982). (c) The Center of Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. The questionnaires to determine the areas of the subjects 2 ̆ 7 observance or non-observance, of the Jewish ritual system were developed by this researcher. ^ The {{purpose of this study was}} to provide the two parallel records of grief coping and structured mourning procedure observance so that future researchers might have a basis for determining the influence of the latter on the former. An additional result is that in all cases the subjects themselves commented on what, if anything, observing the ritual meant to them. A further area of future study could, therefore, be to determine how one 2 ̆ 7 s own perception of the ritual one is observing determines the effect it has upon one 2 ̆ 7 s grief coping. ^ In the Summary and Recommendations observations are made on the efficacy of the questionnaire instruments employed in the studies mentioned above.

[...] The players wanted three dollars for each training session instead of one dollar, and a basic forty dollars per match until fifty games with increments coming each twenty-five games after that. [...] When their request was rejected they all decided to stand out of football. Essendon had initiated a move in the League for an increase in players' payments and advised the players that consideration of their request would be given when the League finally made a decision. The Essendon committee was unanimously in favour of the increase but under League regulations were not allowed to give it. [...] This was conveyed to the players who then advised the committee that unless their demands were met, the players of the 1969 list would in sympathy refuse to play in a practice match against South Adelaide. [...] After further discussions, the players decided to play, but, in a later letter, the five senior players submitted their retirement as players. They were not considered for the first match against Carlton. [...] During a sensational five hours at Essendon on Thursday the 2nd of April, the club threatened to split wide open. The five rebels turned up for training but were not invited to the players' dinner. As well, the club named a new acting captain, John Williams and acting vice-captain, Charlie Payne. [...] Chairman of selectors, Harry Hunter, when asked the reaction of the selectors said tersely:- [...] "You may need an <b>Obituary</b> <b>Column.</b> It could be the end of them." [...] But then four days later, the row was settled and the five were all chosen in the second game against Footscray. Davis became captain on the vote of the players and committee with McKenzie as his deputy. [...] The League, by this time, had agreed on an increased minimum payment to be allowed to be paid to players of thirty-five dollars and the players were advised of the increased payments. In addition, the Essendon committee decided to set up a testimonial fund, in addition to the regular player's provident fund, by which Essendon players would have an amount put aside for them to be collected on retirement only. [...] Alf Brown in The Herald was very critical of the treatment of the players. He wrote: [...] "Essendon have assets of $115,000 but claim they want this money to buy a new ground. They have been talking about shifting ever since I have been writing football ... The players have been treated like little school boys." [...] Club president Allan Hird, while admitting that Essendon could have afforded more, was understandably not prepared to break the League rules. He was particularly annoyed with one player who he refused to name, who he described as a [...] "paragon of virtue to the general public but the biggest disappointment." ...|$|E

Second, drawing from the both CDA and Systemic Functional Grammar (SFG), two of these obituaries, one closely matching the typical profile and one not, are subjected to a detailed analysis to compare and contrast them stylistically and to tease out the underlying ideology.

For {{over a decade}} now, commentators having been making similar observations about our obsession with the intimacies of individual people’s lives.

In this context and utilising best seller lists from the last century, this article examines and questions the commonly aired proposition that published life writing in its many text-based forms (biography, autobiography, memoir, diaries, and collections of personal letters) is enjoying a similar, and unprecedented, popularity...|$|E
