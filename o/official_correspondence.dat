5|$|Despite this, and at Godley's urging, {{a further}} attack was planned for 12 October, this time using the New Zealand Division and the Australian 3rd Division. By now {{the ground was}} a sea of mud {{and a lack of}} {{preparation}} on the part of Godley's corps headquarters hampered the preliminary movements of the attacking divisions and supporting artillery. Godley's plans for the attack were overly ambitious and beyond the scale of previous operations that had been mounted earlier in the month in better weather and ground conditions and with more time to prepare. The operation on 12 October proved to be a failure with limited gains and heavy losses in the attacking divisions. After the battle, Godley downplayed the losses in the New Zealand Division (which amounted to around 2,900 casualties) and overstated the gains made in <b>official</b> <b>correspondence</b> to Allen, and a friend, Clive Wigram, who was the assistant private secretary to King George V.|$|E
5|$|The Minister Steward (Shaofu 少府), {{also known}} as the Privy Treasurer and Small Treasurer, served the emperor exclusively, {{providing}} him with entertainment and amusements, proper food and clothing, medicine and physical care, valuables and equipment. For this purpose he was given responsibility for the emperor's personal finances during Western Han, yet this responsibility was transferred to the Minister of Finance during Eastern Han. Although he was not a castrated eunuch, many of his subordinates were, since his ministry managed the imperial harem housing concubines. His secretaries were headed by a Prefect of the Masters of Writing (Shangshu ling 尚書令). The secretaries were responsible for relaying all written messages to the emperor, <b>official</b> <b>correspondence</b> with Excellencies, senior ministers, provincial authorities, common people who submitted memorials to the throne, and non-Han-Chinese peoples within and outside the empire. Since the Masters of Writing were not eunuchs, and thus not allowed into the imperial harem, Emperor Wu established an all-eunuch office of secretaries for the inner palace, which was abolished in 29 BC.|$|E
5|$|With the war underway, Hancock {{made his}} way to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia with the other Massachusetts delegates. On May 24, 1775, he was {{unanimously}} elected President of the Continental Congress, succeeding Peyton Randolph after Henry Middleton declined the nomination. Hancock was a good choice for president for several reasons. He was experienced, having often presided over legislative bodies and town meetings in Massachusetts. His wealth and social standing inspired the confidence of moderate delegates, while his association with Boston radicals made him acceptable to other radicals. His position was somewhat ambiguous, because the role of the president was not fully defined, and it was not clear if Randolph had resigned or was on a leave of absence. Like other presidents of Congress, Hancock's authority was mostly limited to that of a presiding officer. He also had to handle a great deal of <b>official</b> <b>correspondence,</b> and he found it necessary to hire clerks at his own expense to help with the paperwork.|$|E

25|$|The force {{crossed the}} English Channel, {{landing on the}} Quiberon peninsula, where 2,500 men met them, giving Puisaye a total force of 6,000. The force relied on {{expected}} support from the peasants, {{but this was not}} forthcoming. The British recognised Puisaye as the commander of the force, but French royalist forces recognised the Comte d'Hervilly as the commander of the forces, and internal power struggles plagued the unit. With its leadership divided, the force did little, and republican forces attacked Puisaye's expedition while it was still on the peninsula, unready to fight. The royalists suffered defeat, with thousands of men drowning while trying to escape; those who surrendered were immediately executed. Puisaye escaped to England, claiming the need to save <b>official</b> <b>correspondence,</b> although he was accused of cowardice.|$|E
25|$|However, {{from the}} many {{thousands}} of papyri excavated from Oxyrhynchus, only about 10% were literary. The rest consisted {{of public and private}} documents: codes, edicts, registers, <b>official</b> <b>correspondence,</b> census-returns, tax-assessments, petitions, court-records, sales, leases, wills, bills, accounts, inventories, horoscopes, and private letters. Still, Grenfell and Hunt found enough texts of more general interest to keep them going in the hope of finding more. In their first year of digging alone, they found parts of several lost plays of Sophocles, such as the Ichneutae and many other books and fragments, including parts of what appeared to be an unknown Christian gospel. These discoveries captured the public imagination, and Grenfell and Hunt sent articles and photos to newspapers in Britain, arguing the importance of their work and seeking donations to keep it going.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{estimates}} put {{the population}} of the city between forty-thousand and fifty-thousand at the peak; in the early period, the inner city housed a third of that number. The dwelling houses that were built with timber and mud bricks have vanished from the site, leaving only the stone-built walls of temples and palaces. Excavations suggest that Hattusa was gradually abandoned {{over a period of several}} decades as the Hittite empire disintegrated. One of the most important discoveries at the site has been the cuneiform royal archives of clay tablets, consisting of <b>official</b> <b>correspondence</b> and contracts, as well as legal codes, procedures for cult ceremony, oracular prophecies and literature of the ancient near east. Although the thirty-thousand or so clay tablets recovered from Ḫattuša form the main corpus of Hittite literature, archives have since appeared at other centres in Anatolia, such as Tabigga and Sapinuwa.|$|E
25|$|A {{state of}} Lhomon (literally, {{southern}} darkness) or Monyul (dark land, {{a reference to}} the Monpa one of the Tibeto-Burman people of Bhutan), possibly a part of Tibet that was then beyond the pale of Buddhist teachings. Monyul is thought to have existed between AD 100 and AD 600. The names Lhomon Tsendenjong (southern Mon sandalwood country) and Lhomon Khashi (southern Mon country of four approaches), found in ancient Bhutanese and Tibetan chronicles, may also have credence and have been used by some Bhutanese scholars when referring to their homeland. Variations of the Sanskrit words Bhota-ant (end of Bhot) or Bhu-uttan (meaning highlands) have been suggested by historians as origins of the name Bhutan, which came into common foreign use in the late 19th century and is used in Bhutan only in English-language <b>official</b> <b>correspondence.</b> The traditional name of the country since the 17th century has been Drukyul—country of the Drukpa, the Dragon people, or the Land of the Thunder Dragon, {{a reference to the}} country's dominant Buddhist sect.|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to the study the ways of appropriation of land in the south border of Brazil, {{in the first half of}} the century XIX. The historiography has, for tradition, associated the appropriation of large tracts of land, in Rio Grande do Sul, with royal donations. That would have been made, mainly, in the form of 'sesmarias' donations. However, a more detained study shows than the public concessions were just one among other forms of appropriation of the land used by families that accomplished a voracious accumulation of lands. Among other sources, inventories post mortem, registrations of concessions of lands and <b>official</b> <b>correspondences</b> are used. The main analysis focus relapses on the municipal district of Alegrete, between 1800 and 187...|$|R

500|$|The ancient Egyptian model {{letters and}} epistles are grouped {{into a single}} {{literary}} genre.

One legend related to the national flag is attributed to the Buddhist priest Nichiren. Supposedly, during a 13th-century Mongolian invasion of Japan, Nichiren gave a sun banner to the shogun to carry into battle. The sun is also closely related to the Imperial family, as legend states the imperial throne was descended from the sun goddess Amaterasu.|$|E
