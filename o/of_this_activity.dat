5|$|As stated above, the hydrolytic {{proteins}} Rrp6 and Rrp44 {{are associated}} with the exosome in yeast and in humans, besides Rrp6, two different proteins, Dis3 and Dis3L1 can be associated at the position of the yeast Rrp44 protein. Although originally the S1 domain proteins were thought to have 3'-5' hydrolytic exoribonuclease activity as well, the existence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>activity</b> has recently been questioned and these proteins might have just a role in binding substrates prior to their degradation by the complex.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the early}} {{industrial}} development in Minneapolis was tied to St. Anthony Falls and the power it provided. Between 1848 and 1887, Minneapolis {{led the nation in}} sawmilling. In 1856, the mills produced 12 million board feet (28,000 m³) of lumber. That total had risen to about 91,000,000 board feet (215,000 m³) in 1869, and 960,000,000 board feet (2,270,000 m³) in 1899. During the peak <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>activity,</b> at least 13 sawmills were operating on the falls. The sawmills also supported related industries such as mills that planed and smoothed the lumber; factories that built sashes, doors, and windows; and manufacturers of shingles and wooden buckets.|$|E
5|$|A major {{development}} {{in the second half}} of the 19th century was a rapid expansion of paleontology in North America. In 1858 Joseph Leidy described a Hadrosaurus skeleton, which was the first North American dinosaur to be described from good remains. However, it was the massive westward expansion of railroads, military bases, and settlements into Kansas and other parts of the Western United States following the American Civil War that really fueled the expansion of fossil collection. The result was an increased understanding of the natural history of North America, including the discovery of the Western Interior Sea that had covered Kansas and much of the rest of the Midwestern United States during parts of the Cretaceous, the discovery of several important fossils of primitive birds and horses, and the discovery of a number of new dinosaur genera including Allosaurus, Stegosaurus, and Triceratops. Much <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>activity</b> was part of a fierce personal and professional rivalry between two men, Othniel Marsh, and Edward Cope, which has become known as the Bone Wars.|$|E

5|$|The Society has {{a variety}} of {{functions}} and activities. It supports modern science by disbursing nearly £42million to fund approximately 600 research fellowships for both early and late career scientists, along with innovation, mobility and research capacity grants.

Chem. 272:11321-11326, 1997 confirmed based on structural studies that annexin III did not possess an enzymatic activity.
