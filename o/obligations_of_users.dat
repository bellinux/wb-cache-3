40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to assess the}} damage caused by wild boar in terms of ecosystem-based pespective, take into account the {{influence}} of historical development, document the current status and predict the direction of development. I focused on the farm of Jiri Zevl in Lhotice. I analysed and evaluated the damages caused by wild boar. I already applied measures in terms of their actual effectiveness. In the years 2010, 2011 and 2012, I focused on all the fields on the farm, where damages were noticed. Farm in the period began to apply these two measures against damages caused by animals: chemical protection by Hukinol and also cultivation awned wheat varieties. I compared damage on fields before and after protection. I've always found out and filed damage just a few days before harvesting. For the actual detection and damage assessment, I chose the method of visual inspection. I measured and calculated surface damage I measured individual damaged areas with a tape measure and method of irregular shapes transformed into geometric shapes, Than I calculated their area. According to my research is chemical protection effective as well as the growing awned wheat varieties. In 2010, there were used no precautions, was the damage 31, 539 CZK and there was damaged 18. 3 % of the area of all fields in research. In 2011, the financial loss decreased to 14 941 CZK and the area damaged by animals to 3. 7 % of the total area. In 2012, the damaged area was 7. 8 % and financial loss increased to 29 054 CZK. In conclusion I make recommendations for further action that should dechne damages in the coming years. On the issue of damage caused by wild boar on crops, I have two suggestions: 68 First: It is neccesary to handle this issue since its inception. Increase in the numbers of wild boars has caused intensive farming that disrupted the flow of energy in the country. The solution could be partial cancellation of <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> of hunting grounds cover damage caused by animals. It is necessary to rethink the system, which works now. Not only hunters should be responsible for damage, but also farmers, or owners. Second: It is necessary {{to solve the problem of}} farmers and users of hunting grounds together. It is necessary to choose such a user hunting who will cooperate and will take care to avoid damage. Recovery of damages from the users of hunting area doesn´t solve the problem in the long term sight, it is only a short-term basis and short-sighted...|$|E

First are old challenges related poor conditions and physical deterioration of irrigation and drainage systems; while new ones such as the rising number of farming units not aligned with hydraulic boundaries; variety of crops grown therefore diverging irrigation schedules; mismatch between on-farm irrigation system and smaller farming units; and dissolution of former water management units of collective farms. In the next part of the presentation we provide a cross-country comparison of water reforms implemented by international donor community in the region. As we will show most of WUAs are not water users driven, they have been established via big bang campaigns of governments and donors within the borders of former collective farms without taking into account local context of irrigation and farming. We conclude that the major constraints for the consistency and improved performance <b>of</b> water <b>user</b> groups are found in uneven implementation of water reforms and in some countries, reluctance to change within each country, weak legal basis for the responsibilities and water rights of WUAs, sustainability issues connected with water services pricing and inclusion and <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> water <b>users...</b>|$|R

Particular {{attention is paid to}} the understanding of peat as a mineral that is important for the country's energy. The process of securing right of the peat use in the modern Russian law is analyzed. The question of the relationship of legislation on the subsoil and water legislation is researched, as well as issues of the Law of the Russian Federation "On Subsoil" and the Water Code of the Russian Federation are correlated. In addition the term "swamp", as the object of peat occurrence is considered. In the broader concept of the "wetland" exists in the Ramsar Convention of the 1971. The order of occurrence, termination, as well as the content of a license for the peat use is analyzed. The license is considered as a special governmental approval, including the prescribed form of the document with the State Emblem of the Russian Federation, as well as text, graphics and other supplements that {{are an integral part of}} the license and the fundamental conditions for the subsoil use. Rights and <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> peat <b>users</b> in Russia are analyzed.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{critically}} Mathias Risse's paper “Responsibility and Global Justice. ” First, I argue that for Risse's pluralist {{account of the}} grounds of justice to hold together, there is need to presuppose a monist standpoint which ultimately contributes to grounding principles of justice. Second, I point out that Risse's understanding <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> accountability and justification is rather narrow in that it functions as an addendum to <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Conversely, I will suggest that the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> accountability plays a deeper role: The conditions that ground it feature {{at the same time}} among the grounds <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Accordingly, the kind of relation that gives rise to a duty among agents to account for their actions must be in place when <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice obtain.

40|$|Notions of {{cosmopolitan}} {{and environmental}} citizenship {{have emerged in}} response to concerns about environmental sustainability and global inequality. But {{even if there are}} <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> egalitarian justice that extend across state boundaries, or <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice to use resources in a sustainable way that are owed to those beyond our borders, it is far from clear that these are best conceptualised as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global or environmental citizenship. Through identifying a core concept of citizenship, I suggest that citizenship obligations are, by their nature, owed (at least in part) in virtue of other aspects of one's common citizenship, and that <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice, even when they arise as a result of interconnectedness or past interactions, are not best conceived as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> citizenship in the absence of some other bond that unites the parties. Without ruling out the possibility of beneficial conceptual change, I argue that Andrew Dobson's model of ecological citizenship is flawed because there is no good reason to regard the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice which it identifies as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> ecological citizenship, and that other models of cosmopolitan or global citizenship face a similar objectio...|$|R
