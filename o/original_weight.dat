Never-before-seen areas of the ship including the forecastle (fo'c'sle, commonly known as the anchor chain room), general berthing quarters and the ship's machine shop were opened to the public for the first time. The hangar deck features a new layout and design including new interactive exhibits. Around 1,200 tons of her <b>original</b> <b>weight</b> in steel were removed and 339 epoxy-coated steel pilings ranging in length from 60 to 183 feet were installed. Intrepid also received a new coat of paint, using almost 7,000 gallons to re-paint the interior, hull, towers, and decks.

Crossing the Sahara, where the truck repeatedly got stuck in the sand, proved both a dangerous and laborious task. Once the truck had made it through the desert, however, and reached its final destination, it was revealed that the ice block had lost only about 11% of its <b>original</b> <b>weight.</b> When the expedition reached its goal it generated much media attention for the company. It was called [...] "the world's greatest publicity stunt". To mark the 50th anniversary of the event in 2009, the company made the original documentary of the expedition available online.

However, the population of businesses is highly dynamic. Establishments constantly grow or contract; sometimes they also change their industrial classification or geographical location. Even the number of population units is not fixed but continuously changes over time. A unit may change its size class at the time of estimation or the content of the original stratum may change.

60|$|Mr and Mrs Boffin sat after breakfast, in the Bower, a prey to prosperity. Mr Boffin's face denoted Care and Complication.

He had been engaged in some attempts to make notes of these papers; but being troubled (as men of his stamp often are) with an exceedingly distrustful and corrective thumb, that busy member had so often interposed to smear his notes, that they were little more legible than the various impressions of itself; which blurred his nose and forehead. It is curious to consider, in such a case as Mr Boffin's, what a cheap article ink is, and how far it may be made to go. As a grain of musk will scent a drawer for many years, and still lose nothing appreciable of its <b>original</b> <b>weight,</b> so a halfpenny-worth of ink would blot Mr Boffin to the roots of his hair and the calves of his legs, without inscribing a line on the paper before him, or appearing to diminish in the inkstand.|$|E
6000|$|You {{have asked}} me several times, and I am very glad you have, [...] "How do you weigh gases?" [...] I will shew you; it is very simple, and easily done. Here is a balance, and here a copper bottle, made as light as we can {{consistent}} with due strength, turned very nicely in the lathe, and made perfectly air-tight, with a stop-cock, which we can open and shut, which at present is open, and therefore allows the bottle {{to be full of}} air. I have here a nicely-adjusted balance, in which I think the bottle, in its present condition, will be balanced by the weight on the other side. And here is a pump by which we can force the air into this bottle, and with it we will force in a certain number of volumes of air, as measured by the pump. [Twenty measures were pumped in.] We will shut that in {{and put it in the}} balance. See how it sinks: it is much heavier than it was. By what? By the air that we have forced into it by the pump. There is not a greater bulk of air, but there is the same bulk of heavier air, because we have forced in air upon it. And that you may have a fair notion in your mind as to how much this air measures, here is a jar full of water. We will open that copper vessel into this jar, and let the air return to its former state. All I have to do now is to screw them tightly together, and to turn the taps, when there, you see, is the bulk of the twenty pumps of air which I forced into the bottle; and to make sure that we have been quite correct in what we have been doing, we will take the bottle again to the balance, and, if it is now counterpoised by the <b>original</b> <b>weight,</b> we shall be quite sure we have made our experiment correctly.|$|E

The swelling ratio of starch–chitosan membranes was increased gradually with increasing starch ratio, {{but it was}} always lower than the native chitosan. In dry state, starch–chitosan membranes with low starch ratio (0. 16, 0. 38) showed similar tensile strength values to those of native chitosan while these values decreased with increasing starch ratios (0. 73 – 1. 36). Membranes in physiological buffer solution (PBS) gave a tensile modulus between 2. 8 and 1. 0 MPa, decreasing with increasing starch ratio (0. 16 – 1. 36 (Wstarch/Wchitosan)). When the membranes were incubated in PBS only, a moderate weight loss was observed for the first two weeks. <b>Original</b> <b>weights</b> of low starch weight ratio membranes (0 – 0. 38) were at near 85 %, while high ratio samples (0. 73 – 1. 55) were kept around 70 % after three months.
