5|$|In early {{versions}} of Perl, database interfaces {{were created by}} relinking the interpreter with a client-side database library.

5|$|The Knights {{proceeded}} to rebuild and strengthen castles {{destroyed by the}} Prussians. A number of Prussians escaped either to Sudovia or to Lithuania, or were resettled by the Knights.

5|$|For {{almost a}} century <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the texts were published. In 1875, the {{director}} of the Chilean National Museum of Natural History in Santiago, Rudolf Philippi, published the Santiago Staff, and Carroll (1892) published part of the Oar. Most texts remained beyond the reach of would-be decipherers until 1958, when Thomas Barthel published line drawings of almost all the known corpus in his Grundlagen zur Entzifferung der Osterinselschrift ("Bases for the Decipherment of the Easter Island script") which remains the fundamental reference to rongorongo. He transcribed texts A through X, over 99% of the corpus; the CEIPP estimates that it is 97% accurate. Barthel's line drawings were not produced free-hand but copied from rubbings, which helped ensure their faithfulness to the originals.|$|E

5|$|For {{those with}} pain {{localized}} {{to the lower}} back due to disc degeneration, fair evidence supports spinal fusion as equal to intensive physical therapy and slightly better than low-intensity nonsurgical measures. Fusion may be considered for those with low back pain from acquired displaced vertebra that does not improve with conservative treatment, although <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> those who have spinal fusion experience good results. There {{are a number of}} different surgical procedures to achieve fusion, with no clear evidence of one being better than the others. Adding spinal implant devices during fusion increases the risks but provides no added improvement in pain or function.|$|E
5|$|From {{the moment}} the egg is hatched, the male {{macaroni}} penguin cares for the newly hatched chick. For about 23 to 25 days, the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> its feathers have grown in by this time. The female brings food to the chick every one to two days. When {{they are not being}} protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form crèches to keep warm and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70days, they are ready to go out to sea on their own.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries Dorchester {{suffered}} several serious fires: in 1613, {{caused by}} a tallow chandler's cauldron getting too hot and setting alight; in 1622, started by a maltster; in 1725, begun in a brewhouse; and in 1775, {{caused by a}} soap boiler. The 1613 fire was the most devastating, resulting {{in the destruction of}} 300 houses and two churches (All Saints and Holy Trinity). <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the town's early buildings have survived to the present day, including Judge Jeffreys' lodgings and a Tudor almshouse. Among the replacement Georgian buildings are many, such as the Shire Hall, which are built in Portland stone. The Town Hall was erected in 1791 and had a marketplace underneath.|$|E

5|$|Soon, Manne {{began to}} {{contribute}} to film music in a broader way, often combining jazz, pop, and classical music. Henry Mancini in particular found plenty of work for him; the two shared an interest in experimenting with tone colors, and Mancini came to rely on Manne to shape the percussive effects in his music. Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), Hatari! (1962) and The Pink Panther (1963) are <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> Mancini's films where Manne's drums and special percussive effects could be heard.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji's early {{preoccupation with}} the occult subsided, and he became more {{interested}} in other religions, {{although it is not}} known whether he practised any. He was enthusiastic about Parsi culture, but became disillusioned with Parsis after visiting India in 1932. He embraced <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> aspects of Zoroastrianism, and in later years he was interested in Roman Catholicism, although he did not take it up. For much of his life he practised yoga, but it is not known what branch of it.|$|E
5|$|The E-4 variant {{was fitted}} with {{external}} bomb racks also {{and the empty}} bomb bay space was filled with an 835L (221US gal) tank for aviation fuel and a further 115L (30US gal) oil tank. This increased the loaded weight but increased range to 1,800km (1,130mi). The modifications allowed the He 111 to perform both long- and short-range missions. The E-4's eight internal vertically aligned bomb racks could each carry a 250kg (550lb) bomb. The last E Variant, the He 111E-5, was powered by the Jumo 211A-3, and retained the 835L (221US gal) fuel tank {{on the port side}} of the bomb bay. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the E-4 and E-5 were built.|$|E

5|$|UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff was {{released}} July 18, 1989. After it {{was released}}, the album peaked at number 146 on the Billboard 200. Much like Polka Party! (1986), {{the album was}} considered a major commercial disappointment for the comedian; the album is his second-lowest charting album after Polka Party! (1986). The UHF soundtrack is one of <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> Yankovic's studio albums that is not certified either Gold or Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States. The others include Polka Party! and Poodle Hat (2003). UHF would also be Yankovic's last studio album {{to be released in}} the US on vinyl record until 2011's Alpocalypse.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} these Native Americans were, in deeds and correspondence, {{known as the}} Sepasco Indians, a name {{specific}} to Native Americans in the Sepasco area (modern-day Rhinebeck). The word Sepasco probably originated from the tribe's word for little river or stream, sepuus, which {{is believed to have}} referred to the Landsman Kill, a stream parallel to NY308. After the American Civil War, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the Sepasco were left; the last Sepasco died in a hut near Welch's Cave and Lake Sepasco and was reported in the local newspaper in 1867. By 1685, a trail known as the Sepasco Trail was formed by them and was routed from the Hudson River, eastward through the present-day Village of Rhinebeck, ending at Lake Sepasco. The trail from the Village of Rhinebeck to Lake Sepasco follows roughly modern-day Route308, in some areas slightly to the south, where the highway's side roads are curved in a pattern {{similar to that of the}} Sepasco Trail. It is possible that the trail as a whole existed as a spur of an ancient path that stretched from Rhinebeck to Cornwall, Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|At La Brea, predatory {{birds and}} mammals were {{attracted}} to dead or dying herbivores that had become mired, and then these predators became trapped themselves. Herbivore entrapment was estimated to have occurred once every fifty years, and for every instance of herbivore remains found in the pits there were an estimated ten carnivores. C.d.guildayi {{is the most common}} carnivoran found at LaBrea, followed by Smilodon. Remains of dire wolves outnumber remains of gray wolves in the tar pits by a ratio of five to one. During the Last Glacial Maximum, coastal California, with a climate slightly cooler and wetter than today, is thought to have been a refuge, and a comparison of the frequency of dire wolves and other predator remains at LaBrea to other parts of California and North America indicates significantly greater abundances; therefore, the higher dire wolf numbers in the LaBrea region did not reflect the wider area. Assuming that <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the carnivores that were feeding became trapped, it is likely that fairly sizeable groups of dire wolves fed together on these occasions.|$|E
