When he carelessly throws a rock to vent his frustration, he inadvertently knocks out a man who falls on the track and is run over by a train. Miserably guilt-ridden but resourceful, Seymour collects the body parts and feeds them to Audrey Jr. Meanwhile, at a restaurant, Mushnick discovers he has no money with him, and when he returns to the shop to get some cash, he secretly observes Seymour feeding the plant. Although Mushnick considers telling the police, he procrastinates by the next day when he sees the line <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>waiting</b> to spend money at his shop.|$|E

25|$|Handicap International {{estimates}} {{that up to}} 50 percent of people injured during the attacks have sustained severe injuries that will require rehabilitation to prevent permanent disability. Of the 1.5 million {{people living in the}} Gaza Strip, international and national agencies working in disability and rehabilitation estimate that, even before the military operation, over 10 percent had moderate or severe impairments. They estimate that as many as half of the 5,380 men, women and children injured over the past three weeks of conflict may suffer lifelong impairment, exacerbated by the inability of rehabilitation workers to provide early intervention. These agencies has highlighted the importance of providing early intervention for those newly injured, especially those discharged prematurely from health facilities; re-establishing and strengthening the capacity of rehabilitation services and disabled peoples organizations to respond to the increased need. This is especially critical given that the main provider of specialist rehabilitation services in Gaza sustained severe damage and is not yet fully operational. Even before 27 December, {{the first day of the}} attacks, there was already a back-log <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>waiting</b> for specialised services including rehabilitation and surgery.|$|E

500|$|The most {{controversial}} move was Hitchcock's [...] "no late admission" [...] {{policy for the}} film, which was unusual for the time. It was not entirely original as Clouzot {{had done the same}} in France for Diabolique. Hitchcock thought that if people entered the theater late and never saw the star actress Janet Leigh, they would feel cheated. At first theater owners opposed the idea, claiming that they would lose business. However, after the first day, the owners enjoyed long lines <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>waiting</b> to see the film.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{consumption}} of dog meat is uncommon in France, {{and is now}} considered taboo, dog meat has been consumed in the past by the Gauls. The earliest evidence of dog consumption in France was found at Gaulish archaeological sites, where butchered dog bones were discovered. French news sources from the late 19th century carried stories reporting lines of people buying dog meat, which was described as being [...] "beautiful and light". During the Siege of Paris (1870–1871), food shortages caused by the German blockade of the city caused the citizens of Paris to turn to alternative sources for food, including dog meat. There were lines at butchers' shops <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>waiting</b> to purchase dog meat. Dog meat was also reported as being sold by some butchers in Paris in 1910.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{theme parks}} did evolve from more {{traditional}} amusement park enterprises, such as Knott's Berry Farm. In the 1920s, Walter Knott {{and his family}} sold berries from a roadside stand, which grew to include a restaurant serving fried chicken dinners. Within a few years, lines outside the restaurant were often several hours long. To entertain the waiting crowds, Walter Knott built a Ghost Town in 1940, using buildings relocated from real old west towns such as the Calico, California ghost town and Prescott, Arizona. In 1968, the Knott family fenced the farm, charged admission for the first time, and Knott's Berry Farm officially became an amusement park. Because of its long history, Knott's Berry Farm currently claims to be [...] "America's First Theme Park." [...] Knott's Berry Farm is now owned by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Lake Compounce in Bristol, Connecticut may be the true oldest continuously operating amusement park in the United States, open since 1846. Santa Claus Town, which opened in Santa Claus, Indiana in 1935 and included Santa's Candy Castle and other Santa Claus-themed attractions, is considered the first themed attraction in the United States: a precursor to the modern day theme park. Santa Claus Land (renamed Holiday World in 1984) opened in 1946 in Santa Claus, Indiana and many people will argue {{that it was the}} first true Theme Park despite Knott's history. In the 1950s the Herschend family took over operation of the tourist attraction, Marvel Cave near Branson, Missouri. Over the next decade they modernized the cave, which led to large numbers <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>waiting</b> to take the tour. The Herschend family opened a recreation of the old mining town that once existed atop Marvel Cave. The small village eventually became the theme park, Silver Dollar City. The park is still owned and operated by the Herschends and the family has several other parks including Dollywood, Celebration City and Wild Adventures.|$|E

The automobile came to a standstill before a large electrically illuminated time chart. Nigel alighted for a moment and spoke to one of the inspectors.|$|E

I asked whether this provision of gratis food did in fact pauperize the population, as has been alleged. The Staff-Captain answered that men do not as a rule stop {{out in the middle}} of the winter till past midnight to get a pint of soup and a piece of bread. Of course, there might be exceptions; but for the most part those who take this charity, do so because if is sorely needed.|$|E
