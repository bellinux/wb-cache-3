50|$|Regenerative AC drives are {{a type of}} AC drive {{which have}} the {{capacity}} to recover the braking energy of a load moving faster than the motor speed (an <b>overhauling</b> <b>load)</b> and return it to the power system.|$|E
5000|$|Braking {{choppers}} {{some times}} {{also referred to}} as braking unit are used in the DC voltage intermediate circuits of frequency converters to control voltage when the load feeds energy back to the intermediate circuit. This arises, for example, when a magnetized motor is being rotated by an <b>overhauling</b> <b>load</b> and so functions as a generator feeding power to the DC voltage intermediate circuit.They are an application of the [...] chopper principle, using on-off control of a switching device.|$|E
5|$|Regeneration {{is useful}} in VFDs only where {{the value of the}} {{recovered}} energy is large compared to the extra cost of a regenerative system, and if the system requires frequent braking and starting. Regenerative VFDs are widely used where speed control of <b>overhauling</b> <b>loads</b> is required.|$|R
50|$|Until May 2005, the Linux and Windows clients got major code <b>overhauls</b> and <b>loads</b> {{of tests}} were done to {{estimate}} and improve performance of {{several aspects of}} the data transfer systems. Most importantly, code for a mirrored storage and distribution system for the rendered output started to emerge.|$|R
25|$|J549: Owned and {{operated}} by the Victorian Goldfields Railway, the locomotive was out of service between March 2004 and October 2013, undergoing a major <b>overhaul.</b> Underwent <b>load</b> trials along the Maldon branchline on 21 October 2013. Its first public outing was on 26 October 2013. The official re-launch of the engine was held on 27 January 2014.|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} a control {{system in which}} a cycloconverter is connected between the secondary winding of a three-phase induction machine and the a. c. mains supply to give variable speed sub- and super- synchronous operation. The operating requirements for a three-phase cycloconverter operating in the secondary circuit of an induction machine have been determined. These considerations show that the cycloconverter control signal must be synchronised to the induced secondary emf of the machine. A novel generator based upon digital circuitry was developed to produce such a control signal. A theory in which the cycloconverter is represented as a controlled current source in the secondary circuit of the induction machine has been proposed and verified. Computer programs based upon this theory were used to analyse machine performance. A complete three-phase drive system has been designed and successfully operated over a range above and below synchronous speed with both braking and <b>overhauling</b> <b>loads.</b> Experimental observations have shown that smooth control is possible through synchronous speed...|$|R
5000|$|Phobos arrived San Francisco, California, 23 January 1945. After <b>overhaul</b> and <b>loading</b> cargo she {{deployed}} {{to the western}} Pacific 25 February, via Pearl Harbor and Eniwetok, reaching Ulithi, 24 March. During {{the next three months}} she served at this important American base and replenished ships of the U.S. 5th Fleet during the Okinawa campaign and strikes on the home islands of Japan. Between 20 June and 5 July, she sailed to Pearl Harbor where she was stocking her holds in preparation for the scheduled invasion of Japan when the Japanese ceased hostilities.|$|R
40|$|This unit is {{concerned}} with design responses to transitional urban contexts, targeting transfers between conflicted site systems in Eastern European cities. Our focus will be excesses and ingenuities of shopping in the bewildering context of Moscow – a sophisticated monster with a method to its madness. Political and economic <b>overhauls</b> <b>loaded</b> post-Soviet Moscow with severe tensions. With the transition from central planning to the free market, the unprecedented explosion of commercial space had to absorb clashes between old and new built forms, transit links and use patterns. From imposing hypermarkets to informal outlets, promiscuous shopping {{is at the core}} of Moscow’s paradoxical coexistence of control and freedom, stability and turmoil, staging and neglect. To engage with such an ambiguous context, we will revise our approaches and tools. Fieldwork in Moscow will help link extravagant boutiques and clubs with utilitarian stalls and bars, aweinspiring treasures with shocking eyesores, and grand masterplans with ad hoc deviations. Looking for rules behind inconsistencies, we will remain alert to what things look like in contrast to how they work. The unit will devise analytical and generative tools to convert problems and malfunctions into inventions. Relying on research and diagrammatic analysis of local and global case-studies, we will tackle Moscow’s sore spots to alleviate ruptures between transportation, recreational and cultural programs via shopping. Interventions wil...|$|R
50|$|For {{resupply}} in {{the combat}} area, the ammunition ships Mauna Loa and Shasta left Seeadler 15 September for Kossol Passage, Palau Islands, and upon arrival on the 18th immediately began rearming battleships and cruisers of the Naval Gunfire Support Group. On the 22d the Lassen also left Seeadler for Kossol, where she issued replacement ammunition {{to the support}} group and to Task Force 38.3. Most fire-support ships for STALEMATE were supplied in the Solomons, {{with the exception of}} the battleships Mississippi, which had been <b>overhauled</b> and <b>loaded</b> on the west coast, and the Maryland, loaded at Pearl after completion of battle-damage repairs. Naval Base Tulagi reported for August 1944 that the magazine issued 2,600 tons of ammunition to destroyers, cruisers, and battleships, and 500 tons to landing craft. The Tennessee, which collided on 23 August with the California, was able to join the fire-support group after repair, but the California did not leave Espiritu until 18 September.|$|R
50|$|Corvus {{departed}} Providence 2 December 1944 for San Francisco, {{where she}} loaded cargo for Leyte. Arriving in the Philippines 21 February 1945, Corvus discharged cargo at Guiuan {{for the establishment}} of an air base there, and transferred cargo at Dulag. On 13 March she began rehearsals for the Okinawa operation, and sailed from Leyte Gulf 27 March for the landings 1 April. She remained off Okinawa undergoing the first of the kamikaze attacks, until 10 April when she sailed with Army casualties for Guam, arriving 14 April. Corvus then sailed for Pearl Harbor where, according to a crew member oral history, new engines were installed. Corvus then returned to the West Coast for <b>overhaul,</b> and <b>loaded</b> Army men and supplies at Seattle sailing 15 June for Tinian, where she arrived 3 July. Cargo was said to have been parts to load F31, Fat Man assembly parts to load Fat Man onto aircraft named Bockscar to drop bomb on Nagasaki, Japan. Project Alberta was name of the operation and Bockscar the aircraft that dropped the assembled bomb.|$|R
