40|$|Dental cement-based {{mixture of}} zinc oxide and eugenol {{is one of}} the {{commonly}} used <b>dental</b> <b>cement.</b> One of the major shortcomings that limit its application is <b>dental</b> <b>cement</b> zinc oxide and eugenol has detrimental mechanical properties. This study aims to carry out the synthesis and characterization of nano-based <b>dental</b> <b>cement</b> of zinc oxide mixed with eugenol with the hypothesis that zinc oxide nanoparticles will provide better mechanical properties. Physical and mechanical properties of cement-based <b>dental</b> <b>cement</b> oxide nanoparticles will be compared with <b>dental</b> <b>cement</b> zinc oxide microparticles. Mixing eugenol and ZnO nanoparticles were made by the composition of the powder 0. 4 g, 0. 45 g, 0. 5 g, 0. 55 g, 0. 6 g and 0. 2 mL of fluid. ZnO nanoparticles as a powder slowly mixed with liquid, so as to produce pasta. Methods of analysis include compressive strength, hardness and microstructure observation. From a series of studies and analysis, the surface morphology of the samples obtained by the nanoparticles-based <b>dental</b> <b>cement</b> is smoother and has a little fracture compared with microparticles-based <b>dental</b> <b>cement.</b> Likewise, the mechanical analysis of <b>dental</b> <b>cement,</b> ZnO nanoparticles can increase the compressive strength and hardness of thematerial.

This study evaluated the cytotoxicity and biological effects of yttria partially stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP) blocks {{in combination with}} several <b>dental</b> <b>cements.</b> Materials and Methods Pairs of zirconia cylinders with medium alone or cemented with three types of <b>dental</b> <b>cement</b> including RelyX U 200 (3 M ESPE), FujiCEM 2 (GC), and Panavia F 2. 0 (Kuraray) were incubated in medium for 14 days. The cytotoxicity of each supernatant was determined using 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazole- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays on L 929 fibroblasts and MC 3 T 3 -E 1 osteoblasts. The levels of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) mRNA were evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and IL- 6 protein was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The {{data were analyzed using}} one-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests. A p < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results The MTT assays showed that MC 3 T 3 -E 1 osteoblasts were more susceptible to <b>dental</b> <b>cements</b> than L 929 fibroblasts.

40|$|AbstractFour {{types of}} {{bioactive}} nano-silica were prepared by different methods, and {{were used to}} improve commercial <b>dental</b> Glass Ionomer <b>Cement</b> (GIC) bioactivity. The prepared powder samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to identify the formed phase; particle size and morphology were assessed by transmission electron microscope (TEM). The bioactivity of the prepared powder samples and its <b>dental</b> <b>cement</b> blends were applied in simulated body fluid (SBF). The change in surface morphology and composition after soaking in SBF after week at 37 °C were determined by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM with EDS) and Fourier transform infrared analyses (FTIR).

Precipitations of carbonate–apatite on the silica surface were observed by FT-IR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Silica dissolution and re-precipitation phenomena were also observed from SEM. The relationship between both phenomena during the in vitro test is discussed mainly in terms of structural and microstructural features of the silica.

40|$|<b>Dental</b> {{restorative}} <b>cements</b> {{are placed}} in a harsh oral environment where they are subjected to thermal shock, chemical degradation, and repeating masticatory force. The ideal restorative <b>dental</b> <b>cements</b> should have superior mechanical properties, chemical stability, aesthetic, good handling properties, biocompatibility, antibacterial properties, and preferably bioactivity. This thesis presents research on <b>dental</b> restorative <b>cements</b> with enhanced properties. The overall aim was to increase the bioactivity and antibacterial properties of <b>dental</b> restorative <b>cements</b> without affecting their other properties. The effect from adding calcium silicate to glass ionomer cement (GIC) was investigated. The results showed that calcium silicate could increase the bioactivity and reduce the cytotoxicity of conventional glass ionomer cement without compromising its setting and mechanical properties. Hydroxyapatite (HA) with a high aspect ratio and thin nacreous-layered monetite sheets were also synthesized. Nano HA particles with an aspect ratio of 50 can be synthesized by both precipitation and hydrothermal methods. The aspect ratio was controlled via the pH of reaction medium. Thin nacreous-layered monetite sheets were synthesized through a self-assembly process {{in the presence of}} an amine based cationic quaternary surfactant. Temperature, pH, and presence of surfactant played essential roles in forming the nacreous-layered monetite sheets. Then the effect from adding silver doped HA and monetite particles was investigated. The results showed that the antibacterial properties of GIC could be increased by incorporating silver doped HA and monetite particles. Further examination showed that the pH change, F- ion release, and concentration of released Ag+ ions were not responsible for the improved antibacterial properties. The quasi-static strengths and compressive fatigue limits of four types of the most commonly used dental restorations were evaluated. In our study, resin modified GIC and resin-based composite showed superior static compressive strength and fatigue limits compared to conventional GIC. The static compressive strength of <b>dental</b> <b>cements</b> increased with the aging time.

40|$|The {{improvement}} and {{modification of the}} surface hardness of glass-ionomer <b>dental</b> <b>cements</b> was investigated in the studies discussed in this thesis to allow the range of clinical applications of these cements to be extended. Storing the cements in non-aqueous media whilst heating at 60 oC increased the surface hardness compared to storage in water at 37 oC. The corresponding compressive strength showed no significant changes. The bioactivity of two commercially available glass-ionomer <b>dental</b> <b>cements</b> was investigated after it was established that the surface hardness of a <b>dental</b> <b>cement</b> was improved by storing the materials in biologically natural bovine milk. In particular the observations of {{the appearance of the}} surface were noted as well as cation release studies and calcium to phosphorus ratios calculated. The results indicated that a surface layer of calcium phosphate had formed and created a barrier around the cement preventing the loss of strengthening ions. An investigation was also made into formulating a novel hybrid cement. This process included the deployment of additives/co-reactants within the cement formulation. By incorporating zinc phosphate into a strontium based glass-ionomer elevated levels of fluoride release were obtained when compared to the original commercially available glass-ionomer. SEM images show that this additive had an effect on the surface morphology of the glass. The bioactivity studies performed on these cements show the uptake of calcium over one week, indicating that there is the possibility that these new hybrid cements are bioactive. Refinement of the new hybrid materials has produced cements with antimicrobial properties as well as higher surface hardness values than the original glass-ionomer.
