5|$|Like his father, Adams {{embarked}} on a political career {{with the support of}} the Boston Caucus. He was elected to his first political office in 1747, serving as one of the clerks of the Boston market. In 1756, the Boston Town Meeting elected him to the post of tax collector, which provided a small income. He often failed to collect taxes from his fellow citizens, which increased his popularity among those who did not pay, but left him liable for the shortage. By 1765, his account was more than £8,000 in arrears. The town meeting was on the verge of bankruptcy, and Adams was compelled to file suit against delinquent taxpayers, but many taxes went uncollected. In 1768, his political opponents used the situation to their advantage, obtaining a court judgment of £1,463 against him. Adams's friends paid off some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit,</b> and the town meeting wrote off the remainder. By then, he had emerged as a leader of the popular party, and the embarrassing situation did not lessen his influence.|$|E

25|$|Lithuania was for {{the fifth}} {{consecutive}} time at the Olympic bronze match, hoping to get their fourth medals against former Olympic champions Argentina. Though, the tough semifinal had the Lithuanians tired and emotionally distraught, which the experienced adversary took advantage despite not counting with injured star Manu Ginóbili. By the third quarter, the game seemed already lost as Lithuanians trailed 67–49. The reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> in the fourth {{was not enough to}} prevent Lithuania from losing another third place game, 75–87.

25|$|Russia {{had lost}} {{two of its}} three fleets. Only its Black Sea Fleet remained, {{and this was the}} result of an earlier treaty that had {{prevented}} the fleet from leaving the Black Sea. Japan became the sixth-most powerful naval force by combined tonnage, while the Russian Navy declined to one barely stronger than that of Austria–Hungary. The actual costs of the war were large enough to affect the Russian economy and, despite grain exports, the nation developed an external balance of payments deficit. The cost of military re-equipment and re-expansion after 1905 pushed the economy further into deficit, although the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> was obscured.|$|E
40|$|This paper gauges {{the causal}} {{relationship}} between external and budget deficits by using Blanchard's overlapping generations model. This model sests <b>the</b> twin <b>deficits</b> hypothesis (i. e. {{there is a}} positive relationship between <b>the</b> <b>deficits)</b> and <b>the</b> Ricardian equivalence hypothesis (i. e. there is no link between <b>the</b> <b>deficits).</b> This model also implies that consumers forecast future budget deficits using (at least) <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>deficits.</b> This implication is used to derive time series restrictions, which are testable for given comsumer's planning horizons. For the relevant horizon, <b>the</b> response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> external <b>deficit</b> to an increase in <b>the</b> budget <b>deficit</b> is computed. For the Canadian and the U. S. economies, the relevant horizons can be as long as 83 years. However, given <b>the</b> persistence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> budget <b>deficits,</b> these horizons produce responses that are statistically significant.

25|$|The public's {{concern about}} {{the federal budget deficit}} and fears of {{professional}} politicians allowed the independent candidacy of billionaire Texan Ross Perot to explode on the scene in dramatic fashion—at one point Perot was leading the major party candidates in the polls. Perot crusaded against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and internal and external national debt, tapping into voters' potential fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit.</b> His volunteers succeeded in collecting enough signatures to get his name on the ballot in all 50 states. In June, Perot led the national public opinion polls with support from 39% of the voters (versus 31% for Bush and 25% for Clinton). Perot severely damaged his credibility by dropping out of the presidential contest in July and remaining out of the race for several weeks before re-entering. He compounded this damage by eventually claiming, without evidence, that his withdrawal was due to Republican operatives attempting to disrupt his daughter's wedding.|$|E

Beshear countered that the legislature had already authorized $138 million in expenditures from the surplus fund and that his reckoning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> also included $300 million in [...] "additional spending needs". Williams stopped short of filing a legal challenge to the cuts, but warned Beshear that the General Assembly would closely monitor the cuts and override any they disagreed with by passing modifications to the 2006–2008 budget after the commencement of the legislative session in February.|$|E
