5|$|Rapoport {{has argued}} that Sorabji's {{reluctance}} to make commercial recordings <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>music</b> stemmed from a fear of losing control over the making of future recordings of it, because of UK copyright laws of the time.|$|E
5|$|Strauss {{married the}} singer Henrietta Treffz in 1862, and they {{remained}} together {{until her death}} in 1878. Six weeks after her death, Strauss married the actress Angelika Dittrich.

5|$|After {{getting his}} degree, O'Donnell moved to Chicago, where he {{expected}} {{that he would}} teach at the American Conservatory of Music. The job fell through, and instead {{he worked as a}} grip in the film and television business. O'Donnell began his musical career in the field after one of his colleagues who knew <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>music</b> background approached him to write for his film. O'Donnell talked to his friend Michael Salvatori, who had his own recording studio, and offered to split the profits from the job with him; the two became constant partners.|$|E

5|$|Another major 20th-century {{composer}} {{who engaged}} Beecham's sympathies was Sibelius, who recognised {{him as a}} fine conductor <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>music</b> (although Sibelius tended to be lavish with praise of anybody who conducted his music). In a live recording of a December 1954 concert performance of Sibelius's Second Symphony with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in the Festival Hall, Beecham can be heard uttering encouraging shouts at the orchestra at climactic moments.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Pierre Messiaen enlisted and Cécile took their two boys {{to live with her}} brother in Grenoble.

Later, Messiaen felt most at home in the Alps of the Dauphiné, where he had a house built south of Grenoble where he composed most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cyberpunk is {{the fifth}} studio album by English rock vocalist Billy Idol. A concept album, it was {{released}} in 1993 by Chrysalis Records. Inspired by his personal interest in technology and his first attempts to use computers in the creation <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>music,</b> Idol based the album on the cyberdelic subculture of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Heavily experimental in its style, the album was an attempt by Idol {{to take control of}} the creative process in the production of his albums, while simultaneously introducing Idol's fans and other musicians to the opportunities presented by digital media.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} two decades of his life, Josquin's fame spread abroad along with his music. The newly {{developed}} technology of printing made wide dissemination <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>music</b> possible, and Josquin was the favorite of the first printers: one of Petrucci's first publications, and the earliest surviving print of music by a single composer, was a book of Josquin's masses which he printed in Venice in 1502. This publication was successful enough that Petrucci published two further volumes of Josquin's masses, in 1504 and 1514, and reissued them several times.|$|E

From the publication dates <b>of</b> <b>his</b> collections, he seems to have composed most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sacred <b>music</b> and instrumental music in the service of the Habsburgs, and likely wrote much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> secular <b>music</b> – particularly the Italian madrigals, as might be expected – while he was in Venice.|$|R

Of the 200 or so arrangements that Lutosławski and Panufnik had worked on for their piano duo, only Lutosławski's Paganini Variations survived. Lutosławski returned to the ruins of Warsaw after the Polish-Soviet treaty in April 1945.|$|E
