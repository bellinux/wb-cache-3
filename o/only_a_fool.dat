2500|$|Today, Mount Fuji is an {{international}} destination for tourism and mountain climbing. In the early 20thcentury, populist educator Frederick Starr's Chautauqua lectures about his several ascents of Mount Fuji—1913, 1919, and 1923—were widely known in America. [...] A well-known Japanese saying suggests that a wise person will climb Mt. Fuji once in their lifetime, but <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> would climb it twice. It remains a popular symbol in Japanese culture, including making numerous movie appearances, inspiring the Infiniti logo, and even appearing in medicine with the Mount Fuji sign.|$|E
2500|$|In 1856, the Royal Geographical Society funded another {{expedition}} {{in which}} Burton set off from Zanzibar to explore an [...] "inland sea" [...] {{that had been}} described by Arab traders and slavers. His mission was to study the area's tribes {{and to find out}} what exports might be possible from the region. It was hoped that the expedition might lead to the discovery of the source of the River Nile, although this was not an explicit aim. Burton had been told that <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> would say his expedition aimed to find the source of the Nile because anything short of that would then be regarded as a failure.|$|E
2500|$|Anquetil took a forthright and {{controversial}} {{stand on the}} use of performance-enhancing drugs. He never hid that he took drugs and in a debate with a government minister on French television said <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> would imagine it was possible to ride Bordeaux–Paris on just water. He and other cyclists had to ride through [...] "the cold, through heatwaves, in the rain and in the mountains", and they had the right to treat themselves as they wished, he said in a television interview, before adding: [...] "Leave me in peace; everybody takes dope." [...] There was implied acceptance of doping right {{to the top of the}} state: the president, Charles de Gaulle, said of Anquetil: [...] "Doping? What doping? Did he or did he not make them play the Marseillaise [...] abroad?" ...|$|E

6000|$|He put {{a stress}} on the word Swede as if it meant scoundrel. He detested Scandinavians generally. Why? Goodness <b>only</b> knows. <b>A</b> <b>fool</b> like that is unfathomable. He continued: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Minnie," [...] he said finally, [...] "it pains {{me to tell}} you, but {{you married}} a fool. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> would have gone {{overboard}} as I did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> but a brute," [...] {{he said in}} a lower voice. [...] "Forgive me. I {{have given}} you pain,--you, for whom I would have died." ...|$|E

60|$|Richard's sneer was audible to all. Oh, he was {{gathering}} courage fast {{now that there}} no longer was the need for it. It urged him to lengths of daring possible <b>only</b> to <b>a</b> <b>fool.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "Everybody {{knows nothing}} of the kind. I know {{nothing of the}} kind. And you are <b>only</b> making <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> of yourself. Mr. Houston is a penniless adventurer and is only {{attached}} to my money. He shall never see a penny of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{she walked}} home--without hurrying--she remembered her father saying {{to a serious}} ten-year-old Carol, [...] "Lady, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> thinks he's {{superior}} to beautiful bindings, but only a double-distilled fool reads nothing but bindings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then--" [...] The captain hesitated {{and cleared}} his throat. [...] "With {{all the money}} you've got, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> would take the risk you did with those two curs. What {{do you do it}} for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This kind {{of thing}} must stop," [...] he said. [...] "I haven't grumbled much, perhaps {{not as much as}} I ought, about your extravagance, but <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> imagines he can spend more than he has got." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; but not much. <b>Only</b> I'm such <b>a</b> <b>fool.</b> I {{turned off}} when I began taking off my boots. No, no--don't! Don't call any one. It is nothing!' ...|$|R
6000|$|He hasn't got {{a notion}} of how {{children}} ought to play, [...] And can <b>only</b> make <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> of me in every sort of way. [...] He stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see; [...] I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me! ...|$|R
60|$|Well, mother, {{between you}} and me I don't mind telling you that Ronny is much more suited to this {{particular}} job than I am. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> perfect <b>fool</b> would have hesitated, and for the honour of the family we can't suspect Uncle Arthur of being that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jaqui now {{thought his}} {{troubles}} were over; {{but he was}} mistaken. A new persecutor appeared, who belonged to a fourth class, fortunately not a very large one. This person {{was a young man}} who was not <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> but a poet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "... From {{an early}} age I {{realized}} that I had exceptional abilities. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> underestimates his capabilities. My brain power was greatly above the average. I know that I was born to succeed. My appearance {{was the only thing}} against me. I was quiet and insignificant--utterly nondescript....|$|E
60|$|It came to Mr. Blood, as he trudged forward {{under the}} laden apple-trees on that fragrant, delicious July morning, that man--as {{he had long}} suspected--was the vilest work of God, and that <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> would set himself up as a healer of a species that was best exterminated.|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{it will be}} well if he {{have not}} done so as a man.

Can I explain under what stress of entreaty I went down there on this last occasion?" ...|$|E
60|$|Not {{that the}} Honorable Erastus cared a fig about this foolish talk of exterminating {{advertising}} signs. He was himself a large stockholder in a breakfast-food factory, which painted signs wherever it could secure space. These signs were not works of art, {{but they were}} distinctly helpful to business, and <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool,</b> {{in the opinion of}} the Honorable Erastus, would protest against the inevitable.|$|E
60|$|When poor Masella saw her table-cloths {{and sheets}} being destroyed, and {{that instead of}} {{becoming}} rich she had <b>only</b> been made <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> of, she seized another stick and belaboured Antonio so unmercifully with it, that he fled before her, and never stopped till he reached the ogre's cave.|$|R
6000|$|... "He gave Parker a five-pound note. Parker is <b>only</b> <b>a</b> {{grasping}} <b>fool.</b> He concocted {{the story}} of Mr. Dobson and the lease. He is always listening at key-holes, {{and he knows that}} Mr. Dobson often sends up a clerk with papers for Uncle Rad's signature. Those things are not very difficult to manage. If one man is determined, and the other corruptible, it's done sooner or later." ...|$|R

6000|$|He.--What is it? {{why it is}} what we retail {{before our}} little [...] patroness about the Dangeville or the Clairon, mixed up here and [...] there with {{a word or two}} to put you on the scent.

5000|$|Seven {{months before}} the announcement, the Gujarati {{newspaper}} Akila published an article that [...] "announced" [...] the demonetisation of 500 and 1000 rupee notes. The editor of the newspaper claimed that it was <b>only</b> <b>an</b> April <b>fools</b> day prank. The article contained many details that matched the actual announcement in November, including {{the creation of new}} ₹2000 notes. The coincidence received wide coverage, and was called [...] "mystical" [...] and [...] "uncanny." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{developed}} {{an interest in}} the teachings of George Gurdjieff but in 1974 turned down an invitation to attend the movement's training school, deciding instead to travel in Europe, armed <b>only</b> with <b>a</b> <b>fool's</b> hat and <b>a</b> melodica. In Amsterdam he met a fellow American and accepted an invitation to stay in a commune in Kentish Town, North London. There he stayed for some years, taking over a leatherworking business from another departing American resident and running a leather goods stall in the newly opened Camden Lock Market.|$|R
40|$|What {{explains}} readers’ continued {{fascination with}} the novels of John Irving? How does Irving blend storytelling inspired {{by the likes of}} Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy with the harsh realities of the 20 th and 21 st centuries? Is such a thing even possible, or <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool’s</b> errand? Dark Apprenticeships explores Irving’s evolution as a significant American author, his overall contribution, and key motifs in his writing – which range from examinations of the art of storytelling itself, to the seemingly eternal war of the sexes, the horror of crimes intentionally or unintentionally perpetrated against children, and the unsung hardships faced by minorities of all kinds, all the while upholding the key tenets of the Bildungsroman: growth and hope. By examining in-depth five essential novels – The World According to Garp, The Hotel New Hampshire, The Cider House Rules, A Widow for One Year, and Until I Find You – it presents a unique portrait of the author, his personal growth, and his rightful place {{in the tradition of the}} Bildungsroman or apprenticeship novel...|$|R
