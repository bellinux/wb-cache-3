5|$|Shōgo Suzuki/Steve Blum as Vincent Valentine. Nomura wanted Cloud and Vincent to have noticeably {{different}} voices {{because the}} characters were otherwise quite similar. Since Vincent was <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> mature than Cloud, his role {{was given to}} Suzuki, who has a very low voice.|$|E
5|$|About 175,000 black {{residents}} departed New Orleans {{over the year}} following the storm, while only 100,000 returned, pushing the African American population to 59 percent, from 66 percent previously. The biggest impact {{has been on the}} middle-class blacks, given that most black professionals are <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> advanced in their careers, and the majority of the affluent and middle class are white.|$|E
5|$|Some {{plantations}} {{are open}} to tourists; Maison de la Vanille for instance, near Haamene, permits visitors to view the vanilla preparation and drying processes. The island of Tahaa offers a tour, conducted by a private outfit, that takes visitors {{to one of the}} <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> voluminous plantations, situated on Hurepiti Bay.|$|E
50|$|Illiteracy {{is still}} high, {{especially}} among women. In 2001 54.5% {{of the women}} being 19 years <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> were illiterate <b>and</b> 19.8% of the men. On an average {{the inhabitants of the}} Vacas Municipality being 19 years <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> have attended school for 3.23 years (women: 2.24 years, men: 4.38 years).|$|R

5|$|After the war, {{the tribes}} were better {{represented}} in the republican government. In 1969, sheikhs were brought into the National Assembly and in 1971 into the Consultative Council. Under Iryani, the sheikhs, particularly the ones who fought for the republicans and were close to the mediation attempt. By {{the end of the}} war there was a breach between the <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> liberal politicians and republican sheiks, and certain army sheiks and activists from South Yemen. In the summer of 1972, a border war broke and ended with a declaration from both North Yemen and South Yemen that they would reunite, but they did not. There were complaints in North Yemen about foreign influence by Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|Bad Blood (2003) was a {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and presented by Maxim Hair Color, which took place on June 15, 2003, at the Compaq Center in Houston, Texas. It was the second event produced under the Bad Blood name and starred wrestlers from the Raw brand. This event {{marked the beginning of}} worldwide pay-per-views (with the exception of the <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> significant Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Survivor Series pay-per-views) being brand exclusive (UK-only pay-per-views had been brand exclusive since Insurrextion 2002).|$|E
5|$|He {{also started}} a {{successful}} private company {{in partnership with}} the <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> experienced Michael Grubb, one of the directors of the SOIC and founder of the first Swedish trading office in Canton. They traded in Canton and Macao, which technically was against the rules and regulations in the charter of the SOIC. Grill took advantage of the fact that his father was a director of the SOIC, and until his father's death shipped his own goods on board SOIC ships. From Europe the ships brought objets d'art, corals from the Mediterranean Sea, expensive clocks and other mechanical automatons known to the Chinese as sing-songs. Such goods were appreciated by the Emperor and the rich mandarins.|$|E

5|$|Improvements in {{structural}} alignment methods {{constitute an}} active area of research, and new or modified methods are often proposed that are claimed to offer advantages over the <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> widely distributed techniques. A recent example, TM-align, uses a novel method for weighting its distance matrix, to which standard dynamic programming is then applied. The weighting is proposed {{to accelerate the}} convergence of dynamic programming and correct for effects arising from alignment lengths. In a benchmarking study, TM-align {{has been reported to}} improve in both speed and accuracy over DALI and CE.|$|E
5|$|In adult house sparrows, annual {{survival}} is 45–65%. After fledging {{and leaving the}} care of their parents, young sparrows have a high mortality rate, which lessens as they grow <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> experienced. Only about 20–25% of birds hatched survive to their first breeding season. The oldest known wild house sparrow lived for nearly two decades; it was found dead 19years and 9months after it was ringed in Denmark. The oldest recorded captive house sparrow lived for 23years. The typical ratio of males to females in a population is uncertain due to problems in collecting data, but a very slight preponderance of males at all ages is usual.|$|E
5|$|<b>Older</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> deeply eroded, the Western Cascades are a {{range of}} volcanoes lying west of and merging with the High Cascades. They consist of partly altered {{volcanic}} rock from vents in both volcanic provinces, including varied lavas and ash tuffs {{ranging in age from}} 0 to 40million years. As the Cascades rose, the Rogue maintained its flow to the ocean by down-cutting, which created steep narrow gorges and rapids in many places. Bear Creek, a Rogue tributary that flows south to north, marks the boundary between the Western Cascades to the east and the Klamath Mountains to the west.|$|E

5|$|On December 2, 1896, Earp was {{a last-minute}} choice as referee for a boxing match that the {{promoters}} {{billed as the}} heavyweight championship of the world. Bob Fitzsimmons was set to fight Tom Sharkey {{that night at the}} Mechanics' Pavilion in San Francisco. Earp had refereed 30 or so matches in earlier days, though not under the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, but under the <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> liberal London Prize Ring Rules. The fight may have been the most anticipated fight on American soil that year. Fitzsimmons was favored to win, and the public and even civic officials placed bets on the outcome.|$|E
5|$|On March 1 ("Super Tuesday"), Clinton {{won seven}} of eleven contests, {{including}} {{a string of}} dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters and opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders. She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout being that Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents, while Clinton did better among <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> diverse voter populations and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.|$|E
5|$|Rodents may be born either altricial (blind, hairless and {{relatively}} underdeveloped) or precocial (mostly furred, {{eyes open and}} fairly developed) depending on the species. The altricial state is typical for squirrels and mice, while the precocial state usually occurs in species like guinea pigs and porcupines. Females with altricial young typically build elaborate nests before they give birth and maintain them until their offspring are weaned. The female gives birth sitting or lying down and the young emerge in the direction she is facing. The newborns first venture out of the nest {{a few days after}} they have opened their eyes and initially keep returning regularly. As they get <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> developed, they visit the nest less often and leave permanently when weaned.|$|E

50|$|The {{most recent}} report {{indicates}} that rabbits {{have been introduced}} on over 800 islands worldwide. However, this report is nearly 20 years <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> introductions have certainly happened since that time. Through grazing, rabbits alter the vegetative structure of islands that seabirds depend on for breeding activities.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first known}} European Otago gold find was at Goodwood, near Palmerston in October 1851. The find {{was of a}} very small amount with no ensuing [...] "rush".

5|$|Tactile {{communication}} (touch) {{is mostly}} used by lemurs {{in the form}} of grooming, although the ring-tailed lemur also clumps together to sleep (in an order determined by rank), reaches out and touches adjacent members, and cuffs other members. Reaching out and touching another individual in this species {{has been shown to be}} a submissive behavior, done by younger or submissive animals towards <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> dominant members of the troop. Allogrooming, however, appears to occur more frequently between higher ranking individuals, a shared trait with other primate species. Unlike anthropoid primates, lemur grooming seems to be more intimate and mutual, often directly reciprocated. Anthropoids, on the other hand, use allogrooming to manage agonistic interactions. The ring-tailed lemur is known to be very tactile, spending between 5 and 11% of its time grooming.|$|E
5|$|The {{world record}} stayed in Planica for four years, {{during which the}} K-point at Velikanka bratov Gorišek was {{upgraded}} to 165m {{in time for the}} inaugural Ski Flying World Championships in 1972, which eventually superseded International Ski Flying Week. This new event was sanctioned a year earlier by the FIS at their 28th International Ski Congress in Opatija, Croatia (then a part of Yugoslavia). Much like in 1938 when the discipline received official recognition from the FIS, another milestone had been reached as ski flying was now granted its own world championship-level event on par with the Ski Jumping World Championships, having spent almost four decades as a mere 'special attraction' alongside its <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> prestigious sibling.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{advancement}} in 2049 {{is not based}} on merit or politics alone, rather executives can issue challenges to each other which are held on highways emptied of cars and usually fought to the death, in a fashion similar to Mad Max, a source cited as inspiration by the author in the acknowledgements of the book. Chris Faulkner gains recognition and small celebrity for a particularly brutal win over a much <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> seasoned member of his firm, from which he is head-hunted by Shorn to join their team. Within the media landscape, business executives have fame on the order of sports stars or movie actors and their driving duels are analysed and covered as sporting events. Chris' wife Carla is also his mechanic, a vital role where an executive's car is the difference between promotion and death. She is not a fan of the way he makes his living, but they have an initially strong relationship.|$|E

5|$|Like her two predecessors, Ranavalona {{concluded}} a political marriage with Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony. The young queen's role was largely ceremonial as nearly all important political decisions {{continued to be}} made by the much <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> experienced prime minister. Ranavalona was frequently called upon to deliver formal speeches (kabary) to the public on behalf of Rainilaiarivony and would make appearances to inaugurate new public buildings, such as a hospital at Isoavinandriana and a girls' school at Ambodin'Andohalo. Throughout her reign, Ranavalona's aunt, Ramisindrazana, acted as an adviser and exercised considerable influence at court. Ranavalona's older sister, Rasendranoro, whose son Rakatomena and daughter Razafinandriamanitra lived with their mother at the Rova, was also a close companion. An American journalist who visited her palace reported that Ranavalona spent much of her leisure time flying kites or playing lotto, a parlor game, with her relatives and other ladies at court. She also enjoyed knitting, needlework and crocheting and would frequently bring her latest craft project to work on at cabinet meetings. She had a great love of fine garments and was the only Malagasy sovereign to import the majority of her clothing from Paris rather than London.|$|E
