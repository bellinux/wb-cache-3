5|$|Heat Seduction was {{released}} in August 2016, after Heat Kissed. It is packaged in a golden bottle. The top notes are of spices mandarin, dewberry. The middle notes are of ginger <b>orchid,</b> African jungle <b>orchid,</b> freesia. And the base notes are of amber, musk and labdanum.|$|E
5|$|Twelve of {{them were}} {{inventoried}} in 2003, and their populations have been managed since. The light undergrowth contains common spotted <b>orchid</b> (Dactylorhiza fuchsii) and round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia). Liquorice milkvetch (Astragalus glycyphyllos) and narrow-leaved everlasting-pea (Lathyrus sylvestris) {{are present in the}} small herb glade. The population of lesser butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia) is located in the pioneer wood. In the glade with Calamagrostide and at the boundary of a pioneer grove grow pyramidal <b>orchid</b> (Anacamptis pyramidalis). bee <b>orchid</b> (Ophrys apifera) and man <b>orchid</b> (Orchis anthropophora) grow everywhere, except in the older glade. In the different herbaceous fringes grow wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) and zigzag clover (Trifolium medium). A tall herb fringe hosts common butterbur (Petasites hybridus).|$|E
50|$|These {{primitive}} features make them, {{according to}} some authorities, not true <b>orchids</b> but rather ancestors of modern <b>orchids.</b> However, more recent studies indicate that many of their differences with the other <b>orchids</b> were not inherited from a common ancestor with <b>orchids,</b> but arose within the stem group of apostasioid <b>orchids.</b>|$|R

5|$|Adaptation {{had been}} in {{development}} {{as far back as}} 1994. Jonathan Demme brought the project to Columbia Pictures with Kaufman writing the script. Kaufman experienced writer's block and {{did not know what to}} think of The <b>Orchid</b> Thief. Finally he wrote a script based on his experience of adapting the book into a screenplay. Jonze signed to direct, and filming was finished in June 2001. Though the film is billed as an adaptation of The <b>Orchid</b> Thief, its primary narrative focus is Charlie Kaufman's struggle to adapt The <b>Orchid</b> Thief into a film, while dramatizing the events of the book in parallel. Adaptation also adds a number of fictitious elements, including Kaufman's twin brother (also credited as a writer for the film) and a romance between Orlean and Laroche, and culminates in completely invented events including fictional versions of Orlean and Laroche three years after the events related in The <b>Orchid</b> Thief.|$|E
5|$|In this way, {{the bucket}} <b>orchid</b> passes its pollen from flower to flower.

The objectives of the research was to know species of <b>orchids</b> that were used as medicinal plants by Batak ethnic in North Sumatra. Respond-ents consisted of traditional medicine plants traders in the traditional markets and traditional healers.

5|$|Russulaceae {{are also}} an {{important}} group of <b>orchid</b> mycorrhizal fungi. This symbiosis is mutualistic {{in the case of}} green orchids, but a partly or fully epiparasitic relationship in the case of myco-heterotrophic and mixotrophic orchids, respectively. In some cases, the association with Russulaceae is, as in monotropoid mycorrhiza, very specific: the Mediterranean <b>orchid</b> Limodorum abortivum predominantly associates with Russula delica and closely related species; in Corallorhiza maculata, different genotypes of the same species have distinct Russula partners.|$|E
5|$|The {{preservation}} of the existing diversity {{was the most important}} goal. It required conservation of the heritage plant communities: tall-herb fen with common butterbur, the chasmophytic vegetation with hart's-tongue fern and the woody fringe Lathyro sylvestris – Astragaletum glycyphylli. The survival of populations of round-leaved wintergreen and of man <b>orchid,</b> the two most interesting plants, was also a priority, as a strikeout against brush invasion in the open areas where bee <b>orchid</b> and pyramidal <b>orchid</b> grow. The natural forest dynamics are to be contained within areas of clear undergrowth or fringes with these species: common spotted <b>orchid,</b> zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid. Pioneer areas with mushrooms should be preserved and the invasive species contained. Artificial infrastructures (ruin, concrete pylons, walls and rock piles) should be utilized for the creation of new habitats.|$|E

5|$|Bees {{are also}} mimicked by {{plants such as}} the bee <b>orchid</b> which imitates both the {{appearance}} and the scent of a female bee; male bees attempt to mate (pseudocopulation) with the furry lip of the flower, thus pollinating it.|$|E
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand.

5|$|Green-flowered helleborine {{is found}} {{on the western side}} of the gorge, in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods. lady <b>orchid</b> was {{discovered}} here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley {{on the west side of}} the Gorge; there is some doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. fly <b>orchid</b> and bee <b>orchid</b> are found in the gorge, along with their hybrid. A single plant of lesser meadow-rue is present in the gorge. Bristol rock-cress occurs here, and at nearby Penpole Point; in the gorge, there are about 3,000 plants on the Bristol side, and about 2,000 below Leigh Woods. Hutchinsia is found on both sides of the gorge. Bloody crane's-bill grows on the Bristol side of the gorge, where it is believed to be native. Little robin occurs on both sides of the gorge. Spiked speedwell grows on both sides of the gorge: the first British record of this plant was from the gorge, in 1641.|$|E

40|$|<b>Orchids</b> are diverse, {{occur in}} a wide range of {{habitats}} and dominate threatened species lists, but which <b>orchids</b> are threatened, where and by what? Using the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, we assessed the range and diversity of threats to <b>orchids</b> globally including identifying four threat syndromes: (1) terrestrial <b>orchids</b> in forests that are endemic to a country and threatened by illegal collecting; (2) <b>orchids</b> threatened by climate change, pollution, transportation and disturbance/development for tourism, and recreation activities, often in East Asia; (3) epiphytic <b>orchids</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa including Madagascar with diverse threats; and (4) South and Southeast Asia <b>orchids</b> threatened by land clearing for shifting agriculture. Despite limitations in the Red List data, the results highlight how conservation efforts can focus on clusters of co-occurring threats in regions while remaining aware of the trifecta of broad threats from plant collecting, land clearing and climate change.

30|$|So long as {{climate change}} {{does not make}} {{conditions}} unsuitable for species, conserving the habitats where <b>orchids</b> and, for epiphytes, their host trees grow {{should be treated as}} the highest priority, and some countries have established reserves specifically for <b>orchids</b> (see, e.g., Cribb et al. 2003).

5|$|Some plants {{reportedly}} rely {{on using}} intoxicating chemicals to produce inebriated bees, and use this inebriation {{as part of}} their reproductive strategy. One plant that some claim uses this mechanism is the South American bucket <b>orchid</b> (Coryanthes sp.), an epiphyte. The bucket <b>orchid</b> attracts male euglossine bees with its scent, derived from a variety of aromatic compounds. The bees store these compounds in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the scent (or derivatives thereof) in order to attract females.|$|E
