5|$|However, Ober Ost, the German {{military}} administration, {{rejected the}} changes. On January 26, {{in compliance with}} the earlier request, the two versions of the notification were approved, but they did not include the changes of January 8. The texts were prepared based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> of December 11. These concessions to the Germans created tensions among the council members. Four members – Mykolas Biržiška, Steponas Kairys, Stanisław Narutowicz and Jonas Vileišis – resigned from the Council in protest. Chairman Antanas Smetona, who supported the Act of December 11, stepped down. Jonas Basanavičius, who would later be called the patriarch of independence, was elected chairman.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, {{three years}} after Malaya's independence, the Emergency was {{declared}} over. However, the Malayan Internal Security Act 1960 ("ISA") was passed {{in place of the}} PPSO with much of the same powers. During parliamentary debates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Act,</b> Malayan Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman stated that the ISA would only be applied against only the remaining Communist insurgents.

5|$|Cartledge {{pursued the}} claim anyway {{in an attempt}} to have the law changed, and {{decisions}} were made against him in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal. After the Court of Appeal decision a Committee on Limitation of Actions in Cases of Personal Injury was created under Mr Justice Davies, which produced its report before the Cartledge case had even got to the House of Lords. The report, published in September 1962, made several recommendations which found their way into a Limitation Bill placed before Parliament on 6 May 1963. While it was passing through the House of Lords, Lord Reid suggested it would be simpler to amend the Limitation Act 1939, but this was never acted <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> <b>act</b> received the Royal Assent on 31 July 1963 and came into force immediately.|$|E

25|$|In Congressional debate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Act,</b> critics {{charged that}} the law would create {{unnecessary}} regulatory burdens.

25|$|Another {{danger of}} {{codification}} {{lies in the}} uncertainty of interpretation of the statute in question.

This is parallel to several AP Tests eliminating the penalties for incorrect answers. To improve the result, students can retake the test: 55% of students who retake the ACT improve their scores, 22% score the same, and 23% see their scores decrease.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} slavery in the new territories was {{seemingly}} settled by the Compromise of 1850, brokered by Whig Henry Clay and Democrat Stephen Douglas; the Compromise included the admission of California as a free state in exchange for no federal restrictions on slavery placed on Utah or New Mexico. The point of contention was the Fugitive Slave Act, which increased federal enforcement and required even free states to cooperate in turning over fugitive slaves to their owners.
