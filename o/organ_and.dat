5|$|Furthermore, {{the work}} has two large concerto {{movements}} for <b>organ</b> <b>and</b> orchestra, probably from a lost concerto for keyboard, oboe or violin, perhaps indicating that the cantata was composed for a seasonal choral absentia at Thomaskirche.

5|$|Grasshoppers may be {{confused}} with Ensifera (crickets, etc.), but they differ in many aspects; these include the number of segments in their antennae {{and the structure of}} the ovipositor, as well as the location of the tympanal <b>organ</b> <b>and</b> the methods by which sound is produced. Ensiferans have antennae that can be much longer than the body and have at least 20–24 segments, while caeliferans have fewer segments in their shorter, stouter antennae.|$|E
5|$|Great feats {{were made}} during the third century in both the {{digestive}} and reproductive systems. Herophilus was able to discover and describe not only the salivary glands, but the small intestine and liver.

40|$|Although {{previous}} {{recommendations for}} preventing transmission of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) through transplantation of human tissue <b>and</b> <b>organs</b> have markedly reduced the risk {{for this type of}} transmission, a case of HIV transmission from a screened, antibody-negative donor to several recipients raised questions about the need for additional federal oversight of transplantation of <b>organs</b> <b>and</b> tissues. A working group formed by the Public Health Service (PHS) in 1991 to address these issues concluded that further recommendations should be made to reduce the already low risk of HIV transmission by transplantation of <b>organs</b> <b>and</b> tissues. In revising these recommendations, the PHS sought assistance from public and private health professionals and representatives of transplant, public health, and other organizations. The revised guidelines address issues such as donor screening, testing, and exclusionary criteria; quarantine of tissue from living donors; inactivation or elimination of infectious organisms in <b>organs</b> <b>and</b> tissues before transplantation; timely detection, reporting, and tracking of potentially infected tissues, <b>organs,</b> <b>and</b> recipients; and recall of stored tissues from donors found after donation to have been infected. Factors considered in the development of these guidelines include differences between the screening of living and cadaveric donors; time constraints due to organ/tissue viability that may preclude performing certain screening procedures; differences in the risk of HIV transmission from various <b>organs</b> <b>and</b> tissues; differences between systems for procuring <b>and</b> distributing <b>organs</b> <b>and</b> tissues; the effect of screening practices on the limited availability of <b>organs</b> <b>and</b> some tissues; and the benefit of the transplant to the recipient.
