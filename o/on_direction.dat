5|$|After the 2004 {{release of}} , Powderfinger took a hiatus, and several members {{played in the}} side {{projects}} Drag and The Predators. Fanning decided to work independently and acted <b>on</b> <b>direction</b> he felt unable to explore {{as a member of}} Powderfinger. Some of his inspiration was derived from a will {{to see if he was}} capable of recording a solo album, considering what he viewed as his limited guitar playing abilities; compared to bandmates Darren Middleton and Ian Haug. The distance from the band, coupled with the more relaxed writing process for Tea & Sympathy helped Fanning to unwind from the stress left over from 10 years working recording and touring with Powderfinger.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over three months at Signature Sound in San Diego. During the sessions, MCA executives pressured the band {{to retain the}} sound that helped their previous album sell millions. As such, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket continues the pop punk sound that the group honed and made famous, albeit with a heavier tone inspired by groups such as Fugazi and Refused. Regarding lyrics, the album {{has been referred to}} as a concept album chronicling adolescence, with songs dedicated to first dates, fighting authority and teenage parties. Due to differing opinions <b>on</b> <b>direction,</b> the trio worked in opposition to one another for the first time, and the sessions sometimes became contentious.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the festival Cosima received a long, critical memorandum from an unknown observer, which highlighted numerous divergences from Wagner's directions. This, says Marek, proved to be a critical factor in determining her future life's mission: the maintenance of Wagner's heritage creations through the preservation of his interpretations. In her seclusion, Cosima learned of an abortive plan masterminded by Julius Kniese, the festival's chorus-master, by which Liszt was to assume the role of music director and Bülow would be chief conductor. Neither Liszt nor Bülow was interested in this arrangement, and the plan died. With Groß's assistance, Cosima pre-empted any further attempts by outsiders to assume control of the Wagner legacy, by obtaining legal recognition of herself and Siegfried as sole heirs to all Wagner's property, physical and intellectual. By this means she secured an unassailable advantage over any other claim <b>on</b> <b>direction</b> of the festival's future.|$|E

5|$|Dar was disqualified on 28 July 2017 by the Supreme Court of Pakistan to {{hold the}} office of Ministry of Finance after then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was also disqualified by the court {{following}} Panama Papers case decision. On the same day, he had ceased to hold ministerial office when the federal cabinet was disbanded after Nawaz Sharif resigned as Prime Minister. Following the election of Shahid Khaqan Abbasi as new Prime Minister in early August 2017, Dar {{was inducted into the}} federal cabinet of Abbasi despite his disqualification and an investigation was ordered against him by the Supreme Court and was re-appointed as the Minister for Finance for the fourth time After assuming the office of Prime Minister, Abbasi divided the Finance Ministry into separate entities thus minimizing the role of Dar in the federal government affairs. On 11 August 2017, he was removed as chairman of Economic Coordination Committee by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi. On 20 August 2017, he was removed from the chairmanship of some 35 National Assembly committees by Shahid Khaqan Abbasi thus further reducing Dar's influence. Pakistan Today reported that the reason of confining Dar to Ministry of Finance only is <b>on</b> <b>direction</b> of the Sharif family. In September 2017, a NAB court in Pakistan indicted Dar in Panama Papers corruption case.|$|E

25|$|Glossop had {{orders to}} {{ascertain}} {{the status of the}} transmission station, and left with Sydney to do so, after sending a boat with Buresks crew to Emden with some medical supplies and a message that they would return the next day. In addition to checking <b>on</b> <b>Direction</b> Island, there was also the potential that Emden and Königsberg had been operating together and that the second ship would approach to recover the attack party from the island, or go after the troop convoy; consequently, Sydney could not render assistance to Emdens survivors until such threats had passed. It was too late to make a landing <b>on</b> <b>Direction</b> Island, so the cruiser spent the night patrolling the islands, and approached the wireless station the next morning. On arrival, the Australians learned that the Germans had escaped the previous evening in a commandeered schooner. Sydney embarked the island's doctor and two assistants, then headed for North Keeling Island.|$|E

25|$|Control of the V-12 {{presented}} {{several problems}} to the designers and engineers {{due to the}} sheer size {{as well as the}} rotor layout. The pilot and co-pilot sat in the lower flight deck with a wide expanse of windows to give excellent visibility. Using conventional cyclic stick, collective lever and rudder pedals the pilots input their commands in a conventional fashion. Roll control is by differential collective pitch change on the left and right rotors, ensuring that sufficient lift is generated to prevent inadvertent sink. Yaw in the hover or low air speeds is achieved by tilting the rotor discs forward and backward deferentially depending <b>on</b> <b>direction</b> of yaw required. At higher air speeds differential rotor control is gradually supplanted by the large aerodynamic rudder on the fin. Ascent and descent are controlled by the collective lever increasing or decreasing pitch of both rotors simultaneously. Large elevators on the tailplane control fuselage attitude and provide reaction to pitching moments from the wing and variation on rotor disc angle.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of 8–9 November, Emden reached the islands, and sent a party ashore at around 06:00 to disable the {{wireless}} and cable transmission station <b>on</b> <b>Direction</b> Island. The station was able to transmit a distress call before it was shut down. Melbourne received the message, and ordered Sydney to investigate. The Australian ship arrived off Direction Island at 09:15, spotting and being spotted by Emden; both ships prepared for combat. Emden opened fire at 09:40, surprising those aboard Sydney as the range was greater than British intelligence thought Emden was capable of. The German ship scored several hits, {{but was unable to}} inflict disabling damage to the Australian cruiser before Sydney opened up with her more powerful main guns. At 11:20, von Müller ordered that the heavily damaged Emden beach on North Keeling Island. The Australian warship broke to pursue the collier , which scuttled herself, then returned to North Keeling Island at 16:00. At this point, Emdens battle ensign was still flying, and after no response to instructions to lower the ensign, Glossop ordered two salvoes shot into the beached cruiser. Sydney had orders to ascertain the status of the transmission station, but returned the next day to provide medical assistance to the Germans.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} cinema in Pakistan began in 1929, when Abdur Rashid Kardar {{set up a}} studio and {{production}} company {{under the name of}} United Players Corporation (later renamed Playart Phototone), which would become the foundation stone for the Lahore film industry. After scouting for locations, he settled for their offices to be established at Ravi Road. The dim-lit area presented with much difficulties and shootings were only possible in the day-light, but nevertheless the area had some very important landmarks like the Ravi Forest and the tombs of Mughal emperor Jahangir and his wife Noor Jahan. It is reported that the team working at the studios would commute on tangas and even lost equipment once while traveling on the bumpy roads on the horse-drawn carriage. However basic and crude their working conditions, Kardar believed in his work and in 1930 he produced the first silent film in Lahore Husn Ka Daku (Mysterious Eagle), under his studio's banner. The film had mild success at cinemas, but prominently established Lahore as a functioning film industry. Kardar vowed on not acting in any other film and instead focusing <b>on</b> <b>direction.</b> Immediately afterwards, the studio released the film Sarfarosh (Brave Heart) in 1931, with Gul Hamid playing the lead role with {{more or less the same}} cast as in the previous film. This production proved equally appealing, but was able to stir noise about the Lahore film industry. Roop Lal Shori, who was a resident of Brandreth Road in Lahore, upon hearing of Lahore's growing film industry, returned to his hometown and produced Qismat Ke Haer Pher (Life After Death) in 1932, which would firmly ground the film industry in Lahore. In 1946, Sajjad Gul set up Evernew Studios in on Multan Road. The following year, Eveready Pictures was established by J.C. Anand, which would go on to become the largest film production and distribution company in Pakistan.|$|E
