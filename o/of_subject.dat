40|$|AIM:To {{analyze the}} {{spectrum}} characteristics of hospitalized patients with lacrimal duct obstruction diseases(LDOD) {{and evaluate the}} prevalence and risk factors. METHODS: In this retrospective review, the medical data of 578 hospitalized patients(709 eyes) with LDOD, including age, gender, ethnicity, occupation, long-time living area, past surgical history, past eye-lid trauma history, ocular inflammation, nasal diseases and occlusion location were analyzed. RESULTS:The age of LDOD patients was among 6 mo～ 72 years, average 39. 7 ± 8. 42 years. Gender ratio was 1 : 1. 66 (217 : 361) between male and female. On ethnicity, 64. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects</b> were Han, 22. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects</b> were Hui, 11. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects</b> were Dongxiang, and 2. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects</b> were other minority ethnicity. On occupation, 62. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects</b> were peasants, 17. 0 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects</b> were workers, 7. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects</b> were drivers, while other occupations took 14. 4 % parts in total. On long-time living area, about 61. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects</b> lived in rural area, 23. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects</b> lived in town, and rest 15. 1 % lived in city. On past surgical history, 87. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects</b> never underwent surgery, about 10. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects</b> underwent surgery, including 1. 9 % underwent more than one time. Among all patients about 4. 0 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects</b> had past eye-lid trauma history. Occlusion mostly located in nasolacrimal duct, lacrimal duct, canalicular and punctum. CONCLUSION:The etiology of LDOD is multifactorial, has characteristics on age, gender, ethnicity, occupation, ocular inflammation, nasal diseases and other factors. A {{better understanding of the}} association between ethnicity and LDOD by epidemiology investigation may help its prevention and treatment in ethnic minority areas...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Preoperative {{knowledge}} of intrahepatic bile duct (IHD) anatomy {{is critical for}} planning liver resections, liver transplantations and complex biliary reconstructive surgery. The purpose of our study was to demonstrate the imaging features of various anatomical variants of IHD using magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) and their prevalence in our population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This observational clinical evaluation study included 224 patients who were referred for MRCP. MRCP was performed in a 1. 5 -Tesla magnet (Philips) with SSH MRCP 3 DHR and SSHMRCP rad protocol. A senior radiologist assessed the biliary passage for anatomical variations. RESULTS: The branching pattern of the right hepatic duct (RHD) was typical in 55. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects.</b> The most common variant was right posterior sectoral duct (RPSD) draining into the left hepatic duct (LHD) in 27. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects.</b> Trifurcation pattern was noted in 9. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects.</b> In 4 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects,</b> RPSD was draining into the common hepatic duct (CHD) and in 0. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects</b> into the cystic duct. Other variants were noted in 2. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects.</b> In 4. 9 % of cases there was an accessory duct. The {{most common type of}} LHD branching pattern was a common trunk of segment 2 and 3 ducts joining the segment 4 duct in 67. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects.</b> In 23. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects,</b> segment 2 duct united with the common trunk of segment 3 and 4 and in 3. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects</b> segment 2, 3, and 4 ducts united together to form LHD. Other uncommon branching patterns of LHD were seen in 4. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>subjects.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Intrahepatic bile duct anatomy is complex with many common and uncommon variations. MRCP is a reliable non-invasive imaging method for demonstration of bile duct morphology, which is useful to plan complex surgeries and to prevent iatrogenic injuries...|$|R

5|$|In 1999, {{the tribe}} {{filed suit in}} the United States Court of Federal Claims, seeking $14,000,000 in damages for breach of trust by DOI.

Additionally, the tribe claimed that the Snyder Act and the National Historic Preservation Act applied in this case. The Snyder Act deals with appropriations to the BIA, and the National Historic Preservation Act discussed federal assistance for preservation programs.

5|$|In terms <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> matter, {{the story}} of Joan of Arc was not well known outside of a legend. A history dealing with Joan written by Clement L'Averdy was written in 1790 but it was {{probably}} unknown to Southey. This would serve as the major historical source of information on her until Jules Quicherat's history published during the mid-19th century. Of non-historical works, Voltaire's La Pucelle was well known but the work attacks Joan. Joan's reputation was polemical, and Joan would later {{be turned into a}} French hero with Napoleon's encouragement. Friedrich Schiller would also deal with the legend the same way in Die Jungfrau von Orleans. In terms of works relying on the general idea of a warrior woman, many such figures exited in epics: Virgil and Camilla, Tasso has Clorinda, and Spenser had Britomart. However, such females were not the central figure as a woman was unique to Southey at the time.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{agree that}} Philip campaigned in Thrace in 353 BC, {{but what exactly}} he {{achieved}} {{is a matter of}} some confusion.

Others suggest that, in a campaign whose details are essentially unknown, Philip defeated the central Thracian king, Amadokos, reducing him to the status <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> ally. Since the Maroneia and Abdera campaign took place in Amadokos's territory, it seems likely that, under either chronology, Philip campaigned against Amadokos in 353 BC.|$|E

5|$|Sam & Max Hit the Road is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game where}} the player controls {{the actions of}} Sam from a third-person perspective.

The game's puzzles have logical solutions, although a number of them have far-fetched solutions due to the game's cartoon setting. Players can set the game's cursor in a particular mode to designate how Sam interacts with the environment: Sam can walk around an area, talk to other characters, look at objects, pick them up or otherwise try to use them. The cursor's graphic changes when it is hovered over an in-game entity that Sam can interact with. When talking to another character, the player is given a choice <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> areas to discuss, depicted in a conversation tree as icons {{at the base of the}} screen.

5|$|The {{unblemished}} musculature of {{the central}} figure waving to the rescue ship {{is reminiscent of the}} Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity.

The book outlined the physical and moral conditions of different labor forces. Villermé discussed his observations made concerning workers in the cotton, wool, and silk industries. He brought attention to the treacherous working conditions, unfit for adults {{as well as the}} danger for young children working alongside the adults, and critiqued the low wages provided to workers. There was a comparison throughout the entirety of the first section between the three occupations and different locations throughout France. The second portion of the book included the topic of health as it relates to dangerous workplaces and the effects of low pay and overcrowding. and he is considered a founder of epidemiology. Villermé covered a wide array <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> matter including: children in the workplace, savings accounts, asylum rooms, and drunkenness among the working class.

5|$|In {{the early}} Medieval period, British kingship was not {{inherited}} {{in a direct}} line from previous kings, as {{would be the case}} in the late Middle Ages. There were instead a number of candidates for kingship, who usually needed {{to be a member of}} a particular dynasty and to claim descent from a particular ancestor. Kingship could be multi-layered and very fluid. The Pictish kings of Fortriu were probably acting as overlords of other Pictish kings for much of this period and occasionally were able to assert an overlordship over non-Pictish kings, but occasionally themselves had to acknowledge the overlordship of external rulers, both Anglian and British. Such relationships may have placed obligations to pay tribute or to supply armed forces. After a victory, sub-kings may have received rewards in return for this service. Interaction with and intermarriage into the ruling families <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> kingdoms may have opened the way to absorption of such sub-kingdoms and, although there might be later overturnings of these mergers, it is likely that a complex process by which kingship was gradually monopolised by a handful of the most powerful dynasties was taking place.|$|E
