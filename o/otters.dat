5|$|Although each {{adult and}} {{independent}} juvenile forages alone, sea <b>otters</b> tend to rest together in single-sex groups called rafts. A raft typically contains 10 to 100 animals, with male rafts being larger than female ones. The largest raft ever seen contained over 2000 sea <b>otters.</b> To keep from drifting {{out to sea}} when resting and eating, sea <b>otters</b> may wrap themselves in kelp.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, sea <b>otters</b> {{are found}} almost {{exclusively}} on the outer coasts. They can swim as close as six feet off shore along the Olympic coast. Reported sightings of sea <b>otters</b> in the San Juan Islands and Puget Sound almost always {{turn out to be}} North American river <b>otters,</b> which are commonly seen along the seashore. However, biologists have confirmed isolated sightings of sea <b>otters</b> in these areas since the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|In the Aleutian Islands, {{a massive}} and {{unexpected}} disappearance of sea <b>otters</b> {{has occurred in}} recent decades. In the 1980s, the area was home to an estimated 55,000 to 100,000 sea <b>otters,</b> but the population fell to around 6,000 animals by 2000. The most widely accepted, but still controversial, hypothesis is that killer whales have been eating the <b>otters.</b> The pattern of disappearances {{is consistent with a}} rise in predation, but there has been no direct evidence of orcas preying on sea <b>otters</b> to any significant extent.|$|E
5|$|The North American river <b>otter</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1777. The mammal {{was identified as}} a species of <b>otter</b> and has a variety of common names, including North American river <b>otter,</b> northern river <b>otter,</b> common <b>otter</b> and, simply, river <b>otter.</b> Other documented common names are American <b>otter,</b> Canada <b>otter,</b> Canadian <b>otter,</b> fish <b>otter,</b> land <b>otter,</b> nearctic river <b>otter,</b> and Prince of Wales <b>otter.</b>|$|R

5|$|River <b>otters</b> are {{renowned for}} {{their sense of}} play. Otter play mostly {{consists}} of wrestling with conspecifics. Chasing is also a common game. River <b>otters</b> rely upon play to learn survival skills such as fighting and hunting. However, playful behavior was found in only 6% of 294 observations in a study in Idaho, and was limited mostly to immature <b>otters.</b>|$|E
5|$|River <b>otters</b> often {{reside in}} beaver ponds. Encounters between <b>otters</b> and beavers are not {{necessarily}} hostile. In Idaho, <b>otters</b> and beavers were recorded in the same beaver lodge simultaneously on three separate occasions. The <b>otters</b> may compete with the American mink (Mustela vison) for resources. In Alaska, the two species living in marine environments indicate niche separation through resource partitioning, probably related to the swimming abilities of these mustelids.|$|E
5|$|The {{historic}} {{population of}} California sea <b>otters</b> {{was estimated at}} 16,000 before the fur trade began. California's sea <b>otters</b> are the descendants of a single colony of about 50 southern sea <b>otters</b> discovered near Bixby Bridge in Big Sur in 1938. Their principal range has gradually expanded and extends from Pigeon Point in San Mateo County to Santa Barbara County.|$|E
50|$|The Eurasian <b>otter</b> (Lutra lutra), {{also known}} as the European <b>otter,</b> Eurasian river <b>otter,</b> common <b>otter,</b> and Old World <b>otter,</b> is a semiaquatic mammal native to Eurasia. The most widely {{distributed}} member of the <b>otter</b> subfamily (Lutrinae) of the weasel family (Mustelidae), it is found in the waterways and coasts of Europe, many parts of Asia, and parts of northern Africa. The Eurasian <b>otter</b> has a diet mainly of fish, and is strongly territorial. It is endangered in parts of its range, but recovering in others.|$|R
50|$|In the Old World, two <b>otter</b> {{species have}} been {{primarily}} used in <b>otter</b> fishing - the European <b>otter</b> (Lutra lutra), chiefly in Europe and North Africa, and the smooth-coated <b>otter</b> (Lutrogale perspicillata), mostly in South Asia and China.|$|R
500|$|The North American river <b>otter</b> (Lontra canadensis), {{also known}} as the {{northern}} river <b>otter</b> or the common <b>otter,</b> is a semiaquatic mammal endemic to the North American continent found in and along its waterways and coasts. An adult river <b>otter</b> can weigh between [...] The river <b>otter</b> is protected and insulated by a thick, water-repellent coat of fur.|$|R
5|$|Although {{they consume}} birds, river <b>otters</b> do not feed on bird eggs.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} recognized {{as an integral part}} of the river otter's diet. <b>Otters</b> consume more aquatic insects in the summer as the populations increase and specific life stages heighten their susceptibility. Most aquatic invertebrates preyed upon by the <b>otters</b> are from the families Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), Plecoptera (stonefly nymphs), and Coleoptera (adult beetles). Invertebrates discovered within scats or digestive tracts could most likely be a secondary food item, first being consumed by the fish that are subsequently preyed upon by the <b>otters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aquatic life ties North American river <b>otters</b> almost {{exclusively}} to permanent watersheds. The river <b>otters</b> favor bog lakes with banked shores containing semiaquatic mammal burrows and lakes with beaver lodges. The <b>otters</b> avoid water bodies with gradually sloping shorelines of sand or gravel. In Maine, use of watersheds by river <b>otters</b> is negatively associated with the proportion of mixed hardwood-softwood stands in forested areas adjacent to waterways. However, it is positively associated {{with the number of}} beaver flowages, watershed length, and average shoreline diversity. In Idaho, river <b>otters</b> prefer valley habitats over mountainous terrain, and they select valley streams over valley lakes, reservoirs, and ponds. Log jams are heavily used when present. In Florida, inhabitation of North American river <b>otters</b> is lowest in freshwater marshes, intermediate in salt marshes, and highest in swamp forests. During the dry season, they will recede from the marshland and move to permanent ponds, where water is available and food is in greater supply. In Idaho and Massachusetts, ecological elements preferred for latrine sites include large conifers, points of land, beaver bank dens and lodges, isthmuses, mouths of permanent streams, or any object that protrudes from the water.|$|E

500|$|The sea <b>otter</b> is the {{heaviest}} (the giant <b>otter</b> is longer, but significantly slimmer) {{member of the}} family Mustelidae, a diverse group that includes the 13 <b>otter</b> species and terrestrial animals such as weasels, badgers, and minks. It is unique among the mustelids in not making [...] or burrows, in having no functional anal scent glands, and in being able to live its entire life without leaving the water. The only member of the genus Enhydra, the sea <b>otter</b> is so different from other mustelid species that, as recently as 1982, some scientists believed it was more closely related to the earless seals. Genetic analysis indicates the sea <b>otter</b> and its closest extant relatives, which include the African speckle-throated <b>otter,</b> European <b>otter,</b> African clawless <b>otter</b> and oriental small-clawed <b>otter,</b> shared an ancestor approximately 5 million years ago (Mya).|$|R

Anne Sofie von <b>Otter</b> is von <b>Otter's</b> daughter; former Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik von <b>Otter</b> was his grandfather.|$|R
5|$|Communication among North American river <b>otters</b> is {{accomplished}} mainly by olfactory and auditory signals. Scent marking is imperative for intergroup communication. The river otter scent-marks with feces, urine, and possibly anal sac secretions. Musk from the scent glands {{may also be}} secreted when <b>otters</b> are frightened or angry.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the USFWS {{relocated}} about 140 Californian sea <b>otters</b> to San Nicolas Island (SNI) in southern California, {{in the hope}} of establishing a reserve population should the mainland be struck by an oil spill. To the surprise of biologists, the San Nicolas sea <b>otters</b> mostly swam back to the mainland. By 2005, only 30 sea <b>otters</b> remained at San Nicolas, although they were slowly increasing as they thrived on the abundant prey around the island. The plan that authorized the translocation program had predicted the carrying capacity would be reached within five to 10 years. The spring 2016 SNI count was 104 sea <b>otters,</b> continuing a 5-year positive trend of over 12% per year.|$|E
5|$|Many {{facets of}} the {{interaction}} between sea <b>otters</b> and the human economy are not as immediately felt. Sea <b>otters</b> have been credited with contributing to the kelp harvesting industry via their well-known role in controlling sea urchin populations; kelp is used in the production of diverse food and pharmaceutical products. Although human divers harvest red sea urchins both for food and to protect the kelp, sea <b>otters</b> hunt more sea urchin species and are more consistently effective in controlling these populations. The health of the kelp forest ecosystem is significant in nurturing populations of fish, including commercially important fish species. In some areas, sea <b>otters</b> are popular tourist attractions, bringing visitors to local hotels, restaurants, and sea otter-watching expeditions.|$|E

5|$|North American river <b>otters,</b> {{like most}} predators, prey upon the most readily {{accessible}} species. Fish is a favored food among the <b>otters,</b> {{but they also}} consume various amphibians (such as salamanders and frogs), freshwater clams, mussels, snails, small turtles and crayfish. The most common fish consumed are perch, suckers, and catfish. Instances of river <b>otters</b> eating small mammals, such as mice and squirrels, and occasionally birds have been reported as well.|$|E
5|$|On occasion, {{groups of}} {{unrelated}} juveniles are observed. River <b>otters</b> living in groups hunt and travel together, {{use the same}} dens, resting sites, and latrines, and perform allogrooming. In freshwater systems, groups occur most often in autumn and during early winter. From mid-winter through the breeding season, adult females move and den alone. River <b>otters</b> are not territorial, but individual <b>otters</b> of different groups portray mutual avoidance. Home ranges of males are larger than those of females, and both sexes exhibit intra- and intersexual overlap of their domains.|$|E
5|$|<b>Otters</b> are {{the only}} marine animals {{that are capable of}} lifting and turning over rocks, which they often do with their front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into {{underwater}} mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth. Under each foreleg, sea <b>otters</b> have a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest which they use to store collected food to bring to the surface. This pouch also holds a rock that is used to break open shellfish and clams, an example of tool use. The sea <b>otters</b> eat while floating on their backs, using their forepaws to tear food apart and bring to their mouths. Marine <b>otters</b> mainly feed on crustaceans and fish.|$|E

5|$|Reintroduction of sea <b>otters</b> to British Columbia {{has led to}} a {{dramatic}} improvement in the health of coastal ecosystems, and similar changes have been observed as sea otter populations recovered in the Aleutian and Commander Islands and the Big Sur coast of California However, some kelp forest ecosystems in California have also thrived without sea <b>otters,</b> with sea urchin populations apparently controlled by other factors. The role of sea <b>otters</b> in maintaining kelp forests has been observed to be more important in areas of open coast than in more protected bays and estuaries.|$|E
5|$|River <b>otters</b> are not scavengers; {{they avoid}} {{consuming}} carrion. Northern river <b>otters</b> do not generally handle prey {{of a large}} size relative to themselves but there are occasions where they've been observed ambushing and killing adult common snapping turtles while the large turtles (which are roughly equal in average body weight to a river otter) are hibernating. Remains of the much larger American beaver {{have been found in}} otter scat in some regions, although most otter dietary studies in areas where <b>otters</b> and beaver are sympatric do not show them to be regular predators of beavers (despite the claims of fur-trappers that <b>otters</b> frequently hunt beavers) and perhaps only young beaver kits may be attacked.|$|E
