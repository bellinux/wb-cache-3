5|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} dismount the eight guns on the forecastle and quarterdeck and stow them on chocks on the deck during daylight {{to prevent them from}} being damaged by muzzle blast from the main guns. Gun trials in December 1906 proved that this was a bit more difficult than expected and the two port guns from the forecastle and the outer starboard gun from the quarterdeck were transferred to turrets' roofs, giving each turret two guns. The remaining forecastle guns and the <b>outer</b> <b>port</b> gun from the quarterdeck were removed by the end of 1907, which reduced the total to twenty-four guns. During her April–May 1915 refit the two guns from the roof of 'A' turret were reinstalled in the original positions on the starboard side of the quarterdeck. A year later, the two guns {{at the rear of the}} superstructure were removed, reducing her to twenty-two guns. Two of the quarterdeck guns were given high-angle Mark IV*C mounts for anti-aircraft duties and the two guns abreast the conning tower were removed in 1917.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{investigation found}} that a fuel pressure pipe had chafed against a metal clip, causing the pipe to leak aviation spirit. This fuel was then ignited, probably by a hot exhaust pipe. The fuel pipe would then have been burnt away, which would have caused fuel starvation to the No. 1 (<b>outer</b> <b>port)</b> engine. With the port wing on fire and both port engines out of action, the aircraft would have been increasingly difficult to control.|$|E

All production aircraft were powered by a (2,590hp/1,932kW) Centaurus V driving a 12ft 9 inch (3.89 m) diameter Rotol propeller. Tempest Mk.IIs produced during the war were intended for combat against Japan, and would have formed part of a proposed British Commonwealth long-range bomber force based on Okinawa, Tiger Force.

500|$|Some {{equipment}} {{had been}} removed when Australia was decommissioned for use in other ships, but after the November 1923 decision by the Cabinet confirming the scuttling, RAN personnel and private contractors began to remove piping and other small fittings. Between November 1923 and January 1924, £68,000 of equipment was reclaimed; over half was donated to tertiary education centres (some of which was still in use in the 1970s), while the rest was either marked for use in future warships, or sold as souvenirs. Some consideration was given to reusing Australias 12-inch guns in coastal fortifications, but this did not occur as ammunition for these weapons was no longer being manufactured by the British, {{and the cost of}} building suitable structures was excessive. It was instead decided to sink the gun turrets and spare barrels {{with the rest of the}} ship. There was also a proposal to remove Australias conning tower and install it on the Sydney Harbour foreshore; although this did not go ahead, the idea was later used when the foremast of [...] was erected as a monument at Bradleys Head.

40|$|Wave Digital Structures (WDS) are {{particularly}} interesting for applications of interactive modeling of nonlinear (NL) {{elements in the}} context of Virtual Analog modeling. NL circuits, however, often include multiple nonlinearities or multi-port nonlinearities, which cannot readily be accommodated by traditional WDS. In this work we present a novel method for modeling in the WD domain a class of multi-port NL elements that are obtained as the interconnection of linear and NL resistive bipoles. Our technique is based on a Piece-Wise Linear approximation of the individual bipoles that constitute the multi-port element. The method generalizes the existing solutions that are available in the literature as it enables the modeling of arbitrary interconnections between <b>outer</b> <b>ports</b> of the nonlinearity and individual ports of the local NL bipoles...|$|R

5000|$|Once V-MAX is {{activated}} it switches on its thrusters and activates the afterburner, it operates the field generator which covers the units entire {{body with a}} blue magnetic wave and exhausts all inactive gases via the vent in the chest region to strengthen the barrier effect of the field.

2500|$|On 22 April, the Anzac Squadron was {{reclassified}} as Task Force 44; Australia remained flagship. Australia {{returned to}} Sydney in late April {{for a week}} of repairs and maintenance, primarily to the <b>outer</b> <b>port</b> propeller shaft. Around this time, the Americans learned of an imminent Japanese invasion of Port Moresby, and on 1 May, Australia sailed with [...] to rendezvous with American forces in the Coral Sea. At 07:00 on 7 May, Rear Admiral John Gregory Crace, who was embarked aboard Australia as commander of Task Force 44, was ordered to take his ships (Australia, the cruisers Hobart and , and the destroyers , [...] and [...] ) to the Jomard Passage, and engage any Japanese ships found en route to Port Moresby, while several US carrier groups engaged a Japanese force headed for the Solomon Islands. The ships reached their patrol area around 14:00, fired {{on a group of}} eleven unidentified aircraft at maximum range with no damage dealt at 14:27, and were attacked themselves by twelve Japanese twin-engine torpedo bombers at 15:06. Australia and Chicago were able to manoeuvre out of the torpedoes' paths, and at least five aircraft were destroyed. At 15:16, nineteen Japanese heavy bombers dropped their payload on the Allied ships. Although accurate (Australia was surrounded by the spread), none of the ships were hit directly, and the only casualties (aboard Chicago) were from shrapnel. A few minutes later, the ships were attacked by another three heavy bombers, flying at a higher altitude to the first group; the bombing was much less accurate. It was later learned that the three aircraft belonged to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Although USN Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary made plans to train aircrews in naval vessel recognition in response, USAAF General George Brett refused to implement them or acknowledge that the friendly fire incident had happened. With no new orders, Crace decided to relocate his ships during the night to a point [...] from Port Moresby, to better intercept a Japanese invasion force if it came through either the Jomard Passage or the China Strait. Instructions from the American commander of the operation were still not forthcoming, and Crace was forced to rely on intercepted radio messages to track the progress of the main battle. Australia {{and the rest of the}} task force remained in their assigned area until 01:00 on 10 May, when Crace ordered them to withdraw south to Cid Harbour on Whitsunday Island; the lack of reports and intelligence concerning either the Americans or Japanese led him to conclude that both forces had withdrawn, and there was no immediate threat to Port Moresby.|$|E

"This {{is indeed}} {{of the highest}} importance," [...] D'Aubusson said, [...] "and the {{knowledge}} that it gives us may enable us to defeat an attempt, that might otherwise have proved our ruin. You see, knights, it solves the question that we were just discussing. We agreed that this long floating bridge {{that they have been}} constructing, was intended to enable them to cross the <b>outer</b> <b>port</b> and again attack St. Nicholas; and yet it seemed to us that even by night our batteries would be able to keep up such a fire on the boats, towing the head of the bridge across, as to render it well nigh impossible for them to get it over. Now you see what their plan is. With the aid of this rope, the end of which they think is firmly fixed on our side, they mean to haul the bridge across, and that so silently that they hope to be upon us almost before we have time to don our armour. We shall now be fully prepared, and need have no fear of the result." ...|$|E

Barrels of Greek fire and pitch, cauldrons for heating the latter, a store of firewood, great balls of cotton steeped in oil and turpentine, sheaves of darts, spikes on short staves, that were, after darkness fell, to be thrust in among the fallen masonry to form a chevaux-de-frise--these, and all other matters that the ingenuity of the defenders could suggest, were landed at the water gate of the fort, while the garrison was strengthened by the addition of a large number of knights.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the trade {{structure in the}} Dutch <b>Outer</b> Islands <b>ports,</b> in which the Dutch checked the volume and value of traded items in order to levy customs duty and created trade statistics in the Indonesian Archipelago outside Java and Madura. Although these ports do not include those in independent ports {{such as those in}} Aceh and Bali, the statistics contain precious information on the entire imports and exports of each port. Analyzing this set of statistics, this paper argues that the Dutch <b>Outer</b> Islands <b>ports</b> continued to export China-bound (partly Southeast Asia-bound) tropical products, such as pepper, forest products, and other kinds of local products, as well as colonial products such as coffee. On the other hand, these ports imported increasing amounts of British cotton goods after the Anglo-Dutch tariff arrangement in the 1840 s. In this way the existing China-oriented trade and the new colonial trade, linked to Western capitalism, interacted and combined with each other. This transborder network beyond the Dutch sphere of influence was a source of the strength that the regions around these ports maintained, {{in the form of a}} steady development of trade...|$|R

But D'Alencon, whom she loved as a brother, was commanded to take another band, and wait behind a butte or knowe, out of danger of arrow-shot.
