5|$|According to Christophe Jaffrelot, while Gandhi {{considered}} untouchability to {{be wrong}} and evil, he believed that caste or class are based neither on inequality nor on inferiority. Gandhi believed that individuals should freely intermarry whoever they want to, but no one should expect everyone to befriend them. Every individual regardless <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> background, stated Gandhi, {{has a right to}} choose who they welcome into their home, who they befriend and who they spend time with.|$|E

5|$|Under modern {{constitutional}} conventions, {{the sovereign}} acts {{on the advice}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> ministers. Since these ministers most often enjoy the support of parliament and obtain the passage of bills, it is improbable that they would advise the sovereign to withhold assent. Hence, in modern practice, royal assent is always granted; a refusal {{to do so would}} be appropriate only in an emergency requiring the use of the monarch's reserve powers.|$|E

5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) to one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only {{a minority of the}} children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|Although {{tickets for}} the Masters are not expensive, they are very {{difficult}} to come by. Even the practice rounds can be difficult to get into. Applications for practice round tickets have to be made nearly a year in advance and the successful applicants are chosen by random ballot. Tickets to the actual tournament are sold only to members of a patrons list, which is closed. A waiting list for the patrons list was opened in 1972 and closed in 1978. It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again. In 2008, the Masters also began allowing children (between the ages of 8 and 16) to enter on tournament days free if they are accompanied by the patron who is the owner <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> badge.|$|E

He broke with the tradition that the profile portrait of each successive monarch faced in the direction opposite to that <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> predecessor. Edward insisted that he face left (as his father had done), to show the parting in his hair. Only a handful of test coins were struck before the abdication, and all are very rare. When George VI succeeded to the throne he also faced left to maintain the tradition by suggesting that, had any further coins been minted featuring Edward's portrait, they would have shown him facing right.|$|E

5|$|Royal assent is {{sometimes}} associated with elaborate ceremonies. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the sovereign may appear personally in the House of Lords or may appoint Lords Commissioners, who announce that royal assent has been granted {{at a ceremony}} held at the Palace of Westminster for this purpose. However, royal assent is usually granted less ceremonially by letters patent. In other nations, such as Australia, the governor-general merely signs the bill. In Canada, the governor general may give assent either in person at a ceremony held in the Senate or by a written declaration notifying parliament <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> agreement to the bill.|$|E

The unrecognised state's system of government, however, remained otherwise unchanged, right down to its declared loyalty to Elizabeth II, which Britain did not acknowledge. This situation remained until March 1970, when Rhodesia adopted a republican system of government. In republican Rhodesia, the Prime Minister instead nominally reported to the President.|$|E
