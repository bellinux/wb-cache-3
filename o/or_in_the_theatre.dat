It was during the last months of her life that this fiery and generous woman, seeing the soft hearts of her own children, looked with envy on a certain natural son of her husband's destined to become famous in the sequel as the Bastard of Orleans, or the brave Dunois. [...] "YOU WERE STOLEN FROM ME," [...] she said; [...] "it is you who are fit to avenge your father." [...] These are not the words of ordinary mourning, or of an ordinary woman. It is a saying, over which Balzac would have rubbed his episcopal hands. That the child who was to avenge her husband had not been born out of her body, was a thing intolerable to Valentina of Milan; and the expression of this singular and tragic jealousy is preserved to us by a rare chance, in such straightforward and vivid words as we are accustomed to hear only on the stress of actual life, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theatre.</b> In history - where we see things as in a glass darkly, and the fashion of former times is brought before us, deplorably adulterated and defaced, fitted to very vague and pompous words, and strained through many men's minds of everything personal or precise - this speech of the widowed duchess startles a reader, somewhat as the footprint startled Robinson Crusoe. A human voice breaks in upon the silence of the study, and the student is aware of a fellow-creature in his world of documents. With such a clue in hand, one may imagine how this wounded lioness would spur and exasperate the resentment of her children, and what would be the last words of counsel and command she left behind her.|$|E

50|$|He {{then worked}} closely with the {{designer}} Hein Heckroth and the composer Frederick Cohen to build the piece. Jooss, in fact, advocated a form of dance-theatre in which the choreography is dramatic and develops from a libretto (often his own). Choreographer, composer, and designer combine their efforts to produce a coherent work in which all the elements, in harmony with each other, convey the feelings and ideas more powerfully. This concept of a unified work of art, previously theorized by Richard Wagner and, in the 18th century, by Jean-Georges Noverre, was popular among German artists in the early 20th century. Examples are found in the visual arts, for instance in the work of George Grosz and the Herzfelde brothers, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theatre</b> of Erwin Piscator and his dramaturgical collective.|$|E

50|$|A {{paradigmatic}} {{example of}} the style that developed in that period in architecture is Palazzo Venezia, started in 1455, that incorporating existing buildings. The courtyard of the annexed Palazzetto is taken from Roman elements combined, but without philological rigor. It incorporates {{the model of the}} viridarium and is inspired by the Colosseum in the overlapped architectural orders, and in the cornice with ornament in brackets. The width of the arches, however, is reduced and simplified so they will not look too impressive compared to the spaces they enclose. In the building itself (built from 1466), there was a more faithful revival of ancient models, which shows a gradually deeper understanding. For example, the hall was once a lacunar in concrete (taken from Pantheon or the Basilica of Maxentius) with overlapping orders and partially leaning on the pillars, as in the Colosseum <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Theatre</b> of Marcellus.|$|E
40|$|MA (Communication Studies), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The primary {{research}} strategy {{of this study}} was to elicit meaningful answers from viewers by means of a focus-group procedure; this is a method associated with qualitative research (see Creswell, 1998; Berg & Lune, 2011) The group consisted of ten adults, whose visual literacy in terms of narrative films, was described as high (they frequently watch films at home, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theatre).</b> The researcher acted as the moderator; and a set of semi-structured questions, based on meanings attached to camera-angle codes as defined by Mascelli, were answered by the participants. The codification scheme of Mascelli was applied to the unconventional camera angles in Avatar and The English Patient. These were compared with the viewers’ responses. Finally, the results were interpreted, in order to establish whether a meaningful relationship exists between the viewers’ responses and the interpretation of unconventional camera angles by such a seminal figure as Joseph V. Mascelli. The literature study focused on a media aesthetic explanation of cinematography, which included media aesthetics theory, framing, and composition, as well as the general codes and conventions relevant to cinematography. The literature overview includes a study of books, academic articles, internet sources, legislation, and training videos. A Nexus and EbscoHost search (Academic Search Premier and Jstor) was conducted on cinematography in general, and on camera angles in particular. Chapter 5 indicates the viewers’ overall interpretations of the unconventional camera angles used in Avatar and The English Patient. The graphs in Chapter 5 indicate that the viewers found the unconventional camera angles used in the films to represent the meaning of the shots appropriately, and that they understood why each unconventional camera angle had been used. The viewers’ responses correspond with the meanings of the unconventional camera angles, as stated by Mascelli. To ensure the effectiveness of a film and the accurate representation of the meanings of camera angles and camera sizes, the way it is described by Mascelli should ideally be taken into consideration by all future producers. Mascelli’s descriptions of camera angles and camera sizes, combined with the media aesthetics, as described by Zettl – when successfully applied – could lead to the production of a good quality film and images within the film.

Hinting {{that this might be}} a joint Anglo-Soviet operation, the idea was again put to the JPS, who stated that they were averse to the proposal because of the large naval and air commitment required.

40|$|Courses at the University of Adelaide, {{like many}} universities, are {{predominantly}} designed around on-campus participation. This makes participation in our courses difficult for many capable students, particularly mature age, remote students and workforce participants. <b>In</b> addition, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current Australian situation where quality child and respite care {{is difficult to}} access, particularly on a casual basis, this mode of delivery also makes participation by carers difficult. Looking toward the future, the trend towards working during study is increasing and flexible participation in mixed-mode (face-to-face and on-line) courses is becoming increasingly important as {{even when it is}} possible to travel to the University, it is not always desirable to the busy professional who is reluctant to waste precious and expensive time through travel. Providing options for students to participate from remote locations also benefits students who may be injured, elite athletes, those traveling, etc. and provides a safety net for providing continuity of education during epidemics or other crisis that may prevent the use of existing buildings or large gatherings. The typical approach to accommodating the needs of such students, if they are accommodated at all, is to record faceto-face activities for later review or to provide an entirely on-line version of a course. Several studies also show that students prefer live lectures (Rowe, Harley et al. 2001; Hagel and Shaw 2007; Acharya 2003). There is also evidence that face-to-face discussion is more effective than asynchronous approaches such as discussion boards for many of the types of activities and skills needed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> maths, sciences and computing (Parker and Gemino 2001). Recording and replaying face-to-face activities is beneficial for review, but excludes students from actively engaging <b>in</b> face-to-face discussions. <b>The</b> lack of interaction with classmates can also negatively impact on a students’ engagement. Providing support for active participation by remote students combines the location flexibility of on-line learning with the social learning benefits of the large, on-campus, face-to-face cohort. This talk presents findings from a pilot study of three classes (approximately 150 students total) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second semester of 2009. The Wimba virtual classroom (Wimba 2009) was used to integrate remote students into live learning activities. Participation was voluntary and students were able to attend lectures and tutorials through Wimba <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lecture <b>theatre</b> <b>or</b> both. A Likert scale questionnaire and free answer questions were distributed before and after the trial to study the perceptions of both students and staff members on the need and desirability of such integration. The trials indicate that there is still a mismatch between the desires of students who {{want to be able to}} participate remotely and the technical and pedagogical challenges to providing the facility.

Complete success was defined as maintenance of intraocular pressure (IOP) ≥ 6 mm Hg and ≤ 21 mm Hg, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of further surgery or use of antiglaucoma medication. Qualified success met the above criteria with or without use of antiglaucoma medications. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-five eyes completed the two-year follow up. Sixty-nine percent of participants had POAG and 31 % had PACG. The mean interval between filtering surgery and bleb needling was 299. 9 ± 616. 4 d for POAG and 167. 1 ± 272. 2 d for PACG. Mean needling attempts were 1. 9 ± 1. 4 and 2 ± 1. 6 for POAG and PACG respectively. In general, there was a statistically significant reduction of IOP ranging from 21. 9 % to 26. 8 % from month 1 through to month 24. The complete success rates at month 6 were 70. 0 % for POAG and 65. 7 % for PACG. At month 12, this decreased to 62. 2 % for POAG and PACG and at month 24, 57. 9 % for POAG and 63. 0 % for PACG respectively. The qualified success rates at month 6 for POAG and PACG were 23. 8 % and 29. 9 % respectively, 32. 2 % and 29. 2 % at month 12, and 34. 7 % and 29. 6 % at month 24. The success rates between POAG and PACG {{were not significantly different}} (P > 0. 05 for complete and qualified success at months 6, 12 and 24). An increased number of needlings and higher pre-needling IOP were associated with failure. CONCLUSION: The 5 -FU augmented bleb needling within one year of trabeculectomy in Asian eyes can provide clinically significant IOP lowering of more than 20 % for 2 y. POAG and PACG had similar complete success rates (58 % and 63 % respectively). Factors associated with greater risk of procedure failure included increased number of needlings and higher pre-needling IOP. Asian eyes have a greater propensity for scarring but bleb needling, if performed in a timely manner can rescue bleb function...|$|R

S 20 godina došao je u Zagreb Vatroslavu Lisinskom. I praizvedba opere Ljubav i zloba 28. ožujka 1846. označila je početak velike karijere umjetnika koji nije potekao iz Hrvatske, ni podrijetlom ni rodom, ali jest oblikovanjem svoje umjetničke ličnosti prvog profesionalnog hrvatskog opernog pjevača. Stazić je počeo profesionalnu karijeru u Pešti, nastavio u Pragu, a od 1853. bio je član Dvorske opere u Beču i njezin veliki prvak, i to je ostao do 1871., s većim ili manjim prekidima, kao stalni član ili gost. Svojim krasnim glasom sjaja i snage herojskog tenora s briljantnim visinama, sigurnom pjevačkom tehnikom i sugestivnom interpretacijom, s lakoćom je svladavao vrlo širok i raznolik repertoar. Intonacija mu je bila čista, dikcija uzorna, pjevačka inteligencija razvijena. U Zagrebu je 1858. pjevao u Ernaniju, Trubaduru i Luciji di Lammermoor. Gostovao je u mnogim velikim europskim kazalištima, prvi je hrvatski pjevač koji je nastupio u Scali. Godine 1874. povukao se sa scene. Umro je u Szentendreu 1. ožujka 1911. godine. Franz Steger, {{whose name}} Dimitrija Demeter Croatianised into Franjo Stazić (for the German der Steg is {{translated}} as staza in Croatian and in English as pathway), {{was born on}} December 3, 1824 in Szentendre (Hungary). At the age of 20 he came to Zagreb and to Vatroslav Lisinski. The first-ever performance of the first Croatian opera Love and Malice by Lisinski, on March 28, 1846, {{marked the beginning of}} the great career of the first professional Croatian opera singer, Franjo Stazić. He had in fact already made his debut on January 10, 1846, as Edgardo in Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor. Stazić left for Vienna, where he began to perform in public and to learn singing professionally. Subsequently he went to Pest and changed his name to Ferenc Stéger, or, as later cited, Xavér Ferenc Stéger. From 1848 until 1874, when he retired from the stage, he made regular appearances in Budapest, either as guest or as a regular member of <b>the</b> company, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National <b>Theatre</b> there <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> German <b>Theatre.</b> After four years he went to Prague, where he became František Steger. In 1853, now Franz Steger, he became a member and one of the principals of <b>the</b> Court Opera <b>in</b> Vienna, taking <b>the</b> most difficult roles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tenor repertoire. He remained there until 1871, either as a permanent member of the company or guest singer. With his wonderful voice that had the power and lustre of the heroic tenor, with brilliant high notes — he sang <b>the</b> high C <b>in</b> his chest voice, and with a sure vocal technique and suggestive interpretation he was easily able to master a very broad and diverse repertoire, from <b>the</b> lyrical Elvino <b>in</b> La Sonnambula to <b>the</b> dramatic Eleazar <b>in</b> La Juive. He was a master of all the possible embellishments, his intonation was pure, diction exemplary and vocal intelligence well developed. He was thus able to impart conviction on the stage to all his characters. In Zagreb in 1858, now with a European reputation, Stazić sang with enormous success in Ernani, Il Trovatore and Lucia di Lammermoor. He made guest appearance in many great European <b>theatres,</b> and was <b>the</b> first Croatian singer to appear at La Scala, where he was known as Francesco Steger. He died in his native Szentendre on March 1, 1911. It is clear from Stazić’s memoirs that he was of German descent; but it is also very obvious that he spoke Croatian from childhood and felt himself a Croat. Ludwig Eisenberg’s Great Biographical Lexicon of <b>the</b> German Stage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19 th century considers him a Croat and Croatia his homeland, even claiming that Stazić is his real surname...|$|R
