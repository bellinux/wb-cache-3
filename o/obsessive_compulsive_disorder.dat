25|$|A {{chromosome}} {{has been}} located in dogs that confers {{a high risk}} of susceptibility to OCD. Canine chromosome 7 {{has been found to be}} most significantly associated with <b>obsessive</b> <b>compulsive</b> <b>disorder</b> in dogs, or more specifically, canine compulsive disorder (CCD). This breakthrough helped further relate OCD in humans to CCD in canines. Canine chromosome 7 is expressed in the hippocampus of the brain, the same area that <b>Obsessive</b> <b>Compulsive</b> <b>Disorder</b> is expressed in human patients. Similar pathways are involved in drug treatment responses for both humans and dogs, offering more research that the two creatures exhibit symptoms and respond to treatment in similar ways. This data can help scientists to discover more effective and efficient ways to treat OCD in humans through the information they find by studying CCD in dogs.|$|E

40|$|The role {{of family}} in the {{development}} and treatment of <b>obsessive</b> <b>compulsive</b> disorders: The cognitive behavioral perspective. It is widely recognized that specific parental attitudes and parental style defined by high expressed emotion (Renshaw et al., 2003), overprotection, overcontrol (Alonso et al., 2004), low affection (Alonso et al., 2004) and low support (Valleni-Basile et al., 1996) can influence <b>obsessive</b> <b>compulsive</b> <b>disorders</b> in children (Waters, Barrett, 2000). It has also been underlined that the family involvement in the patient’s rituals tends to perpetuate and reinforce the child’s <b>obsessive</b> <b>compulsive</b> symptoms (Cooper, 1996; Geller, MBBS, FRACP, 2006). As a consequence, cognitive behavioural family treatment is largely suggested for these patients (Pollock, Carter, 1999). In this treatment both parents and children attend separate group sessions and some concurrent family therapy (Mendlowitz et al., 1999). Overall, the treatment literature reveals that a substantial percentage of patients remains symptomatic post-treatment (POTS, 2004). In order to improve treatment for children with <b>obsessive</b> <b>compulsive</b> <b>disorders,</b> several studies identified personal and family predictors of response to treatment (Ginsburg, Kingery, Drake, Grados, 2008; Keeley, Storch, Merlo, Geffken, 2008). Results displayed that family attitudes defined by high expressed emotion (Leonard et al., 1993), hostile criticism, emotional overinvolvement (Chambless, Steketee, 1999) and high family accommodation were associated with greater dropout and/or poor cognitive behavioural treatment outcome for children with <b>obsessive</b> <b>compulsive</b> <b>disorders</b> (Merlo, Lehmkuhl, Geffken, Storch, 2009;Van Noppen, Steketee, 2003).

25|$|Negative priming is {{identified}} {{as one of the}} cognitive process necessary for goal directed behaviors. It is associated with many cognitive processes such as inhibition, selective attention, encoding, memory retrieval, and short-term memory. Neuropsychiatric disorders may be due to problems with some of the above-mentioned areas of cognition. Currently, schizophrenia, <b>obsessive</b> <b>compulsive</b> <b>disorder,</b> and Tourette syndrome are being studied with reference to negative priming. Understanding the paradigm of negative priming can lead to the use of negative priming tasks as diagnosing tools to identify the disorders. Knowledge about the physiological basis of negative priming can also help in designing therapies or treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders.|$|E
25|$|Social anxiety {{disorder}} (SAD) and ORS have some demographic and clinical similarities. Where the social anxiety and avoidance behavior is primarily focussed on concern about body odors, ORS {{is a more}} appropriate diagnosis than avoidant personality disorder or SAD. Body dismorphic disorder (BDD) {{has been described as}} the closest diagnosis in DSM-IV to ORS as both primarily focus on bodily symptoms. The defining difference between the two is that in BDD the preoccupation is with physical appearance not body odors. Similarly, where obsessive behaviors are directly and consistently related to body odors rather than anything else, ORS is a more appropriate diagnosis than <b>obsessive</b> <b>compulsive</b> <b>disorder,</b> in which obsessions are different and multiple over time.|$|E
25|$|One {{study done}} by Simon Vermeier used neuroimaging to {{investigate}} serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in 9 dogs with Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) {{to measure the}} serotonin 2A receptor availability. When compared to the 15 non-compulsive dogs used as a control group, the dogs with CCD {{were found to have}} lower receptor availability as well as lower subcortical perfusion and hypothalamic availability. The results of this study provide evidence that there are imbalanced serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways in dogs. Similarities between other studies about human OCD provide construct validity for this study, which suggests that the research will be valid and useful in continuing to investigate brain activity and drug treatment in <b>Obsessive</b> <b>Compulsive</b> <b>Disorder.</b>|$|E

25|$|When {{compared}} to psychotropic medications, review {{studies have found}} CBT-alone to be as effective for treating less severe forms of depression and anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), tics, substance abuse (with the exception of opioid use disorder), eating disorders, and borderline personality disorder, and it is often recommended in combination with medications for treating other conditions, such as severe <b>obsessive</b> <b>compulsive</b> <b>disorder</b> (OCD) and major depressive disorder, opioid addiction, bipolar, and psychotic disorders. In addition, CBT is recommended as {{the first line of}} treatment for the majority of psychological disorders in children and adolescents, including aggression and conduct disorder. Researchers have found that other bona fide therapeutic interventions were equally effective for treating certain conditions in adults, but CBT was found to be superior in treating most disorders.

25|$|Some {{treatment}} {{has been given}} to dogs with CCD to observe their reactions and how they are similar or different from how humans would react to the same pharmaceutical or behavioral treatment. A combination of the two approaches {{has been found to be}} most effective in lowering the intensity and regularity of OCD in both canines and humans. Pharmaceutically, clomipramine was found to be more effective than an alternative chemical, amitriptyline, in treatments for dogs. One study by Karen Overall discovered that by combining behavioral therapy with the more effective clomipramine, the symptoms of Canine Compulsive Disorder decreased by over 50% for all of the dogs involved in the study. Overall acknowledges that OCD is not something that can be completely cured, but studies like this are still important because <b>Obsessive</b> <b>Compulsive</b> <b>Disorder</b> can be controlled effectively enough so it does not interfere with one's life, a valuable and commonly sought after thing for those who suffer from the disorder.|$|E

25|$|Louis Shuster and Nicholas Dodman {{noticed that}} dogs often {{demonstrate}} obsessive and compulsive behaviors similar to humans. Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) {{is not only}} specific only to certain breeds of dogs, but the breed may affect the specific types of compulsions. For example, bull terriers frequently exhibit obsessively predatory or aggressive behaviors. Breed may factor into the types of compulsions, but some behaviors are more common across the canine spectrum. Most commonly, CCD is seen in canines as they repeat behaviors such as chasing their tails, compulsively chewing on objects, or licking their paws excessively, similar to the common hand-washing compulsion many people with <b>Obsessive</b> <b>Compulsive</b> <b>Disorder</b> have.
