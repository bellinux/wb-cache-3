5|$|Our {{understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> back to {{very early}} times {{suggests that there}} is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> continues to accelerate, there is a future horizon as well.|$|E
5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble {{observed that}} the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction. Assuming the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe),</b> the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> are receding from all others. Since {{we know that the}} distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.|$|E

5|$|An {{equilibrium}} between electrons, positrons and photons {{was maintained}} {{during this phase}} of the evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe.</b> After 15 seconds had passed, however, the temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> dropped below the threshold where electron-positron formation could occur.

5|$|An {{important}} parameter {{determining the}} future evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> theory is the density parameter, Omega (Ω), {{defined as the}} average matter density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> divided by a critical value of that density.

5|$|Before {{observations}} of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios {{for the future}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> If the mass density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> were greater than the critical density, then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state {{similar to that in}} which it started—a Big Crunch.|$|E
5|$|Before {{tools such}} as the {{telescope}} were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled, and ideas on the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> began to be explored. Most of early astronomy actually consisted of mapping {{the positions of the}} stars and planets, a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, {{and the nature of the}} Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe,</b> or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.|$|E
5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} {{on the grounds}} that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or the meaning of life. In such instances, evolution is being redefined to refer to the entire history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> and it is argued that if one aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E

5|$|From {{approximately}} 10−6 {{seconds after}} the Big Bang, during a period {{is known as the}} hadron epoch, the temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> had fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons, and the mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> was dominated by hadrons. Initially the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, which kept matter and antimatter in thermal equilibrium. However, as the temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> continued to fall, hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in particle-antiparticle annihilation reactions, leaving a small residual of hadrons by the time the Universe was about one second old.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental to the {{structure}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> is the existence of dark matter and dark energy.

5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been many ideas of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies). Theories of an impersonal Universe governed by {{physical}} laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians. Ancient Chinese philosophy encompassed the notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> including both all of space and all of time. Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe.</b> The modern era of cosmology began with Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity, which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> as a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the predicted Big Bang.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{discovered}} that Type Ia supernovae that were considered the same are in fact different; moreover, a form of the Type Ia supernova that is relatively infrequent today was far more common earlier in the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> This could have far reaching cosmological significance and could lead to revision of estimation of the rate of expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> and the prevalence of dark energy.|$|E
