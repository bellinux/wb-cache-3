Nevertheless, this approach can only be justified in countries with a relatively low incidence of serogroup C meningococcal disease in the first year of life. Furthermore, a good surveillance programme is recommended for timely detection of vaccine breakthroughs and outbreaks among non-vaccinees, since long-term protection after a single dose in the second year of life cannot currently be guaranteed. </p...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Antibodies against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and {{serogroup}} C Neisseria meningitidis (MenC) wane after early infant immunization. METHODS: Children previously immunized in {{a randomized}} controlled trial at ages 2, 3, and 4 months with DTPa-IPV-Hib and MenC-CRM 197 (MenC-CRM group) or DTPa-IPV and Hib-MenC-TT (Hib-MenC-TT group) had blood samples drawn at 1 and 2 years following a booster dose of Hib-MenC-TT at 12 to 15 months of age. A blood sample was also drawn at the year 2 follow-up from a separately recruited age-matched control group {{who had not}} received a booster. RESULTS: In 271 children at year 1, mean 14. 6 months (range: 12 - 18 months) following the Hib-MenC-TT booster, MenC bactericidal titers above the protective threshold (rSBA ≥ 1 : 8) was demonstrated in 89. 0 % of the Hib-MenC-TT group and 69. 5 % of MenC-CRM participants. Antipolyribosylribitol phosphate Ig ≥ 1. 0 μg/mL (Hib correlate for long-term protection) was seen in 94. 9 % and 82. 5 %, respectively. In 379 participants (including 72 control children) at year 2 (age: 39 - 43 months, 25 - 31 months post Hib-MenC-TT) persistence <b>of</b> <b>MenC</b> antibodies was demonstrated in 67. 1 % of the Hib-MenC-TT group and 40. 5 % of the MenC-CRM group, compared with 44. 1 % of control group participants.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the serogroup C meningococcal (MenC) conjugate vaccination has successfully controlled the burden of disease associated with this serogroup in many countries. However, considerable inter-individual variation is observed in immune responses to MenC vaccine, and little is understood of the determinants of this variability. Previously, we reported an association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR 3 and CD 44 and the persistence <b>of</b> <b>MenC</b> vaccine immunity. Here we further examine polymorphisms within these two candidate genes and immune responses to MenC vaccine. MenC-specific IgG concentrations and serum bactericidal assay (SBA) titres were measured one month after a primary course <b>of</b> <b>MenC</b> vaccination in 318 human infants. Tagging SNPs (TagSNPs) within TLR 3 and CD 44 were genotyped and regional imputations carried out to screen these genes for variations associated with immunological responses to MenC vaccine.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In Australia, {{following}} {{the introduction of}} serogroup C meningococcal (MenC) conjugate vaccine for toddlers and catch-up immunization through adolescence, MenC disease incidence plummeted and remains low. However, individual protection following MenC conjugate vaccination, particularly in young children, may be short-lived. We investigated the persistence <b>of</b> <b>MenC</b> serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) titers in adolescents, more than 7 years after a single "catch-up" dose <b>of</b> <b>MenC</b> conjugate vaccine. We also investigated their exposure and susceptibility to meningococcal serogroups A, W and Y. METHODS: MenC SBA titers and Men A, C, W and Y IgG geometric mean concentration were measured in 240 healthy 11 - to 16 -year-old adolescents. The correlate of protection was an rSBA titer of ≥ 8. RESULTS: An rSBA≥ 8 was observed in 105 [44 % (95 % confidence interval {CI}, 37 - 50 %) ] of 240 adolescents (mean age, 13. 2 years, mean interval since MenC immunization, 8. 2 years). The proportion with an rSBA≥ 8, geometric mean rSBA titer and geometric mean IgG concentration increased with age, from 22 % to 75 %, 3. 7 to 33. 4 and 0. 13 to 0. 52 μg/mL, in participants who received MenC vaccine at mean age 2. 8 to 7. 5 years, respectively.

40|$|Background: Bactericidal {{antibody}} {{induced by}} immunization of infants with serogroup C Neisseria meningitidis (MenC) vaccines wanes rapidly during childhood. Adolescents are at particular risk from meningococcal disease, therefore they {{might benefit from}} a booster dose of vaccine. The duration of serologic response to such a booster in adolescents is unknown. Methods: In a previous study, English schoolchildren, aged 9 to 12 years, who had received a monovalent MenC glycoconjugate vaccine in 1999 - 2000, were given either a plain polysaccharide vaccine (MenC-PS group, n = 150) or a glycoconjugate vaccine (MenC-CRM group, n = 95) at 13 to 15 years of age. In this follow-up study, serum bactericidal antibody titers and specific immunoglobulin G concentrations were assessed 1 year later. Results were compared with unboosted controls of similar age (control group, n = 298). Results: Compliance with study protocol was achieved for 146 of the MenC-PS group, 92 of the MenC-CRM group, and 293 of the control group. Compared with the control group, both the MenC-PS and MenC-CRM groups had a significantly higher (P < 0. 0001) geometric mean serum bactericidal antibody titers 1 year after the booster dose (geometric mean titers for MenC-PS group 3388 [95 % confidence interval {CI}: 2460 - 4665]; MenC-CRM group 4417 [95 % CI: 2951 - 6609]; control group 316 [95 % CI: 252 - 396]). Specific immunoglobulin G concentration also rose and remained elevated 1 year after the booster. Conclusions: A booster dose <b>of</b> <b>MenC</b> vaccine given to adolescents produced a marked rise in bactericidal antibody, which remained elevated 1 year later.

40|$|Abstract Background To assess {{changes in}} the pattern of Invasive Meningococcal Disease (IMD) in Italy after the {{introduction}} <b>of</b> conjugate <b>menC</b> vaccine in the National Vaccine Plan 2005 – 2007 and to provide information for developing timely and appropriate public health interventions, analyses of microbiological features of isolates and clinical characteristics of patients have been carried out. In Italy, the number of serogroup C meningococci fell progressively following the introduction <b>of</b> the <b>MenC</b> conjugate vaccine, recommended by the Italian Ministry of Health but implemented according to different regional strategies. Methods IMD cases from January 2005 through July 2008 reported to the National Meningococcal Surveillance System were considered for this study. Serogrouping and sero/subtyping were performed on 179 serogroup C strains received at the National Reference Laboratory of the Istituto Superiore di Sanità. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was possible for 157 isolates. MLST (Multilocus sequence typing), por A VRs (Variable Region) typing, PFGE (Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis), VNTR (Variable Number Tandem Repeats) analyses were performed on all C: 2 a and C: 2 b meningococci (n = 147), following standard procedures. Results In 2005 and 2008, IMD showed an incidence of 0. 5 and 0. 3 per 100, 000 inhabitants, respectively. While the incidence due to serogroup B remained stable, IMD incidence due to serogroup C has decreased since 2006. In particular, the decrease was significant among infants. C: 2 a and C: 2 b were the main serotypes, all C: 2 a strains belonged to ST- 11 clonal complex and all C: 2 b to ST- 8 /A 4. Clinical manifestations and outcome of infections underlined more severe disease caused by C: 2 a isolates. Two clusters due to C: 2 a/ST- 11 meningococci were reported in the North of Italy in December 2007 and July 2008, respectively, with a high rate of septicaemia and fatal outcome. Conclusion Public health surveillance of serogroup C invasive meningococcal disease and microbiological/molecular characterization of the isolates requires particular attention, since the hyper-invasive ST- 11 predominantly affected adolescents and young adults for whom meningococcal vaccination was not recommended in the 2005 – 2007 National Vaccine Plan. </p...|$|R
40|$|The National Executive Board of Music Educators National Conference {{adopted the}} {{following}} goals for MENC at its July meeting in 1984. 1. By 1990, every student, K- 12, shall {{have access to}} music instruction in school. 2. By 1990, every high school require at least one Carnegie unit of credit in the arts for graduation. 3. By 1990, every college and University shall require at least one Carnegie unit of credit in the arts for admission. MENC President Paul R. Lehman commented that, "I believed that these goals are reasonable and, in most schools, achievable. " He called the first goal "the essence <b>of</b> <b>MENC's</b> agenda" and vowed that MENC would pursue that objective vigorously and persitently. "We {{can take advantage of}} the nations current enthusiasm for excellence to make dramatic progress toward these goals," he said, but warned that the goals impose special responsibilities on music educators. As is generally known, the Crisis in Music Education in the United States happened in 1981. For the sake of the federal government budget cuts signed into law by President Regan in the August, hundreds of music education position have been eliminated. The cuts affected school budgets and when school budgets are cut, music program and personnel used to be often one of the first to be proposed for curtailment or elimination. In the preceding treatise, an overview of the music curricula innovation movements of the United States was presented. As the conclusion of the study, writer could condense the basic idea of the music curricula innovation movements to such slogan "Music for every child, every child for music. " In this treatise, concerning the realization of the slogan, this writer tried to explain the American music educators activities and endeavors under the previously stated crisis in music education. Second, in addition, the ideas and methods which have been supporting American music educators were examined. To put it concretely, the ideas and methods are embodied in the so-called Comprehensive music program and General music program. We can say the both, CMP and GMP, are the products of the Curriculum Innovations of Music Education in the United States of America...|$|R

A cross-sectional {{study was conducted}} to assess the preva-lence of meningococci carriage among workers at both refin-eries and to investigate the effect of vaccination on and the risk factors for pharyngeal carriage of meningococci. Among the vaccinated and nonvaccinated workers, rates of over-all meningococci carriage (21. 4 % and 21. 6 %, respectively) and <b>of</b> <b>MenC</b> carriage (6. 3 % and 4. 9 %, respectively) were similar. However, a MenC strain belonging to the sequence type 103 complex predominated and was responsible for the increased incidence of meningococcal disease in Brazil. A low education level was associated with higher risk of me-ningococci carriage. Polysaccharide vaccination did not af-fect carriage or interrupt transmission of the epidemic strain...|$|E
40|$|Rapid waning of anti-polysaccharide {{bactericidal}} Ab and vaccine {{effectiveness is}} observed following infant immunization with the serogroup C meningococcal (MenC) glycoconjugate vaccine. This is despite the demonstrable presence of immunological memory. Persistence of functional Ab, therefore, {{appears to be}} the key determinant <b>of</b> <b>MenC</b> conjugate vaccine effectiveness. Ab persistence is thought to depend in the short term on the survival of plasma cells generated during priming and in the longer term on the production of new Ab secreting cells from memory B cells. In this study, we found a strong association between the level of MenC-specific Ab and the frequency of memory B cells measured at 5 mo of age (1 mo after 3 -dose primary immunization with MenC conjugate vaccine), and the persistence of functional Ab at one year of age. These findings suggest that these two parameters are good markers of B cell responses to priming and can be used as predictors of long term humoral immunity induced by glycoconjugate vaccines received in early infancy...|$|E

Collective observations regarding ligands that cleanly produce [M(S 2 C 2 Ph 2) Ln], do not react at all, or lead to ill-defined decomposition identify soft σ donors as the ligand type capable of dithiolene substitution. Substitution <b>of</b> <b>MeNC</b> from [Ni(S 2 C 2 Ph 2) (CNMe) 2] by L provides access {{to a variety of}} heteroleptic dithiolene complexes not accessible from 1. Substitution of a dithiolene ligand from 1 involves net redox disproportionation of the ligands from radical monoanions, –S•SC 2 Ph 2, to enedithiolate and dithione, the latter of which is an enhanced leaving group that is subject to further irreversible reactions...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the studies described in this thesis is {{to contribute to the}} optimization of the Dutch routine immunization schedule for MenC. The following research questions are addressed: 1. 	What is the current burden of invasive meningococcal disease in the Netherlands in terms of disease course and outcome? 2. 	Is the disease course or outcome of IMD related to meningococcal serogroup or clonal complex? 3. 	How long do MenC-specific antibody levels persist after primary MenCC vaccination? 4. 	Are the kinetics of MenC-specific antibody levels in response to primary MenCC vaccination in children with autoimmune disease different from the kinetics in healthy controls? 5. 	What would be the most appropriate age in (pre) adolescence to administer a MenCC booster vaccination and induce long-standing levels <b>of</b> sufficient <b>MenC</b> specific antibody in serum? 6. 	Does parenteral MenCC vaccination induce MenC-specific antibodies in saliva and to which extent do these levels correlate with MenC-specific antibody levels in serum? 7. 	What is the role of MenC-specific memory B cells in the persistence of MenC-specific antibody levels...|$|R
