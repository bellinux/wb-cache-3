When the visibility is good the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm in the Bristol Channel can be seen.

5|$|The Jardin des Mont du Récollets {{provides}} expansive views {{over the}} plains of Flanders and beyond; <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>day</b> {{it is possible to}} see the North Sea, the English coast and the belfry of Bruges.

Just below the gardens is the Porte du Château of 1621, the last substantial part of the old castle to remain standing. The city walls no longer stand but footpaths and streets still trace their former course.|$|E

5|$|The tower {{had four}} lifts, each capable of {{reaching}} the top in 90 seconds and conveying up to 2000 people an hour. The views from the top included the Liverpool skyline, the River Mersey estuary and the River Dee. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>day</b> visitors could see across the Irish Sea to the Isle of Man, along with views of the Lake District and Welsh Mountains. In its first year the tower attracted up to half a million visitors to the top. At night the tower was illuminated by fairy lights.|$|E
5|$|The {{view from}} the top <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>day</b> extends across {{the whole of the}} Lake District to the Solway Firth and hills of {{south-west}} Scotland to the north-west, Cheviot and the Pennine Hills to the north-east, Morecambe Bay, Blackpool and the coast of North Wales to the south, and the Irish Sea to the west. Snowdon is hidden by the Coniston Fells, and the Isle of Man is largely hidden behind the Great Gable and Pillar group of fells.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{has been}} a more {{successful}} industry in the area. For over two hundred years visitors have been drawn by the lake and mountain scenery of the Lake District, and many have {{made their way to}} the top of Helvellyn. Among the early visitors to Helvellyn were the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, both of whom lived nearby at one period. Many routes up the mountain are possible so that it may be approached from all directions. The view from the top is one of the most extensive over the Lake District, and <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>day</b> the view can also stretch from Scotland to Wales.|$|E

50|$|They {{returned}} to the wooden cross left <b>on</b> <b>a</b> hill the year before, and this time (perhaps <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>day)</b> realized that the site did indeed overlook the place Vizcaíno had described. Portolá founded the Presidio of Monterey on that hill, and Serra founded the Mission San Carlos Borromeo (moved to Carmel the next year, a little ways to the south). On July 9, 1770, Portolá and Costansó boarded the San Antonio and sailed out of Monterey Bay, headed back to Mexico.|$|R
5|$|As well as passengers, Nairana {{regularly}} carried cargo, including gold bullion, {{and live}} {{animals such as}} horses and cattle between Tasmania and the mainland. A Tasmanian devil being transported to Melbourne Zoo in a wooden crate placed {{in one of the}} ship's four horse stalls escaped by chewing a hole through its box, and was never seen again. In 1934, her code letters were changed to VJGY. Nairana was withdrawn from service in December 1935 {{as a result of a}} ship workers' strike, returning to the Bass Strait run in the new year. As she neared Port Phillip Bay on 12 April 1936, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>day</b> with apparently calm seas, she was again struck by a rogue wave and rolled onto her port side before swinging back over to starboard and eventually righting. The impact injured most of her 88 passengers and killed four, including a family of three who disappeared after being swept overboard. Despite this, she proceeded to her berth in the Yarra River, having sustained only minor damage.|$|E

Access to the beach is through a {{footpath}} next the caravan and camp-site. This beach is ideal for days when the wind is from the north or north west due to the sheltered bay.|$|R

50|$|The views {{over the}} Mozambique plain are spectacular. Theoretically, with a {{telescope}} it should just {{be possible to}} see the Indian Ocean from the peak of Binga <b>on</b> <b>a</b> very <b>clear</b> <b>day</b> looking along <b>an</b> easterly bearing, at a range of 190 kilometres.

50|$|Just {{like the}} Garth Mountain {{a mile or}} so away, the Wenallt Mountain can be seen over most of the Cardiff city centre, and <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sunny <b>clear</b> <b>day</b> can also be seen as far away as Weston-super-Mare, which is some {{eighteen}} miles away over the Bristol Channel in the southwest of England.|$|R
