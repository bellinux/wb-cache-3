5|$|The {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> on {{the surface}} suggests that Titania may have a tenuous seasonal atmosphere of CO2, much {{like that of the}} Jovian moon Callisto. Other gases, like nitrogen or methane, are unlikely to be present, because Titania's weak gravity could not prevent them from escaping into space. At the maximum temperature attainable during Titania's summer solstice (89 K), the vapor pressure <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> is about 300 μPa (3 nbar).|$|E

5|$|The {{peculiar}} {{geometry of}} the Uranian system causes the moons' poles to receive more solar energy than their equatorial regions. Because the vapor pressure of CO2 is a steep function of temperature, this {{may lead to the}} accumulation <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> in the low-latitude regions of Titania, where it can stably exist on high albedo patches and shaded regions of the surface in the form of ice. During the summer, when the polar temperatures reach as high as 85–90 K, carbon dioxide sublimates and migrates to the opposite pole and to the equatorial regions, giving rise to a type of carbon cycle. The accumulated carbon dioxide ice can be removed from cold traps by magnetospheric particles, which sputter it from the surface.

Analysis of the carbon-13 isotope in the carbon dioxide gas emissions suggest a magmatic origin. This has led to the possibility of a volcanic geothermal system, the existence of which has been investigated by Geoscience BC as part of their Targeting Resources for Exploration and Knowledge project. The lack of hot springs and geothermal evidence on the surface suggest that the heat source of such a system would be very deep underground.|$|E
