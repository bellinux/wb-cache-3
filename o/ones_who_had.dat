He {{has been described as}} the leader of the Bomber Mafia, the men who advocated an independent military arm composed of heavy bombers. George helped shape America's bomber strategy for the war by assisting Air War Plans Division with the development of a complete aircraft production and bombing strategy.|$|E

25|$|The American single {{began its}} 13-week chart run {{five days after}} release, and on 1 August started a two-week-long run at the top, setting a new record – nobody before had ever held the number one {{position}} on both the album and singles charts in the United Kingdom and the United States at the same time.

Directors of the series included <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> previously worked with Moffat on the show, and brand new ones. Filming began on 5 January 2015. The ninth series received high acclaim from critics, with many labelling it as the show's strongest season to date.

25|$|Foch, {{claiming}} that the Germans were showing signs of demoralisation, demanded (10 August) that Haig push on and capture the Somme crossings. Haig {{would have preferred to}} have First Army attack at Aubers and Third Army towards Bapaume, and after initially agreeing with Foch’s demand, changed his mind after consulting Currie and Lambert (GOC 32nd Division). Edmonds later claimed that Rawlinson was “almost insubordinate” in asking Haig whether he or “Marechal Foch” was in command, but this may not be an exact recollection as there is no record of the two men meeting that day. Haig told Byng (11 August) to be ready to attack with Third Army towards Bapaume and permitted Rawlinson to order a pause. Foch visited Haig’s command train that evening and concurred with the decision. Haig's initial orders to Rawlinson, to be ready to attack again after a short halt, have been criticised but Sheffield suggests that Haig had to defer to Foch this time, to clear the way for Byng’s attack. Haig then cancelled Fourth Army’s attack on Currie’s advice (based on aerial reconnaissance) that it would be “a desperate enterprise” for the BEF to overreach itself and engage new German troops with tired Allied <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> outrun much of their artillery cover, and he switched to a new line of offensive. Haig wrote that on 15 August he “spoke to Foch quite straightly, and let him understand that I was responsible for the handling of the British forces”. Foch {{had little choice but to}} agree, and interfered little with Haig’s decisions thereafter, but removed First French Army from Haig’s command.|$|E

500|$|Apple Records {{issued the}} single on 17 March 1972 in Britain, as Apple R 5944, with a US release taking place three days later, as Apple 1849. It was Starr's first release since [...] "It Don't Come Easy", a year before. During this period, his {{priority}} {{had been to}} develop a career as an actor in films such as 200 Motels (1971) and Blindman. Further aligning himself with Britain's glam rock movement, Starr made his directorial debut with Born to Boogie (1972), a film starring Bolan that included Starr's footage of a T. Rex concert held at Wembley on 18 March. With [...] "Back Off Boogaloo", NME critic Bob Woffinden noted Starr's success in establishing himself {{in the two years}} since the Beatles' break-up, and wrote that the single [...] "confirmed that he and Harrison, dark horses both, were the <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> managed their solo careers more purposefully and intelligently" [...] compared with McCartney and Lennon.|$|E

[...] but also that Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein [...] "Did not want to dis the Cardinals." [...] Shaughnessy also quoted Schilling as having said: [...] "There's a lot of good players in that [...] clubhouse over there. This isn't the time for us to be thinking about history. If we get three wins and 26 outs into the fourth win, I'm pretty sure it will hit us." [...] Before the series began, Shaughnessy wrote a piece saying that although the Red Sox had beaten the Yankees, the series needed to be won, as {{it was the only way}} the Curse of the Bambino, which he had publicized based on the book of the same title in 1990, would end, and demeaning chants of [...] "1918!" [...] would no longer echo at Yankee Stadium. During the series, he wrote a piece about how much people in New England were thinking about loved <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> spent their entire lives rooting for the Red Sox, hoping that one day, they would see their Red Sox win a World Series.|$|E
