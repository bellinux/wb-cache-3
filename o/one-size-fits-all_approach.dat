The former top-down approach involves putting rhetorical and diplomatic pressure on regimes to reform and can {{go so far as to}} involve direct American military engagement installing democratic government (as is the case in Iraq following the 2003 invasion). The U.S. government generally pursues the latter bottom-up approach by funding international organizations that help strengthen the bases for gradual democratic transition (the rule of law, accountable government institutions and expanded political competition) in the MENA region by offering technical assistance and training to political parties and electoral management bodies, engaging with civil society, producing assessments and polls, and promoting female political participation. Some have criticized American democracy promotion in MENA for ineffectiveness, a lack of consistency, taking a <b>one-size-fits-all</b> <b>approach</b> and using democracy to justify military intervention abroad. Moreover, It's said that US democracy promotion had been accompanied by heavy costs for US and considerable damage to the target countries.|$|E

The challenge facing most organizations is how to evaluate OSS adoption benefits. OSS adoption is a complex phenomenon which requires an interdisciplinary approach to understand the socio-technical, political, economic and legal benefits. The complexity of the OSS phenomenon has resulted in fiercely contested, contradictory rhetorical discussions among divided parties with no conclusive general agreement. The one size fits all approach is fundamentally flawed for evaluating OSS benefits in organizations as they are both subjective and contextual. In this paper we propose a framework to balance the needs of hard (objective) benefits and soft (subjective) benefits of OSS adoption in public sector organizations. This paper proposes a framework to evaluate benefits of OSS adoption in public-sector organizations, since <b>one-size-fits-all</b> <b>approaches</b> have shortcomings to complex phenomena...|$|R

There is currently {{a lack of knowledge}} of where and when variable fire regimes occurred, what caused them, at what spatial scales they occurred, and how often surface and stand-replacing fires occurred. In order to set future restoration and management goals that are appropriate and achievable for areas with variable fire regimes, we first need to understand the composition and structure of these landscapes (Swetnam et al. 1999). Understanding how variable fire regimes were influenced by local and regional factors in the past may help to forecast future changes (Swetnam et al. 1999). Furthermore, such information will be critical for prioritizing management actions, assessing the impacts of contemporary fires, and avoiding <b>one-size-fits-all</b> <b>approaches</b> (Morgan et al. 2001, Allen et al. 2002, Agee and Skinner 2005).|$|R
40|$|Processor power {{constraints}} {{have come}} to the forefront over the last decade, heralded by the stagnation of clock frequency scaling. High-performance core and cache designs often utilize power-hungry techniques to increase parallelism. Conversely, the most energy-efficient designs opt for a serial execution to avoid unnecessary overheads. While both of these extremes constitute <b>one-size-fits-all</b> <b>approaches,</b> a judicious mix of parallel and serial execution has the potential to achieve the best of both high-performing and energy-efficient designs. This dissertation examines such hybrid designs for cores and caches. Firstly, we introduce a novel, hybrid out-of-order/in-order core microarchitecture. Instructions that are steered towards in-order execution skip register allocation, reordering and dynamic scheduling. At the same time, these instructions can interleave on an instruction-by-instruction basis with instructions that continue to benefit from these conventional out-of-order mechanisms. Secondly, this dissertation revisits a hybrid technique introduced for L 1 caches, way-prediction, in the context of last-level caches that are larger, have higher associativity, and experience less locality...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{scholarship}} has considered what, if anything, rich people owe to poor people to achieve justice in global {{health and the}} implications of this for international research. Yet this work has primarily focused on international clinical research.

This paper provides an initial description of the ethical issues related to priority setting, capacity-building, and the provision of post-study benefits that arise during the conduct of such research. It presents a selection of issues discussed in the health systems research literature and argues that they constitute ethical concerns based on their being inconsistent with a particular theory of global justice (the health capability paradigm). Issues identified include the fact that priority setting for health systems research at the global level is often not driven by national priorities and that capacity-building efforts frequently utilize <b>one-size-fits-all</b> <b>approaches.</b> Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

Though they are a powerful tool for improving our educational system, standards alone cannot deliver widespread, meaningful change. To bring all students to much higher levels of achievement and to help underprepared students catch up to meet the standards' new demands, we must "do school differently. " This means redesigning how schools use teaching, time, technology, and money to create opportunities for more young people to succeed. And, it means replacing existing <b>one-size-fits-all</b> <b>approaches</b> with rigorous, personalized learning that creates multiple opportunities for students to be successful. Individual interventions are important, yet by themselves, they are not likely to produce sufficiently strong outcomes to help all students meet the demands of the new standards.

Centralized, <b>one-size-fits-all</b> <b>approaches</b> to policy and service {{delivery}} are increasingly recognized as being ineffectual due to the diverse character and needs of communities (COAG 2011; Burns et al, 2006). As such, {{in the last ten}} years, design has become increasingly viewed as a means of harnessing latent creativity and enabling social innovation in organizations and communities to address entrenched issues and effect change for the social and public good. These are explored in fields such as design for social innovation, service design and participatory design, to name a few. These fields pursue ways to support designing that are performed by non-design experts that can bring local knowledge and specific competences.

Implementing research to practice is a complex endeavor and requires the adaptation of basic research findings to different cultural and environmental contexts of intended beneficiaries (Sepinwall, 2002; Weisner 2 ̆ 6 Hay, 2014). The practice of formative research allows for the systematic assessment of diverse implementation contexts and provides insights into responsive adaptations of content and delivery.

The information provided could potentially reduce lost-to-follow up (LFU) rates for newborns who may be D/HH. Using qualitative methods, we collected and responded to feedback obtained from caregivers of newborns and were able to gear content, messaging and delivery of the intervention to stakeholder needs.

Systematic exploitation of the big data greatly helps in making the network smart, intelligent and facilitates cost-effective operation and optimization. In view of this, we consider a data-driven next-generation wireless network model, where the MNOs employ advanced data analytics for their networks. We discuss the data sources and strong drivers for the adoption of the data analytics and the role of machine learning, artificial intelligence in making the network intelligent in terms of being self-aware, self-adaptive, proactive and prescriptive.
