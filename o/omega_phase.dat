A large number of <b>omega</b> <b>phase</b> particles forms enveloping the icosahedral phase growing into aluminum rich melt, which solidify as alpha-Al solid solution. On the other side it develops an interface with aluminum. A detailed transmission electron microscopic analysis shows that <b>omega</b> <b>phase</b> exhibits orientation relationship with icosahedral phase. The composition analysis performed using energy dispersive x-ray analyzer suggests that this phase has composition higher aluminum than the icosahedral phase.

However, the gamma phase may be unstable as is reflected by the existence of imaginary values in the phonon spectra.

40|$|At high {{pressures}} zirconium {{is known}} to undergo a phase transformation from the hexagonal close packed (HCP) alpha phase to the simple hexagonal <b>omega</b> <b>phase.</b> Under conditions of shock loading, the high-pressure <b>omega</b> <b>phase</b> is retained upon release. However, the hysteresis in this transformation is not well represented by equilibrium phase diagrams and currently models that accurately represent such a solid-solid phase transformation coupled with the multi-phase plasticity likely under shock conditions do not exist. For this reason, the influence of peak shock stress on the retention of <b>omega</b> <b>phase</b> in Zr is explored in this study. In-situ VISAR measurements along with post-mortem metallographic and neutron diffraction characterization of soft recovered specimens have been utilized to quantify the volume fraction of retained <b>omega</b> <b>phase,</b> morphology of the shocked alpha and omega phases, and qualitatively understand the kinetics of this transformation.

40|$|An {{important}} part of a society’s resilience is how prepared it is {{to cope with the}} changing conditions during the alpha and <b>omega</b> <b>phases</b> according to resilience theory. Lars Thofelt, an academic from the mid Sweden region, early recognized this need for students to develop skills needed for a societal change, and devoted his life to pedagogy suitable for this. The main outcome of his achievement was the interdisciplinary university program in Ecotechnics/Ecotechnology (Ekoteknik in Swedish), at Mid Sweden University. Ecology, economy and technology in cooperation for sustainable development were the original approach, and still are. Thofelt’s ideas had a main focus of helping students develop their inherent capabilities of solving problems and overcome obstacles. After Thofelt’s 12 years at the program his ideas were carried on by former colleagues and students, and the teaching further developed with a mix of the Thofelt tradition and other experiences brought in by new employees. This paper describes this interdisciplinary teaching approach with special focus on development of resilience capacity in students. It was concluded that 1) a key element to develop resilience skills in students is to push them to a self-propelled learning behavior rather than traditional teaching, 2) not too easily provide the students with answers will develop their problem solving skills, 3) doing-before-reading teaching is more time consuming but seem to give deeper knowledge, 4) interdisciplinary teaching will in the long run benefit from having the interdisciplinary team within the department, rather than as a conglomerate of several departments...|$|R

40|$|To {{interpret}} remote spectral observations, scattering and absorption in a particulate surface are simulated via {{radiative transfer}} models. The standard model {{for this purpose}} among the planetary science community is the Hapke model. This model (like many others) uses two parameters to characterize the optical behavior of individual grains in a particulate surface, the single-scattering albedo <b>omega</b> and <b>phase</b> function p(g). These terms describe, respectively, the quantity and the angular distribution of light scattered by an individual grain. Unfortunately, these parameters are strictly optical. They can be rather difficult to interpret in terms of more interesting particle properties such as grain sizes, shapes, and compositions, that a remote sensing experiment might seek to discover. An equivalent slab approximation is typically used to relate omega to the grain size and optical constants of the material. This approach can mimic the wavelength-dependent absorption behavior of irregular grains, {{as long as the}} imaginary index kappa is much less than 1, the shape is equant, and the grain size D is much larger than the wavelength lambda.

Relatively, the phase modulation plays a more important role than the amplitude modulation in decreasing main lobe energy for different reasons. The phase modulation makes the energy flowing from the main lobe to side lobes, while amplitude modulation not only makes the energy flowing but also decreases tripling efficiency significantly.
