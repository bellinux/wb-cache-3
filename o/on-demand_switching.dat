40|$|We {{describe}} a system called Time Warp Football (TWF) which puts fans {{in control of}} the game watching experience. TWF uses annotated video streams to enable instantaneous forward and backward play-by-play navigation and <b>on-demand</b> <b>switching</b> between multiple camera angles. These features allow fans to easily watch and re-watch plays they are interested in from any camera angle. The annotations also allow for instantaneous game statistics whenever the fan desires. We took TWF into eleven different homes, connected it to the home TV, and provided a standard wireless video game controller to control the experience. Based on in-home user evaluations, we found that TWF provides an easy to learn interactive TV control system, effectively uses on screen prompts to enable groups to watch an interactive sporting event, and overall provides a successful interactive TV experience...|$|E
40|$|For a gastric {{electrical}} stimulation project we {{are developing a}} system for <b>on-demand</b> <b>switching</b> according to the volume or elongation of the stomach wall. The system is to be implanted into the human abdomen, which limits the utilization of many possible solutions and types of sensors. Magnetic induction has been agreed as the most suitable principle, despite its direction dependency and the need of multi-axial and multiple probes for precision measurements. Possible configurations are discussed {{as well as the}} complexity of the necessary electronics and the implantation itself. For detecting food consumption, perfect precision is fortunately not necessary, but a certain compromise will still be necessary for the final system. A simple two-coil system – a transmitter and receiver and a system with a three-axial coil – have already been realized. The first system has already been successfully tested in-vivo on dogs by our US colleagues. However, if the implantation is badly performed, and the coils are completely out of axis, the system cannot sense relative changes in volume properly. The three-axial sensor presented here eliminates these problems. More complex arrangements emerging from magnetic tracking are discussed, because laboratory studies of stomach movements may require them. ...|$|E
40|$|The project {{aim is to}} {{evaluate}} if vibrations, in a train bridge, {{can be used in}} an on-demand bridgemonitoring system, for vibrational stress, using a technique called EcoSense. The EcoSense architectureis used to reduce the power consumption of sensors by only allowing them to use power when a desiredmeasurement is wanted (e. g. a train passes). The main task is to analyse how such a system can bebuilt to perform as efficiently as possible. The system should be tested at Lidingö bridge in Stockholm. The resulting circuit was successful to be used as an <b>on-demand</b> <b>switch</b> for a sensor on Lidingö bridge. Testing and evaluation of different specifications of the circuit was done. The final conclusion is thatEcoSense is applicable for bridge vibrational sensing and designs can be tailored to fit the specificationsof a bridge...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – We propose {{and analyze}} the <b>on-demand</b> channel <b>switching</b> (ODC), a novel broadcast-based medium access control (MAC) {{protocol}} for ad-hoc wireless networks with multiple channels at each host. The ODC performs an on-demand, dynamic, channel selection based on the traffic conditions of the channels and communication pattern of each host. A host stays on a channel as long as its traffic share on that channel is above a certain threshold, below which it switches to another channel. It aims on reducing the unnecessary receives and channel switches, while still being able to send and receive legitimate traffic. This can enhance the bandwidth utilization, reduce packet delays, and increase energy savings. ODC does not require any specialized hardware. We evaluate the ODC with extensive simulations and compare it with the IEEE 802. 11 and another related MAC protocol (MMAC). We found that the flow distribution among hosts has {{a great impact on}} its performance. For example, in networks in which a host communicates with only one other host at a given time, there is an up to 180 % increase in the aggregate throughput compared to the IEEE 802. 11, and a 15 - 35 % increase compared to the MMAC. On the other hand, networks with hosts with multiple flows to different hosts simultaneously tend to favor the IEEE 802. 11 over the ODC and MMAC. I...|$|R
