[...] "He {{has the ability}} to repeat his swing <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over,</b> which leads to him being very consistent", Cardinals' video coordinator Chad Blair said. Sports Illustrated writer Daniel G. Habib described the swing as [...] "quick" [...] and [...] "quiet." [...] Pujols uses a 32.5-ounce bat against right-handed pitchers, but he uses a 33-ounce bat against left-handers to avoid trying to pull the ball when he swings. Defensively, Pujols has won two Gold Glove Awards since moving to first base in 2004. He has credited his hitting ability partly to guessing what pitchers will do: ...|$|E
500|$|Although it was {{omitted from}} a number of concerts because of short time allotments, Slayer have often said that they enjoy playing the album in its entirety. According to Hanneman: [...] "We still enjoy playing these songs live. We play these songs <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over,</b> but they're good songs, intense songs! If it were melodic songs or some kind of boring 'clap your hands' song, you'd be going crazy playing those every night. But our songs are just bam-bam-bam-bam, they're intense." [...] The band was on stage for 70 minutes, which only allowed seven or eight {{additional}} songs to be played following the album's play. King stated this arrangement [...] "alienates too many people". In the Unholy Alliance Tour of 2004, however, the album was played in its entirety during Slayer's set as the last ten songs to end the show. The album was performed live at the I'll Be Your Mirror London festival in May 2012. In May 2014, it was announced that Slayer would perform the album in its entirety at Riot Fest in Chicago and Denver.|$|E

He had been through a dark patch personally—culminating with a stay in hospital—and Hepburn felt that a play would help restore his focus. Tracy told a journalist in April, [...] "I'm coming back to Broadway to see if I can still act." [...] The play was The Rugged Path by Robert E. Sherwood. It first previewed in Providence on September 28, to a sold out crowd and tepid response. It was a difficult production; director Garson Kanin later wrote: [...] "In the ten days prior to the New York opening all the important relationships had deteriorated. Spencer was tense and unbending, could not, or would not, take direction". Tracy considered leaving the show before it even opened on Broadway, and lasted there just six weeks before announcing his intention to close the show. It closed on January 19, 1946, after 81 performances. Tracy later explained to a friend: [...] "I couldn't say those goddamn lines <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again every night... At least every day is a new day for me in films... But this thing—every day, every day, over and over again." ...|$|E
