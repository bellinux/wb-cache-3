50|$|In Variation 3, the {{decision}} maker is knowledgeable of the situation but unaware of the proper course <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> The decision maker therefore implements a mental trial and error simulation to develop the most effective course <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Variation 3 {{takes the form of}} “If… then… (???)” wherein {{the decision}} maker models outcomes of new or uncommon courses <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> The decision maker will cycle through different courses <b>of</b> <b>action</b> until a course <b>of</b> <b>action</b> appears appropriate to the goals and priorities of the situation. Due to the time constraint fundamental to the RPD model, {{the decision maker}} will choose the first course <b>of</b> <b>action</b> which appears appropriate to the situation. Experienced decision makers are likely to develop a viable course <b>of</b> <b>action</b> more quickly because their expert knowledge can rapidly be used to disqualify inappropriate courses <b>of</b> <b>action.</b>|$|R

5|$|As regards proportionality, the law {{states that}} a self-defense {{may not be}} manifestly disproportionate. It is evident, that for a self-defense to be successful, {{it has to be}} {{performed}} on a level exceeding the attack. Unlike in case of necessity, the consequence of necessary self-defense may be more serious than consequence of the attack. The defense may not be restricted to a passive one, it can also be active. It is not the outcome of the incident but the sequence <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> at its beginning which determines who is to be deemed the attacker, and who is the party attacked.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the idea of}} an extended unit <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> which is the idea that the reasons for or against an individual action can depend on the qualities of a larger pattern <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> which it is a part. One concept <b>of</b> joint <b>action</b> is that the unit <b>of</b> <b>action</b> can be extended in this sense. But {{the idea of an}} extended unit <b>of</b> <b>action</b> is surprisingly minimal in its commitments. The paper argues for this conclusion by examining uses of the idea of an extended unit <b>of</b> <b>action</b> in four theoretical contexts. It also explains why the idea of an extended unit <b>of</b> <b>action</b> need not involve magical thinking, and discusses possible replies to an objection based on a worry about recklessness...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of Akrasia – free and intentional action against one’s own better judgment – {{is one of}} the most difficult phenomena to explain for the Causal Theory <b>of</b> <b>Action.</b> Critics have argued that the Causal Theory <b>of</b> <b>Action</b> is unable to explain why Akratic actions exist. The aim of this paper is to develop an understanding of Akrasia that enables reconciling it with the Causal Theory <b>of</b> <b>Action.</b> First, the common model <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> the Causal Theory <b>of</b> <b>Action</b> is revised in order to enable understanding <b>of</b> Akratic <b>action.</b> Subsequently, the concept of ‘Desire for Continence’ is developed to explain Akrasia from the perspective of the actor. The revised model <b>of</b> <b>action</b> and ‘Desire for Continence’ are then combined to show how the {{phenomenon of}} Akrasia can be understood within the Causal Theory <b>of</b> <b>Action...</b>|$|R

Here, the player is tasked with the delivery of a contaminated drink to an unspecified non-player character. After the first level is completed, the player {{is sent to the}} second level of the game, which follows the pattern of the first; the player is assigned a set <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> and goals involving platforming sequences.|$|E
5|$|Hirschman {{believed}} that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't {{in fact a}} theory of growth. Growth implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage. It entails the series <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity. However, the balanced growth theory involves {{the creation of a}} brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.|$|E

5|$|In March 1943, Wilcke led Geschwaderstab and II. and III. Gruppe during {{operations}} against the Kuban bridgehead {{as part of}} the IV. Fliegerkorps (4th Air Corps). In early May 1943, the Geschwaderstab was ordered out <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> and returned to München-Gladbach, present-day Mönchengladbach. Wilcke had only the Geschwaderstab and I. Gruppe under his effective command and no further combat missions were flown until October 1943.|$|E
5|$|In combat, a quick time event (QTE) feature, {{also called}} context {{sensitive}} attacks, is initiated when the player has weakened a strong foe. The player performs a sequence <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> {{on the game}} controller shortly after an image of its circle button appears as an on-screen prompt. This allows for limited control of Kratos during a QTE cinematic sequence, which, if successful, ends the battle; failure usually results in damage to the protagonist. Similar in function is a quick time sex mini-game {{in the form of}} an encounter with female twins, which has become a regular feature throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd list {{four main}} methods of {{creating}} machinima. From simple to advanced, these are: {{relying on the}} game's AI to control most actions, digital puppetry, recamming, and precise scripting <b>of</b> <b>actions.</b> Although simple to produce, AI-dependent results are unpredictable, thus complicating the realization of a preconceived film script. For example, when Rooster Teeth produced The Strangerhood using The Sims 2, a game that encourages the use of its AI, the group had to create multiple instances of each character to accommodate different moods. Individual instances were selected at different times to produce appropriate actions.|$|E

5|$|The {{conventional}} {{level of}} moral reasoning {{is typical of}} adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of {{the third and fourth}} stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the program <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> {{activities}} under the conditions of transition and content complexity. The path of the program <b>of</b> <b>action</b> was explored through a number of classroom activities in the areas of writing, literature, vocabulary, and grammar. In particular the configuration and the management of the program <b>of</b> <b>action</b> were examined to determine what was done by classroom inhabitants to guide and protect the program <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> activities. The setting of the study was a freshman honors English class in a southwest urban high school. The teacher was identified as an able manager, a factor that was expected to limit the competing vectors that might be triggered by discipline problems. Observations of the class were done over ten weeks or a quarter of the school year. The third period class was observed daily, and a total of forty activities were gathered and analyzed. Data analysis was done over a period of seven months. A quantitative summary of the activities showing activity types and time devoted to each activity type was compiled. The activity summaries were scanned to note emerging patterns. Programs <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> each activity type were mapped to illustrate the configuration and maintenance of the program <b>of</b> <b>action</b> and the emergence and handling of competing vectors. The final phase of the analysis was the comparison <b>of</b> programs <b>of</b> <b>action</b> across two levels of content complexity. Findings showed that the life of the program <b>of</b> <b>action</b> in classrooms varied according to activity type. The teacher emerged as the controller <b>of</b> <b>action</b> as illustrated by his choice of content presentation modes and activities. The comparison <b>of</b> programs <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> activities across content complexity showed that students participated more in the maintenance and sustenance of the program <b>of</b> <b>action</b> in activities in which the content was less complex than they did in activities with more complex content. Furthermore, when the content was more complex, the teacher's control of the maintenance of the program <b>of</b> <b>action</b> was more apparent. The length of transition was found to impact negatively the subsequent program <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> On the other hand, lengthy opening activities emerged as contributors to the maintenance <b>of</b> programs <b>of</b> <b>action...</b>|$|R
