Temporary outdoor displays <b>of</b> <b>sculpture</b> can also be seen at the Royal Academy and the Chelsea College of Arts. In 2010 Westminster City Council inaugurated the City <b>of</b> <b>Sculpture</b> project, which has seen contemporary sculpture installed in locations across the borough.|$|E

5|$|Stela 53 is a {{fragment}} <b>of</b> <b>sculpture</b> {{that was found}} in the latter Early Preclassic phase of Structure12, directly behind Stela 5. Stela53 forms a part of the Cargador del Ancestro sculpture. Stela5 was placed {{at the same time that}} Stela53 was embedded in Structure12, and the long count date on the former also allows the placing of Stela53 to be fixed in time at Late Preclassic–Early Classic transition.|$|E
5|$|Takalik Abaj is {{representative}} of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC.

5|$|A small example {{excavated}} {{from underneath}} the Late Preclassic levels of Structure E3-1 at Chalchuapa in El Salvador may date to the Middle Preclassic. Three potbelly monuments were found resting on a large terrace in Santa Leticia in El Salvador, a site near Chalchuapa consisting of various mounds and platforms. These monuments were large and especially obese. Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 were important in securely dating the potbelly style <b>of</b> <b>sculpture.</b> The El Salvador potbellies conform to the Monte Alto style of boulder sculpture.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, 304 stone monuments {{have been}} found at Takalik Abaj, mostly carved from local {{andesite}} boulders. Of these monuments 124 are carved with the remainder being plain; they are mostly found in the Central and Western Groups. The worked monuments {{can be divided into}} four broad classifications: Olmec-style sculptures, which represent 21% of the total, Maya-style sculptures representing 42% of the monuments, potbelly monuments (14% of the total) and the local style <b>of</b> <b>sculpture</b> represented by zoomorphs (23% of the total).|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 12, Achebe {{moved away}} from his family {{to the village of}} Nekede, four {{kilometres}} from Owerri. He enrolled as a student at the Central School, where his older brother John taught. In Nekede, Achebe gained an appreciation for Mbari, a traditional art form that seeks to invoke the gods' protection through symbolic sacrifices in the form <b>of</b> <b>sculpture</b> and collage. (He would later suggest the name for the Mbari Writers and Artists Club that was founded in Ibadan by Ulli Beier and others in 1961.) When the time came to change to secondary school, in 1944, Achebe sat entrance examinations for and was accepted at both the prestigious Dennis Memorial Grammar School in Onitsha and the even more prestigious Government College in Umuahia.|$|E

5|$|Deleury {{suggests}} {{that although the}} temple may have {{been built in the}} 13th century, given the Hemadpanthi style architecture, the statue of Vithoba is of an earlier style so may have been carved for an earlier, smaller shrine that existed in Pandharpur. The workmanship of the image is earlier than the style of the Yadava (1175–1318), the Anhivad Chalukya (943–1210) and even the Ajmer Chohans (685–1193) eras. Although no other existing Vishnu temple has iconography like Pandharpur's Vithoba, Deleury finds similarities between the Pandharpur image and the third-century, arms-akimbo Vishnu images at Udaygiri Caves, Madhya Pradesh but declares that they are from different schools <b>of</b> <b>sculpture.</b>|$|E
5|$|From Iran, {{the breed}} is {{mentioned}} in the poetry of Khaghani (1121-1190), depicted in miniature paintings of hunting scenes along with horseback archers by Master Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād (1450–1535), depicted in book illustrations by 'Abd al-Wahhab ibn 'Abd al-Fattah ibn 'Ali (1516), and in metal-smithing from {{the reign of the}} Injuid prince, Jamal al Dine Abu Is'haq, created between 1342–1353. One of the more outstanding pieces <b>of</b> <b>sculpture</b> in Iran is the Savashi Canyon Relief, carved around 1800, that was commissioned by Shar Fath-Ali Shah Qajar to commemorate his hunting exploits.|$|E
5|$|Hoysala temples have {{distinct}} {{parts that}} are merged {{to form a}} unified organic whole, {{in contrast to the}} temples of Tamil country where different parts of a temple stand independently. Although superficially unique, Hoysala temples resemble each other structurally. They are characterised by a complex profusion <b>of</b> <b>sculpture</b> decorating all the temple parts chiselled of soft soapstone (chloritic schist), a good material for intricate carving, executed mostly by local craftsmen, and exhibit architectural features that distinguish them from other temple architectures of South India.|$|E

5|$|Kneale's {{younger brother}} is the renowned artist and {{sculptor}} Bryan Kneale, who was Master and then Professor <b>of</b> <b>Sculpture</b> at the Royal Academy from 1982 to 1990. Bryan Kneale painted the covers for the Quatermass script books released by Penguin Books in 1959 and 1960.

5|$|The Cargador del Ancestro ("Ancestor Carrier") {{consists}} of four fragments <b>of</b> <b>sculpture</b> that had been reused in the facades of four different buildings during {{the latter part of}} the Late Preclassic. Monuments 215 and 217 were discovered in 2008 during excavations of Structure 7A, while Stela Fragments 53 and 61 had been unearthed in previous excavations. Archaeologists discovered that although Monuments 215 and 217 possessed different themes and were executed in differing styles, they in fact fitted together perfectly to form part of a single sculpture that was still incomplete. This prompted a revision of previously found sculpture fragments and resulted in the discovery of two further pieces, originally found in Structures 12 and 74.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconography}} of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti {{was influenced by}} Gandhara architectural tradition, which impacted the iconographic depictions of sculptures of Northwest India, particularly those made in Kashmir. Keeping with the Gandhara style, the body and legs are depicted as strong and sturdy. The muscular body {{is considered to be}} inflated with prana (life-breath), an Indian concept. The bow arched eyebrows and lotus shaped eyes are also characteristic of the Indian school <b>of</b> <b>sculpture.</b> The presence of the earth goddess at the feet also reflects Central Asian influence. The ayudhapurushas in the icon may be inspired by those in the Vishnu {{iconography of}} Gupta art. They and the earth goddess are also part of traditional Vishnu iconography, even when he is depicted as one-headed.|$|E
