5|$|Astrology saw {{a popular}} revival {{starting}} in the 19th century, {{as part of a}} general revival of spiritualism and—later, New Age philosophy, and through the influence <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> such as newspaper horoscopes. Early in the 20th century the psychiatrist Carl Jung developed some concepts concerning astrology, which {{led to the development of}} psychological astrology.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days, Menem sported an image {{similar to the}} old caudillos, such as Facundo Quiroga and Chacho Peñaloza. He groomed his sideburns in a similar style. His presidential inauguration was {{attended}} by several gauchos. Contrary to Peronist tradition, Menem did not prepare huge rallies in the Plaza de Mayo to address {{the people from the}} balcony of the Casa Rosada. Instead, he took full advantage <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media,</b> such as television.|$|E

The club's technical director, Miguel Pardeza, categorically stated on 13 July that the player would remain at the club, however, and Jesé extended his contract for a further four years later in the same month, signing a deal worth more than €1 million a year and which contained a €200 million release clause.|$|E

25|$|Until the mid-20th century, the Virgin Islands {{were largely}} {{culturally}} isolated from international popular music. In the 1960s, a growth in tourism caused {{an influx of}} immigrants to fill the service positions the tourism industry created. These immigrants brought with them many styles of popular music, which were popularized by the growth <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> in the islands, including television and radio.|$|E
25|$|Italy has {{numerous}} dialects spoken {{all over}} the country. However, {{the establishment of a}} national education system has led to decrease in variation in the languages spoken across the country.

25|$|Before {{the arrival}} <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> in Cornwall and telegraphy, since 1688, Falmouth was {{the hub of}} the Packet ships Post Office mail system. Newspapers were slow to develop in Cornwall. Despite the first British {{newspaper}} (London Gazette) starting in 1665, due to poor roads, and long distances, distribution of national newspapers did not start fully until the coming of the railways in the 1840s. Outside key urban areas like Truro and Falmouth, national news travelled slowly, and unreliably, by word of mouth.|$|E
25|$|At the time, Jiang Qing and {{associates}} held effective control <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> and the party's propaganda network, while Zhou and Deng held control of most government organs. On some decisions, Mao sought {{to mitigate the}} Gang's influence, but on others, he acquiesced to their demands. The Gang of Four's heavy hand in political and media control did not prevent Deng from reinstating his economic policies. Deng emphatically opposed Party factionalism, and his policies aimed to promote unity {{as the first step}} to restoring economic productivity.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1930s, {{what was}} {{considered}} an elite literary form of the Telugu language has now spread to the common people with the introduction <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> like movies, television, radio and newspapers. This form of the language is also taught in schools as a standard. In the current decade the Telugu language, like other Indian languages, has undergone globalization due to the increasing settlement of Telugu-speaking people abroad. Modern Telugu movies, although still retaining their dramatic quality, are linguistically separate from post-Independence films.|$|E

25|$|Radio {{broadcasting}} {{emerged on}} a mass {{scale in the}} United States {{during the first half}} of the 1920s, with the number of stations in operation rising from 28 in 1921 to 571 in 1925. A new form <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> had emerged. Congress passed federal legislation called the Radio Act of 1927 early in that year establishing a Federal Radio Commission (FRC), which was granted power to regulate the emerging industry, granting licenses and assigning broadcasting wavelengths to bring order to a chaotic market.|$|E
25|$|The effects <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> {{on attitudes}} toward intellect are {{certainly}} multiple and ambiguous. On the one hand, mass communications greatly expand {{the sheer volume}} of information available for public consumption. On the other hand, much of this information comes pre-interpreted for easy digestion and laden with hidden assumption, saving consumers the work of having to interpret it for themselves. Commodified information naturally tends to reflect the assumptions and interests of those who produce it, and its producers are not driven entirely by a passion to promote critical reflection.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} poetry helped {{transition}} Pashto {{to the modern}} period. Pashto literature gained significant prominence in the 20th century, with poetry by Ameer Hamza Shinwari who developed Pashto Ghazals. In 1919, during the expanding <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media,</b> Mahmud Tarzi published Seraj-al-Akhbar, which became the first Pashto newspaper in Afghanistan. In 1977, Khan Roshan Khan wrote Tawarikh-e-Hafiz Rehmatkhani which contains the family trees and Pashtun tribal names. Some notable poets include Khushal Khan Khattak, Afzal Khan Khattak, Ajmal Khattak, Pareshan Khattak, Rahman Baba, Nazo Anaa, Hamza Shinwari, Ahmad Shah Durrani, Timur Shah Durrani, Shuja Shah Durrani, Ghulam Muhammad Tarzi, and Ghani Khan.|$|E

It {{is estimated that}} there are about 64 million native Italian speakers while {{the total number of}} Italian speakers, including those who use it as a second language, is about 85 million.

25|$|The word godman is a colloquial blanket {{term used}} for charismatic spiritual leaders in India. Locally, {{they may be}} {{referred}} to as baba, swami, guru, shastri, bapu or bhagat. Many of them claim to have magic or psychic powers and perform miracles. On the other hand, some only provide spiritual advice. There are also female gurus. Many of them are worshipped by their followers as avatars or living gods. Many of them belong to ancient ascetic lineages or claim to be successor to some previous spiritual predecessor. Some of them have built large pan-Indian or international networks. Their recent success has been attributed to the use <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> and public relations techniques.|$|E
