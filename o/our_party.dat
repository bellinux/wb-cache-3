But Khrushchev is trying in vain... Under the leadership of the PLA, the Albanian people have scored historic victories in the course of these twenty years: they liberated the country from the fascist invaders and established the people's state power, reconstructed the war-ravaged country, liquidated the centuries-old backwardness and achieved great successes in the construction of socialist society... <b>Our</b> <b>Party</b> is fighting for a great cause, for the truth of Marxism-Leninism... On this course, marching shoulder to shoulder with the sister Marxist-Leninist parties and the fraternal peoples of the socialist countries, as well as with all the revolutionary forces of the world, <b>our</b> <b>Party</b> and people will score complete victory over the imperialist and revisionist enemies. Marxism-Leninism cannot be vanquished! Socialism and communism will triumph!" ...|$|E

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 17 October, two weeks after their arrival, Horatio and eighteen of his party were murdered in the deadliest massacre of settlers by Aborigines in Australian history. Tom was away from the property at the time, having been sent with two stockmen to collect supplies left en route to Cullin-la-Ringo. He returned several days later to a scene of devastation. Despairing and in shock, Wills first wrote to Harrison in Melbourne: [...] "... all <b>our</b> <b>party</b> except I have been slaughtered by the black's ... I am in a great fix no men." [...] Police, native police and vigilante groups from neighbouring stations swiftly tracked down and killed at least 70 local Aborigines; the total may have been 300.

40|$|We {{develop a}} model of spatial {{elections}} that departs from the standard model in three important respects. Our parties' information of voters' preferences is limited to polls; <b>our</b> <b>parties</b> can be either office-seeking of ideological; and <b>our</b> <b>parties</b> are not perfect optimizers, i. e. they are modeled as boundedly rational actors. Since <b>our</b> imperfect <b>parties</b> do not necessarily find optimal positions, rather than concern ourselves with existence and location of equilibria, we trace the trajectory of winning party positions. The outcomes are subsequently evaluated {{with respect to a}} measure of social welfare, centrality. Our results suggest that in fair voting systems, two party elections lead to normatively appealing outcomes. We are seeking to introduce the role of computers genearlly and adaptive artificial agents (AAA) specifically, to the study of parties, voters, and elections in spatial models. We argue for using adaptive parties to add behavioral complexity to stand formal models of politics without sacrificing a logical foundation. Doing so may not only revise our judgments about the relevance of spatial voting models to real elections, but it may lead us to important insights about what occurs in those elections. ...|$|R

[...] On November 5 a 125-page letter was sent from the Central Committee of the CPSU to its Chinese counterpart ignoring the existence of Albania as a socialist country and [...] "malign the Party of Labour of Albania." [...] Later noting this letter in regards to China, Hoxha wrote that, [...] "They distributed this voluminous material against China before the meeting, in order to prepare the terrain and to brainwash the delegations of other parties, and to intimidate the Chinese, to compel them to take a moderate stand, if they would not submit.

The stated purpose of the Conference was to have [...] "the character of a preliminary meeting of the representatives of the communist and workers' parties, mainly for the purpose of 'exchanging opinions' and taking a joint decision on the date and place of a future meeting of the communist and workers' parties of the world." [...] In his memoirs Hoxha describes the Conference as being [...] "putsch" [...] and adds, [...] "The revisionist renegades needed another meeting of international communism to gain approval for their old plan for the final legitimization of modern revisionism," [...] he did not attend because [...] " [...] suspected that the problem of the differences which had emerged between China and the Soviet Union would be discussed... we had heard only one side of the argument, the Soviet side, and we were not acquainted with the objections of the Chinese... They had to be thrashed out thoroughly, they had to be studied carefully, and time was required for this.
