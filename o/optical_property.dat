5|$|The luster of {{a diamond}} is {{described}} as 'adamantine', which simply means diamond-like. Reflections on a properly cut diamond's facets are undistorted, due to their flatness. The refractive index of diamond (as measured via sodium light, 589.3nm) is 2.417. Because it is cubic in structure, diamond is also isotropic. Its high dispersion of 0.044 (variation of refractive index across the visible spectrum) manifests in the perceptible fire of cut diamonds. This fire—flashes of prismatic colors seen in transparent stones—is perhaps diamond's most important <b>optical</b> <b>property</b> from a jewelry perspective. The prominence or amount of fire seen in a stone is heavily influenced by the choice of diamond cut and its associated proportions (particularly crown height), although the body color of fancy (i.e., unusual) diamonds may hide their fire to some degree.|$|E

Since many atmospheric organic compounds have different <b>optical</b> <b>properties,</b> {{it is difficult to}} determine the <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> of OC accurately. In particular, hygroscopicity and light absorption of OC are important factors in understanding the aerosol <b>optical</b> <b>properties.</b> In this study, the sensitivity of organic carbon (OC) to aerosol <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> was tested. Both the refractive index and the hygroscopicity of OC were considered. Based on the filter-based monthly averaged sampling measurement data from an intensive observation site in Seoul, Korea, the contribution of each component on the aerosol <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> was estimated. The aerosol <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> were simulated by combining the aerosol dynamic model for polydispersed aerosols with an <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> model based on Mie code. The <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> were compared with the AERONET Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) measurement data. In order to estimate the contribution of the light absorption and hygroscopicity of organic carbon (OC) on the <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> of the aerosols, a sensitivity test was conducted with different imaginary refractive indices and OC hygroscopic growth factors. The results show that mass absorption efficiency can be fitted linearly as the imaginary refractive index increases. This means that one can estimate the mass absorption efficiency of OC as a function of the imaginary refractive index. The results also show that mass extinction and absorption efficiency decrease as the hygroscopic factor of OC increases because of the increase in water content. The contribution of OC to the mass extinction efficiency, however, depends on the chemical composition of other aerosol mixtures and hence, more comprehensive studies are required in this regard...|$|R

50|$|Babefphite is an {{anisotropic}} mineral {{meaning that}} the velocity of light passing though it will {{vary depending on the}} direction of travel. When measured against Canada Balsam it will display moderate positive relief. Relief is an <b>optical</b> <b>property</b> that relates the index of refraction of a mineral versus the index of refraction of another material. Positive relief denotes light being bent toward the mineral. Negative relief means the light is bent toward the mounting material. In the case of optical mineralogy, this other material is most often whatever material is used to mount the mineral in question in thin section. Based on the white color of babefphite in hand sample it is likely that it appears clear in thin section under plane polarized light. Due to its anisotropic nature, it has the possibility of displaying very weak pleochroism under the same conditions. Pleochroism is defined as a change of color, on rotation, of plane light. It occurs when the extraordinary and ordinary rays of light are absorbed differently, thereby displaying different colors. The wider the difference in the rays the more dramatic the color change. Babefphite is also weakly birefringent. Birefringence is an <b>optical</b> <b>property</b> that is determined by the direction that light passes through a mineral.|$|E

5000|$|In 1956, John Marmon {{observed}} that fibrous aggregates of ulexite project {{an image of}} an object on the opposite surface of the mineral. This <b>optical</b> <b>property</b> is common for synthetic fibers, but not in minerals, giving ulexite the nickname [...] "TV rock". According to Baur et al. (1957), this <b>optical</b> <b>property</b> {{is due to the}} reflections along twinned fibers, the most prominent twinning plane being on (010). The light is internally reflected over and over within each of the fibers that are surrounded by a medium of a lower refractive index (Garlick, 1991). This optical effect is also the result of the large spaces formed by the sodium octahedral chains in the mineral structure. Synthetic fibers used for fiber optics transmit images along a bundle of threadlike crystals the same way naturally occurring ulexite reproduces images due to the existence of different indices of refractions between fibers. Additionally, if the object is colored, all of the colors are reproduced by ulexite. Parallel surfaces of ulexite cut perpendicular to the fibers produce the best image, as distortion {{in the size of the}} projected image will occur if the surface is not parallel to the mineral. Curiously, in situ samples of ulexite are capable of producing a decent, rough image. Satin spar gypsum also exhibits this optical effect; however the fibers are too coarse to transmit a decent image. The thickness of the fibers is proportional to the sharpness of the projected image.|$|E
40|$|Nonspherical ice crystal <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> are of {{fundamental}} importance to atmospheric radiative transfer through an ice cloud and the remote sensing of its properties. In practice, the <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> of individual ice crystals {{need to be}} integrated over particle size distributions to derive the bulk <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> of ice clouds. Given a particle size distribution represented in terms of size bins, the conventional approach uses the microphysical and <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> of ice crystals at the bin centers as approximations to the bin-averaged values. However, errors are incurred when the size bins are large. To reduce the potential errors, a kernel technique is utilized to calculate the bulk <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> of ice clouds by computing the bin-averaged values instead of using the bin-center values. Comparisons between the solutions based on the conventional method and the kernel technique for different numbers of size bins from in situ measurements demonstrate that the results computed from the kernel technique are more accurate. The present study illustrates that, for a given size distribution, 40 or more size bins {{should be used to}} calculate the bulk <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> of ice clouds by the conventional method.
