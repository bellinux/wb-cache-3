40|$|In {{response}} to the confirmed transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from a surgeon to several patients in the Netherlands, a ‘Committee for Prevention of Iatrogenic Hepatitis B’ was established in 2000. During the years 2000 – 2008, the committee reviewed 99 cases of HBV-infected health care workers. Fifty of them were found to <b>perform</b> <b>exposure</b> prone procedures (EPPs). Because of high levels of HBV DNA (> 100, 000 copies/ml), a ban <b>on</b> <b>performing</b> EPPs was applied in 11 / 50 cases; 25 / 50 low-viremic health care workers were allowed to continue EPPs while their HBV load was being monitored; and 14 / 50 cases had stopped working or changed profession. In five restricted workers who started oral antiviral treatment, HBV replication was persistently suppressed, enabling the ban on EPPs to be lifted. Throughout the European Union different levels of HBV viremia have been chosen, above which health care workers {{are not allowed to}} perform EPPs. It remains unknown how this affects the safety of patients. Application in the Netherlands of a European or a British guideline would have, respectively, doubled or tripled the number of restricted health care workers...|$|R

40|$|The fluvial {{strata of}} the Nýřany Member (Westphalian D - Cantabrian) {{and of the}} lower part of the Týnec Formation (Cantabrian - Barruelian) have been the {{subjects}} of systematic sedimentological studies. Detailed analyses of the facies, paleocurrents, and sedimentary architecture were <b>performed</b> <b>on</b> the <b>exposures.</b> The cumulative stratigraphical thickness of the studied successions reaches about 100 m. Six sedimentary facies were distinguished: siltstone with plant material content (Fsm), fine-grained horizontal laminated sandstone (Sh), medium- to coarse-grained cross stratified sandstone (Sc), fine- to medium-grained massive conglomerate (Gm), fine- to medium-grained cross stratified conglomerate (Gcm), and coarse-grained cross stratified conglomerate (Gcc). Five architectural elements were identified: channels (CH), sand bed forms (SB), gravel bars and bed forms (GB), sediment gravity-flow deposits (SG), and downstream accretion macroforms (DA). All of these sediments represent braided river systems, though the type or behaviour of these systems differs at individual localities. Most of them were high energy, braided rivers of low sinuosity. Laterally migrating braided streams of low sinuosity, possibly forming braidplain fluvial environments, were distinguished at the Hostibejk Cliff deposits and in {{the lower part of}} the Pecínov quarry succession. Deposits indicative of vertically aggrading streams of higher sinuosity and lower energy fluvial environments were recognized in the Lobeč Cliff deposits and in the upper part of Pecínov quarry.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Manganese {{exposure}} {{can cause}} neurobehavioral and neurological signs and symptoms. A {{review of the}} literature was carried out in order to identify the most sensitive and effective methods to assess these outcomes. METHODS: Studies <b>on</b> manganese <b>exposure</b> <b>performed</b> with neuropsychological tests were reviewed using Medline. Test methods, obtained outcomes, and dose-response relationships were considered. Based on the review and additional considerations, a testing battery for adult and children was identified. RESULTS: A total number of 31 studies were reviewed and divided in 18 occupational, 7 environmental, and 6 on children. A large variety of tests exploring motor and cognitive functions and mood were applied. Neurobehavioral effects were dose-dependent in several studies and determined by much lower exposure levels compared to 1 mg Mn/m(3) in total dust which is considered to be the minimum concentration able to induce the classical clinical features of "manganism. " Although through a wide variety of tests, the observed outcomes support the knowledge that manganese exposure can cause neurobehavioral effects. Motor functions are mainly affected in adults, and cognitive functions and behavior are more affected in children. CONCLUSIONS: Literature on manganese neurobehavioral effect is quite consistent, however, further improvement may be achieved by using better structured and more comparable evaluation methods. Based on the analysis of the existing experiences a test battery including tests of motor functions, response speed, cognitive functions, intellectual abilities, mood, and symptom questionnaires is suggested. We recommend that the tests indicated should always be included in future studies as a core battery...|$|R

To some, this fear is tolerable, but to other, the fear could pose danger to their life if the fear is starting to interfere with their day to day activities. The conventional treatment for acrophobia is usually done through exposure therapy, where individuals suffering acrophobia will be gradually exposed (physically) to the height.

40|$|Very few {{ecotoxicological}} {{studies have been}} <b>performed</b> <b>on</b> long-term <b>exposure</b> under controlled conditions, hence limiting {{the assessment of the}} impact of chronic and diffuse chemical pressures on the health of aquatic organisms. In this study, an ecotoxicoproteomic approach was used to assess the integrated response and possible acclimation mechanisms in Gammarus fossarum following chronic exposures to Cd, Cu or Pb, at environmentally realistic concentrations (i. e. 0. 25, 1. 5 and 5 µg/L respectively). After 10 -week exposure, changes in protein expression were investigated in caeca of control and exposed males. Gel-free proteomic analyses allowed for the identification of 35 proteins involved in various biological functions, for which 23 were significantly deregulated by metal exposures. The protein deregulation profiles were specific to each metal, providing evidence for metal-specific action sites and responses of gammarids. Among the tested metals, Cu was the most toxic in terms of mortality, probably linked with persistent oxidative stress. Moulting and osmoregulation were the major biological functions affected by Cu in the long-term. In Pb-exposed gammarids, significant deregulations of proteins involved in immune response and cytoskeleton were observed. Reproduction appears to be strongly affected in gammarids chronically exposed to Cd or Pb. Besides, modified expressions of several proteins involved in energy transfer and metabolism highlighted important energetic reshuffling to cope with chronic metal exposures. These results support the fact that metallic pressures induce a functional and energetic cost for individuals of G. fossarum with potential repercussions on population dynamics. Furthermore, this ecotoxicoproteomic study offers promising lines of enquiry in the development of new biomarkers that could make evidence of long-term impacts of metals on the health of organisms.

40|$|Purpose Much {{research}} has been <b>performed</b> <b>on</b> physical <b>exposures</b> during work (e. g. lifting, trunk flexion or body vibrations) as risk factors for low back pain (LBP), however results are inconsistent. Information {{on the effect of}} doses (e. g. spinal force or low back moments) on LBP may be more reliable but is lacking yet. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the prospective relationship of cumulative low back loads (CLBL) with LBP and to compare the association of this mechanical load measure to exposure measures used previously. Methods The current study was part of the Study on Musculoskeletal disorders, Absenteeism and Health (SMASH) study in which 1, 745 workers completed questionnaires. Physical load at the workplace was assessed by video-observations and force measurements. These measures were used to calculate CLBL. Furthermore, a 3 -year follow-up was conducted to assess the occurrence of LBP. Logistic regressions were performed to assess associations of CLBL and physical risk factors established earlier (i. e. lifting and working in a flexed posture) with LBP. Furthermore, CLBL and the risk factors combined were assessed as predictors in logistic regression analyses to assess the association with LBP. Results Results showed that CLBL is a significant risk factor for LBP (OR: 2. 06 (1. 32 - 3. 20)). Furthermore, CLBL had a more consistent association with LBP than two of the three risk factors reported earlier. Conclusions From these results it can be concluded that CLBL is a risk factor for the occurrence of LBP, having a more consistent association with LBP compared to most risk factors reported earlier. © 2012 The Author(s) ...|$|R
