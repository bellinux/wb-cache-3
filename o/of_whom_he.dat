5|$|Flanagan's early {{influences}} included Art Tatum and Teddy Wilson, both <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>he</b> {{heard on}} the radio and playing in the Detroit area, as well as Nat King Cole and local pianists Earl Van Riper and Willie Anderson. These, however, played in an earlier style, and the young Flanagan and his friends were more interested in the newer bebop, including that played by pianist Bud Powell, who had a strong effect on Flanagan's musical thinking and improvising.|$|E

5|$|Higgins {{played on}} minor hockey teams with former Canadiens {{teammate}} Mike Komisarek and former Flames teammate Eric Nystrom, both <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>he</b> remains close friends with. He {{was a student}} of Lithuanian hockey coach Aleksey Nikiforov at hockey camps in his teenage years. Though he grew up on Long Island, Higgins was a Montreal Canadiens fan as a child, following after his father; his favorite players on the team were goaltender Patrick Roy and captain Kirk Muller.|$|E
5|$|No {{images of}} Murrell survive. Accounts {{describe}} him as a short man who walked with {{his hands behind his}} back and hummed as he went. He was also noted for wearing a hard hat, bobbed tale coat, and iron goggles, while carrying a whalebone umbrella and a basket into which he placed the herbs that he collected. His appearance reportedly scared local children, <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>he</b> was nevertheless fond.|$|E
5|$|A polygamist, Idi Amin {{married at}} least six women, three <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>he</b> divorced. He married his first and second wives, Malyamu and Kay, in 1966. In 1967, he married Nora, and then married Nalongo Madina in 1972. On 26 March 1974, he {{announced}} on Radio Uganda that he had divorced Malyamu, Nora, and Kay. Malyamu was arrested in Tororo on the Kenyan border in April 1974 and accused of attempting to smuggle a bolt of fabric into Kenya. She later moved to London where she operates a restaurant in East London. In 1974, Kay Amin died under mysterious circumstances, with her body found dismembered. Nora fled to Zaire in 1979; her current whereabouts are unknown.|$|E

5|$|Although many Canadians {{have come}} to view Brock {{as one of their}} own, Brock never really felt at home in Canada. On the whole, he viewed the country as a backwater, and earnestly wished to return to Europe to fight against Napoleon. Brock mistrusted the Canadian colonists, many <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>he</b> {{suspected}} of being American sympathizers, and he was reluctant to arm them indiscriminately to help defend the colonies. He favoured expansion of volunteer forces which could be trained and supervised, as well as the use of British regulars and Tecumseh's warriors.|$|E
5|$|Coffin did {{not enjoy}} being {{in the public eye}} and {{considered}} his job soliciting financial aid as begging for money, which he thought to be demeaning. He stated in his autobiography that he gladly gave up the position once a new leader for the organization was selected. Coffin became concerned about giving money freely to all blacks, some <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>he</b> was believed {{would never be able to}} care for themselves unless adequate education and farms were provided. He also believed the Society should give their limited resources only to those who were best able to benefit from them. The Society continued to operate until 1870, the same year that black men were guaranteed the right to vote under the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Critics chastised Stewart for not {{conducting}} sufficiently hard-hitting {{interviews with}} his political guests, some <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>he</b> may have lampooned in previous segments. Stewart and other Daily Show writers responded to such criticism {{by saying that}} they do not have any journalistic responsibility and that as comedians their only duty is to provide entertainment. Stewart's appearance on the CNN show Crossfire picked up this debate, where he chastised the CNN production and hosts for not conducting informative and current interviews on a news network.|$|E

5|$|Crowley had {{his first}} {{significant}} mystical experience while on holiday in Stockholm in December 1896. Several biographers, including Lawrence Sutin, Richard Kaczynski, and Tobias Churton, believed {{that this was the}} result of Crowley's first same-sex sexual experience, which enabled him to recognise his bisexuality. At Cambridge, Crowley maintained a vigorous sex life with women—largely with female prostitutes, from one <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>he</b> caught syphilis—but eventually he took part in same-sex activities, despite their illegality. In October 1897, Crowley met Herbert Charles Pollitt, president of the Cambridge University Footlights Dramatic Club, and the two entered into a relationship. They broke apart because Pollitt did not share Crowley's increasing interest in Western esotericism, a break-up that Crowley would regret for many years.|$|E
5|$|From 1885 {{until his}} death in 1908 his work was {{dominated}} by prose and poems. The 1895 prose text Der Schmetterling contains autobiographical accounts. Peter's enchantment by the witch Lucinde, <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>he</b> regards himself a slave, is possibly in reference to Johanna Kessler. Peter, like Busch, returns to his birthplace. It is similar in style to the romantic travel story that Ludwig Tieck established with his 1798 Franz Sternbald's Wanderungen. Busch plays with its traditional forms, motifs, pictures, literary topics and form of narration.|$|E
5|$|Henry had a {{considerable}} sexual appetite and enjoyed {{a substantial number}} of sexual partners, resulting in a large number of illegitimate children, at least nine sons and 13 daughters, many <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>he</b> appears to have recognised and supported. It was normal for unmarried Anglo-Norman noblemen to have sexual relations with prostitutes and local women, and kings were also expected to have mistresses. Some of these relationships occurred before Henry was married, but many others took place after his marriage to Matilda. Henry had a wide range of mistresses from a range of backgrounds, and the relationships appear to have been conducted relatively openly. He may have chosen some of his noble mistresses for political purposes, but the evidence to support this theory is limited.|$|E

5|$|In April 1881, Mason, Brothers {{offered a}} cash prize of £300, {{to be known}} as the Walker Whiskey Trophy. The cash prizes {{attracted}} so many entrants that a series of preliminary heats was held during September 1881. Rush took part, but was eliminated from the final race. Rush also rowed a number of private matches at this time, notably against J. J. Power, Harry Pearce, both <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>he</b> beat, and Elias Laycock. The match against Laycock was for the Championship of Australia, which Laycock won with ease. Rush announced his retirement from sculling contests, not for the first or the last time.|$|E
5|$|In November, Carlsen {{participated in}} the European Team Chess Championship with the Norwegian team. He started off poorly, scoring ½ points out of 3 games, losing to Levon Aronian, drawing against Sune Berg Hansen, and losing again to Yannick Pelletier due to a blunder. However, he {{finished}} the tournament strongly, scoring victories against Peter Leko and Radoslaw Wojtaszek, the latter <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>he</b> had lost to earlier in the year, but his performance {{was not enough to}} earn his team a medal, and he lost 16 rating points during the event.|$|E
5|$|Jeunet hired French {{special effects}} {{supervisor}} Pitof and cinematographer Darius Khondji, both <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>he</b> {{had worked with}} on The City of Lost Children. Jeunet and his crew watched the latest science fiction and Alien films as reference material, and obtained production reports from the Alien films to study the camera setups. Jeunet was given creative control, contributing several elements to the script including five different endings, although the expensive ones were dismissed. He also opted to make the film a dark comedy and was encouraged to include more violence. In June 1996, Jeunet's frequent co-director, conceptual artist Marc Caro had drawn rough sketches of characters' costumes, which were shown to veteran costume designer Bob Ringwood. Ringwood made several modifications for the final design.|$|E

It is this group of individuals who become crucial in duping Parker into believing that he is actually a clone of himself created by the Jackal, while claiming that the clone – who comes to be known as Ben Reilly – is actually the original.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 1860, {{two members}} of the company's board of {{directors}} wrote a letter requesting Helm's resignation; they claimed they had voted for his re-election as president of the company with the understanding that he would resign when the main line between Louisville and Nashville was finished. Helm maintained that he felt an obligation to the citizens of Logan County – many <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>he</b> had personally sold stock to – to remain president until the Memphis branch through their county was built. The rift between Helm and the directors continued to widen, however. Helm resigned on February 21, 1860, and was replaced by James Guthrie. The Memphis branch was completed on September 24, 1860.|$|E
