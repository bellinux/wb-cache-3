40|$|Melanoidins {{are defined}} as {{polymeric}} high molecular weight, brown-coloured Maillard reaction end-products, containing nitrogen. They escape digestion and pass through the upper gastrointestinal tract and can interact with the different microbial species present in the colon. Major dietary sources of melanoidins are coffee and bread crust. Both coffee and bread crust melanoidins can be fermented by the human hindgut microflora thus sharing some of the properties attributed to dietary fibre. Despite the emerging positive physiological properties of such dietary constituents their intake has not been estimated yet. To this aim melanoidin content in different type of coffee brews, bread and <b>dry</b> <b>biscuits</b> was determined by sequential ultrafiltration and enzymatic digestion. Despite some drawbacks and limiting steps in the calculation, such as {{the lack of a}} reference material, an educated guess on the dietary intake of melanoidins has been put forward. Data indicated that the intake of coffee melanoidins ranged between 0. 5 to 2. 0 g per day for moderate and heavy consumers, respectively. For bread and <b>dry</b> <b>biscuits</b> an intake in the ranges of 1. 8 - 15. 0 and 3. 2 - 8. 5 g per day has been calculated. These figures suggest that a realistic estimation of melanoidins dietary intake for general population would be close to 10 g per day considering all the possible alimentary sources. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

40|$|As {{steviol glycosides}} are now allowed {{as a food}} {{additive}} in the European market, {{it is important to}} assess the stability of these steviol glycosides after they have been added to different food matrices. We analyzed and tested the stability of steviol glycosides in semi-skimmed milk, soy drink, fermented milk drink, ice cream, full-fat and skimmed set yoghurt, <b>dry</b> <b>biscuits</b> and jam. The fat was removed by centrifugation from the dairy and soy drink samples. Proteins were precipitated by addition of acetonitrile and also removed by centrifugation. Samples of jam were extracted with water. <b>Dry</b> <b>biscuits</b> were extracted with ethanol. The resulting samples were concentrated with solid phase extraction and analyzed by HPLC on a C 18 stationary phase and a gradient of acetonitrile / aqueous 25 mM phosphoric acid. The accuracy was checked using a standard addition on some samples. For assessing the stability of the steviol glycosides, samples were stored in conditions relevant to each food matrix and analyzed periodically. The results indicate that steviol glycosides can be analyzed with good precision and accuracy in these food categories. The recovery was between 96 and 103 %. The method was also vali-dated by standard addition, which showed excellent agreement with the external calibration curve. No sign of decomposition of steviol glycosides was found in any of the samples. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|In 1831, Carr {{formed a}} small bakery and biscuit {{factory in the}} English city of Carlisle; he {{received}} a royal warrant in 1841. Within fifteen years of being founded, {{it was the largest}} baking business in Britain. His business was both a mill and a bakery, an early example of vertical integration, and he produced bread by night and biscuits by day. The biscuits were loosely based on <b>dry</b> <b>biscuits</b> used on long voyages by sailors. They could be kept crisp and fresh in tins, and despite their fragility could easily be transported {{to other parts of the}} country by canal and railway.|$|R
50|$|The {{inflatable}} liferaft {{to which}} the crew escaped was 12 feet m in diameter, covered with an orange canopy, and equipped with tinned water, <b>dry</b> <b>biscuits,</b> some flares, two oars and a baling pail. In the rush to abandon ship, the emergency radio had been left on board the Blythe Star, however the crew expected to be quickly spotted by searchers or passing ships. This was not to be, and by several days into their ordeal the weather had worsened significantly. Keeping the raft upright and afloat took much effort, with big waves regularly collapsing the inflatable vessel onto itself, and water needing to be constantly bailed-out.|$|R

5000|$|Byron {{and other}} writers, {{such as his}} friend Hobhouse, {{described}} his eating habits in detail. At the time he entered Cambridge, he went on a strict diet to control his weight.

For most of his life he was a vegetarian, and often lived for days on <b>dry</b> <b>biscuits</b> and white wine. Occasionally he would eat large helpings of meat and desserts, after which he would purge himself.

Single pot dishes, which take less work to prepare, are popular. In Bergamo, Brescia, and Valtellina, polenta is common. In Valtellina, Pizzoccheri is common, also. In Mantua, festivals feature tortelli di zucca (ravioli with pumpkin filling) accompanied by melted butter and followed by turkey stuffed with chicken or other stewed meats.

40|$|Behavior of pectin and {{thermally}} denatured whey proteins {{at different}} protein/polysaccharide ratios and pH values was preliminarily investigated {{to determine the}} best experimental conditions for obtaining composite films. Experiments were carried out in the absence or presence of transglutaminase, an enzyme able to crosslink proteins by forming (-glutamyl) lysine isopeptide bonds (Porta R., CritRevFoodSciNutr. 51, 223, 2011). Our findings indicated the formation at pH 5. 1 (pHc) of transglutaminase-catalyzed crosslinks among soluble ionic whey protein/pectin complexes and the obtained hydrocolloid films showed good mechanical as well as water vapor and oxygen barrier properties. Application of the films by dip-coating technique allowed to create a layer on the surface of bakery foods, such as <b>dry</b> <b>biscuits</b> and donuts, and the effects of the performed coating in controlling food moisture transfer and oil uptake were evaluated. We observed a significant reduction of water absorption by <b>dry</b> <b>biscuits</b> which prevented the loss of their crispness, keeping normal the hardness parameters and improving the springiness and chewiness ones. It is well known that fried foods contain high amounts of fat, considered one of the major risk factors of developing heart diseases. We demonstrated that the coating of donuts by the pectin/whey protein films obtained in the presence of transglutaminase was able to reduce the water loss during the frying process by preventing water migration from the core to the crust of the donuts and, as a consequence, by filling the void that normally allows the fat to enter inside the food. Besides, coated donuts exhibited decreased fat uptake, reduced fat content and improved oil barrier index. In conclusion, the introduction of transglutaminase-catalyzed crosslinks among pectin/whey protein complexes obtained at pHc was shown to clearly confer to the hydrocolloid films good performance in acting as both water and oil absorption barrier for bakery foods...|$|R
