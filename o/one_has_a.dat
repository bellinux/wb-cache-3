5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the two types of}} classification within historic districts, properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are classified into five broad categories. They are, building, structure, site, district and object; each <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> specific definition in relation to the National Register. All but the eponymous district category are also applied to historic districts listed on the National Register.|$|E

30|$|Among the 12 {{patients}} for whom pneumonia was finally ruled out, alternative diagnosis was: intra-alveolar hemorrhage (n = 3), hemodynamic pulmonary edema (n = 2), a vacuo edema complicating pneumothorax exsufflation (n = 1), pulmonary fibrosis (n = 1), and {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome or acute lung injury related to extrapulmonary sepsis (n = 5). Of these five patients, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> infection of ascites with septic shock (PCT < 0.5 ng/mL), <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> pyelonephritis with septic shock (PCT > 10 ng/mL), <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> peritonitis with septic shock (PCT not available), <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> liver abscess without shock (PCT > 10 ng/mL), and <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> pyelonephritis without shock (PCT > 10 ng/mL).|$|R

5|$|Although double-hull {{design is}} {{superior}} in low energy casualties and prevents spillage in small casualties, in high energy casualties where both hulls are breached, oil can spill through the double-hull {{and into the}} sea and spills from a double-hull tanker can be significantly higher than designs like the mid-deck tanker, the Coulombi egg tanker and even a pre-MARPOL tanker, as the last <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> lower oil column and reaches hydrostatic balance sooner.|$|E
5|$|Aquinas {{reasoned}} that acting contrary to conscience is an evil action but an errant conscience is only blameworthy {{if it is}} the result of culpable or vincible ignorance of factors that <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> duty to have knowledge of. Aquinas also argued that conscience should be educated to act towards real goods (from God) which encouraged human flourishing, rather than the apparent goods of sensory pleasures. In his Commentary on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics Aquinas claimed it was weak will that allowed a non-virtuous man to choose a principle allowing pleasure ahead of one requiring moral constraint.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} livery {{variants}} were tested on scale models, which were later exposed at VR's conference centre at Helsinki central railway station: <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> red strip {{for the whole}} length of the train, with the window backgrounds painted grey. The other is more similar to the final result, but {{the front of the}} train includes more red and no grey paint at all. VR finally settled to a combination of both of them, which bore resemblance to the company's InterCity livery. The bottom of the carriages is dark grey, with a red stripe distinguishing it from the white base colour. The top of the carriages is painted grey. Red colouring {{at the end of each}} car forms red parallelograms when the carriages are combined. When asked why the trains were not blue and white, VR's CEO answered that red and white fits the train and its design the best.|$|E

5|$|Many mental states {{seem to be}} {{experienced}} subjectively in different ways by different individuals. And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since no <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly {{how it feels to}} hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{necklaces}} features lion-headed terminals, {{and another}} includes stylized dolphins. The other four are relatively plain loop-in-loop chains, although <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> Chi-Rho symbol (☧) on the clasp, the only Christian {{element in the}} jewellery. Necklaces of similar lengths would normally be worn in the Roman period with a pendant, but no pendants {{were found in the}} hoard. The three rings were originally set with gems, which might have been natural gemstones, or pieces of coloured glass; however, these were taken from the rings before they were buried, perhaps for reuse. The rings are of similar design, one with an oval bezel, one with a circular bezel, and one with a large oblong bezel.|$|E

30|$|At BL, all {{subjects}} were evaluated by a self-reported questionnaire for knee pathology and prior knee injuries that required surgical intervention. <b>One</b> female adolescent <b>had</b> <b>an</b> ACL tear that had been surgically repaired. Two adolescent males and two adolescent females had patellar pain syndrome. Eight adults had prior knee surgery. Among the adult males, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lateral meniscectomy, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> lateral and medial meniscectomies and articular cartilage debridement, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> other knee surgery, and <b>one</b> <b>had</b> cartilage debridement and a meniscus surgery. Among the adult females, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> nerve transection and knee cartilage debridement, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> knee arthroscopy, <b>one</b> <b>had</b> meniscus surgery, and <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> medial meniscectomy. <b>One</b> male adult reported pain below the patella, and two adult females had knee pain. No subjects experienced injuries between BL and 2 -year FU. Biomarker levels and patient-rated outcomes were compared between adults with and without prior knee injury to determine how this variable influenced results.|$|R
5|$|The person's {{understanding}} {{of his or}} her mental illness is evaluated by exploring his or her explanatory account of the problem, and {{understanding of}} the treatment options. In this context, insight can be said to have three components: recognition that <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on a continuum, the clinician should not describe it as simply present or absent, but should report the patient's explanatory account descriptively.|$|E
5|$|There are {{approximately}} 460 globular clusters {{associated with the}} Andromeda Galaxy. The most massive of these clusters, identified as Mayall II, nicknamed Globular <b>One,</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> greater luminosity than any other known globular cluster in the Local Group of galaxies. It contains several million stars, and is about twice as luminous as Omega Centauri, the brightest known globular cluster in the Milky Way. Globular One (or G1) has several stellar populations and a structure too massive for an ordinary globular. As a result, some consider G1 to be the remnant core of a dwarf galaxy that was consumed by Andromeda in the distant past. The globular with the greatest apparent brightness is G76 which {{is located in the}} south-west arm's eastern half.|$|E
5|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, and as {{originally}} described by , Rule 184 {{may be used to}} model deposition of particles onto a surface. In this model, <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> set of particles that occupy a subset of the positions in a square lattice oriented diagonally (the darker particles in the figure). If a particle is present at some position of the lattice, the lattice positions below and to the right, and below and {{to the left of the}} particle must also be filled, so the filled part of the lattice extends infinitely downward to the left and right. The boundary between filled and unfilled positions (the thin black line in the figure) is interpreted as modeling a surface, onto which more particles may be deposited. At each time step, the surface grows by the deposition of new particles in each local minimum of the surface; that is, at each position where it is possible to add one new particle that has existing particles below it on both sides (the lighter particles in the figure).|$|E
