40|$|International audienceDuring {{the last}} decade, piezoelectric-based microresonators {{have shown a}} great {{interest}} in the micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) field, especially for biosensing applications. Micromembranes have revealed a particular potential for biological experiments [1]. In order to optimize their design, the analytical modeling of their dynamic behavior is of critical importance. We report the elaboration of an analytical model for the case of a micromembrane with piezoelectric actuation and detection vibrating either in air or in a viscous fluid. The model, based on an equivalent electrical circuit, enables the computation of specific characteristics like mass sensitivity, resonance frequency and minimum detectable mass. The model was established for a five-layer stack membrane with a circular lead zirconate titanate 46 / 54 PbZrxTi 1 -xO 3 (PZT) active cell (Fig 1). The method was based on the separation of the membrane's electromechanical behaviour into three parts. First, a purely mechanical transfer function, linking the force exerted on the membrane by the piezoelectric layer to the relative displacement of the membrane, was determined[2]. Then, the actuation coupling coefficient was determined by relating the applied voltage and moment applied to the membrane [3]. Finally, the sense electromechanical coupling coefficient is found linking the deflection of the membrane and the resulting charge creation at <b>output</b> <b>electrode.</b> The global admittance, resulting from the merging of the three previous parameters corresponds to an equivalent electrical circuit modeling the vibrations of the piezoelectric membrane in air. We also realised the implementation of the model for the case of vibration in a viscous fluid by adding two extra equivalent electrical components modelling the effects of the surrounding fluid (a. k. a fluidic resistance and inductance) respectively corresponding to the damping and added mass induced by the fluid. The final equivalent electrical circuit allows the determination of theoretical values for the membranes' characteristics as biosensors. The fabrication process has been described in details elsewhere [4] and a top view of a membrane's chip is shown on fig 2. The dynamic behaviours of fabricated membranes, with a 100 µm global radius and piezoelectric cell radius of 30, 50 and 70 µm, have been extracted experimentally. The curves for real and imaginative part of the complex admittance were obtained with a HP 4294 A impedance analyzer. The comparison between experimental and theoretical behaviour is reported for the three types of membranes and good agreement between the theoretical experimental curves is observed for the case of vibrations in air (Fig 3). In the case of operation in fluid, good accordance in amplitude is observed even though a constant shift in frequency (8 %) between theoretical and experimental values still remains as shown on fig 4.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this poster is to demonstrate the limitations on temporal {{information that can be}} imposed by a cochlear implant (CI) processor which employs the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to decompose the signal. The Nucleus 24 processor increases temporal information with increased stimulation rate by increasing the temporal overlap between FFT analyses (increases FFT rate). Benefits to performance with higher stimulation rates have been shown in some cases (Holden et al., 2002), but there is little evidence to determine whether improved performance (where it occurs) is due to genuine increases in temporal information in the processor output. The study reported here aimed to determine changes in <b>electrode</b> <b>output</b> with increasing FFT rate, and to evaluate the possible perceptual effects of this via an acoustic model. In order to achieve the first aim, sinusoids modulated at varying modulation rates (at 100 % modulation depth) were processed through the Nucleus Matlab Toolbox in order to simulate the processing of the Nucleus 24 system. The modulation depth of the resulting <b>electrode</b> <b>output</b> was analysed for each modulation rate. The resulting temporal modulation transfer functions will be reported for three different FFT rates, but preliminary analysis shows only small differences across FFT rates. A corresponding acoustic model study was also undertaken. Processed sentence materials were presented monaurally to 10 normal hearing subjects via an ER- 3 insert earphone. The speech materials were processed through the same software as used for the acoustic measurements, in order to the mimic the processing of the Nucleus 24 device implementing the Advanced Combination Encoder speech processing strategy (Cochlear, 2002), at three FFT rates equivalent to stimulation rates of 250, 900 and 2000 pulses per second.
