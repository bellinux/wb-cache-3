2500|$|Hydrogenation is {{a useful}} means for {{converting}} unsaturated compounds into saturated derivatives. [...] Substrates include not only alkenes and alkynes, but also aldehydes, imines, and nitriles, which are converted into the corresponding saturated compounds, i.e. alcohols and amines. [...] Thus, alkyl aldehydes, which can be synthesized with the <b>oxo</b> <b>process</b> from carbon monoxide and an alkene, {{can be converted to}} alcohols. E.g. 1-propanol is produced from propionaldehyde, produced from ethene and carbon monoxide. Xylitol, a polyol, is produced by hydrogenation of the sugar xylose, an aldehyde. Primary amines can be synthesized by hydrogenation of nitriles, while nitriles are readily synthesized from cyanide and a suitable electrophile. For example, isophorone diamine, a precursor to the polyurethane monomer isophorone diisocyanate, is produced from isophorone nitrile by a tandem nitrile hydrogenation/reductive amination by ammonia, wherein hydrogenation converts both the nitrile into an amine and the imine formed from the aldehyde and ammonia into another amine.|$|E

The reaction mixture is separated in a falling film evaporator from volatile components.

50|$|The Exxon process, also Kuhlmann- or PCUK - <b>oxo</b> <b>process,</b> is {{used for}} the hydroformylation of C6-C12 olefins. The process relies on cobalt catalysts. In order to recover the catalyst, an aqueous sodium {{hydroxide}} solution or sodium carbonate is added to the organic phase. By extraction with olefin and neutralization by addition of sulfuric acid solution under carbon monoxide pressure the metal carbonyl hydride can recovered. This is stripped out with syngas, absorbed by the olefin, and returned to the reactor.

50|$|Hydroformylation, {{also known}} as oxo {{synthesis}} or <b>oxo</b> <b>process,</b> is an industrial process {{for the production of}} aldehydes from alkenes. The process was developed by the German chemist Otto Roelen in 1938, who discovered the reaction on which the process is based during his investigations of the Fischer-Tropsch process. This chemical reaction entails the net addition of a formyl group (CHO) and a hydrogen atom to a carbon-carbon double bond. This process has undergone continuous growth since its invention: Production capacity reached 6.6×106 tons in 1995. It is important because aldehydes are easily converted into many secondary products. For example, the resulting aldehydes are hydrogenated to alcohols that are converted to plasticizers or detergents. Hydroformylation is also used in speciality chemicals, relevant to the organic synthesis of fragrances and drugs. The development of hydroformylation, which originated within the German coal-based industry, {{is considered one of the}} premier achievements of 20th-century industrial chemistry.|$|E
50|$|After {{earning his}} Ph.D. in 1961, he {{immediately}} {{went to work}} for Union Carbide Corporation. He spent the next 39 years there, retiring in 2000. His career at Union Carbide was multi-dimensional: he did fundamental research in organic chemistry in an industrial setting, contributing to Union Carbide’s research and development program through his scientific innovations. His early work involved the vinyl acetate process, research on rhodium and acrylic acid work. He served as a technical witness for Union Carbide in lawsuits involving maritime arbitration, industrial accidents, and participated with the firm’s attorneys in intellectual property development. He was innovative {{in the development of a}} method of producing vinyl acetate without halide, and later benzyl acetate, acrylic acid, and rhodium triphenylphosphite in the <b>oxo</b> <b>process.</b> Union Carbide recognized his leadership skills as he was on the selection team for new chemists, mentored them throughout their careers and was instrumental in implementing continuing education programs for all employees. He received numerous promotions and was the youngest Union Carbide appointment to Senior Corporate Fellow. He won the prestigious Union Carbide Chairman’s award three times. He is listed as inventor on more than 90 U.S. patents. Some thirteen of these were filed after his retirement from Union Carbide. During his career at Union Carbide, he pursued approximately thirty-five different processes, nine of which reached commercial operation. Currently there are 27 licensees worldwide using technology he assisted in developing. Dr. Bryant is considered to be one of the world’s experts in separating product from precious metal with the use of a homogeneous catalyst.|$|E
40|$|There {{is still}} some {{uncertainty}} about the mechanism of increased bleachability by interstage activation of two-stage oxygen delignification (the <b>OxO</b> <b>process).</b> To possibly help in understanding the chemistry of the <b>OxO</b> <b>process,</b> residual lignin in kraft pulp bleached by oxygen and peracetic acid was extracted by the diox-ane/water acidolysis method. The content of functional groups in the extracted lignin was determined by 13 C-and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. For isothermally cooked kraft pulp, no significant difference {{could be seen in}} the chemical properties of residual lignin extracted with the dioxane/water acidolysis method. These data do not provide a chemical rationalization of the differ-ences in bleachability between oxygen delignified (O) and peracetic acid treated (OPa) pulp. For polysulfide/ AQ kraft pulp cooked to high kappa numbers, the changes in functional group content is in accordance with studies performed on lignin model compounds. The results suggest that the increased bleachability of peracetic acid treated kraft-oxygen pulps is not a con-sequence of the content of functional groups in the lignin...|$|E
40|$|The family {{approach}} for related compounds {{can be used}} to evaluate hazard and estimate reference concentrations/doses using internal dose metrics for a group (family) of metabolically related compounds. This approach is based upon a simple four-step framework for organizing and evaluating toxicity data: 1) expo-sure, 2) tissue dosimetry, 3) mode of action, and 4) response. Expansion of the traditional exposure-response analysis has been increasingly incorporated into regulatory guidance for chemical risk assessment. The family approach represents an advancement in the planning and use of toxicity testing that is intended to facilitate the maximal use of toxicity data. The result is a meth-odology that makes toxicity testing and the development of ac-ceptable exposure limits as efficient and effective as possible. An example is provided using butyl acetate and its metabolites (bu-tanol, butyraldehyde, and butyrate), widely used chemicals pro-duced synthetically by the industrial <b>oxo</b> <b>process.</b> A template pharmacokinetic model has been developed that comprises sub-models for each compound linked in series. This preliminary model is being used to coordinately plan toxicity studies, pharma-cokinetic studies, and analyses to obtain reference concentrations/ doses. Implementation of the family approach using pharmacoki-netic modeling to obtain tissue dose metrics is described and its applications are evaluated.

40|$|Automatically {{generating}} {{chemical reaction}} pathways {{is a significant}} computational challenge, {{particularly in the case}} where a given chemical system can exhibit multiple reactants and products, as well as multiple pathways connecting these. Here, we outline a computational approach to allow automated sampling of chemical reaction pathways, including sampling of different chemical species at the reaction end-points. The key features of this scheme are (i) introduction of a Hamiltonian which describes a reaction “string” connecting reactant and products, (ii) definition of reactant and product species as chemical connectivity graphs, and (iii) development of a scheme for updating the chemical graphs associated with the reaction end-points. By performing molecular dynamics sampling of the Hamiltonian describing the complete reaction pathway, we are able to sample multiple different paths in configuration space between given chemical products; by periodically modifying the connectivity graphs describing the chemical identities of the end-points we are also able to sample the allowed chemical space of the system. Overall, this scheme therefore provides a route to automated generation of a “roadmap” describing chemical reactivity. This approach is first applied to model dissociation pathways in formaldehyde, H 2 CO, as described by a parameterised potential energy surface (PES). A second application to the HCo(CO) 3 catalyzed hydroformylation of ethene (<b>oxo</b> <b>process),</b> using density functional tight-binding to model the PES, demonstrates that our graph-based approach is capable of sampling the intermediate paths in the commonly accepted catalytic mechanism, as well as several secondary reactions. Further algorithmic improvements are suggested which will pave the way for treating complex multi-step reaction processes in a more efficient manner...|$|E
