25|$|A typical {{flush toilet}} is a vitreous, ceramic bowl {{containing}} water, plus plumbing to rapidly {{fill it with}} more water. The water in the toilet bowl is connected to a hollow drain pipe shaped like an upside-down U connecting the drain. One side of the U channel is arranged as a hollow siphon tube longer than {{the water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The top of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. If water is poured slowly into the bowl it simply flows <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the upside-down U and pours slowly down the drainâ€”thus the toilet does not flush. The standing water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas coming out of the sewer through the drain, and also as a receptacle for waste. Sewer gas is vented through a separate vent pipe attached to the sewer line.|$|E
25|$|A {{steep and}} rough slope descends north east {{from the summit}} of Green Gable, {{dropping}} through Mitchell Cove to the flat-topped and rather damp col of Blackmoor Pols (1,995ft). Beyond this the ground rises again to the steep sided dome of Base Brown. On the south eastern face are crags overlooking Styhead Gill with Seathwaite Fell across the valley. The north western flanks are equally steep, but descending only half the vertical distance into the hanging valley of Gillercomb. This is the gathering ground of Sour Milk Gill, which drops over a series of falls around the northern extremity of Base Brown. Here it joins Styhead Gill and Grains Gill to form the nascent River Derwent. Across Gillercomb is the main ridge continuing north around Ennerdale, Brandreth being the initial fell. The top of Base Brown narrows considerably {{to the north of}} the summit, a prow-like ridge descending toward the falls of Sour Milk Gill. There is a prominent hanging stone here, startlingly poised <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the crags. Another feature is the Seathwaite Slabs, a set of slabs of rocks used for rock climbing practice by novices and conveniently located only minutes from Seathwaite.|$|E
500|$|Rincewind and Twoflower are {{eventually}} washed rimwards {{to the kingdom}} of Krull, which lies on the very rim of the disc, where they are taken prisoner. The astronomers and [...] "astrozoologists" [...] of Krull have for many years attempted to determine the sex of Great A'Tuin, and {{are on the verge}} of launching a space vehicle to carry a pair of [...] "cosmo" [...] on a new mission <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the disc. [...] Unaware of this, Rincewind and Twoflower take the place of the two cosmonauts and 'escape' to the spacecraft, which they accidentally launch, catapulting them off the rim. [...] The prospect of losing the eighth spell in this fashion prompts the Octavo to act, causing A'Tuin to perform a barrel roll to recapture Rincewind, landing the pair near the centre of the disc. Watching the Octavo's restlessness, the Archchancellor reveals his intention to use the Rite of AshkEnte to ask Death about the Octavo and also about a large red star that has recently appeared in the sky. [...] Now knowing all he needs, Trymon throws Weatherwax from the Tower of Art and becomes Archchancellor in his place.|$|E

50|$|Some Dichondra {{species are}} {{cultivated}} as ornamental plants, with cultivar selections also available. Dichondra micrantha {{is used as}} a groundcover.

The Dichondra argentea 'Silver Falls' cultivar is often used for trailing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> <b>of</b> potted plants, and has lower water needs.|$|R
60|$|The place seemed deserted, for at {{that time}} of day no country people were at Millville; but on passing down the aisle the visitor {{approached}} a little office built {{at the rear of the}} store.

60|$|<b>Over</b> <b>the</b> black <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clarendon Mill to the eastward the sky {{had caught}} fire. The sun had risen, the bells were ringing riotously, resonantly in the clear, cold air. Another working day had begun.|$|R
6000|$|Pris was not behindhand in her efforts, but {{worked in}} a {{different}} way, and got up a branch society among her little pupils, called [...] "The Water Babies." [...] That captivated the mothers at once, and even the fathers {{found it difficult to}} enjoy their wine with blue eyes watching them wistfully <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> <b>of</b> silver mugs; while the few topers of the town hid themselves like night-birds flying from the sun, when, led by their gentle General, that little army of innocents marched through the streets with banners flying, blithe voices singing, rosy faces shining, and childish hearts full of the sweet delusion that they could save the world.|$|R
500|$|On October 22, 2006, at 3:13p.m. PST, a {{magnitude}} 3.5 earthquake broke loose Spine 7. The collapse and avalanche of the lava dome sent an ash plume [...] <b>over</b> <b>the</b> western <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crater; the ash plume then rapidly dissipated.|$|R

50|$|Rabbits and rodents {{are also}} obligate nasal breathers.

Even so, rabbits with advanced upper airway disease will attempt to breathe through their mouths.|$|R
60|$|Sharkey, the abominable Sharkey, was out again. After {{two years}} of the Coromandel coast, his black barque of death, The Happy Delivery, was prowling off the Spanish Main, while trader and fisher flew for dear life at the menace of that patched fore-topsail, rising slowly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> violet <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{tropical}} sea.|$|R
60|$|An hour later, when I {{came down}} to my canoe, he was sitting low on the lily pads, winking sleepily now and then, with eight little sparrow's toes curling <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> his under lip, like a hornpout's whiskers.|$|E

60|$|Up {{he drove}} and up, to that {{pulsating}} rhythm, until the country beneath was blue and indistinct, and London spread {{like a little}} map traced in light, like the mere model of a city near the brim of the horizon.

6000|$|Mr. Cave, greatly perturbed by the irruption, looked angrily at her <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> <b>of</b> his spectacles, and, without {{excessive}} assurance, asserted {{his right}} to manage his business in his own way. An altercation began. The two customers watched the scene with interest and some amusement, occasionally assisting Mrs. Cave with suggestions. Mr. Cave, hard driven, persisted in a confused and impossible story of an enquiry for the crystal that morning, and his agitation became painful. But he stuck to his point with extraordinary persistence. It was the young Oriental who ended this curious controversy. He proposed that they should call again {{in the course of}} two days--so as to give the alleged enquirer a fair chance. [...] "And then we must insist," [...] said the clergyman, [...] "Five pounds." [...] Mrs. Cave took it on herself to apologise for her husband, explaining that he was sometimes [...] "a little odd," [...] and as the two customers left, the couple prepared for a free discussion of the incident in all its bearings.|$|R
60|$|There is {{a garden}} {{in that city}} we were bound to, sanded below with clean sand, the trees meeting overhead, some of them trimmed, some pleached, and the whole place beautified with alleys and arbours. Here I left Catriona, and went forward by myself to find my correspondent. There I drew on my credit, and asked to be {{recommended}} to some decent, retired lodging. My baggage not being yet arrived, I told him I supposed I should require his caution {{with the people of}} the house; and explained that, my sister being come for a while to keep house with me, I should be wanting two chambers. This was all very well; but the trouble was that Mr. Balfour in his letter of recommendation had condescended on a great deal of particulars, and never a word of any sister in the case. I could see my Dutchman was extremely suspicious; and viewing me <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> <b>of</b> a great pair of spectacles--he was a poor, frail body, and reminded me of an infirm rabbit--he began to question me close.|$|R
5000|$|Colt had {{produced}} a revolver for the U.S. Army called the M1909, {{a version of}} their heavy-frame, [...]45-caliber, New Service model in [...]45 M1909, {{a version of the}} [...]45 Long Colt with an enlarged rim to facilitate extraction, to supplement and replace a range of 1890s-era [...]38 caliber Colt and Smith & Wesson revolvers that had demonstrated inadequate stopping power during the Philippine-American War. The Colt M1917 Revolver was a New Service with a cylinder bored to take the [...]45 ACP cartridge and the half-moon clips to hold the rimless cartridges in position. Later production Colt M1917 revolvers had headspacing machined into the cylinder chambers, just as the Smith & Wesson M1917 revolvers had from the start. Newer Colt production could be fired without the half-moon clips, but the empty cartridge cases had to be ejected with a device such as a cleaning rod or pencil, as the cylinder extractor and ejector would pass <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rimless cartridges. During its lifetime, the Colt New Service was the most popular revolver made by Colt, surpassing 150,000 units. After World War I, the revolver gained a strong following among civilian shooters.|$|R
