5|$|Other {{possibilities}} {{to synthesize}} nuclei {{on the island}} <b>of</b> <b>stability</b> include quasifission (partial fusion followed by fission) of a massive nucleus. Such nuclei tend to fission, expelling doubly magic or nearly doubly magic fragments such as calcium-40, tin-132, lead-208, or bismuth-209. Recently {{it has been shown}} that the multi-nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei (such as uranium and curium) might be used to synthesize the neutron-rich superheavy nuclei located at the island <b>of</b> <b>stability,</b> although formation of the lighter elements nobelium or seaborgium is more favored. One last possibility to synthesize isotopes near the island is to use controlled nuclear explosions to create a neutron flux high enough to bypass the gaps of instability at 258–260Fm and at mass number 275 (atomic numbers 104 to 108), mimicking the r-process in which the actinides were first produced in nature and the gap of instability around radon bypassed. Some such isotopes (especially 291Cn and 293Cn) may even have been synthesized in nature, but would have decayed away far too quickly (with half-lives of only thousands of years) and be produced in far too small quantities (about 10−12 the abundance of lead) to be detectable as primordial nuclides today outside cosmic rays.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Power {{systems are}} {{subjected}} to various types of disturbances which cause the problem <b>of</b> losing <b>stability.</b> The problem <b>of</b> transient <b>stability</b> is a crucial problem. Transient <b>stability</b> evaluation <b>of</b> large scale power systems is an extremely intricate and highly non-linear problem. The main causes <b>of</b> transient <b>stability</b> {{may be due to}} transmission system faults, sudden fault changes, loss of generating units and line switching. So the enhancement <b>of</b> transient <b>stability</b> is essential for a secure power system operation. Transient <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> a system refers to the stability when subjected to large disturbances such as faults and switching <b>of</b> lines. Transient <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> the system can be improved by increasing the system voltage, increasing the X/R ratio, increasing the number of parallel lines between points and placement of the FACTS devices. The FACTS controller can improve the voltage stability, steady-state and transient <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> a power system. UPFC (Unified Power Flow Controller) and SSSC (Static Synchronous Series Compensator) can improve the transient <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> the system. Simulation <b>of</b> transient <b>stability</b> without and with FACTS device was done using MATLAB based program and the analysis is performed on IEEE 6 bus system...|$|R
