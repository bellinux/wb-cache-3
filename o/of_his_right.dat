5|$|Caracciola {{was carried}} on a chair to the local tobacco shop, and from there {{he went to the}} hospital. He had {{sustained}} multiple fractures <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> thigh, and his doctors doubted he would race again. He transferred to a private clinic in Bologna, where his injured leg remained in a plaster cast for six months. Caracciola defied the predictions of his doctors and healed faster than expected, and in the winter Charlotte took her husband back to Arosa, where the altitude and fresh air would aid his recovery.|$|E

The injury occurred two days before his official transfer deal to Fiorentina had been finalised, and it seriously threatened his career, at age 18. Although several team doctors feared he would not play again, Fiorentina retained their faith in him, agreeing to commit to the transfer as well as fund the required surgery, one of many reasons for Baggio's attachment to the club.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{days after}} his OHL return, Hodgson {{suffered}} another injury, breaking a toe on his right foot while blocking a shot against the Sudbury Wolves. Initial X-rays came up negative and he continued playing for nine more games before a second X-ray revealed a hairline fracture in one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> metatarsal bones. Missing the Battalion's final five regular season games, he finished the campaign with eight goals and 20 points over 13 contests. Despite missing {{the majority of the}} season, he was voted as the smartest player in the Eastern Conference for the third consecutive year in the OHL coaches poll.|$|E

There, Nicolls regrouped at Prospect Bluff, and rallied Indians and refugee ex-slaves living free in Florida, recruiting the latter into his detached unit of the Corps of Colonial Marines.|$|E
5|$|Nova {{struggled}} {{in his first}} four starts of the 2013 season, in which he failed to pitch past the fifth inning, pitching to a 1–1 record and a 6.28 ERA. On April 27, 2013, Nova {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list after an MRI revealed he had inflammation <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> triceps. Nova was activated on May 24, 2013, and demoted to the bullpen. He pitched an immaculate inning on May 29, 2013 against the New York Mets.

5|$|Pope John XXII, {{elected in}} 1316, sought Edward's {{support for a}} new crusade, and was also {{inclined}} to support him politically. In 1317, in exchange for papal support in his war with Scotland, Edward agreed to recommence paying the annual Papal tribute, which had been first agreed by King John in 1213; Edward soon ceased the payments, however, and the King never offered his homage, {{another part of the}} 1213 agreement. In 1325 Edward asked Pope John to instruct the Irish Church to openly preach in favour <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> to rule the island, and to threaten to excommunicate any contrary voices.|$|E

5|$|At Bordeaux, Gourcuff quickly {{asserted}} {{himself into}} the squad for the 2008–09 season scoring on his league debut against Caen in a 2–1 victory and also helping Bordeaux capture their 2nd Trophée des champions title. He scored Bordeaux's 4th and final goal in the team's 4–0 triumph over Vannes in the Coupe de la Ligue final. Gourcuff also provided the assist on the third goal. He scored two goals in Bordeaux's Champions League campaign against Roma and CFR Cluj. On 11 January 2009, Gourcuff scored a goal that was voted {{the goal of the}} season by fans against Paris Saint-Germain in a 4–0 victory. Upon receiving the ball from teammate Matthieu Chalmé, just outside the box, Gourcuff performed a swift Marseille turn, eluding PSG defender Sylvain Armand, followed by quickly shifting the ball from his right foot to his left causing Sammy Traoré to lose balance, before bringing the ball back to his right foot and blasting it past Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Mickaël Landreau with the outside <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> foot.|$|E
5|$|At the interval, Liverpool defender Mark Wright was {{replaced}} by Steve Harkness. Nine minutes into the second-half, Liverpool scored their goal; Jason McAteer played the ball towards McManaman, running at the Newcastle defence in their penalty box and picking out a pass to Fowler, who scored his second goal of the match. Liverpool's advantage only lasted for two minutes; Asprilla, put through by Robert Lee, scored with the outside <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> boot. Newcastle began to dominate territorially and missed a chance to increase their lead shortly after Asprilla's goal: Ginola's misplaced final ball failed to reach an incoming Ferdinand. Liverpool continued to press forward and in the 65th minute levelled the score again; McAteer's curling cross confused the Newcastle defence and reached Collymore, who took a shot past goalkeeper Pavel Srníček.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> hand were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from {{the view of the}} bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
5|$|Clark's major {{military}} achievements occurred before his thirtieth birthday. Afterwards, he led militia {{in the opening}} engagements of the Northwest Indian War but was accused of being drunk on duty. He was disgraced and forced to resign, despite his demand for a formal investigation into the accusations. He left Kentucky {{to live on the}} Indiana frontier but was never fully reimbursed by Virginia for his wartime expenditures. He spent the final decades of his life evading creditors and living in increasing poverty and obscurity. He was involved in two failed attempts to open the Spanish-controlled Mississippi River to American traffic. He became an invalid after suffering a stroke and the amputation <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> leg.
