40|$|A new {{approach}} {{to the study of}} the parametric rolling of ships in a following sea is presented. The new aspect is the consideration of the interference of surge with the roll dynamics. When the waves are long and steep, the oscillatory component of the surge velocity can become large when compared with the mean value. As the <b>oscillatory</b> <b>surge</b> grows in amplitude, it tends also to become asymmetric due to the existence of nonlinearity The nature of asymmetric surging is such that a ship spends more time on the crests than on the troughs of the waves. This means, however, that the probability of capsize is increased because a ship's roll-restoring capability around the crest is at a minimum. We propose a new second-order differential equation of roll which incorporates automatically the surge effect through appropriate position-dependent coefficients. We explore numerically how this asymmetry in surge influences the build up of parametric rolling. The layout of the stability transition lines of the coupled system was found to be notably different from that of a Mathieu-type system. We pay attention also to the vicinity of surf-riding, where the capsize is more of a 'pure-loss' type...|$|E
40|$|The wave-induced {{collisions}} and rafting of ice floes are investigated experimentally and theoretically. Results from {{a series}} of wave basin experiments are presented. Ice floes are simulated experimentally using thin plastic disks. The first round of experiments focusses on measuring the <b>oscillatory</b> <b>surge,</b> heave, pitch and drift motions of solitary floes. The second and third rounds of experiments record the motions of two adjacent floes. Rafting is suppressed in the second round, and allowed in the third round. Collision and rafting regimes are identified, and collision behaviours are quantified over a range of incident wavelengths and wave amplitudes. Two mathematical models are proposed to model the wave-induced motions of solitary floes. The first is based on slope-sliding theory, and the second is based on linear potential-ow theory. Both models are validated using results from the single-floe experiments. Model-data comparisons show that the slope-sliding model is valid in the long-wavelength regime, and potential-ow model is more accurate in shorter wavelengths. A two-floe collision model is then developed to replicate the conditions of the two-floe experiments. Slope-sliding theory is used to model floe motions. A time-stepping algorithm is implemented to determine the occurrence of collision and rafting events. Predicted collision behaviours are compared with results from the two-floe experiments. Good agreement is attained in incident waves of intermediate to long wavelengths. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Mathematical Sciences, 2017...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} {{high-voltage}} equipment encompasses {{the study of}} <b>oscillatory</b> <b>surges</b> caused by transients such as those produced by switching. By obtaining a model, the response of which reconstructs that observed in the actual system, simulation studies and critical tests {{can be carried out}} on the model rather than on the equipment itself. In this paper, methods for the construction of simplified models are described and it is shown how the use of a complex model does not necessarily result in superior response pattern reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|International audienceResults {{from the}} Heinrich Event INtercOmparison (HEINO) {{topic of the}} Ice-Sheet Model Intercomparison Project (ISMIP) are presented. ISMIP HEINO was {{designed}} to explore internal large-scale ice-sheet instabilities in different contemporary ice-sheet models. These instabilities are of interest because they are a possible cause of Heinrich events. A simplified geometry experiment reproduces the main characteristics of the Laurentide ice sheet, including the sedimented region over Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait. The model experiments include a standard run plus seven variations. Nine dynamic/thermodynamic ice-sheet models were investigated; one of these models contains {{a combination of the}} shallow-shelf (SSA) and shallow-ice approximation (SIA), while the remaining eight models are of SIA type only. Seven models, including the SIA-SSA model, exhibit <b>oscillatory</b> <b>surges</b> with a period of âˆ¼ 1000 years for a broad range of parameters, while two models remain in a permanent state of streaming for most parameter settings. In a number of models, the oscillations disappear for high surface temperatures, strong snowfall and small sediment sliding parameters. In turn, low surface temperatures and low snowfall are favourable for the ice-surge cycles. We conclude that further improvement of ice-sheet models is crucial for adequate, robust simulations of cyclic large-scale instabilities...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of the 1928 St. Francis Dam failure in southern California was accomplished using a 2 D Godunov-type finite-volume shallow-water algorithm run on an unstructured grid of triangular cells. The model {{was found to}} be accurate based on historical accounts, including flood maps and arrival time data, and sensitivity analysis was performed to determine factors that control the predictability of flooded area and flood arrival times. Results show that predictions of flood arrival times are sensitive to both mesh resolution and Manning coefficient (used to scale flow resistance), while predictions of flooded area were found to be relatively insensitive to the Manning coefficient. These results suggest that bed resistance controlled the speed of the St. Francis flood while flooded area was controlled by topography and the volume of released water. The study also revealed two types of previously unreported <b>oscillatory</b> <b>surging</b> in the dam-break flood. The first is due to a standing wave that develops in a tortuous reach of channel downstream of the dam. The wave is excited by reflections off canyon walls and accounts for a 30 % fluctuation in discharge. The second is due to a mode-two standing wave in the reservoir. This wave is caused by the reflection of dam-break rarefaction waves off reservoir walls, and accounts for only 2 - 3 % fluctuation in discharge. Both oscillations are therefore shown to be physically based and should not beinterpreted as spurious oscillations common to many numerical wave models...|$|R
