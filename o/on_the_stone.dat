5|$|After it {{fell into}} disuse during the Bronze Age, Maeshowe was re-opened and used centuries later by Vikings from about the 9th to the 12th centuries AD. The Norsemen left {{a series of}} runic {{inscriptions}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> walls of the chamber, {{some of which were}} left by a group of crusaders in the winter of 115354. Over thirty individual inscriptions remain, one of the largest such collections in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Djedkare {{seems to}} have been held in high esteem during the Sixth Dynasty. For example, Merenre Nemtyemsaf I chose to place his pyramid complex close to that of Djedkare. In addition, the South Saqqara Stone, a royal annal dating to the reign of Merenre or of his {{successor}} Pepi II, records rich offerings being made to Djedkare on behalf of the king. An estimated 92% of the text inscribed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> was lost when it was roughly polished to be reused as a sarcophagus lid, possibly in the late First Intermediate (c. 2160–2055 BC) to early Middle Kingdom period (c. 2055–1650 BC).|$|E
5|$|From Leicester {{the march}} moved to Market Harborough. This {{was one of}} the least {{welcoming}} of all the overnight stops. No member of the local council greeted or visited the marchers, and they were forced to spend the night <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> floor of an unfinished building (the local press later denied that this was so). On Saturday 24 October the marchers reached Northampton, arriving {{at the same time as}} the blind group. Wilkinson left to supervise arrangements in London, and would thereafter only participate intermittently until the final day, a week hence.|$|E

5|$|Manampisoa {{was one of}} the {{residence}}s of queens Rasoherina, RanavalonaII and RanavalonaIII, {{the last}} three monarchs of the Kingdom of Madagascar. Once complete, Manampisoa was used by Rasoherina as her primary residence but the queen was only able to inhabit the house for approximately one year before dying in April 1868. After Rasoherina's death, her successor, RanavalonaII, used the building as a temporary worship space during work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> chapel. Upon the collapse of the monarchy following French colonisation, the colonial authority transformed Manampisoa into a museum of Malagasy culture.|$|E
5|$|The Tjängvide image stone {{from the}} Baltic island of Gotland, Sweden {{features}} a rider on an eight-legged horse, {{which may be}} Odin's eight-legged horse Sleipnir, being greeted by a female, which may be a valkyrie at Valhalla. The 11th century runestone U 1163 features a carving of a female bearing a horn that has been interpreted as the valkyrie Sigrdrífa handing the hero Sigurd (also depicted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone)</b> a drinking horn.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{itself was}} {{occupied}} by {{a unit of the}} Royal Armoured Corps, who served as observers; the soldiers appear to have relied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> walls for protection rather than trenches, and, unusually, no additional firing points were cut out of the stonework, as typically happened elsewhere. The surrounding beaches were defended with lines of barbed wire, slit trenches and square weapons pits, reinforced by concrete pillboxes to the north and south of the castle, at least partially laid down by the 1st Battalion Essex Regiment.|$|E

Overall, Borobudur has 2,033 surfaces of stone stairs, spread over four cardinal directions; including the west side, the east, south and north. There are around 1,028 surfaces of them, or about 49.15 percent are severely worn out.|$|E
5|$|Work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> now {{focused on}} fuller {{understanding}} of the texts and their contexts by comparing the three versions with one another. In 1824 Classical scholar Antoine-Jean Letronne promised to prepare a new literal translation of the Greek text for Champollion's use. Champollion in return promised an analysis of all the points at which the three texts seemed to differ. Following Champollion's sudden death in 1832, his draft of this analysis could not be found, and Letronne's work stalled. François Salvolini, Champollion's former student and assistant, died in 1838, and this analysis and other missing drafts were found among his papers. This discovery incidentally demonstrated that Salvolini's own publication <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone,</b> published in 1837, was plagiarism. Letronne was at last able to complete his commentary on the Greek text and his new French translation of it, which appeared in 1841. During the early 1850s, German Egyptologists Heinrich Brugsch and Max Uhlemann produced revised Latin translations based on the demotic and hieroglyphic texts. The first English translation followed in 1858, the work of {{three members of the}} Philomathean Society at the University of Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{feature on}} the wall of the front porch on the ground floor is a foot print on a stone slab. It is said that this foot print belonged to a {{resident}} of the monastery, who was a water carrier, known as Chitenpa. He served in the monastery for a long time and on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> slab which created a dented formation of his step. This step is venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by a divine person who was a true devotee of the monastery.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th Dynasty, prince Khaemwaset, {{a son of}} Ramesses II, {{undertook}} restoration works throughout Egypt on pyramids and temples {{which had}} fallen into ruin. Inscriptions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> cladding of the pyramid of Sahure show that it was restored at this time. This is possibly because, from the mid 18th Dynasty onwards, the mortuary temple of Sahure served as a sanctuary for the goddess Sekhmet. In {{the second part of}} the 18th Dynasty and during the 19th Dynasty numerous visitors left inscriptions, stelae and statues in the temple. Activities seemed to have continued on-site for a long time, as shown by graffiti dating from the 26th Dynasty (664525 BC) until the Ptolemaic period (33230 BC).|$|E
5|$|Hastings was commemorated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> laid {{below the}} Petone Anzac Memorial Flagstaff {{by members of}} the New Zealand Railways Department. The {{memorial}} was {{the focal point of the}} first public Anzac Day remembrance ceremony in New Zealand on 25 April 1916, which was attended by the Prime Minister of New Zealand, William Massey, and other members of Parliament. Even though Hastings' death had not been confirmed at the time, it is believed that the desire to commemorate him was a key motivation in the erection of the memorial. Hastings' name is also included on the Memorial Tablet engraved with the names of 446 New Zealand Railways Department workers who were killed during World War I, which was unveiled in the Railways Head Office at Wellington on 28 April 1922 by the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, it was {{reported}} that the stone was unearthed during the installation of electrical road (likely for a tram) and restored to its original location by the Woonsocket chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

5|$|Silvestre de Sacy {{eventually}} gave up work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone,</b> {{but he was}} to {{make another}} contribution. In 1811, prompted by discussions with a Chinese student about Chinese script, Silvestre de Sacy considered a suggestion made by Georg Zoëga in 1797 that the foreign names in Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions might be written phonetically; he also recalled that as early as 1761, Jean-Jacques Barthélemy had suggested that the characters enclosed in cartouches in hieroglyphic inscriptions were proper names. Thus, when Thomas Young, foreign secretary of the Royal Society of London, wrote {{to him about the}} stone in 1814, Silvestre de Sacy suggested in reply that in attempting to read the hieroglyphic text, Young might look for cartouches that ought to contain Greek names and try to identify phonetic characters in them.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} {{was reported in}} September in Courrier de l'Égypte, the official newspaper of the French expedition. The anonymous reporter expressed a hope that the stone might one day {{be the key to}} deciphering hieroglyphs. In 1800, three of the Commission's technical experts devised ways to make copies of the texts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone.</b> One of these experts was Jean-Joseph Marcel, a printer and gifted linguist, who is credited as the first to recognise that the middle text was written in the Egyptian Demotic script, rarely used for stone inscriptions and seldom seen by scholars at that time, rather than Syriac as had originally been thought. It was artist and inventor Nicolas-Jacques Conté who found a way to use the stone itself as a printing block to reproduce the inscription. A slightly different method was adopted by Antoine Galland. The prints that resulted were taken to Paris by General Charles Dugua. Scholars in Europe were now able to see the inscriptions and attempt to read them.|$|E
5|$|Alt US40 {{branches}} from US40 near exit 14 on I-68 at Keysers Ridge. It {{runs parallel}} to I-68 through northern Garrett County as a two-lane road with truck lanes on some uphill sections. The annual {{average daily traffic}} (AADT)—that is, the number of cars that use the road per day, averaged {{over the course of}} one year—is 1,831 at the western end of Alt US40. For comparison, the parallel section of I-68 has an AADT of 14,271. Alt US40 passes through some of the most mountainous terrain in Maryland. The route runs perpendicular to the mountain ridges in Garrett County, and as a result much of the section of the road in Garrett County runs uphill or downhill. The first mountain encountered by the highway east of Keysers Ridge is Negro Mountain. The road passes over the mountain at an elevation of , which is the highest point on Alt US40, and was also the highest point along the National Road. East of Negro Mountain, the highway enters Grantsville, where traffic increases, with the AADT increasing to 3,711, the highest traffic density on Alt US40 in Garrett County. In Grantsville, Alt US40 meets MD669, which connects with Pennsylvania Route 669 toward Salisbury, Pennsylvania. A short distance east of this intersection, the highway meets MD495, which junctions with I-68 and continues southward toward Oakland. East of Grantsville, Alt US40 passes over the Casselman River on a steel bridge built in 1933. Downstream from this bridge is the Casselman River Bridge State Park, centered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> arch bridge which originally carried the National Road over the Casselman River.|$|E

5|$|Kingship had its ritual aspects. The Scottish {{kings of}} Dál Riata were inaugurated by putting their {{foot in a}} {{footprint}} in stone, signifying that they would {{follow in the footsteps}} of their predecessors. The Kingdom of Alba, unified in the ninth century and which would develop into the kingdom of Scotland, had Scone and its sacred stone at the heart of its coronation ceremony, which historians presume was inherited from Pictish practice, but which was claimed to date back to the first arrival of the Scottish kings from Ireland. It was here that Scottish kings before the wars of independence were crowned, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> of Scone, before its removal by Edward I in 1296. The first ceremony for which details survive is that for Alexander III in 1249. They describe a ceremony that combined elements of ancient heritage, the Church and secular lordship. He was consecrated by the Bishop of St Andrews and placed on the throne by the Mormaers of Strathearn and Fife and his genealogy recited in Gaelic back to his Dalriadric Scottish ancestors by a royal poet from the Highlands. There was no anointment or crowning ceremony, as was common elsewhere in Europe. Later kings seem to have resented this omission and attempted to remedy it by appeals to the Pope. However, Scottish kings are usually depicted wearing crowns and carrying the normal regalia associated with kingship.|$|E
5|$|Liestøl {{suggested}} that the three men were somehow related to Ölvir. Liestøl noted that three names were those of characters in the Orkneyinga saga, which all had connections with the Hebrides. Kali was the original name of Earl Rögnvaldr, whom Ölvir fought for. The earl was named after his grandfather, Kali Sæbjörnarson, who according to the saga, accompanied Magnús 'Barefoot' to the Hebrides, and died there of wounds he received on Anglesey. According to Liestøl, the name Fugl, in a West Norse context, is only found on this inscription and of a minor character in the saga. This character {{was the son of}} Ljótólfr, from Lewis, who negotiated a truce between Sveinn Ásleifarson and Earl Óttarr. In 1922, historian Alan Orr Anderson noted that the mediaeval Chronicle of Man records that Fogolt, sheriff of Man, died in 1183, and Anderson stated that it is possible that Ljótólfr's son was the mentioned sheriff. Concerning the name Ljótólfr, Liestøl also noted that the saga names Ölvir's father Þorljót, and his maternal-grandfather Ljótr. He concluded that the men mentioned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> likely lived around the year 1000, about four to six generations before their namesakes in the saga. In consequence, Liestøl {{suggested that}} Kali Sæbjörnarson would have been a contemporary of the children of the rune-stone's Kali Ölvisson. The stone, among many others, is housed in the museum at Iona Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Scottish coronations were {{traditionally}} held at Scone Abbey, {{with the}} king seated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> of Destiny. The original rituals were a fusion of ceremonies used by the kings of Dál Riata, based on the inauguration of Aidan by Columba in 574, and by the Picts from whom the Stone of Destiny came. A crown {{does not seem to}} have been used until the inauguration of AlexanderII in 1214. The ceremony included the laying on of hands by a senior cleric and the recitation of the king's genealogy. AlexanderIII was the last Scottish king to be crowned in this way in 1249, since the Stone was captured by the English forces of Edward I in 1296. It was later incorporated into the English Coronation Chair and its first certain use at an English coronation was that of HenryIV in 1399. Pope JohnXXII in a bull of 1329 granted the kings of Scotland the right to be anointed and crowned. No record exists of the exact form of the medieval rituals, but a later account exists of the coronation of the 17-month-old infant JamesV at Stirling Castle in 1513. The ceremony was held in a church, since demolished, within the castle walls and was conducted by the Bishop of Glasgow, because the Archbishop of StAndrews had been killed at the Battle of Flodden. It is likely that the child would have been knighted before the start of the ceremony. The coronation itself started with a sermon, followed by the anointing and crowning, then the coronation oath, in this case taken for the child by an unknown noble or priest, and finally an oath of fealty and acclamation by the congregation.|$|E
