40|$|We have {{analyzed}} transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (pol II) in {{a highly}} efficient in vitro transcription system composed of essentially homogeneous protein preparations. The pol II complex was stalled on adenovirus major late promoter templates at defined positions, and the <b>open</b> <b>region</b> and RNA products of these complexes were examined. The first transition is formation of the open complex, which can be reversed by addition of ATPgammaS. The <b>open</b> <b>region</b> is no longer sensitive to ATPgammaS after formation of a four-nucleotide RNA, which constitutes the second transition. This indicates that the ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity of TFIIH is required to maintain the <b>open</b> <b>region</b> only during formation {{of the first three}} phosphodiester bonds. The downstream part of the transcription bubble expands in a continuous motion, but the initially <b>opened</b> <b>region</b> (- 9 /- 2 on the non-template strand) recloses abruptly when transcription reaches register 11. This third transition is accompanied by a switch from abortive to productive RNA synthesis, which implies promoter clearance. Our findings provide a framework to analyze regulation of these specific transitions during transcription initiation by pol II...|$|R

6000|$|In North America, {{the large}} and {{handsome}} Danais archippus, with rich reddish-brown wings, is very common; and it is closely imitated by Limenitis misippus, a butterfly allied to our [...] "white admiral," [...] but which has acquired a colour quite distinct {{from that of the}} great bulk of its allies. In the same country there is a still more interesting case. The beautiful dark bronzy green butterfly, Papilio philenor, is inedible both in larva and perfect insect, and it is mimicked by the equally dark Limenitis ursula. There is also in the Southern and Western States a dark female form of the yellow Papilio turnus, which in all probability obtains protection from its general resemblance to P. philenor. Mr. W.H. Edwards has found, by extensive experiment, that both the dark and yellow females produce their own kinds, with very few exceptions; and he thinks that the dark form has the advantage in the more <b>open</b> <b>regions</b> and in the prairies, where insectivorous birds abound. But in open country the dark form would be quite as conspicuous as the yellow form, if not more so, so that the resemblance to an inedible species would be there more needed.[103] ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{would have}} been already {{possible}} {{at that time to}} have distinguished the main racial divisions of mankind as we know them to-day. Across the warm temperate regions of this rather warmer and better-wooded world, and along the coasts, stretched the brownish peoples of the Heliolithic culture, the ancestors of the bulk of the living inhabitants of the Mediterranean world, of the Berbers, the Egyptians and of much of the population of South and Eastern Asia. This great race had of course a number of varieties. The Iberian or Mediterranean or [...] "dark-white" [...] race of the Atlantic and Mediterranean coast, the [...] "Hamitic" [...] peoples which include the Berbers and Egyptians, the Dravidians; the darker people of India, a multitude of East Indian people, many Polynesian races and the Maoris are all divisions of various value of this great main mass of humanity. Its western varieties are whiter than its eastern. In the forests of central and northern Europe a more blonde variety {72} of men with blue eyes was becoming distinguishable, branching off from the main mass of brownish people, a variety which many people now speak of as the Nordic race. In the more <b>open</b> <b>regions</b> of northeastern Asia was another differentiation of this brownish humanity {{in the direction of a}} type with more oblique eyes, high cheek-bones, a yellowish skin, and very straight black hair, the Mongolian peoples. In South Africa, Australia, in many tropical islands in the south of Asia were remains of the early negroid peoples. The central parts of Africa were already a region of racial intermixture. Nearly all the coloured races of Africa to-day seem to be blends of the brownish peoples of the north with a negroid substratum.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to analyze}} the pattern and process of {{distribution}} of cities in the newly <b>opened</b> <b>regions</b> by tracing the historical changes of the urban system in Hokkaido, Japan and in the Republic of South Africa.

Second stage is the growth period: the ex-ploitation made great progress in inland regions and the coastal cities and inland cities were in conflict with each other.
