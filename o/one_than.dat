5|$|Before the season, Juventus manager Claudio Ranieri {{remarked that}} Del Piero would have {{as good a}} season, or an even better <b>one,</b> <b>than</b> the {{previous}} term. In August 2008, Del Piero {{announced that he would}} try to keep playing professional football with Juventus until he turned 40. Juventus were drawn into the same Champions League group as Real Madrid, and UEFA Cup winners Zenit Saint Petersburg. Del Piero marked Juventus's return to the competition with a match-winning free kick to seal a home win against Zenit. On 21 October, Del Piero netted a notable goal as Juventus defeated Real Madrid 2–1 in Turin, scoring with a first-time, curling strike from distance, in the fifth minute of play.|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between chlorine and iodine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Bond energies to bromine tend to be lower than those to chlorine but higher than those to iodine, and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger <b>one</b> <b>than</b> iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). Bromination often leads to higher oxidation states than iodination but lower or equal oxidation states to chlorination. Bromine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Br bonds.|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{the third}} halogen, being a nonmetal in group 17 of the {{periodic}} table. Its properties are thus {{similar to those of}} fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, and tend to be intermediate between those of the two neighbouring halogens, chlorine and iodine. Bromine has the electron configuration 3d104s24p5, with the seven electrons in the fourth and outermost shell acting as its valence electrons. Like all halogens, it is thus one electron short of a full octet, and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell. Corresponding to periodic trends, it is intermediate in electronegativity between chlorine and iodine (F: 3.98, Cl: 3.16, Br: 2.96, I: 2.66), and is less reactive than chlorine and more reactive than iodine. It is also a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine, but a stronger <b>one</b> <b>than</b> iodine. Conversely, the bromide ion is a weaker reducing agent than iodide, but a stronger <b>one</b> <b>than</b> chloride. These similarities led to chlorine, bromine, and iodine together being classified as one of the original triads of Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner, whose work foreshadowed the periodic law for chemical elements. It is intermediate in atomic radius between chlorine and iodine, and this leads to many of its atomic properties being similarly intermediate in value between chlorine and iodine, such as first ionisation energy, electron affinity, enthalpy of dissociation of the X2 molecule (X = Cl, Br, I), ionic radius, and X–X bond length. The volatility of bromine accentuates its very penetrating, choking, and unpleasant odour.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between fluorine and bromine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Chlorine is a weaker oxidising agent than fluorine but a stronger <b>one</b> <b>than</b> bromine or iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). However, this trend is not shown in the bond energies because fluorine is singular due to its small size, low polarisability, and lack of low-lying d-orbitals available for bonding (which chlorine has). As another difference, chlorine has a significant chemistry in positive oxidation states while fluorine does not. Chlorination often leads to higher oxidation states than bromination or iodination but lower oxidation states to fluorination. Chlorine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Cl bonds.|$|E
5|$|The script {{revealed}} that a frame story indeed {{was part of the}} original Caligari screenplay, albeit a significantly different <b>one</b> <b>than</b> that in the final film. The original manuscript opens on an elegant terrace of a large villa, where Francis and Jane are hosting a party, and the guests insist that Francis tell them a story that happened to him 20 years earlier. The conclusion to the frame story is missing from the script. Critics widely agree that the discovery of the screenplay strongly undermines Kracauer's theory, with some, like German film historian Stephen Brockmann, even arguing it disproves his claims altogether. Others, however, like John D. Barlow, argues it does not completely settle the issue, as the original screenplay's frame story simply serves to introduce the main plot, rather than subvert it as the final film's version does.|$|E

500|$|Historian J. Birkenmeier has {{recently}} argued that John's reign {{was the most}} successful of the Komnenian period. In [...] "The development of the Komnenian army 1081–1180", he stresses the wisdom of John's approach to warfare, which focused on siege warfare rather than risky pitched battles. Birkenmeier argues that John's strategy of launching annual campaigns with limited, realistic objectives was a more sensible <b>one</b> <b>than</b> that followed by his son Manuel I. According to this view, John's campaigns benefited the Byzantine Empire because they protected the empire's heartland from attack while gradually extending its territory in Asia Minor. The Turks were forced onto the defensive, while John kept his diplomatic situation relatively simple by allying with the Western Emperor against the Normans of Sicily.|$|E
500|$|Angharad Llwyd, writing before St Ceidio's was rebuilt, {{referred}} to it as a [...] "small edifice" [...] in a [...] "dreary spot". The 19th-century writer Samuel Lewis, describing the rebuilt church, was more complimentary: [...] "The expense of the re-edification was very moderate; the ancient foundations were preserved, the same stones were used, and though the present building is a much better <b>one</b> <b>than</b> the former, its style is strictly the same." [...] However, he too thought that the church was in a [...] "dreary spot". The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited the church in 1851.

500|$|Later on, critics {{felt that}} the Xbox One's {{functionality}} had matured over the year following its launch; Jeff Bakalar of CNET, assigning it a score of 8/10, acknowledged improvements to Xbox One's software since its original release, but that its user interface was still unintuitive in comparison to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 4, explaining that [...] "navigating the interface seems {{to be much more}} problematic than it rightfully should be, and there's simply not enough transparency in the logic within it.
