The computational results show that the proposed algorithms perform extremely well on all these three types of shop scheduling problems.

40|$|Abstract: Unlike {{implemented}} in other production systems, dispatching in an <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> not only {{takes into account}} the job priority at each machine but also the selection of the next ma-chine for any jobs leaving the current machine. The control mechanism for scheduling in an <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> can be utilized by a dispatching rule-pair that consists of a machine-selection rule and a job-dispatching rule. This study conducts a steady-state simulation comparison on the perform-ance of 39 dispatching rule-pairs in <b>open</b> <b>shops.</b> We find that using NINQ as the ma-chine-selection rule can minimize the mean flowtime of jobs while using LINQ as the ma-chine-selection rule can minimize mean tardiness of jobs for most cases. The choice of the best dispatching rule-pair depends on the selected performance criterion as well as the system’s con-figurations such as utilization factor, number of machines, and processing time distribution of jobs. Finally, under similar system configurations, the best job-dispatching rule in an <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> is different from that of a job shop...|$|R

The quality of the solutions is evaluated by a lower bound for the corresponding preemptive <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> problem and by an alternative estimate of mean flow time.
