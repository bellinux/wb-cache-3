Feacal coliforms {{were used as}} indicators of bacterial pollution while phosphate, nitrate, silicate and oxygen were used as indicators of possibe nutrient enrichment in the bay. Also monitored were salinity, temperature and depth. Measurements were done on surface waters. Sea-surface temperatures ranged from 2. 2 to 9. 7 ºC increasing towards the sewage <b>outlets.</b> <b>Oxygen</b> values ranged from 6. 23 to 9. 66 mg/l. Salinlity measurements were generally low and ranged from 15. 59 to 32. 79 PSU. The counts of feacal coliform were generally high with the counts ranging between 170 to> 16, 000 MPN/ 100 ml. The bacterial counts were higher close to the sewage outlets and decreased with distance from the sewage outlets. Feacal coliform counts were above the limits recommended by European Community Bathing Water Directive (1976) for drinking and bathing and Icelandic regulation for several water uses and may present potential risk to human health. However, it should be mentioned that this monitoring was undertaken when most adverse effects would be expected regarding feacal coliforms since it was the darkest period {{of the year when}} bacteria die-off time is longest and during the low tide close to spring tide when influence of freshwater and sewage is high...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We have {{developed}} a perfusion bioreactor system that allows the formation of steady state oxygen gradients in cell culture. In this study, gradients were formed in cultures of rat hepatocytes to study the role of oxygen in modulating cellular functions. A model of oxygen transport in our flat-plate reactor was developed to estimate oxygen distribution at the cell surface. Experimental measurements of <b>outlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration from various flow conditions were used to validate model predictions. We showed that cell viability was maintained over a 24 -h period when operating with a physiologic oxygen gradient at the cell surface from 76 to 5 mmHg O 2 at the <b>outlet.</b> <b>Oxygen</b> gradients have been implicated in the maintenance of regional compartmentalized metabolic and detoxification functions in the liver, termed zonation. In this system, physiologic oxygen gradients in reactor cultures contributed to a heterogeneous distribution of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (predominantly localized upstream) and cytochrome P 450 2 B (predominantly localized downstream) that correlates with the distribution of these enzymes in vivo. The oxygen gradient chamber provides a means of probing the oxygen effects in vitro over a continuous range of O 2 tensions. In addition, this system serves as an in vitro model of zonation that could be further extended to study the role of gradients in ischemia–reperfusion injury, toxicity, and bioartificial liver design. © 2003 Wile...|$|R

The heating and oxidizing experiments of the coal samples are conducted, on the inlet oxygen concentration at 1. 9 %, 6. 0 %, 10. 3 %, 15. 1 % and 20. 0 % respectively, to detect the <b>outlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration in the heating process. Supported by the experimental data, the formulas of the standard oxygen consumption rate are deduced respectively to obtain the change law of the oxidation rate of each coal sample. The {{results show that the}} standard oxygen consumption rates are basically equal under different inlet oxygen concentration at the same temperature, which verifies the correctness of the coal-oxygen compound theory. What’s more, the curve of the standard oxygen consumption rate with the temperature rising can be divided as the slow oxidation phase, the accelerated oxidation phase and the violent oxidation phase in sequence. The results of the research have a theoretical and practical significance for preventing the spontaneous fire of coal in goaf.

In this paper, a modified one-dimensional steady-state analytical fuel cell model is used. The logarithmic mean of the inlet and the <b>outlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> partial pressure is adopted to avoid underestimating the effect of air stoichiometry. And the pressure drop model in the grid-distributed flow field is included in the stack analysis. Combined with the coordinate change preprocessing and analog technique, neural network is used to treat the MAP of compressor and turbine in the air system. Three kinds of air system topologies, the pure screw compressor, serial booster and exhaust expander are analyzed in this article. A real-code genetic algorithm is programmed to obtain the global optimum air stoichiometric ratio and the cathode outlet pressure. It is shown that the serial booster and expander with the help of exhaust recycling, can improve more than 3 % in the FCS efficiency comparing to the pure screw compressor. As the net power increases, the optimum cathode outlet pressure keeps rising and the air stoichiometry takes on the concave trajectory. The working zone of the proportional valve is also discussed. This presented work is helpful to the design of the air system in fuel cell system. The steady-state optimum can also be used in the dynamic control. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Considering {{the huge}} {{potential}} and eco-friendly nature of solar energy, solar fuel production {{by means of}} two step water splitting redox cycles has gathered attention in the research community. Reaching high cycle efficiency {{is one of the}} biggest challenges towards the development of such process cycles. The non-stoichiometric reduction extent of the water splitting material heavily depends on the partial pressure of oxygen. By lowering the partial pressure of oxygen during the reduction, the non-stoichiometric reduction extent will be increased, which in turn increases the amount of fuel production. A novel method has been developed to increase the efficiency of the partial pressure reduction. In this method, the partial pressure of oxygen was lowered by thermochemical oxygen pumping at reduced total pressure. The main aim of this study is to demonstrate the working principle of the thermochemical oxygen pump. Initially, a piping and instrumentation diagram was created based on the process requirements. Based on that, the components/sensors has been selected and procured accordingly. The experimental test stand was later constructed by integrating all the components together. The acquisition and storage of the measured sensor values is carried out by means of a LabVIEW program created for the test stand with necessary data acquisition modules. The experiments were carried out in the presence/absence of the pumping material. During the re-oxidation step, a carrier gas containing 1040 ppm was passed through the splitting material. Based on the <b>outlet</b> <b>Oxygen</b> concentration measured by the mass spectrometer, the amount of oxygen absorbed by the Splitting material was calculated. From this value, the non-stoichiometric reduction extent of the Splitting material was evaluated. The experimental results indicate that there was no significant improvement in the reduction extent of the material. The air leakage and the diffusion factors were found to be the limiting factors for the implementation of this technology. The experiments and the analysis of the results helped to understand the insights of the pumping process and the limitations of the current system design.

40|$|Despite the {{significant}} advances in tissue engineering (TE) research {{there is still}} a very limited number of regularly used clinical applications in this area. One of the reasons for this difficult transition is thelack of consistent product quality caused by inadequately controlled production systems. This thesis was performed within the scope of an interdisciplinary research program on bone TE which aims at developing and quantitatively evaluating clinically relevant osteoinductive TE constructs. Within this context a model-based feedback control strategy was proposed for perfusion bioreactors. This strategy was based on (i) using control inputs (like flow rate or oxygen concentration) to create a well defined micro-environment, (ii) on-line measurements of the cell response to its process environment and (iii) data-based mechanistic models of the input/output relation which could be used to continuously adjust the control inputs of the bioreactor {{in such a way that}} the outputreaches the desired value. The aim of this thesis was to develop the tools which make such process control possible for bone TE. In the light of this aim, a 2 D+ perfusion bioreactor concept was developed, which allows to use microscopic imaging of cells in a 3 D-like environment. This bioreactor system was validated for human periosteum derived cells (hPDCs) on a titanium scaffold made with additive manufacturing. Next, acombination of experiments and modelling was used to quantify the fluidflow environment in this 2 D+ scaffold during perfusion. Subsequently, an image processing algorithm was developed to quantify cell number and cell distribution. This algorithm could be used for images of the 2 D+ scaffolds, but also for other typical TE scaffolds, like hydro gels and 3 D titanium scaffolds. These tools (2 D+ bioreactor, fluid flow quantification and image based cell counting) were used together to study theeffect of fluid flow induced shear stress on hPDCs cultured on 2 D+ titanium scaffolds. Finally, a data-based modelling approach was used to characterize the dynamic response (change in <b>outlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration) of a bioreactor to changes in flow rate and inlet oxygen concentration. In conclusion, during this work several innovative tools were developed and validated to study the concepts of process control for bone TEbioreactors. It shows how quantification of the micro-environment and the local cell response can lead to a better insight in the complex process of 3 D cell culture. In a next step, the knowledge and methods developed in this thesis can be used to design model-based feedback control strategies for perfusion bioreactors. nrpages: 196 status: publishe...|$|R

Due to duct geometry and dimensions, areas {{of high and low}} O 2 concentrations in the flue gas duct occur, which poses a problem in obtaining a representative measurement of O 2 in the flue gas stream. Multipoint systems as opposed to single point systems are more favourable to achieve representative readings. However, ash blockages and air leakages influence the accuracy of O 2 measurement. The design of multipoint system varies across ESKOMs’ Power Stations.

Effluent and wastewater samples were collected respectively at the plant outlet and in the receiving environment, and physico-chemical analyses carried out revealed an organic pollution with a high pollution load that can be observed by phosphate levels in water at the plant <b>outlet.</b> Biochemical <b>oxygen</b> demand (BOD 5) is high at the plant outlet (20300 mg of O 2 / L) and 16200 mg of O 2 / L are found in the receiving environment. The BOD 5 /COD (chemical oxygen demand) ratio of effluents discharged by FERMENCAM and that of the receiving environment is 0. 90. This value is higher than 0. 5, meaning that the organic matter of both effluents is highly biodegradable. The results show that the increase in conductivity and decrease in total dissolved salts are due to an excessive mineralization of organic matters.

The {{purpose of this}} study is to evaluate hemodynamics and TAL function under simulated rest and exercise conditions in normal and pulmonary hypertension sheep models. METHODS: The TAL, the MC 3 Biolung (MC 3, Inc, Ann Arbor, MI), was attached between the pulmonary artery and left atrium in nine normal sheep and eight sheep with chronic pulmonary hypertension. An adjustable band was placed around the distal pulmonary artery to control the percentage of cardiac output (CO) diverted to the TAL. Pulmonary system hemodynamics and TAL function were assessed at baseline (no flow to the TAL) and with approximately 60 %, 75 %, and 90 % of CO diverted to the TAL. Intravenous dobutamine (0, 2, and 5 mcg. kg(- 1). min(- 1)) was used to simulate rest and exercise conditions. RESULTS: At 0 and 2 mcg. kg(- 1). min(- 1), CO did not change significantly with flow diversion to the TAL for both models. At 5 mcg. kg(- 1). min(- 1), CO decreased with increasing TAL flow up to 28 % +/- 5 % in normal sheep and 23 % +/- 5 % in pulmonary hypertension sheep at 90 % flow diversion to the artificial lung. In normal sheep, the pulmonary system zeroth harmonic impedance modulus, Z(0), increased with increasing flow diversion. In hypertensive sheep, Z(0) decreased at 60 % and 75 % flow diversion and returned to baseline levels at 90 %. The TAL <b>outlet</b> blood <b>oxygen</b> saturation was 95 % or greater under all conditions.

40|$|Growing {{concerns}} over {{greenhouse gas emissions}} have driven extensive research into new power generation cycles that enable carbon dioxide capture and sequestration. In this regard, oxy-fuel combustion is a promising new technology for capturing carbon dioxide in power generation systems utilizing hydrocarbon fuels. Combustion of a fuel {{in an environment of}} oxygen and recycled combustion gases yields flue gases consisting predominantly of carbon dioxide and water. To capture carbon dioxide, water is condensed, and carbon dioxide is purified and compressed beyond its supercritical state. However, conventional atmospheric oxy-fuel combustion systems require substantial parasitic energy in the compression step within the air separation unit, a flue gas recirculation system and carbon dioxide purification and compression units. Moreover, a large amount of flue gas latent enthalpy, which has high water concentration, is wasted. Both lower the overall cycle efficiency. Alternatively, pressurized oxy-fuel combustion power cycles have been investigated. In this thesis, the analysis of an oxy-fuel combustion power cycle that utilizes a pressurized coal combustor is reported. We show that this approach is beneficial in terms of larger flue gas thermal energy recovery and smaller parasitic power requirements. In addition, we find the pressure dependence of the system performance to determine the optimal combustor operating pressure for this cycle. (cont.) We calculate the energy requirements of each unit and determine the pressure dependence of the water-condensing thermal energy recovery and its relation to the gross power output. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted on important operating parameters including combustor temperature, Heat Recovery Steam Generator <b>outlet</b> temperature, <b>oxygen</b> purity and oxygen concentration in the flue gases.

40|$|Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrobacter winogradskyi (strain “Engel”) {{were grown}} in ammonia-limited and nitrite-limited conditions, respectively, in a retentostat with {{complete}} biomass retention at 25 °C and pH 8. Fitting the retentostat biomass and oxygen consumption data of N. europaea and N. winogradskyi to the linear equation for substrate utilization resulted {{in up to}} eight-times-lower maintenance requirements compared to the maintenance energy demand (m) calculated from chemostat experiments. Independent of the growth rate {{at different stages of}} such a retention culture, the maximum specific oxygen consumption rate measured by mass spectrometric analysis of inlet and <b>outlet</b> gas <b>oxygen</b> content always amounted to approximately 45 μmol of O 2 mg− 1 of biomass-C · h− 1 for both N. europaea and N. winogradskyi. When bacteria were starved for different time periods (up to 3 months), the spontaneous respiratory activity after an ammonia or nitrite pulse decreased with increasing duration of the previous starvation time period, but the observed decrease was many times faster for N. winogradskyi than for N. europaea. Likewise, the velocity of resuscitation decreased with extended time periods of starvation. The increase in oxygen consumption rates during resuscitation referred to the reviving population only, since in parallel no significant increase in the cell concentrations was detectable. N. europaea more readily recovers from starvation than N. winogradskyi, explaining the occasionally observed nitrite accumulation in the environment after ammonia becomes available. From chloramphenicol (100 μg · ml− 1) inhibition experiments with N. winogradskyi, it has been concluded that energy-starved cells must have a lower protein turnover rate than nonstarved cells. As pointed out by Stein and Arp (L. Y. Stein and D. J. Arp, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 64 : 1514 – 1521, 1998), nitrifying bacteria in soil have to cope with extremely low nutrient concentrations.

Currently, there are not sufficiently accurate models available to predict the filtered volume and outlet parameters for the sand filters used in micro-irrigation systems. The {{aim of this study}} was to obtain a predictive model able to perform an early detection of the filtered volume and sand filter outlet values of dissolved oxygen (DO) and turbidity, both related to emitter clogging risks. This study presents a novel hybrid algorithm, based on support vector machines (SVMs) in combination with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique, for predicting the main filtration operation parameters from data corresponding to 769 experimental filtration cycles in a sand filter operating with effluent. This optimization technique involves kernel parameter setting in the SVM training procedure, which significantly influences the regression accuracy. To this end, the most important physical-chemical parameters of this process are monitored and analyzed: effective sand media size, head loss across the filter and filter inlet values of dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, electrical conductivity (Ec), pH and water temperature. The results of the present study are two-fold. In the first place, the significance of each physical-chemical variables on the filtration is presented through the model. Secondly, a model for forecasting the filtered volume and sand filter outlet parameters is obtained with success.

The generated electrons are conveyed through external "bio-appendages" developed by the bacteria to transparent nano-pillars made of indium tin oxide (ITO), Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or other conducting materials, and then transferred to the cathode.

40|$|The Pearl River Estuary is a {{subtropical}} estuary and {{the second}} largest in China based on discharge volume from the Pearl River. Processes in the estuary vary spatially and temporally (wet vs dry season). In the dry season {{at the head of}} the estuary, hypoxic and nearly anoxic conditions occur and NH 4 reaches > 600 mu M, NO 3 is similar to 300 mu M and nitrite is similar to 60 mu M indicating that nitrification and denitrification may be important dry season processes in the region extending 40 km upstream of the Humen outlet. There are very few biological studies conducted in this upper section of the estuary in either the dry or wet seasons and hence there is a need for further research in this region of the river. In the wet season, the salinity wedge extends to the Hongqimen <b>outlet</b> and <b>oxygen</b> is low (35 - 80 % saturation). Nitrate is similar to 100 mu M, silicate similar to 140 mu M: and phosphate is relatively low at similar to 0. 5 mu M, yielding an N:P ratio up to similar to 200 : 1 in summer. Nutrients decrease in the lower estuary and primary productivity may become potentially P-limited. Eutrophication is not as severe as one would expect from the nutrient inputs from the Pearl River and from Hong Kong's sewage discharge. This estuary shows a remarkable capacity to cope with excessive nutrients. Physical processes such as river discharge, tidal flushing, turbulent dispersion, wind-induced mixing, and estuarine circulation play an important role in controlling the production and accumulation of algal blooms and the potential occurrence of hypoxia. Superimposed on the physical processes of the estuary are the chemical and biological processes involved in the production of the bloom. For example, the 100 N: 1 P ratio indicates that P potentially limits the amount of algal biomass (and potential biological oxygen demand) in summer. While extended periods of hypoxia are rare in Hong Kong waters, episodic events have been reported to occur during late summer due to factors such as low wind, high rainfall and river discharge which result in strong density stratification that significantly dampens vertical mixing processes. Nutrient loads are likely to change over the next several decades and monitoring programs are essential to detect the response of the ecosystem due to the future changes in nutrient loading and the ratio of nutrients.

Tidal volumes (VT) delivered by the Ventrain(®) were assessed by the ASL 5000 test lung (respiratory rate: 15 min(- 1), I:E = 1 : 1, compliance: 100 ml/cmH 2 O, resistance: 3. 06 cmH 2 O/l/s). RESULTS VT ranged from 82 to 483 ml for inspiration and 82 to 419 ml for expiration. Measured IP, flow, and VT were less dependent on the set gas flow rate but more on the source's DP. With rising DP the IP, the flow at the catheter tip and consequently VT increased. At an approximate target I:E ratio of 1 : 1, the ratio of inspiratory to expiratory VT increased with higher DP and gas flow rates. CONCLUSION The oxygen sources resulted in clinically different IP, flows, and VT delivered by the Ventrain(®) at given gas flow rates. This needs {{to be considered in}} a clinical emergency situation. Integrating an adjustable pressure valve into Ventrain(®) to allow regulation of the lowest necessary IP would make its use safer...|$|R
40|$|Chemical looping {{combustion}} {{has arisen}} as an attractive possible option for carbon capture and storage. With coal as our most abundant fuel type {{it is of}} great interest to include it in the process. Chemical looping combustion of solid fuels faces some difficulties, one being unconverted fuel, CO, CH 4 and H 2 leaving the reactor with the flue gas. A possible measure to increase the total efficiency is to oxidize the remaining fuel with pure oxygen in a post oxidation chamber. The aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of such a chamber and to provide recommendations regarding operating conditions. The project is based on gas reaction modelling in the software CHEMKIN where a thorough simulation setup is established. The importance of operating temperature and mixing of oxygen is analyzed and a sensitivity analysis investigating the importance of different process parameters on the performance is also conducted. In addition to combustion performance a limited study on the fate of NOx and SOx in the post oxidation chamber is also performed. The results from the simulations show that the POC should have a temperature above 800 °C and be designed to allow for good mixing with the added oxygen. The vast majority of the remaining fuel from the fuel reactor will be oxidized in the POC but complete oxidation is impossible at stoichiometric conditions.

40|$|The {{aeration}} cone is {{the main}} equipment of pure oxygen absorption system for the recently domestic used water recirculating culture system. The operational control of the aeration cone which controls the Dissolved Oxygen (DO) value of water <b>outlet</b> and the <b>oxygen</b> transfer rate, is mainly by changing the inlet water flowrate and the regulatory valve setting pressure of pure oxygen. In this study, the temperature of water was maintained at about 30 ℃. When the inlet water flowrate of the aeration cone was controlled between 270 - 330 L/min, the DO value of water outlet would demonstrate a decreasing tendency with the increasing of the inlet water flowrate. When the regulatory valve setting pressure was controlled between 0. 35 - 0. 40 kg/cm 2 (cm square), both of the DO value of water <b>outlet</b> and the <b>oxygen</b> transfer rate would increase as the regulatory valve setting pressure raised. The experimental {{results showed that the}} oxygen transfer rate was between 1. 137 - 1. 647 g/min, the oxygen absorption efficiency was maintained between 72. 4 - 81. 5 %, the oxygen transfer efficiency was between 0. 0681 - 0. 0941 kg/kW-hr, the aeration effectiveness was 60. 67 - 70. 87 %, and the utilization efficiency was maintained between 44. 2 - 58. 7 %. Furthermore, the relative height between positions of the culture tank and the aeration cone can be designed and planned using Bernoulli's equation. The water lever inside the aeration cone would drop as the regulatory valve setting pressure increased and raise as the inlet water flowrate increased. The water level inside the aeration cone must be kept at least over 60 cm to avoid the water level being too low as the undissolved oxygen inside the aeration cone smuggled with the water flow to the culture tank resulting a waste of oxygen leaking to the atmosphere. 目前國內循環水養殖系統中，其純氧吸收系統主要以氧氣錐為主，而氧氣錐在操作控制上，主要是改變其入水口流量與純氧調節閥設定壓力來控制其出水口溶氧量與氧氣傳輸速率。在本研究中，水溫維持在 30 ℃左右，氧氣錐入水口流量控制在 270 - 330 L/min之間時，其出水口溶氧量會隨入水口流量的增加而呈現下降之趨勢，而氧氣傳輸速率則會隨入水口流量之增加而增加。調節閥設定壓力控制在 0. 35 - 0. 40 kg/cm 2 (公斤/平方公分) 之間時，氧氣錐出水口溶氧量與其氧氣傳輸速率，均會隨著調節閥設定壓力之增加而增加。本試驗結果顯示，氧氣錐之氧氣傳輸速率在 1. 137 - 1. 647 g/min之間，氧氣吸收效率維持在 72. 4 - 81. 5 ﹪之間，氧氣傳輸效率在 0. 0681 - 0. 0941 kg/kW-hr之間，曝氣效率在 60. 67 - 70. 87 ﹪之間，氧氣利用效率則維持在 44. 2 - 58. 7 ﹪之間。 此外，養殖池與氧氣錐兩者之相對高度位置，可藉由柏努利方程式來加以設計規劃。其氧氣錐內水位離錐底之高度會隨著調節閥設定壓力之增加而下降，隨入水口流量之增加而提高，而氧氣錐內水位離錐底之高度至少須保持在 60 cm以上，以避免氧氣錐內水位過低，造成氧氣錐內未溶解之氧氣，夾帶在水流中，從養殖池洩出至大氣中，造成氧氣之浪費。目 錄 謝誌 [...] -I 摘要 [...] II ABSTRACT [...] III 目錄 [...] V 表目錄 [...] -VIII 圖目錄 [...] -XI 第一章 緒論 [...] 1 1 - 1 前言 [...] 1 1 - 2 研究目的 [...] 3 第二章 文獻探討 [...] 4 2 - 1 溶氧量對魚類之影響 [...] 4 2 - 2 水中溶氧之傳輸速率 [...] 6 2 - 3 氧氣錐純氧吸收系統 [...] 9 2 - 4 氧氣錐與養殖池兩者水位高度差之探討 [...] - 11 2 - 5 純氧吸收設備之相關參數 [...] 13 2 - 5 - 1 氧氣傳輸速率 [...] 13 2 - 5 - 2 氧氣傳輸效率 [...] 13 2 - 5 - 3 氧氣吸收效率 [...] 14 2 - 5 - 4 氧氣利用效率 [...] 15 2 - 5 - 5 曝氣效率 [...] 15 2 - 6 純氧吸收設備型式 [...] - 16 2 - 7 純氧之來源 [...] 20 第三章 實驗設備、材料與方法 [...] 21 3 - 1 試驗設備 [...] 21 3 - 1 - 1 循環水養殖系統組成 [...] - 21 3 - 1 - 2 純氧吸收系統 [...] - 22 3 - 1 - 3 試驗儀器 [...] - 23 3 - 2 試驗材料 [...] - 25 3 - 3 試驗設計 [...] - 26 第四章 結果與討論 [...] 30 4 - 1 氧氣錐內壓力之變化 [...] - 32 4 - 2 氧氣錐內氧氣及氮氣比例之變化 [...] - 35 4 - 3 氧氣錐出水口溶氧量之變化 [...] 40 4 - 3 - 1 氧氣錐運轉初期，其出水口溶氧量之變化 [...] - 40 4 - 3 - 2 調節閥設定壓力對氧氣錐出水口溶氧量之影響 [...] - 43 4 - 3 - 3 氧氣錐入水口流量對氧氣錐出水口溶氧量之影響 [...] 44 4 - 4 氧氣錐水位之變化 [...] - 46 4 - 5 養殖池水位高及其出水口流量之變化 [...] 51 4 - 5 - 1 氧氣錐入水口流量對養殖池水位高及其出水口流量之影響 [...] 51 4 - 5 - 2 調節閥設定壓力對養殖池水位高及其出水口流量之影響 [...] - 54 4 - 6 柏努利方程式 [...] - 56 4 - 6 - 1 氧氣錐與養殖池間之摩擦損失 [...] - 56 4 - 6 - 2 養殖池與氧氣錐內水位差預測值與實測值比較之結果 [...] - 58 4 - 7 氧氣錐性能參數 [...] 66 4 - 7 - 1 氧氣傳輸速率（OTR） [...] - 66 4 - 7 - 2 氧氧傳輸效率（TE） [...] 69 4 - 7 - 3 氧氣吸收效率（AE） [...] - 73 4 - 7 - 4 曝氣效率（E） [...] 75 4 - 7 - 5 氧氣利用效率（UE） [...] - 77 4 - 8 養殖池水中溶氧量之控制 [...] 79 4 - 9 養殖池中全時監測量測點溶氧量與平均溶氧量之差異 [...] 85 第五章 結論與建議 [...] - 93 第六章 參考文獻 [...] 97 附錄A [...] - 100 附錄B [...] - 10...|$|R
40|$|Elkem Materials is in {{the initial}} phase of {{developing}} rice husk combustion as a business strategy. By burning rice husk under controlled conditions the ash generated is amorphous silica in nature. This amorphous silica ash {{can be used as}} a substitute for micro silica in the concrete industry. Due to a growing demand for finely divided silica in the concrete industry, combustion of rice husk is an alternative method to generate this product. Elkem Materials and SN Power are considering to join forces in a power project based on rice husk. The idea is to install 20 MW power plants in designated Asian countries. The power will be generated from a steam cycle which heat exchanges with the rice husk combustion products. More insight is needed in order to understand how a general power plant based on rice husk can be put together. Today, two companies have developed different combustion technologies that can control the strict combustion conditions required. Still, more experimental data is needed to investigate under which conditions the reactors have to operate in order to meet the strict ash quality required by Elkem Materials. This thesis has carried out an evaluation of the major components in a 20 MW power plant facility based on rice husk. A central part has been to develop a model for how the energy content in rice husk can be utilized in a combustion process for further heat utilization. Another model is developed to estimate the surface area required to transfer a certain amount of heat from the combustion products. These models can be used for different rice husk samples and for different combustion conditions. All numbers calculated are guiding values. Lack of experiments and information has influenced their order of magnitude. Several assumptions and simplifications are carried out to be able to do some general estimations. The aim is to show the tendency, and more comprehensive calculations have to be done for further development of the project. The energy utilization of rice husk has been studied for four different combustion temperatures. In addition, five different samples of rice husk are analyzed in the combustion process to see how their characterizations influence the operation of the power plant. The results are also given an economical aspect. The greatest difference between each rice husk sample is the ash content. For the samples analyzed, this varies between 14 - 22 % (mass basis). The moisture content is low for all samples, about 9 %. Compared to other biomass fuels the carbon fraction is low and the oxygen fraction is high. This results in a low calorific value, between 12 - 14 MJ/kg. Lower ash content gives higher calorific value. Rice husk has a low bulk density, about 120 kg/m 3, and enormous volumes are necessary for generation of 20 MW electricity based on this fuel. The fuel feed varies between 480 - 580 ton/day, mainly depending on the calorific value. Different combustion temperatures have minor effect on the fuel feed. To generate a constant heat rate, a little increase in the fuel feed is necessary when the combustion temperature decreases. The ash product is a source for generating profit. Fuel with lower calorific value generates more ash. The fuel price is often decided by the calorific value, and in this case cheaper fuel will increase the profit. Between the two rice husk extremities analyzed, one sample generates 70 ton of ash per day, while the other 130 ton/day. A proximate and ultimate analysis of the different rice husk samples should be done prior to the decision of where to locate the power plant. The steam cycle is defined to operate with 55 bar and 530 °C into the turbine, while the outlet values are 0, 08 bar and 42 °C. This will generate about 21 MW. 1 MW is available for own internal demands, and 20 MW can be supplied to the local electricity grid. Operating under these conditions, the steam cycle requires 63, 25 MW of heat. Approximately 83 MW of thermal effect is needed to satisfy this need. Heat losses are not included. Depending on the size of the reactor, this amount requires several reactors in parallel where the generated flue gas is conveyed into a joint heat recovery steam generation system. The flue gas temperature has been taken down to 125 °C. The limited outlet temperature is decided by the amount of sulfur in the fuel, and by the SO 3 dew point temperature. To avoid degradation of the materials in lower temperature regions, the sulfur content and the corresponding dew point temperature have to be known. The most complex component in this power plant is the heat transfer unit. Because the flue gas heat transfer coefficient is low, large surface areas are needed to transfer the required amount of heat. In addition, since the majority of the ash is conveyed with the flue gas into the heat exchange units, several design restrictions have to be implemented in the boiler system. Extended surface area tubes (finned tubes) can not be used because of the impure flue gas. By installing smooth tubes, the required area will be enormous. Factors that have greater influence on the required surface area are the ash emissivity, the gas side fouling factor and the flue gas velocity. Heat transfer from radiation may contribute remarkably because of the high ash content in the flue gas. The flue gas velocity has to be strictly regulated because of the flue gas composition. This affects how efficient the heat transfer might be. Further investigations should focus on how to avoid too much reduction in the velocity. By implementing appropriate cleaning techniques, the velocity can probably be kept at higher levels. The fouling factor is the last critical parameter. This interacts with the velocity and can also be reduced by cleaning systems. Bullet cleaning is a suitable cleaning technique. When the combustion temperature decreases, the total surface area of the heat exchanger tubes will increase. Going from 850 °C to 770 °C the area increases about 1000 m 2. The areas calculated are instructive numbers. However, it is a clear relation between the combustion temperature and the required surface area. The evaluations are based on single units. Integration of the reactor and the boiler will probably increase the heat transfer efficiency and reduce the tube s surface area. To perfectly control the combustion temperatures, great amounts of oxygen are necessary. Seen from an energy utilization perspective, this is not a very efficient use of energy. A lot of air is used to reduce the temperature, and the flue gas energy content is low. Due to high excess of air in the flue gas, recycling the <b>outlet</b> <b>oxygen</b> is an important supplement for increasing the combustion efficiency. Depending on the rice husk sample and on the combustion temperature, the flue gas stream is approximately 80 kg/s. Secondary emission reduction measures are necessary to separate the fly ash from the flue gas stream. A recommended solution is to implement a cyclone to separate the larger particles (80 - 90 %) in combination with bag house filters that separate the smaller once. For these quantities of flue gas streams, the magnitude of the ash collectors have to be extraordinary large. Because the ash has an economical value, investment in this technology is important. An alternative separation method could be to locate a cyclone prior to the heat recovery system. This would simplify several challenges linked to the impure flue gas entering the water-tubes. Yet, commercialized solutions for this practice are not developed. From an economic perspective the project has great potential, though all numbers depend on future pricing, supply and demand. Realistic price estimates based on today s market justify investment in this type of power plant. The sold electricity will constitute 75 % of the income, while the amorphous silica ash constitutes the other 25 %. Though this project seems beneficial, the size of the plant should be reconsidered. Due to low bulk density, the power plant has to be located close to the rice husk suppliers. Calculations show that 53 trucks are necessary to supply the power plant. In general, the rice milling industry is characterized by smaller mills, and rice husk collected from several milling plants is necessary. A perfect industrial symbiosis would be to locate the plant on site with the mill. This presumes smaller power plants, operating with the amount of rice husk generated by the mill. Experience with controlled rice husk combustion and power generation is scarce. By operating smaller power plants, further experience will be gained. This will improve the possibility for successful design of larger power plants. </p...|$|R
