5|$|After {{recovering}} surprisingly fast {{from the}} sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. The First Samnite War from 343 BC to 341 BC was relatively short: the Romans defeated the Samnites in two battles, but {{were forced to}} withdraw before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> their Latin allies in the Latin War. Rome defeated the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius {{and again in the}} Battle of Trifanum, after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the stylistic}} {{innovations}} Radama adopted {{for the construction}} <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> the compound's buildings, the Rova largely retained its traditional features during his reign. The basic layout of the compound remained largely unaltered from its original design with the sole exception of {{an expansion of the}} Rova along its north-south axis. Stone walls topped with sharpened wooden stakes were built around the new perimeter during this period. Venerable buildings such as Besakana, Nanjakana, Mahitsy and Manjakamiadana were retained, as were the houses <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> Andrianampoinimerina's wives, many of whom were still living at the time of Radama's death in 1828. During his reign, Radama undertook the restoration of Marivolanitra to serve chiefly as housing for visiting foreigners, and briefly inhabited it himself in addition to his main residence at Besakana. He also had a house called Kelisoa ("Petite Beauty") built as a lodging for his concubines.|$|E

5|$|Laboratory {{studies have}} found that rice rats {{assimilate}} 88% to 95% of the energy in their food.

In an experiment, marsh rice rats did not show hoarding behavior, but wild rice rats have been observed carrying food to a nest. Even when they live in uplands, they mostly eat water plants and animals, although they consume some upland plants.|$|E
