40|$|Bi-layered {{materials}} are a reduced weight derivative of the sandwich structure and are comprised of one thin skin face reinforced by {{a thick layer}} of low density material. Bi-layered {{materials are}} characterized by high flexural stiffness and are a viable alternative to conventional sandwich materials in applications where the functional requirements can be met without the second face sheet of the sandwich. For structural applications bi-layered materials are required to have <b>oil</b> <b>canning</b> and buckling resistance. This work addresses the buckling of shallow bi-layered arches using numerical and analytical approaches. A numerical, finite element model is developed to simulate the buckling phenomenon and the results were compared with known experimental data. An analytical model was developed using the energy method analysis and the buckling load was predicted from the minimum energy criterion. Comparison of the numerical and analytical results yielded fairly good agreement. An imperfection analysis conducted by means of the numerical model indicated that the load carrying capacity of bi-layered structures is reduced by up to 40 % due to the presence of material and geometric imperfections. A parametric study conducted using the analytical model has been described to setup design guidelines for shallow bi-layered arches. It was found that the use of bi-layered structures can result in weight reduction of around 70 % when compared with equivalent single layered structure...|$|E
40|$|Fiber glass {{reinforced}} composites like sheet molding compounds (SMC) {{have recently been}} widely used in the fabrication of two-piece automobile hoods for passenger cars. In the present investigation, a one-piece composite hood with reinforcing ribs was optimally designed and manufactured by resin transfer molding {{in order to reduce}} manufacturing cost. In order to obtain the optimal design, stiffness analyses for deflections due to self-weight, <b>oil</b> <b>canning,</b> and torsion test conditions were carried out by applying the ABAQUWStandard program. Based on these analyses, the thickness dimension of the composite hood required to maintain a stiffness comparable to a conventional steel hood was determined. For optimization studies of the weight reduction of the currently proposed one-piece composite hood with reinforcing ribs, IDESIGN program was employed. Based on a recursive quadratic programming technique, the thickness dimensions of the reinforcing ribs were optimized. The deflection ratios between fiber {{glass reinforced}} composite and conventional steel hoods were minimized in the optimization studies. From the present studies, {{it was found that the}} weight saving effect obtained by introducing the optimally designed one-piece composite hood was 37 % compared to the conventional steel hood. This ranged approximately from 30 to 40 % for composite hoods manufactured by resin transfer molding, depending on the composite materials used. Through these studies, it was confirmed that the one-piece composite hood was a preferable design and manufacture, compared to currently used composite hood made in two pieces, in terms of weight reductions and manufacturing cost without losing the stiffness required...|$|E

50|$|However, {{properties}} of the coolant (water, oil, or air) also affect cooling. As example, comparing water and oil as coolants, one gram of <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> absorb about 55% of the heat for the same rise in temperature (called the specific heat capacity). Oil has about 90% the density of water, so a given volume of <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> absorb only about 50% of {{the energy of the}} same volume of water. The thermal conductivity of water is about 4 times that of <b>oil,</b> which <b>can</b> aid heat transfer. The viscosity of <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> be ten times greater than water, increasing the energy required to pump oil for cooling, and reducing the net power output of the engine.|$|R
