5|$|Jasper Schuringa, who was {{en route}} to Miami, Florida for a vacation, stopped Abdulmutallab from causing too much damage and {{received}} burn injuries in the process. In a statement, Schuringa, who was in seat 20J on the flight, said {{he was able to}} locate Abdulmutallab, help to extinguish the fire that the explosive had caused, and helped to restrain Abdulmutallab using plastic cuffs. Schuringa lives in Amsterdam, and was born in 1977 in Curaçao, Netherlands Antilles. Schuringa is a graduate of Leiden University, Leiden. He is a film director of low-budget Dutch films for an Amsterdam-based media company, and was the assistant director for National Lampoon's Teed <b>Off</b> <b>Too.</b>|$|E
5|$|Maibaum {{may have}} thought the {{eventual}} oil-rig finale a poor substitute, but it was originally intended {{to be much more}} spectacular. Armed frogmen would jump from the helicopters into the sea and attach limpet mines to the rig's legs (this explains why frogmen appear on the movie's poster). Blofeld would have escaped in his BathoSub and Bond would have pursued him, hanging from a weather balloon. The chase would have continued across a salt mine, with the two mortal enemies scrambling over white hills of salt before Blofeld would fall to his death in a salt granulator. Permission was not granted by the owners of the salt mine. It also made the sequence too long. Further problems followed when the explosives set up for the finale were set <b>off</b> <b>too</b> early; fortunately, a handful of cameras were ready and able to capture the footage.|$|E

But eventually West Indies were knocked out of contention when they were drubbed by Australia at Beausejour Cricket Ground in Saint Lucia. He had a forgettable match {{in front of his}} home crowd, but overall, Sammy had had a good series. He ended with 51 runs in four innings, the fourth highest aggregate for West Indies, and his 12.75 was the seventh best average.

25|$|At 19:30 Greenwich Mean Time as {{the convoy}} passed Dover, 45 Do17s from I. and II./KG 2 {{took off from}} Arras and {{attacked}} at 20:15, sinking one ship and damaging three more. The radar stations at Pevensey, Rye and Dover gave good warning of the attack and seven Spitfires from 64 Squadron were ordered up from RAF Kenley, with six more from 65 Squadron at RAF Hornchurch. The fighters took <b>off</b> <b>too</b> late, could not prevent the attack and 65 Squadron was bounced by 70 Bf109s from JG 27. Three Spitfires were shot down, all three pilots being killed and two Bf109s were claimed destroyed (although neither can be identified through Luftwaffe loss records). The fighters of 64 Squadron damaged a Do17 which crash-landed at Boulogne and another suffered light damage. Before dark, He111s bombed Portland Harbour near missing the steamer British Inventor, killing one man and hitting , whose crew lost four dead and three wounded. Dowding was now in {{no doubt that the}} Luftwaffe was concentrating on ships and harbours and that the seven coastal convoys and deep-sea convoys at sea would be attacked. Dowding regarded convoy escort as wasteful and feared that Fighter Command would be depleted before main battle. The Germans had lost seven reconnaissance aircraft in a week and the Jagdgeschwader were ordered to provide escorts.|$|E

500|$|Not {{everyone}} {{was satisfied with}} the Senate Ethics Committee conclusions.

[...] Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, called it a [...] "whitewash". Jonathan Alter of Newsweek said it was a classic case of the government trying to investigate itself, labeling the Senate Ethics Committee [...] "shameless" [...] for having [...] "let four of the infamous Keating Five off with a wrist tap." [...] The New York Times ran several editorials criticizing the Ethics Committee for having let the senators off lightly. Margaret Carlson of Time suspected the committee had timed its first report to coincide with the run-up to the Gulf War, minimizing its news impact.

500|$|On January 18, at 9:30 {{the lead}} {{elements}} from the 67th Army's 123rd Rifle Division and 2nd Shock Army's 372nd Rifle Division linked up near Workers Settlement No. 1, thus technically breaking the blockade and marking an important {{date in the}} Siege of Leningrad. German forces north of the settlement were cut off. Group Huhner, made up of two battle groups under the Lieutenant General Huhner, commander of the 61st Infantry Division, was supposed to hold the corridor between Workers Settlements Nos. 1 and 5 but was {{no longer able to}} do it. Later that day the Soviet forces captured Workers Settlement No. 5 after repelling a strong German counterattack. The lead elements from the 67th Army's 136th Rifle Division and 2nd Shock Army's 18th Rifle Division linked up {{to the north of the}} settlement at 11:45.

By early afternoon, the Soviet forces cleared Shlisselburg and Lipka from German forces and started liquidating the forces remaining in the forests south of Lake Ladoga.|$|E

500|$|On 30 January 1933, Hitler was {{appointed}} Reich Chancellor, his {{first step in}} gaining dictatorial control of Germany. Hess was named Deputy Führer of the NSDAP on 21 April and {{was appointed}} to the cabinet, with the post of Reich Minister without Portfolio, on 1 December. [...] With offices in the Brown House in Munich and another in Berlin, Hess was responsible for several departments, including foreign affairs, finance, health, education and law. All legislation passed through his office for approval, except that concerning the army, the police and foreign policy, and he wrote and co-signed many of Hitler's decrees. An organiser of the annual Nuremberg Rallies, he usually gave the opening speech and introduced Hitler. Hess also spoke over the radio and at rallies around the country, so frequently that the speeches were collected into book form in 1938. Hess acted as Hitler's delegate in negotiations with industrialists and members of the wealthier classes. As Hess had been born abroad, Hitler had him oversee the NSDAP groups such as the NSDAP/AO that were in charge of party members living in other countries. Hitler instructed Hess to review all court decisions that related to persons deemed enemies of the Party. He was authorised to increase the sentences of anyone he felt got <b>off</b> <b>too</b> lightly in these cases, and was also empowered to take [...] "merciless action" [...] if he saw fit to do so. This often entailed sending the person to a concentration camp or simply ordering the person killed. Hess was given the rank of Obergruppenführer in the Schutzstaffel (SS) in 1934, the second-highest SS rank.|$|E
500|$|The chapel was {{dedicated}} on 28 May 1621, and extended in 1636. The architectural historian Giles Worsley {{has described the}} chapel's east window (added in 1636) as an instance of Gothic Revival architecture, rather than Gothic Survival, since a choice was made to use an outdated style– classical architecture had become accepted as [...] "the only style {{in which it was}} respectable to build". Jonathan Edwards (principal from 1686 to 1712) is reported to have spent £1,000 (approximately £ in present-day terms) during his lifetime on the interior of the chapel, including the addition of a screen separating {{the main part of the}} chapel from the ante-chapel (at the west end) in 1693. In 1853, stained glass by George Hedgeland was added to the east window. In 1863, the architect George Edmund Street was appointed to renovate the chapel. The arch of the chancel was widened, the original Jacobean woodwork was removed (save for the screen donated by Edwards and the pulpit), new seats were installed, new paving was placed in the main part of the chapel and a stone reredos was added behind the altar. Views of the changes have differed. On 21 October 1864, Building News reported that the restoration was nearing completion and was of [...] "a very spirited character". It said that the new [...] "handsome" [...] arch showed the east window [...] "to great advantage", with [...] "other improvements" [...] including a [...] "handsome reredos". Ernest Hardy, principal from 1921 to 1925, said that the work was [...] "ill-considered", described the reredos as [...] "somewhat tawdry" [...] and said that the Jacobean woodwork had been sold <b>off</b> <b>too</b> cheaply. In contrast, the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner called the reredos [...] "heavily gorgeous".|$|E
