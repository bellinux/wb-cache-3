30|$|To test these {{possibilities}} we consider as outcome a dummy equal to 1 if individual i goes from employed to non-employed between year t and t+r. For each individual, the dummy {{is equal to}} 0 if individual i {{does not change the}} employment status or becomes employed. In particular, as the employment status of a person is measured in a specific month of the year, we are testing whether larger presence of immigrants increases the probability of a native individual to be unemployed during that particular week. Hence, the outcome y at the occupation-country-year level is the share of those workers employed at time t and not employed at time t+r. Non-employed persons are both unemployed, as well as workers employed for less than 15 hours, individuals doing housework, looking after children or other <b>persons</b> and <b>other</b> economically <b>inactive</b> <b>persons.</b> We exclude from the sample individuals in education or training, retired or in community or military service.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{effects and}} working mechanisms of low-intensity aerobic wheelchair exercise on fitness, (upper-body) health and active lifestyle in <b>inactive</b> <b>persons</b> with chronic {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI). Methods: A multicenter randomized-controlled trial (RCT) in 40 inactive manual wheelchair users (aged 28 - 65 y) with chronic paraplegia or tetraplegia (time since injury > 10 y). Subjects will be randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group. The intervention will consist of 16 weeks (2 times per week, 30 min per session) of low-intensity aerobic handrim wheelchair exercise (30 - 40 % HRR) on a treadmill. Repeated measurements will be performed before starting the intervention or entrance of the control group, and after week 8, 16 and 42 following the start. The primary outcome will be wheelchair-specific physical fitness. Secondary outcomes will be upper-body pain and discomfort, shoulder load, propulsion technique, wheelchair skill performance and physical activity levels. Conclusions: Results of this first RCT on low-intensity aerobic wheelchair exercise for <b>inactive</b> <b>persons</b> with chronic SCI can improve SCI-specific exercise guidelines and provide an evidence-base for an aftercare program aimed at preserving fitness, health and active lifestyle of persons aging with SCI. ...|$|R

Using data on 185, 412 men and women aged 51 – 72 years participating in the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study, the authors assessed all-cause mortality over 10 years (1996 – 2006).

This implies that, on average, the households from the invaded Kebeles have relatively more labour force than those households from the non-invaded Kebeles. However, the treatment group of households showed a slightly lower average dependency ratio (1.030) than households from the control group (1.056).

40|$|Background: Physical {{activity}} (PA) {{is considered}} a cornerstone of diabetes mellitus management to prevent complications, but conclusive evidence is lacking. Methods: This prospective cohort study and meta-analysis of existing studies investigated the association between PA and mortality in individuals with diabetes. In the EPIC study (European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition), a cohort was defined of 5859 individuals with diabetes at baseline. Associations of leisure-time and total PA and walking with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and total mortality were studied using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. Fixed-and random-effects meta-analyses of prospective studies published up to December 2010 were pooled with inverse variance weighting. Results: In the prospective analysis, total PA was associated with lower risk of CVD and total mortality. Compared with physically <b>inactive</b> <b>persons,</b> the lowest mortality risk was observed in moderately active persons: hazard ratios were 0. 62 (95 % CI, 0. 49 - 0. 78) for total mortality and 0. 51 (95 % CI, 0. 32 - 0. 81) for CVD mortality. Leisure-time PA was associated with lower total mortality risk, and walking was associated with lower CVD mortality risk. In the meta-analysis, the pooled random-effects hazard ratio from 5 studies for high vs low total PA and all-cause mortality was 0. 60 (95 % CI, 0. 49 - 0. 73). Conclusions: Higher levels of PA were associated with lower mortality risk in individuals with diabetes. Even those undertaking moderate amounts of activity were at appreciably lower risk for early death compared with <b>inactive</b> <b>persons.</b> These findings provide empirical evidence supporting the widely shared view that persons with diabetes should engage in regular PA...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{the health}} {{sciences}} have been observing {{the negative impact}} of mass unemployment on health for some time now, health reporting remains fragmentary. Methods: The 2005 microcensus was conducted as an official random sample survey. A total of 380, 000 households, comprising 820, 000 individuals, took part. Providing health information was optional, with a response ratio of about 85 %. The Scientific Use File contains a 70 % subsample of the data set. Results: As of the survey date, average annual illness rates for 2005 were 6. 5 % among unemployed and 26. 6 % among <b>inactive</b> <b>persons</b> seeking to work (not available). If unemployed and <b>inactive</b> <b>persons</b> seeking to work were pooled into the single group of "job seekers", their average annual illness rate was 8. 8 %. This was significantly higher than for employed individuals, whose rate was 4. 4 %. However, the age-standardised odds ratios decreased from 2. 2 to 1. 8 for female job seekers and from 2. 2 to 1. 6 for male job seekers after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, family type, household structure, education, vocational training, socioeconomic variables, disabilities, smoking status, and other factors. The children of job seekers who are the principal income earners were more than proportionally ill at the survey date, too. In multivariate model calculations, among persons who had been unemployed a year before, an illness lasting more than 12 months had the strongest impact on chances for present employment. Chances for reintegration were likewise substantially lower for persons with a disability. Conclusion: The microcensus analyses confirm the multifarious interactions between health and occupational status. Unemployment constitutes a present challenge for public health...|$|R
