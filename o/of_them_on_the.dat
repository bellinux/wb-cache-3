5|$|During {{the night}} of 26 September 1916, Bolton was the target for an aerial offensive. L21, a Zeppelin {{commanded}} by Oberleutnant Kurt Frankenburg of the Imperial German Navy, dropped twenty-one bombs on the town, five <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> working class area of Kirk Street, killing thirteen residents and destroying six houses. Further attacks followed on {{other parts of the}} town, including three incendaries dropped close to the Town Hall.|$|E
5|$|After the Simpsons {{arrive at}} home, the camera cuts {{to a shot}} <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> couch, then zooms out to show this as a picture {{hanging on the wall}} of a fictional {{overseas}} Asian animation and merchandise sweatshop. The animation color quickly becomes drab and gray, and the music turns dramatic à la Schindler's List. A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste, and a female artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the removal}} of the Beardmore Crane in the 1970s and the Fairfield Titan in 2007, there are now four giant {{cantilever}} cranes on the River Clyde. The others are at Stobcross (Finnieston Crane), Scotstoun (Barclay Curle Crane) and Greenock (James Watt Dock Crane). Fewer than sixty giant cantilever cranes were built worldwide, six <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Clyde, and as of May 2011, it is believed only eleven remained, four of those on the Clyde.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet's {{attack was}} delayed, however, because he {{first had to}} wait for his final brigade (Evander M. Law's, Hood's division) to arrive, and then he was forced to march on a long, {{circuitous}} route that could not be seen by Union Army Signal Corps observers on Little Round Top. It was 4 p.m. by the time his two divisions reached their jumping off points, and then he and his generals were astonished to find the III Corps planted directly in front <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Emmitsburg Road. Hood argued with Longstreet that this new situation demanded a change in tactics; he wanted to swing around, below and behind, Round Top and hit the Union Army in the rear. Longstreet, however, refused to consider such a modification to Lee's order.|$|E
5|$|Slavery was not {{abolished}} {{even after}} the Thirteenth Amendment. There were four million freedmen and most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same plantation, doing the same work that they did before emancipation, except as their work had been interrupted and changed by the upheaval of war. Moreover, they were getting about the same wages and apparently {{were going to be}} subject to slave codes modified only in name. There were among them thousands of fugitives in the camps of the soldiers or {{on the streets of the}} cities, homeless, sick, and impoverished. They had been freed practically with no land nor money, and, save in exceptional cases, without legal status, and without protection.|$|E

5|$|The Guise {{brothers}} {{set about}} persecuting the Protestants with zeal. Catherine adopted a moderate stance and spoke against the Guise persecutions, {{though she had}} no particular sympathy for the Huguenots, whose beliefs she never shared. The Protestants looked for leadership first to Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre, the First Prince of the Blood, and then, with more success, to his brother, Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé, who backed a plot to overthrow the Guises by force. When the Guises heard of the plot, they moved the court to the fortified Château of Amboise. The Duke of Guise launched an attack into the woods around the château. His troops surprised the rebels and killed many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot, including the commander, La Renaudie. Others they drowned in the river or strung up around the battlements while Catherine and the court watched.|$|E
5|$|The Rosetta Stone is a {{fragment}} of a larger stele. No additional fragments were found in later searches of the Rosetta site. Owing to its damaged state, {{none of the three}} texts is absolutely complete. The top register, composed of Egyptian hieroglyphs, suffered the most damage. Only the last 14 lines of the hieroglyphic text can be seen; all of them are broken on the right side, and 12 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left. The following register of demotic text has survived best; it has 32 lines, of which the first 14 are slightly damaged on the right side. The final register of Greek text contains 54 lines, of which the first 27 survive in full; the rest are increasingly fragmentary due to a diagonal break at the bottom right of the stone.|$|E
5|$|The police {{presence}} {{did not appear}} to help: between 2002 and 2006, arrests of juveniles on Metro increased from 156 to 295, and warnings increased 40 percent. Nearly half the arrests occurred at just five stations: Anacostia, Fort Totten, Gallery Place–Chinatown, L'Enfant Plaza, and Minnesota Avenue—four <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Green Line. Metro created a special unit to focus on juvenile crime on Metro, and established liaisons at all D.C. public schools to feed intelligence and information about pending problems to Metro's police division.|$|E

5|$|Just {{before the}} ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion {{landed on the}} battlefield, the Viet Cong had intercepted a radio {{conversation}} between the aforementioned unit and the 52nd Ranger Battalion in the district centre; several months earlier the 7th Airborne Battalion {{was involved in the}} battle at Bình Giã, so they vowed to avenge the loss of their comrades. Thus, from the soccer field, the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion marched up to Thuận Lợi, against only light opposition. The South Vietnamese paratroopers arrived at the area where the first group of the ARVN 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, was dropped off and they collected seven survivors and 55 bodies. In the afternoon, as elements of the 7th Airborne Battalion moved through the Thuận Lợi rubber plantation to search for remnants of the second group of the ARVN 1st Battalion, the Viet Cong 271st Regiment started attacking the South Vietnamese paratroopers in a manner which had characterised earlier ambushes. Taking advantage of the poor weather conditions that had limited U.S. air strikes, as well as their numerical superiority, the Viet Cong broke the South Vietnamese formation into small groups and destroyed many <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> next day, the strength of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion was reduced from 470 to just 159 soldiers.|$|E
