50|$|Safe {{sex is a}} {{relevant}} harm reduction philosophy, and condoms are used {{as a form of}} safe sex and contraception. Condoms are widely recommended for the prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). According to reports by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and World Health Organization (WHO), correct and consistent use of latex condoms reduces the risk of HIV/AIDS transmission by approximately 85-99% relative to risk when unprotected. The most effective way to avoid sexually transmitted infections is to abstain from sexual intercourse, especially vaginal, anal, and <b>oral</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse.</b>|$|E

Also, the offense is committed when a victim {{is a person}} younger than fourteen years, or {{a person with a}} volitional or cognitive impairment, {{even in the absence of}} physical or psychological violence. The penalty shall be imposed without prejudice to the penalties that may apply for the commission of other offenses.|$|E

40|$|A case of disseminated gonococcal {{infection}} {{in which the}} gonococcus was isolated from the blood and genitalia and the meningococcus from the throat is described. A second patient, in whom the meningococcus was isolated from the throat and the gonococcus from the genitals but in whom no organisms were recovered from the blood, had lesions resembling those of a disseminated infection. The results of 150 throat cultures from patients who were examined at a clinic {{because they had a}} history of <b>oral</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> are presented. The meningococcus was isolated nearly six times more often in patients with genital gonorrhoea than in those in whom genital cultures were negative, while the gonococcus was found 2 1 / 2 times more often in those who carried the meningococcus in the throat than in those who did not. If these findings can be confirmed it could indicate an individual susceptibility to the acquisition of Neisserian organisms that would merit further investigation...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{report a}} case of an {{inguinal}} bubo in a young man caused by an anaerobe, Prevotella bivia, which was acquired during <b>oral</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse.</b> As far as the authors know, {{this is the first}} reported case of a sexually transmitted infection by Prevotella. Prevotella spp. inhabit the oral cavity and are highly prevalent in bacterial vaginosis, a polymicrobial syndrome resulting from replacement of the normal vaginal Lactobacillus spp. flora by high concentrations of anaerobic microorganisms such as Prevotella spp., Mobiluncus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis and other uncultivated anaerobes. CASE REPORT A 34 -year-old man presented to our department with a 5 -day history of a painful mass in the left groin (figure 1). He had been treated with cipro-floxacin and doxycycline for 3 days without any improvement. His past medical record was unre-markable without any previous sexually trans-mitted infection (STI) or genital ulcer, but he reported unprotected sexual intercourse with a woman 48 h prior to the appearance of the symptoms. Physical examination revealed an erythematous, warm, tender and fluctuant mass, 532 cm in diameter, in the left inguinal area. This mass was extremely painful on palpation. No genital, anal or perianal ulcers were observed, and no associated urethral symptoms were present. A detailed exam of the penis and scrotum was also normal. Inguinal ultrasound studies showed a hypoechoic subcutaneous mass and ruled out testicular or epididimal abnormalities. An abdominalepelvic CT scan disclosed several enlarged lymph nodes at the left inguinal region (figure 2), one of them showing fistulisation to the subcutaneous tissue. No other abdominal masses were detected. Serological testing for syphilis (treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR)), HIV and Chlamydia tracho-matis was negative. Since antibiotic treatment had proven unsuccessful, incision and drainage were performed. The foul-smelling purulent exudate obtained was tested for C trachomatis by real tim...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the nature of hypersexuality and the personality factors associated with the desire for and experience of high frequency sexual behavior. Participants in the study were 69 male and 93 female university students. Respondents reported on their desire for and experience of masturbation, <b>oral</b> sex, <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse,</b> pornography, indecent phone calls or letters, prostitution, exhibitionism, voyeurism, as well as providing self-report measures which evaluated their levels of state and trait anxiety, depression, obsessive and compulsive symptoms and fear of intimacy. The results demonstrated that subjects who engaged in high-frequency voyeurism were more depressed than low-frequency voyeurs. Respondents in the high-frequency sexual deviant desire and behavior groups appeared to have more obsessive-compulsive symptoms in comparison to the low-frequency deviant sexual behavior and desire groups. Increased psychopathology was not associated with high-frequency non-deviant sexual behaviors and desires. This finding raised the question of whether labels such as sexual compulsion and addiction are merely pathologizing illegal sexual behavior...|$|R

40|$|Palmtop-assisted self-interviewing (PASI) {{may provide}} a cheaper and more mobile {{alternative}} to audio-computer–assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) for collecting sensitive behavioral data. To evaluate PASI, in late 2002 the authors enrolled 1, 283 Thai students aged 15 – 21 years in a randomized trial. Data collection used PASI, ACASI, self-administered questionnaire, and face-to-face interview in combination with drug-use urine testing. By use of reported levels of behaviors and agreement between self-reports of smoking and urine test results, PASI and ACASI (alpha 0. 05) were compared for noninferiority, and PASI and interview were compared for superiority (alpha 0. 05). Noninferiority of PASI was demonstrated by use of self-reports of the most sensitive areas of sexual behavior (e. g., <b>oral</b> sex, <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse,</b> commercial sex, history of genital ulcers, pregnancy), as well as self-reports of less sensitive behaviors (e. g., alcohol use, dietary behaviors, symptoms of depression). Data generally showed noninferiority of PASI, ACASI, and self-administered questionnaires when compared {{with each other and}} superiority ofPASI, ACASI, andself-administeredquestionnaireswhencomparedwith interviews. PASI agreements between self-reports of tobacco smoking and presence of nicotine metabolites in urine were noninferior to ACASI and superior to interviews.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective. Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that early age of first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify a set of risk behaviors and partner characteristics that mediate the association between age of first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> and subsequent HPV infection in adolescent and young adult women. Methods. Female university students completed surveys and underwent HPV testing every 6 months for up to 3 years. HPV-positive participants were matched to HPV-negative participants (252 pairs, total N � 504). Associations were examined between risk behaviors/partner characteristics and both age of first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> and HPV infection. Those variables associated with either age of first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> or HPV infection were entered into a generalized estimating equation (to account for the matched study design) modeling the association between age of first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> and HPV infection. Results. Mean age of first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> was 16. 7 (� 1. 8) years, and early age of first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> was associated significantly with HPV infection (� �� 0. 20; odds ratio: 0. 82; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 74 – 0. 90). The association was mediated by number of sexual partners in the past 6 months, history of sexually transmitted infection, alcohol and drug use related to sexual behaviors, and partner’s number of sexual partners. Conclusion. A set of behavioral risk factors and partner characteristics partially mediate the association between age of first <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> and subsequent HPV infection.
