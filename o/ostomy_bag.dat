40|$|AbstractZygomycosis {{refers to}} a group of {{uncommon}} and frequently fatal mycoses caused by fungi of the class Zygomycetes, the organisms of which are usually found in decaying organic matter. Disease can be transmitted by the inhalation of spores or by direct inoculation on disrupted skin or mucosa. For rare diseases such as zygomycosis, two or more cases occurring in a short time should be investigated as a probable epidemic. Twelve hospital outbreaks and two pseudoepidemics caused by Zygomycetes have been cited in the English literature. The first epidemic was recorded in 1977 and the last in 2008. Outbreaks {{have been reported in the}} USA, the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Cases have included cutaneous, disseminated, pulmonary and rhinocerebral disease. Species identified have included Rhizopus arrhizus, Rhizopus rhizopodiformis, Rhizopus microsporus, Rhizopus spp., Absidia corymbifera and Rhizomucor pusillius. Sources of infection have included Elastoplast adhesive bandage rolls, ventilation systems, wooden tongue depressors, karaya (plant-derived adhesive) <b>ostomy</b> <b>bags,</b> and water damage to a linen store and patient shower room. Patients have included cardiosurgery patients, renal transplant recipients, orthopaedic patients, adult leukaemia patients, intensive care unit neonates, immunocompromised haematology patients, and burn unit patients. Although zygomycosis outbreaks in the hospital environment are infrequent, a high index of suspicion should exist if necrotic lesions appear in proximity to a postoperative wound. Direct tissue examination and tissue culture and histopathology must be routinely performed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE:To {{investigate}} {{knowledge and}} fear of colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. METHODS:A 12 -item self-administered questionnaire, developed after a careful literature review, was administered to all consecutive IBD patients treated with infliximab who were followed up at Nancy University Hospital (Vandoeuvre-lès-Nancy, France) between February and May 2012. RESULTS:Altogether 100 patients including 72 with Crohn's disease (CD) were included. Only 7. 0 % of patients spontaneously mentioned CRC risk as a main feature of IBD and 37. 0 % as a potential IBD complication. CRC was the most feared complication by 26 patients [ulcerative colitis (UC) 46. 4 % vs CD[*] 18. 1 %, P < 0. 01]. Two-thirds of patients knew that IBD increases CRC risk (UC[*] 81. 9 % vs CD[*] 57. 1 %, P[*]=[*] 0. 02). Their main source of information was their gastroenterologist (52. 0 %). On the best screening method for CRC, 86. 0 % of the respondents mentioned colonoscopy. Only 32. 0 % of patients knew {{that it has to}} be performed 10 [*]years after diagnosis. In case of dysplasia, 51. 0 % of the patients would not undergo colectomy (CD 59. 7 % vs UC 28. 6 %, P < 0. 01), mainly due to the fear of having <b>ostomy</b> <b>bags.</b> Only one-quarter of UC patients were aware of the chemopreventive effect of 5 -aminosalicylates on CRC risk. CONCLUSIONS:Two-thirds of IBD patients are aware of the risk of CRC. UC patients have a better knowledge of this risk and are more afraid of this complication. Our results underscore the need for therapeutic education about CRC in IBD patients...|$|R

40|$|The overall aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the passive prophylatic effect of bovine milk immunoglobulin administered orally either as a bolus (once a day) or as continuously (three times a day) against diarrhoea caused by Escherichia coli K 88. As the piglets have gastrointestinal structural and physiological similarities to humans they were assumed to be an appropriate model for the study. The first part {{of the study was}} done to evaluate the quantity of undigested immunoglobulin G in the gastrointestinal tract of the piglet. This was conducted in two experiments. One was a pilot study and the other was to estimate the quantity of undigested immunoglobulin G in the gut. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the rate of movement and the quantities of digesta that can be collected in the gastrointestinal tract regions at varying time intervals. Ten piglets were randomly divided into five groups of two in each. One from each group was selected, fed with an experimental diet which contained blue colour glass beads and dye and slaughtered at either 1, 5, 9, 16 and 24 hrs after feeding. Digesta was collected from various regions of the gastrointestinal tract. Faeces were collected using <b>ostomy</b> <b>bags</b> from those slaughtered at 9, 16 and 24 hrs only. The dye movement and the glass beads recovered were monitored. The movement of the dye was observed up to the small intestine at 1 hr. the caecum at 5 hrs, the beginning of the colon at 9 hrs, the two third of the colon at 16 hrs, and in the faeces at 24 hrs. Most of the beads were found in the stomach between 1 and 5 hrs, spread throughout the small intestine at 9 hrs, in the caecum at 16 hrs and in the colon at 24 hrs. The results confirmed that a sufficient amount of digesta could be collected from the various regions over a 24 hr period. The data facilitated the planning of the immunoglobulin digestibility trial which is the second part of the experiment. To measure the IgG digestibility, the piglets were fed on a large dose of an experimental diet (10 % of their metabolic body weight kg 0. 75 contain 30 % immunoglobulin) and the digesta, faeces and blood were collected. On the slaughter day, a group of five animals were fed on an experimental diet and digesta and blood were collected 1, 5, 9, 16, and 24 hours after feeding. Faeces were collected from those killed at 16 and 24 hours. Blood was analysed for immunoglobulin G for all piglets. Digesta and faeces were analysed for chromium and immunoglobulin G. There was no evidence of the presence of immunoglobulin G in the blood and faeces. A larger quantity of immunoglobulin G was found in the stomach (p< 0. 001) with a less in the first and second third of the small intestine (p< 0. 05) 24 hours post-prandially. This demonstrated that immunoglobulin G could resist digestion in the gut. The second part of the study was conducted to compare the effect of feeding bovine immunoglobulin as a bolus versus continuous against Escherichia coli K 88 diarrhoea. Twenty-four piglets, four-week-old, were randomly allocated to three treatment groups, namely continuous (fed a diet containing 10 % immunoglobulins three times a day), control (fed an immunoglobulins free diet), and bolus (fed a 30 % immunoglobulins diet in the morning and control diet the other two feeds). On Day 9, 30 minutes before the morning feed, the piglets were inoculated with 1 x 109 cfu Escherichia coli by a syringe into their throat, and observed for nine days. On day 17, all piglets were fed on control diet (no Ig) to evaluate if Escherichia coli K 88 would have any effect on recolonisation and diarrhoea and observed for further three days. Finally they were all treated with antibiotics, Biosol M and Tylan 200. The observations include faecal culture, faecal consistency, the percent of free water content in the faeces, weight and feed intake. Faecal culture was done twice before inoculation, three times during treatment, and once after all were fed on control diet and once after the antibiotics treatment. The free liquid content in the faeces was highest in the control group (37. 5 %) and lower in the continuous immunoglobulin group (25. 0 %) and least in the bolus immunoglobulin group (17. 5 %). Bolus immunoglobulin feeding (11. 25 %) lessened the severity of diarrhoea (classified by consistency) compared with the control group (26. 2 %) and continuous group (25. 0 %). Hence bolus immunoglobulin feeding had a better effect in controlling water loss and the severity of diarrhoea. A higher dosage of immunoglobulin in bolus feeding may also have prevented bacterial shedding. From this study, it can be concluded that feeding immunoglobulin as a bolus could be used as a prophylactic treatment for diarrhoea...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: {{the changes}} caused by ostomy are not {{restricted}} to gastrointestinal physiology, but also affect self-esteem and body image, causing changes in family, professional, social and emotional life. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate {{the quality of life}} in ostomized patients. METHOD: a cross-sectional epidemiological study was carried out in individuals enrolled in the Valepara&# 237;bana Ostomy Association. We analyzed thirty individuals divided into two equal groups according to the time of the stoma: group I included individuals with up to two years and, group II, those who had been ostomized for more than two years. A form was applied to evaluate the quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF). RESULTS: the acceptance of physical appearance was observed in 100 % of the participants. The performance of daily activities was not limited by the use of the <b>ostomy</b> <b>bag</b> for either group and the mean occurrence of eventual negative feelings in all subjects was 40 to 60 %.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} chronic fatigue on disease-related worries in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the potential multicolinearity between subjective questionnaires. METHODS: Patients in remission or with mild-to-moderate disease activity completed the fatigue questionnaire (FQ), the rating form of IBD patient concerns (RFIPC), the Short-Form 36 (SF- 36), and IBD questionnaire (N-IBDQ). In addition, clinical and epidemiological data were obtained. RESULTS: In total, 140 patients were included; of which 92 were diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and 48 with Crohn&#x 2019;s disease. The mean age of patients with chronic fatigue was 44. 2 years (SD = 15. 8) and for non-fatigued patients was 44. 7 years (SD = 16. 0). Chronic fatigued patients had clinically significantly increased levels of disease-related worries, as measured by Cohen&#x 2019;s d effect size. Worries about having an <b>ostomy</b> <b>bag,</b> loss of bowel control, and energy levels were most prominent in both chronic fatigued and non-chronic fatigued IBD patients. Variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance indicated {{that there were no}} problematic multicolinearity among the FQ, RFIPC, SF- 36 and N-IBDQ responses (VIF 2). CONCLUSION: Chronic fatigue is associated with increased levels of disease-related worries and concerns in IBD. Increased levels of worries were also associated with impaired health-related quality of life...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) {{is useful}} for {{treating}} complex wounds because it promotes granulation. In the present report, a successful case of VAC used for an open abdominal wound with enterocutaneous fistulae after multiple intestinal perforations during chemotherapy is described. Presentation of case: A 73 -year-old man was admitted to our hospital with severe abdominal pain. He underwent surgical resection for ascending colon cancer 4 years ago and was administered chemotherapy with bevacizumab for recurrence. Physical examination and computed tomography revealed perforation of the intestine, and an emergency operation was performed. Following this procedure, other intestinal perforations occurred, resulting in an open abdominal wound at postoperative day (POD) 10. To isolate enteric contents and promote granulation, VAC {{was applied to the}} abdominal wound with enterocutaneous fistulae. Oral intake started at POD 21 and the wound size became smaller. Further, an <b>ostomy</b> <b>bag</b> was directly attached to the most oral perforation site. The patient recovered from life-threatening events without severe infection and was transferred to another hospital close to his home at POD 180. Discussion: Gastrointestinal perforation is known {{to be one of the}} fatal adverse events of bevacizumab. In this case four gastrointestinal perforations were observed. Isolation of enteric contents is important to heal the wound and VAC is an effective therapy for the management of open abdominal wounds even with enterocutaneous fistulae. Conclusion: Innovative VAC use for the management of open abdominal wounds can improve the nutritional status and overall wound healing of the patient...|$|E
40|$|International audience: OBJECTIVES:Although anti-tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) {{therapy is}} {{the treatment of}} choice for perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD), the efficacy and safety of anti-TNF therapy in enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) remains unclear. METHODS:Between January 2008 and December 2009, we retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of all CD patients with ECF (excluding perianal fistula) treated with anti-TNF therapy followed up in Groupe d'Etude Thérapeutique des Affections Inflammatoires du tube Digestif (GETAID) centers. ECF closure and tolerance of anti-TNF therapy were studied using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS:Forty-eight patients (twenty-six women; median age 34. 6 (interquartile range= 25. 0 - 45. 5) years) were included in this study. The median follow-up period was 3. 0 (2. 0 - 6. 6) years. The fistula was located in the small bowel (n= 38), duodenum (n= 1), and colon (n= 9). The fistula has been developed in ileocolonic anastomosis in 17 (35 %) cases. Sixteen patients (33 %) had complex fistulas with multiple tracts and eleven patients (23 %) had a high ECF output (if wearing an <b>ostomy</b> <b>bag).</b> Complete ECF closure was achieved in 16 (33 %) patients, of whom eight relapsed during the follow-up period. In multivariate analysis, complete ECF closure {{was associated with the}} absence of multiple ECF tracts and associated stenosis. An abdominal abscess developed in 15 (31 %) patients. ECF resection was needed in 26 (54 %) patients. One patient died after surgery owing to abdominal sepsis. CONCLUSIONS:In CD patients with ECF, anti-TNF therapy may be effective in up to one-third of patients, especially in the absence of stenosis and complex fistula. A careful selection of patients is mandatory to prevent treatment failure and improves the safety. Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 5 August 2014; doi: 10. 1038 /ajg. 2014. 183...|$|E
40|$|Crohn’s disease {{cannot be}} healed but just taken into remission. Intestinal {{obstruction}} and fistulization, lack {{of response to}} medical management and perianal disease are the most frequent indication for intestinal surgery. Why is it necessary to measure quality of life after surgery for Crohn’s disease? Firstly, morbidity and mortality provide a partial and, very often, incomplete picture of outcome. Secondarily, nowadays, indications for surgery for Crohn’s disease are broader and not limited to life saving procedures {{but in many cases}} they include chronic conditions such as failure of medical therapy, or poor quality of life on it self. Finally, quality of life is a more patient orientated measure of outcome that can give the patients’ point of view about the procedure that is proposed. HRQL is a multi-dimensional concept which includes several dimensions based on biological and symptom variables. Disease-related worries and concerns about the disease on itself and its therapy reflect one of these dimensions and they are considered to be a major determinant of HRQL in patients with IBD. In fact, concerns about having surgery and having an <b>ostomy</b> <b>bag</b> have a relevant impact on HRQL of Crohn’s disease patients and having surgery increases concerns about body stigma. The early impact of surgery on HRQL is {{an important component of the}} patient’s decision regarding immediate and future surgery and understanding his or her recovery. Obviously, HRQL is expected to improve after operative procedures. In effect, in most of the studies, a significant improvement in HRQL early in the postoperative period was observed. Improvement, apparently, occurred irrespective of the disease activity measured with CDAI, the indication for surgery, type of procedure (abdominal or perineal), and history of previous surgery. On the contrary, the long-term impact of surgery on HRQL is more controversial. Some studies, mainly those performed with generic questionnaires, reported an improved HRQL while other (those performed with disease specific instruments) described a decreased HRQL. According to these authors, HRQL, apparently, depends mainly on the long-term disease activity...|$|E
