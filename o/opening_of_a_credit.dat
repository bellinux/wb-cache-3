40|$|A {{consumer}} finance company, as <b>a</b> part <b>of</b> {{its marketing}} efforts, wants {{to develop an}} effective customer-scoring model to predict potential cross-sell opportunities of home loans to existing credit card customers. Due to very low overlap between the two customer bases, this was {{proving to be a}} challenge. The objective of the PAKDD 2007 Data Mining competition was to build a modeling solution for the cross-sell problem. A modeling dataset with 40, 700 customers with 40 modeling variables and a target flag (set to 1 if a customer took up a home loan product with the Company within 12 months <b>of</b> <b>opening</b> <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> card account). In the modeling dataset, 700 customers had <b>a</b> target flag <b>of</b> 1 (Defined as an event rate 1 of 1. 72 %). The model performance evaluation criteria had been decided as the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUC) by the organizers to be calculated on <b>a</b> Prediction dataset <b>of</b> 8, 000 records. The solution presented here was built and executed on a SAS 9 platform with various non-parametric modeling tools for improving model performance. 2.
