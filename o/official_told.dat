5|$|An {{intelligence}} <b>official</b> <b>told</b> Seymour Hersh in 2015 that no fire-fight took place. In {{the earlier}} versions, Al-Kuwaiti {{is said to}} have opened fire on the first team of SEALs with an AK-47 from behind the guesthouse door, lightly injuring a SEAL with bullet fragments. A short firefight took place between al-Kuwaiti and the SEALs, in which al-Kuwaiti was killed. His wife Mariam was allegedly shot and wounded in the right shoulder. The courier's male relative Abrar was then said to have been shot and killed by the SEALs' second team {{on the first floor of}} the main house as shots had already been fired and the SEALs thought that he was armed with a loaded AK-47 (this was later confirmed to be true in the official report). A woman near him, later identified as Abrar's wife Bushra, was in this version also shot and killed. Bin Laden's young adult son {{is said to have}} encountered the SEALs on the staircase of the main house, and to have been shot and killed by the second team. An unnamed U.S. senior defense official stated that only one of the five people killed, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, was armed. The interior of the house was pitch dark, because CIA operatives had cut the power to the neighborhood. However, the SEALs wore night vision goggles.|$|E

U.S. Homeland Security Advisor and chief counterterrorism advisor to the president Lisa Monaco announced the study, and said foreign intrusion into a U.S. election was unprecedented and would necessitate investigation by subsequent administrations. The intelligence analysis would cover malicious cyberwarfare occurring between the 2008 and 2016 elections. CNN reported that an unnamed senior administration <b>official</b> <b>told</b> them that the White House was confident Russia interfered in the election.

500|$|Health {{effects from}} the smog were downplayed in most early reports. Some {{hospitals}} reported increased admissions of patients with asthma. An official at the city Department of Health noted that some hospitals were receiving fewer asthma patients, and attributed the reported increases to ordinary random fluctuations.

U.S. Ambassador John Bolton later revealed his instructions from Condoleezza Rice: [...] "We don't want a strong Secretary-General." [...] Tharoor was a protégé of the independently-minded Kofi Annan, and a senior American <b>official</b> <b>told</b> Tharoor that the US was determined to have [...] "No more Kofis."

500|$|Accompanied by Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams and 16 policemen, Shippard {{arrived in}} mid-October 1888. The king {{suspended}} concession negotiations {{in favour of}} meetings with him.

Meanwhile, Rhodes sent a number of letters to Rudd, warning him that Maund was his main rival, and that because the London syndicate's goals overlapped so closely with their own, it was essential that Cawston and Gifford be defeated or else brought into the Rhodes camp. Regarding Lobengula, Rhodes advised Rudd to make the king think that the concession would work for him. [...] "Offer a steamboat on the Zambezi same as [...] Stanley put on the Upper Congo... Stick to Home Rule and Matabeleland for the Matabele I am sure it is the ticket." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{minutes of}} the film showed Palestinians playing at war for the cameras, they wrote, falling down as if wounded, then getting up and walking away.

Christine Delavennat, France 2's communications director, said {{that none of the}} scenes in the footage had been staged. Jeambar and Leconte concluded that the shots had come from the Palestinian positions, given the trajectory of the bullets. Leconte said in an interview: [...] "If they had been Israeli bullets, they would be very strange bullets because they would have needed to go around the corner." [...] He dismissed France2's explanation—that perhaps the bullets that hit the boy had ricocheted off the ground. [...] "It could happen once, but that there should be eight or nine of them, which go around a corner? They're just saying anything." ...|$|E
500|$|Witnesses {{maintained}} that {{immediately after the}} bomb blast there was an exchange of gunshots between police and demonstrators. Accounts vary widely as to who fired first and whether any of the crowd fired at the police. Historian Paul Avrich maintains that the police fired on the fleeing demonstrators, reloaded and then fired again, killing four and wounding as many as 70 people. What is not disputed is that {{in less than five}} minutes the square was empty except for the casualties. According to the May 4 New York Times demonstrators began firing at the police, who then returned fire. In his report on the incident, Inspector Bonfield wrote that he [...] "gave the order to cease firing, fearing that some of our men, in the darkness might fire into each other". An anonymous police <b>official</b> <b>told</b> the Chicago Tribune, [...] "A very large number of the police were wounded by each other's revolvers. ... It was every man for himself, and while some got two or three squares away, the rest emptied their revolvers, mainly into each other." ...|$|E

500|$|Secret Service {{and other}} {{authorities}} {{said they were}} treating the plot very seriously, but acknowledged it {{did not appear to}} have moved to an advanced stage. Authorities said there {{did not appear to be}} any formal assassination plan and said they were unable to immediately assess how capable the men were of carrying out the attack. Federal authorities told the Associated Press they did not believe Schlesselman and Cowart had the means to carry out their threat. Barack Obama did not have any campaign appearances planned for Tennessee. One federal law enforcement <b>official</b> <b>told</b> the AP that [...] plans did not include Obama's schedule or a specific time and place for the assassination because, [...] "I don't think they had that level of detail." [...] Authorities said they made several mistakes during their planning, including drawing too much attention to themselves with their car markings. Authorities also felt their inability to carry out a home robbery together indicated they would be unable to carry out a sophisticated assassination plot. When asked whether the alleged threats were real, Daniel Cowart's lawyer, Joe H. Byrd, told reporters, [...] "White top hats and tuxedos? You tell me." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{example of}} this {{responsibility}} system was shown in the handling of protesters traveling to Beijing {{in the early years}} of the persecution. After the persecution of Falun Gong began in 1999, hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners traveled daily to Tiananmen Square or to petitioning offices in Beijing to appeal for their rights. [...] In order to stem the flow of protesters in the capital, the central 610 Office held local authorities responsible for ensuring that no one from their region went to Beijing. [...] "The provincial government fined mayors and heads of counties for each Falun Gong practitioner from their district who went to Beijing," [...] wrote Johnson. The mayors and county leaders then fined the heads of their local 610 offices or PLAC branches, who in turn fined the village chiefs, who fined the police. The police administered punishment to the Falun Gong practitioners, and regularly demanded money from them to recoup the costs. Johnson wrote that [...] "The fines were illegal; no law or regulation has ever been issued in writing that lists them." [...] Government officials announced them only orally in meetings. [...] "There was never to be anything in writing because they didn't want it made public," [...] one <b>official</b> <b>told</b> Johnson.|$|E
