But the type of diver-sification activity encouraged, {{as well as their}} scale, appears to be very different across the EU. Therefore the analysis of spatial diversification of <b>other</b> <b>gainful</b> <b>activity</b> of farm households in EU countries is the main purpose of this paper. 27 UE coun-tries described with 9 variables relating to the non-agricultural activity of farms are the analysed objects. The carried survey helps to show spatial disparities and to discriminate groups of countries with a similar farmers non-agricultural activity. There were used chosen methods of multidimensional comparative analysis which enable clustering the multicriterial objects: Czekanowskis diagram, Wards method, and k-mean algorithm. As a final result there were formed 5 clusters with countries about similar level of farm diversification. It may be stated, that a development of diversifica-tion of agricultural holdings is correlated with a spatial arrangement. Neighbouring countries belong to the same clusters of <b>other</b> <b>gainful</b> <b>activity</b> kinds.

The first purpose of this thesis is to analyse the non-competition clause in the Labour Code, {{which is the only}} means of contractual {{restriction of}} performance of <b>other</b> <b>gainful</b> <b>activity</b> of an employee. I also focus on identification of eventual problems that might occur when applying this legislation. The second purpose of this thesis is to compare selected questions concerning the non-competition clause in Czech and German law. The third purpose of this thesis is to present suggestions de lege ferenda and to propose amendments to the Labour Code. The thesis is divided into five main chapters. The first chapter is followed by the second chapter, which is subdivided into four subchapters. The first subchapter deals with the restriction of <b>other</b> <b>gainful</b> <b>activity</b> of an employee identical with the scope of business of the employer for the duration of employment.

40|$|A hepatite B se caracteriza como problema de saúde pública no âmbito mundial. Profissionais de saúde e de segurança pública, como os Policiais Rodoviários Federais, são uns dos grupos de maior risco para a infecção, uma vez que o contato direto com sangue e fluidos corporais são formas de transmissão da mesma. Estudos com a população em questão se mostram escassos no país e no estado de Mato Grosso do Sul, ainda que as características de seu trabalho a torne mais suscetível à infecção. Este estudo de corte {{transversal}} com abordagem quantitativa teve por objetivo caracterizar a infecção pelo vírus da hepatite B e a imunidade vacinal em Policiais Rodoviários Federais do município de Campo Grande - MS e foi realizado no ano de 2015 com 118 policiais lotados na Superintendência e na 1 º Delegacia da Polícia Rodoviária Federal do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul, por meio de entrevista estruturada e coleta sanguínea, com posterior realização de testes sorológicos em laboratório. Para a análise estatística, foram utilizados os testes Qui-quadrado, Qui-quadrado de tendência e Teste Exato de Fisher, e calculadas as razões de prevalência, com intervalo de confiança de 95 %. Para estimar as razões de prevalência ajustadas foi utilizada a Regressão de Cox (com tempo igual a uma unidade), utilizando as variáveis com significância ≤ que 20 %. A faixa etária predominante foi de 36 a 45 anos (46, 6 %), 83, 9 % eram do sexo masculino e 89 % possuía ensino superior. A prevalência global da infecção pelo HBV foi de 7, 6 % (2, 8 % a 12, 4 % IC 95 %). Não foi encontrada positividade para o HBsAg. A presença do marcador anti-HBc total isolado foi encontrada em 0, 8 % (0, 3 % a 1, 4 % IC 95 %) e o anti-HBc total associado ao anti-HBs em 6, 8 % (2, 2 % a 11, 3 % IC 95 %). Observou-se que 46, 6 % (37, 6 % a 55, 6 % IC 95 %) apresentou anti-HBs isolado, indicando imunidade vacinal e a taxa de indivíduos suscetíveis foi de 45, 8 % (36, 8 % a 54, 8 %). Acidentes de trabalho com material biológico se mostraram presentes em 24, 6 % dos casos, sendo que o tabagismo e a realização de outra atividade remunerada apresentaram associação estatística significativa em relação à ocorrência dos mesmos. Os resultados mostraram taxa de infecção pelo HBV nos policiais semelhante à população em geral, contudo os mesmos se encontram em risco constante de adquirir a infecção devido à exposição ocupacional, principalmente pela não utilização de EPI. Baixa taxa de vacinação contra a hepatite B e elevado índice de suscetibilidade também foram encontrados. Evidencia-se assim, a necessidade de estratégias mais eficazes de promoção e prevenção e de adequado fluxo pós-exposição ocupacional. ABSTRACT - Hepatitis B {{is characterized}} {{as a public health}} problem worldwide. Health workers and public security, as the Federal Highway Police, are one of the highest risk groups for infection, since the direct contact with blood and body fluids are its forms of transmission. Studies arround the population in question are scarce in the country and in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, although the characteristics of their work makes they to be more susceptible to infection. This study of cross-sectional cohort with a quantitative approach aimed to characterize the infection by hepatitis B virus and the vaccinal immunity in Federal Highway Officers of Campo Grande - MS and was conducted in 2015 with 118 police officers of the Superintendency and at the 1 st Federal Highway Police Station of the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, through structured interviews and blood collection, with subsequent serological tests in the laboratory. For statistical analysis, were used chi-square tests, chi-square of trend and Fisher's Exact test, and was calculated prevalence ratios with 95 % confidence interval. To estimate the reasons adjusted prevalence was used Cox Regression (with period equal to one unit) using the significance variables ≤ 20 %. The predominant age group was 36 - 45 years (46. 6 %), 83. 9 % were male and 89 % had higher education. The overall prevalence of HBV infection was 7. 6 % (2. 8 % to 12. 4 %; CI 95 %). Was not founded positive for HBsAg. The presence of anti-HBc isolated marker was found in 0. 8 % (0. 3 % to 1. 4 % CI 95 %) and the anti-HBc associated with the Anti-HBs in 6. 8 % (2. 2 % to 11. 3 % CI 95 %). It was observed that 46. 6 % (37. 6 % to 55. 6 % CI 95 %) showed a isolate anti-HBs, indicating vaccinal immunity and the rate of susceptible individuals was 45. 8 % (36. 8 % to 54, 8 %). Work accidents with biological material was showed present in 24. 6 % of the cases, and still, the cigarette smoking and performing <b>other</b> <b>gainful</b> <b>activity</b> showed statistically significant association in relation to the occurrence thereof. The results showed rates of HBV infection in police officers similar to the general population, however they were at constant risk of acquiring infection due to occupational exposure, mainly by not using IPE. Low rate of vaccination against hepatitis B and high susceptibility index were also found. It is evident therefore, the need for more effective strategies of promotion and prevention and adequade post-exposure flow...|$|E
50|$|The Sha’atang {{epitomizes the}} Mbaw-Yakum people {{because it is}} a period of communion and reunion. Before the coming of the Christmas, villagers knew that they had to buy new dresses for their {{children}} during Sha’atang. Before the reign of Fon Ghogomu, death celebrations of late Fons were frequent often provoked by problems that threatened the welfare and health of the Fondom. In such situations, the gods of the land were always consulted. A common answer was that one of the late Fons was angry that the villagers have neglected him for long. An eleven days of ceremonies (to usher peace) was then observed and the celebration carried out. If after this a similar revelation was made of another Fon, another death celebration was carried out immediately, so that a lot of time for farming and <b>other</b> <b>gainful</b> <b>activities</b> were lost this way. Because of this Fon Ghogomu suggested to the Kwifon that the celebration of all late Fons could be jointly done, once a year. i.e an Annual Cultural Festival. This period is a week of peace (retreat) when there should be no quarreling, fighting, shouting and farming. The rest of the period could therefore be used for farming and <b>other</b> <b>gainful</b> <b>activities</b> since this is done once a year.|$|R

40|$|Given the {{increased}} attention to risk {{management in the}} European Union’s (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), {{it is important to}} monitor and evaluate the rates of adoption by farmers and their determinants over time. Current European agricultural statistics (Farm Accountancy Data Network) capture few indicators that assess such strategies, but complementing data collected during the EU Framework 7 project FLINT have allowed the adoption of risk management strategies and the determinants of farmers’ preference for complementary or substitute instruments to be assessed. Adoption rates of risk management instruments such as insurance contracts, price contracts, off-farm income, other types risk of reduction measures and <b>other</b> <b>gainful</b> <b>activities</b> vary signifi cantly across EU Member States and farming types. Econometric analysis indicates that larger farms more often adopt crop insurance, occupational accident insurance, price contracts and diversifi cation but are less likely to adopt credit avoidance and off-farm employment (at a signifi cance level of 1 per cent). For policy analyses these indicators are a step forward for the determination of the net impacts and establishment of counterfactuals in the long term (i. e. time series encompassing also adverse years) for measuring the impact of the CAP at farm level...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} it is {{examined}} whether rural {{regions in the}} EU with a relatively high (low) employment growth in the 1980 s and early 1990 s have some common socio-economic characterics, which {{can contribute to the}} explanation of their employment performance. We have grouped the socio-economic characterics around the headings "local resources", "economic activities" and "supply of labour". We base our analysis on 465 regions in the EU 15, which we have divided into three groups: most rural regions, intermediate regions and most urban regions. Within each of these groups we have made a further distinction into leading (i. e. high non-agricultural employment growth) and lagging (i. e. low non-agricultural employment growth) regions. The analysis shows that leading rural regions have both growth of industrial employment and services employment and show a population growth as well, whereas in lagging rural regions population growth stagnates. Besides, leading rural regions tend to have a lower unemployment rate than lagging regions and tend to have a higher infrastructure endowment (highways, railways and waterways). On the other hand for quite a number of socio-economic indicators hardly any differences have been found between leading and lagging rural regions, like participation rates, education level of the population, average firm size, share of female employed in total employment and the share of farm holders with <b>other</b> <b>gainful</b> <b>activities...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{set out to}} {{investigate}} land fragmentation in Ute Districts of Vandeikya Local Government Area of Benue State in Nigeria {{with a view to}} gaining insight into its nature, extent and effect on the socio-economy of the area. To achieve this objective, 129 farm plots together with their owners were randomly selected and studied. Dimensions of individual plots and distances between plots and owners’ residences were determined through field measurements. A questionnaire survey was also conducted to obtain information on number of plots held per farming household in the area. In addition, aerial photographs taken over the area in 1977 and topographical maps of the area as well as reports were studied to get baseline data on the extent of fragmentation in the past. Analysis of data showed that, average size of farm plot in 1977 was 0. 171 hectare, and declined to 0. 149 hectare in 2009. Mean number of plots per farmer in 2009 was 5. 37 and mean number of plots cultivated in the same year was 3. 68, while range of plot holdings was between 2. 67 and 10. 00. Using Januszewski’s index of fragmentation, a value of 0. 173 was derived, indicating extreme pulverization of farm plots in the area. It was also found that farm plots were not only small, but also scattered over space. The study noted the diseconomies of land fragmentation arising from its severe limitation on mechanization and input investment in farm enterprise. It however recommends support for fragmentation in the area as a realistic response to ecological and demographic imperatives and as a way of stabilizing the socio-economy. It also recommends diversification from agriculture to <b>other</b> <b>gainful</b> <b>activities</b> in the area to augment proceeds from the small and inappropriately distributed farm plots. ...|$|R
