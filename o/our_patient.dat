40|$|The normal aorta {{has three}} {{branches}} from its arch, but variations in this pattern are not uncommon.

There was close correlation between the documented values and <b>our</b> <b>patients</b> except for the aberrant right subclavian artery which was {{more than three times}} more common in <b>our</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Progressive myoclonic {{epilepsy}} type {{one is a}} neurodegenerative disorder {{characterized by}} action- and stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, tonic–clonic seizures, progressive cerebellar ataxia, preserved cognition, and poor outcome. The authors report clinical, neurophysiological, radiological, and genetic findings of an Emirati family with five affected siblings and review the literature. Methods: All data concerning familial and clinical history, neurologic examination, laboratory tests, electroencephalogram, brain imaging, and DNA analysis were examined. Results: Genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of autosomal recessive progressive myoclonic epilepsy type 1 (EPM 1) in two males and three females. The median age at onset was three years. Action- or stimulus-sensitive myoclonus and generalized seizures were recorded in 100 % of <b>our</b> <b>patients,</b> at median age at onset of 3 and 4  years, respectively. Multisegmental myoclonus and generalized status myoclonicus were observed in 80 % of <b>our</b> <b>patients.</b> Dysarthria and ataxia developed in 100 % of <b>our</b> <b>patients.</b> Vitamin D deficiency and recurrent viral infections were noticed in 100 % of our cohort. Cognitive, learning, and motor dysfunctions were involved in 100 % of <b>our</b> <b>patients.</b> The sphincters were affected in 60 % of <b>our</b> <b>patients.</b> Abnormal EEG was recorded in 100 % of our cohort. Generalized brain atrophy progressively occurred in 60 % of <b>our</b> <b>patients.</b> Phenytoin and carbamazepine were used in 60 % of <b>our</b> <b>patients</b> with worsening effect. Valproate and levetiracetam were used in 100 % of <b>our</b> <b>patients</b> with improving effect. Conclusions: This {{is the first to}} report a family with EPM 1 in UAE. Our study emphasized a particular phenotype expressed as earlier disease onset, severe myoclonus, and generalized seizures. Cognitive, cerebellar, motor, and autonomic dysfunctions and brain atrophy were also earlier at onset and more severe than previously reported. Recurrent viral infections are another unique feature. This constellation in tout à fait was not previously reported in the literature...|$|R

40|$|Background and purpose: Guillain-Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is an infrequent, {{but potentially}} life-threatening disease with possible dysautonomic features and respiratory failure as potential complications. There {{are only a}} few previous studies on GBS in Norway. For this reason we did a thirteen year retrospective study including all patients treated for GBS in the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU), with focus on presence of antecedent infection, presenting clinical features symptoms, diagnostic tools, treatment and complications. Methods: This study included all patients with GBS admitted to the MICU at Oslo University Hospital, Ulleval, from the beginning of 2000 until the end of 2013. Results: A total of 32 patients were included. Antecedent infection was detected in over half of <b>our</b> <b>patients,</b> with upper airway infection being the most common. The most frequently presenting symptom in <b>our</b> <b>patients</b> was progressive muscle weakness, typically in a symmetrical, distal to proximal fashion. Over half of <b>our</b> <b>patients</b> had mild sensory disturbances. Signs of dysautonomia were present in over half of <b>our</b> <b>patients.</b> Spinal protein was ultimately found to be increased in 91 % of <b>our</b> <b>patients</b> after recurrent lumbar punctions. Respiratory failure occurred in 41 % of <b>our</b> <b>patients.</b> Complications (especially pneumonia) were almost twice as common in the patient group requiring mechanical ventilation. All patients received treatment with either plasmapheresis or immunoglobulins intravenously (IVIg), sometimes both. IVIg seemed to be first choice in most cases. Conclusions: The primary reason for MICU admission was observation. Almost half of <b>our</b> <b>patients</b> required mechanical ventilation (MV). The most frequent complication in the MICU was pneumonia, which was strongly associated with MV...|$|R
