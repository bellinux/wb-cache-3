5|$|The {{issue of}} the radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> is a {{challenging}} problem of the modern theoretical physics. The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> is incompatible to the premises {{of the theory of}} relativity. On the other hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the self-energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> tending to infinity.|$|E

50|$|When {{electrons}} are accelerated, as {{occurs when}} an AC electrical field is impressed on an antenna, they will radiate electromagnetic waves. These waves carry energy that {{is taken from}} <b>the</b> <b>electrons.</b> <b>The</b> loss <b>of</b> energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> appears as an effective resistance to <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrons,</b> analogous to <b>the</b> ohmic resistance caused by scattering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> in <b>the</b> crystal lattice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metallic conductor.|$|R

5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} theory {{increased}} {{through the end of}} the 1940s. Improvements in microwave technology made it possible to take more precise measurements of the shift of the levels of a hydrogen atom, now known as the Lamb shift and magnetic moment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron.</b> These experiments exposed discrepancies which the theory was unable to explain.|$|E
5|$|For example, the {{stability}} and low energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> cloud state in helium accounts for the element's chemical inertness, and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other, producing the lowest melting and boiling points of all the elements.|$|E

40|$|Two-electron {{correlated}} {{spectra of}} nonsequential double ionization below laser-intensity threshold {{are known to}} exhibit back-to-back scattering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrons,</b> i. e., <b>the</b> anticorrelation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrons.</b> Currently, <b>the</b> widely accepted interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anticorrelation is recollision-induced excitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ion plus subsequent field ionization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second <b>electron.</b> We argue that another mechanism, namely, simultaneous <b>electron</b> emission, when <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> return <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rescattered <b>electron</b> is equal to <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> liberation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bounded <b>electron</b> (i. e., <b>the</b> ion has no time for excitation), can also explain <b>the</b> anticorrelation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> in <b>the</b> deep, below laser-intensity threshold regime.

5|$|Although it is {{important}} in catabolism, NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as gluconeogenesis. This need for NADH in anabolism poses a problem for prokaryotes growing on nutrients that release {{only a small amount}} of energy. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH directly. As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> transport chain in reverse, generating NADH.|$|E
5|$|Each atomic orbital {{corresponds}} to a particular energy level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron.</b> The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by {{the differences in the}} energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines.|$|E

40|$|We outline {{a theory}} for {{conduction}} electron-spin resonance (CESR) in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite.

5|$|Electrons can {{transfer}} between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy {{that matches the}} difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the Auger effect. To escape the atom, the energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> must be increased above its binding energy to the atom. This occurs, for example, with the photoelectric effect, where an incident photon exceeding the atom's ionization energy is absorbed by the electron.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the general similarity in structure and function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> transport chains in eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea possess a large variety of electron-transfer enzymes. These use an equally wide set of chemicals as substrates. In common with eukaryotes, prokaryotic electron transport uses the energy released from the oxidation of a substrate to pump ions across a membrane and generate an electrochemical gradient. In the bacteria, oxidative phosphorylation in Escherichia coli is understood in most detail, while archaeal systems are at present poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|In {{laboratory}} conditions, {{the interactions}} of individual electrons can be observed by means of particle detectors, which allow measurement of specific properties such as energy, spin and charge. The development of the Paul trap and Penning trap allows charged particles to be contained within a small region for long durations. This enables precise measurements of the particle properties. For example, in one instance a Penning trap was used to contain a single electron {{for a period of}} 10 months. The magnetic moment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> was measured to a precision of eleven digits, which, in 1980, was a greater accuracy than for any other physical constant.|$|E

5|$|It {{should be}} noted that the {{relative}} atomic mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> Ar(e) is measured relative to the mass of a carbon-12 atom (divided by 12). When the Avogadro constant is set in the new SI, atomic masses might be measured in dalton (by fixing the Avogadro constant), instead of atomic mass units (by fixing the mass of carbon-12), thus resulting in a difference between the values of the relative atomic mass and the atomic mass in units of dalton.|$|E
5|$|Like the lanthanides, all {{actinides}} {{are highly}} reactive with halogens and chalcogens; however, the actinides react more easily. Actinides, {{especially those with}} {{a small number of}} 5f-electrons, are prone to hybridization. This is explained by the similarity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> energies at the 5f, 7s and 6d shells. Most actinides exhibit a larger variety of valence states, and the most stable are +6 for uranium, +5 for protactinium and neptunium, +4 for thorium and plutonium and +3 for actinium and other actinides.|$|E

5|$|Newly formed astatine-211 is {{the subject}} of ongoing {{research}} in nuclear medicine. It must be used quickly as it decays with a half-life of 7.2hours; this is long enough to permit multistep labeling strategies. Astatine-211 has potential for targeted alpha particle radiotherapy, since it decays either via emission of an alpha particle (to bismuth-207), or via electron capture (to an extremely short-lived nuclide, polonium-211, which undergoes further alpha decay). Polonium X-rays emitted as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> capture branch, in the range of 77–92keV, enable the tracking of astatine in animals and patients. Although astatine-210 has a slightly longer half-life, it is wholly unsuitable because it usually undergoes beta plus decay to the extremely toxic polonium-210.|$|E
5|$|Photons mediate {{electromagnetic}} {{interactions between}} particles in quantum electrodynamics. An isolated electron {{at a constant}} velocity cannot emit or absorb a real photon; doing so would violate conservation of energy and momentum. Instead, virtual photons can transfer momentum between two charged particles. This exchange of virtual photons, for example, generates the Coulomb force. Energy emission can occur when a moving electron is deflected by a charged particle, such as a proton. The acceleration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> results in the emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation.|$|E
