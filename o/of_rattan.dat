40|$|Rattans, or canes, {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} non-timber forest products supporting the livelihood of many forest-dwelling communities in South and North-eastern India. Due to increased demand for rattan products, rattans have been extracted indiscriminately from the Western Ghats, a 1600 -km mountain chain running parallel to the west coast of India. Extensive harvesting, loss of habitat and poor regeneration has resulted in dwindling rattan populations, necessitating an urgent attempt to conserve existing rattan resources. In this study, using niche-modelling tools, an attempt has been made to identify areas of high species richness <b>of</b> <b>rattans</b> in the Western Ghats, one of the mega-diversity regions of the world. We have also developed conservation values for 21 economically important and endemic <b>rattans</b> <b>of</b> the Western Ghats.

25|$|Like {{many other}} plants, palms have been {{threatened}} by human intervention and exploitation. The greatest risk to palms is destruction of habitat, {{especially in the}} tropical forests, due to urbanization, wood-chipping, mining, and conversion to farmland. Palms rarely reproduce after such great changes in the habitat, and those with small habitat ranges are most vulnerable to them. The harvesting of heart of palm, a delicacy in salads, also poses a threat because it {{is derived from the}} palm's apical meristem, {{a vital part of the}} palm that cannot be regrown (except in domesticated varieties, e.g. of peach palm). The use <b>of</b> <b>rattan</b> palms in furniture has caused a major population decrease in these species that has negatively affected local and international markets, as well as biodiversity in the area. The sale of seeds to nurseries and collectors is another threat, as the seeds of popular palms are sometimes harvested directly from the wild. At least 100 palm species are currently endangered, and nine species have reportedly recently become extinct.|$|E

40|$|Human-induced forest {{fragmentation}} poses one of {{the largest}} threats to global diversity yet its impact on rattans (climbing palms) has remained virtually unexplored. Rattan is arguably the world’s most valuable non-timber forest product though current levels of harvesting and land-use change place wild populations at risk. To assess rattan response to fragmentation exclusive of harvesting impacts we examined rattan abundance, demography and ecology within the forests of northeastern, Australia. We assessed the community abundance <b>of</b> <b>rattans,</b> and component adult (> 3 m) and juvenile (≤ 3 m) abundance in five intact forests and five fragments (23 – 58 ha) to determine their response to a range of environmental and ecological parameters. Fragmented forests supported higher abundances <b>of</b> <b>rattans</b> than intact forests. Fragment size and edge degradation significantly increased adult rattan abundance, with more in smaller fragments and near edges. Our findings suggest that rattan increase within fragments is due to canopy disturbance of forest edges resulting in preferential, high-light habitat. However, adult and juvenile rattans may respond inconsistently to fragmentation. In managed forest fragments, a rattan abundance increase may provide economic benefits through sustainable harvesting practices. However, rattan increases in protected area forest fragments could negatively impact conservation outcomes. Peer reviewe...|$|R
