40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{effect of}} horizontal rectus surgery on sub-A or sub-V pattern intermittent exotropia. We enrolled patients with sub-A or sub-V pattern intermittent exotropia. The sub-A pattern was diagnosed when the eyes diverged less than 10 prism diopters (PD) from upgaze to downgaze, and sub-V pattern when the divergence was 14 PD or less from downgaze to upgaze. Patients had undergone horizontal rectus surgery without vertical transposition of horizontal rectus muscle or oblique muscle weakening. The patients {{were divided into}} two groups: sub-A pattern (group A) and sub-V pattern (group V). The outcome measures were change <b>of</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>pattern</b> and rate <b>of</b> collapse <b>of</b> <b>pattern</b> postoperatively. The amount <b>of</b> <b>pattern</b> (vertical incomitance) was amount of difference in exodeviation between upgaze and downgaze. Collapse <b>of</b> <b>pattern</b> was defined as disappearance of difference in exodeviation between upgaze and downgaze. In groups A and V, preoperative amounts <b>of</b> <b>pattern</b> were 4. 9 PD and 6. 8 PD, respectively. A significant reduction in amount <b>of</b> <b>pattern</b> was observed in both groups throughout the follow-up period (p< 0. 05). At postoperative 6 months, the amounts <b>of</b> <b>pattern</b> were 1. 0 PD and 1. 2 PD and the extents of reduction in amount <b>of</b> <b>pattern</b> were 4. 4 PD and 5. 9 PD.

40|$|Identifying scales <b>of</b> <b>pattern</b> in {{ecological}} systems and coupling patterns to processes that create them are ongoing challenges. We examined {{the utility of}} three techniques (lacunarity, spectral, and wavelet analysis) for detecting scales <b>of</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> ecological data. We compared the information obtained using these methods for four datasets, including: surface temperature across space (linear transect). surface temperature across time, understory plant diversity across space (linear transect), and a simulated series of known structure. For temperature and plant diversity across the transect, we expected to find dominant scales <b>of</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> approximately 220 m and, for plant diversity scales <b>of</b> <b>pattern</b> of> 450 m, corresponding to management activities on the study landscapes. For temperature across time, we predicted a dominant scale of 24 h. The simulated data included a sine wave with a known period of 9. 9 units, an edge at approximately 30 units, and a random component. The different analyses provided unique but complementary information. Lacunarity and spectral analyses were most consistent with each other across datasets, both indicating a dominant scale <b>of</b> <b>pattern</b> at 400 - 500 m (coarser than expected) for the transect temperature series, a lack of dominant scale in the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> understory diversity, and scales <b>of</b> <b>pattern</b> at 1. 8 - 5. 1 and 8. 5 - 1 1. 1 units (=wavelength) for the simulated data series. Spectral analysis best approximated an expected, 24 h period in the temporal temperature series.

5|$|A real {{physical}} tessellation is a tiling made {{of materials}} such as cemented ceramic squares or hexagons. Such tilings may be decorative patterns, or may have functions such as providing durable and water-resistant pavement, floor or wall coverings. Historically, tessellations were used in Ancient Rome and in Islamic art {{such as in the}} decorative geometric tiling of the Alhambra palace. In the twentieth century, the work of M. C. Escher often made use of tessellations, both in ordinary Euclidean geometry and in hyperbolic geometry, for artistic effect. Tessellations are sometimes employed for decorative effect in quilting. Tessellations form a class <b>of</b> <b>patterns</b> in nature, for example in the arrays of hexagonal cells found in honeycombs.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{studies are}} {{necessarily}} holistic {{as opposed to}} reductionistic. Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description <b>of</b> <b>patterns</b> in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations {{without reference to the}} whole system, which leads to 3) a metaphysical hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without reference to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from mysticism that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the biomolecular properties of the exterior shells.|$|E

More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the guineafowl Numida meleagris in which the individual feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to an array of dots at the far (distal) end. These require an oscillation created by two inhibiting signals, with interactions in both space and time.|$|E
