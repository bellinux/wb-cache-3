5|$|In July 2008, Christian Bale was {{filming a}} scene in New Mexico for the film Terminator Salvation with actress Bryce Dallas Howard. The film's {{director}} of photography, Shane Hurlbut, walked into Bale's line <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> <b>and</b> the actor proceeded to yell obscenities at Hurlbut. Bale said he would quit the film if Hurlbut repeated the error and was not subsequently fired. Hurlbut responded calmly and apologized several times to Bale, and continued shooting for seven hours after the incident.|$|E
5|$|Termites with {{colonies in}} close {{proximity}} to houses can extend their galleries underground and make mud tubes to enter homes. The insects keep out <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>and</b> chew their way through structural and decorative timbers, leaving the surface layers intact, as well as through cardboard, plastic and insulation materials. Their presence may become apparent when winged insects appear and swarm in the home in spring. Control and extermination is a professional job involving trying to exclude the insects from the building and trying to kill those already present. Soil-applied liquid termiticides provide a chemical barrier that prevents termites from entering buildings, and lethal baits can be used; these are eaten by foraging insects, and carried back to the nest and shared {{with other members of the}} colony, which goes into slow decline.|$|E
5|$|Susan was {{diagnosed}} with Multiple sclerosis in 2007. Two years prior, MS Australia pitched a storyline to the Neighbours team asking for a character to be diagnosed with MS and for them to then show the impact MS can have on a community. The society contacted a producer and discussed a possible storyline for a young character in her twenties who had a promising career and family ahead of her. In 2006, the society {{received a phone call}} from one of the writers who revealed that they had chosen to write an MS story into the show and they had selected Susan Kennedy to be the character that was going to be diagnosed. The society was initially disappointed, as Susan was older than the typical person diagnosed with the condition. However, they were pleased that a permanent character and not an extra was chosen. MS Australia attended a meeting with the Neighbours writers to help develop a realistic and true portrayal of the diagnosis, symptoms and treatments. On-screen Susan was seen displaying unusual symptoms, including black outs and loss <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>and</b> sensation in her hands. She was then seen undergoing an MRI scan, before she {{was diagnosed}} with multiple sclerosis.|$|E

25|$|The {{emission}} lines seen on {{the spectrum}} of a Seyfert galaxy may come {{from the surface of}} the accretion disc itself, or may come from clouds of gas illuminated by the central engine in an ionization cone. The exact geometry of the emitting region is difficult to determine due to poor resolution of the galactic center. However, each part of the accretion disc has a different velocity relative to our line <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> <b>and</b> the faster the gas is rotating around the black hole, the broader the emission line will be. Similarly, an illuminated disc wind also has a position-dependent velocity.|$|E
25|$|In these systems, the {{separation}} between the stars is usually very small, and the orbital velocity very high. Unless {{the plane of the}} orbit happens to be perpendicular to the line of sight, the orbital velocities will have components in the line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>and</b> the observed radial velocity of the system will vary periodically. Since radial velocity can be measured with a spectrometer by observing the Doppler shift of the stars' spectral lines, the binaries detected in this manner are known as spectroscopic binaries. Most of these cannot be resolved as a visual binary, even with telescopes of the highest existing resolving power.|$|E
