5|$|As {{pointed out}} by Paul Krugman, the Brander–Spencer model, due to the {{sensitivity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> to its assumptions, does not establish a generally applicable policy prescription in favor of government subsidies. Rather, it provides an example for when such intervention may be justifiable and points to some conditions which may favor it.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{proposed}} that each chemical element {{is composed of}} atoms of a single, unique type, and though they cannot be altered or destroyed by chemical means, they can combine to form more complex structures (chemical compounds). This marked the first truly scientific theory of the atom, since Dalton reached his conclusions by experimentation and examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> in an empirical fashion.|$|E

5|$|Information {{from the}} sense organs is {{collected}} in the brain. There {{it is used to}} determine what actions the organism is to take. The brain processes the raw data to extract information about the structure of the environment. Next it combines the processed information with information about the current needs of the animal and with memory of past circumstances. Finally, on the basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results,</b> it generates motor response patterns. These signal-processing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems.|$|E
5|$|Löwig {{isolated}} bromine from {{a mineral}} water spring from his hometown Bad Kreuznach in 1825. Löwig used {{a solution of}} the mineral salt saturated with chlorine and extracted the bromine with diethyl ether. After evaporation of the ether a brown liquid remained. With this liquid as a sample of his work he applied for {{a position in the}} laboratory of Leopold Gmelin in Heidelberg. The publication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> was delayed and Balard published his results first.|$|E
5|$|The curve-shortening flow, {{and many}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> about the curve-shortening flow, can be {{generalized}} from the Euclidean plane to any two-dimensional Riemannian manifold. In {{order to avoid}} additional types of singularity, {{it is important for}} the manifold to be convex at infinity; this is defined to mean that every compact set has a compact convex hull, as defined using geodesic convexity. The curve-shortening flow cannot cause a curve to depart from its convex hull, so this condition prevents parts of the curve from reaching the boundary of the manifold.|$|E
50|$|A {{somewhat}} more complex side chain is incorporated by alkylation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carbanion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> substituted cyanoacetate (1) with 2-chloroethylmethyl sulfide (2).

5|$|The late 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries saw Americans leaving the Eastern Seaboard to settle further inland. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> {{was that the}} PCUSA signed a Plan of Union with the Congregationalists of New England in 1801, which formalized {{cooperation}} between the two bodies and attempted to provide adequate visitation and preaching for frontier congregations, along with eliminating rivalry between the two denominations. The large growth rate of the Presbyterian Church in the Northeast was {{in part due to}} the adoption of Congregationalist settlers along the western frontier.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} that vanadium or vanadium compounds are reproductive toxins or teratogens. Vanadium pentoxide was reported to be carcinogenic in male rats and in male and female mice by inhalation in an NTP study, although the interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> has recently been disputed. The carcinogenicity of vanadium has not been determined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E
5|$|When a cell's DNA {{is damaged}} by a virus, {{and if the}} cell cannot repair itself, this often {{triggers}} apoptosis. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of apoptosis is destruction of the damaged DNA by the cell itself. Some viruses have mechanisms to limit apoptosis so that the host cell does not die before progeny viruses have been produced; HIV, for example, does this.|$|E
