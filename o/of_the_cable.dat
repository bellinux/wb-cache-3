5|$|Gliders {{are often}} {{launched}} using a stationary ground-based winch {{mounted on a}} heavy vehicle. This method is widely used at many European clubs, often {{in addition to an}} aerotow service. The engine is usually powered by LPG, petrol or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> length after a short, steep ride. A strong headwind will result in higher launches.|$|E

5|$|It is {{reported}} that this {{problem with the}} CL contributed to the bankruptcy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> company in 1888. However, electric motor traction had been considered all along, and much engineering progress had been made since the tunnel's construction had begun in 1886. So, CL chairman Charles Grey Mott decided to switch to electric traction. Other cable-operated systems using the Hallidie patents continued to be designed, such as the Glasgow Subway which opened in 1896.|$|E
5|$|The Patent Cable Tramway Corporation {{owned the}} rights to the Hallidie {{cable-car}} system first invented and used in San Francisco in 1873; trains were attached to the cable with clamps, which would be opened and closed at stations, allowing the carriages to disconnect and reconnect without needing to stop the cable or to interfere with other trains sharing the cable. There were to be two independent endless cables, one between City station and Elephant and Castle moving at 10mph, and the other between Elephant and Castle and Stockwell, where the gradient was less, at 12mph. However, the additional length of tunnel permitted by the supplementary acts challenged the practicality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> system.|$|E
5|$|The USB {{standard}} specifies relatively loose tolerances for compliant USB connectors {{to minimize}} physical incompatibilities in connectors from different vendors. To address a weakness present {{in some other}} connector standards, the USB specification also defines limits {{to the size of}} a connecting device in the area around its plug. This was done to prevent a device from blocking adjacent ports due to the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> strain relief mechanism (usually molding integral with the cable outer insulation) at the connector. Compliant devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a compliant extension cable that does.|$|E

5|$|Brian Lamb, C-SPAN's {{chairman}} and {{former chief executive}} officer, first conceived the concept of C-SPAN in 1975 while working as the Washington, D.C. bureau chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> industry trade magazine Cablevision. It {{was a time of}} rapid {{growth in the number of}} cable television channels available in the United States, and Lamb envisioned a cable-industry financed nonprofit network for televising sessions of the U.S. Congress and other public affairs event and policy discussions. Lamb shared his idea with several cable executives, who helped him launch the network. Among them were Bob Rosencrans who provided $25,000 of initial funding in 1979 and John D. Evans who provided the wiring and access to the headend needed for the distribution of the C-SPAN signal.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{decided to}} return to a gameplay style similar to the original Genesis Sonic games, which producer Yuji Naka felt was refreshing. Despite this, they also included concepts that were incorporated in the Dreamcast games, such as the ability to grind on rails and and the modernized character designs by Yuji Uekawa. As the Sonic games released for the Dreamcast allowed players to download the Chao Garden minigame onto the VMU, the development team decided to expand upon this idea by implementing a similar minigame that was compatible with the GameCube's GBA link cable, thus making Sonic Advance one of the first games to make use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable.</b> It also makes use of graphical techniques such as rotation effects and Mode 7. The game's musical score was composed by Yutaka Minobe and Tatsuyuki Maeda.|$|E

40|$|The first {{adjustable}} feed {{support system}} in FAST is a six-cable-driven parallel manipulator. Due to flexibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cables,</b> <b>the</b> cable-driven parallel manipulator bears {{a concern of}} possible vibration caused by wind disturbance or internal force from the fine drive system. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this paper is to}} analyze vibration characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six-cable-driven parallel manipulator in FAST. The tension equilibrium equation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six-cable-driven parallel manipulator is set up regarding <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> as catenaries. Then, vibration equation is established considering <b>the</b> longitudinal vibration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cables.</b> On this basis, the natural frequencies are depicted in figures since both analytical and numerical solutions are ineffective. Influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sags <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> on <b>the</b> natural frequencies is discussed.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> a new steerable tip for a laparoscopic instrument. A new tip {{design is}} required since current steerable tip designs {{have problems with}} the bending stiffness and <b>the</b> lifespan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cables.</b> Underaction is a main cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low tip stiffness. Since one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design requirements is that the tip {{needs to be able}} to rotate in two perpendicular planes, the tip has two rotational degrees <b>of</b> freedom (DOF). <b>The</b> simplest way to fully actuate the tip and to rotate each DOF over 90 degrees in a clockwise (CW) and counter clockwise (CCW) direction is by using two cables for each DOF, resulting in a total <b>of</b> four <b>cables</b> in <b>the</b> tip. A limiting factor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lifespan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tip is <b>the</b> fatigue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cables.</b> <b>The</b> fatigue is <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> being forced to make a sharp bend during a rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tip. To reduce <b>the</b> fatigue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cables,</b> <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> therefore need to be guided and to make a bend as large as possible in a g 5 mm tip. As a prove of concept, two prototypes have been produced. From these prototypes it can be concluded that each DOF in the tip is able to rotate up to an angle of 90 degrees in CW and CCW direction. It can also be concluded that the tip is fully actuated. <b>The</b> bending stiffness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tip therefore only depends on <b>the</b> stiffness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> and <b>the</b> rigid bodies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tip. Since <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> and rigid bodies will be produced from steel, <b>the</b> bending stiffness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tip will be high. Considering <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> to have a diameter of 0. 5 mm, <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> will be guided over a guiding with a radius of 3. 48 mm. Compared to the EndoWrist, where <b>the</b> radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pulley with similar cables would be 2 mm, the radius is almost 1. 75 as large. The result is that <b>the</b> lifespan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> in <b>the</b> new design will be superior. BMDBioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
