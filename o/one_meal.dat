5|$|Agouti {{species are}} one of the few animal groups that can break open the large {{capsules}} of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in <b>one</b> <b>meal,</b> so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in <b>one</b> <b>meal</b> and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.|$|E
5|$|These snakes {{do well in}} captivity, {{but there}} are reports of gluttony. Kauffeld (1969) {{mentions}} that specimens can be maintained for years on only <b>one</b> <b>meal</b> per week, but that when offered all they can eat, the result is often death, or at best wholesale regurgitation. They are bad-tempered snakes and some specimens never settle down in captivity, always hissing and puffing when approached.|$|E

5|$|The detainees at Omarska had <b>one</b> <b>meal</b> a day. The {{food was}} usually spoiled {{and the process}} of getting the food, eating and {{returning}} the plate usually lasted around three minutes. Meals were often accompanied by beatings. The toilets were blocked and there was human waste everywhere. British journalist Ed Vulliamy testified that when he visited the camp, the detainees were in very poor physical condition. He witnessed them eating a bowl of soup and some bread and said that he had the impression they had not eaten in a long time; they appeared terrified. According to Vulliamy, the detainees drank water from a river that was polluted with industrial waste and many suffered from constipation or dysentery. No criminal report was ever filed against persons detained in the Omarska camp, nor were the detainees apprised of any concrete charges against them. Apparently, there was no legitimate reason justifying these people’s detention.|$|E
5|$|Yen {{described}} the {{role as the}} most emotionally and mentally difficult in his career. He spent months preparing for the role by going on a strict diet which consisted of eating <b>one</b> <b>meal</b> a day, training in Wing Chun, and learning more about Ip Man through his two sons. This was all {{in the hopes of}} portraying an erudite and cultured Ip Man, as well as bringing out the special traits of Wing Chun. Yen even went as far as to stay in character after filming, wearing his costume and changing his voice and movement patterns. While rehearsing a fight scene, Yen was reportedly injured when an axe wielder accidentally slashed the side of his left eye. Yen also had a masseur on set as he could not raise his right shoulder due to an injury.|$|E
5|$|Metallica {{released}} {{their debut}} album Kill 'Em All on the independent label Megaforce Records in July 1983. The album helped to establish thrash metal, a heavy metal subgenre defined by its brisk riffs and intense percussion. After finishing its promotional tour, Metallica began composing new material and from September began performing {{the songs that}} were to make up Ride the Lightning at concerts. Because the band had little money, its members often ate <b>one</b> <b>meal</b> a day and stayed at fans' homes while playing clubs across the US. An incident occurred when part of Metallica's gear was stolen in Boston, and Anthrax lent Metallica its equipment to complete the remaining dates. When not gigging, the band stayed in a rented house in El Cerrito, California, called the Metallica Mansion. Frontman James Hetfield felt uneasy about performing double duty on vocals and rhythm guitar so the band offered the job to Armored Saint singer John Bush, who turned down the offer because Armored Saint was doing well at the time. Hetfield gradually built confidence as lead vocalist and kept his original role. Metallica started recording on February 20, 1984 at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The album was produced by Flemming Rasmussen, founder of Sweet Silence, {{who went on to}} produce the band's next two albums. Drummer Lars Ulrich chose Rasmussen because he liked his work on Rainbow's Difficult to Cure (1981) and was keen to record in Europe. Rasmussen, who had not heard of Metallica, agreed to work on the album, even though his studio employees questioned the band's talent. Rasmussen listened to Metallica's tapes before the members arrived and thought the band had great potential. Metallica rehearsed the album's material at Mercyful Fate's practice room in Copenhagen.|$|E

25|$|In Yoga principle, it is {{recommended}} that one maintains a spiritual fast on a particular day each week (Monday or Thursday). A fast should also be maintained on the full moon day of each month. It is essential on the spiritual fasting day to not only to abstain from meals, but also to spend the whole day with a positive, spiritual attitude. On the fasting day, intake of solid food during the day is avoided and only a light veggie meal around 5 o'clock is taken. Water can be taken any time as needed. If health does not permit fasting for a whole day, for example with Diabetes, careful planning is done to reduce or skip <b>one</b> <b>meal.</b>|$|E
25|$|The paid firemen had no days off, {{were not}} allowed to leave their post except for <b>one</b> <b>meal,</b> and were seldom allowed to leave the firehouse unless on fire {{business}} or a family emergency. An ordinance in 1859 made it illegal to give firemen alcoholic beverages. Their clothes were irregular; uniforms were not worn until 1874, with a regulation uniform established in 1928. Firemen had to buy their own uniforms until 1943, when a $60 clothing allowance was established. An attempt to remove politics from the fire department was not very successful; it was necessary to mandate that the department staff be half Republican and half Democrat, and the role of fire chief was based on political affiliation and family contacts.|$|E

25|$|When {{business}} slowed {{after the}} move, Vincent Sardi sought a gimmick to attract customers. Recalling the movie star caricatures that decorated {{the walls of}} Joe Zelli’s, a Parisian restaurant and jazz club, Sardi decided to recreate that effect in his establishment.

Sardi and Gard drew up a contract that stated Gard would make the caricatures in exchange for <b>one</b> <b>meal</b> per day at the restaurant. The first official caricature by Gard was of Ted Healy, the vaudevillian of Three Stooges fame. When Sardi’s son, Vincent Sardi Jr. (1915–2007), took over restaurant operations in 1947, he offered to change the terms of Gard's agreement. Gard refused and continued to draw the caricatures in exchange for meals until his death.|$|E
