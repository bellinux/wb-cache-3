40|$|Green algae, {{especially}} Cladophora species, {{are generally}} considered {{as the best}} bioindicator of aquatic bodies contamination by nutrients {{as well as by}} heavy metals. Therefore, the object of this Study was to investigate to which extent toxic metals (Ni, V, Cd, Pb, Cr) are present in algal biomass and to establish the bioaccumulation coefficients in correlated algae/water environments in a sewage lagoon, which represents the tertiary stage of a refinery waste water treatment plant (Slovnaft, Bratislava). Due to the <b>orographic</b> <b>depression</b> between the Eastern Alps and Western Carpathians and the characteristic atmospheric circulation with predominance of NW wind direction, the deposition of heavy metal aerosols from closed industrial activities is expected to contribute to bioaccumulation capacities of algae for these elements. The water of the refinery sewage lagoon has been monitored for BOD, COD, petroleum hydrocarbons, pH, BTX, halogenated hydrocarbons, some polyaromates, phosphates, ammonium, sulfates and suspended matter. From the viewpoint of heavy metal contents in agricultural composts, a management scenario for algal biomass reutilization, i. e. recycling nutrients and proteins back into the biosphere, via compost processing, is proposed...|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the eects of the atmospheric emissions of two signicant industrial centres of the Danube Lowland: the Schwechat and Slovnaft reneries. In this connection the environmental pollution of emission zones by heavy metals on the base of selected bioindicators (soil, lucerne, wheat, earthworms) should be evaluated. The phenomenon of the atmospheric impact of heavy metal aerosols on the food chain and substance transfer for the model studied (soil- plants- terrestrial invertebrates) was quantied by transfer (bioaccumulation) factors. Due to the <b>orographic</b> <b>depression</b> between the Eastern Alps and Western Carpathian Mountains and the characteristic atmospheric cir-culation with a predomint an north-west wind direction, heavy metal aerosols from closed industrial activities are expected to influence the quality of the surrounding environment. However, most of the 112 top soil samples taken from arable elds in the Schwechat District (Austria) showed natural levels of heavy metals. Heavy metal uptake by wheat via the soil was also rather low. At the Slovakian moni-toring site the heavy metal bioaccumulation within the lucerne, as a consequence of availability from the soil, was slightly increased and a considerably higher transfer factor was recorded in related earthworm tissues. Cadmium content in the earthworms exceeded the recommended limit for agricultural feed...|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} maps {{of atmospheric}} water (H 2 O) and its deuterated form (HDO) across the martian globe, showing strong isotopic anomalies {{and a significant}} high deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) enrichment indicative of great water loss. The maps sample the evolution of sublimation from the north polar cap, revealing that the released water has a representative D/H value enriched {{by a factor of}} about 7 relative to Earth's ocean [Vienna standard mean ocean water (VSMOW) ]. Certain basins and <b>orographic</b> <b>depressions</b> show even higher enrichment, whereas high-altitude regions show much lower values (1 to 3 VSMOW). Our atmospheric maps indicate that water ice in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium to at least 8 VSMOW, which would mean that early Mars (4. 5 billion years ago) had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep...|$|R
50|$|P. R. Pisharoty {{was born}} on February 10, 1909 {{in the town of}} Kollengode in the Indian state of Kerala.His parents were Sivaramakrishnan alias Gopala Vadhyar and Lakshmi Pisharassiar. He had three brothers: Chakrapani,Balakrishnan and Rajagopal, and three half brothers: Vaidyanathan, Rose Vadhyar and Gopalakrishnan. He {{completed}} his early education in Kerala. Having done his Physics BA honours from St. Joseph's College, Trichinopoly, Madras state, he went on to do his MA (Physics) from Madras University. He then worked as a college lecturer in Physics at Loyola College at Chennai during 1932-1941. During the summer vacations he used to work under Prof. C. V. Raman at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. On the recommendation of Raman, Pisharoty joined the India Meteorological Department in 1942, where he carried out research on thunderstorms, western disturbances, movement of monsoon <b>depressions,</b> <b>orographic</b> rain, etc. He then joined the University of California for further studies where he worked under meteorologist Jacob Bjerknes. His published two reports titled Some aspects of geostrophic poleward sensible heat and The kinetic energy of the atmosphere. He obtained his MS (in Meteorology) and PhD degrees by 1954.|$|R
40|$|CEOP {{has contributed}} and will {{continue}} to provide integrated data sets from diverse platforms for better understanding of the water and energy cycles, and for validaintg models. In this talk, I will show examples of how CEOP has contributed to the formulation of a strategy {{for the study of the}} monsoon as a system. The CEOP data concept has led to the development of the CEOP Inter-Monsoon Studies (CIMS), which focuses on the identification of model bias, and improvement of model physics such as the diurnal and annual cycles. A multi-model validation project focusing on diurnal variability of the East Asian monsoon, and using CEOP reference site data, as well as CEOP integrated satellite data is now ongoing. Preliminary studies show that climate models have difficulties in simulating the diurnal signals of total rainfall, rainfall intensity and frequency of occurrence, which have different peak hours, depending on locations. Further more model diurnal cycle of rainfall in monsoon regions tend to lead the observed by about 2 - 3 hours. These model bias offer insight into lack of, or poor representation of, key components of the convective and stratiform rainfall. The CEOP data also stimulated studies to compare and contrasts monsoon variability in different parts of the world. It was found that seasonal wind reversal, <b>orographic</b> effects, monsoon <b>depressions,</b> meso-scale convective complexes, SST and land surface land influences are common features in all monsoon regions. Strong intraseasonal variability is present in all monsoon regions. While there is a clear demarcation of onset, breaks and withdrawal in the Asian and Australian monsoon region associated with climatological intraseasonal variabillity, it is less clear in the American and Africa monsoon regions. The examination of satellite and reference site data in monsoon has led to preliminary model experiments to study the impact of aerosol on monsoon variability. I will show examples of how the study of the dynamics of aerosol-water cycle interactions in the monsoon region, can be best achieved using the CEOP data and modeling strategy...|$|R
