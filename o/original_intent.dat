5|$|As a British {{withdrawal}} from France {{at the earliest}} opportunity had been the <b>original</b> <b>intent,</b> the brigade boarded ships bound for Italy eleven days after landing. The operation had cost the brigade 362 casualties, but this did not hinder their next mission in Greece two months later. Only 126 replacements were required to bring the brigade back up to full strength.|$|E
5|$|The state {{responded by}} {{establishing}} the Department of Divinity ("jingikan") in 1869. This government bureaucracy encouraged the segregation of Kami spirits from Buddhist ones, and emphasized the divine lineage of the Emperor from the Sun Goddess, Amaterasu. This action sought to reverse {{what had been}} a blending of Buddhist and Shinto practices in Japan. That department was unsuccessful, and demoted to a Ministry. In 1872, policy for Shrines and other religions was taken over by the Ministry of Education. The Ministry intended to standardize rituals across shrines, and saw some small success, but fell short of its <b>original</b> <b>intent.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are varying {{interpretations of}} the <b>original</b> <b>intent</b> of Congress and of the ratifying states, based on {{statements}} made during the congressional debate over the amendment, {{as well as the}} customs and understandings prevalent at that time.

5|$|Balabushka used Titlist blanks until 1966 {{when he was}} {{contacted}} by Chicagoan Burton Spain. Spain had recently begun making handmade spliced blanks and was supplying them to Balabushka's closest rival, Frank Paradise. Spain had become fascinated by splicing technology when he came upon a Titlist cue split down the middle in 1965 {{and set out to}} perfect and even improve on the Titlist splice. Spain's <b>original</b> <b>intent</b> was to be predominantly a cuemaker in his own right using his proprietary spliced blanks. However, by 1966 Spain's superior blanks were in high demand and he instead turned to making blanks for other cuemakers full-time, which he continued until 1970.|$|E
5|$|Camp's new {{scrimmage}} rules {{revolutionized the}} game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play {{to slow the}} game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each down. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's <b>original</b> <b>intent,</b> the rule was exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined {{with the establishment of}} the line of scrimmage, transformed the game from a variation of rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.|$|E
5|$|Vice-Admiral Mariot Arbuthnot, the British fleet {{commander}} in North America, {{was aware that}} Destouches was planning something, but did not learn of Destouches' sailing until 10 March, and immediately led his fleet out of Gardiner Bay in pursuit. He {{had the advantage of}} favourable winds, and reached Cape Henry on 16 March, slightly ahead of Destouches. Although suffering a tactical defeat, Arbuthnot was able to pull into Chesapeake Bay, thus frustrating the <b>original</b> <b>intent</b> of Destouches' mission, forcing the French fleet to return to Newport. After transports delivered 2,000 men to reinforce Arnold, Arbuthnot returned to New York. He resigned his post as station chief in July and left for England, ending a stormy, difficult, and unproductive relationship with General Clinton.|$|E

Although her husband's family loves her, she still misses her family in the capital and therefore is a now tragic figure.

5|$|It was {{not until}} the mid-1350s that {{military}} operations on the Continent were resumed on a large scale. In 1356, Edward's eldest son, Edward, the Black Prince, won an important victory in the Battle of Poitiers. The greatly outnumbered English forces not only routed the French, but captured the French king, John II and his youngest son, Philip. After a succession of victories, the English held great possessions in France, the French king was in English custody, and the French central government had almost totally collapsed. There has been a historical debate as to whether Edward's claim to the French crown originally was genuine, or if it was simply a political ploy meant to put pressure on the French government. Regardless of the <b>original</b> <b>intent,</b> the stated claim now seemed to be within reach. Yet a campaign in 1359, meant to complete the undertaking, was inconclusive. In 1360, therefore, Edward accepted the Treaty of Brétigny, whereby he renounced his claims to the French throne, but secured his extended French possessions in full sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} a {{concentric}} fortress, which von Haschenperg had hoped would combine the best of Italian military architecture, able to carry heavy guns but with a low profile to protect against any incoming artillery fire. Various flaws rapidly became apparent. The castle's design had focused on defence, {{with the result that}} the guns could not easily be brought to bear on enemy vessels, which had been the <b>original</b> <b>intent</b> of building the fortification by the Camber; some of the angles of fire from the defences were blocked by the entrance and the high water table may have caused serious damp problems on the ground floor. Furthermore, the design was different from the other Device Forts constructed across the region and would have stood out as unusual and not in keeping with the King's general intent for the chain of forts.|$|E
5|$|The 1986 SQL {{standard}} basically adopted Codd's proposal {{after an}} implementation prototype in IBM System R. Although Don Chamberlin recognized nulls (alongside duplicate rows) {{as one of}} the most controversial features of SQL, he defended the design of Nulls in SQL invoking the pragmatic arguments that it was the least expensive form of system support for missing information, saving the programmer from many duplicative application-level checks (see semipredicate problem) while at the same time providing the database designer with the option not to use Nulls if he so desires; for example, in order to avoid well known anomalies (discussed in the semantics section of this article). Chamberlin also argued that besides providing some missing-value functionality, practical experience with Nulls also led to other language features which rely on Nulls, like certain grouping constructs and outer joins. Finally, he argued that in practice Nulls also end up being used as a quick way to patch an existing schema when it needs to evolve beyond its <b>original</b> <b>intent,</b> coding not for missing but rather for inapplicable information; for example, a database that quickly needs to support electric cars while having a miles-per-gallon column.|$|E

50|$|Redologists {{think she}} will {{play a part in}} the {{original}} work's ending. In Gao E's ending, Miaoyu is abducted by robbers, and Jia Xichun becomes her friend. This abduction leads to Jia Xichun's decision to become a nun in her place. But many Redologists point out that this ending is in conflict with Zhiyanzhai's commentaries and with the foreshadowings in preceding chapters. It is likely Gao E's version is not in line with Cao Xueqin's <b>original</b> <b>intents,</b> although her final fate remains open to speculation.|$|R

40|$|Ethnography {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{qualitative}} methods, yet increasingly, researchers from various disciplines are using and adapting ethnography beyond its <b>original</b> <b>intents.</b> In particular, a form of ethnography known as "focused ethnography" has emerged. However, focused ethnography remains underspecified methodologically, which has contributed to controversy about its essential nature and value. Nevertheless, an ever-evolving range of research settings, purposes, and questions require appropriate methodological innovation. Using the example of a focused ethnography conducted to study nurses' work experiences, this article will demonstrate how particular research questions, the attributes of certain cultural groups, and the unique characteristics of specific researchers compel adaptations in ethnography that address the need for methodological evolution while still preserving the essential nature of the method.

25|$|Perhaps {{the clearest}} example to {{illustrate}} {{the importance of the}} difference between <b>original</b> <b>intent</b> and original understanding is to use the Twenty-seventh Amendment. The Twenty-seventh Amendment was proposed as part of the Bill of Rights in 1791, but failed to be ratified by the required number of states for two centuries, eventually being ratified in 1992. An <b>original</b> <b>intent</b> inquiry might ask what the framers understood the amendment to mean when it was written, though some would argue that it was the intent of the latter-day ratifiers that is important. An original-meaning inquiry would ask what the plain, public meaning of the text was in 1992 when it was eventually ratified.|$|E

40|$|The {{human-centered design}} of {{information}} technology must take into account, not just the single user, but a whole mosaic of larger social systems, like workgroups, families, organizations, communities, markets and culture. Changes in information technology not only alter these individual systems, but alter the very structure of the mosaic itself. These various systems, from individuals to organizations to markets, try to respond and adapt to the changes. In effect, they undertake their own “design” efforts, sometimes at odds with our <b>original</b> <b>intents.</b> Our intentional design will be more successful if we become more mindful of this grand Mosaic of Responsive Adaptive Systems (MoRAS).

The analysis indicates that the designs of both policies are fairly robust with relatively minor divergence.
