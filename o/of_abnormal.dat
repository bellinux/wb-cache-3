30|$|As Fig. 9 a is a {{comprehensive}} overlook at the whole virtual machine, we’d like to further identify which process caused the abnormals. Take the peak during 103 – 113  s as example, firstly we correspond each abnormal hypercall to a process by translating the CR 3 value to pid, then we extract the most frequent process which is the biggest suspect. Finally, we analysis the distribution <b>of</b> <b>abnormals</b> <b>of</b> this process, whose result is in Fig. 9 b.

40|$|SUMMARY-The {{incidence}} of chromosome aberrations and <b>of</b> cells with <b>abnormal</b> chromosome complements was estimatecf in the thymus, spleen, and bone marrow of preleukemic, leukemic, and nonleukemic C 57 BL/ 6 J mice that received repeated total-body irradiations. In {{early stages of}} leukemogenesis the normal cell populations of the thymus, spleen, and bone marrow, consisting predominantly of diploid cells, changed into genetically heterogeneous ones, consisting <b>of</b> cells with <b>abnormal</b> chromosome numbers, marker chromosomes, or both. At 7 weeks after irradiation the incidence <b>of</b> chromosomally <b>abnormal</b> cells in the spleen and bone marrow was greatly reduced, whereas clones <b>of</b> chromosomally <b>abnormal</b> cells became established in the thymus of most irradiated mice. All 10 thymic lymphosarcomas examined consisted <b>of</b> cells with <b>abnormal</b> chromosome complements. The presence of particular marker chromosomes in most leukemic cells of a mouse suggests that they originate From one parent cell. Clones <b>of</b> chromosomally <b>abnormal</b> cells were also observe...|$|R

5|$|Apo{{lipoprotein}} B, in its ApoB100 form, is {{the main}} apolipoprotein, or protein part of the lipoprotein particle. Its gene {{is located on the}} second chromosome (2p24-p23) and is between 21.08 and 21.12Mb long. FH is often associated with the mutation of R3500Q, which causes replacement of arginine by glutamine at position 3500. The mutation is located on a part of the protein that normally binds with the LDL receptor, and binding is reduced {{as a result of the}} mutation. Like LDLR, the number <b>of</b> <b>abnormal</b> copies determines the severity of the hypercholesterolemia.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} such as dilated cardiomyopathy, where the heart becomes weakened and enlarged, and sick sinus syndrome, which is a type <b>of</b> <b>abnormal</b> heart beating which causes low blood pressure, {{have been identified in}} the breed. Phosphofructokinase deficiency is a condition caused by a recessive gene in the breed which prevents the metabolism of glucose into energy, causing the dog to have extremely low energy and be unable to exercise. The gene which causes this appears in around 10 percent of the population, but DNA testing can prevent two carrier dogs from breeding and thus creating puppies with this condition.|$|E

5|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) is {{the development}} of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), due to the administration of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant. HIT predisposes to thrombosis (the abnormal formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel) because platelets release microparticles that activate thrombin, thereby leading to thrombosis. When thrombosis is identified the condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT is caused by the formation <b>of</b> <b>abnormal</b> antibodies that activate platelets. If someone receiving heparin develops new or worsening thrombosis, or if the platelet count falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific blood tests.|$|E

Two ribs and a belly-rib showed signs of breaking and healing. One adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks. The low number of abnormalities compares favourably with the health condition of a Majungasaurus population of which it in 2007 was established that 19% of individuals showed bone pathologies.|$|E
5|$|A {{white dwarf}} star may {{accumulate}} sufficient material from a stellar companion to raise its core temperature enough to ignite carbon fusion, at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting it. There are three avenues by which this detonation is theorized to happen: stable accretion of material from a companion, the collision of two white dwarfs, or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites. The dominant mechanism by which Type Ia supernovae are produced remains unclear. Despite this uncertainty in how Type Ia supernovae are produced, Type Ia supernovae have very uniform properties, and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances. Some calibrations are required {{to compensate for the}} gradual change in properties or different frequencies <b>of</b> <b>abnormal</b> luminosity supernovae at high red shift, and for small variations in brightness identified by light curve shape or spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases <b>of</b> <b>abnormal</b> ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. The ear canal can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the ear canal, as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs {{of the rest of the}} ear.|$|E

5|$|Liver AVMs may be {{suspected}} because <b>of</b> <b>abnormal</b> {{liver function}} {{tests in the}} blood, because the symptoms of heart failure develop, or because of jaundice or other symptoms of liver dysfunction. The most reliable initial screening test is Doppler ultrasonography of the liver; this has a very high sensitivity for identifying vascular lesions in the liver. If necessary, contrast-enhanced CT {{may be used to}} further characterize AVMs. It is extremely common to find incidental nodules on liver scans, most commonly due to focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), as these are a hundredfold times more common in HHT compared to the general population. FNH is regarded as harmless. Generally, tumor markers and additional imaging modalities are used to differentiate between FNH and malignant tumors of the liver. Liver biopsy is discouraged in people with HHT as the risk of hemorrhage from liver AVMs may be significant. Liver scans may be useful if someone is suspected of HHT, but does not meet the criteria (see below) unless liver lesions can be demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} {{schizophrenia}} {{are not well}} understood, but numerous abnormalities of brain structure have been reported. The most thoroughly investigated alterations involve the cerebral cortex, but effects on the hippocampus have also been described. Many reports have found reductions {{in the size of}} the hippocampus in schizophrenic subjects. The left hippocampus seems to be affected more than the right. The changes noted have largely been accepted to be the result <b>of</b> <b>abnormal</b> development. It is unclear whether hippocampal alterations play any role in causing the psychotic symptoms that are the most important feature of schizophrenia. It has been suggested that on the basis of experimental work using animals, hippocampal dysfunction might produce an alteration of dopamine release in the basal ganglia, thereby indirectly affecting the integration of information in the prefrontal cortex. It has also been suggested that hippocampal dysfunction might account for the disturbances in long-term memory frequently observed.|$|E
5|$|The first clue to a {{diagnosis}} of AML is typically an abnormal result on a complete blood count.

5|$|Stratton saw humans not as {{machines}} {{to be analyzed}} mechanistically, but also as seating will, emotion and drives, all of which had to analyzed as scientifically as the traditional psychological concepts of sensation, perception and memory. He also believed in a supreme actuality behind the world registered by our senses. This was the theme of his last published book, Man-Creator or Destroyer, completed in 1952 when he was eighty-seven years old. His book Developing Mental Power was a foray into educational psychology, addressing the question of general versus specific training in terms teachers could understand and use. Stratton aimed at this goal via a simple and generally applicable look at the basic workings of mental life. John F. Dashiell, writing in the Journal <b>of</b> <b>Abnormal</b> Psychology, found this a failure. Dashiell saw the path from the psychological concepts—emotion, intelligence, and will—to teaching methodology, not clearly described in the book. Stratton also applied psychological concepts {{to figure out how}} to avert war. He was optimistic it was possible to harness the creative and destructive facets of individuals to get nations to coexist peacefully. He saw nations as consisting of ethnicities and races which had to coexist in harmony. In line with the prevailing view in his field, he did not see the races as inherently equally intelligent.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} {{produced by}} AVMs {{in the liver}} depend on the type <b>of</b> <b>abnormal</b> connection that they form between blood vessels. If the connection is between arteries and veins, {{a large amount of}} blood bypasses the body's organs, for which the heart compensates by increasing the cardiac output. Eventually congestive cardiac failure develops ("high-output cardiac failure"), with breathlessness and leg swelling among other problems. If the AVM creates a connection between the portal vein and the blood vessels of the liver, the result may be portal hypertension (increased portal vein pressure), in which collateral blood vessels form in the esophagus (esophageal varices), which may bleed violently; furthermore, the increased pressure may give rise to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity (ascites). If the flow in the AVM is in the other direction, portal venous blood flows directly into the veins rather than running through the liver; this may lead to hepatic encephalopathy (confusion due to portal waste products irritating the brain). Rarely, the bile ducts are deprived of blood, leading to severe cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Liver AVMs are detectable in over 70% of people with HHT, but only 10% experience problems as a result.|$|E
