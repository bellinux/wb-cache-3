The study points only to a very limited influence from northern Africa and the Middle East both in historic and prehistoric times. The absence of microsatellite variation suggests a very recent arrival from Morocco consistent with historical exchanges across the Mediterranean {{during the period of}} Islamic expansion, namely of Berber populations. A study restricted to Portugal, concerning Y-chromosome lineages, revealed that [...] "The mtDNA and Y data indicate that the Berber presence in that region dates prior to the Moorish expansion in 711 AD. ... <b>Our</b> <b>data</b> indicate that male Berbers, unlike sub-Saharan immigrants, constituted a long-lasting and continuous community in the country".|$|E
60|$|In {{almost all}} our {{previous}} discussions {{we have been}} concerned {{in the attempt to}} get clear as to <b>our</b> <b>data</b> in the way of knowledge of existence. What things are there in the universe whose existence is known to us owing to our being acquainted with them? So far, our answer has been that we are acquainted with our sense-data, and, probably, with ourselves. These we know to exist. And past sense-data which are remembered are known to have existed in the past. This knowledge supplies <b>our</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E

60|$|In any science {{other than}} {{psychology}} the datum {{is primarily a}} perception, in which only the sensational core is ultimately and theoretically a datum, though some such accretions as turn the sensation into a perception are practically unavoidable. But if we postulate an ideal observer, {{he will be able}} to isolate the sensation, and treat this alone as datum. There is, therefore, an important sense in which we may say that, if we analyse as much as we ought, <b>our</b> <b>data,</b> outside psychology, consist of sensations, which include within themselves certain spatial and temporal relations.|$|E

It is, however, a psychologically derivative belief, since it results from observation of people's bodies; and along with other such beliefs, it does not belong to the hardest of hard data, but becomes, under the influence of philosophic reflection, just sufficiently questionable to make us desire some argument connecting it with the facts of sense.|$|E
