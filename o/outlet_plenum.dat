40|$|The Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) system {{behavior}} {{should be}} predicted during normal operating conditions and during transient conditions. To predict the VHTR system behavior {{there is an}} urgent need for development, testing and validation of design tools to demonstrate the feasibility of the design concepts and guide {{the improvement of the}} plant components. One of the identified design issues for the gas-cooled reactor is the thermal mixing of the coolant exiting the core into the <b>outlet</b> <b>plenum.</b> Incomplete thermal mixing may give rise to thermal stresses in the downstream components. This analysis was performed by coupling a RELAP 5 - 3 D???? VHTR model to a Fluent <b>outlet</b> <b>plenum</b> model. The RELAP 5 VHTR model outlet conditions provide the inlet boundary conditions to the Fluent <b>outlet</b> <b>plenum</b> model. By coupling the two codes in this manner, the important three-dimensional flow effects in the <b>outlet</b> <b>plenum</b> are well modeled without having to model the entire reactor with a computationally expensive code such as Fluent. The two codes were successfully coupled. The values of pressure, mass flow rate and temperature across the coupled boundary showed only slight differences. The coupling tool used in this analysis can be applied to many different cases requiring detailed three-dimensional modeling in {{a small portion of the}} domain...|$|E
40|$|One {{advanced}} {{nuclear reactor}} design has a residual heat removal (RHR) pipe {{connected to the}} bottom of a steam generator <b>outlet</b> <b>plenum.</b> The water in the plenum can become thermally stratified during postulated loss of coolant accidents. Cold water injected through the RHR pipe has the potential effect of increasing the steam condensation on the pool surface due to the stirring action of the jet. The amount of increase depends on a number of factors, including the jet velocity and the pool height above the jet injection point. Prediction of steam condensation rates, before and after the jet breaks the pool surface, is the topic of this paper. Data and correlations exist for pre surface breakthrough and a method has been developed for post breakthrough. The models have been incorporated into the reactor safety analysis computer software known as RELAP 5. Comparisons of predictions against data are presented...|$|E

The planform area is 5. 0 x 1. 53 cm(2). Tests were performed with water and methanol as working fluids with mass fluxes of 20 - 1200 kg/m(2) s, Inlet temperatures of 30, 50 and 70 degreesC and effective heating powers of 100 - 450 W.

Fine bubbles were detected close to the channel exit, and they were moving out of the channel to form a unit circular bubble in the <b>outlet</b> <b>plenum.</b> Once the mass flux is lower than that of OFI, three types of oscillations were identified: large amplitude/long period oscillation superimposed with small amplitude/short period oscillation and small amplitude/short period oscillation.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to investigate the distribution of oil pressure within a squeeze film damper. The damper was made so that its operation {{turned out to be}} as simple as possible, in order to highlight the main causes of practical deviation from theoretical prediction, with particular reference to cavitating mechanisms and regardless of inertia effects. The journal of the damper was given an eccentric orbital precession, with adoption of two distinct values of the offset. A groove placed laterally to the film secured the oil feeding. An <b>outlet</b> <b>plenum</b> at {{the opposite side of the}} film was operated with two different levels of exposure to the ambient air. Observation of the oil pressure was restricted to the film section midway between the inlet and outlet border, by means of three piezoelectric transducers plus a strain gage sensor. Theoretical prediction with a simple isoviscous short bearing uncavitated model was shown to be a significant reference for the experimental data. Analysis of the pressure levels and shape of the pressure waves made it possible to recognize operating conditions with the presence of tensile stresses and rupture of the film. The latter conditions were chiefly due to vapour cavitation. Spikes with tensile strength preceded in many circumstances the ruptured region. Air entrainment and its effects proved to be restricted at high frequency regimes with very low supply pressures and coexisted with vapour cavitation. The influence of moderate orbital distortion on pressure signals was highlighted. Significant differences in the pressure behaviour from one sensor location to the other, for the same operating conditions, were frequently observed...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the effects of channel surface wettability and temperature gradients on the boiling flow pattern in a single microchannel.

The flow pattern consists of a fluid triangle (shrinkage of the liquid films) and a connected long liquid rivulet, which is generated in the central microchannel in the timescale of milliseconds. The peculiar flow pattern is formed due to the following reasons: (1) the liquid rivulet tends to have a large contact area with the top hydrophilic channel surface of the glass cover, but a smaller contact area with the bottom silicon hydrophobic surface. (2) The temperature gradient in the chip width direction at the top channel surface of the glass cover not only causes the shrinkage of the liquid films in the central microchannel upstream, but also attracts the liquid rivulet populated near the microchannel centerline. (3) The zigzag pattern is formed due to the competition between the evaporation momentum forces at the vapor-liquid interfaces and the force due to the Marangoni effect. The former causes the rivulet to deviate from the channel centerline and the latter draws the rivulet toward the channel centerline. (4) The temperature gradient along the flow direction in the central microchannel downstream causes the breakup of the rivulet to form isolated droplets there.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{develops}} a static observer for estimating wind speed {{in order to}} control wind speed and angle control at a user position in a submersive virtual environment. Addition of wind display evolves the Treadport Virtual environment into a highly immersive virtual environment called Treadport Active Wind Tunnel (TPAWT). Experiments on a scaled model of the TPAWT show that headwind flow stream diverges at the user. Pitot tube sensors placed at a particular region of converged flow in the scaled TPAWT provide measurements with lower noise. Open loop experiments on a scaled model of TPAWT show that there exists a relationship between speed measured at this region of converged flow and the wind speed at the user position. Using this relationship, the wind speed at the user can be estimated. We use this relation and combine previously used speed and angle controllers based upon the small gain theorem with a dynamic extension and conditional angular rate-switching control. Finally, we simultaneously control wind speed and headwind angle. towards the user. In [4], a return plenum shown in Fig. 2, is augmented to the scaled model to stabilize wind flow and allow input-output control of wind angle using a version of Small Gain Theorem (SGT) [6] and dynamic extension in combination with a conditional angular rate switching control. This paper contributes in developing a static observer to estimate the speed at the user, by measuring speed at the return plenum. We incorporate the static observer in the speed controller developed in [3], combine it with the headwind angle controller from [4] and achieve simultaneous wind speed and headwind angle control at the user. From [4] and Fig. 2, observe that the headwind flow diverges at the user. There is a high variance in the speed measurement when flow diverges.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Advances in {{electronics}} fabrication, {{coupled with}} the demand for increased computing power, have driven the demand for innovative cooling solutions to dissipate waste heat generated by these devices. To meet future demands, research and development has focused on robust and stable two-phase heat transfer devices. A confined impinging jet is explored as means of utilizing two-phase heat transfer while minimizing flow instabilities observed in microchannel devices. The test configuration consists of a 4 mm diameter jet of water that impinges on a 38 mm diameter heated aluminum surface. Experimental parameters include inlet mass flow rates from 150 to 600 g/min, nozzle-to-surface spacing from 1 to 8 mm, and input heat fluxes from 0 to 90 W/cm 2. Results {{were used to assess}} the influence of the testing parameters on the heat transfer performance and stability characteristics of a two-phase confined impinging jet. Stability characteristics were explored using power spectral densities (PSDs) of the inlet pressure time series data. Confined impinging jets, over the range of conditions tested, were found to be stable and an efficient means of removing large amounts of waste heat. The radial geometry of the confined jet allows the fluid to expand as it flows radially away from the nozzle, which suppresses instabilities found in microchannel array geometries. Conditions of the heater surface were found to strongly influence two-phase performance. Analysis of PSDs, for stable operation, showed dominate frequencies in the range of 1 - 4 Hz, which were attributed to generated vapor expanding in the <b>outlet</b> <b>plenum</b> and the subsequent collapse as it condensed.

Graduate List, Jun. 4, 1990 : Transient thermal-hydraulic {{analysis}} of a packed particle bed reactor fuel elementA model which describes the thermal-hydraulic behavior of a packed particle bed reactor fuel element is developed and compared to a reference standard. The model represents a step toward a thermal-hydraulic module for a real-time, autonomous reactor powder controller. The general configuration of the fuel element is a bed of small (diameter about 500 microns) fuel particles are packed between concentrically mounted retention cylinders referred to as frits. The momentum integral approach used in the MINET code is applied ot this model to balance the fundamental mass, energy and momentum conservation relationships. The element is divided into only three control volumes: the inlet plenum and cold frit define the first control volume, the fuel particle bed defines a second control volume, and the <b>outlet</b> <b>plenum</b> and hot frit define the third control volume. The solid phase of the particle bed is represented by a single node. This simple model was validated against the reference standard and compared favorably.

Assessment of the ability of thermal hydraulic codes to correctly predict complex phenomena during reactor transients can be performed only by means of comparison against experimental data. The thermal hydraulic CATHARE V 1. 3 U computer program has been used to simulate International Standard Problem (ISP 38) experiment conducted at BETHSY Integral Test Facility located in Grenoble, France. BETHSY is an integral test facility modeling the three-loop, 2775 thermal NM Framatome Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). Its main objectives are to contribute to the assessment of CATHARE code and of the physical basis of PWR Emergency Operating Procedures. This investigation dealt with experimental simulation of the loss of the Residual Heat Removal System (RHRS) during midloop operation. It involved opening of the pressurizer manway and the steam generator <b>outlet</b> <b>plenum</b> manway simultaneously with switching on the power of heating rods, thus simulating loss of the RHRS. The total power was kept unchanged with the level 138 kW throughout the test. Mass discharge through both manways led to core boiling and uncovery. A gravity feed injection of cold water was actuated in the cold leg when cladding temperature at the top of heating rods reached 250 C. The test was stopped when the primary cooling system was filled back to rnidloop level. The transient was executed on the HP 6400 workstation at Texas A&M University. The code predictions underestimated the time of the core uncovery and the actuation of the gravity feed injection due to the ovepredicted mass discharge through steain generator manway during the initial stage of the transient. This was probably caused by CATHARE's miscalculation of the phase separation effect at the hot leg/surge line tee junction and significant water entrainment into the surge line {{in the beginning of the}} test. It was found that the model of the upward tee junction needs to be refined for the low pressure range.

40|$|An {{innovative}} hybrid loop-pool {{design for}} sodium cooled fast reactors (SFR-Hybrid) has been recently proposed. This design {{takes advantage of}} the inherent safety of a pool design and the compactness of a loop design to improve economics and safety of SFRs. In the hybrid loop-pool design, primary loops are formed by connecting the reactor <b>outlet</b> <b>plenum</b> (hot pool), intermediate heat exchangers (IHX), primary pumps and the reactor inlet plenum with pipes. The primary loops are immersed in the cold pool (buffer pool). Passive safety systems [...] modular Pool Reactor Auxiliary Cooling Systems (PRACS) – are added to transfer decay heat from the primary system to the buffer pool during loss of forced circulation (LOFC) transients. The primary systems and the buffer pool are thermally coupled by the PRACS, which is composed of PRACS heat exchangers (PHX), fluidic diodes and connecting pipes. Fluidic diodes are simple, passive devices that provide large flow resistance in one direction and small flow resistance in reverse direction. Direct reactor auxiliary cooling system (DRACS) heat exchangers (DHX) are immersed in the cold pool to transfer decay heat to the environment by natural circulation. To prove the design concepts, especially how the passive safety systems behave during transients such as LOFC with scram, a RELAP 5 - 3 D model for the hybrid loop-pool design was developed. The simulations were done for both steady-state and transient conditions. This paper presents the details of RELAP 5 - 3 D analysis as well as the calculated thermal response during LOFC with scram. The 250 MW thermal power conventional pool type design of GNEP’s Advanced Burner Test Reactor (ABTR) developed by Argonne National Laboratory was used as the reference reactor core and primary loop design. The reactor inlet temperature is 355 °C and the outlet temperature is 510 °C. The core design is the same as that for ABTR. The steady state buffer pool temperature {{is the same as the}} reactor inlet temperature. The peak cladding, hot pool, cold pool and reactor inlet temperatures were calculated during LOFC. The results indicate that there are two phases during LOFC transient – the initial thermal equilibration phase and the long term decay heat removal phase. The initial thermal equilibration phase occurs over a few hundred seconds, as the system adjusts from forced circulation to natural circulation flow. Subsequently, during long-term heat removal phase all temperatures evolve very slowly due to the large thermal inertia of the primary and buffer pool systems. The results clearly show that passive safety PRACS can effectively transfer decay heat from the primary system to the buffer pool by natural circulation. The DRACS system in turn can effectively transfer the decay heat to the environment...|$|E
