50|$|In many cases, the {{baud rate}} of the <b>optical</b> <b>interface</b> does not equal {{the baud rate}} of the {{electrical}} interface. In these cases, a gearbox is used within the module to convert between the two rates. For example if the module supports 4 x 25 Gb/s electrical inputs and 2 wavelengths of 50 Gb/s <b>optical</b> <b>interface,</b> then a gearbox must convert between 25 and 50 GBaud.|$|E
50|$|A {{parallel}} <b>optical</b> <b>interface</b> {{is a form}} {{of fiber}} optic technology aimed primarily at communications and networking over relatively short distances (less than 300 meters), and at high bandwidths.|$|E

25|$|This {{is often}} done {{by use of}} optical-to-electrical-to-optical (O/E/O) {{translation}} at {{the very edge of}} the transport network, thus permitting interoperation with existing equipment with <b>optical</b> <b>interfaces.</b>|$|R
50|$|The main {{applications}} for parallel <b>optical</b> <b>interfaces</b> {{are found in}} telecommunications and supercomputers, also being introduced to consumer applications. It displaces copper backplanes that are commonly used for large switching equipment design.|$|R
50|$|The Fibre Channel {{electrical}} interface {{is one of}} two related standards {{that can be used to}} physically interconnect computer devices. The other standard is a Fibre Channel <b>optical</b> <b>interface,</b> which is not covered in this article.|$|E
50|$|As VLAN {{support was}} {{really needed to}} offer {{reliable}} services to the users of a cable modem network, the next version of the network controller was a single ATM interface offering an OC3 or STM-1 - 155 Mbit/s <b>optical</b> <b>interface.</b> In most configurations, a ComController used a single ATM network controller.|$|E
50|$|Originally, both {{electrical}} and optical interfaces were defined by SMPTE, over concerns that an electrical interface at that bitrate would be expensive or unreliable, {{and that an}} <b>optical</b> <b>interface</b> would be necessary. Such fears have not been realized, and the optical interfaces are seldom if ever used, {{and are likely to}} be deprecated in future revisions of the standard.|$|E
50|$|The Colition for On-Board Optics (COBO) was {{established}} in 2014 to provide {{a home for the}} standardization of <b>optical</b> <b>interfaces</b> that were located on the middle of boards rather than on the front panel.|$|R

50|$|Lightpipe {{uses the}} same {{connection}} hardware as S/PDIF: fiber optic cables (hence its name) to carry data, with Toslink connectors and optical transceivers at either end. However, the data streams of the two protocols are totally incompatible. S/PDIF is mostly used for transferring stereo or multi-channel surround sound audio, whereas the ADAT <b>optical</b> <b>interface</b> supports up to 8 channels at 48 kHz, 24 bit. Lightpipe devices have been successfully interfaced via FireWire.|$|E
5000|$|The ADAT Lightpipe, officially the ADAT <b>Optical</b> <b>Interface,</b> is a {{standard}} for the transfer of digital audio between equipment. It was originally developed by Alesis but has since become widely accepted, with many third party hardware manufacturers including Lightpipe interfaces on their equipment. The protocol has become so popular that the term [...] "ADAT" [...] is now often {{used to refer to}} the transfer standard rather than to the Alesis Digital Audio Tape itself.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to developing new applications, Kurenniemi studied {{the use of}} different control systems in his instruments. For instance, Dimi-O (1971) {{is based on an}} <b>optical</b> <b>interface,</b> the original purpose of which was to read sheet music graphically. The instrument could also be played with a conventional keyboard or via a video camera. Dimi-O was also used in tandem with a dancer, whose movements were transformed into music (see Section 2.2 Film, media and video works).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{accurate}} and computationally efficient system-level optical propagation technique {{suitable for the}} modeling of <b>optical</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Our technique is based on extensions to the angular spectrum technique used to solve the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld formulation. By using a FFT, the angular spectrum technique is efficient and suitable for system-level modeling of the complete system. To support the reflection and transmission at <b>optical</b> <b>interfaces,</b> we implement a semi-vector technique, {{taking into account the}} polarization of the optical wavefront. The polarization is used to determine the reflection and transmission coefficients through the use of Berreman’s 4 x 4 matrix. Solutions are provided for typical TE and TM waves, however, wavefronts with arbitrary linear polarization are also supported. In this paper, we present a system-level simulation of a Silicon on Sapphire (SOS) interface...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} CFP specification {{was proposed}} {{at a time}} when 10 Gbit/s signals were far more achievable than 25 Gbit/s signals. As such to achieve 100 Gbit/s line rate, the most affordable solution was based on 10 lanes of 10 Gbit/s. However, as expected, improvements in technology have allowed higher performance and higher density. Hence the development of the CFP2 and CFP4 specifications. While electrically similar, they specify a form-factor of 1/2 and 1/4 respectively in size of the original specification. Note that CFP, CFP2 and CFP4 modules are not interchangeable (but are inter-operable at the <b>optical</b> <b>interface</b> with appropriate connectors).|$|E
50|$|In some designs, a shear gas, {{typically}} nitrogen or dry {{compressed air}} {{is used to}} 'cut' the plasma at a specific spot. One or two transfer lenses are then used to focus the emitted light on a diffraction grating where it is separated into its component wavelengths in the optical spectrometer. In other designs, the plasma impinges directly upon an <b>optical</b> <b>interface</b> which consists of an orifice from which a constant flow of argon emerges, deflecting the plasma and providing cooling while allowing the emitted light from the plasma to enter the optical chamber. Still other designs use optical fibers to convey some of the light to separate optical chambers.|$|E
50|$|RRHs {{have become}} one of the most {{important}} subsystems of today's new distributed base stations. The RRH contains the base station's RF circuitry plus analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converters and up/down converters. RRHs also have operation and management processing capabilities and a standardized <b>optical</b> <b>interface</b> to connect to the rest of the base station. This will be increasingly true as LTE and WiMAX are deployed. Remote radio heads make MIMO operation easier; they increase a base station's efficiency and facilitate easier physical location for gap coverage problems. RRHs will use the latest RF component technology including Gallium nitride (GaN) RF power devices and envelope tracking technology within the RRH RF power amplifier (RFPA).|$|E
5000|$|The SCSI {{standard}} {{provides an}} extensible semantic abstraction for computer data storage devices, {{and as such}} has become a [...] "lingua franca" [...] for data storage systems.

30|$|Currently, the CQuCoM {{proposal}} {{calls for}} two sequential missions. It is possible, however, {{to consider the}} possibility of combining both missions into a single spacecraft. This will require the spacecraft to be able to supply more resources. For one, an increased volume for accommodating both types of light sources must be available. It also makes the <b>optical</b> <b>interfaces</b> more challenging.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{demonstrate}} experimentally that topological defects of vertically aligned nematic {{liquid crystal}} films induced by electric fields {{can be used}} as highly efficient natural optical spin-orbit encoders that do not need machining techniques.

5000|$|Optical sensors {{are used}} for point level sensing of sediments, liquids with {{suspended}} solids, and liquid-liquid interfaces. These sensors sense the decrease or change in transmission of infrared light emitted from an infrared diode (LED). With the proper choice of construction materials and mounting location, these sensors {{can be used with}} aqueous, organic, and corrosive liquids. [...] A common application of economical infrared-based <b>optical</b> <b>interface</b> point level sensors is detecting the sludge/water interface in settling ponds. By using pulse modulation techniques and a high power infrared diode, one can eliminate interference from ambient light, operate the LED at a higher gain, and lessen the effects of build-up on the probe.|$|E
5000|$|Professional soundcards {{are usually}} {{described}} as [...] "audio interfaces", and sometimes have {{the form of}} external rack-mountable units using USB, FireWire, or an <b>optical</b> <b>interface,</b> to offer sufficient data rates. The emphasis in these products is, in general, on multiple input and output connectors, direct hardware support for multiple input and output sound channels, as well as higher sampling rates and fidelity {{as compared to the}} usual consumer soundcard. In that respect, their role and intended purpose is more similar to a specialized multi-channel data recorder and real-time audio mixer and processor, roles which are possible only to a limited degree with typical consumer soundcards.|$|E
50|$|Optical module {{refers to}} a {{typically}} hot-pluggable optical transceiver used in high-bandwidth data communications applications. Optical modules typically have an electrical interface on the side that connects {{to the inside of}} the system and an <b>optical</b> <b>interface</b> on the side that connects to the outside world through a fiber optic cable. The form factor and electrical interface are often specified by an interested group using a multi-source agreement (MSA). Optical modules can either plug into a front panel socket or an on-board socket. Sometimes the optical module is replaced by an electrical interface module that implements either an active or passive electrical connection to the outside world. A large industry supports the manufacturing and use of optical modules.|$|E
40|$|In {{the digital}} X-ray imaging systems, {{one of the}} main {{problems}} to be solved is the efficiency of the <b>optical</b> <b>interfaces</b> between scintillators and photodetectors. This article presents the theoretical analysis, simulations, and experimental results on two different <b>optical</b> <b>interfaces</b> (SiO 2 and Si 3 N 4), in order to maximize the X-ray detection efficiency. The working principle is the following: the X-ray photons reach the scintillator, which produces visible light. The visible light is then absorbed by the CMOS photodetector. Due {{to the fact that the}} refractive indexes of the scintillator and the photodetector are different, the visible light produced by the scintillator is partially reflected by the surface of the photodetector. In order to minimize this problem it is necessary to cover the photodetector with an anti-reflective filter. The anti-reflective filters were fabricated using two different dielectric layers available in a standard CMOS process, with no increase of the production time and costs of the device...|$|R
