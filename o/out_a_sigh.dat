60|$|She {{spoke softly}} to him, and {{he rose to}} his feet, putting his arm round her in quiet {{consciousness}} of his ownership; she laid {{her head on his}} shoulder with a sense of defiance to all the world in the encircling protection of that arm. He was hers with all his qualities and all his faults. His strength and his courage, his recklessness and his daring, his simple wisdom and his savage cunning--all were hers. As they passed together out of the red light of the fire into the silver shower of rays that fell upon the clearing he bent his head over her face, and she saw in his eyes the dreamy intoxication of boundless felicity from the close touch of her slight figure clasped to his side. With a rhythmical swing of their bodies they walked through the light towards the outlying shadows of the forests that seemed to guard their happiness in solemn immobility. Their forms melted in the play of light and shadow {{at the foot of the}} big trees, but the murmur of tender words lingered over the empty clearing, grew faint, and died <b>out.</b> <b>A</b> <b>sigh</b> as of immense sorrow passed over the land in the last effort of the dying breeze, and in the deep silence which succeeded, the earth and the heavens were suddenly hushed up in the mournful contemplation of human love and human blindness.|$|E

60|$|An hour, perhaps, she sat {{upright in}} bed, {{considering}} {{what she should}} do. Then again she reached out in the darkness and felt for her scissors. Securing them, she drew the chair cushion upon the bed and felt along its edge for the place she had sewn. She could not determine for some time which was the right edge but at last she found where the stitches seemed a little tighter drawn than elsewhere and this place she managed to rip open. To her joy she found the letter and drew it <b>out</b> with <b>a</b> <b>sigh</b> of relief.|$|R

Sometimes, instead of reading to them, he would set them to declaiming or reciting poetry, or they would choose sides and have a spelling match.

Lingard turned away and threw himself back in his chair, stretching his legs <b>out</b> with <b>a</b> <b>sigh</b> of fatigue. His head fell forward; and under his red face the white beard lay fan-like on his breast, the ends of fine long hairs all astir in the faint draught made by the rapid motion of the craft that carried him away from his prisoner--from the only thing in his life he wished to hide.|$|R

Vulturo is grateful, and Speedy suggests that since Vulturo can't and probably won't catch him, Speedy knows one, fat, juicy mouse that would be perfect for Vulturo and will show him where that mouse lives.

40|$|The legal {{community}} of the Netherlands let <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>sigh</b> of relief in May 2011 when {{the judgment of the}} District Court of The Hague in preliminary proceedings was handed down in the Darfurnica case. The same feeling of satisfaction prevailed, more recently, when the Court of Appeal of Amsterdam rendered decision in the Miffy case. Both decisions, rendered on appeal, overruled the judgments of first instance, which had given precedence to the protection of intellectual property rights above the user’s freedom of expression in the form of parody. But freedom of expression, and parody in particular, are solidly anchored in the Dutch values and courts more often than not find in favour of the parodist. Apart from the fact that both decisions offer an interesting analysis of where the limit lies between intellectual property protection and artistic freedom, each decision deserves a few words of commentary in view of some noteworthy particularities...|$|E
40|$|More {{than two}} years have elapsed since {{employers}} let <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>sigh</b> of relief when the Supreme Court overturned the 9 th Circuit decision in Wal-Mart v. Dukes and decertified the class of plaintiffs suing Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest employer, for sex discrimination. 1 The class consisted of approximately 1. 5 million of the retailer’s former and current female employees. 2 While {{the details of the}} lower and Supreme Court decisions are {{beyond the scope of this}} paper, the lesson for many employers was the fear that class actions, regardless of merit, could put an entire company at risk. While the obvious response, “don’t violate the law,” should seemingly resolve that fear, the fact is that many employment lawsuits, such as wage and hour or discrimination cases, are often difficult to defend. This may occur because: (1) the law is unclear; (2) there are shades of gray in employment decisions, (3) it is difficult to ensure compliance in large multistate or multi-national corporations, or (4) sometimes companies face “bad facts” even when they did not violate the law. Although defending the allegations of one employee or even a group is expensive, most employers are able to do this. Defending a class action, however, often requires resources beyond what many employers can marshal. In this paper, we propose a way to avoid such costly litigation: arbitration...|$|E

Sarah explained that she tried to join basketball and attended the first team meeting where the players were issued uniforms. She said, “I looked in the bin at all the shirts and I couldn’t find my size so I like didn’t end up doing the sport”. When asked if it made her sad she let <b>out</b> <b>a</b> big <b>sigh</b> and said, “Yeah, cause I wanted to play”. Imani wanted to join volleyball, but explained that she knew the largest uniform size available would be a kid’s medium, and she wore adult sizes. This knowledge made her too uncomfortable to play.

Ta’i'i was punished {{and was forced to}} climb the coconut tree feet first. As he was {{climbing}} the coconut tree, he let <b>out</b> <b>a</b> huge <b>sigh</b> because the climb was difficult. Ta'i'i's sighs were overheard by Saveasi'uleo and Nafanua. This made Savesi’uleo angry; consequently he told Nafanua to prepare for war and to cut down the Toa tree. The wood from the tree was to be used to make weapons to drive away the High Chief Lilomaiava and his army. Immediately Nafanua cut down the Toa tree and left it there to dry. A few days later, {{she went back to the}} area where the Toa tree was cut and discovered that the tree attracted lots of Pule (seashells). [...] "E gase toa ae ola pule". Literally this means that the shells are living but the Toa tree is dead.
