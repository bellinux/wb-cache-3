25|$|Several {{track and}} field movies have used Eugene as a setting and/or a filming location. Personal Best, {{starring}} Mariel Hemingway, was filmed in Eugene in 1982. The film centered on a group <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> trying {{to qualify for the}} Olympic {{track and field}} team. Two track and field movies about the life of Steve Prefontaine, Prefontaine and Without Limits were released within a year of each other in 1997–1998. Kenny Moore, Eugene-trained Olympic runner and co-star in Prefontaine, co-wrote the screenplay for Without Limits. Prefontaine was filmed in Washington because the Without Limits production bought out Hayward Field for the summer to prevent its competition from shooting there. Kenny Moore also wrote a biography of Bill Bowerman, played in Without Limits by Donald Sutherland back in Eugene 20 years after he had appeared in Animal House. Moore had also had a role in Personal Best.|$|E

She faced discouraging comments on her choice of study throughout her life, but persevered, supported by family and colleagues. In addition to astronomy, Rubin was a force for greater recognition of women in the sciences and for scientific literacy.

500|$|Both {{these types}} of reading have now fallen out of favour; there is little {{consensus}} {{about the meaning of}} The Country Wife, but its [...] "notorious resistance to interpretation" [...] is having an invigorating rather than damping effect on academic interest. The play's ideological dimension has been emphasised recently. It was written by a courtier for a courtly and aristocratic audience, and Douglas Canfield has pointed to an unusual complication for a courtly play. Horner's acts of cuckolding aggression are directed not only at disrupting middle-class families of [...] "the City", in the usual way of the aristocratic Restoration rake, but also at his own, upper, class, the inhabitants of [...] "the Town" [...] the new and fashionable quarters (the future West End) that had sprung up west of the medieval City walls after the Great Fire of London in 1666. The courtier code proposed by Wycherley is of a sexual game. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick argued in Between Men that the game is played not between men and women, but between men by means <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> merely the [...] "conduits" [...] of homosocial desire between men. The hierarchy of wits meant that the wittiest and most virile man would win at the game. Thus Horner, as Canfield puts it, [...] "represents not just class superiority, but that subset of class represented by the Town wits, a privileged minority that ... is the jet set identified with the Town and the Court as the loci of real power in the kingdom." [...] The aggressive attack mounted in the china scene against the class and the generation by which Wycherley was patronised with the expectation that he would defend it (against Sir Jaspar Fidget and Lady Fidget), suggests Canfield, would only let an audience of that class laugh comfortably if Horner were punished by actual impotence in the end, which he is not. [...] "When the play concludes with no poetical justice that makes Horner really impotent", writes Canfield, [...] "leaving him instead potent and still on the make, the audience laughs at its own expense: the women of quality nervously because they have been misogynistically slandered; the men of quality nervously because at some level they recognize that class solidarity is just a pleasing fiction." ...|$|E
