5|$|Servicing Mission 3A, {{flown by}} Discovery, {{took place in}} December 1999, and was a {{split-off}} from Servicing Mission 3 after three of the six onboard gyroscopes had failed. The fourth failed {{a few weeks before}} the mission, rendering the telescope incapable of performing scientific observations. The mission replaced all six gyroscopes, replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor and the computer, installed a Voltage/temperature Improvement Kit (VIK) to prevent battery <b>overcharging,</b> and replaced thermal insulation blankets. The new computer is 20 times faster, with six times more memory, than the DF-224 it replaced. It increases throughput by moving some computing tasks from the ground to the spacecraft and saves money by allowing the use of modern programming languages.|$|E

40|$|Using 406 <b>overcharge</b> estimates, {{the study}} {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} cartel characteristics and the market environment on the magnitude of <b>overcharges</b> attained by cartels in different geographic markets and during six antitrust law regimes starting from the 18 th century. The median <b>overcharge</b> achieved by cartels is 20 percent of selling price. As predicted by cartel theory, market structure is an important determinant of the <b>overcharge</b> level. Markets where cartels have high market shares tend to have higher <b>overcharges.</b> The number of cartel participants and the size inequality among them are inversely related to the <b>overcharge</b> level. International cartels impose higher <b>overcharges</b> than domestic cartels. <b>Overcharges</b> attained in the US and European markets tend to be lower than <b>overcharges</b> achieved in the Asian markets {{and the rest of}} the world. Results on the impact of changes in the antitrust law environment over time on the size of cartel <b>overcharges</b> are mixed. However, there is some evidence indicating that the lowest <b>overcharges</b> are associated with the latest antitrust law period. Antitrust Cartels Collusion <b>Overcharges...</b>|$|R

40|$|Using <b>overcharge</b> {{estimates}} for 395 cartel episodes from the 18 th to the 21 st century, we evaluate {{the impact of}} cartel characteristics {{on the size of}} <b>overcharges</b> imposed by cartels across several geographic regions and antitrust law regimes. The results of our study have important policy implications. We find that the average <b>overcharge</b> imposed by cartels in our sample is 19 percent with the median of 16 percent of the selling price. Food industry cartels achieve lower <b>overcharges</b> than domestic cartels. Longer cartel episodes generate higher levels of <b>overcharges.</b> Cartels that were found or pled guilty achieve approximately the same levels of <b>overcharges</b> as legal cartels.

40|$|The <b>overcharge</b> {{condition}} in secondary lithium batteries employing redox additives for <b>overcharge</b> protection has been theoretically analyzed {{in terms of}} a finite linear diffusion model. The analysis leads to expressions relating the steady-state <b>overcharge</b> current density and cell voltage to the concentration, diffusion coefficient, standard reduction potential of the redox couple, and interelectrode distance. The model permits the estimation of the maximum permissible <b>overcharge</b> rate for any chosen set of system conditions. The model has been experimentally verified using 1, 1 -prime-dimethylferrocene as a redox additive. The theoretical results may be exploited in the design and optimization of <b>overcharge</b> protection by the redox additive approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{estimation}} of cartel <b>overcharges</b> {{lies at the}} heart of antitrust policy on cartel prosecution as it constitutes a key element in the determination of fines. Connor and Lande (2008) conducted a survey of cartels and found a mean <b>overcharge</b> estimate in the range of 31 % to 49 %. By examining more sources, Connor (2010) finds a mean of 50. 4 % for successful cartels. However, the data used in those studies are estimates obtained from different methodologies, sources and contexts rather than by direct observations. Therefore, these data are subject to model error, estimation error and publication bias. A quick examination of the Connor database reveals that the universe of <b>overcharge</b> estimate is asymmetric, heterogenous and contains a number of influential observations. Beside the fact that <b>overcharge</b> estimate are potentially biased, fitting a linear regression model to the data without providing a carefull treatment of the problems raised above may produce distorted results. We conduct a meta-analysis of cartel <b>overcharge</b> estimate in the spirit of Connor and Bolotova (2006) while providing a sound treatment of these matters. We find a bias-corrected mean and median <b>overcharge</b> estimate of 15. 76 % and 16. 43 %. Clearly, our results have significant antitrust policy implications...|$|R

25|$|When {{a battery}} is {{recharged}} at an excessive rate, an explosive gas mixture of {{hydrogen and oxygen}} may be produced faster than it can escape from within the battery (e.g. through a built-in vent), leading to pressure build-up and eventual bursting of the battery case.

40|$|Based on unique data characterizing private cartel {{behavior}} {{since the}} 1770 s, this dissertation presents an empirical analysis of four measures of success of overt collusive conduct: <b>overcharges,</b> stability, duration, and a multidimensional index of cartel success. Factors hypothesized {{to contribute to}} success include market structure, internal organization, and legal environment. The results of this research make important contributions to cartel studies and the design of antitrust policies. ^ Empirical findings suggest that markets characterized by {{a high degree of}} seller concentration provide a more favorable environment for cartel success than less concentrated markets. <b>Overcharges</b> attained in concentrated markets are higher, and cartels are more stable. The firms 2 ̆ 7 size inequality within the cartel is negatively related to cartel success. ^ There is mixed evidence about the impact of changes in the antirust law environment on cartel success. First, antitrust enforcement appears to be directed at cartels that attain lower <b>overcharges</b> rather than cartels that achieve higher <b>overcharges.</b> Second, stricter antitrust regulations tend to target cartel <b>overcharges</b> to a higher extent than they target cartel duration. Although cartel <b>overcharges</b> tend to decline over time, the duration of cartel agreements tends to increase over time. The multidimensional index of cartel success tends to increase over time, suggesting that cartels have become more successful as antitrust laws become stricter. However, there is also evidence that antitrust enforcement since 1990 has been the most effective. The <b>overcharges</b> are the lowest during this period. ^ This research shows that <b>overcharges</b> tend to be lower in the countries with the most mature antitrust systems. Empirical findings suggest that current antitrust policy presumptions about the average gain from price-fixing are likely to be too low. Therefore, fines calculated based on these presumptions typically result in sub-optimal deterrence. ...|$|R
