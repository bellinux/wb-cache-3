5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, {{removal of a}} lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the {{surgical}} treatment of choice. In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision (wedge resection) may be performed. However, wedge resection has a higher risk <b>of</b> <b>recurrence</b> than lobectomy. Radioactive iodine brachytherapy {{at the margins of}} wedge excision may reduce the risk <b>of</b> <b>recurrence.</b> Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery. VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.|$|E

5|$|Obesity {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as {{a risk factor for}} venous thrombosis. It more than doubles the risk in numerous studies, particularly in combination with the use of oral contraceptives or in the period after surgery. Various coagulation abnormalities have been described in the obese. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is present in higher levels in people with obesity. Obese people also have larger numbers of circulating microvesicles (fragments of damaged cells) that bear tissue factor. Platelet aggregation may be increased, and there are higher levels of coagulation proteins such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VII and factor VIII. Obesity also increases the risk <b>of</b> <b>recurrence</b> after an initial episode of thrombosis.|$|E

5|$|Children who {{discontinue}} {{the diet}} after achieving seizure freedom {{have about a}} 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable but averages two years. This risk <b>of</b> <b>recurrence</b> compares with 10% for resective surgery (where {{part of the brain}} is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those that have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with tuberous sclerosis). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and {{it has been suggested that}} children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 {{the first}} {{adequately}} large scale {{study on the}} natural history and long-term prognosis of this condition was reported; this showed that at 16 months follow-up 57.1% of patients had full recovery, 29.5%/2.9%/2.2% had respectively minor/moderate/severe symptoms or impairments, and 8.3% had died. Severe impairment or death were more likely in those aged over 37 years, male, affected by coma, mental status disorder, intracerebral hemorrhage, thrombosis of the deep cerebral venous system, central nervous system infection and cancer. A subsequent systematic review of nineteen studies in 2006 showed that mortality is about 5.6% during hospitalisation and 9.4% in total, while of the survivors 88% make a total or near-total recovery. After several months, {{two thirds of the}} cases has resolution ("recanalisation") of the clot. The rate <b>of</b> <b>recurrence</b> was low (2.8%).|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to endometrial carcinomas, the uncommon endometrial stromal sarcomas are cancers that {{originate in the}} non-glandular connective tissue of the endometrium. They are generally non-aggressive and, if they recur, can take decades. Metastases to the lungs and pelvic or peritoneal cavities are the most frequent. They typically have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. The prognosis for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is good, with 60–90% five-year survival. High-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma (HGUS) has a worse prognosis, with high rates <b>of</b> <b>recurrence</b> and 25% five-year survival. HGUS prognosis is dictated by {{whether or not the}} cancer has invaded the arteries and veins. Without vascular invasion, the five-year survival is 83%; it drops to 17% when vascular invasion is observed. Stage I ESS has the best prognosis, with five-year survival of 98% and ten-year survival of 89%. ESS makes up 0.2% of uterine cancers.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} site <b>of</b> <b>recurrence</b> {{is in the}} vagina; vaginal relapses of endometrial cancer have the best prognosis. If relapse occurs from a cancer {{that has not been}} treated with radiation, EBRT is the {{first-line}} treatment and is often successful. If a cancer treated with radiation recurs, pelvic exenteration is the only option for curative treatment. Palliative chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and radiation are also performed. Radiation therapy (VBT and EBRT) for a local vaginal recurrence has a 50% five-year survival rate. Pelvic recurrences are treated with surgery and radiation, and abdominal recurrences are treated with radiation and, if possible, chemotherapy. Other common recurrence sites are the pelvic lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes, peritoneum (28% of recurrences), and lungs, though recurrences can also occur in the brain (<1%), liver (7%), adrenal glands (1%), bones (4–7%; typically the axial skeleton), lymph nodes outside the abdomen (0.4–1%), spleen, and muscle/soft tissue (2–6%).|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} complication of proximal DVT is post-thrombotic syndrome, {{which is caused}} by a reduction in the return of venous blood to the heart. Some symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome are pain, edema, paresthesia, and in severe cases, leg ulcers. An estimated 20–50% of those with DVT will develop it, and 5–10% will develop the severe form. PE is the most serious complication of proximal DVT, and the risk of PE is higher when clots are present in the thigh and pelvis. Distal DVT itself is hardly if ever associated with post-thrombotic syndrome or PE. Untreated lower extremity DVT has a 3% PE-related mortality rate, while deaths associated with upper extremity DVT are extremely rare. The presence of a remaining thrombus after a DVT frequently occurs in a minority of people, and it increases the risk <b>of</b> <b>recurrence,</b> though to a lesser extent than an elevated D-dimer. In the 10 years following a DVT, approximately a third of individuals will have a recurrent episode.|$|E
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{follow-up}} examinations in cutaneous melanoma is to detect development of second melanomas or tumor recurrences in an early phase of development. Early detection <b>of</b> <b>recurrences</b> has prognostic impact for the patients. More than 80 % <b>of</b> all <b>recurrences</b> are primarily detected during follow-up examinations when a structured stage-adapted schedule is applied. In the majority <b>of</b> cases, <b>recurrences</b> are detected by physical examinations. Lymph node ultrasound enables early detection <b>of</b> locoregional <b>recurrences</b> before they become palpable and represents a sensitive examination method. Further imaging techniques in primary tumors are dispensable. In primary melanomas and particularly in those with a tumor thickness of less than 1 mm a reduction of the kind and frequency of technical examinations can be recommended according to recent publications. Hence the costs of follow-up examinations can be reduced clearly without increased risk for the patients. In stage III patients an intensified schedule including imaging techniques can help in increasing the early detection <b>of</b> <b>recurrences...</b>|$|R

5|$|There are {{two types}} of herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 more {{commonly}} causes infections around the mouth while HSV-2 more commonly causes genital infections. They are transmitted by direct contact with body fluids or lesions of an infected individual. Transmission may still occur when symptoms are not present. Genital herpes is classified as a sexually transmitted infection. It may be spread to an infant during childbirth. After infection, the viruses are transported along sensory nerves to the nerve cell bodies, where they reside lifelong. Causes <b>of</b> <b>recurrence</b> may include: decreased immune function, stress, and sunlight exposure. Oral and genital herpes is usually diagnosed based on the presenting symptoms. The diagnosis may be confirmed by viral culture or detecting herpes DNA in fluid from blisters. Testing the blood for antibodies against the virus can confirm a previous infection but will be negative in new infections.|$|E
