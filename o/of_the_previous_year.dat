5|$|Already 40 years old, Bacon {{viewed the}} {{exhibition}} as his last chance and applied {{himself to the}} task with determination.

5|$|Climate {{change may}} well affect populations of seabirds in the {{northern}} Atlantic. The most important demographic may {{be an increase in}} the sea surface temperature which may have benefits for some northerly Atlantic puffin colonies. Breeding success depends on there being ample supplies of food at the time of maximum demand, as the chick grows. In northern Norway the main food item fed to the chick is the young herring. The success of the newly hatched fish larvae during the previous year was governed by the water temperature, which controlled plankton abundance and this in turn influenced the growth and survival of the first-year herring. The breeding success of Atlantic puffin colonies has been found to correlate in this way with the water surface temperatures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
5|$|Copa Libertadores was {{the only}} {{continental}} competition in South America until {{the creation of the}} Supercopa Libertadores in 1988, and the Recopa Sudamericana in 1989.

Other Copas were also created by the continental confederation in the 1990s, some of them with a single game, mainly contested between past winners of the previous competitions. Copa Mercosur and the Copa Merconorte replaced the Supercopa in 1998, and eventually absorbed Copa CONMEBOL in 2000. The two competitions were replaced by the Copa Sudamericana in 2002, which remains active as the second most important tournament on the continent.|$|E
