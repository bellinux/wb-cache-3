2500|$|The September 11 Attacks in the United States led to {{demands from}} the public that US {{president}} George Bush take actions that would prevent further attacks. This pressure led to {{the launch of the}} War on Terror. The fact that the perceived enemies in the War on Terror were stateless individuals, and the perceived threat of extreme strategies including suicide bombing, led to a pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> to act decisively. In addition, these tactics created the perception that the [...] "legitimate" [...] techniques used in the cold war would not be of much use. US vice-president Dick Cheney stated, for example, that the US [...] " [...] to work sort of on the dark side", and that it had to [...] "use any means at [...] disposal".|$|E

I wasn't alone. But I was surely wrong."

An article by Ximena Ortiz in the National Interest Online called Cohen's ability to do the job into question and attempted to juxtapose his previous statements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> foreign policy with the resulting war in Iraq. Adding to the criticism was Glenn Greenwald of Salon.com who, describing Cohen as [...] "extremist a neoconservative and warmonger as it gets", suggested an internal significance of the appointment for the Bush administration:The Cohen appointment, is clearly another instance where neoconservatives place a watchdog in potential trouble spots in the government to ensure that diplomats do not stray by trying to facilitate rapproachments between the U.S. and the countries on the neoconservative War hit list.|$|E

Titled A Crow Left of the Murder..., the album was to be an enhanced CD with behind-the-scenes video. In the videos, Einziger and Boyd discussed their new songs. Einziger described them as [...] "like the old shit, but older. It's very different. It's very energetic and fast, {{and a lot of}} it is more technical. I guess maybe in the vein of more of our older songs; they don't sound like our older songs. They are more exploratory." [...] It was the last Incubus album to be labelled as [...] "alternative metal" [...] by the media, with subsequent albums from the band diverting even further from this sound. On December 15, 2003, the first single, [...] "Megalomaniac", was released. It raised controversy when it was said to be an attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> and was banned from daytime view on MTV (despite the band saying that it was not an attack on a particular person, rather a comment on some people's negative attitudes). However, the band was actually pleased with this nighttime viewing restriction.

Pasillas reflected Boyd's sentiments, saying, [...] "I think it's okay if people think that we're trying to make a political statement.
