5|$|Rockefeller {{and his son}} {{continued}} to consolidate their oil interests {{as best they could}} until New Jersey, in 1909, changed its incorporation laws to effectively allow a re-creation of the trust {{in the form of a}} single holding company. Rockefeller retained his nominal title as president until 1911 and he kept his stock. At last in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. By then the trust still had a 70% market share of the refined oil market but only 14% of the U.S. crude oil supply. The court ruled that the trust originated in illegal monopoly practices and ordered it to be broken up into 34 new companies. These included, among many others, Continental Oil, which became Conoco, now part of ConocoPhillips; Standard of Indiana, which became Amoco, now part of BP; Standard of California, which became Chevron; Standard of New Jersey, which became Esso (and later, Exxon), now part of ExxonMobil; Standard of New York, which became Mobil, now part of ExxonMobil; and Standard of Ohio, which became Sohio, now part <b>of</b> <b>BP.</b> Pennzoil and Chevron have remained separate companies.|$|E
40|$|Photodecomposition <b>of</b> bromophenols (<b>BPs)</b> {{represents}} a potent channel of debromination and elimination {{of these species}} in the environment. From this perspective, the present contribution reports geometrical parameters, electronic absorption spectra and excited states of the complete series <b>of</b> <b>BPs</b> in their ground state (S 0), {{as well as their}} first singlet exited state (S 1). We calculate excitation energies for S 0 → S 1 transition {{within the framework of the}} time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). We estimate and discuss charges on bromine atoms and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps (E H-L) as molecular descriptors for the photoreactivity <b>of</b> <b>BPs</b> and photo-induced debromination mechanism <b>of</b> <b>BPs.</b> Spectral patterns reveal that, as the degree of bromination increases, peaks of absorption spectra red-shift toward wavelengths near 300 nm, for the pentabrominated phenol. Based on the analysis of optimised geometries and Hirshfeld's atomic charges, photodebromination <b>of</b> <b>BPs</b> commences via the loss of an ortho Br atom. The excitation energies decrease linearly with increasing number of bromine atoms. This indicates that, higher brominated congeners <b>of</b> <b>BPs</b> photodecompose more readily than lower brominated congeners...|$|R

40|$|Osteoporosis and {{depression}} are prevalent among older postmenopausal women 65 years or older. Bisphosphonates (BPs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) {{are commonly used}} medications to treat these conditions. Inhibitory effects <b>of</b> <b>BPs</b> on osteoclasts {{are responsible for the}} reduction in fracture risk. SSRIs, however, are associated with increased fracture risk through decreasing osteoblasts and increasing osteoclastic activity. These effects of SSRIs could attenuate the beneficial effects <b>of</b> <b>BPs.</b> This dissertation describes the concomitant use <b>of</b> <b>BPs</b> and SSRIs among postmeopausa women and reports findings from examining the association between concomitant use <b>of</b> <b>BPs</b> and SSRIs and fracture risk. Separate cross-sectional analyses were performed using data from the 2004 - 2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and Medicare Part D prescriptions claims data (2008 - 2010) to examine usage patterns <b>of</b> <b>BPs</b> and SSRIs/SNRIs for women aged ≥ 45 years and ≥ 65 years, respectively. For our second objective, a nested-case control was conducted using Medicare claims data (2008 - 2010). Data from Medicare inpatient claims were linked to Medicare Part D data for all female BP users 65 years or older. We used Cox proportional hazards model to assess the increased risk of osteoporotic-related fractures among propensity score matched (1 : 1 ratio) cohorts of concomitant users <b>of</b> <b>BPs</b> and SSRIs and BP alone users. Concomitant use <b>of</b> <b>BPs</b> and SSRIs was prevalent and increased with age for each timeframe examined. Findings showed that approximately 12 % (using MEPS) and 28 % (using Medicare data) <b>of</b> women on <b>BPs</b> were also on SSRIs. For the second objective, 4, 214 propensity score matched pairs (average age= 80. 4 years) of subjects were analyzed. Findings showed that concomitant use <b>of</b> <b>BPs</b> and SSRIs was associated with statistically significant increased risk for any fracture (HR= 1. 29, 95 % CI, 1. 07 - 1. 57), but statistically non-significant increased risk for hip (HR= 1. 16, 95 % CI, 0. 92 - 1. 47) and vertebral fractures (HR= 1. 55, 95 % CI, 0. 97 - 2. 48). Current findings indicate that concomitant use <b>of</b> <b>BPs</b> and SSRIs is not uncommon among postmenopausal women and suggest potential attenuation of antifracture efficacy <b>of</b> <b>BPs</b> by SSRIs. Further studies are needed to understand the clinical impact of concomitant use of these medications among older postmenopausal women...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Desorption/adsorption <b>of</b> bisphenols (<b>BPs)</b> in soils {{affects their}} {{mobility}} and availability. However, the kinetics {{of these processes}} have not been well studied, {{due to the lack}} of appropriate means of measurement. Diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) technique can assess kinetic processes in soils and have recently been developed for measuring three BPs (BPA, BPB and BPF). DGT was deployed for 2. 5 h to 20 d in five soils with different soil properties. Non-linear increase in mass accumulation by DGT with time indicated poor resupply <b>of</b> <b>BPs</b> from soil solid to solution phase. By fitting the data with DIFS (DGT-induced fluxes in soils) model, values for the labile partition coefficient (Kdl), response time (tc) and rates of exchange (k 1 and k- 1) <b>of</b> <b>BPs</b> between soil solid and solution phases were obtained. The derived values of Kdl showed that most <b>of</b> the <b>BPs</b> in the soil could participate in labile exchange. Average response times of 1 – 2 h implied that the supply <b>of</b> <b>BPs</b> to DGT was limited by their desorption rate. Soils with more binding sites (higher DOM, CEC and Fe oxides) could resupply BPs more quickly, highlighting the danger of just considering partition effects...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{argues that}} English bare plurals (BPs) uniformly have a plain existential semantics.

The variant Firemen are tall triggers the implicature that this ``only-some'' implicature is false. The universal reading <b>of</b> the <b>BP</b> thus arises through a ''not-only-some'' implicature.
