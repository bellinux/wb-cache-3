5|$|Prior to the {{recording}} of the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial album, Jackson released four solo studio albums with Motown Records (Got to Be There, Ben, Music & Me and Forever, Michael), and several with his brothers as part of The Jackson 5. In 1975, he moved to Epic Records and in 1979 released <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall,</b> to critical and commercial success.|$|E
5|$|The {{record was}} a {{departure}} from Jackson's previous work for Motown Records. Its lyrical themes on the record relate to escapism, liberation, loneliness, hedonism and romance. Several critics observed that <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> was crafted from funk, disco, soft rock, jazz, Broadway and pop ballads. Jackson received positive reviews for his vocal performance on the record. The record gained critical acclaim and recognition, and won the singer his first Grammy Award.|$|E
5|$|After a {{match at}} Cincinnati Gardens, an enraged fan took a fire {{extinguisher}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> {{and threw it}} at Costello and Kent from the balcony of the Gardens. The extinguisher hit Costello in the hip, damaging {{it so much that}} he needed hip replacement surgery later that year. The fan was arrested, served 15days in jail, and fined fifty dollars for damaging the fire extinguisher. The hip injury left Costello unable to wrestle, and The Fabulous Kangaroos split up once again. Costello had a full hip replacement and was forced to retire from active competition.|$|E

5|$|Number Ones is a video album by American {{recording}} artist Michael Jackson. It {{was released on}} DVD on November 13, 2003 under the Epic Records record label, {{in conjunction with the}} promotion for Jackson's greatest hits album, of the same name (although the album and DVD have different songs). The DVD, which is Jackson's fourth DVD album, contained fifteen music videos, which was directed and produced by various people. It consists of music videos filmed and released by Jackson from 1979's <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> to 2001's Invincible. Just like the album, the DVD has four different covers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> is {{the fifth}} album by American singer Michael Jackson, {{released}} on August 10, 1979 in the United States by Epic Records and internationally by CBS Records. It was his nineteenth album in total since Diana Ross Presents The Jackson 5 (1969), {{as well as his}} first album released through Epic Records, the label he would record on until his death roughly 30 years later. It was released following Jackson's critically well-received film performance in The Wiz. While working on that project, Jackson and Quincy Jones had become friends, and Jones agreed to work with Jackson on his next studio album.|$|E
5|$|Thriller is {{the sixth}} studio album by American singer Michael Jackson, {{released}} on November 30, 1982, in the United States by Epic Records and internationally by CBS Records.

Recording sessions for the album took place from April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, with a production budget of $750,000. Quincy Jones produced the album, and Jackson wrote four of its nine songs.|$|E

5|$|Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom is a side-scrolling {{platform}} game {{in which}} the player controls the player character Ryu Hayabusa as he investigates the events behind Irene Lew's death. In the game, Ryu can jump, hang, and climb up and down walls with the control pad; pressing the jump button while holding the control pad the direction {{away from the wall}} causes Ryu to spring <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Ryu is also able to attack enemies with secondary weapons while on a wall by pressing the attack button. A new feature introduced in Ninja GaidenIII is the ability for Ryu to hang overhead from pipes or ivy; he can swing up on top or drop from them, and as with walls, he can only attack enemies while hanging with secondary weapons.|$|E
5|$|Royce begins rapping in {{a prison}} cell, until he finds a poster and peels it <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> to find a door compartment, a {{reference}} to 1994 drama film The Shawshank Redemption. He crawls through it and finds himself in the tunnel. Royce lights a flare to help navigate through the system. As Mars sings the bridge, the two rappers find {{their way out of}} the tunnels, through a manhole which leads them to a field where Mars sings. As the sun starts to set, couples, along with Bad Meets Evil, gather to see a large group of rising sky lanterns aglow. Beats by Dr. Dre headphones are advertised in the video and one couple gathers in front of a Chrysler 300. As the video reaches its conclusion, the setting gets dark and Mars sings the last lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceiling of}} the Sistine Chapel {{was to have a}} {{profound}} effect upon other artists, even before it was completed. Vasari, in his Life of Raphael, tells us that Bramante, who had the keys to the chapel, let Raphael in to examine the paintings in Michelangelo's absence. On seeing Michelangelo's prophets, Raphael went back to the picture of the Prophet Isaiah that he was painting on a column in the Church of Sant'Agostino and, according to Vasari, although it was finished, he scraped it <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and repainted it in a much more powerful manner, in imitation of Michelangelo. John O'Malley points out that even earlier than the Isaiah is Raphael's inclusion of the figure of Heraclitus in the School of Athens, a brooding figure similar to Michelangelo's Jeremiah, but with the countenace of Michelangelo himself, and leaning on a block of marble.|$|E

5|$|As the Griffin family {{prepare to}} sit down for their dinner, baby Stewie is shown {{watching}} television, with the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade taking place on the screen. Stewie notices a hot air balloon in the parade resembling himself. After the family decides {{to go to the}} Griffin family's backyard to play football, Joe approaches his son to encourage him to beat the other team. Joe then references the 2009 war film The Hurt Locker, with Kevin responding with disdain for the film, despite supposedly being in a coma during its release. Joe also goes on to point out that Kevin is wearing an Ed Hardy t-shirt, which also became popularized during his supposed coma, and despite Kevin telling his father that he flew straight home after he awoke. Later during dinner, when Kevin reveals that he went A.W.O.L., Peter makes an <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> reference, causing the episode to cut to a room showing several of the show's editors, who become confused about what cutaway to play on the screen. They then decide to play a clip involving several characters from The Wizard of Oz, including the Cowardly Lion, who is shown to be actress Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 Hebrew {{linguist}} {{and publisher}} Rabbi Chaim Hirschensohn became entangled in a failed effort {{to purchase the}} Western Wall and lost all his assets. Even the attempts of the Palestine Land Development Company to purchase the environs of the Western Wall for the Jews just before the outbreak of World War I never came to fruition. In {{the first two months}} following the Ottoman Empire’s entry into the First World War, the Turkish governor of Jerusalem, Zakey Bey, offered to sell the Moroccan Quarter, which consisted of about 25 houses, to the Jews in order to enlarge the area available to them for prayer. He requested a sum of £20,000 which would be used to both rehouse the Muslim families and to create a public garden in front of the Wall. However, the Jews of the city lacked the necessary funds. A few months later, under Muslim Arab pressure on the Turkish authorities in Jerusalem, Jews became forbidden by official decree to place benches and light candles at the Wall. This sour turn in relations was taken up by the Chacham Bashi who managed to get the ban overturned. In 1915 it was reported that Djemal Pasha closed <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> to visitation as a sanitary measure.|$|E

25|$|While {{working on}} the film The Wiz, Michael Jackson asked Jones to {{recommend}} some producers for his upcoming solo record. Jones offered some names, but eventually offered to produce the record. Jackson accepted and the resulting record, <b>Off</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wall,</b> ultimately sold about 20 million copies. This made Jones the most powerful record producer in the industry at that time. Jones's and Jackson's next collaboration, Thriller, sold a reputed 110 million copies and became the highest-selling album of all time. (The rise of MTV {{and the advent of}} music videos as promotional tools also contributed to Thriller's multimillion-copy sales figures and high monetary grosses.) Jones also worked on Jackson's album Bad, which has sold 45 million copies. Bad was the last time the pair worked together in the studio. Audio interviews with Jones are featured on the 2001 special editions of <b>Off</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wall,</b> Thriller, and Bad.|$|E
