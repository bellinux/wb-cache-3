5|$|A {{transitional}} fossil is any fossilized remains <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> {{form that}} exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This {{is especially important}} where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve {{as a reminder that}} taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually no way to know exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E
5|$|According to Thompson, the Navy {{immediately}} began efforts {{to cover up}} the cause of the explosion. Rear Admiral Richard Milligan, assigned to lead the investigation, soon focused his inquiry into trying to prove that one of the deceased turret's crewmembers, Clayton Hartwig, had intentionally caused the explosion. After learning that Hartwig had named another sailor and friend, Kendall Truitt, as a beneficiary <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> insurance policy on himself, Milligan enlisted the help of the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) (the predecessor of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service or NCIS) to investigate Hartwig and Truitt.|$|E

The task involved what Suzuki described as four years of mental, physical, moral, and intellectual struggle. During training periods at Engaku-ji, Suzuki lived <b>a</b> monk's <b>life.</b> He described this life and his own experience at Kamakura in his book The Training of the Zen Buddhist Monk. Suzuki characterized the facets of the training as: <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> humility; <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> labor; <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> service; <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> prayer and gratitude; and <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> meditation.|$|R

5|$|The {{title of}} the episode is an homage to Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel Last Exit to Brooklyn, one subplot of which {{involves}} the corruption and downfall of a union leader during a strike. The body of the union president is seen buried under a football field, a homage to the mystery surrounding the whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa and his alleged burial at New Jersey's Giants Stadium. Mr. Burns' outfit in the flashback to his childhood is based on Buster Brown. Homer's imagination <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> of organized crime is based on Don Fanucci's first appearance in The Godfather Part II, accepting donuts rather than a necklace and an orange.|$|E

When Orson refuses to say please while Bree brings him breakfast, she places the waffles on a shelf he cannot reach. When the physical therapist arrives, he pretends to be starving and abused. The therapist tells Bree she must be more patient, or she will be reported. Later, when Orson still refuses to be bathed, Bree takes him outside and sprays him with the garden hose until he begs her to stop. He breaks down and admits he is miserable at the prospective <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> in which he needs {{to ask for help}} in everything. Bree finally understands, and asks Orson for forgiveness.|$|E
2500|$|As the Chan school grew in China, {{the monastic}} {{discipline}} also became distinct, focusing on practice through {{all aspects of}} life. Temples began emphasizing labor and humility, expanding the training of Chan to include the mundane tasks of daily life. D.T.

5|$|Mario's health {{consists}} of a three-piece health meter, which is depleted through contact with enemies and hazards. When swimming underwater, Mario has an air supply meter, which quickly depletes his main health meter if it runs out. Mario's health and air supply can be restored by collecting coins, or through touching bubbles if underwater. When the health meter becomes empty, the player loses a life and must {{go back to a}} predetermined checkpoint. The health meter can be temporarily expanded to six units through the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Life</b> Mushroom, with the maximum health returning to three units if the overall health falls to three units from enemy or hazard contact, or if Mario suffers instant death. Instant death can occur by being swallowed by quicksand or dark matter; falling into bottomless pits, which either consist of black holes or by leaving a planet's gravitational pull and falling into space. The player can obtain extra lives by collecting 1-Up Mushrooms, 50 coins without losing a life, or 50 Star Bits.|$|E

40|$|The Value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Statistical <b>Life</b> {{represents}} {{how much}} a population values reducing the probability of death. American citizens and government agencies use the Value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Statistical <b>Life</b> estimates in benefit-cost analysis to pass life-saving policies. The public uses this measurement as a scientific and objective tool to identify potentially favorable policy from ineffective and inefficient policy. Institutional incentives, however, are aligned for agencies to exaggerate Value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Statistical <b>Life</b> calculations and overregulate markets. This thesis summarizes how the Value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Statistical <b>Life</b> data sources, methods of estimation, and inconsistent behavioral reference points distort the statistical calculations. Despite the distorted estimation, agencies still rely heavily on the Value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Statistical <b>Life</b> as <b>a</b> tool to pass policy. Public choice theory explains that agencies employ distorted information as a tactic to pass regulation. The theory demonstrates that regulators are self-interested not unlike the general public. This thesis provides a public choice analysis and concludes that agencies are incentivized to employ distorted data sources, methods of calculation, and public risk perceptions to inflate the Value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Statistical <b>Life</b> and overregulate. <b>As</b> such, the Value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Statistical <b>Life</b> {{will continue to be}} biased and inaccurate with the current methods of calculation and addressing political incentives...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{estimates}} the marginal cost <b>of</b> saving <b>a</b> <b>life</b> using age- and gender-specific health care expenditures and mortality {{rates of the}} 26 Swiss cantons for the period 1997 to 2006. It shows almost triple the marginal cost <b>of</b> saving <b>a</b> <b>life</b> for women as compared to men, reflecting a lower marginal elasticity <b>of</b> medical inputs, <b>a</b> lower mortality rate and higher spending on health care for women. Medical technology does not differ across cantons while the marginal cost <b>of</b> saving <b>a</b> <b>life</b> does. Wealthy cantons spend more on saving <b>a</b> <b>life</b> at the margin and show a smaller gender gap in longevity.|$|R
