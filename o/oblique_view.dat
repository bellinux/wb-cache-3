60|$|Arrived {{where they}} could get a good <b>oblique</b> <b>view</b> of the Duomo, the party paused. The {{festoons}} and devices placed over the central doorway excited some demur, and Tornabuoni beckoned to Piero di Cosimo, who, as was usual with him at this hour, was lounging in front of Nello's shop. There was soon an animated discussion, and it became highly amusing from the Frenchman's astonishment at Picro's odd pungency of statement, which Tito translated literally. Even snarling onlookers became curious, and their faces began to wear the half-smiling, half-humiliated expression {{of people who are}} not within hearing of the joke which is producing infectious laughter. It was a delightful moment for Tito, for {{he was the only one}} of the party who could have made so amusing an interpreter, and without any disposition to triumphant self-gratulation he revelled in the sense that he was an object of liking--he basked in approving glances. The rainbow light fell about the laughing group, and the grave church-goers had all disappeared within the walls. It seemed as if the piazza had been decorated for a real Florentine holiday.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{radiographic}} {{examination of the}} distal and proximal interphalangeal joints was performed in 43 randomly selected horses. A total of 86 forelimbs were examined. On the forelimbs, dorsolateral-palmaromedial, and dorsomedial-palmarolateral <b>oblique</b> <b>views</b> were performed. The <b>oblique</b> <b>views</b> were performed on raised limbs placed in a navicular block and on weight-bearing limbs placed on a pedestal made at the equine clinic. In total, 688 dorsolateral-palmaromedial and dorsomedial-palmarolateral views were taken.

These signs were observed in 253 of 688 <b>oblique</b> <b>views.</b> Positive radiographic findings of the above-mentioned disorders were shown on 127 <b>oblique</b> <b>views</b> of the raised limb placed in the navicular block and 126 <b>oblique</b> <b>views</b> of the weight-bearin...|$|R

6000|$|There {{was always}} a little doubt as to who would serve the church. One of the Canons was the incumbent, and the curate was Mr. Arden, the {{scientific}} minor canon, but when his services were required at the cathedral, one of his colleagues would supply his place, usually in a sadly perfunctory manner. However, he was there in person, as his voice, a clear and pleasant one, showed the denizens of the [...] "closet," [...] for they could not see out of it, except where Eugene had furtively enlarged a moth-eaten hole in the curtain, through which, when standing on the seat, he could enjoy an <b>oblique</b> <b>view</b> {{of the back of}} an iron-moulded surplice and a very ill-powdered wig.

[...] It would have been thought unladylike, if not unscriptural, to open the lips in church; yet, for all her silence, good Betty was striving to be devout and attentive, praying earnestly for her little sister's safety, and hailing as a kind of hopeful augury this verse from the singers-- ...|$|E
60|$|The {{brilliant}} illumination within {{seemed to}} press upon {{his eyes with}} palpable force after the pale scattered lights and broad shadows of the piazza, {{and for the first}} minute or two he could see nothing distinctly. That yellow splendour was in itself something supernatural and heavenly to many of the peasant-women, for whom half the sky was hidden by mountains, and who went to bed in the twilight; and the uninterrupted chant from the choir was repose to the ear after the hellish hubbub of the crowd outside. Gradually the scene became clearer, though still there was a thin yellow haze from incense mingling with the breath of the multitude. In a chapel on the left-hand of the nave, wreathed with silver lamps, was seen unveiled the miraculous fresco of the Annunciation, which, in Tito's <b>oblique</b> <b>view</b> of it from the right-hand side of the nave, seemed dark with the excess of light around it. The whole area of the great church was filled with peasant-women, some kneeling, some standing; the coarse bronzed skins, and the dingy clothing of the rougher dwellers on the mountains, contrasting with the softer-lined faces and white or red head-drapery of the well-to-do dwellers in the valley, who were scattered in irregular groups. And spreading high and far over the walls and ceiling there was another multitude, also pressing close against each other, that they might be nearer the potent Virgin. It was the crowd of votive waxen images, the effigies of great personages, clothed in their habit as they lived: Florentines of high name in their black silk lucco, as when they sat in council; popes, emperors, kings, cardinals, and famous condottieri with plumed morion seated on their chargers; all notable strangers who passed through Florence or had aught to do with its affairs--Mohammedans, even, in well-tolerated companionship with Christian cavaliers; some of them with faces blackened and robes tattered by the corroding breath of centuries, others fresh and bright in new red mantle or steel corselet, the exact doubles of the living. And wedged in with all these were detached arms, legs, and other members, with only here and there a gap where some image had been removed for public disgrace, or had fallen ominously, as Lorenzo's had done six months before. It was a perfect resurrection-swarm of remote mortals and fragments of mortals, reflecting, in their varying degrees of freshness, the sombre dinginess and sprinkled brightness of the crowd below.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether a swimmer's view or supine (trauma) <b>oblique</b> <b>views</b> {{are more likely to}} visualise the lower cervical spine when a lateral view fails to show the cervicothoracic junction. DESIGN: A prospective study comparing two 20 week periods. In the first phase the swimmer's view was performed as an additional view when the cervicothoracic junction was not demonstrated. In the second phase paired supine <b>oblique</b> <b>views</b> replaced the swimmer's view. RESULTS: 230 patients were included in the first phase, of whom 60 required swimmer's views. In the second phase 62 of 197 patients required supine <b>oblique</b> <b>views.</b> Radiology analysis of 53 pairs of supine <b>oblique</b> <b>views</b> showed that the vertebral bodies were adequately demonstrated at the cervicothoracic junction in only 20 patients (38 %) compared with 22 in the swimmer's group (37 %). The facet joints and posterior elements were, however, clearly seen in 37 (70 %) of the supine oblique patients compared with 22 (37 %) of the swimmer's group (p < 0. 001, chi 2 test). Exposure dose calculations showed a substantial reduction for a pair of supine <b>oblique</b> <b>views</b> (1. 6 mGy) over a single swimmer's view (7. 2 mGy). CONCLUSIONS: In injured patients for whom the standard three view series fails to demonstrate the cervicothoracic junction, swimmer's <b>views</b> and supine <b>oblique</b> <b>views</b> show the alignment of the vertebral bodies with equal frequency. However, supine oblique films are safer, expose patients to less radiation, and are more often successful in demonstrating the posterior elements...|$|R

We investigated the effect of <b>oblique</b> <b>viewing</b> on axial and peripheral refraction.

In a second experiment, cycloplegic peripheral refraction measurements were taken out to Â± 34 Â° horizontally from fixation while the subjects rotated their heads to match the peripheral refraction angles (eye in primary position with respect to the head) or the eyes were rotated with respect to the head (<b>oblique</b> <b>viewing).</b> Subjects were 10 emmetropes and 10 myopes.

In addition to providing a wide field of view, mosaics with various <b>oblique</b> <b>views</b> well represent occlusion regions that cannot be seen in a usual nadir view. Stereo pair(s) can be formed from a pair of mosaics with different <b>oblique</b> <b>viewing</b> angles and thus image-based 3 D viewing can be achieved.

60|$|Beauty hath {{usually been}} said {{to consist in}} certain {{proportions}} of parts. On considering the matter, I have great reason to doubt, whether beauty be at all an idea belonging to proportion. Proportion relates almost wholly to convenience, as every idea of order seems to do; and it must therefore {{be considered as a}} creature of the understanding, rather than a primary cause acting on the senses and imagination. It is not by the force of long attention and inquiry that we find any object to be beautiful; beauty demands no assistance from our reasoning; even the will is unconcerned; the appearance of beauty as effectually causes some degree of love in us, as the application of ice or fire produces the ideas of heat or cold. To gain something like a satisfactory conclusion in this point, it were well to examine what proportion is; since several who make use of that word do not always seem to understand very clearly the force of the term, nor to have very distinct ideas concerning the thing itself. Proportion is the measure of relative quantity. Since all quantity is divisible, it is evident that every distinct part into which any quantity is divided must bear some relation to the other parts, or to the whole. These relations give an origin to the idea of proportion. They are discovered by mensuration, and they are the objects of mathematical inquiry. But whether any part of any determinate quantity be a fourth, or a fifth, or a sixth, or a moiety of the whole; or whether it be of equal length with any other part, or double its length, or but one half, is a matter merely indifferent to the mind; it stands neuter in the question: and it is from this absolute indifference and tranquillity of the mind, that mathematical speculations derive some of their most considerable advantages; because there is nothing to interest the imagination; because the judgment sits free and unbiassed to examine the point. All proportions, every arrangement of quantity, is alike to the understanding, because the same truths result to it from all; from greater, from lesser, from equality and inequality. But surely beauty is no idea belonging to mensuration; nor has it anything to do with calculation and geometry. If it had, we might then point out some certain measures which we could demonstrate to be beautiful, either as simply considered, or as related to others; and we could call in those natural objects, for whose beauty we have no voucher but the sense, to this happy standard, and confirm the voice of our passions by the determination of our reason. But since we have not this help, let us see whether proportion can in any sense be considered as the cause of beauty, as hath been so generally, and, by some, so confidently affirmed. If proportion be one of the constituents of beauty, it must derive that power either from some natural properties inherent in certain measures, which operate mechanically; from the operation of custom; or from the fitness which some measures have to answer some particular ends of conveniency. Our business therefore is to inquire, whether the parts of those objects, which are found beautiful in the vegetable or animal kingdoms, are constantly so formed according to such certain measures, as may serve to satisfy us that their beauty results from those measures, on the principle of a natural mechanical cause; or from custom; or, in fine, from their fitness for any determinate purposes. I intend to examine this point under each of these heads in their order. But before I proceed further, I hope it will not be thought amiss, if I lay down the rules which governed me in this inquiry, and which have misled me in it, if I have gone astray. 1. If two bodies produce the same or a similar effect on the mind, and on examination they are found to agree in some of their properties, and to differ in others; the common effect is to be attributed to the properties in which they agree, and not to those in which they differ. 2. Not to account for the effect of a natural object from the effect of an artificial object. 3. Not to account for the effect of any natural object from a conclusion of our reason concerning its uses, if a natural cause may be assigned. 4. Not to admit any determinate quantity, or any relation of quantity, as the cause of a certain effect, if the effect is produced by different or opposite measures and relations; or if these measures and relations may exist, and yet the effect may not be produced. These are the rules which I have chiefly followed, whilst I examined into the power of proportion considered as a natural cause; and these, if he thinks them just, I request the reader to carry with him throughout the following discussion; whilst we inquire, in the first place, in what things we find this quality of beauty; next, to see whether in these we can find any assignable proportions in such a manner as ought to convince us that our idea of beauty results from them. We shall consider this pleasing power as it appears in vegetables, in the inferior animals, and in man. Turning our eyes to the vegetable creation, we find nothing there so beautiful as flowers; but flowers are almost of every sort of shape, and of every sort of disposition; they are turned and fashioned into an infinite variety of forms; and from these forms botanists have given them their names, which are almost as various. What proportion do we discover between the stalks and the leaves of flowers, or between the leaves and the pistils? How does the slender stalk of the rose agree with the bulky head under which it bends? but the rose is a beautiful flower; and can we undertake to say that it does not owe a great deal of its beauty even to that disproportion; the rose is a large flower, yet it grows upon a small shrub; the flower of the apple is very small, and grows upon a large tree; yet the rose and the apple blossom are both beautiful, and the plants that bear them are most engagingly attired, notwithstanding this disproportion. What by general consent is allowed to be a more beautiful object than an orange-tree, nourishing at once with its leaves, its blossoms, and its fruit? but it is in vain that we search here for any proportion between the height, the breadth, or anything else concerning the dimensions of the whole, or concerning the relation of the particular parts to each other. I grant that we may observe in many flowers something of a regular figure, and of a methodical disposition of the leaves. The rose has such a figure and such a disposition of its petals; but in an <b>oblique</b> <b>view,</b> when this figure is in a good measure lost, and the order of the leaves confounded, it yet retains its beauty; the rose is even more beautiful before it is full blown; in the bud; before this exact figure is formed; and this is not the only instance wherein method and exactness, the soul of proportion, are found rather prejudicial than serviceable to the cause of beauty.|$|E

Case presentation A healthy 26 -year-old Caucasian male fell whilst jogging, suffering a low velocity injury to his right hand. Initial accident and emergency examination and x-rays failed to demonstrate a fracture. At clinic, anteroposterior and carpal tunnel radiographs showed no fracture, however a mistakenly taken oblique x-ray revealed a displaced hamate body fracture. Conclusion The authors believe that where a hamate fracture is suspected, an <b>oblique</b> x-ray <b>view</b> should be considered as part of the initial diagnostic investigations. Furthermore an <b>oblique</b> x-ray <b>view</b> is of particular use when clinical suspicion for hamate fracture remains high in the light of otherwise normal x-rays. </p...|$|R
