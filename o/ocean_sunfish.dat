5|$|Pelagic {{stingrays}} may segregate by sex, vertically in {{that males}} {{are found in}} deeper water than females, and perhaps horizontally as well. Captive individuals often act highly aggressively towards <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> (Mola mola), biting and harassing them, particularly if they are hungry. This species is preyed upon by oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus), great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), toothed whales, and other large, ocean-going carnivores. Its all-around dark coloration likely serves to camouflage it against its featureless habitat. The venom on its tail spine is also quite potent, causing it to be avoided by other fishes. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium benedeni, A. crassicolle, and A. filicolle, Rhinebothrium baeri and R. palombii, and Tetragonocephalum uarnak, and the monogenean Entobdella diadema.|$|E
25|$|Oceanic {{epipelagic fish}} can be true residents, partial residents, or {{accidental}} residents. True residents live their entire {{life in the}} open ocean. Only a few species are true residents, such as tuna, billfish, flying fish, sauries, pilotfish and remoras, dolphin, ocean sharks and <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish.</b> Most of these species migrate {{back and forth across}} open oceans, rarely venturing over continental shelves. Some true residents associate with drifting jellyfish or seaweeds.|$|E
25|$|The {{waters off}} of the coast of San Diego–Tijuana are densely {{populate}} by the denizens of the kelp forests. Kelp forests are found {{to a great extent}} and are populated by Garibaldi, leopard sharks, gobies, rockfish, and sculpins. Great white sharks have been observed in the waters off the coast, while there are numerous documentations of their occurrence in the waters off Guadalupe Island. From the confines of the forests, ocean-going species such as the <b>Ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> are observed.|$|E

50|$|Robert Collett, who {{examined}} {{some of the}} first known specimens of sharptail mola, speculated they might represent abnormal <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfishes</b> that had retained larval characteristics. However, the caudal projection is now known to be a secondary development that follows the loss of the primary tail. The swimming mode of the sharptail {{is similar to that of}} other <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfishes,</b> using sculling motions of its long dorsal and anal fins to propel itself through the water. The anal fin moves more extensively than the dorsal fin. The small pectoral fins move constantly to control pitch, while the clavus is employed as a rudder.|$|R
50|$|Austromola angerhoferi is an {{extinct species}} of the <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfishes</b> (Molidae). It is known from the Lower Miocene Ebelsberg Formation near Pucking, Austria. This species was a {{resident}} of the Paratethys Sea and is estimated to have reached a length around 320 cm.|$|R
25|$|Pelagic fish {{range in}} size from small coastal forage fish, such as {{herrings}} and sardines, to large apex predator oceanic fishes, such as bluefin tuna and oceanic sharks. They are usually agile swimmers with streamlined bodies, capable of sustained cruising on long-distance migrations. The Indo-Pacific sailfish, an oceanic pelagic fish, can sprint at over 110 kilometres per hour. Some tuna species cruise across the Pacific Ocean. Many pelagic fish swim in schools weighing hundreds of tonnes. Others are solitary, like the large <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> weighing over 500 kilograms, which sometimes drift passively with ocean currents, eating jellyfish.|$|E

While the Open Sea community exhibit contains hammerhead sharks, pelagic stingrays, and green sea turtles, {{it is known}} for housing species unique to North American public aquariums such as bluefin and yellowfin tunas, schooling Pacific sardines, and the <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish.</b> Six great white sharks were displayed in the Open Sea exhibit between 2004–2011, an effort contested by some but generally described as having a positive scientific and educational impact. Prior to the display of the first white shark for six months before its release, the longest length of time that a white shark survived in an aquarium was 16 days.|$|E
500|$|The teleosts or Teleostei (Greek: teleios, [...] "complete" [...] + osteon, [...] "bone") {{are by far}} {{the largest}} infraclass in the class Actinopterygii, the ray-finned fishes, and make up 96% of all extant species of fish.

5000|$|A sunfish (or mola) is any {{fish in the}} Mola genus (family Molidae). The fishes {{develop their}} truncated, bullet-like shape because the back fin, {{with which they are}} born, never grows. Instead, it folds into itself as the {{creature}} matures, creating a rounded rudder called a clavus. Mola in Latin means [...] "millstone" [...] and describes the <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish’s</b> somewhat circular shape. They are a silvery color and have a rough skin texture.|$|R
40|$|<b>Ocean</b> <b>sunfishes,</b> Molidae, {{comprise}} the world’s heaviest bony fishes. They include the short mola, Mola ramsayi (Giglioli 1883), an important tourist draw at Nusa Penida and Nusa Lembongan, Bali, where SCUBA divers can observe ectoparasite-laden individuals being cleaned by smaller reef fishes. Despite widespread appeal, {{little is known}} about these fishes relative to regional oceanography. We present the first behavioral information for this species anywhere in the world. Satellite tag data indicate a wide thermal range (10 – 27. 5 °C) with depth occupation mostly (95 %) in the upper 250 [*]m and habitat preference {{near the bottom of the}} warm surface layer. One tag popped off as scheduled after 6 months off Nusa Penida, < 10 [*]km from its original deployment. The 3 other tags popped off prematurely: 747 [*]km southeast 89 days after deployment; 142 [*]km south after 7 days of deployment; and 162 [*]km south after 24 days of deployment. Amid mounting tourist pressures and bycatch of M. ramsayi in eastern regions of Indonesia, such as Alor, behavioral information of this species is essential for effective management and conservation of this valuable marine ecotourism asset...|$|R

2500|$|Remoras are {{a family}} (Echeneidae) of ray-finned fish. They grow to [...] long, and their {{distinctive}} first dorsal fins {{take the form}} of a modified oval, sucker-like organ with slat-like structures that open and close to create suction and take a firm hold against the skin of larger marine animals. By sliding backward, the remora can increase the suction, or it can release itself by swimming forward. [...] Remoras sometimes attach to small boats. They swim well on their own, with a sinuous, or curved, motion. [...] When the remora reaches about , the disc is fully formed and the remora can then attach to other animals. The remora's lower jaw projects beyond the upper, and the animal lacks a swim bladder. [...] Some remoras associate primarily with specific host species. They are commonly found attached to sharks, manta rays, whales, turtles, and dugongs. [...] Smaller remoras also fasten onto fish such as tuna and swordfish, and some small remoras travel in the mouths or gills of large manta rays, <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish,</b> swordfish, and sailfish. The remora benefits by using the host as transport and protection, and also feeds on materials dropped by the host.|$|E
40|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfishes</b> (Molidae) has a complicated history. Currently, three genera and four species are recognized, including {{two in the}} genus Mola (M. mola and M. ramsayi). In 2009, a genetic study revealed a potential third species, Mola species C, in Southeast Australian waters. Concentrating on this region, we obtained samples and morphological data from 27 Mola sp. C specimens, genetically confirmed {{the existence of this}} species (mtDNA D-loop and cytochrome c oxidase 1), and established its morphology across a size spectrum of 50 – 242 cm total length. Mola sp. C is diagnosed by clavus meristics [15 – 17 fin rays (13 – 15 principal, 2 minor), 5 – 7 ossicles, paraxial ossicles separate], clavus morphology (prominent smooth band back-fold, rounded clavus edge with an indent), and body scale morphology (raised conical midpoints, non-branching). This species does not develop a protruding snout, or swollen dorso- or ventrolateral ridges. Body proportions remain similar with growth. A review of the historic literature revealed that Mola sp. C is a new, hitherto undescribed species, M. tecta, which we describe and diagnose, and that it is the first proposed addition to the genus Mola in 125 years. Its core distribution is likely in the temperate waters of the Southern Hemisphere...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS. The use of fossils in the phylogenetics of extant clades {{traditionally}} {{has been a}} contentious issue. Fossils usually are relatively incomplete, and their use commonly leads {{to an increase in}} the number of equally most parsimonious trees and a decrease in the resolution of phylogenies. Fossils alone, however, provide certain kinds of information about the biological history of a clade, and computer simulations have shown that even highly incomplete material can, under certain circumstances, increase the accuracy of a phylogeny, rather than decrease it. Because empirical data are still scarce on the effects of the inclusion of fossils on phylogenetic reconstruc-tions, we attempted to investigate this problem by using a relatively well-known group of acanthomorph fishes, the Tetraodontiformes (triggerfishes, pufferfishes, and <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfishes),</b> for which robust phylogenies using extant taxa already exist and that has a well-studied fossil record. Adding incomplete fossil taxa of tetraodontiforms usually increases the number of equally most parsimonious trees and often decreases the resolution of consensus trees. However, adding fossil taxa may help to correctly establish relationships among lineages that have experienced high degrees of morphological diversification by allowing for a reinterpre-tation of homologous and homoplastic features, increasing the resolution rather than decreasing it. Fur-thermore, taxa that were scored for 25 % or more of their characters did not cause a significant loss of resolution, while providing unique biological information...|$|R
2500|$|Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is {{a poison}} {{produced}} by organisms {{belonging to the}} Tetradontidae order, which includes the puffer fish, <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish,</b> and porcupine fish. Within the puffer fish, which is a common delicacy especially in Japan, TTX {{is found in the}} liver, gonads, ovaries, intestines, and skin. TTX can be fatal if consumed, and has become a common form of poisoning in many countries. Common symptoms of TTX consumption include paraesthesia (often restricted to the mouth and limbs), muscle weakness, nausea, and vomiting and often manifest within 30 minutes of ingestion. The primary mechanism by which TTX is toxic is through the inhibition of sodium channel function, which reduces the functional capacity of neuron communication. This inhibition largely affects a susceptible subset of sodium channels known as TTX-sensitive (TTX-s), which also happens to be largely responsible for the sodium current that drives the depolarization phase of neuron action potentials. [...] TTX-resistant (TTX-r) is another form of sodium channel which has limited sensitivity to TTX, and is largely found in small diameter axons such as those found in nociception neurons. When significant levels of TTX is ingested, it will bind sodium channels on neurons and reduce their membrane permeability to sodium. This results in an increased effective threshold of required excitatory signals in order to induce an action potential in a postsynaptic neuron. The effect of this increased signaling threshold is a reduced excitability of postsynaptic neurons, and subsequent loss of motor and sensory function which can result in paralysis and death. Though assisted ventilation may increase the chance of survival after TTX exposure, there is currently no antitoxin. The use of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor Neostigmine or the muscarinic acetylcholine antagonist Atropine (which will inhibit parasympathetic activity), however, can increase sympathetic nerve activity enough to improve the chance of survival after TTX exposure.|$|E
2500|$|Leedsichthys is {{the largest}} known member of the Osteichthyes or bony fishes, with the {{exception}} of the largest descendants of land-dwelling Tetrapodomorpha (e.g. giant sauropods and whales), not commonly thought of as [...] "fishes". The largest extant non-tetrapodomorph bony fish is the <b>Ocean</b> <b>sunfish,</b> Mola mola, being with a weight of up to two tonnes an order of magnitude smaller than Leedsichthys. The extant King of Herrings might rival Leedsichthys in length but is a much more elongated animal. The lack of a preserved vertebral column has made it difficult to estimate the exact length of Leedsichthys. Arthur Smith Woodward, who described the type specimen in 1889, estimated specimen BMNH P.10000 to be of an around nine metre long individual, by comparing this tail of Leedsichthys, having a preserved height of 274 centimetres (108 inches), with another pachycormid, Hypsocormus. The length of Leedsichthys was not historically the subject of much attention, the only reference to it being made by Woodward himself when he in 1937 indicated it again as 9 metres (29.5 feet) on the museum label of BMNH P.10000. However, in 1986, David Martill compared the bones of Leedsichthys to a pachycormid that he had recently discovered, Asthenocormus. The unusual proportions of that specimen gave a wide range of possible sizes. Some were as low as 13.5 metres (44.3 feet), but extrapolating from the gill basket resulted in an estimated length of 27.6 metres (90.6 feet) for Leedsichthys specimen NHM P.10156 (the earlier BMNH P.10156). Martill considered the higher estimate as a plausible size of the largest individuals. Subsequently, a length of thirty metres (hundred feet) was often mentioned in popular science publications, sometimes one as high as thirty-five metres (115 feet).|$|E
