40|$|A simple, {{rapid and}} {{low-cost}} method using capillary electrophoresis coupled with field-amplified sample stacking and electrochemical detection {{was developed for}} the separation and determination of monoamines. In this present work, a systematic study of the parameters (pH value and concentration of electrophoretic buffer, composition of sample solvent, injection voltage and time) affecting separation and on-line concentration of monoamines has been performed enabling the detection sensitivity of these monoamines to be improved by 5000 times compared with the conventional electrokinetic injection. This developed method {{was applied to the}} direct analysis of these monoamines in human urine without <b>off-line</b> sample <b>preconcentration.</b> Due to the requirement for urine dilution to minimize the detrimental effects of high salt on analyte stacking, the real sensitivity improvement is about 50 -fold when applying the optimized method to urine samples. In order to quantitate these monoamines accurately, internal standard calibration curves were constructed with standard monoamines in presence of salt with similar concentration as in human urine. In the method validation, the calibration curves were linear over a range of 1. 0 x 10 (- 9) to 2. 5 x 10 (- 8) mol/L for each monoamine and the limits of detection (signal to noise ratio of 3) for these monoamines were in the sub-nmol/L concentration range (6. 0 x 10 (- 10) mol/L).

The PAEs was preconcentrated on Saccharomyces cerevisiae immobilized on silica gel and then determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Several parameters on {{the recovery of the}} analytes were investigated. Recoveries of BBP, DBP and DCHP were 100 ± 2, 98 ± 2 and 98 ± 3 %, respectively, at 95 % confidence level under optimum conditions.

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThe {{estimated}} {{concentrations of}} the rare earth elements (REE) in drinking water vary between 0. 3 ng/l for Lu and 130 ng/l for Ce. Sc, Y, La, Ce and Eu may be determined without preconcentration; the other REE need a 50 - 100 x preconcentration. This report describes several <b>off-line</b> <b>preconcentration</b> methods like precipitation, extraction and column chromatography. On-line preconcentration with an automated extraction system offers advantages like quick sample analysis (about 4 min), minimal sample handling and minimal contamination. The REE determination by ICP-MS suffers from REE oxide spectral interferences. These oxide levels can be minimized by optimizing the instrumental parameters. The best isotope choice is: 45 Sc, 89 Y, 139 La, 140 Ce, 141 Pr, 143 Nd, 147 Sm or 149 Sm, 151 Eu, 157 Gd, 159 Tb, 163 Dy, 165 Ho, 167 Er, 169 Tm, 171 Yb and 175 Lu. 115 In {{can be used as}} an internal standard for sensitivity, 248 ThO/ 232 Th can be used as an internal standard for the MO/M ratio.

40|$|An iminodiacetate {{chelating}} resin was optimised for {{the rapid}} determination of Co, Cu, Fe, Mn and Ni in seawater. Using inexpensive, high-capacity, reusable cartridges allowed high flow rates {{of up to}} 25 ml min(- 1). High preconcentration factors, of up to 500, were obtained in order to analyse samples using an ICP-OES. The requirement for a buffer was eliminated due to the high tolerance of the ICP-OES to interfering matrix elements, thereby further reducing the potential for contamination. Quantification limits in seawater were: Co = 6 ng l(- 1), Cu = 8 ng l(- 1), Fe = 6 ng l(- 1), Mn = 5 ng l(- 1) and Ni = 6 ng l(- 1). The method was verified by the analysis of near shore seawater (CASS- 4) and open ocean seawater (NASS- 5) reference materials.

40|$|Inductively coupled plasma-mass {{spectrometry}} (ICP-MS) offers exceptional {{sensitivity and}} multi-element capability for trace metal analysis but {{the formation of}} polyatomic ions (particularly below m/z = 80) can cause, serious interferences. Such species can be introduced via precursor atoms in atmospheric gases, the sample matrix or impurities in the argon support gas. This thesis describes {{the development of a}} portfolio of analytical methods coupled with ICP-MS detection for the determination of trace metals such as manganese, cobalt, copper, nickel, zinc, mercury and lead in complex matrices such as sea water. A literature review of coupled techniques is given in Chapter one. Chapter two discusses the effect of sea water on the analytical performance of ICP-MS. Initial studies were carried out using a single channel flow injection (FI) manifold and included an investigation of the addition of nitrogen to the nebulizer gas flow of the ICPMS for the reduction of the ArNa* polyatomic ion interference at m/z = 63 on the Cu signal. This was followed by a multivariate simplex optimisation for the suppression of the ArNa* polyatomic ion interference at m/z = 63 and non-spectroscopic interferences affecting other masses in sea water, for the determination of Cu, Cr, Mn, Ni, Co, Zn and Pb. In Chapter three an on-line FI-ICP-MS matrix elimination method for the determination of trace metals such as Mn, Co, Cu, Zn and Pb in sea water is discussed. The method involved chelation of the analytes onto Chelex- 100 or MetPac CC- 1 iminodiacetate (IDA). resin, with the simultaneous removal of indirectly interfering matrix species, particularly Na and CI ions. Results showing how the effects of the interferences were overcome, together with validation of the method by the analysis of open ocean, coastal and estuarine certified reference materials are reported. s Chapter four compares FI approaches coupled with AFS, ICP-AES and ICP-MS detectors for the determination of total mercury. Initial studies compared figures of merit for FI (conventional pneumatic nebulization) and Fl-cold vapour generation (CVG) coupled with ICP-AES and ICP-MS. Detection limits for total Hg were improved by developing simple on- and <b>off-line</b> <b>preconcentration</b> procedures using a MetPac CC- 1 micro-column incorporated in a FI manifold vAth conventional pneumatic nebulization. An AFS detector was then used {{in the development of a}} method for the determination of total mercury with an on-line bromide/bromate oxidation step.

The utilized chelating resin was NOBIAS Chelate-PA 1 (Hitachi High-Technologies) with ethylenediaminetriacetic acid and iminodiacetic acid functional groups. Parts of the 8 -way valve made of alumina and zirconia in the original SPE- 100 system were replaced with parts made of polychlorotrifluoroethylene {{in order to reduce}} contamination of trace metals. The eluent pass was altered for the back flush elution of trace metals. We optimized the cleaning procedures for the chelating resin column and flow lines of the preconcentration system, and developed a preconcentration procedure, which required less labor and led to a superior performance compared to manual preconcentration (Sohrin et al.). The nine trace metals were simultaneously and quantitatively preconcentrated from ∼ 120 g of seawater, eluted with ∼ 15 g of 1 M HNO 3, and determined by HR-ICP-MS using the calibration curve method. The single-step preconcentration removed more than 99. 998 % of Na, K, Mg, Ca, and Sr from seawater. The procedural blanks and detection limits were lower than the lowest concentrations in seawater for Mn, Ni, Cu, and Pb, while they were as low as the lowest concentrations in seawater for Al, Fe, Co, Zn, and Cd.
