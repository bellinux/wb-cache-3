The main goal of the present study was to examine the effect of the <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> (formal vs. informal) used in a résumé on the hirability perceptions formed by professional recruiters (N= 73). In addition, the effect of the <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> on hirability perceptions was compared to the effects of spelling errors and typeface. Participants assessed the cognitive ability, personality, and the hirability of six fictitious applicants for the job of an HR specialist. The hirability ratings for the résumés with informal <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> <b>were</b> significantly lower than the hirability ratings for résumés that featured a formal <b>e-mail</b> <b>address.</b> The effect of <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> <b>was</b> as strong as the effect of spelling errors and stronger than that of typeface. The effect of <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> on hirability <b>was</b> mediated by perceptions of conscientiousness and honesty-humility. This study among actual recruiters shows for the first time that the choice of the <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> used on a résumé might make a real difference...|$|R

50|$|A {{directory}} harvest attack (DHA) is {{a technique}} used by spammers {{in an attempt to}} find valid/existent <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> at a domain by using brute force. The attack is usually carried out by way of a standard dictionary attack, where valid <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> found by brute force guessing valid <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> at a domain using different permutations of common usernames. These attacks are more effective for finding <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> of companies since they are likely to have a standard format for official e-mail aliases (i.e. jdoe@example.domain, johnd@example.domain, or johndoe@example.domain).|$|R
