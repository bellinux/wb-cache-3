5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that an opportunity was lost on 5 August to encircle and capture the invading Austrian, German and Ottoman force when it was allowed to withdraw to Katia. The infantry's difficulties regarding the supply of water and camel transport combined with their lack of desert training, together with Lawrence's confusing orders for infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division to move south and east, stopped them from promptly advancing to cut off the retreating force {{in the early hours of}} the second day's battle. General Lawrence was criticised for taking a grave and unnecessary risk by relying <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> entrenched infantry division and two light horse brigades to defend Romani. That the strong enemy attack on the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades during the first night's battle pushed them so far back that the planned flanking attack by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade became almost a frontal attack. Lawrence was also faulted for remaining at his headquarters at Kantara, which was considered to be too far from the battlefield, and that this contributed to his loss of control of the battle during the first day, when the telephone line was cut and he was out of contact with Romani. Lawrence was also criticised for not going forward to supervise the execution of his orders on 5 August, when there was a failure to coordinate the movements of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and the Mobile Column.|$|E

25|$|The Australian, New Zealand, and European Union {{national}} nutrition bodies note {{there have}} been no reports of choline deficiency in the general population.

The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) notes that these figures are based <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> study and that there was little data and the choline made by the body (assuming a dietary intake of zero) may be enough for some groups. Australia, New Zealand and Canada use the figures published by the US IOM. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published its own Adequate Intake values, most recently in 2016. For U.S. dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV) based on the AI. For choline, as shown in Reference Daily Intake, 100% of the Daily Value is 550mg.|$|E
25|$|Commons {{began the}} 2009–10 season {{alongside}} Hulse as Derby beat Peterborough United 2–1. Commons grabbed his {{first of the}} season in the following match, as Derby lost 3–2 away to Scunthorpe United but, once again, injury curtailed Commons productivity as he appeared in just one match between 20 October and 2 January, a 0–0 draw away to eventual champions Newcastle United, where he came on as a 69th-minute substitute. An extended run in the first team followed and Commons once again approached his best from and helped revive Derby's stuttering campaign and dragged them away from the relegation zone, netting in a 3–0 home win over Newcastle and a 5–3 victory over Preston North End, as well as providing the assist for Rob Hulse's winner as Derby beat Nottingham Forest 1–0 and ended their rivals' 19 match unbeaten streak. However, an injury sustained {{in the first half of}} a 1–0 home defeat to Swansea City on 20 February ruled Commons out until the final game of the season, against Cardiff City on 2 May, as Derby avoided relegation for the second time in two seasons. Commons completed a full 90 minutes <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> occasion and managed just 11 league starts and a further nine substitute appearances, scoring three times.|$|E

500|$|Pratchett {{originally}} {{wanted the}} game {{to be based on}} The Colour of Magic and for the team to work in succession through the series, but Barnett believed that would be detrimental, and thought that it was difficult to make a game based <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> book. He explained that they wanted to licence all of Discworld. An original story was made, taking elements from various Discworld books, particularly The Colour of Magic and Guards! Guards!. Barnett stated that the team had [...] "effectively written a complete film script for the game". The game introduced a new character: a practising psychiatrist (known as the psychatrickerist). Pratchett initially objected to this, but later added his input, and the character became a retro-phrenologist. Barnett stated that he wanted to create Discworld as a flagship game for CD-based systems, and thought the Discworld licence was [...] "100% suited".|$|E

Due to the demands on the actors' schedules, some episodes of the fifth season focused <b>on</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> of the two leads.
