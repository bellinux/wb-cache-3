50|$|The {{availability}} of cheap steel allowed building larger bridges, railroads, skyscrapers, and ships. Other important steel products—also made using the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> process—were <b>steel</b> cable, steel rod and sheet steel which enabled large, high-pressure boilers and high-tensile strength steel for machinery which enabled {{much more powerful}} engines, gears and axles than were previously possible. With large amounts of steel it became possible to build much more powerful guns and carriages, tanks, armored fighting vehicles and naval ships.|$|R
50|$|The lower 1.5 mi of {{the river}} south of Michigan Avenue were channelized, widened, and dredged to allow {{freighter}} access to Ford's River Rouge Plant inland factory facilities. The plant was built between 1915 and 1927, when {{it was the first}} manufacturing facility for automobiles that included within the plant virtually everything needed to produce the cars: blast furnaces, an <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> mill, a <b>steel</b> rolling mill, a glass plant, a huge power plant and an assembly line.|$|R
5000|$|For {{several years}} after the {{introduction}} of Bessemer and <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>steel,</b> there were different opinions as to what differentiated iron from steel; some believed it was the chemical composition and others that it was whether the iron heated sufficiently to melt and [...] "fuse". Fusion eventually became generally accepted as relatively more important than composition below a given low carbon concentration. [...] Another difference is that steel can be hardened by heat treating.|$|E
50|$|The Great Deflation {{occurred}} {{at the beginning of}} the period sometimes called the Second Industrial Revolution. It was characterized by dramatic increases in productivity made possible by the transition from agriculture to industrialization in the leading economies. The new leading industries were Bessemer and <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>steel,</b> railroads, the machinery industry, efficient steam shipping and animal powered agricultural mechanization. The prices of most basic commodities fell almost continuously; however, wages remained steady. Goods produced by craftsmen, as opposed to in factories, did not decrease in cost.|$|E
5000|$|In 1946 {{steel plate}} rolling ended. In 1953 the 11 in {{continuous}} bar mill was completed, {{which was to}} roll both straight and coiled bar. In 1963 the new site covered some 370 acre and the Roundwood site, beside the Midland Main Line north of the main works, and covering another 220 acre was starting production. The plant then included two mechanically-charged blast furnaces feeding 10 <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>steel</b> making furnaces which, in turn, fed two primary mills for rolling blooms and billets and six finishing mills rolling {{a wide range of}} blooms, billets, slabs, sections, bars and strip. The Roundwood site had an 11" [...] continuous bar mill and a narrow hot strip mill. Capacity at the time was about 425,000 tons of carbon, low alloy, and free-cutting steel and ingots.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevated}} steel highway of the 125th Street viaduct, {{called the}} Riverside Drive Viaduct, between Tiemann Place and 135th Street and rising over Twelfth Avenue, is shouldered by masonry approaches. The viaduct proper {{was made of}} <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> medium <b>steel,</b> comprising twenty-six spans, or bays, whose hypnotic repetition is much appreciated from underneath at street level. The south and north approaches are of rock-faced Mohawk Valley limestone with Maine granite trimmings, the face work being of coursed ashlar. The girders over Manhattan Street (now 125th Street) were the largest ever built at the time. The broad plaza effect of the south approach was designed to impart deliberate grandeur to the natural terminus of much of Riverside Drive's traffic {{as well as to}} give full advantage to the vista overlooking the Hudson River and New Jersey Palisades to the west.|$|R
50|$|Hunedoara was {{the leading}} Romanian {{producer}} of long steel profiles, made in two electric arc furnaces. The first, with a capacity of 150,000 tons per year, two 50-ton furnaces and two 20-ton ones for alloyed steels shaped into ingots, featured vacuum degasification and electro-slag remelting. The second, turning out up to 400,000 tons a year, had two 100-ton secondary treatment furnaces with a continuous turning mechanism and eccentric bottom tap-holes. There were also two <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace <b>steel</b> mills. The first had five 100-ton ovens with an annual capacity of 300,000 tons a year, and a rolling mill for up to 450,000 tons of light profiles a year, used for making special products. The second Siemens-Martin steel mill had a production capacity of some 3.2 million tons per year and a rolling plant for light profiles (440,000 tons a year), heavy profiles (1,130,000 tons a year) and wire (280,000 tons a year). Stainless steel for bearings was also produced.|$|R

50|$|The {{location}} of the Sharon Steel Hoop Company being immediately adjacent to the Sharon Steel Company, later the Farrell Works of the Carnegie Steel Company, made it feasible for the new company to purchase its requirements of semi-finished steel from the mill located so near. When the original Sharon Steel Company was acquired later by the United States Steel Corporation, and a new contract for billets could not be negotiated, it became necessary for the Sharon Steel Hoop Company to produce its own <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>steel.</b> Thus, in 1902, the “Steel Hoop” inaugurated a building program which included four 35-ton open hearth furnaces, a blooming mill, and a bar mill on which billets would be rolled to be converted into bands on the 8” and 9” mills. In 1905, a fifth open hearth furnace was added, and a 10” hot strip mill was brought into production, In 1906, the company built and operated the first continuous pickling and galvanizing unit ever built in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Commonwealth set the {{standard}} for innovation. In 1908, the company cast the first one-piece rectangular tender frame and overcame problems producing castings of up to 80 ft long after developing special machining equipment. During World War I, the company produced cast steel frames for gun tractors and locomotive castings. The company grew and by 1913 the company’s payroll exceeded $110,000 ($2,420,000 in 2010 dollars) for each pay period.In 1924, the company finished the design and manufactured a one-piece underframe structure, or bed, for a steam locomotive and delivered it to the New York Central Railroad. [...] Also in 1924, the company embarked on a $1,500,000 ($33 million in 2010 dollars) expansion that included increasing the size of the foundry to a total length of 1475 ft making it [...] "probably the largest <b>Open</b> <b>Hearth</b> <b>steel</b> foundry building in the world", increased plant capacity by 35%, and was producing the [...] "largest steel castings in the world." [...] The Commonwealth plant also grew to cover 75 acre.|$|E

When initially completed in 1916, the steel plant site alone had 48 buildings listed, {{the size of a}} small community.|$|E
50|$|In 1896 {{the company}} began {{stamping}} sheet metal, and in 1900 the plant expanded to include a Martin process hearth (7 tonnes capacity), and facilities to forge wheels; the plant had three activities: forging, machining, and stamping. The company continued to expand in the 1900s; with orders from the Compagnie du Midi for high capacity wagons, and a large order from the Compagnie du Nord the business acquired 3 more hectares of land in Douai to build a second plant in 1908 specialising in railway vehicles. Parts for artillery pieces, and other military equipment began to be produced around this time in Douai. In 1910 a third plant was opened which included an <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace, a <b>steel</b> plate mill and other equipment for the working of steel.|$|R
50|$|The {{steel making}} plant was changed in 1897 when the Bessemer {{converters}} {{were replaced by}} three <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnaces and the processing plant increased {{with the addition of}} cogging mills, rail mills and specialist plant for the manufacture of steel springs and railway axles. In 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War many iron and steel companies began producing munitions. In this case the work was added to the normal production, which included many component orders for the military. The Ickles site was proving too small to handle the production, and with steel in such demand, the company extended their works towards the Sheffield boundary, to occupy a site between the main Sheffield to Rotherham road and the Great Central Railway line. The new Melting Shop and Rolling Mills were built over the site of the old Roman fort at Templeborough. The Templeborough Melting Shop, when opened, was the largest melting shop of its type in Europe and contained 14 <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnaces where <b>steel</b> scrap was melted down.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{producing}} only iron, {{the enterprise}} began {{the production of}} steel in 1886. Over the ensuing 60 years, the company expanded its facilities and its operations along {{both sides of the}} Monongahela River and along the Ohio River. The Hot Metal Bridge across the Monongahela River was built to connect the blast furnaces (making pig iron) {{on one side of the}} river with the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnaces (making <b>steel)</b> on the other side of the river. In 1905, a new plant was begun at Aliquippa, Pennsylvania. The company also owned coal mines in western Pennsylvania in its early days, including some reached by an incline in Pittsburgh's South Side which connected to the railroad over the bridge adjacent to the Hot Metal Bridge. Other mines were along the nearby Becks Run, also directly connected by railroad. The incline and mines were gone before 1900, but mining continued in Pennsylvania towns such as Vestaburg and elsewhere. The former Otis Steel company along the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland was purchased in 1942, and then in the mid-1960s a finishing plant was constructed in Hennepin, Illinois.|$|R
50|$|In 1860 {{partners}} in B. Hick and Son, John Hick and William Hargreaves joined Thomas Lever Rushton's brother-in-law Henry Sharp as {{partners in}} Sharp and Eckersley, formerly Rushton and Eckersley before Rushton's retirement {{from the firm}} in 1859. The three partners Sharp, Hick and Hargreaves formed the Bolton Iron & Steel Company; situated next door to Rothwell's Union Foundry (now Bolton bus station) the company supplied basic metals required by the major manufacturers in the area. Bessemer steel making began about 1860 - four six-ton Bessemer converters were installed during the 1860s, and experiments with the Sieman's open-hearth process began in 1867. Rolling, casting and forging equipment was installed, its products included steel deck beams for ships and sheet metal for shovels, during 1865 Bolton Iron & Steel cast the largest anvil block made in England, weighing 210 tons. By 1869 the company was making <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>steel</b> and manufacturing steam hammers {{to the design of}} Francis Webb. Hick's nephew became a shareholder following incorporation on 9 June 1876.|$|E
50|$|In 1896, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited had {{acquired}} {{land on the}} river shore at Mayfield East for smelters, and in 1910 {{it was decided that}} they would construct here a major steel works and foundries, with a 350-ton blast furnace and three 65-ton <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>steel</b> furnaces, a bloom mill and heavy rail mill, with by-product coke ovens to supply coke for the blast furnaces. The advantages of the site played a major part in this decision: for transport both rail and shipping already existed, and they had close proximity to the Newcastle and South Maitland coalfields, (the coal consumption in 1947 was 30,000 tons each week). The task of reclaiming swampland at Port Waratah for the main site began in January 1913, and the New South Wales Government undertook to dredge and maintain a river channel between the works and the sea, 500 ft wide and 25 ft deep at low water to the steelwork's basin and wharves. Altogether the company acquired 1225 acre. The blast furnace commenced operations in March 1915.|$|E
5000|$|The {{junction}} is sited {{within a}} heavy industrial area. Although the coal mines (Aldwarke and Roundwood collieries were {{adjacent to the}} junction) have closed, the last in 1964, the Parkgate Iron and Steel Company invested heavily in the mid-1960s {{in the development of}} a new site alongside the GC with rail access. Nowadays the site is owned by Corus and comprises not just the Aldwarke (new site) melting and steel processing but was developed further with the opening of the Thrybergh Bar Mill in 1976. At the north end of the junction, adjacent to the North Midland line, and rail connected to it, is situated the just post-war, and now closed, Roundwood Rolling Mill (commonly known because of the size of the mill as the [...] "11 inch mill"). However, the former blast furnace and <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>steel</b> melting plant to the rear of Parkgate and Rawmarsh station are gone, replaced by large retail parks. The road names, however, reflect the railway theme, although most not from the railways of this area. (Note: The nearby [...] "Great Eastern Way" [...] is, in fact, named after the Isambard Kingdom Brunel ship of the same name; the metal plates for its construction being produced at the Parkgate Iron and Steel Company).|$|E
50|$|Basic oxygen {{steelmaking}} eventually {{replaced the}} <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace. It rapidly superseded both the Bessemer process and Siemens-Martin process in Western Europe by the 1950s and in Eastern Europe by the 1980s. The <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> steelmaking had superseded Bessemer process in UK by 1900, but elsewhere in Europe, especially in Germany, the Bessemer and Thomas processes were used {{until the late}} 1960s when they were superseded by basic oxygen steelmaking. The last <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace in the former East Germany was stopped in 1993. In the US, steel production using the Bessemer process ended in 1968 and the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnaces had stopped by 1992. In Hunedoara steel works, Romania the last 420-tonne capacity <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace was shut down on 12 June 1999, demolished and scrapped between 2001 and 2003, but the eight smokestacks of the furnaces remained until February 2011. The last <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> shop in China was shut down in 2001. The nation with the highest share of <b>steel</b> produced with <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnaces (almost 50%) is Ukraine.

50|$|The AJAX furnace was a {{modification}} of the tilting <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace that used blown oxygen to improve productivity. The process {{was used in the}} UK during the 1960s at a time of transition from <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> to oxygen based steel making.|$|R
50|$|The {{successor}} to Mr. Bachman was Mr. Severn P. Ker, who had {{many years of}} experience in the commercial side of the steel industry. Under Mr. Ker's direction, the company continued to increase its capacity and to extend its operations. In 1910, a sixth <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace was built, and a 14” band mill was added to the production line. In 1913, another <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace and certain auxiliary equipment were added, which raised the annual capacity of the company to 180,000 tons of <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> ingots.|$|R
5000|$|George Merrick Rice {{was born}} in West Brookfield, Massachusetts on 20 Nov 1808 to Col. Samuel Buckminster Rice and Abigail (Bradish) Rice. [...] He {{attended}} public schools in West Brookfield, and after serving as a clerk {{for a few years}} in a country store in Leicester, Massachusetts, he moved to Worcester in 1829 and became a partner in the dry goods firm Andrew, March and Company. Shortly afterwards, he purchased the dry goods business of Burt and Merrick in 1830 and a few years later he purchased a flour and grain store near the end the Blackstone Canal in Worcester. In 1846, he became a partner in the firm of Howe, Goddard and Company (H.P. Howe and Isaac Goddard) in the manufacture of calico printing and bleaching machinery. This company eventually became the Rice, Barton, and Fales Machinery and Iron Company. [...] He became the president of the Worcester Steel Works in 1882, installing a Bessemer steel plant in 1884, with expanded operations producing as much as 230 tons of steel per day after addition of an <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>steel</b> furnace. The business operated for 30 years in Worcester {{and was one of the}} largest businesses in the city. He also served as president of the Worcester Safe Deposit and Trust Company and president of the Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, U. S. steel {{producers}} have replaced their aging <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>steel</b> furnaces with basic oxygen (BOF) or large electric are furnaces (LEF). This choice of technology creates {{the opportunity to}} substitute electricity for fossil fuels. We extend earlier research to investigate whether energy prices affect this type of technology adoption. The econometric model uses the "seemingly unrelated Tobit" method to capture {{the effects of the}} industry's experience with both technologies, technical change, and potential cost reductions, as well as energy prices, on adoption. Men we include the prices of electricity and coking coal as explanatory variables, the four energy price coefficients have the signs predicted by the law of demand, but the magnitude of the coefficients is such that the non-price terms are more important, e. g. a 50 % increase in electricity prices would delay LEF adoption by only 12 days. Our results suggest that the adoption of LEF represents a form of major process technical change (factor biased - electricity using), rather than a price-induced technological innovation. ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1975, {{beginning}} with the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> building, U.S. <b>Steel</b> began to demolish much of the massive structures that dotted the 1600 acre sites and began preparing the industrial park for future development. In 1984, following an inspection by the Pollution Control Agency, the former Duluth Works steel plant site {{was put on the}} National Priorities List for the federally funded [...] "superfund" [...] program. Areas of heavy pollution were found on the site and were required to be cleaned up by U.S. Steel. This process has been ongoing since that time, but the site still has areas of concern by residents, future developers and pollution and environmental agencies. The city of Duluth has recently purchased the cement plant site and is developing that 65 acre area through its Duluth Economic and Development Authority (DEDA), although U.S. Steel still owns the 640 acre former Duluth Works land. In April 2008 the Duluth-based photographic enhancement company, Ikonics, announced it would develop 40 acre on the property to build a warehouse and, later, move its West Duluth headquarters operations to Morgan Park at the former Atlas Cement plant site. Development at the long vacant site will begin once again. On February 5, 2009 the State of Minnesota awarded the Duluth Port Authority a $50, 000 investigative grant to determine the feasibility of re-developing 123 acre of the former steel plant site as a 35000 sq ft warehouse and light industrial park for storage of energy creating windmills. The investigation is ongoing. On February 9, 2011 State Senator Roger Reinert sent a message proposal to Governor Mark Dayton suggesting the placement of the Minnesota Vikings stadium at the Duluth Works site.|$|R
