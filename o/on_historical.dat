5|$|Candide is characterised by its sarcastic tone {{as well as}} by its erratic, fantastical and {{fast-moving}} plot. A picaresque novel with a story {{similar to}} that of a more serious coming-of-age narrative (Bildungsroman), it parodies many adventure and romance clichés, the struggles of which are caricatured in a tone that is mordantly matter-of-fact. Still, the events discussed are often based <b>on</b> <b>historical</b> happenings, such as the Seven Years' War and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. As philosophers of Voltaire's day contended with the problem of evil, so too does Candide in this short novel, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers through allegory; most conspicuously, he assaults Leibniz and his optimism.|$|E

5|$|Dinner by Heston Blumenthal is a {{restaurant}} in London, England. Opened in January 2011, it gained a Michelin star within a year, and in April 2014 was listed fifth on The World's 50 Best Restaurants in Restaurant magazine. It received a second Michelin Star in the 2014 Guide. The restaurant is headed by former Fat Duck head chef Ashley Palmer-Watts. Menu options are based <b>on</b> <b>historical</b> British dishes, which were researched by food historians and through the British Library. The restaurant's opening drew interest within the industry, and reviews have been positive. Particular dishes have received praise, including the meat fruit, a chicken liver mousse created {{to look like a}} mandarin orange.|$|E

In this, he is relying on visual clues derived from his inner life, rather than anything that could be recognised from real events or settings.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the largely alignment-oriented statistically led methods of Green archaeoastronomy, Brown archaeoastronomy {{has been identified as}} being closer to the history of astronomy or to cultural history, insofar as it draws <b>on</b> <b>historical</b> and ethnographic records to enrich its understanding of early astronomies and their relations to calendars and ritual. The many records of native customs and beliefs made by the Spanish chroniclers means that Brown archaeoastronomy is most often associated with studies of astronomy in the Americas.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, recessions {{frequently}} {{coincided with}} financial crises. Determining {{the occurrence of}} pre-20th-century recessions is more difficult due to the dearth of economic statistics, so scholars rely <b>on</b> <b>historical</b> accounts of economic activity, such as contemporary newspapers or business ledgers. Although the NBER does not date recessions before 1857, economists customarily extrapolate dates of U.S. recessions back to 1790 from business annals based on various contemporary descriptions. Their work is aided by historical patterns, in that recessions often follow external shocks to the economic system such as wars and variations in the weather affecting agriculture, as well as banking crises.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Heathen organisations {{emerged in the}} United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Iceland, largely {{independently}} from each other. This has been partly attributed to the wider growth of the modern Pagan movement during the 1960s and 1970s, {{as well as the}} development of the New Age milieu, both of which encouraged the establishment of new religious movements intent on reviving pre-Christian belief systems. Further Heathen groups then emerged in the 1990s and 2000s, many of which distanced themselves from overtly political agendas and placed a stronger emphasis <b>on</b> <b>historical</b> authenticity than their 1960s and 1970s forebears.|$|E

5|$|Sanders {{says that}} the genealogies of Jesus are based not <b>on</b> <b>historical</b> {{information}} but on the authors' desire to show that Jesus was the universal Jewish savior.

Several theories have sought to explain the demise of the Mary Rose, based <b>on</b> <b>historical</b> records, knowledge of 16th-century shipbuilding, and modern experiments. The precise cause of her sinking is still unclear, because of conflicting testimonies and a lack of conclusive physical evidence.|$|E
