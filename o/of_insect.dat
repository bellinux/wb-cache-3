500|$|Academically, the {{interaction}} <b>of</b> <b>insects</b> and {{society has been}} treated in part as cultural entomology, dealing mostly with [...] "advanced" [...] societies, and in part as ethnoentomology, dealing mostly with [...] "primitive" [...] societies, though the distinction is weak and not based on theory. Both academic disciplines explore the parallels, connections and influence <b>of</b> <b>insects</b> on human populations, and vice versa. They are rooted in anthropology and natural history, as well as entomology, the study <b>of</b> <b>insects.</b> Other cultural uses <b>of</b> <b>insects,</b> such as biomimicry, do not necessarily lie within these academic disciplines.|$|R
5|$|A {{large number}} of insects live either part or the whole of their lives underwater. In {{many of the more}} {{primitive}} orders <b>of</b> <b>insect,</b> the immature stages are spent in an aquatic environment. Some groups of insects, like certain water beetles, have aquatic adults as well.|$|E
5|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>insect</b> pests infest stored dry {{foods such}} as flour, cereals and pasta; these include the Indian mealmoth, the {{cigarette}} beetle, the drugstore beetle, the confused flour beetle, the red flour beetle, the merchant grain beetle, the sawtoothed grain beetle, the wheat weevil, the maize weevil and the rice weevil.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine-derived melanin {{probably}} {{appears in}} at least some other biological systems as well. Some of the dopamine in plants is likely {{to be used as a}} precursor for dopamine-melanin. The complex patterns that appear on butterfly wings, as well as black-and-white stripes on the bodies <b>of</b> <b>insect</b> larvae, are also thought to be caused by spatially structured accumulations of dopamine-melanin.|$|E

5|$|E. eastwoodiae, E. nelsonii, E. rupestris, and E. verbenacea {{are also}} pollinated by hummingbirds. These four species {{as well as}} E. cardinalis and E. nelsonii produce {{bisexual}} flowers and are self-compatible. This approximate ratio <b>of</b> <b>insect</b> vs hummingbird pollination holds true {{for the rest of}} the genus. There have been two separate transformations to hummingbird pollination. Pollination changes are highly affected by changes in flower morphology. E. cardinalis and its sister species E. cinnabarina likely evolved via allopatric speciation.|$|E
5|$|Helpers, {{offspring}} {{from the}} previous brood, have sometimes been noted to assist in feeding the fledglings at the nest of their parents. Cases of brood parasitism by the Asian koel have been noted. An average breeding success of 44% has been noted with {{the main cause of}} fledgling mortality being shortage <b>of</b> <b>insect</b> food which in turn was dependent on rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Kincaid missed {{commencement}} exercises at the University of Washington due to {{his appointment}} as the entomologist attached to the Harriman Alaska Expedition. During that trip, completed before his 27th birthday, he collected about 8,000 specimens <b>of</b> <b>insect,</b> resulting in the discovery and naming of more than 240 new species, including Mesenchytraeus harrimani, which he named after the expedition's patron, E. H. Harriman.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{approaches}} to the conservation <b>of</b> <b>insects.</b> Either humans set aside large portions of land using [...] "wilderness preservation" [...] as the motive, or confronting the particular processes that affect the charismatic vertebrates {{in order to achieve}} indirect conservation <b>of</b> <b>insects.</b> With biodiversity loss being a global problem, conserving habitat simply for species <b>of</b> <b>insects</b> is <b>of</b> low priority in the current environmental culture.|$|R
25|$|The {{anthropologist}} Marvin Harris {{has suggested}} that the eating <b>of</b> <b>insects</b> is taboo in cultures that have other protein sources which require less work to obtain, such as poultry or cattle, though there are cultures which feature both animal husbandry and entomophagy. Examples can be found in Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe where strong cattle-raising traditions co-exist with entomophagy <b>of</b> <b>insects</b> like the mopane worm. In addition, people in cultures where entomophagy is common are not indiscriminate in their choice <b>of</b> <b>insects,</b> as Thai consumers <b>of</b> <b>insects</b> perceive edible insects not consumed within their culture in a similar way as Western consumers.|$|R

5|$|Many {{species of}} tree support their own {{specialised}} invertebrates. In their natural habitats, 284 different species <b>of</b> <b>insect</b> {{have been found}} on the English oak (Quercus robur) and 306 species of invertebrate on the Tasmanian oak (Eucalyptus obliqua). Non-native tree species provide a less biodiverse community, for example in the United Kingdom the sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), which originates from southern Europe, has few associated invertebrate species, though its bark supports {{a wide range of}} lichens, bryophytes and other epiphytes.|$|E
5|$|Some earwig {{specimen}} fossils {{are in the}} extinct suborders Archidermaptera or Eodermaptera, {{the former}} dating to the Late Triassic and the latter to the Middle Jurassic.

5|$|Some plants {{mimic the}} {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>insect</b> eggs on their leaves, dissuading insect species from laying their eggs there. Because female butterflies {{are less likely}} to lay their eggs on plants that already have butterfly eggs, some species of neotropical vines of the genus Passiflora (Passion flowers) contain physical structures resembling the yellow eggs of Heliconius butterflies on their leaves, which discourage oviposition by butterflies.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of artificial cooling associated with the use of diatomaceous earth to control <b>insects</b> in grains <b>of</b> wheat stored in concrete silos. We used two concrete silos, with a static capacity of 2. 500 t (Silo A) and the other with static capacity of 5. 000 t (Silo B). The surface of the grain silos were treated with diatom earth with a commercial assay (1. 0 kg / t of product). For the cooling of the grains, cold air was blown through the aeration system silos until the grains reach a temperature of 17 ° C between the layers. After cooling, it is the retention period of five months. The monitoring <b>of</b> <b>insects</b> in the Silo A was accomplished by collecting infested grain and / or insects with probes. In Silo B, the monitoring was done through the capture <b>of</b> <b>insects</b> with traps <b>of</b> the type calador. In The Silo, were not detected representative quantities <b>of</b> <b>insects</b> in grain up to 120 days, when the collections were made with probes in the layer below the grain treated with diatomaceous earth. In Silo B, where the collection <b>of</b> <b>insects</b> was performed with traps of the type calador, increased population <b>of</b> <b>insects</b> <b>of</b> the species O. surinamensis and R. dominica with the extension of storage. This increase in the number <b>of</b> <b>insects</b> was greater after 60 days of the early experiments. This is happening due to the presence <b>of</b> <b>insects</b> in grain mass before cooling. The use of cooling associated with the inert powder has an effective control <b>of</b> <b>insects</b> in grain mass...|$|R

5|$|The bee-eaters {{are almost}} {{exclusively}} aerial hunters <b>of</b> <b>insect</b> prey. Prey is caught either in continuous flight or more commonly from an exposed perch {{from which the}} bee-eater watches for prey. Smaller, rounder-winged bee-eaters typically hunt from branches and twigs closer to the ground, whereas the larger species hunt from tree tops or telegraph wires. One unusual technique often used by carmine bee-eaters is to ride {{on the backs of}} bustards.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} <b>of</b> <b>insect</b> life {{provided some}} food for birds, and birds in turn helped many species to become established on the island. The bodies of dead birds provide sustenance for carnivorous insects, while the fertilisation {{of the soil}} and resulting promotion of plant life provides a viable habitat for herbivorous insects.|$|E
5|$|The origins <b>of</b> <b>insect</b> flight remain obscure, {{since the}} {{earliest}} winged insects currently known {{appear to have}} been capable fliers. Some extinct insects had an additional pair of winglets attaching to the first segment of the thorax, for a total of three pairs. As of 2009, no evidence suggests the insects were a particularly successful group of animals before they evolved to have wings.|$|E
50|$|New species {{described}} by Preysler include Claviger testaceus Preysler, 1790, Cheilosia rufipes Preysler, 1793,Aranea folium Preysler, 1791 and Chrysopilus asiliformis Preysler, 1791.

5|$|Insect {{mouthparts}} show {{many examples}} of convergent evolution. The mouthparts <b>of</b> different <b>insect</b> groups consist <b>of</b> a set of homologous organs, specialised for the dietary intake <b>of</b> that <b>insect</b> group. Convergent evolution of many groups <b>of</b> <b>insects</b> led from original biting-chewing mouthparts to different, more specialised, derived function types. These include, for example, the proboscis <b>of</b> flower-visiting <b>insects</b> such as bees and flower beetles, or the biting-sucking mouthparts <b>of</b> blood-sucking <b>insects</b> such as fleas and mosquitos.|$|R

5|$|The thorax, which {{develops}} from segments 2, 3 and 4 of the larva, {{consists of}} three invisibly divided segments, namely prothorax, metathorax and mesothorax. The organs <b>of</b> <b>insect</b> locomotion – the legs and wings – are borne on the thorax. The forelegs spring from the prothorax, the forewings and middle pair of legs are borne on the mesothorax, and the hindwings and hindlegs arise from the metathorax.

5|$|Ants first arose {{during the}} mid-Cretaceous, more than 100 million years ago, {{associated}} {{with the rise of}} flowering plants and an increase in forest ground litter. The earliest known ants evolved from a lineage within the aculeate wasps, and a recent study suggests that they are a sister group of Apoidea. During the Cretaceous ants were confined to the northern Laurasian supercontinent, with only a few widespread primitive species. By the middle Eocene, around 50 million years ago, ants had diversified and become ecologically dominant as predators and scavengers. Ant species are less than 2% of the total number <b>of</b> <b>insect</b> species but make up one third of the insect biomass.|$|E
