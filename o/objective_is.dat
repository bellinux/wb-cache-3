30|$|If the {{protection}} <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> not met when all active systems are working mitigating measures or adjustment of {{the protection}} <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> needed. This {{is due to}} the fact that the protection <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> not met in the most beneficial circumstances for the scenario, and will therefore never be met unless something is changed. One could come to the conclusion that other mitigating measures are needed, the protection <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> set to high or the scenario considered was to severe, whatever the cause the process needs to be reevaluated with a change in some of these factors.|$|R

40|$|The Instructional Objective Writing Assistant (IOWA) is {{a simple}} online {{knowledge-based}} system that serves to help instructors write good course <b>objectives.</b> Instructional <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> important {{for a number of}} different reasons and yet <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> often not written, written incorrectly, or incompletely written. Instructors can use IOWA to solve the problems of absent, incorrect and incomplete <b>objectives.</b> Most <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> incorrect in that they are usually written in a form that cannot be observed or measured, thus making it impossible {{to determine whether or not}} the <b>objectives</b> have <b>been</b> met. The IOWA web site contains instructions and suggestions on how to write <b>objectives</b> that <b>are</b> observable and measurable. A set of <b>objectives</b> <b>is</b> incomplete if it doesn't include objectives for all levels of thinking or if the <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> focused on levels of thinking that are not appropriate for the course. The knowledge-based system, which is written in Java and posted as an applet on the IOWA web site, can help to correct this problem. The program asks the instructor questions about the course for which <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> to be written and then returns a graph, based on the input of the instructor, that shows which levels of cognition should be focused on when writing objectives. The instructor then uses this graph, along with the suggestions, instructions, hints and examples provided on the rest of the web site, to write <b>objectives</b> that <b>are</b> correct and complete. This paper will present the motivation for creating IOWA, the knowledge upon which IOWA is based, how IOWA works, and initial results from the use of IOWA...|$|R
