Using a natural language depiction based free naming task, we explored how an <b>object’s</b> <b>function</b> and its history (information about how an object was formed by natural force) interact to affect categorization judgment in a 2 × 2 between- subjects experiment (N = 169). The study had two key findings: (i) Without presenting an <b>object’s</b> <b>function,</b> presenting the history of its natural formation increased subjects’ tendency to name the object under the “natural” domain and decreased their tendency to name it under the “artifact” domain; (ii) once we presented the depiction of an object’s function,the effect of history presentation on categorization disappeared: Subjects in both conditions strongly preferred naming objects as artifacts. In summary, presenting depiction of an <b>object’s</b> <b>function</b> inhibited the effect of history on object categorization.

50|$|Computer {{programming}} languages having {{notions of}} either functions {{as the core}} module (see Functional programming) or functions as objects provide excellent examples of loosely coupled programming. Functional languages have patterns of Continuations, Closure, or generators. See Clojure and Lisp as examples of function programming languages. Object-oriented languages like Smalltalk and Ruby have code blocks, whereas Eiffel has agents. The basic idea is to objectify (encapsulate as an object) a function independent of any other enclosing concept (e.g. decoupling an <b>object</b> <b>function</b> from any direct knowledge of the enclosing object). See First-class function for further insight into functions as objects, which qualifies as one form of first-class function.|$|E
5000|$|Through the positing of {{productive}} {{processes in the}} lexicon and the separation of structure and function, LFG is able to account for syntactic patterns {{without the use of}} transformations defined over syntactic structure. For example, in a sentence like What did you see?, where what is understood as the object of see, transformational grammar puts what after see (the usual position for objects) in [...] "deep structure", and then moves it. LFG analyzes what as having two functions: question-focus and object. It occupies the position associated in English with the question-focus function, and the constraints of the language allow it to take on the <b>object</b> <b>function</b> as well.|$|E

50|$|In principle, a good pivot {{strategy}} {{would be to}} select whichever variable has the greatest reduced cost. However, the steepest edge might ultimately {{not be the most}} attractive, as the edge might be very short, thus affording only a small betterment of the <b>object</b> <b>function</b> value. From a computational view, another problem is that to compute the steepest edge, an inner product must be computed for every variable in the system, making the computational cost too high in many cases. The Devex algorithm attempts to overcome the latter problem by estimating the reduced costs rather than calculating them at every pivot step, exploiting that a pivot step might not alter the reduced costs of all variables dramatically.|$|E
5000|$|Electron {{holography}} with high-energy electrons (80-200keV) can {{be realized}} in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) in an off-axis scheme. Electron beam is split into two parts by very thin positively charged wire. Positive voltage deflects the electron waves so that they overlap and produce an interference pattern of equidistantly spaced fringes. [...] Reconstruction of off-axis holograms is done numerically and it consists of two mathematical transformations. First, a Fourier transform of the hologram is performed. The resulting complex image consists of the autocorrelation (center band) and two mutually conjugated sidebands. Only one side band is selected by applying a low-pass filter (round mask) centered on the chosen side-band. The central band and the twin side-band are both set to zero. Next, the selected side-band is re-positioned {{to the center of}} the complex image and the backward Fourier-transform is applied. The resulting image in the object domain is complex-valued, and thus, the amplitude and phase distributions of the <b>object</b> <b>function</b> are reconstructed.|$|E
