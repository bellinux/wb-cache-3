50|$|<b>Owner</b> <b>representative</b> Richard Ravitch officially {{unveiled}} the ownership proposal on June 14, 1994. The proposal would guarantee a record $1 billion in salary and benefits. But the ownership proposal {{also would have}} forced clubs to fit their payrolls into a more evenly based structure. Salary arbitration would have been eliminated, free agency would begin after four years rather than six, and owners would have retained {{the right to keep}} a four or five year player by matching his best offer. Owners claimed that their proposal would raise average salaries from $1.2 million in 1994 to $2.6 million by 2001.|$|E

40|$|MBA thesisThe <b>owner’s</b> <b>representative</b> {{role has}} been {{identified}} as a means for project owners to improve the chances of success for their projects. Projects are an important means for mining companies to develop new resources or to extend the lives of their existing resources; however, little research has been performed into the <b>owner’s</b> <b>representative</b> role in the mining industry. The research objective was to describe the <b>owner’s</b> <b>representative</b> role in the South African mining industry, specifically in relation to the responsibilities of the <b>owner’s</b> <b>representative,</b> the characteristics, the owner’s organisation factors and the project factors impacting on the role. A list of propositions was developed, based on a literature review of the practice of the role in general industry. A survey was developed and tested on a sample of project professionals in the South African mining industry to test the propositions, as well as to determine the particular application of the role in the South African mining industry. It was found that that the responsibilities, characteristics and factors impacting on the role are similar to those in world literature, except for minor modifications. However, there were inconsistencies in the application in the South African mining industry, between the application of the role and owner’s organisation and project factors prevalent in mining companies. The key message is that owners should perform an analysis of the project environment, including a review of organisation and project factors that may impact on the <b>owner’s</b> <b>representative</b> role, before selecting an <b>owner’s</b> <b>representative...</b>|$|R

40|$|Commissioning is {{a process}} – a {{systematic}} process of ensuring that a building performs {{in accordance with the}} design intent, contract documents, and the owner’s operational needs. Commissioning is fundamental {{to the success of the}} whole-building design process. Due to the sophistication of building designs and the complexity of building systems constructed today, commissioning is necessary, but not automatically included as part of the typical design and contracting process. Commissioning is critical for ensuring that the building design is successfully constructed and operated. Any type of building will benefit from a commissioning effort. Commissioning is even more important in energyefficient buildings to ensure that they perform as intended to maintain comfort. Also, HVAC equipment in better-performing buildings may require advanced control strategies. But commissioning goes beyond the traditional HVAC elements. More and more buildings rely on the integrity of the envelope to ensure comfort. Commissioning can also evaluate claims about the construction materials such as durability and VOC emission content. It can improve power quality for the overall building by verifying that electrical building support and Warren Gretz Rooftop cooling equipment inspection with building <b>owner</b> <b>representative,</b> facility engineer, and installer...|$|E
