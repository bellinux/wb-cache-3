5|$|In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell, William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) {{and others}} {{working under the}} auspices of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, built on Gauss' work and formalised the concept of a {{coherent}} system <b>of</b> <b>units</b> with base units and derived units. The principle of coherence was successfully used to define a number <b>of</b> <b>units</b> of measure based on the centimetre–gram–second system <b>of</b> <b>units</b> (CGS), including the erg for energy, the dyne for force, the barye for pressure, the poise for dynamic viscosity and the stokes for kinematic viscosity.|$|E

5|$|The {{centimetre}} gram second system <b>of</b> <b>units</b> (CGS) was {{the first}} coherent metric system, having been developed in the 1860s and promoted by Maxwell and Thomson. In 1874, this system was formally promoted by the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS). The system's characteristics are that density is expressed in , force expressed in dynes and mechanical energy in ergs. Thermal energy was defined in calories, one calorie being the energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water from 15.5°C to 16.5°C.

5|$|During the {{transition}} period participants in energy, fossil fuels and industry will only need to surrender one NZU for two tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. Free allocation <b>of</b> <b>units</b> to energy-intensive and trade-exposed activities will also be halved. Secondly, participants may pay a fixed price of NZ$25 instead of buying and surrendering units. This measure means that firms will face a cost of no higher than NZ$12.50 per tonne of emissions.

5|$|From the mid-1890s onwards Giovanni Giorgi and Oliver Heaviside {{corresponded with}} each other {{regarding}} these anomalous results. This led to Giorgi presenting a paper to {{the congress of the}} Associazione Elettrotecnica Italiana (A.E.I.) in October 1901 in which he showed that a coherent electro-mechanical system <b>of</b> <b>units</b> could be obtained by adding a fourth base unit of an electrical nature (ampere, volt or ohm) to the three base units proposed in the 1861 BAAS report. This gave the constants ke and km physical dimensions and hence the electro-mechanical quantities ε0 and µ0 were also given physical dimensions. His work also recognized the unifying concept that energy played in the establishment of a coherent, rational system <b>of</b> <b>units</b> with the joule as the unit of energy and the electrical units in the practical system <b>of</b> <b>units</b> remaining unchanged.|$|E

Let L ⊂ R^ 4 be the union <b>of</b> <b>unit</b> balls, whose centres lie on the x_ 3 x_ 4 coordinate plane, and form either a square lattice or a regular triangular lattice, of edge length 2. Then a packing <b>of</b> <b>unit</b> balls in R^ 4 consisting of translates of L has a density at most π ^ 2 / 16, with equality for the densest lattice packing <b>of</b> <b>unit</b> balls in R^ 4.
