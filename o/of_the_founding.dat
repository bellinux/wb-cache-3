40|$|My studio {{research}} proposes {{new uses}} for post-structuralist semiotics by investigating different materialisations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>found</b> object through acts of remaking. This exegesis and <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> my studio practice {{argue that the}} ‘readymade’ in its historical conceptualization has been normalised as a standard method of art making and critical interpretation. By contrast, in this study, <b>the</b> conventional understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> readymade as art context dependent is repositioned in an investigation <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> <b>found</b> object can undergo a process of transposition through remaking and reimaging. This material and textual shifting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conventions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> readymade questions <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> an origin or source to which texts as objects may derive. I argue that a new materiality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>found</b> object can be achieved through <b>the</b> reproductive processes <b>of</b> casting and photography. By critically re-evaluating this process through post-structural theory, this research offers an alternative reading of art objects utilizing technologies of reproduction. Fundamentally, my research argues for a release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>found</b> object from <b>the</b> prescribed historical discourse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> readymade into textual discourses <b>of</b> materiality and <b>the</b> subject. It recognizes <b>the</b> implicit role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body in the reading and writing of these various texts. By incorporating <b>the</b> ideas <b>of</b> jouissance, signifiance, <b>the</b> image-repertoire, différance, translation, and the real, <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body as a palimpsest for the objects I remake is investigated as an interplay between representation and writing, form and text...|$|R
