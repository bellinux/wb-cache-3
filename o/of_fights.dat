5|$|On 11 August, Task Force Bradley {{struck out}} from Yongil Airfield to counterattack the North Korean forces around P'ohang-dong while Task Force P'ohang {{attacked}} from An'gang-ni area. Both forces immediately met resistance from North Korean forces. By that time, the North Korean forces had captured P'ohang-dong. What followed was a complicated series <b>of</b> <b>fights</b> through the large region around P'ohang-dong and An'gang-ni as South Korean ground forces, aided by U.S. air forces engaged groups of North Korean forces operation {{all around the}} vicinity.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{informal}} rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously. The {{most important aspect}} of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers must agree to a fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out <b>of</b> <b>fights.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unique among North American {{professional}} team sports, the National Hockey League (NHL) {{and most}} minor professional leagues in North America do not eject players outright for fighting (although they may {{do so for}} more flagrant violations {{as part of a}} fight) but major European and collegiate hockey leagues do, and multi-game suspensions may be added on top of the ejection. Therefore, the vast majority <b>of</b> <b>fights</b> occur in the NHL and other North American professional leagues.|$|E

5|$|One {{commonly}} held misconception connected to Dyer {{is that he}} holds the second longest unbeaten record <b>of</b> <b>fights</b> of any boxer in world history, after fellow Welsh fighter Jimmy Wilde. This information was published in Nat Fleischer's The Ring: Record Book And Boxing Encyclopedia, in which it states Dyer fought 94 unbeaten fights between 1908 and 1912. Although {{it could be argued}} that Dyer may have boxed 94 fights between these years, and may have turned professional in 1908, it is widely accepted that his fight with Dick Emden in 1911 in which he dislocated his knee was a loss. This therefore challenges Fleischer's claim.|$|E
5|$|Wiggins {{was moved}} to second base in 1984. That move made room for rookie Carmelo Martínez in the outfield. Until that season, Martínez had been a first baseman, but the Padres already had a strong player there with Garvey, {{and they wanted to}} get Martínez's bat into the lineup to improve their outfield's home run production. Wiggins {{retained}} the leadoff spot in the lineup, hitting ahead of Tony Gwynn. During a May game, Wiggins became the fifth 20th-century MLB player to steal five bases in one game, tying an NL record. In an August game, Wiggins unwittingly became a party to a series <b>of</b> <b>fights.</b> Wiggins was hit with the first pitch of the game by Atlanta Braves pitcher Pascual Pérez. The teams retaliated against each other throughout the game with brushback pitches and beanballs. The tension resulted in three fights and several ejections.|$|E

5|$|On August 10, the Eighth Army {{organized}} Task Force P'ohang—the ROK 17th, 25th, and 26th Regiments {{as well as}} the ROK 1st Anti-Guerrilla Battalion, Marine Battalion and {{a battery}} from the US 18th Field Artillery Battalion. This task force was given the mission to clear out North Korean forces in the mountainous region. At the same time, Eighth Army formed Task Force Bradley, consisting of elements of the US 8th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division. Task Force Bradley was tasked with defending P'ohang-dong. What followed was a complicated series <b>of</b> <b>fights</b> throughout the region around P'ohang-dong and An'gang-ni as South Korean ground forces, aided by US air forces, engaged groups of North Korean forces in the area. The NK 12th Division was operating in the valley west of P'ohang-dong and was able to push back Task Force P'ohang and the ROK Capital Division, which was along the line to the east. At the same time, the NK 766th Infantry Regiment and elements of the NK 5th Division fought Task Force Bradley at and south of P'ohang-dong. US naval fire drove the NK troops from the town, but it became a bitterly contested no man's land as fighting moved to the surrounding hills.|$|E

50|$|The Art <b>of</b> <b>Fighting</b> series {{originally}} {{served as}} a prequel to the Fatal Fury series, taking place during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

The Hyper Neo-Geo 64 game Buriki One and the PlayStation port of Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition features an older modern-day Ryo adopting his father's former identity of Mr. Karate. While The King of Fighters series features characters from the Art <b>of</b> <b>Fighting</b> series and alludes to events occurring in the games, it follows a completely different continuity from that of the actual Art <b>of</b> <b>Fighting</b> and Fatal Fury games.

25|$|In {{response}} to the criticism, the UFC increased cooperation with state athletic commissions and redesigned its rules to remove the less palatable elements <b>of</b> <b>fights</b> while retaining the core elements of striking and grappling. UFC 12 saw the introduction of weight classes and the banning of fish-hooking. For UFC 14, gloves became mandatory, while kicks {{to the head of}} a downed opponent were banned. UFC 15 saw limitations on hair pulling, and the banning of strikes {{to the back of the}} neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes. With five-minute rounds introduced at UFC 21, the UFC gradually re-branded itself as a sport rather than a spectacle.|$|E
25|$|Brief fights {{are similar}} except {{there is no}} forearm locking. The losing {{combatant}} seems to use kicking more often, perhaps to parry the thrusts of the eventual winner. A winner is decided when a kangaroo breaks off the fight and retreats. Winners are able to push their opponents backwards or down to the ground. They also seem to grasp their opponents when they break contact and push them away. The initiators of the fights are usually the winners. These fights may serve to establish dominance hierarchies among males, as winners <b>of</b> <b>fights</b> have been seen to displace their opponent from resting sites later in the day. Dominant males may also pull grass to intimidate subordinates.|$|E
