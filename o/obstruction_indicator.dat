40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to evaluate bladder outlet obstruction number (BOON) in order to predict infravesical obstruction in patients with benign prostatic enlargement (BPE). Two hundred patients with proven BPE from daily urological practice at the Urology Department of the Sarajevo University Clinical Centre were covered by a prospective study in period 2009 - 2011. All patients completed International Prostatic Symptom Score, their mean voided volume urine was determined from frequency-volume chart and their prostate volume was determined by transabdominal ultrasound. Subsequently, the patients had free uroflowmetry and they underwent complete urodynamic studies. BOON was calculated using the formula: prostate volume (cc) - 3 x Qmax (ml/s) - 0. 2 x mean voided volume (ml). A satisfactory area under the curve (AUC) was obtained for the prediction of obstruction according to bladder outlet obstruction index, Schaefer obstruction class nomogram and group specific urethral resistance factor, with AUC of 0. 83 (p - 20 {{has been found to}} be the most accurate <b>obstruction</b> <b>indicator</b> (sensitivity 76. 5 % and specificity 68. 2 %), with posttest probability of 77 %. The BOON may be used in daily urological practice as a valid, non-invasive indicator of infravesical obstruction in patients with BPE, with a possibility of correct classification of obstruction in approximately 75 % of the cases. Transabdominal ultrasound has shown to be applicable to the BOON formula in determining prostate volume. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{putative}} {{role of the}} cytokines interleukin- 6 and tumor necrosis {{factor in}} the pathophysiology of the complications and mortality after surgery in jaundiced patients was studied in a murine model. Cytokine serum levels were determined in mice with experimental biliary <b>obstruction.</b> As an <b>indicator</b> of the activation status of macrophages, cytokine release by mononuclear phagocytes obtained from such mice was assessed. Following surgery, interleukin- 6 levels increased to 2 to 3 ng/ml after 3 to 4 hr, but declined rapidly afterward to levels of 60 pg/ml after 10 days. After 12 days, substantial interleukin- 6 levels were observed in jaundiced mice (100 pg/ml), whereas levels in sham mice further decreased (p less than 0. 001). The cytokine tumor necrosis factor was frequently present in the serum of jaundiced mice. After 22 days, when killed, all jaundiced mice showed significant tumor necrosis factor levels (p less than 0. 001). This was in contrast to sham mice in which tumor necrosis factor was never detected. The presence of an activated state of macrophages in jaundiced mice was concluded from the observed high spontaneous cytokine release and significantly higher release after stimulation (p less than 0. 05). The presence of circulating cytokines was discussed {{in the context of}} the postoperative complications observed in jaundiced patient...|$|R
40|$|Aim: There {{are limited}} {{data about the}} role of sleep {{endoscopy}} in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the level, degree and shape of obstruction of the upper airway in patients with OSAS by sleep endoscopy and their relation to OSAS severity. Patients and methods: Fifty consecutive patients with OSAS were prospectively enrolled in this cross sectional analytic study. All patients underwent history, a full night-attended polysomnography and sleep endoscopy. The degree of pharyngeal narrowing (grades I–IV) was evaluated at retropalatal, retroglossal and hypopharyngeal levels. Shape of pharyngeal collapse was classified into circular, lateral or antero-posterior at retropalatal and retroglossal levels. Shape of the epiglottis was also observed. Results: All patients showed multisegmental levels of obstruction. Moderate OSAS had a higher percentage of grade II obstruction but a lower percentage of grade I at hypopharyngeal level compared to mild OSAS (P <  0. 05). Also, in moderate OSAS, tongue base obstruction was 47. 4 % which was significantly higher comparing to mild OSAS (16. 7 %) (P <  0. 05). There was no significant difference between different grades of obstruction at all anatomical levels in polysomnographic parameters. Omega shaped epiglottis was associated with the highest apnea hypopnea index, desaturation index, lowest average and minimum O 2 level. Conclusion: Sleep endoscopy is a useful tool for the assessment of level, degree and shape of the upper airway obstruction during sleep in OSAS and this could be helpful in preoperative evaluation. Presence of obstruction at hypopharyngeal level or tongue base <b>obstruction</b> is an <b>indicator</b> of OSAS severity...|$|R
