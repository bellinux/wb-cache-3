500|$|No {{one in my}} {{large family}} wrote poetry. But the first Russian woman poet, Anna Bunina, was the aunt <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> Erasm Ivanovich Stogov. The Stogovs were modest landowners in the Mozhaisk region of the Moscow Province. They were moved here after the insurrection {{during the time of}} Posadnitsa Marfa. In Novgorod they had been a wealthier and more {{distinguished}} family. Khan Akhmat, my ancestor, was killed one night in his tent by a Russian killer-for-hire. Karamzin tells us that this marked the end of the Mongol yoke on Russia. [...] It was well known that this Akhmat was a descendant of Genghiz Khan. In the eighteenth century, one of the Akhmatov Princesses – Praskovia Yegorovna – married the rich and famous Simbirsk landowner Motovilov. Yegor Motovilov was my great-grandfather; his daughter, Anna Yegorovna, was my grandmother. She died when my mother was nine years old, and I was named in her honour. Several diamond rings and one emerald were made from her brooch. Though my fingers are thin, still her thimble didn't fit me.|$|E
500|$|The Great Dining Room is {{situated}} in the east wing extension {{of the house and}} was added in 1877 under J. MacVicar Anderson {{during the time of the}} Red Earl. The room was inspired by the ballroom of Buckingham Palace, with walls hung with faded, red damask silk. The Spencers ate their regular meals in the Tapestry Dining Room, an inner room of the east side to the east of the Wooton Hall. Aside from the two fine vividly constructed tapestries, one of gypsies and one of farming, the room is fairly bleak in design compared to other rooms in the house; the dining table is relatively small, with a drab grey floor and open brick fireplace dated in large letters to 1683. The [...] "sombre" [...] oak panelling originally came from the family's other property of Wormleighton Manor in Warwickshire. [...] Charles Spencer recalled that three generations of Spencers would eat their lunch together and that dining conditions were [...] "silent, apart from the noises <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> eating with great gusto, a napkin tucked in around his neck, hanging down over his popping-out tummy, and it was all very sad and tense".|$|E

2500|$|During their walks Grant expounded {{his ideas}} to Darwin, {{and on one}} {{occasion}} dropped his guard and praised Lamarck's views on evolution. He explained his radical theory of homology, {{an extension of the}} idea of unity of plan in vogue in Paris at the time. He argued that all animals had similar organs differing only in complexity and, controversially, that this showed their common descent. Grant had announced to the Wernerian his identification of the pancreas in a pinned-out sea-slug, showing an organ molluscs shared with mammals. He assumed that as the earth cooled, changing conditions drove life towards higher, hotter blooded forms, as shown by a progressive sequence of fossils, and that study of eggs of the simplest creatures would help reveal monads, elementary living particles. While this showed that naturalists could try to [...] "lift the veil that hangs over the origin and progress of the organic world", Darwin was troubled by Grant's atheism and could see that transmutation was far from respectable. Darwin later recalled [...] "I listened in silent astonishment, and as far as I can judge, without any effect on my mind. I had previously read the Zoönomia <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather,</b> in which similar views are maintained, but without producing any effect on me." ...|$|E
