40|$|The aim of {{our present}} work was the {{development}} of a rapid high-performance liquid chromatography method with electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-ESI-MS/MS) for the determination of several corticosteroids in cosmetic products. Corticosteroids are suspected to be illegally added in <b>cosmetic</b> <b>preparations</b> in order to enhance the curative effect against some skin diseases. Sample preparation step consists in a single extraction with acetonitrile followed by centrifugation and filtration. The compounds were separated by reversed-phase chromatography with water and acetonitrile (both with 0. 1 % formic acid) gradient elution and detected by ESI-MS positive and negative ionization mode. The method was validated at the validation level of 0. 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1. Linearity was studied in the 5 – 250 [*]μg[*]L− 1 range and linear coefficients (r 2) were all over 0. 99. The accuracy and precision of the method were satisfactory. The LOD ranged from 0. 085 to 0. 109 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 and the LOQ from 0. 102 to 0. 121 [*]mg[*]kg− 1. Mean recoveries for all the analytes were within the range 91. 9 – 99. 2 %.

30|$|<b>Cosmetic</b> <b>preparations</b> {{containing}} mercury for bleaching {{purpose is}} an old practice (Al-Saleh and Al-Doush 1997). Mercury is a toxic metal but found usefulness in many <b>cosmetic</b> <b>preparations</b> targeted at skin lightening by suppression of melanin production by the skin (Bourgeosis et al. 1986). Cosmetic products containing mercury {{in the form of}} inorganic mercury are mainly used by dark skinned people mostly in developing countries (Barr et al. 1973). Mercury is a volatile element and is harmful to the skin when used in an effort to lighten the skin. However, chronic exposure of the body to mercury at very low concentration can cause long-lasting neurological and kidney impairment (Hutson et al. 1999). Mercury in bleaching preparations can be absorbed through the skin and accumulates in body organs giving rise to severe toxicity (Sah 2012). A study conducted on Tanzanian gold miners who use mercury for amalgamation and people not engaged in gold mining activities revealed that the mercury found in their blood and urine was derived from cosmetic soaps and creams containing mercury (Kahatano et al. 1998). Glahder and Appell (1999) also reported high levels of mercury in imported soaps and creams bought in Tanzanian shops. An investigation of Kenyan women with damaged kidney also revealed that they suffered severely from higher incidence of nephritic syndrome, which was attributed to the use of creams containing mercury (Barr et al. 1973).|$|R

Besides the risk of contamination during manufacturing, multidose <b>cosmetic</b> <b>preparations</b> may be contaminated by consumers during their use. In this paper, the results of the utilization of nanoparticles as reservoir systems of parabens, the most used class of preservatives, were reported. Two different systems, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) made of pure precirol and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) made of precirol and almond oil, containing three parabens as single molecules or as a mixture, were prepared and tested. All the systems were characterized for size, polydispersion index, zeta potential and encapsulation efficiency. Release experiments, carried out in steady state and sink conditions, allowed to evidence that both SLN and NLC were able to act as reservoir systems.
