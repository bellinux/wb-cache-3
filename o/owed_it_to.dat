25|$|On May 8, 1869, James and Sarah {{had another}} son, James Rowland Angell, who later served as {{president}} of Yale University. That same year, the University of Michigan offered Angell its presidency following the resignation of Erastus Haven. He visited Ann Arbor with his wife, but felt that he <b>owed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his supporters in Vermont to stay on with the University of Vermont. The offer was repeated in 1871, his former teacher Henry S. Frieze having served as acting president in the meantime. This time, Angell felt that the University of Vermont had made enough progress that he could leave it in good conscience, and he accepted the offer. He made a trip to Ann Arbor to deliver his inaugural address at Commencement on June 28, 1871, then returned to Vermont to finish out the academic term before moving his family to Ann Arbor for good in September of that year.|$|E
500|$|Hershiser picked Roberto Alomar off {{at first}} base to end the eighth inning. When the game went into extra innings, Hershiser {{did not want to}} continue: [...] "I really didn't want to break it", Hershiser said. [...] "I wanted to stop at 58. I wanted me and Don to be {{together}} at the top. But the higher sources (Lasorda and Perranoski) told me they weren't taking me out of the game, so I figured, what the heck, I might as well get the guy out." [...] Through the first nine innings, no Padre had reached second base. Lasorda, Perranoski and Ben Hines all felt he <b>owed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the game and to himself to continue. Hershiser made it through the tenth inning, with the record-setting out being a Keith Moreland flyball caught by right fielder José González. However, he had some close calls in a couple of innings. Marvell Wynne struck out swinging to open the inning, but reached first base after a wild pitch evaded [...] catcher Mike Scioscia. The following two hitters, Santiago and Randy Ready, moved Wynne over to third with two outs. Then, Garry Templeton was given an intentional base on balls. Templeton advanced to second base before the final out was recorded.|$|E
2500|$|An {{attorney}} {{retained by}} {{the families of}} some of the boys who were allegedly abused by Sandusky criticized the decision by the board to fire Paterno, saying, [...] "The school let the victims down once, and I think they <b>owed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the victims to at least gauge how the immediate termination decision would impact them as opposed to Mr. Paterno's resignation {{at the end of the}} year." ...|$|E

Another problem occurred that year when he suffered burns to his hands from a methanol fire during practice for the Indianapolis 500. As a result, he missed the Dutch Grand Prix in 1970. Undeterred, he felt he <b>owed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Bruce and the McLaren to continue racing. Besides his emotional distress and serious burns, he still managed a creditable fourth in the championship with 27 points.|$|E
2500|$|Reed {{retired from}} the Hopkins faculty in June 1953, only to be {{recalled}} later that summer to serve as president when Detlev Bronk departed for Rockefeller University. In September 1953, he returned to Baltimore {{from his home in}} New Hampshire to accept the presidency, stating, [...] "For 30-odd years, I have had a glorious time at the Hopkins. I <b>owed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the people there to return." [...] Although {{he made it clear that}} he did not plan to serve indefinitely, he did not regard himself as a caretaker or interim president. He oversaw the end of the Owen Lattimore espionage indictments (all charges were dropped in 1955), and new construction on the various Hopkins campuses, while still keeping a hand in biostatistics.|$|E
2500|$|I was {{interested}} {{to hear him}} express as his opinion what I had written him some time ago {{in one of my}} letters, to the effect that if Germany won it would change the course of our civilization and make the United States a military nation. He also spoke of his deep regret, as indeed I did to him in that same letter, that it would check his policy for a better international ethical code. [...] He felt deeply the destruction of Louvain , and I found him as unsympathetic with the German attitude as is the balance of America. He goes even further than I in his condemnation of Germany's part in this war, and almost allows his feeling to include the German people as a whole rather than the leaders alone. He said German philosophy was essentially selfish and lacking in spirituality. When I spoke of the Kaiser building up the German machine as a means of maintaining peace, he said, [...] "What a foolish thing it was to create a powder magazine and risk someone's dropping a spark into it!" [...] He thought the war would throw the world back three or four centuries. I did not agree with him. He was particularly scornful of Germany’s disregard of treaty obligations, and was indignant at the German Chancellor’s designation of the Belgian Treaty as being [...] "only a scrap of paper"....But although the personal feeling of the President was with the Allies, he insisted then and for many months after, that this ought not to affect his political attitude, which he intended should be one of strict neutrality. [...] He felt that he <b>owed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the world to prevent the spreading of the conflagration, that he <b>owed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the country to save it from the horrors of war.|$|E

2500|$|Rand's {{stated goal}} for writing the novel was [...] "to show how desperately {{the world needs}} prime movers and how viciously it treats them" [...] and to portray [...] "what happens to the world without them". The core idea for the book came to her after a 1943 {{telephone}} conversation with a friend, who asserted that Rand <b>owed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> her readers to write fiction about her philosophy. Rand replied, [...] "What if I went on strike? What if all the creative minds of the world went on strike?" [...] Rand then began Atlas Shrugged to depict the morality of rational self-interest, by exploring {{the consequences of a}} strike by intellectuals refusing to supply their inventions, art, business leadership, scientific research, or new ideas {{to the rest of the}} world.|$|E
2500|$|As January 2014 began, Morissette started {{recurring}} {{appearances on}} ABS-CBN's ASAP. They started to introduce her {{as one of}} the Divas, together with her former teammate from The Voice of the Philippines, Klarisse de Guzman. They were given a segment on ASAP called [...] "HD" [...] or [...] "Homegrown Divas", along with Angeline Quinto. She also started performing in It's Showtime, ABS-CBN's noontime variety show. Unlike her performances in ASAP, majority of those in It's Showtime are solo numbers. This show provided Amon a venue to demonstrate her talent not only in singing but also in dancing, as some of her numbers require her to sing and dance at the same time. However, this also generated some controversy as Morissette was accused of lip syncing Ariana Grande's [...] "Break Free", after judges praised her for keeping her voice steady despite dancing and singing {{from one side of the}} stage to another. She clarified that it was a live performance and that she <b>owed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the audience to give them one.|$|E
2500|$|The Australians {{travelled}} up to Scarborough {{over the}} weekend ready for their final first-class fixture against [...] "Buns" [...] Thornton's team on the Monday. Thornton had selected a strong team captained by Reggie Spooner and including George Hirst, Wilfred Rhodes, Jack Hobbs, Johnny Douglas, Arthur Dolphin, Greville Stevens and Bill Hitch. It was a good toss to win and Spooner put the Australians in to face the pace of Hitch who bowled them out for 81 in just 31 overs. Hitch took five of the first six wickets, four of them bowled, and finished with six for 24. The early fire {{had gone out of}} the pitch by afternoon although Gregory still caused real problems for the English batsmen. At the close, Thornton's XI were 146 for eight and they extended this to 187, Gregory taking seven for 83. Needing a substantial recovery, the AIF started badly with Trenerry out for a duck but Collins and Willis took the score on to 93 before Collins was out. Willis, the highest runscorer for the AIF in England, made 96 before he was caught behind off Hirst. Taylor (71) and Lampard (36) combined well for the seventh wicket and the Australians were 264 for six at close of play on day two. On the final morning, Hitch again cut loose and the last four wickets went down with only 32 more runs added. AIF 296, Hitch five for 102 and eleven wickets in the match. Thornton's XI needed 191 to win with most of the final day remaining and got them with two wickets to spare but they <b>owed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Hobbs who held the innings together with 93. This was only the fourth defeat the AIF conceded in England, having won and drawn twelve each of the other 24 matches.|$|E
