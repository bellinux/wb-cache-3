5|$|A 2-octave Schulmerich {{electronic}} carillon {{of twenty-five}} bells {{was installed in}} the tower in June 1958. It was played from the organ console by a carillonneur on Sunday mornings before and after services, {{as well as on}} special occasions, such as Christmas Eve and as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> noontime nationwide peal of church bells on the Fourth of July. Hymns were also played daily on the carillon by a music roll until it was discontinued in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|A major {{development}} of this period was the appearance of stellate (star-shaped) shrines in a few temples built <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> sandstone, such as the Trimurti Temple at Savadi, the Paramesvara Temple at Konnur and the Gauramma Temple at Hire Singgangutti. In all three cases, the shrine is a 16-pointed uninterrupted star, a ground-plan not found anywhere else in India and which entirely differentiates these temples from the 32-pointed interrupted star plans of bhumija shrines in northern India.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the emperor}} by others might be gained at the daily {{reception}} (salutatio), a development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> homage a client paid to his patron; public banquets hosted at the palace; and religious ceremonies. The common people who lacked this access could manifest their general approval or displeasure as a group at the games held in large venues. By the 4th century, as urban centres decayed, the Christian emperors became remote figureheads who issued general rulings, no longer responding to individual petitions.|$|E

5|$|Acurad was a {{die casting}} process {{developed}} by General Motors {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s. The name is an acronym for accurate, reliable, and dense. It was developed to combine a stable fill and directional solidification with the fast cycle times <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> die casting process. The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for die casting: thermal analysis, flow and fill modeling, heat treatable and high integrity die castings, and indirect squeeze casting (explained below).|$|E
5|$|Although {{influenced}} by Matisse, the Oriental art that Jolin discovered at Musée Guimet {{was even more}} important to his style. Chinese and Japanese art became the base for the decorative, slightly naïve style in light colours, that he developed during the 1910s and 1920s. Jolin's style deviates from that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> Expressionists, in that he simplifies his motifs in an almost primitive way, painting an imagined reality rather than raw emotions.|$|E
5|$|Although the Romans {{had a more}} hostile {{attitude}} {{than the}} Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and worship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> gods continued. The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not {{to the extent that}} the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians.|$|E

5|$|As well as celebrating many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> {{religious}} festivals of Great Britain, such as Easter and Christmas, Wales has its {{own unique}} celebratory days. An early festivity was Mabsant, when local parishes would celebrate {{the patron saint of}} their local church. This celebration died out in the 19th century, to be replaced by Saint David's Day, which is celebrated on 1 March throughout Wales, and by Welsh expats around the world.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{inclination}} of its orbit, Eris only passes through a few constellations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> Zodiac; it {{is now in the}} constellation Cetus. It was in Sculptor from 1876 until 1929 and Phoenix from roughly 1840 until 1875. In 2036 it will enter Pisces and stay there until 2065, when it will enter Aries. It will then move into the northern sky, entering Perseus in 2128 and Camelopardalis (where it will reach its northernmost declination) in 2173.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of the game in Spain, modifications to the traditional rules have appeared regionally, creating variations.

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20th century, Peking opera {{witnessed}} a steady decline in audience numbers. This has been attributed both to a decrease in performance quality and an inability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> opera form to capture modern life. Furthermore, the archaic language of Peking opera required productions to use electronic subtitles, which hampered the development of the form. The influence of Western culture has also left the younger generations impatient with the slow pacing of Peking opera. In response, Peking opera began to see reform starting in the 1980s. Such reforms have taken the form of creating a school of performance theory to increase performance quality, employing modern elements to attract new audiences, and performing new plays outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> canon. However, these reforms have been hampered by both a lack of funding and an adverse political climate that makes the performance of new plays difficult.|$|E

Although many of the player's actions are compulsory, Golden Sun often allows the player to visit previous locations and complete certain objectives out of order.|$|E
5|$|Hope {{is closely}} related to Idle Child of Fancy, {{completed}} by Watts in 1885, which also shows a personification of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> virtues (in this case Love) sitting on a cloud-shrouded globe.
