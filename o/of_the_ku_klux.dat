5|$|Although Haynes was a prohibitionist, he was {{a critic}} of the Indiana Branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan, which was in the height of its power during the 1910s and 1920s. In letters to friends and fellow prohibitionists, he {{ridiculed}} the organization for using violent and illegal tactics to achieve prohibition, and accused them of hypocrisy for supporting many anti-prohibition Democratic politicians. Kokomo politics was dominated by the Klan during that period and it is unknown if Haynes spoke publicly against the organization.|$|E
5|$|One of the lynchers {{may have}} been Charley Guthrie (died 1956), father of the folk singer Woody Guthrie, {{who was born in}} Okemah 14 months after the lynching. Charley was an Okemah {{real-estate}} agent, district court clerk, Democratic politician, Freemason and owner of the town's first automobile. According to Joe Klein, he was also a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan in the 1920s. There is no documentary evidence that Charley was a Klansman.|$|E

5|$|Social {{tensions}} were {{exacerbated by}} the revival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, $1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to {{be as high as}} 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.|$|E
5|$|Hiram Wesley Evans (September 26, 1881– September 14, 1966) was Imperial Wizard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan, an American white {{supremacist}} group, from 1922 to 1939. A native of Alabama, Evans attended Vanderbilt University {{and became a}} dentist. He operated a small, moderately successful practice in Texas until 1920, {{when he joined the}} Klan's Dallas chapter. He quickly rose through the ranks and was part of a group that ousted William Joseph Simmons from the position of Imperial Wizard, the national leader, in November 1922. Evans succeeded him and sought to transform the group into a political power.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Reno Gang and other criminals, several white cap groups began operating in the state, primarily in the southern counties. They began carrying out lynchings against suspected criminals, leading the state to attempt {{to crack down on}} their practices. By the turn of the 20th century, they had become so notorious that anti-lynching laws were passed and in one incident the governor called out the militia to protect a prisoner. When the white caps showed up to lynch him, the militia opened fire, killing one and wounding eleven. Vigilante activity decreased following the incident, and remained low until the rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan in the 1920s.|$|E

25|$|With <b>the</b> {{rapid growth}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan (KKK) 1921–25, anti-Catholic rhetoric intensified. <b>The</b> Catholic Church <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Little Flower was first built in 1925 in Royal Oak, Michigan, a largely Protestant area.

5|$|Morrow urged {{enforcement}} of state laws against carrying concealed weapons and restricted activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan. During {{his first year}} in office, he granted only 100 pardons. This was a considerable decrease from the number granted by his immediate predecessors. During their first years in office, J. C. W. Beckham granted 350 pardons, James B. McCreary (during his second stint as governor) granted 139, and Augustus O. Stanley granted 257. He was also {{an active member of the}} Commission on Interracial Cooperation, a society for the elimination of racial violence in the South.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{social changes}} during this period, {{especially}} the 1920s, {{led to the}} reemergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan in the urban centers of Texas, with their strongest presence in Dallas. As in other states, the new Klan was not outwardly focused on suppression of black civil rights, but instead supported traditional morality including opposition to bootlegging, gambling, and other vices that had grown during the period. Bigotry, though, was never far from the group's agenda. During the Depression, anti-New Deal sentiments among some leaders, such as John Kirby, led to their becoming loosely associated with the Klan and its ideals.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, three {{civil rights}} workers (two white and one black) who {{organize}} a voter registry for African Americans in Jessup County, Mississippi go missing. The Federal Bureau of Investigation sends two agents, Rupert Anderson—a former Mississippi sheriff—and Alan Ward, to investigate. The pair {{find it difficult}} to conduct interviews with the local townspeople, as Sheriff Ray Stuckey and his deputies exert influence over the public and are linked to a branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan. The wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell reveals to Anderson in a discreet conversation that the three missing men have been murdered. Their bodies are later found buried in an earthen dam. Stuckey deduces Mrs Pell's confession to the FBI and informs Pell, who brutally beats his wife in retribution.|$|E

5|$|Lewisville {{is served}} mainly by media from the Dallas area, {{but a number}} of niche {{publications}} focus on local news. The Lewisville Enterprise merged with The Lewisville Leader in 1962. The paper's publisher and editor at the time, U.O. Clements, was a staunch conservative, but vociferously supported the racial integration of Lewisville Independent School District, for which he received many anonymous threats from members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan. Clements sold the paper to Harte-Hanks Community Newspapers in 1971. Star Newspapers, which owned the Leader, was purchased by 1013 Communications in 2012. The newspaper is based in Plano, Texas. In 2011, the Lewisville City Council designated the Lewisville portion of Neighborsgo, a weekly section of The Dallas Morning News, as the city's official newspaper of record.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the staff}} of The Political Cesspool {{organized}} a rally at the Tennessee area known as Confederate Park, which, along with two other Confederacy-themed parks in downtown Memphis, {{has been the subject}} of a longtime controversy for honoring Confederate soldiers and ideals. The park had been criticized earlier by a black Shelby County official, which attracted the notice of New York-based activist Al Sharpton, who was invited by the Reverend LaSimba Gray to hold a demonstration in Memphis. Sharpton planned a march called the Rally for Dignity from downtown Memphis to another park honoring Confederate Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest who was involved early in the organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan. Sharpton canceled the march after Edwards and The Political Cesspool staff obtained a permit to demonstrate in Confederate Park, located along Sharpton's planned march route.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{was born}} Wesley Kanne in Chicago on December 23, 1944. His father Benjamin died on December 6, 1948; his mother then moved {{the family to}} Little Rock, Arkansas. This move was made {{for a variety of}} reasons, {{including}} escaping the greater cost of living in a large city such as Chicago, the support Veneta's family in Arkansas could provide, and her feeling of being an outsider to the remaining Kanne family as she did not share their religion. Once in Little Rock, Veneta married Viktor Clark, whom she met while working as a secretary at a bank. Viktor raised Wesley as his son, and officially adopted him on Wesley's 16th birthday. Wesley's name was changed to Wesley Kanne Clark. Viktor Clark's name actually replaced that of Wesley's biological father on his birth certificate, something Wesley would later say that he wished they had not done. Veneta raised Wesley without telling him of his Jewish ancestry to protect him from the anti-Jewish activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan in the southern U.S. Although his mother was Methodist, Clark chose a Baptist church after moving to Little Rock and continued attending it throughout his childhood.|$|E

50|$|After the war, Pettus had {{returned}} to Alabama and resumed his law practice in Selma.

5|$|Finally {{linked to}} the rest of the nation by rail, Denver prospered as a service and supply center. The young city grew during these years, {{attracting}} millionaires with their mansions, as well as the poverty and crime of a rapidly growing city. Denver citizens were proud when the rich chose Denver and were thrilled when Horace Tabor, the Leadville mining millionaire, built an impressive business block at 16th and Larimer as well as the elegant Tabor Grand Opera House. Luxurious hotels, including the much-loved Brown Palace Hotel, soon followed, as well as splendid homes for millionaires like the Croke, Patterson, Campbell Mansion at 11th and Pennsylvania and the now-demolished Moffat Mansion at 8th and Grant. Intent on transforming Denver into one of the world's great cities, leaders wooed industry and enticed laborers to work in these factories. Soon, in addition to the elite and a large middle class, Denver had a growing population of German, Italian, and Chinese laborers, soon followed by African-Americans and Spanish-surnamed workers. Unprepared for this influx, the Silver Crash of 1893 unsettled political, social, and economic balances, laying the foundation for ethnic bigotry, such as the Red Scare and the rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan, as well as corruption and crime.|$|E
5|$|His father, Calvin T. Underwood, was a peach {{farmer in}} his home town of Gaffney who {{died at the age}} of 43 of a heart attack. The Underwoods lived in poverty, and nearly lost the farm when Frank was a child; to get a bank loan and avoid foreclosure, his father {{attended}} a meeting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan, of which the bank manager was a member. Underwood speaks fondly of his father in public, but this is a political ploy; in his asides to the audience, Underwood describes his father as a weak man who accomplished nothing with his life. He even urinates on his father's grave in season 3. Despite disliking his father, however, Underwood was influenced by him. Calvin was an abusive alcoholic and caused his wife and son years of misery. Underwood has said that when he was 13, he walked in on his father putting a shotgun in his mouth. Calvin asked him to pull the trigger, which he refused to do. He has stated that his biggest regret is not killing his father when he had the chance.|$|E

50|$|After <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, whites {{had worked}} to re-establish {{political}} and social supremacy over freedmen and over those who in the antebellum years were free people <b>of</b> color. <b>The</b> <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan and paramilitary groups practiced racial intimidation and other efforts to dissuade blacks from voting.
