2500|$|The UCW-Zero Heavyweight Championship is {{the primary}} singles {{championship}} title in Ultra Championship Wrestling-Zero. It was first won by Blitz Mason in March 2003 and defended throughout the state of Utah, most often Salt Lake City, Utah, {{but also in the}} Rocky Mountains and the Southwest United States. The title was formerly recognized by AWA Superstars from 2005 to 2007, and then by the National Wrestling Alliance when the promotion became an NWA territory that same year. On February 26, 2011, the UCW-Zero Heavyweight Championship was around the waist of Los Mochis Paco until it was stolen by Tyler Cintron after Junior X attacked Paco. Later, Paco retrieved his belt back from Tyler Cintron. The following show however, Tyler Cintron walks into the ring with his own UCW-Zero Heavyweight Championship. UCW Director Blitz decide to make a Triple Threat TLC Match to determine the Undisputed UCW-Zero Heavyweight Champion which took place on June 4, 2011. Los Mochis Paco was the victor to become the Undisputed Heavyweight Champion. It would however be short lived because Los Mochis Paco was attacked by Black <b>Out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and broke his leg and was unable to defend it. Two Weeks later on June 18, 2011, Director for the night and Former 4 time UCW-Zero Heavyweight Champion Martin Casaus made a Gauntlet Match to determine a New Champion. In the end, it was Junior X that prevailed and became the NEW UCW-Zero Heavyweight Champion. 2011 Rocky Mountain Rumble Champion Kid Kade {{went on to win the}} UCW-Zero Heavyweight Champion after defeating Junior X at [...] "Meltdown Mayhem" [...] on August 13, 2011.|$|E

He pretends he hasn't got a thing in his hand, and that the cat don't see him, and that he don't see the cat. That's the idea. Never drag her hand out where she'll have to take notice of it. Don't let her know that you think she knows you have the least idea she is aware you are holding her hand. That was my rule of tactics; and as far as Paisley's serenade about {{hostilities}} and misadventure went, {{he might as well have}} been reading to her a time- table of the Sunday trains that stop at Ocean Grove, New Jersey.|$|E

60|$|Our next-door {{neighbor}} comes <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> garden {{every now and}} then and says it's doing the country a world of good--not his coming out into the back garden, but the weather. He doesn't understand anything about it, but ever since he started a cucumber-frame last summer he has regarded himself in the light of an agriculturist, and talks in this absurd way with the idea of impressing the rest of the terrace with the notion that he is a retired farmer. I can only hope that for this once he is correct, and that the weather really is doing good to something, because it is doing me a considerable amount of damage. It is spoiling both my clothes and my temper. The latter I can afford, as I have a good supply of it, but it wounds me to the quick to see my dear old hats and trousers sinking, prematurely worn and aged, beneath the cold world's blasts and snows.|$|E
60|$|Upon an impressionable {{child the}} effect of this continual and pretty accompaniment to life was deep. The woman's quietism and piety passed on to his {{different}} nature undiminished; but whereas in her it was a native sentiment, in him it was only an implanted dogma. Nature and the child's pugnacity at times revolted. A cad from the Potterrow once struck him in the mouth; he struck back, the pair fought it <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> stable lane towards the Meadows, and Archie returned with a considerable {{decline in the number of}} his front teeth, and unregenerately boasting of the losses of the foe. It was a sore day for Mrs. Weir; she wept and prayed over the infant backslider until my lord was due from Court, and she must resume that air of tremulous composure with which she always greeted him. The judge was that day in an observant mood, and remarked upon the absent teeth.|$|E

A large section of the audience expressed their indignation at such a slur upon the travelers by noisy shouts of dissent and cries of, 'Don't put it!' 'Withdraw!' 'Turn him out!' On the other hand, the malcontents--and it cannot be denied that they were fairly numerous--cheered for the amendment, with cries of 'Order!' 'Chair!' and 'Fair play!' A scuffle broke <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> benches, and blows were freely exchanged among the medical students who crowded {{that part of the}} hall. It was only the moderating influence of the presence of large numbers of ladies which prevented an absolute riot. Suddenly, however, there was a pause, a hush, and then complete silence. Professor Challenger was on his feet. His appearance and manner are peculiarly arresting, and as he raised his hand for order the whole audience settled down expectantly to give him a hearing.|$|E
50|$|Elephants {{have four}} molars; each weighs about 5 kg and {{measures}} about 30 cm long.

Elephants replace their teeth {{four to six}} times in their lifetimes. Around 40 to 60 years of age, the elephant loses the last of its molars and will likely die of starvation, a common cause of death. African elephants have 24 teeth in total, six on each quadrant of the jaw. The enamel plates of the molars are fewer in number than in Asian elephants.|$|R
