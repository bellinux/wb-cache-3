40|$|Robust {{parameter}} {{design is}} an engineering methodology {{intended as a}} cost effective approach {{to improve the quality}} of products, processes and systems. Control factors are those system parameters that can be easily controlled and manipulated. <b>Noise</b> <b>factors</b> are those system parameters that are difficult and/or costly to control and are presumed uncontrollable. Robust parameter design involves choosing optimal levels of the controllable factors in order to obtain a target or optimal response with minimal variation. <b>Noise</b> <b>factors</b> bring variability into the system, thus affecting the response. The aim is to properly choose the levels of control factors so that the process is robust or insensitive to the variation caused by <b>noise</b> <b>factors.</b> Robust parameter design methods are used to make systems more reliable and robust to incoming variations in environmental effects, manufacturing processes and customer usage patterns. However, robust design can become expensive, time consuming, and/or resource intensive. Thus research that makes robust design less resource intensive and requires less number of experimental runs is of great value. Robust design methodology can be expressed as multi-response optimization problem. (cont.) The objective functions of the problem being: maximizing reliability and robustness of systems, minimizing the information and/or resources required for robust design methodology, and minimizing the number of experimental runs needed. This thesis discusses various <b>noise</b> <b>factor</b> strategies which aim to reduce number of experimental runs needed to improve quality of system. Compound Noise and Take-The-Best-Few <b>Noise</b> <b>Factors</b> Strategy are such <b>noise</b> <b>factor</b> strategies which reduce experimental effort needed to improve reliability of systems. Compound Noise is made by combing all the different <b>noise</b> <b>factors</b> together, irrespective of the number of <b>noise</b> <b>factors.</b> But such a noise strategy works only for the systems which show effect sparsity. To apply the Take-The-Best-Few <b>Noise</b> <b>Factors</b> Strategy most important <b>noise</b> <b>factors</b> in system's <b>noise</b> <b>factor</b> space are found. <b>Noise</b> <b>factors</b> having significant impact on system response variation are considered important. Once the important <b>noise</b> <b>factors</b> are identified, they are kept independent in the <b>noise</b> <b>factor</b> array. By selecting the few most important <b>noise</b> <b>factors</b> for a given system, run size of experiment is minimized. (cont.) Take-The-Best-Few <b>Noise</b> <b>Factors</b> Strategy is very effective for all kinds of systems irrespective of their effect sparsity. Generally Take-The-Best-Few <b>Noise</b> <b>Factors</b> Strategy achieves nearly 80 % of the possible improvement for all systems. This thesis also tries to find the influence of correlation and variance of induced noise on quality of system. For systems that do not contain any significant three-factor interactions correlation among <b>noise</b> <b>factors</b> can be neglected. Hence amount of information needed {{to improve the quality of}} systems is reduced. by Jagmeet Singh. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|In {{this paper}} we suggest a {{potential}} use of data compression measures, {{such as the}} Entropy and the Huffman Coding, to assess the effects of <b>noise</b> <b>factors</b> on the reliability of tested systems. In particular, we extend the Taguchi method for robust design by computing the entropy of the percent contribution values of the <b>noise</b> <b>factors.</b> The new measures are computed already at the parameter-design stage and together with the traditional S/N ratios enable the specification of a robust design Assuming that (some of) the <b>noise</b> <b>factors</b> should be naturalized, the entropy of a design reflects the potential efforts that will be required in the tolerance-design stage to reach a more reliable system.

Assuming that the percent contribution values can reflect the probability of a <b>noise</b> <b>factor</b> to trigger a disturbance in the system response, a series of probabilistic algorithms {{can be applied to the}} robust design problem. We focus on the Huffman coding algorithm and show how to implement this algorithm such that the designer obtains the minimal expected number of tests in order to find the disturbing <b>noise</b> <b>factor.</b> The entropy measure, in this case, provides the lower bound on the algorithm's performance.

40|$|The {{uncertainty}} of the model form is typically neglected in process optimization studies.

Traditionally, in process optimization, methods such as the Dual Response Surface methodology are used in the presence of <b>noise</b> <b>factors,</b> and methods such as Robust Regression are used when the error terms are not normally distributed. This paper extends the idea of model-robustness of [9] using the Bayesian posterior predictive density of the process response to cases where there is uncertainty due to <b>noise</b> <b>factors</b> and due to non-normal error terms.
