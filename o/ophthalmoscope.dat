5|$|Damage to {{the optic}} nerve (II) affects {{specific}} aspects of vision that depend on {{the location of the}} lesion. A person {{may not be able to}} see objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the optic chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by examining the visual field, or by examining the retina with an <b>ophthalmoscope,</b> using a process known as funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in the optic nerve, or further along the visual pathways.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of the nervous system}} is typically normal apart from the presence of papilledema, which is seen on {{examination of}} the eye with a small device called an <b>ophthalmoscope</b> or in more detail with a fundus camera. If there are cranial nerve abnormalities, these may be noticed on eye examination {{in the form of a}} squint (third, fourth, or sixth nerve palsy) or as facial nerve palsy. If the papilledema has been longstanding, visual fields may be constricted and visual acuity may be decreased. Visual field testing by automated (Humphrey) perimetry is recommended as other methods of testing may be less accurate. Longstanding papilledema leads to optic atrophy, in which the disc looks pale and visual loss tends to be advanced.|$|E
25|$|Babbage also invented an <b>ophthalmoscope,</b> {{which he}} gave to Thomas Wharton Jones for testing. Jones, however, ignored it. The device only came into use after being {{independently}} invented by Hermann von Helmholtz.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} effect and {{advantage}} of performing rhegmatogenous retina detachment surgery under operation microscope with under direct <b>ophthalmoscopes.</b> METHODS: Ninety-three patients(93 eyes) were randomized to two groups, Group A(under operation microscope during rhegmatogenous retina detachment surgery, 47 cases), Group B(under direct <b>ophthalmoscopes</b> during rhegmatogenous retina detachment surgery, 46 cases). All patients were followed up for 2 wk to observe success rate and visual improving rate. RESULTS: Total percentage of success was 95. 74 % in group A and 80. 43 % in group B. The visual improving rate of group A was 82. 98 % {{and it was}} 67. 39 % in group B. Operative time in group A was significantly shorter than that in group B(P 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Performing rhegmatogenous retina detachment surgery under operation microscope is ascertaining and it is more effective and handy than performing that surgery under direct <b>ophthalmoscopes...</b>|$|R
25|$|Floaters {{are often}} readily {{observed}} by an ophthalmologist or an optometrist {{with the use}} of an <b>ophthalmoscope</b> or slit lamp. However, if the floater is near the retina, it may not be visible to the observer even if it appears large to the sufferer.|$|E
25|$|Cortical {{cataracts}} {{are due to}} {{the lens}} cortex (outer layer) becoming opaque. They occur when changes in the fluid contained in {{the periphery of the}} lens causes fissuring. When these cataracts are viewed through an <b>ophthalmoscope,</b> or other magnification system, the appearance is similar to white spokes of a wheel. Symptoms often include problems with glare and light scatter at night.|$|E
25|$|Retinal {{detachment}} can {{be examined}} by fundus photography or ophthalmoscopy. Fundus photography generally needs a considerably larger instrument than the <b>ophthalmoscope,</b> {{but has the}} advantage of availing the image to be examined by a specialist at another location and/or time, as well as providing photo documentation for future reference. Modern fundus photographs generally recreate considerably larger areas of the fundus than what can be seen at any one time with handheld ophthalmoscopes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ophthalmoscopes</b> {{to image}} the retina {{are widely used}} {{diagnostic}} tools in ophthalmology and are vital for the early detection of many eye diseases. Although there are various effective optical implementations of <b>ophthalmoscopes,</b> new, robust systems may have a future practical importance in cases where ocular media present significant opacities. Here, we present, as a proof of concept, a novel approach for imaging the retina in real time using a single pixel detector combined with spatially coded illumination. Examples of retinal images in both artificial and real human eyes are presented {{for the first time}} to our knowledge...|$|R
50|$|Cobalt blue {{is used as}} {{a filter}} used in <b>ophthalmoscopes,</b> and is used to {{illuminate}} the cornea of the eye following application of fluorescein dye which is used to detect corneal ulcers and scratches.|$|R
50|$|Although corneal {{abrasions}} may be {{seen with}} <b>ophthalmoscopes,</b> slit lamp microscopes provide higher magnification which allow for a more thorough evaluation. To aid in viewing, a fluorescein stain that fills in the corneal defect and glows with a cobalt blue-light is generally instilled first.|$|R
25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{most commonly}} involves {{a break in}} the retina that then allows the fluid in the eye to get behind the retina. A break in the retina can occur from a posterior vitreous detachment, injury to the eye, or inflammation of the eye. Other risk factors include being short sighted and previous cataract surgery. Retinal detachments also rarely occur due to a choroidal tumor. Diagnosis is by either looking {{at the back of the}} eye with an <b>ophthalmoscope</b> or by ultrasound.|$|E
25|$|Schepens {{invented the}} {{binocular}} indirect <b>ophthalmoscope</b> (BIO), which is routinely {{used to look}} at the retina. His original BIO is now {{in the collection of the}} Smithsonian Institution. It has been reported that Schepens assembled the prototype for his BIO from metal scraps collected from the streets of London during the German blitz. He was also a pioneer of surgical techniques such as scleral buckling for the repair of retinal detachments. The use of these techniques has raised the success of retinal reattachment surgery from 40% to 90%. During his career, Schepens wrote four books and over 340 research papers.|$|E
25|$|Ophthalmoscopy or fundus photography: Ophthalmoscopy is an {{examination}} of the retina in which the eye care professional: (1) looks through a slit lamp biomicroscope with a special magnifying lens that provides a narrow view of the retina, or (2) wearing a headset (indirect <b>ophthalmoscope)</b> with a bright light, looks through a special magnifying glass and gains a wide view of the retina. Hand-held ophthalmoscopy is insufficient to rule out significant and treatable diabetic retinopathy. Fundus photography generally captures considerably larger areas of the fundus, and has the advantage of photo documentation for future reference, as well as availing the image to be examined by a specialist at another location and/or time.|$|E

40|$|Background: With {{the advent}} of {{confocal}} scanning laser <b>ophthalmoscopes</b> (cSLO), fundus autofluorescence (FAF) resulting mainly from lipofuscin accumulation {{on the level of}} the retinal pigment epithelium can be visualised in vivo. Various cSLOs are available to document FAF. The authors analysed and compared results of FAF using three different instruments...|$|R
50|$|Many otoscopes used in doctors {{offices are}} {{wall-mounted}} {{while others are}} portable. Wall-mounted otoscopes are attached by a flexible power cord to a base, which serves to hold the otoscope when it's not in use and {{also serves as a}} source of electric power, being plugged into an electric outlet. Portable models are powered by batteries in the handle; these batteries are usually rechargeable and can be recharged from a base unit. Otoscopes are often sold with <b>ophthalmoscopes</b> as a diagnostic set.|$|R
500|$|In {{premature}} babies, {{signs of}} damage to the eye (retinopathy of prematurity, or ROP) are observed via an <b>ophthalmoscope</b> as a demarcation between the [...] and non-vascularised regions of an infant's retina. The degree of this demarcation is used to designate four stages: (I) the demarcation is a line; (II) the demarcation becomes a ridge; (III) growth of new blood vessels occurs around the ridge; (IV) the retina begins to detach from the inner wall of the eye (choroid).|$|E
2500|$|The {{progressive}} blindness of Usher syndrome {{results from}} retinitis pigmentosa. The photoreceptor cells usually start to degenerate {{from the outer}} [...] {{to the center of}} the retina, including the macula. The degeneration is usually first noticed as night blindness (nyctalopia); peripheral vision is gradually lost, restricting the visual field (tunnel vision), which generally progresses to complete blindness. The qualifier 'pigmentosa' reflects the fact that clumps of pigment may be visible by an <b>ophthalmoscope</b> in advanced stages of degeneration.|$|E
2500|$|Melanomas (choroidal, {{ciliary body}} and uveal) - [...] In {{the early stages}} {{there may be no}} {{symptoms}} (the person does not know there is a tumor until an ophthalmologist or optometrist looks into the eye with an <b>ophthalmoscope</b> during a routine test). As the tumor grows, symptoms can be blurred vision, decreased vision, double vision, eventual vision loss and if they continue to grow the tumor can break past the retina causing retinal detachment. Sometimes the tumor can be visible through the pupil.|$|E
40|$|A source with {{adjustable}} {{coherence length}} is devised {{and used to}} illuminate an OCT for en-face imaging of the retina of the human eye in vivo. Two modes of operation are described. The added capability of adjusting the depth resolution in real time while imaging patients is discussed. The utility of the OCT err-face imaging with adjustable coherence length for diagnostic is illustrated by images taken from {{the eye of a}} volunteer. Similar images with those produced by scanning laser <b>ophthalmoscopes</b> are produced {{for the first time in}} real time using OCT...|$|R
30|$|Such {{wide range}} of {{excitation}} spectra means that the fluorophores responsible for autofluorescence (AF) in the FAF imaging can vary depending on which excitation wavelength is used. The main excitation light more commonly used in commercial devices has been the blue light (BL) (λ 488  nm). However, more recently, green light (GL) (λ 514  nm and λ 532  nm) were introduced for clinical use in commercial confocal scanning laser <b>ophthalmoscopes</b> (cSLO) and adapted ultra-wide-field retinal imaging systems. In addition to potentially exciting different fluorophores, GL is less absorbed by macular pigments compared to BL and enhances LF signal in macula [14].|$|R
50|$|Emerging {{techniques}} for eye image capture include <b>ophthalmoscopes</b> {{that can be}} combined with mobile devices, increasing portability and accessibility to the general public. The introduction of full auto focusing retinal cameras {{has the potential to}} reduce the need for operators. Telehealth networks are growing in number, and advancements are being made in automated detection methods for diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. Teleophthalmology has the potential to improve access to screening and early treatment for a number of ocular conditions. It serves to identify patients who are at risk of various types of retinopathy and allows further evaluation and early management resulting in considerable economic benefit.|$|R
2500|$|About 6 to 67 {{million people}} have {{glaucoma}} globally. The disease affects about 2 {{million people in the}} United States. It occurs more commonly among older people. Closed-angle glaucoma is more common in women. Glaucoma has been called the [...] "silent thief of sight" [...] because the loss of vision usually occurs slowly {{over a long period of}} time. Worldwide, glaucoma is the second-leading cause of blindness after cataracts. The word [...] "glaucoma" [...] is from ancient Greek glaukos which means blue, green, or gray. In English, the word was used as early as 1587 but did not become commonly used until after 1850, when the development of the <b>ophthalmoscope</b> allowed people to see the optic nerve damage.|$|E

2500|$|Although Lowell {{was better}} known for his {{observations}} of Mars, he also drew maps of the planet Venus. He began observing Venus in detail in mid-1896 soon after the [...] Alvan Clark & Sons refracting telescope was installed at his new Flagstaff, Arizona observatory. Lowell observed the planet high in the daytime sky with the telescope's lens stopped down to 3 inches in diameter to reduce {{the effect of the}} turbulent daytime atmosphere. Lowell observed spoke-like surface features including a central dark spot, contrary to what was suspected then (and known now): that Venus has no surface features visible from Earth, being covered in an atmosphere that is opaque. It has been noted in a 2003 Journal for the History of Astronomy paper and in an article published in Sky and Telescope in July 2003 that Lowell's stopping down of the telescope created such a small exit pupil at the eyepiece, it may have become a giant <b>ophthalmoscope</b> giving Lowell an image of the shadows of blood vessels cast on the retina of his eye.|$|E

2500|$|The {{association}} of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and the eye disease glaucoma was first described by Englishman Richard Bannister in 1622: [...] "...that the Eye be grown more solid and hard, then naturally it should be...". Angle-closure glaucoma {{was treated with}} cataract extraction by John Collins Warren in Boston as early as 1806. [...] The invention of the <b>ophthalmoscope</b> by Hermann Helmholtz in 1851 enabled ophthalmologists {{for the first time}} to identify the pathological hallmark of glaucoma, the excavation of the optic nerve head due to retinal ganglion cell loss. The first reliable instrument to measure intraocular pressure was invented by Norwegian ophthalmologist Hjalmar August Schiøtz in 1905. About half a century later, Hans Goldmann in Berne, Switzerland, developed his applanation tonometer which still today - despite numerous new innovations in diagnostics - is considered the gold standard of determining this crucial pathogenic factor. In the late 20th century, further pathomechanisms beyond elevated IOP were discovered and became the subject of research like insufficient blood supply – often associated with low or irregular blood pressure – to the retina and optic nerve head.|$|E
2500|$|In {{patients}} with a clinical suspicion for Tay–Sachs disease, with any age of onset, the initial testing involves an enzyme assay to measure the activity of hexosaminidase in serum, fibroblasts, or leukocytes. [...] Total hexosaminidase enzyme activity is decreased in individuals with Tay-Sachs as is the percentage of hexosaminidase A. [...] After confirmation of decreased enzyme activity in an individual, confirmation by molecular analysis can be pursued. [...] All {{patients with}} infantile onset Tay–Sachs disease have a [...] "cherry red" [...] macula in the retina, easily observable by a physician using an <b>ophthalmoscope.</b> This red spot is a retinal area that appears red because of gangliosides in the surrounding retinal ganglion cells. The choroidal circulation is showing through [...] "red" [...] in this foveal region where all retinal ganglion cells are pushed aside to increase visual acuity. Thus, this cherry-red spot is the only normal part of the retina; it shows up {{in contrast to the}} rest of the retina. Microscopic analysis of the retinal neurons shows they are distended from excess ganglioside storage. Unlike other lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., Gaucher disease, Niemann–Pick disease, and Sandhoff disease), hepatosplenomegaly (liver and spleen enlargement) is not seen in Tay–Sachs.|$|E
2500|$|The German oculist Burchard Mauchart {{provided}} an early description in a 1748 doctoral dissertation {{of a case}} of keratoconus, which he called staphyloma diaphanum. However, {{it was not until}} 1854 that British physician John Nottingham (18011856) clearly described keratoconus and distinguished it from other ectasias of the cornea. Nottingham reported the cases of [...] "conical cornea" [...] that had come to his attention, and described several classic features of the disease, including polyopia, weakness of the cornea, and difficulty matching corrective lenses to the patient's vision. In 1859, British surgeon William Bowman used an <b>ophthalmoscope</b> (recently invented by Hermann von Helmholtz) to diagnose keratoconus, and described how to angle the instrument's mirror so as to best see the conical shape of the cornea. Bowman also attempted to restore vision by pulling on the iris with a fine hook inserted through the cornea and stretching the pupil into a vertical slit, like that of a cat. He reported that he had had a measure of success with the technique, restoring vision to an 18-year-old woman who had previously been unable to count fingers at a distance of 8inches (20cm).|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{adaptive}} optics <b>ophthalmoscopes</b> use wavefront sensing methods to characterize ocular aberrations for real-time correction.

We apply the classical and fast approach of template matching via cross-correlation, however, we do this in the domain of an orientation score rather than the usual image domain. As such, this approach makes it possible to efficiently detect multi-orientation patterns.
