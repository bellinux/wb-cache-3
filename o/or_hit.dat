Robert O’Neill, who later publicly identified himself as the SEAL who shot bin Laden, rolled {{through the door and}} confronted bin Laden inside the bedroom. Seymour Hersh reports that, according to his sources, bin Laden was found cowering and shot dead.|$|E

5|$|Spins {{earned in}} this round could be {{passed to the}} {{opponent}} with the higher total (if they were tied, the contestant passing the spins could choose the recipient). Contestants were required to use all spins passed until they used their spins <b>or</b> <b>hit</b> a Whammy; in the latter case, any remaining passed spins were transferred to their earned spin total. If a contestant using passed spins hit a space that awarded a spin (e.g., $3,000 + One Spin), that spin {{was added to the}} earned total. The contestant in the lead {{at the end of the}} game kept any cash and/or prizes in their bank at that time. Unlike Press Your Luck, three new contestants appeared on each episode.|$|E
5|$|The city {{consists}} of five areas: Lefty's Bar, a hotel casino, a 24-hour wedding chapel, a discothèque, and a convenience store. The player can walk between {{areas that are}} next to each other, but other areas can only be accessed by hailing a taxi, which costs the player money; {{failure to do so}} results in Larry's being mugged <b>or</b> <b>hit</b> by oncoming traffic. During {{the early stages of the}} game, Larry can survive most premature deaths. In the original release, a compartment opens beneath Larry's body and takes him to a laboratory where heroes from Sierra's computer games—such as King's Quest—are re-assembled; in the remake, Larry's remains are instead thrown inside a blender and reformed.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Origins {{is an open}} world action-adventure game {{incorporating}} stealth game tactics. Batman can use his cape {{to glide}} around Gotham City and the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to hard-to-reach ledges and extend his flight. Some gadgets from previous Arkham games are present {{at the start of}} Arkham Origins, while others become available during play. Returning gadgets include the Cryptographic Sequencer, used to hack security consoles; the Batclaw, used for hooking onto surfaces; the Batarang, a throwing weapon; the Remote Batarang, its remote-controlled counterpart; Explosive Gel, used to destroy weak surfaces and knock down enemies; Smoke Pellets, used for stealthy exits and entrances; the Disruptor, which can remotely disable guns and explosive mines, and the Grapnel Accelerator, an earlier version of the Grapnel Boost. New equipment in Batman's arsenal include the Remote Claw; this allows Batman to target two objects and pull them together, allowing him to throw enemies into each other <b>or</b> <b>hit</b> them with objects (tethering two walled points creates a tightrope for Batman to cross); Shock Gloves, which allow Batman to block electric attacks, disable some enemies and stun shielded ones, and short-circuit objects, and the Concussion Detonator, capable of stunning large enemy groups.|$|E

5|$|Barrow became {{manager of}} the Boston Red Sox in 1918. As the team lost many of its better players during World War I, Barrow {{encouraged}} owner Harry Frazee to purchase Stuffy McInnis, Wally Schang, Bullet Joe Bush, and Amos Strunk from the Philadelphia Athletics for $75,000 ($ in current dollar terms). During the season, Barrow feuded with his assistant, Johnny Evers, who undermined Barrow's leadership. The Red Sox won the 1918 World Series. Recognizing that star pitcher Babe Ruth was also a great power hitter, Barrow had Ruth pinch hit on days when he wasn't scheduled to pitch. When Ruth told Barrow that he could only pitch <b>or</b> <b>hit,</b> Barrow decided that Ruth's bat was more useful than his pitching, and transitioned him from a pitcher into an outfielder.|$|E
5|$|Defender is a {{two-dimensional}} side-scrolling shooting game {{set on the}} surface of an unnamed planet. The player controls a space ship as it navigates the terrain, flying either to the left or right. A joystick controls the ship's elevation, and five buttons control its horizontal direction and weapons. The object is to destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. Players are allotted three ships to progress through the game and are able to earn more by reaching certain scoring benchmarks. A ship is lost if it is hit by an enemy, <b>or</b> <b>hit</b> by an enemy projectile, or if a hyperspace jump goes wrong (as they randomly do). After exhausting all ships, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay {{remained}} largely similar to Press Your Luck, with contestants accumulating cash and prizes {{and attempting to}} avoid landing on a Whammy, who took away the winnings of any contestant who landed on it. At {{the start of the}} game, each of the three contestants was spotted $1,000 and took turns taking one spin at a time on the board. After each cycle of spins, additional Whammies were added to the board replacing cash values or prizes, and contestants chose to spin again or freeze with their score at that point. Landing on a Whammy in round one reduced that contestant's score to $0 and eliminated that contestant from further play in the round. Play continued until all three contestants froze <b>or</b> <b>hit</b> a Whammy. Cash values ranged from $100–$1,500 in round one, and prizes of similar values also appeared.|$|E

25|$|As {{opposed to}} other {{role-playing}} video games, {{the equivalent of}} health <b>or</b> <b>hit</b> points in LOTRO is morale and can be raised via food, rest, music, and battle cries. The game also places a fair emphasis on cooking and farming in its crafting system, in consistency with the characterization of Hobbits in Tolkien's writings.|$|E
25|$|The {{player has}} many acrobatic {{maneuvers}} at their disposal. Acrobatics {{are also used}} in combat to vault over enemies, <b>or</b> <b>hit</b> them into the air. Sometimes when performing these acrobatics, the player is aided by Elika. There are magical plates that allow the player to perform even more complicated acrobatic feats via Elika. If the player fails to signal Elika's magic, they fall off of the plate, sometimes to their death.|$|E

25|$|The {{objective}} is to remove (bear off) all of one's own checkers from the board before one's opponent can do the same. In the most often-played variants the checkers are scattered at first; as the game progresses they may be blocked <b>or</b> <b>hit</b> by the opponent. As the playing time for each individual game is short, it is often played in matches where victory is awarded to {{the first player to}} reach a certain number of points.|$|E
25|$|Cauliflower ear is a {{blood clot}} that forms under the skin in the ear, causing {{there to be a}} large bump in the ear; the bump tends to be {{extremely}} hard. To develop cauliflower ear one must be hit in the ear many times <b>or</b> <b>hit</b> hard for it to form into {{a blood clot}}. When having cauliflower ear it is important to get the ear drained of liquid that has built up. Otherwise the ear will require surgery to return to normal shape and size. The best way to prevent cauliflower is to wear headgear. This will protect your ears from taking hard hits.|$|E
25|$|In hand-to-hand combat, {{the player}} has three main attacks; light attack, heavy attack, and grapple. When the player grapples an opponent, {{they are free}} to throw them, <b>or</b> <b>hit</b> them with a number of light and/or heavy attacks. At certain points during combat, the enemy will be stunned, and a meter will appear {{on-screen}} prompting the player to press either the heavy attack or light attack button as much as possible within a set time. The more times the player presses the button, the more devastating the resulting special attack. The player can also toggle between different fighting styles, and switch to using a melee weapon at any time.|$|E

25|$|Hunting RPGs are a type {{of action}} RPG subgenre {{featuring}} the player and an optional team of up to three other players hunting down larger monsters with a set amount of time, using weapons crafted from the materials extracted from the map and/or from the monsters themselves. Unlike most RPG genres, the monsters have no health bars <b>or</b> <b>hit</b> points, but have stronger attack and defense stats, forcing the players to use survival items and coordinated strategies to eliminate a specific monster. First appeared in Capcom's Monster Hunter franchise, these games later expanded the hunting RPG genre into other games as well, such as Bandai Namco Entertainment's God Eater franchise.|$|E
25|$|On June 25, the Rays {{were once}} again unable to record a base hit in a game, this time in a 1–0 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks. The pitcher who threw the no-hitter was Edwin Jackson, who spent four seasons with the Rays until being traded after the 2008 season. This was the third no-hitter pitched against the Rays {{in less than a}} year, however unlike the {{previous}} two, this was not a perfect game, as 10 batters reached base by virtue of a walk, error, <b>or</b> <b>hit</b> by pitch. The Rays became the first team to be no-hit twice in the same season since the San Diego Padres in 2001.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, the {{corridor}} of uncertainty {{is an area where}} a cricket ball can pitch during a delivery: a narrow line on and just outside a batsman's off stump. The name is derived from the opinion that this is the area in which a batsman struggles most to determine whether to play forward or back, or to leave the delivery. If a batsman leaves the ball, there's a chance the ball will turn inward and either bowl him <b>or</b> <b>hit</b> him with an increased chance of leg before wicket. If a batsman plays the ball, there's a chance the ball will go to the outside instead, leading to an outside edge that can be easily caught.|$|E
