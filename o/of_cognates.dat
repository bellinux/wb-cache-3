25|$|The {{following}} is a very brief selection <b>of</b> <b>cognates</b> in basic vocabulary across the Uralic family, which may serve to give {{an idea of the}} sound changes involved.

25|$|To provide clarity, cross-linguistic {{influence}} can {{be understood}} as the various ways that two or more languages relate in the mind and affect a persons linguistic performance or development. Cross-linguistic effects of orthographic and semantic overlap between different languages <b>of</b> <b>cognates</b> and interlingual homographs were also reported in many priming studies. For example, Beauvillain and Grainger had French-English bilinguals make English lexical decisions on target strings primed by French words, which was told to the participants. The homographic primes were French words that were either semantically related to the English words (e.g., coin-money, where coin means corner in French) or not related. The results showed that the bilinguals responded faster in related conditions than unrelated conditions. Even though the participants knew that the prime words were always belonged to their French meaning, they were still affected by the English meaning of the homographic prime words. In the later studies, researchers masked the briefly presented prime words to prevent participants from using conscious strategies. For example, Sáchez-Casas et al. used Spanish-English bilinguals in a semantic categorization task on Spanish target words. They used three types of priming conditions: entirely identical cognates or non-cognates (rico-rico; pato-pato), translations <b>of</b> <b>cognates</b> or non-cognates (rich-rico; duck-pato) and non-word primes combined with cognate or non-cognate targets as a control condition (rict-rico vs. wuck-pato). They found that the bilinguals responded to the cognate translation conditions as fast as the identical conditions, but the non-cognate translation was as slow as the control conditions.|$|E

500|$|Similarly, {{the term}} {{diaphone}} {{can be used}} in discussions <b>of</b> <b>cognates</b> that occur in different languages due to borrowing. [...] Specifically, [...] used the term to refer to phonemes that are equated by speakers cross-linguistically because of similarities in shape and/or distribution. [...] For example, loanwords in Huave having [...] "diaphonic identification" [...] with Spanish include àsét ('oil', from Spanish [...] ) and kàwíy ('horse', from Spanish [...] ). This perception of sameness with native phonology means that speakers of the borrower language (in this case, Huave) will hear new features from the loaner language (in this case, Spanish) as equivalent to features of their own and substitute in their own when reproducing them. [...] In these interlanguage transfers, when phonemes or phonotactic constraints are too different, more extreme compromises may occur; for example, the English phrase Merry Christmas, when borrowed into Hawaiian, becomes mele kalikimaka.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of phonological and orthographic overlap in the recognition <b>of</b> <b>cognate</b> words by recording electrophysiological and behavioral data. One hundred and ninety-two words were selected: 96 cognate words listed according to their phonological and orthographic overlap vs. 96 noncognate words. Twenty-four proficient European Portuguese-English bilinguals performed a silent reading task with a masked priming paradigm. The results showed that phonology interacts with semantic activation at N 400 modulations. Phonological priming effects were dependent on the orthographic overlap <b>of</b> <b>cognate</b> words. Thus, the distinctive processing <b>of</b> <b>cognate</b> words seems {{to be due to}} their cross-linguistic similarity, which is consistent with a localist connectionist account on cognate representation and processing.

40|$|The T cell {{receptor}} (TCR) can recognize a variety <b>of</b> <b>cognate</b> peptide/major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) ligands and translate their affinity into distinct cellular responses.

This conformational change is induced in vivo and requires the expression <b>of</b> <b>cognate</b> MHC.

40|$|Dementia is an age-related {{problem that}} {{increases}} Medicaid expenditures {{by increasing the}} risk of nursing home placement and by raising prescription drug {{and other health care}} costs.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of global context and local context on the time course <b>of</b> activation <b>of</b> <b>cognate</b> homonyms for bilingual readers. Of interest was whether meaning frequency, context, and cross-language activation modulated the time course of activation of the subordinate meaning <b>of</b> <b>cognate</b> homonyms. Also, whether the subordinate bias effect would be altered or even eliminated by the combined influence of such contextual factors and cross-language activation. Eye movements of Spanish-English bilinguals were measured using an eye-tracking device while they read English paragraphs. The paragraphs contained cognate homonyms (e. g. novel/novela), cognate non-homonyms (e. g. plastic/plástico), non-cognate homonyms (e. g. slip), or non-cognate non-homonyms (e. g. hook) all in English. The topic of the paragraph (global context) was either biasing the subordinate meaning of the homonym or was neutral. The sentence where the target word was embedded (local context) had a preceding region that was either biasing the subordinate meaning or was neutral. Analyses revealed that that the combination of strong, contextual support and cross-language activation of the subordinate meaning resulted in the reduction of processing costs <b>of</b> <b>cognate</b> homonyms. ...|$|R
40|$|Conformational {{changes that}} occur upon {{substrate}} binding are known to play crucial roles in the recognition and specific aminoacylation <b>of</b> <b>cognate</b> tRNA by glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase.
