40|$|Oil-paper {{insulation}} {{system is}} widely used in power transformers and cables. Moisture is recognized to the ?enemy number one? for transformer insulation except for temperature [1]. Moisture is not {{only one of the}} most important factor which can accelerate the transformer paper insulation aging, but also has great effect on the dielectric properties of oil-paper insulation. In this paper, dielectric response and space charge behaviour of oil-paper insulation sample with three different moisture content were investigated using the frequency dielectric spectroscopy (FDS) and the pulsed electroacoustic (PEA) technique respectively. The influence of moisture on the dielectric response and space charge behaviour of <b>oil</b> <b>impregnated</b> paper insulation was analysed. Results show that moisture has much great effect on the FDS and space charge behaviour of <b>oil</b> <b>impregnated</b> paper insulation. In the range of 10 - 3 ~ 106 Hz, the relative permittivity of <b>oil</b> <b>impregnated</b> paper increases with its moisture content increased. And in the range of 10 - 2 ~ 106 Hz, the dielectric loss of <b>oil</b> <b>impregnated</b> paper also increases with its moisture content increasing. In addition, the higher the moisture concentration of the <b>oil</b> <b>impregnated</b> paper, the deeper the charge penetration into the insulation paper, and the larger quantity of hetero-charge was observed in the vicinity of positive electrode and homo-charge appears in the vicinity of negative electrode...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge about {{moisture}} content in <b>oil</b> <b>impregnated</b> paper insulation is essential when estimating remaining lifetime of power transformers. Direct evaluation of {{moisture content}} is rarely possible due to inaccessibility {{of the internal}} insulation system in transformers. Therefore, various indirect estimation techniques are utilized. Frequency domain spectroscopy (FDS) measurements of transformer insulation belong to this group. To perform high quality interpretation of results of FDS measurements a good knowledge on dielectric responses in <b>oil</b> <b>impregnated</b> pressboard and paper is required, especially as it refers to their variation with water content and temperature.

The influence of moisture on the dielectric {{response and}} space charge behaviour of <b>oil</b> <b>impregnated</b> paper insulation was analysed. Results {{show that the}} moisture has great effect on the FDS and space charge behaviour of <b>oil</b> <b>impregnated</b> paper insulation. In the frequency range of 10 - 2 ~ 106 Hz, the conductivity and the capacitance of <b>oil</b> <b>impregnated</b> paper increases with its moisture content. The space charge distribution of oil-paper sample with lower and higher moisture contents {{is very different from}} each other. The higher the moisture concentration of the <b>oil</b> <b>impregnated</b> paper, the easier the negative charge penetration into the insulation paper. There is a significant amount of positive charge accumulated at the paper-paper interface near to the cathode for oilpaper sample with lower moisture content. However, the positive charge appears in the middle layer paper for oil-paper sample with higher moisture content. Due to the high conductivity, the charge trapped in the oil-paper sample with higher moisture content disappears much faster than that in the oil-paper sample with lower moisture content after removing the voltage...|$|R
40|$|The {{resistivity}} of <b>oil</b> <b>impregnated</b> {{paper will}} decrease during its aging process.

The feasibility of this method are discussed in two aspects: reliability and sensitivity. Iterative inversion of paper resistivity was combined with finite element simulation. Both the bisection method and Newton’s method were used as iterative methods.

In order to consider the spatial distribution characteristic of paper aging and enhance the calculation accuracy, the resistivity calculation is expanded to a multivariate iteration based on Newton’s method, in order to consider the spatial distribution characteristic of paper aging and improve the calculation accuracy.

In this paper, the space charge behaviour in 1 mm thick impregnated pressboards is investigated by the means of pulsed electroacoustic method.

It has been demonstrated that the interface between dielectrics as well as electrode/dielectric behaves as a barrier to accumulate space charge significantly [2, 3]. It is, therefore, necessary to investigate space charge dynamics at the interface between <b>oil</b> and <b>impregnated</b> paper/pressboard, especially under combined AC and DC voltages and polarity reversal. In the present study, a purposed-built PEA system is established to measure space charge not only within the impregnated paper/pressboard bulk, but also at the interface between <b>impregnated</b> paper/pressboard and <b>oil.</b> A 15 mm thick aluminium plate is used as ground electrode, and acts as oil container with 5 mm in depth. Brass films with different thicknesses are applied to provide oil gaps between the upper electrode and the impregnated paper/pressboard sample.

30|$|Khattab {{found that}} as the linseed oil {{concentration}} in the cotton increases, the apparent activation energies of pyrolysis and oxidation decrease, due to hypothesised formation of free radicals from oxidation of linseed oil which then catalyse the pyrolysis reactions of cotton (Khattab et al. 1999). Linseed oil oxidation, which incorporates cross-linking reaction, involves oxygen consumption and induces increasing sample mass. Thus, the mass reading of a TGA instrument corresponds to a combined effect of mass-gaining (i.e., oxygen consumption) and mass-losing (i.e., emission of carbon oxides and water) reactions. For this reason, the gravimetric techniques alone are insufficient to probe the spontaneous ignition of linseed <b>oil</b> <b>impregnated</b> on the cellulose materials.
