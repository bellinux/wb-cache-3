25|$|The above formula {{assumes that}} the source is either {{directly}} approaching or receding from the observer. If the source approaches the observer at an angle (but still with a constant velocity), the <b>observed</b> <b>frequency</b> that is first heard {{is higher than the}} object's emitted frequency. Thereafter, there is a monotonic decrease in the <b>observed</b> <b>frequency</b> as it gets closer to the observer, through equality when it is coming from a direction perpendicular to the relative motion (and was emitted at the point of closest approach; but when the wave is received, the source and observer will no longer be at their closest), and a continued monotonic decrease as it recedes from the observer. When the observer is very close to the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is very abrupt. When the observer is far from the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is gradual.|$|E

25|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that Rømer was measuring a Doppler effect. The original effect discovered by Christian Doppler 166 years later refers to propagating electromagnetic waves.

This apparently anachronistic analysis implies that Rømer was measuring the ratio , where c is the speed of light and v is the Earth's orbital velocity (strictly, the component of the Earth's orbital velocity parallel to the Earth–Jupiter vector), and indicates that the major inaccuracy of Rømer's calculations was his poor knowledge of the orbit of Jupiter.|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} {{of the size of}} the convective core of main-sequence stars is usually dependent on the construction of models of stars. Here we introduce a method to estimate the radius of the convective core of main-sequence stars with masses between about 1. 1 and 1. 5 M_ from <b>observed</b> <b>frequencies</b> of low-degree p-modes. A formula is proposed to achieve the estimation. The values of the radius of the convective core of four known stars are successfully estimated by the formula. The radius of the convective core of KIC 9812850 estimated by the formula is 0. 140 ± 0. 028 R_. In order to confirm this prediction, a grid of evolutionary models were computed. The value of the convective-core radius of the best-fit model of KIC 9812850 is 0. 149 R_, which is in good agreement with that estimated by the formula from <b>observed</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The formula aids in understanding the interior structure of stars directly from <b>observed</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The understanding is not dependent on the construction of models.

2500|$|The most studied {{earthquake}} faults (such as the Nankai megathrust, the Wasatch fault, and the San Andreas fault) {{appear to}} have distinct segments. [...] The characteristic earthquake model postulates that earthquakes are generally constrained within these segments. As the lengths and other properties of the segments are fixed, earthquakes that rupture the entire fault should have similar characteristics. These include the maximum magnitude (which {{is limited by the}} length of the rupture), and the amount of accumulated strain needed to rupture the fault segment. [...] Since continuous plate motions cause the strain to accumulate steadily, seismic activity on a given segment should be dominated by earthquakes of similar characteristics that recur at somewhat regular intervals. For a given fault segment, identifying these characteristic earthquakes and timing their recurrence rate (or conversely return period) should therefore inform us about the next rupture; this is the approach generally used in forecasting seismic hazard. UCERF3 is a notable example of such a forecast, prepared for the state of California. Return periods are also used for forecasting other rare events, such as cyclones and floods, and assume that future frequency will be similar to <b>observed</b> <b>frequency</b> to date.|$|E

2500|$|Like other SSRIs, {{sertraline}} {{is associated}} with sexual side effects, including sexual arousal disorder and difficulty achieving orgasm. The <b>observed</b> <b>frequency</b> of sexual side effects depends greatly on whether they are reported by patients spontaneously, as in the manufacturer's trials, or actively solicited by the physicians. There have been several double-blind studies of sexual side effects comparing sertraline with placebo or other antidepressants. While nefazodone (Serzone), bupropion (Wellbutrin) and reboxetine (Edronax) did not have negative effects on sexual functioning, 67% of men on sertraline experienced ejaculation difficulties vs. 18% before the treatment (or 61% vs. 0% according to another paper). Similarly, {{in a group of}} women who initially did not have difficulties achieving orgasm, 41% acquired this problem during treatment with sertraline. A 40% rate of orgasm dysfunction (vs. 9% for placebo) on sertraline was observed in a mixed group in another study. Sexual arousal disorder, defined as [...] "inadequate lubrication and swelling for women and erectile difficulties for men", occurred in 12% of patients on sertraline as compared with 1% of patients on placebo. The mood improvement resulting from the treatment with sertraline sometimes counteracted these side effects, so that sexual desire and overall satisfaction with sex stayed the same as before the sertraline treatment. However, under the action of placebo the desire and satisfaction slightly improved.|$|E

60|$|Here, then, are two examples: in one, the {{greatest}} possible frequency of coincidence, with no instance whatever to the contrary, does {{not prove that}} there is any law; in the other, a much less frequency of coincidence, even when non-coincidence is still more frequent, does prove that there is a law. In both cases the principle is the same. In both we consider the positive frequency of the phenomena themselves, and how great frequency of coincidence that must of itself bring about, without supposing any connection between them, provided there be no repugnance; provided neither be connected with any cause tending to frustrate the other. If we find a greater frequency of coincidence than this, we conclude that there is some connection; if a less frequency, that there is some repugnance. In the former case, we conclude that one of the phenomena can under some circumstances cause the other, or that there exists something capable of causing them both; in the latter, that one of them, or some cause which produces one of them, is capable of counteracting the production of the other. We have thus to deduct from the <b>observed</b> <b>frequency</b> of coincidence as much as may be the effect of chance, that is, of the mere frequency of the phenomena themselves; and if any thing remains, what does remain is the residual fact which proves the existence of a law.|$|E
