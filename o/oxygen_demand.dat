5|$|The lake {{does not}} meet the National Water Quality Standards due to its high {{concentration}} of Biochemical <b>Oxygen</b> <b>Demand</b> (BOD). Considering the adverse impact on the lake water quality due to Eutrophication, anthropogenic pressures and holy rituals and tourism, a water quality study was specifically undertaken at four sites on a monthly basis for six months. The sampling sites were chosen to represent the pressure of pilgrims and other pollution inflows at the locations. The water samples were analysed for temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, total chlorophyll, biochemical <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> and chemical <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand.</b> The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline, chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites, and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen (at sites with greater pollution load) and high hardness (on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from surface run-off). During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair, a distinct co-relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed and the degree of water pollution in the lake. This has called for urgent remedial actions to be undertaken by all of the government agencies involved with the lake management, with people's participation.|$|E

Environmental groups, more than six government agencies, Native American tribes in the basin, and others have worked with the EPA to reduce pollution levels in the Klamath.|$|E

5|$|The clear-cutting {{of forests}} in the 19th century {{adversely}} affected {{the ecology of the}} Larrys Creek watershed and its water quality. Polluting industries on the creek and its tributaries during that period included coal and iron mines and tanneries. As of 2006, water quality in Larrys Creek is quite good, although two small unnamed tributaries of Roaring Run do receive acid mine drainage from an abandoned coal mine. Agricultural runoff is another source of pollution. Effluent limits for Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township for the 5-day test for carbonaceous biochemical <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> (CBOD5) are 25mg/L, while fecal coliform bacteria count limits are 200 per 100mL in May through September, and 2000 per 100mL in October through April.|$|E
5|$|A {{scientific}} study of the water quality parameters of physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics and role of phumdis in the Loktak Lake has been conducted by collecting surface water samples on monthly basis from 15 stations, representing 5 zones; northern, western, eastern, middle and southern. The test results indicated that water quality in the phumdi area was poor in {{the northern and southern}} zones of the lake; test results indicated low dissolved oxygen, low pH (normal range for pH in surface water systems is 6.5 to 8.5) high CO2 and high Biochemical <b>Oxygen</b> <b>Demand</b> (BOD) but the water quality was good in the open water area. Assessment of the total nitrogen content of the macrophyte species of phumdis indicated that the following were present in descending order: Salvinia natans (1.8%), Zizania latifolia (1.6%), Capillipedium sp. (1.3%), Brachiaria mutica (1.2%), Cyperus brevifolius (1.2%), Echinochloa stagnina (1.0%), Phragmites karka (1.0%) and Hedychium coranarium (0.94%). The test results confirmed the fact that the phumdis were efficient in absorbing nutrients from the lake water. However, they deteriorated water quality due to reduced light penetration and accumulation of organic matter in the lake ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Even though Croatia has {{sufficient}} water resources at its disposal, {{these are not}} uniformly distributed and public water supply network losses remain high—estimated at 44%. Between 2004 and 2008, the number of stations monitoring surface water pollution increased by 20%; the CEA reported 476 cases of water pollution in this period. At the same time organic waste pollution levels decreased slightly, which is attributed to the completion of new sewage treatment plants; their number increased 20%, reaching a total of 101. Nearly all of Croatia's groundwater aquifers are top quality, unlike the available surface water; the latter's quality varies in terms of biochemical <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> and bacteriological water analysis results. As of 2008, 80% of the Croatian population are served by the public water supply system, but only 44% of the population {{have access to the}} public sewerage network, with septic systems in use. Adriatic Sea water quality monitoring between 2004 and 2008 indicated very good, oligotrophic conditions along most of the coast, while areas of increased eutrophication were identified in the Bay of Bakar, the Bay of Kaštela, the Port of Šibenik and near Ploče; other areas of localized pollution were identified near the larger coastal cities. In the period between 2004 and 2008, the CEA identified 283 cases of marine pollution (including 128 from vessels), which was a drop of 15% relative to the period encompassed by the previous report, 1997 to August 2005.|$|E

25|$|Since {{all natural}} {{waterways}} contain bacteria and nutrients, almost any waste compounds introduced into such waterways will initiate biochemical reactions (such as shown above). Those biochemical reactions create what {{is measured in}} the laboratory as the biochemical <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> (BOD).

40|$|This {{study was}} {{supported}} by the Marine Alliance for Science and Technology for Scotland (Scottish Funding Council grant no. HR 09011),Myoglobin (Mb) is the classic vertebrate oxygen-binding protein present in aerobic striated muscles. It functions principally in oxygen delivery and provides muscle with its characteristic red colour. Members of the Antarctic icefish family (Channichthyidae) are widely thought to be extraordinary for lacking cardiac Mb expression, a fact that has been attributed to their low metabolic rate and unusual evolutionary history. Here, we report that cardiac Mb deficit, associated with pale heart colour, has evolved repeatedly during teleost evolution. This trait affects both gill-and air-breathing species from temperate to tropical habitats across a full range of salinities. Cardiac Mb deficit results from total pseudogenization in three-spined stickleback and is associated with a massive reduction in mRNA level in two species that evidently retain functional Mb. The results suggest that near or complete absence of Mb-assisted oxygen delivery to heart muscle is a common facet of teleost biodiversity, even affecting lineages with notable <b>oxygen</b> <b>demands.</b> We suggest that Mb deficit may affect how different teleost species deal with increased tissue <b>oxygen</b> <b>demands</b> arising under climate change.

40|$|The {{coronary}} microcirculation plays a {{key role}} in modulating blood supply to the myocardium. Several factors like myocardial <b>oxygen</b> <b>demands,</b> endothelial and neurogenic conditions determine its function. Although there is available evidence supporting microvascular dysfunction as an important cause of myocardial ischaemia, with both prognostic and symptomatic implications, its diagnosis and management in clinical practice is still relegated to a second plane. Both diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are hampered by the broadness of the concept of microvascular dysfunction, which fails addressing the plurality of mechanisms leading to dysfunction. Normal microcirculatory function requires both structural integrity of the microcirculatory vascular network and preserved signalling pathways ensuring adequate and brisk arteriolar resistance shifts in response to myocardial <b>oxygen</b> <b>demands.</b> Pathological mechanisms affecting these requirements include structural remodelling of microvessels, intraluminal plugging, extravascular compression or vasomotor dysregulation. Importantly, not every diagnostic technique provides evidence on which of these pathophysiological mechanisms is present or predominates in the microcirculation. In this paper we discuss the mechanisms of coronary microvascular dysfunction and the intracoronary tools currently available to detect it, as well as the potential role of each one to unmask the main underlying mechanis...|$|R
