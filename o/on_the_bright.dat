5|$|Deshasth Brahmans and Marathas {{observe the}} Champasashthi festival {{every year in}} honour of Khandoba. The festival begins <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> half of the Hindu month of Margshirsha. The images of Khandoba and Malla are cleaned and worshipped. For six days a fast is observed. On the seventh day the worshippers break their fast by a feast known as the Champasashtliiche parne. An {{invitation}} to this feast is regarded as an invitation from the god Khandoba himself and is harder to refuse.|$|E
5|$|In Orissa, {{the goddess}} is worshipped in the lying-in {{room on the}} sixth day after {{childbirth}}, on the 21st day after childbirth and on every subsequent birthday of the child until he or she reaches the age of sixteen. Shashthi is also prescribed to be worshipped the sixth day {{of each of the}} two lunar fortnights occurring each month; as part of the vrata rites, the worship occurring <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> fortnight of the month of Bhadrapada is {{the most important of these}} and holds the same status in Orissa as the Aranva-Shashthi ritual in Bengal. By these rites, it is believed a childless woman may gain offspring, while a mother may secure the longevity and welfare of her child by the grace of the goddess.|$|E
5|$|At the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children, Bart feels out {{of place}} among the other {{students}} with advanced academic skills. Meanwhile, Marge attempts to stimulate Bart with a little culture by taking the family to the opera. However, this proves disastrous as Bart and Homer are quite disruptive, much to Lisa's joy. Ostracized by his brilliant classmates, Bart visits his former school, where his old friends reject {{him because of his}} perceived intelligence. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> side, he enjoys newfound attention from Homer and he covers for them when Marge makes another attempt to stimulate Bart's brain by taking them to a film festival. After Bart's chemistry experiment explodes, filling the school lab with green goo, he confesses to Dr. Pryor that he switched tests with Martin. Dr. Pryor realizes that he was never a genius and has him readmitted to Springfield Elementary.|$|E

25|$|Many other Python {{sketches}} and songs are also existential in nature, questioning the importance we place on life ("Always Look <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bright</b> Side of Life") and other meaning-of-life related questioning.

Like Dalton and Mike, Winston is one of Red Green's friends and takes part in the day-to-day operations at Possum Lodge. He is always seen wearing a hard hat, a white button-down shirt, a bowtie and hip waders. He is generally upbeat and has a positive outlook on life, and is usually able to look <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> side of things {{even in the face}} of certain disaster. He is also a fan of self help speakers Anthony Anthony (whom he likes to quote) and Walter Mollusk.|$|E
25|$|After the 2001 general {{election}} he was moved, against his wishes, from the Foreign Office to be Leader of the House of Commons. This was {{widely seen as}} a demotion—although it is a Cabinet post, it is substantially less prestigious than the Foreign Office—and Cook nearly turned it down. In the event he accepted, and looking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> side welcomed the chance {{to spend more time}} on his favourite stage. According to The Observer, it was Blair's fears over political battles within the Cabinet over Europe, and especially the euro, which saw him demote the pro-European Cook.|$|E

25|$|Another account {{involves}} a 9th-century Ethiopian goat-herder, Kaldi, who, noticing the energizing effects when his flock nibbled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> red berries {{of a certain}} bush, chewed on the fruit himself. His exhilaration prompted him to bring the berries to a monk in a nearby monastery. But the monk disapproved of their use and threw them into the fire, from which an enticing aroma billowed, causing other monks to come and investigate. The roasted beans were quickly raked from the embers, ground up, and dissolved in hot water, yielding the world's first cup of coffee. Since this story is not known to have appeared in writing before 1671, 800 {{years after it was}} supposed to have taken place, it is highly likely to be apocryphal.|$|E
25|$|John McEnroe and Ashley Harkleroad (now {{divorced}} from Alex Bogomolov, Jr.) {{returned to the}} Sportimes for the 2007 season. They added Jesse Witten, Hana Šromová and Mirko Pehar in the roster draft. Chuck Adams returned to coach the team. Sometime after the season, Harkleroad and Adams were married. Their first child, a son named Charlie, was born in March 2009. In a highly competitive Eastern Conference, the Sportimes finished with 6 wins and 8 losses, only 2 matches behind the first-place New York Buzz, but out of playoff contention. The Sportimes finished in fourth place barely avoiding the basement by winning a standings tiebreaker over the Boston Lobsters. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> side, Witten was named WTT Male Rookie of the Year, the second consecutive season a Sportimes player had won the award.|$|E

40|$|Rats {{were trained}} to respond to <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> of two keys. Four animals were trained with food pellets and four with {{electrical}} brain stimulation. Each discrimination sequence was initiated when the animal broke a light beam {{at the rear of}} <b>the</b> chamber, turning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> key lights and starting a 30 -sec reinforcement period. An initial response <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> key was immediately reinforced, and further responses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> key were then intermittently reinforced. Any time the dimmer key was pressed, a 30 -sec timeout was introduced. During timeout, no response had any programmed consequence. When the reinforcement period or the timeout ended, a new discrimination sequence could be initiated. Daily 1 -hr training sessions were conducted, and after seven or eight sessions, all animals were at or near errorless performance levels. The luminance of <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> key was then systematically reduced, in seven steps, with two 30 -min test sessions at each step. Orderly psychometric functions were generated for individual animals. Initial acquisition, once position preferences were broken, was equally rapid for food and for brain-stimulation animals, and the two reinforcement procedures yielded comparable levels of brightness discriminability...|$|R
500|$|Vile Bodies, a satire <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bright</b> Young People of the 1920s, was {{published}} on 19 January 1930 and was Waugh's first major commercial success. Despite its quasi-biblical title, {{the book is}} dark, bitter, [...] "a manifesto of disillusionment", according to biographer Martin Stannard. As a best-selling author Waugh could now command larger fees for his journalism. Amid regular work for The Graphic, Town and Country and Harper's Bazaar, he quickly wrote Labels, a detached account of his honeymoon cruise with She-Evelyn.|$|E
500|$|A private {{memorial}} service for Chapman was held at St Bartholomew's on 3 December, two months after his death. The service began with a chorus of the hymn [...] "Jerusalem" [...] sung in Engrish with a mock Chinese accent. Cleese delivered a memorable eulogy to Chapman with a shock humour that he believed Chapman would have appreciated, and later became the first person at a televised British {{memorial service}} to say [...] "fuck". Palin also delivered a eulogy to Chapman, as did Idle, quipping that Chapman had decided to die rather than listen to Palin once again. Idle also led the other surviving Pythons and Chapman's close friends and family in a rendition of the song [...] "Always Look <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bright</b> Side of Life" [...] from The Life of Brian. Idle closed his remarks by saying: [...] "I'd just {{like to be the}} last person at this meeting to say 'fuck'." ...|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, Tapping {{found it}} a {{challenge}} to play a different character, as Carter and Magnus have differing personalities and points of view; [...] "after playing a character like Sam Carter for so long where her physicality is so comfortable – Sam is so comfortable in her own skin and Helen is this very sexual, more mysterious being. She has a much darker edge to her and {{it was sort of}} finding that because Carter always looks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> side and Helen has been around so long, and has seen so much of the evil in human society if you will." [...] Whilst filming the webisodes, Tapping wore a dark-haired wig, but when the television series was being shot, she dyed her hair to match the hair colour of the wig. Tapping spoke with an English accent throughout the run of the series. Although many of her relatives are from the United Kingdom and speak with British accents Tapping found the accent a challenge, as her character came from the Victorian era, which is a [...] "very specific way of speaking. She clings to that eccentricity a bit, to that Britishness." [...] The actress listened to several different voices, as she had to factor in the fact that Magnus lived all around the world.|$|E
500|$|Actress Natalie Dormer, who {{was cast}} to play Queen Margaery Tyrell in the show's second season, also made her final {{appearance}} {{as a main}} cast member for the series. In contrast to Chapman, Dormer found out about her character's impending death approximately {{six months before the}} rest of the cast, saying [...] "I requested while making season 5 that showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss release me from working on the show earlier than usual so I could do another project, and they ended up phoning me — and that was The Call. But I got it six months ahead of normal. They were like, 'We weren't going to tell you this for a few more months, but we're not going to release you now, so you can't do that job {{you really want to do}} and we're really sorry about that. But <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> side, we are going to release you proper in the not-so-distant future.' It was good news, bad news — no you can't do this, but don't worry, you're going to have lots more opportunities very soon." [...] Dormer also stated about her departure, [...] "It's the longest time I've ever spent playing a character. I'll always have a little yellow rose after my heart, and I think it was just the right length of time, to be honest. It's time for the Westeros story to move on and it's a perfect time for her to exit." ...|$|E
