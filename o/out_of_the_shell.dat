5|$|At a temple, which Meera visits as {{her daily}} ritual, Zeenat makes her first contact. Zeenat is {{too afraid to}} tell Meera {{the truth about the}} situation, and she does not reveal who she is or why she has come. Over a few weeks, they become good friends and spend most of the time together. Their {{friendship}} brings out the missing part in each of their personalities. In the process, Zeenat realizes helplessness; this is totally new to her forthright way of thinking. Meera, on the other hand, gets a glimpse of freedom; this brings her <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> of the traditions in her haveli and gives her a new perspective on her life.|$|E
5|$|Seals {{typically}} consume {{their prey}} underwater {{where it is}} swallowed whole. Prey that is too large or awkward is taken to the surface to be torn apart. The leopard seal, a prolific predator of penguins, is known to violently swing its prey back and forth until it is decapitated. The elaborately cusped teeth of filter-feeding species, such as crabeater seals, allow them to remove water before they swallow their planktonic food. The walrus is unique in that it consumes its prey by suction feeding, using its tongue to suck the meat of a bivalve <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell.</b> While pinnipeds mostly hunt in the water, South American sea lions are known to chase down penguins on land. Some species may swallow stones or pebbles for reasons not understood. Though they can drink seawater, pinnipeds get most of their fluid intake from the food they eat.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of hatching, the young start calling within the eggs. They have an egg-tooth {{at the tip of}} their snouts, which is {{developed}} from the skin, and that helps them pierce <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell.</b> Hearing the calls, the female usually excavates the nest and sometimes takes the unhatched eggs in her mouth, slowly rolling the eggs to help the process. The young is usually carried to the water in the mouth. She would then introduce her hatchlings to the water and even feed them. The mother would then take care of her young for over a year before the next mating season. In the absence of the mother crocodile, the father would act in her place {{to take care of the}} young. However, even with a sophisticated parental nurturing, young crocodiles have a very high mortality rate due to their vulnerability to predation. A group of hatchlings is called a pod or cr√®che and may be protected for months.|$|E

50|$|The chicks may {{be heard}} peeping {{in the hours}} before they hatch. Once the chicks have broken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shells,</b> <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debris is {{necessary}} in order to avoid predators. The mother may carry the eggshells to another location or consume a portion of them. Once hatched, the nestlings are active and have their eyes fully or half open; additionally they display a sparing cover of soft down feathers. The chicks are semiprecocial. By day 2, the hatchlings' bodily mass will double and {{they will be able to}} self-propel towards their mother's call. The young will hiss at an intruder.|$|R
5000|$|The species forages {{individually}} by hopping on {{the forest}} floor, then pausing to scan; leaves and soil are scratched by the feet and leaves may be flicked away by the bill. When feeding on snails, it breaks them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> using roots as an anvil. [...] Unlike the noisy pitta, it only uses roots and branches as anvils, not stones. Larger prey like large centipedes are shaken and dropped, then the bird retreats {{for a few seconds}} before repeating the process.|$|R

However, a vending machine prevents him from boarding, and he misses his train, giving him an hour to sample French seafood cuisine at the restaurant Le Train Bleu. While there, he eats a langoustine whole without peeling it, and drops the oysters, which he took a dislike to, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> and into his napkin, which he then pours into a woman's handbag.|$|R
60|$|In {{the yards}} {{were all the}} {{children}} and grandchildren of these eleven elders and they were of all sizes, from well-grown hens to tiny chickens just <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell.</b> About fifty fluffy yellow youngsters were at school, being taught good manners and good grammar by a young hen who wore spectacles. They sang in chorus a patriotic song of the Land of Oz, in honor of their visitors, and Aunt Em was much impressed by these talking chickens.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Victorian period lasted {{more than}} half a century. During this time England changed radically in almost all respects. One <b>of</b> these was <b>the</b> rising {{consciousness}} <b>of</b> women about their rights and potentials. Soon, the social awareness was transmitted to literature. In retrospect we find that many women writers emerged at this critical juncture in history when women were pleading to be given voice, to achieve their rights and to be given an opportunity to come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> quiet submission enforced upon them and achieve something of their own. Three sisters living deep in the Yorkshire moors surprised the world by taking part in this ongoing struggle. This article attempts to evaluate their contributions towards achieving women‚Äôs rights in English history.

5000|$|Peppermint Patty and Marcie {{attempt to}} color eggs, {{but as it}} is Marcie's first time, {{she does not know}} how to prepare the eggs properly.

60|$|My dear Friend,--I do {{hope that}} you may not be very angry, but papa thinks--and, indeed, I think--that as I have already had two proof sheets and forty-eight pages, and the {{printers}} have gone on {{to the rest of the}} poem, it would not be very welcome to them if we were to ask them to retrace their steps. Besides, I would rather--I for myself, I--that you had the whole poem at once and clearly printed before you, to insure as many chances as possible of your liking it. I am promised to see the volume completed in three weeks from this time, so that the dreadful moment of your reading it--I mean the 'Seraphim' part of it--cannot be far off, and perhaps, the season being a good deal advanced even now, you might not, on consideration, wish me to retard the appearance of the book, except for some very sufficient reason. I feel very nervous about it--far more than I did when my 'Prometheus' crept out [of] the Greek, or I myself <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell,</b> in the first 'Essay on Mind.' Perhaps this is owing to Dr. Chambers's medicines, or perhaps to a consciousness that my present attempt is actually, and will be considered by others, more a trial of strength than either of my preceding ones.|$|E
