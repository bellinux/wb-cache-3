5|$|After an {{erroneous}} scouting {{report of}} approaching Mexican troops, Baker burned San Felipe de Austin {{to the ground}} on March 30. When Baker claimed Houston had given him an order to do so, Houston denied it. Houston's account was that the residents burned their own property to keep it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> the Mexican army. San Felipe de Austin's residents did as those before them in escaping the Mexican army, and fled to the east.|$|E
5|$|The city {{reached its}} peak in the 12th century, with a {{population}} of approximately 200,000. It was the centre of administrative power in Egypt, until it was ordered burnt in 1168 by its own vizier, Shawar, to keep its wealth <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> the invading Crusaders. The remains of the city were eventually absorbed by nearby Cairo, which had been built to the north of Fustat in 969 when the Fatimids conquered the region and created a new city as a royal enclosure for the Caliph. The area fell into disrepair for hundreds of years and was used as a rubbish dump.|$|E
5|$|During his {{campaign}} and presidency, President George W. Bush endorsed {{the idea of}} background checks at gun shows. Bush's position was that the gun show loophole should be closed by federal legislation since the gun show loophole was created by previous federal legislation. President Bush ordered {{an investigation by the}} U.S. Departments of Health, Education, and Justice {{in the wake of the}} Virginia Tech shootings in order to make recommendations on ways the federal government can prevent such tragedies. On January 8, 2008 he signed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA) into law. Goals and objectives that the NIAA sought to address included: The gap in information available to NICS about such prohibiting mental health adjudications and commitments. Filling these information gaps will better enable the system to operate as intended, to keep guns <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> persons prohibited by federal or state law from receiving or possessing firearms.|$|E

5|$|The {{towns of}} Gonzales and San Felipe de Austin were burned {{to keep them}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> the Mexican army. Santa Anna was intent on {{executing}} members of the Republic's interim government, who fled from Washington-on-the-Brazos to Groce's Landing to Harrisburg and New Washington. The government officials eventually escaped to Galveston Island, and Santa Anna burned the towns of Harrisburg and New Washington when he failed to find them. Approximately 5,000 terrified residents of New Washington fled from the Mexican army. After {{a little over a}} month of training the troops, Houston reached a crossroads where he ordered some of them to escort the fleeing refugees farther east while he took the main army southeast to engage the Mexican army. The subsequent Battle of San Jacinto resulted in the surrender of Santa Anna and the signing of the Treaties of Velasco.|$|E
5|$|Three {{additional}} system {{models were}} created by other electronics companies. Working with Sega, JVC released the Wondermega on April 1, 1992, in Japan, at an initial retail price of ¥82,800 (or US$620). The system was later redesigned by JVC and released as the X'Eye in North America in September 1994. Designed by JVC to be a Genesis and Sega CD combination with high-quality audio, the Wondermega's high price kept it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> average consumers. Likewise {{was the case with}} the Pioneer LaserActive, which was also an add-on that required an attachment developed by Sega, known as the Mega-LD pack, in order to play Genesis and Sega CD games. Though the LaserActive, developed by Pioneer Corporation, was lined up to compete with the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, the combined system and Mega-LD pack retailed at nearly $1600, becoming a very expensive option for Sega CD players. Aiwa also released the CSD-GM1, a combination Genesis/Sega CD unit built into a boombox.|$|E
5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

25|$|While {{a normal}} leg break spins from the leg to the off side, {{away from a}} {{right-handed}} batsman, a googly spins the other way, from off to leg, into a right-handed batsman (and is distinct from an off break delivery). The bowler achieves this change of spin by bending the wrist sharply from the normal leg break delivery position. When <b>the</b> ball rolls <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> (from <b>the</b> side near the little finger, as in a normal leg break), it emerges with clockwise spin (from <b>the</b> bowler's point <b>of</b> view). A googly may also be achieved by bowling the ball as a conventional leg break, but spinning the ball further with the fingers just before it is released.|$|R
25|$|Before retreating, Romanian troops {{burned down}} the oil wells at Ploiești {{along with the}} {{surrounding}} wheat fields so as to keep them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> the Central Powers.

25|$|Kitsikis {{regards the}} Greek {{language}} as {{the cornerstone of}} planetary civilization, and he thus deems it an honour for one {{to be able to}} write in Greek.

He defends the continued use of polytonic Greek, traditional spelling and the freedom to write in any literary tone. He regards as erroneous only the implementation of a Greek form not used from the time of Homer to today.|$|E
25|$|The estoc {{became popular}} {{because of its}} ability to thrust into the gaps between plates <b>of</b> armour. <b>The</b> grip was {{sometimes}} wrapped in wire or coarse animal hide to provide a better grip and to make it harder to knock a sword <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> user's <b>hand.</b>|$|R
25|$|Highly skilled leg spin bowlers {{are also}} able to bowl {{deliveries}} that behave unexpectedly, including the googly, which turns the opposite way to a normal leg break and the topspinner, which does not turn but dips sharply and bounces higher than other deliveries. A few leg spinners such as Abdul Qadir, Anil Kumble, Shane Warne and Mushtaq Ahmed have also mastered the flipper, a delivery that like a topspinner goes straight on landing, but floats through the air before skidding and keeping low, often dismissing batsmen leg before wicket or bowled. Another variation in <b>the</b> arsenal <b>of</b> some leg spinners is the slider, a leg break pushed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> somewhat faster, {{so that it does}} not spin as much, but travels more straight on.|$|R

25|$|The bill {{establishing}} the union was carried through its final stages by substantial majorities.

25|$|William Turner's Historia Avium ("History of Birds"), {{published}} at Cologne in 1544, was {{an early}} ornithological work from England. He noted the commonness of kites in English cities where they snatched food <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> children. He included folk beliefs {{such as those of}} anglers. Anglers believed that the osprey emptied their fishponds and would kill them, mixing the flesh of the osprey into their fish bait. Turner's work reflected the violent times that he lived in and stands in contrast to later works such as Gilbert White's The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne that were written in a tranquil era.|$|E
25|$|Neutrals {{led by the}} United States set up the Commission for Relief in Belgium, {{headed by}} American {{engineer}} Herbert Hoover. It shipped in large quantities of food and medical supplies, which it tried to reserve for civilians and keep <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> the Germans. Many businesses collaborated with the Germans, and some women cohabitated with them. They were treated roughly {{in a wave of}} popular violence in November and December 1918. The government set up judicial proceedings to punish the collaborators. In 1919 the king organized a new ministry and introduced universal male suffrage. The Socialists—mostly poor workers—benefited more than the more middle class Catholics and Liberals.|$|E
50|$|Blitz {{is played}} in rounds, with all players playing simultaneously. Each player {{is in control}} of two letter piles.
