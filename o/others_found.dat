5|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} sequel's {{additional}} features and variety, while <b>others</b> <b>found</b> its gameplay unoriginal {{compared to the}} original and its contemporaries. Critics lauded the multiplayer mode, which some said was a reason alone to buy the game. The game was released in Rare's 2015 Rare Replay compilation for Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|Some reviewers {{praised the}} scenery and overall {{production}} quality, considering the film {{an improvement over}} staged adaptations of the novel. <b>Others</b> <b>found</b> the scenery irrelevant and the story confusing. Despite mixed reviews, the film was financially successful, reportedly setting box office records. The following year, a film adaptation of an unrelated Evans novel, Beulah, was marketed as a sequel. As with most Balboa films, St. Elmo is now believed lost.|$|E
5|$|The film premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival on September 6, 2013, and had {{a limited}} release in the United States on March 14, 2014, {{expanding}} to a wide release on March 28.

5|$|The film premiered on June 19, 1998, in the United States, and {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from critics. Although some enjoyed {{the style and}} effects of the film, <b>others</b> <b>found</b> the plot confusing and viewed it {{as little more than}} an extended episode of the series. A sequel, entitled , was released ten years later.|$|E
5|$|Flynn {{has divided}} film critics. While some reviewers enjoyed the character's {{refreshing}} humor, rebelliousness and sarcasm {{in comparison to}} traditional Disney princes, <b>others</b> <b>found</b> his personality to be annoying and obnoxious, while panning his narration. Additionally, Flynn has also been strongly {{accused of being a}} marketing tool exploited by Disney to attract a larger male audience to Tangled. However, both the character's romantic comedy-esque relationship with Rapunzel and Levi's vocal performance have received widespread acclaim. Flynn is also considered to be among the most appealing Disney heroes by Vanity Fair, E! and Cosmopolitan.|$|E
5|$|Gangsta rap {{is a kind}} of hip hop, most {{importantly}} characterized by a lyrical focus on macho sexuality, physicality and a dangerous, criminal image. Though the origins of gangsta rap {{can be traced back to}} the mid-1980s raps of Philadelphia's Schoolly D and the West Coast's Ice-T, the style is usually said to have begun in the Los Angeles and Oakland area, where Too Short, NWA and <b>others</b> <b>found</b> their fame. This West Coast rap scene spawned the early 1990s G-funk sound, which paired gangsta rap lyrics with a thick and hazy tone, often relying on samples from 1970s P-funk; the best-known proponents of this sound were the breakthrough rappers Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg.|$|E

5|$|Lightning has {{received}} mixed commentary from critics—much of it relating to her cold personality, which {{was compared to}} that of Final Fantasy VIIs protagonist Cloud Strife. She was criticized for her relative absence in XIII-2. Her role in Lightning Returns had a mixed reception: some critics saw her as underdeveloped and unlikable, while <b>others</b> <b>found</b> her better developed and more human than in previous games. Lightning later appeared on lists, compiled by video game publications, of the best characters in the Final Fantasy series and in video games as a whole. She has been received favorably in polls of public opinion by Famitsu, Square Enix, and other organizations.|$|E
5|$|Mercy Point {{was placed}} on hiatus after only three episodes were aired, and was {{replaced}} by the reality television seriesAmerica's Greatest Petsand the sitcomReunited. The show suffered from low ratings,with an average of two million viewers. The final four episodes of the series were broadcast in two 2-hour blocks on Thursday nights in July 1999. It has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, or made available on online-streaming services. Critical response to Mercy Pointwas mixed; some commentators praised its characterization and use of science-fiction elements, while <b>others</b> <b>found</b> it to be uninteresting and unoriginal. Callaway stated that he had the potential story arcs for the full first season already planned before the show's cancellation.|$|E
5|$|Speed Buggy {{lasted for}} one {{season with a}} total of sixteen episodes. Despite its short run, it was {{broadcast}} on the Big Three television networks years after its original run as the channels had purchased syndication rights. It was speculated that the series acquired a fan base due to its frequent rotation on American television. Critical response to Speed Buggy was generally positive; some critics enjoyed its shared themes with Josie & the Pussycats and Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, while <b>others</b> <b>found</b> it unmemorable and overly repetitive. It has since been released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.' Archive Collection on a four disc set.|$|E

5|$|Suzuki was {{inspired}} to write a biography of a tree when he noticed a Douglas-fir with an uncharacteristic curve in its trunk and speculated what caused it to grow into that shape. Suzuki studied the topic {{with the help of}} a research assistant and solicited Grady to help write the book. Vancouver publishers Greystone Books released the book in September 2004. In the Canadian market, it peaked at number three in the Maclean's and the National Post non-fiction best seller lists and was nominated for several awards. In February 2005 it was published in Australia by Allen & Unwin. The premise and writing were well received by critics. While several reviewers found that the authors succeeded in using accessible language, <b>others</b> <b>found</b> it too technical.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{translated}} into 28 languages and released simultaneously around the world by 33 publishers. In the Canadian market, it peaked on the best seller lists at number one in Maclean's and number two in The Globe and Mail, but did not place on the New York Times Best Seller List in the American market. Some critics found the writing to be typical of Atwood or even one of her finest works, while <b>others</b> <b>found</b> some aspects, like the chorus of maids, disagreeable.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan had}} been to take the songs out on the road, but no new tour transpired. Thus, Bush {{deliberately}} aimed for a live-band feel, with less of the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums and {{which would have been}} too difficult to re-create on stage. The result alienated some of her fan base, who had enjoyed the intricacy of her earlier compositions, but <b>others</b> <b>found</b> a new complexity in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed.|$|E

5|$|The soundtrack {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics; while several {{felt that the}} music was good and keeping in tone with the game, <b>others</b> <b>found</b> it to be odd and shallow. Several reviewers attributed the change {{to the lack of}} participation by Uematsu. Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission Original Soundtrack and Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection, on the other hand, were very well received by critics, who felt that they were far superior to the original soundtrack. The singles for the soundtrack were poorly received by critics, who found a few of the songs to be enjoyable but all of the singles to be overpriced.|$|E
5|$|Two {{other factors}} {{have often been}} cited in Stroma's depopulation: the {{building}} of the nuclear power station at nearby Dounreay in the 1950s, which created many new jobs on the mainland, and in the same decade the construction of a harbour on Stroma on which many islanders were employed. Although it has been claimed that this gave the islanders the incentive (and the means) to leave, local historian Donald A. Young points out that of islanders who left after 1945, only one went directly from Stroma to Dounreay. Most of the rest either continued fishing or carried on crofting on the mainland, while <b>others</b> <b>found</b> alternative jobs. Some ex-islanders eventually found jobs at Dounreay, but they had already moved to the mainland for work or education.|$|E
5|$|Harclay's most {{prominent}} achievement {{came with the}} Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322. The battle {{was the culmination of}} an ongoing struggle between King Edward II and his most powerful earl, Thomas of Lancaster. The conflict stemmed from disagreement over the handling of the war with Scotland; Lancaster, and many <b>others,</b> <b>found</b> the king's war effort lacking. After failing to incite an insurrection against the king, Lancaster was in March 1322 fleeing northwards from the royal army. Meanwhile, Harclay, as sheriff of Cumberland, was ordered by the king to levy the forces of the northern counties of Cumberland and Westmorland, and move south. His orders were to meet up with the royal army, but while stopping at the town of Ripon in Yorkshire, he received intelligence that Lancaster would arrive at nearby Boroughbridge the next day. Harclay decided to take the initiative, and occupy the bridge that would prevent Lancaster's passage across the River Ure.|$|E

5|$|However, <b>others</b> <b>found</b> {{that the}} {{bundling}} {{of the games}} was a sensible business decision, most highlighting {{the risk that the}} sales of Remastered could overshadow those of Infinite Warfare and result in direct competition between the two. Stephen Wright of Gamespresso, meanwhile, agreed with Activision based around the impulsiveness of the Call of Duty fanbase, writing that due to the series' popularity, many of the individuals who felt discontent towards a new title would still choose to buy it regardless. As such, Activision had released the bundle with the knowledge that fans would certainly purchase Infinite Warfare in order to obtain a remaster of Modern Warfare, a game that was held in such high regard. While Wright did disagree with having to pay for an unwanted game in order to obtain another, he expressed faith that the bundle would be good value for money.|$|E
5|$|IGN's Chloi Rad commended the game's {{blend of}} drama and action, {{as well as}} the {{realistic}} depiction of violence, and felt that the game's setting and period helped demonstrate the spirit of the revolution. Andrew Todd of Gameplanet praised the game's manner of dealing with issues like inequality, theocracy, and causes of anti-Americanism, and noted that they help create the atmosphere of the story and setting. Eurogamer's Jeffrey Matulef found the narrative's moral ambiguity refreshing, particularly the depiction of corrupting good people. He felt that the development team being primarily Iranian added to the game's authenticity. Kotakus Evan Narcisse similarly appreciated the ambiguity, noting its close imitation to the era. The choices presented in the game split reviewers; some found them important and scary, while <b>others</b> <b>found</b> them ultimately inconsequential.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} sack, rumours reached the caliph that Theophilos was {{advancing}} to attack him. Mu'tasim set {{out with his}} army a day's march along {{the road in the}} direction of Dorylaion, but encountered no sign of a Byzantine attack. According to al-Tabari, Mu'tasim now pondered extending his campaign to attack Constantinople, when news reached him of a conspiracy headed by his nephew, al-Abbas ibn al-Ma'mun. Mu'tasim was forced to cut short his campaign and return quickly to his realm, leaving intact the fortresses around Amorium as well as Theophilos and his army in Dorylaion. Taking the direct route from Amorium to the Cilician Gates, both the caliph's army and its prisoners suffered in the march through the arid countryside of central Anatolia. Some captives were so exhausted that they could not move and were executed, whereupon <b>others</b> <b>found</b> the opportunity to escape. In retaliation, Mu'tasim, after separating the most prominent among them, executed the rest, some 6,000 in number.|$|E
