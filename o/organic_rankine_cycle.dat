25|$|Watt's Expansion Engine is {{generally}} considered as of historic interest only. There are however some recent developments which {{may lead to a}} renaissance of the technology. Today, there is an enormous amount of waste steam and waste heat with temperatures between 100 and 150°C generated by industry. In addition, solarthermal collectors, geothermal energy sources and biomass reactors produce heat in this temperature range. There are technologies to utilise this energy, in particular the <b>Organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>Cycle.</b> In principle, these are steam turbines which do not use water but a fluid (a refrigerant) which evaporates at temperatures below 100°C. Such systems are however fairly complex. They work with pressures of 6 to 20 bars, so that the whole system has to be completely sealed.|$|E

In the present study, one dimensional model of radial expanders {{in conjunction with a}} thermodynamic model of <b>organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycles</b> is prepared. After verification, by defining thermal efficiency of the cycle and size parameter of a radial turbine as the objective functions, a multi-objective optimization was conducted regarding tension and vibration constraints for 4 different organic working fluids (R 22, R 245 fa, R 236 fa and N-Pentane). In addition to mass flow rate, evaporator temperature, maximum pressure of cycle and turbo-machinery design parameters are selected as the decision variables. Regarding Pareto fronts, by a little increase in size of radial expanders, it is feasible to reach high efficiency. Moreover, by assessing the distribution of decision variables, the variables that {{play a major role in}} trending between the objective functions are found.

A thermodynamic analysis of <b>organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycles</b> using five fluids (freon- 11 freon- 12, propane, butane, and isopentane) is presented to establish the feasibility of using organic cycles at the lower temperatures commonly encountered in waste heat streams (100 to 280 degrees Celsius). Performance with the five fluids is evaluated to establish guidelines for working fluid choice and identify important thermodynamic properties. An economic analysis is included to provide estimates of rate of return for a typical installation. Maximum energy recovery is achieved for fluids with a critical temperature less than the waste heat temperature so that supercritical boiler pressures can be maintained. Of the fluids evaluated, freon- 12 and propane offer the best performance below 180 ??C, while butane is the best choice for temperatures above 180 ??C. Acceptable rates of return (20...|$|R
