5|$|The bomb sight {{was also}} {{supplied}} with the Emergency Computor, a simple circular slide rule for use when the main computor stopped working. In {{this case the}} bomb aimer would dial in the same basic parameters on the various disks, and read out the proper sighting angle at the bottom. Wind had to be estimated and calculated by hand. The angles were then entered manually into the sight; the drive cables were clutched out, the aiming angle entered using the <b>operating</b> <b>handle,</b> and the drift angle set by a small locking screw.|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with the}} M1885 Remington-Lee and the M1892 Springfield, the M1895 Lee {{was one of}} the first {{infantry}} weapons adopted by U.S. forces to be equipped with a repeating action. [...] To operate the straight-pull mechanism, the <b>operating</b> <b>handle</b> is first pulled up at an angle to disengage the bolt and its wedge lock, then pulled sharply to the rear to extract and eject the spent case. [...] Pushing forward on the bolt handle strips a round from the magazine; as the bolt is slammed home, the bolt's wedge lock seats into place, the firing pin is cocked, and the fresh cartridge is seated in the chamber. [...] Once the M1895 is cocked, the rifle's bolt cannot be retracted unless the bolt-release lever is pushed downward. [...] This prevents opening of the action caused by an inadvertent bump or contact to the bolt handle. [...] The rifle has a safety located on the top of the receiver, which is released by pushing down with the thumb on the safety button.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{military}} rifles of the day, the Lee was not {{fitted with a}} turning bolt. [...] Though frequently described as a straight-pull action, the M1895 Lee actually uses a camming action in which a steel wedge or locking block beneath the bolt is forced into a recessed area in the receiver. [...] Pulling the <b>operating</b> <b>handle</b> back causes the bolt to rock back and upwards, freeing a locking stud on the receiver and unlocking the bolt. [...] The firing pin cocked on final closing where the resistance would be overcome by the forward inertia of closing the action. [...] Once the rather odd [...] "up and back" [...] bolt movement was mastered, {{and as long as}} the action was clean and well-lubricated, it worked fairly well, though the slightly inclined opening stroke proved awkward for some men when the rifle was operated from the shoulder. [...] Despite this, the Navy's Chief of Ordnance noted with approval that the Lee rifle could be fired [...] "with great rapidity", achieving a rate of fire considerably faster than most existing turn-bolt rifles of the day.|$|E

2500|$|The Lee–Enfield rifle {{was derived}} from the earlier Lee–Metford, a {{mechanically}} similar black-powder rifle, which combined James Paris Lee's rear-locking bolt system with a barrel featuring rifling designed by William Ellis Metford. The Lee action cocked the striker on the closing stroke of the bolt, making the initial opening much faster and easier compared to the [...] "cock on opening" [...] (i.e., the firing pin cocks upon opening the bolt) of the Mauser Gewehr 98 design. The bolt has a relatively short bolt throw and features rear-mounted lugs and the bolt <b>operating</b> <b>handle</b> places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger at a favorable ergonomic position close to the operator's hand. The action features helical locking surfaces (the technical term is interrupted threading). This means that final head space is not achieved until the bolt handle is turned down all the way. The British probably used helical locking lugs to allow for chambering imperfect or dirty ammunition and that the closing cam action is distributed over the entire mating faces of both bolt and receiver lugs. This is one reason the bolt closure feels smooth. The rifle was also equipped with a detachable sheet-steel, 10-round, double-column magazine, a very modern development in its day. Originally, the concept of a detachable magazine was opposed in some British Army circles, as some feared that the private soldier might be likely to lose the magazine during field campaigns. Early models of the Lee–Metford and Lee–Enfield even used a short length of chain to secure the magazine to the rifle. To further facilitate rapid aimed fire the rifle can be cycled by most rifleman without loss of sight picture.|$|E

50|$|The {{screw jack}} {{consists}} of two simple machines in series; the long <b>operating</b> <b>handle</b> serves as a lever whose output force turns the screw. So the mechanical advantage is increased by a longer handle {{as well as a}} finer screw thread. However, most screw jacks have large amounts of friction which increase the input force necessary, so the actual mechanical advantage is often only 30% to 50% of this figure.|$|E

This paper presents one of possible solving approaches to the problem, considering the optimal assignment of resources (batteries and vehicles) to material handling tasks.

50|$|A steam {{operated}} firedoor was fitted, {{permitting the}} stoker {{to operate the}} door {{by means of a}} foot treadle, while an auxiliary <b>operating</b> <b>handle</b> allowed the driver to operate the door in situations where this was found more convenient.

The relief valve usually has a manual <b>operating</b> <b>handle</b> to allow testing and the flushing of contaminants (such as grit) that may cause the valve to leak under otherwise-normal operating conditions.|$|E

50|$|Manual hoists, or hand winches, are {{typically}} {{composed of a}} drum, gear box, and crank (<b>operating</b> <b>handle).</b> A worm gear is commonly used to provide mechanical advantage as the crank is turned, which coils a single line around a smooth or helically-grooved drum.

From the clew, the lift lines run over a head block and loft blocks down to a batten. The clew may be wire-guided to limit lateral play. Drill-operable hand winches permit the handle to be removed so that an electric drill may operate the hoist.|$|E
50|$|Camera dollies {{have several}} {{steering}} mechanisms {{available to the}} dolly grip. The typical mode is rear-wheel steering, where the front wheels remain fixed, while the wheels closest to the <b>operating</b> <b>handle</b> are used to turn. A second mode, round steering, causes the front wheels to turn {{in the opposite direction}} from the rear wheels. This mode allows the dolly to move in smooth circles and is frequently used when the dolly is on curved track. A third mode, called crab steering, is when the front wheels steer {{in the same direction as}} the rear wheels. This allows the dolly to move in a direction diagonal to the front end of the dolly.|$|E
50|$|To {{load the}} gun, shells are {{fed into the}} bottom of the action, where they are pushed into the tubular magazine. Most A-5s have {{removable}} plugs in the magazine which prevent more than three shells from being loaded (two in the magazine, plus one in the chamber) to comply with U.S. Federal migratory waterfowl laws, as well as some state hunting regulations. With the plug removed, the total capacity is five rounds. If the chamber is open (the <b>operating</b> <b>handle</b> is drawn back) the first shell loaded into the magazine tube will go directly into the chamber (there is a manual bolt closing button under the ejection port), the bolt then closes, and all further shells fed into the gun go into the magazine.|$|E
5000|$|The M1 rifle is fed by an [...] "en bloc" [...] clip {{which holds}} eight rounds of [...]30-06 Springfield ammunition. When the last {{cartridge}} is fired, the rifle ejects the clip and locks the bolt open. The M1 is {{now ready to}} reload. Once the clip is inserted, the bolt snaps forward on its own as soon as thumb pressure is released from the top round of the clip, chambering a round and leaving it ready to fire. Although it is not absolutely necessary, the preferred method is to place {{the back of the}} right hand against the <b>operating</b> rod <b>handle</b> and press the clip home with the right thumb; this releases the bolt, but the hand restrains the bolt from slamming closed on the operator's thumb (resulting in [...] "M1 thumb"); the hand is then quickly withdrawn, the operating rod moves forward and the bolt closes with sufficient force to go fully to battery. Thus, after the clip has been pressed into position in the magazine, the <b>operating</b> rod <b>handle</b> should be released, allowing the bolt to snap forward under pressure from the operating rod spring. The <b>operating</b> rod <b>handle</b> may be smacked with the palm to ensure the bolt is closed.|$|R
