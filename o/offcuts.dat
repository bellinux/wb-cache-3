25|$|The {{excavations}} of 1978 found medieval {{leather shoes}} and numerous leather <b>offcuts,</b> suggesting a tannery was {{located on the}} site during this period. A D-shaped oak timber was found which might have formed part of a tanning bench, as well as wooden bowls and platters and medieval pottery. Large amounts of burnt charcoal, coal and clay dating from the early post-Medieval period were uncovered; they are believed to represent an 11–12th century salt working on the site.|$|E

The new vehicles included [...] "E-leather" [...] upholstery (a type of manmade composition leather made from recycled waste leather <b>offcuts),</b> power sockets, CCTV which enables passengers on the top deck to watch their luggage on the lower deck, LED lights and free wi-fi. The vehicles cost over £200,000 each, £30,000 more than standard vehicles, and carry a two-tone blue and red livery. The previous Scanias carried a livery of white and light/dark blue, with orange detailing.|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{germanium}} (Ge) epitaxial films grown directly on silicon (Si) (001) with 0 ° and 6 ° <b>offcut</b> orientation using a reduced-pressure {{chemical vapor deposition}} system is studied and compared. Ge film grown on Si (001) with 6 ° <b>offcut</b> presents ∼ 65 % higher threading dislocation density and higher root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness (1. 92 nm versus 0. 98 nm) than Ge film grown on Si (001) with 0 ° <b>offcut.</b> Plan-view transmission electron microscopy also reveals that threading dislocations are more severe (in terms of contrast and density) for the 6 ° <b>offcut.</b> In addition, both high-resolution x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy analyses show that the Ge epilayer on 6 ° <b>offcut</b> wafer presents higher tensile strain. The poorer quality of the Ge film on Si (001) with 6 ° <b>offcut</b> {{is a result of}} an imbalance in Burgers vectors that favors dislocation nucleation over annihilation. Singapore.

A single cowhide <b>offcut</b> is suggestive of the presence of a leatherworker in the settlement, but the remaining fragments of goatskin are uninformative. Since vegetable tanning does not appear in northern Europe till after the 8 th century, the survival of leather in wells dating to the early 5 th and the 7 th century poses a problem: a form of natural tannage may be considered, {{but in the case of}} the <b>offcut</b> from a well constructed after c.

40|$|The {{surface of}} cubic silicon carbide (3 C-SiC) hetero-epitaxial films grown on the (111) surface of silicon is a {{promising}} template for the subsequent epitaxial growth of III-V semiconductor layers and graphene. We investigate growth and post-growth approaches for controlling the surface roughness of epitaxial SiC {{to produce an}} optimal template. We first explore 3 C-SiC growth on various degrees of <b>offcut</b> Si(111) substrates, although we observe that the SiC roughness tends to worsen as the degree of <b>offcut</b> increases. Hence we focus on post-growth approaches available on full wafers, comparing chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) and a novel plasma smoothening process. The CMP leads to a dramatic improvement, bringing the SiC surface roughness down to sub-nanometer level, though removing about 200 ?nm of the SiC layer. On the other hand, our proposed HCl plasma process appears very effective in smoothening selectively the sharpest surface topography, leading up to 30 % improvement in SiC roughness with only about 50 ?nm thickness loss. We propose a simple physical model explaining {{the action of the}} plasma smoothening. Griffith Sciences, School of Natural SciencesFull Tex...|$|R
