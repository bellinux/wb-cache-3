5|$|Following {{the success}} <b>of</b> <b>A</b> <b>Moment</b> with You, Wong Fu was {{approached}} {{to create a}} second film called Sleep Shift. However, the project was abandoned after producers disagreed with casting an Asian male in the film's lead role. Since {{the end of its}} first tour, Wong Fu has created music videos for rising artists and continued producing short films. The group's merchandise line, which included original T-shirt designs, was launched in conjunction with the 2007 film Just a Nice Guy. The short film The Spare was featured at the 2008 San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival, and two additional short films—At Musing's End and A Peace of Home—were shown at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival Short Films Corner. In September 2009, Wong Fu released the short film Poser!, a mockumentary {{on the history of the}} peace sign.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween, Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is carving a jack-o'-lantern while {{preparing}} {{to take his}} daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) trick-or-treating. As he leaves to collect her, he notices a demonic figure watching him from across the street. That night, Jordan deliberately passes by one house, telling Black that it is haunted. Black tells her {{there are no such}} thing as ghosts, but is reminded <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> from his past. In a flashback, we see a five-year-old Black being dared by his friends to knock the door of the same house; a man named Crocell (Dean Winters) answers and invites Black inside. Crocell is a Second World War veteran, and he explains the meaning of Halloween to Black, telling the boy that it is the one night of the year that ghosts walk among the living. Crocell hopes that it is his chance to commune with the friends he lost in the war, and is dismayed when the young Black dismisses the possibility of ghosts.|$|E

The magnitude of the two forces is equal and opposite, according to the third law of Newton, and the activation can be measured by a dynamometer.|$|E

500|$|Lichtenstein's method entailed [...] "strengthening of {{the formal}} aspects of the composition, a stylization of motif, and a 'freezing' of both emotion and actions". Although comic-book panels depict a moment in time, Drowning Girl is {{borrowed}} from {{an example of a}} comic-book panel depiction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> relatively more [...] "pregnant" [...] with past- and future-dependent drama than most moments. This work also marks a phase in Lichtenstein's career when many of his works were given present-participial titles such as Sleeping Girl, Crying Girl and Blonde Waiting, which accentuates the works' [...] "relation to process and action." [...] According to The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, during this phase of Lichtenstein's career [...] "a constant if restrained and a gentle sense of humor contribute just as much to the cheerful lightness of Lichtenstein's work as the balanced, completely harmonious composition." ...|$|E

Epistle 48 tells how the friends return to Stockholm by boat after a night out on Lake Mälaren, one summer morning in 1769. Each of its twenty-one verses paints a picture <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in the peaceful journey, from the wind stirring the fallen sails, the skipper's daughter coming out of her cabin, the cockerel crowing, the church clock striking four in the morning, the sun glimmering on the calm water. The effects may seem to be haphazard, but [...] "each stanza is a little picture, framed by its melody. We remember it all, seem to have lived through it, like a morning in our own lives." [...] Britten Austin calls it [...] "a new vision of the natural and urban scene. Fresh as Martin's. Detailed as Hogarth's. Frail and ethereal as Watteau's." ...|$|E

The poster for [...] "The Only Light in The Darkness", created by Pascal Campion, focuses on Coulson and his cellist lover, Audrey, while also hinting at the villain for the episode, Marcus Daniels. The poster for [...] "Nothing Personal", created by Stephanie Hans, [...] highlights Skye and Ward in a depiction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> from the episode, with Deathlok looming over them, and the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo in the background.

The poster for [...] "Beginning of the End", created by Phantom City Creative, is reminiscent of the first official poster released, with differences including the characters' order and clothing, the poster's coloring, a broken S.H.I.E.L.D. logo over Hydra's, and Ward being tinted by Hydra.|$|E
500|$|In 1965, the {{influence}} of artists such as Bob Dylan, who moved beyond political protest by experimenting with abstract and surreal lyrical imagery, then switched to electric guitar, became increasingly pervasive across the musical landscape, affecting a number of genres, including garage rock. [...] The members of garage bands, like so many musicians of the 1960s, {{were part of a}} generation that was largely born into the paradigm and customs of an older time, but grew up confronting a new set of issues facing a more advanced and technological age. [...] Postwar prosperity brought the advantages of better education, was well as more spare time for recreation, which along with the new technology, made it possible for an increasing number of young people to play music. [...] With the advent of television, nuclear weapons, civil rights, the Cold War, and space exploration, the new generation was more global in its mindset and began to conceive of a higher order of human relations, attempting to reach for a set of transcendent ideals, often expressed through rock music. [...] Though set to a backdrop of tragic events that ultimately proved disillusioning, the various forms of personal and musical experimentation held promise, at least for a time, in the minds of many. [...] While testing the frontiers of what the new world had to offer, 1960s youth ultimately had to accept the limitations of the new reality, yet often did so while experiencing the ecstasy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> when the range of possibilities seemed boundless and within reach.|$|E

The third procedure also is nonpara-metric but it tests the specication <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conditional <b>moment</b> restriction model against all alternative specications.

Atiyah and Bott [...] showed {{that this could be}} deduced from a more general formula in equivariant cohomology, which was a consequence of well-known localization theorems. Atiyah showed that the moment map was closely related to geometric invariant theory, and this idea was later developed much further by his student F. Kirwan. Witten shortly after applied the Duistermaat–Heckman formula to loop spaces and showed that this formally gave the Atiyah–Singer index theorem for the Dirac operator; this idea was lectured on by Atiyah.|$|E

2500|$|The anatta {{doctrine}} {{is not a}} kind of materialism. Buddhism does not deny the existence of [...] "immaterial" [...] entities, and it (at least traditionally) distinguishes bodily states from mental states. Thus, the conventional translation of anatta as [...] "no-soul" [...] can be confusing. If the word [...] "soul" [...] simply refers to an incorporeal component in living things that can continue after death, then Buddhism does not deny {{the existence of the}} soul. Instead, Buddhism denies the existence of a permanent entity that remains constant behind the changing corporeal and incorporeal components of a living being. Just as the body changes from moment to moment, so thoughts come and go, and there is no permanent state underlying the mind that experiences these thoughts, as in Cartesianism. Conscious mental states simply arise and perish with no [...] "thinker" [...] behind them. When the body dies, Buddhists believe the incorporeal mental processes continue and are reborn in a new body. Because the mental processes are constantly changing, the being that is reborn is neither entirely different from, nor exactly the same as, the being that died. However, the new being is continuous with the being that died – {{in the same way that}} the [...] "you" [...] of this moment is continuous with the [...] "you" [...] <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> before, despite the fact that you are constantly changing.|$|E

30|$|When {{working on}} a problem, humans can have <b>an</b> “eureka” <b>moment</b> when they glimpse the problem solution.

Continuous education loads more facts into participants’ minds and may increase the chance <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eureka <b>moment.</b> Technology can also increase the chance <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eureka <b>moment</b> by explicitly managing the juxtaposition of facts presented to the solvers. More eyes on a problem increases the chances of uncovering key insights, especially if technology presents the problems in new contexts.
