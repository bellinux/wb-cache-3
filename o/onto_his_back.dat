5|$|During Barry's career, he was {{credited}} with saving the lives of more than forty people, although this number has sometimes varied over the years. Barry's most famous rescue {{was that of a}} young boy. He found the child asleep in a cavern of ice. After warming up the boy's body sufficiently by licking him, he moved the boy about and <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> and carried the child back to the hospice. The child survived and was returned to his parents, although other sources say that the boy's mother died in the avalanche that trapped the boy. The Museum of Natural History in Bern disputes the legend, attributing it to Peter Scheitlin, an animal psychologist.|$|E
5|$|A defense-appointed {{expert witness}} {{in the field of}} {{biomechanics}} testified on March 5 that Nosek could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward, he could not have sustained an injury {{to the back of his}} head. He further said that if Nosek fell over the first row of the fans, he must have been not only pushed, but must have jumped himself. The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony, claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time, as well as some of the eyewitness testimonies, according to which Nosek fell <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> from the beginning and did not turn during the fall. The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points.|$|E
5|$|England {{started their}} second innings 337 runs in arrears. Dewes took strike and {{got off the}} mark from Lindwall when he aimed a hook shot and was {{credited}} with a boundary when the ball came off his shoulder. Lindwall's steepling bouncer rose over his bat and narrowly missed his head. Soon after, Lindwall made the early breakthrough, bowling Dewes—who offered no shot—for 10 to leave England 20/1. Dewes had often committed to playing the ball from the front foot before the bowler delivered the ball, thereby putting himself into difficulty. This was because of his habit of leaning his weight <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> foot as the ball was being bowled, which meant that a forward lean would instinctively result. Edrich joined Hutton and the pair consolidated the England innings, which reached 54/1 at the close at the second day's play, which was hastened by bad light.|$|E
60|$|With {{the pain}} he snapped his mouth closed. I fell upon his snout, lost my hold upon the spear, rolled {{the length of}} his face and head, across <b>his</b> short neck <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> broad <b>back</b> and from there to the ground.|$|R
50|$|Tomoe nage is {{performed}} by the attacker (tori) gripping the opponent (uke) high and falling backward as in a backward roll. Once uke is off balance forward, tori plants a foot low on uke at waist level and applies strong pressure, rolling <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> own <b>back</b> with uke above him. This causes uke to flip over tori and land on <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> The final position is both practitioners are on their backs, head to head. Variations that maintain the high grip and complete the backward roll allow tori to mount uke {{at the completion of}} the throw. Counters to tomoe nage include crouching or evading the rising foot of the attacker.|$|R
50|$|One night, while Jane {{is walking}} {{to a nearby}} town, a {{horseman}} passes her. The horse slips on ice and throws the rider. Despite the rider's surliness, Jane helps him to get <b>back</b> <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> horse. Later, <b>back</b> at Thornfield, she learns that this man is Edward Rochester, master of the house. Adèle is his ward, left in his care when her mother abandoned her.|$|R

25|$|The quirky {{music video}} {{for the song}} and several others from this album {{received}} significant airplay on the upstart MTV. A notable feature of the video was dancer Craig Allen Rothwell, known as Spazz Attack, whose signature dance move, a forward flip <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> drew him significant attention.|$|E
25|$|The seventh {{match was}} a tag team match between {{the team of}} Jay Youngblood and Ricky Steamboat, and the team of Jack and Jerry Brisco for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. Angelo Mosca was the special guest referee. The match started back and forth until Jack {{performed}} a double underhook suplex to Steamboat, slamming him <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> The Briscos had the advantage until Jerry complained to and shoved Mosca after almost pinning Youngblood. Mosca shoved Jerry down, and Youngblood and Steamboat gained the advantage. They performed an aided splash, where Steamboat dropped Youngblood onto the fallen Jerry, and Youngblood pinned him to win the match and the title. After the match, the Briscos attacked Youngblood, Steamboat and Mosca until they fought back.|$|E
50|$|This {{variation}} of a vertical suplex, {{also known as}} the Crash Landing, sees the attacker lift his opponent up with the standard suplex lift but instead of falling backwards and having the opponent drop down <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> shoulders and <b>back,</b> the attacker turns the opponent and releases them from the front facelock at the apex of the lift. Both the attacker and the opponent fall forward, with the opponent landing on his neck, shoulders and back.|$|R
50|$|He kept very {{detailed}} {{notes in his}} journal and {{was the one to}} issue the tattouage of the instructions <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> own <b>back</b> so that future incarnations could more easily find out who they were. He was the one to trick Pharod into searching for the Bronze Sphere for himself, and imprisoned Vhailor in a cell, so that, in years to come, he could release Vhailor and exploit his abilities. He commissioned a dream machine from Xeno Xander and a portal to reach Ravel from the Godsmen, but was never able to make use of them. He attempted to thwart his hidden enemy, of whom he was forever suspicious. He tried creating false bodies, hiding on the Outer Planes, and building a tomb to trap him in, which he admits to have been disastrous.|$|R
50|$|A handstand {{variation}} {{can also}} be used. With the opponent seated on the top turnbuckle facing the ring, the wrestler performs a handstand on the bottom turnbuckle, wrapping his or her shins or feet {{around the neck of}} the opponent. The wrestler then bends his or her legs forward towards the ring, pulling the opponent over and flipping him or her down to the mat <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>back.</b> Former WWE wrestler Trish Stratus used this variation of the move as one of her signatures, calling it the Stratusphere.|$|R
25|$|Males can be choosier than females. As an offering, {{males are}} capable of {{providing}} nuptial gifts secretions, which can be more expensive than female reproductive investment, parental care, where the reproductive costs in males are higher than in females because they invest large quantities of resources and time after egg fertilization, and foraging and nesting sites to the females. Moreover, these factors decrease their subsequent male reproductive opportunities, {{and the availability of}} males. An example of male parental care can be found in belostomatid water bugs, where the male, after fertilizing the eggs, allows the female to glue her eggs <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> He broods them until the nymphs hatch 2–4 weeks later. The eggs are large and reduce the ability of the male to fertilize other females and catch prey, and increases its predation risk.|$|E
25|$|The War of Independence {{broke out}} in the state of Guanajuato in the town of Dolores, when Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla shouted the “Grito de Dolores” and raised an insurgent army on 15 and 16 September 1810. This army marched to San Miguel, today San Miguel de Allende, and then onto the city of Guanajuato. Just on the {{outskirts}} on 28 September 1810, Hidalgo sent a warning letter to city authorities, but it was ignored. Instead, royalist troops and many of the elite made their stand at the Alhóndiga de Granaditas granary, an imposing building with few windows and thick walls. After entering the city unopposed, Hidalgo decided to attack the granary. This was the first battle against Spanish troops in the war and is popularly called the 'Siege of the Alhondiga'. The insurgents were unable to take the heavily defended building as royalist gunfire kept them from approaching the only entrance until a miner by the name of Juan José de los Reyes Martínez, better known as El Pípila, brilliantly strapped a large flat stone <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> for protection. Crawling, he carried a flask of tar and a torch. When he reached the wooden doors of the main entrance, he smeared it with the tar and set it on fire. This allowed the insurgents to penetrate the building, defeat the Spanish royalist army and elite, and take over the heavily fortified and defended building. This action is commemorated by a colossal statue of Pipila on a hill overlooking the city.|$|E

5000|$|... "Description of a Struggle" [...] {{is one of}} Kafka's longer {{minor works}} and {{is divided into three}} chapters. The first chapter is narrated by a young man {{attending}} a party and tells of his [...] "acquaintance" [...] (as he is referred to in the story) that he meets there. The second chapter is the longest and is itself split into several sections. The narrator leaps <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> acquaintance's <b>back</b> and rides him like a horse and imagines a landscape that responds to his every whim. He then meets an extraordinarily fat man carried on a litter who tells him the story of a [...] "supplicant" [...] who prays by smashing his head into the ground. In the third chapter, the narrator returns to reality, so to speak, and continues his walk up the Laurenziberg in winter with his acquaintance.|$|R
50|$|The bards {{report that}} Dadror was {{poisoned}} by his head priest, (Dewaji), in 620 AD {{and he was}} followed by five Brahmin kings before the capture of Rori or Al Ror by the Arabs. On the other hand, written records like the Chachnama report that the Brahmin usurper was Chach and not Dewaji. Considering that the bards may {{have made a mistake}} in their orally transmitted reports from generation to generation, we can place a greater faith on the date of 620 AD and that corresponds well with Chach, the usurper's lifetime. That would mean that the dynasty reported as the Rai Dynasty was a continuation of the founding Ror dynasty of Rori and Rai Sahasi II was not killed by Chach jumping <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> horse's <b>back</b> in an open field (as in Chachnama) but in cold blood by mixing poison in his food.|$|R
5000|$|In The Mask of Zorro, when Diego {{returns to}} his home after being imprisoned for twenty years he finds that everything, {{including}} the original Tornado is gone. (The novelization states that Tornado probably stayed {{in the area for}} as long as possible for love of his master before wandering away.) His successor, Alejandro Murrieta, finds himself his own horse which he names Tornado after the first horse. (The novelization suggests that it may be the son of the earlier Tornado.) It is an intelligent animal, but was at first poorly disciplined and seemed to deliberately make life difficult for his would-be master. For example, when Zorro prepared to jump from a building <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> horse's <b>back,</b> Tornado walked a few steps forward so his master fell on the streets when he jumped. In this film's sequel, The Legend of Zorro, Tornado changes from obeying to disobeying Alejandro at various times, explained in the film as the horse's inability to correctly interpret English commands.|$|R
500|$|The 1986 Ski Flying World Championships in Kulm {{highlighted}} {{the dangers of}} the sport in a most graphic way. In the second competition of the event, Andreas Felder equalled the world record to win the gold medal, ahead of Nykänen who won bronze. However, this was overshadowed by a series of horrific accidents which took place earlier. In treacherous crosswind conditions, Masahiro Akimoto lost control moments after takeoff, falling suddenly from a height of [...] <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> He suffered a fractured ankle in addition to chest and shoulder injuries. A few minutes later Rolf Åge Berg frighteningly lost control at the same height, at an estimated inrun speed of , but was able to land safely on both skis.|$|E
500|$|On 24 July 1940, almost 40 Bf 109s of III./JG 26 {{took off}} for {{operations}} over the English Channel—a phase of the battle known as the Kanalkampf. They were met by 12 54 Squadron Spitfires. The Spitfires forced the larger number of Bf 109s into a turning battle that ran down the Germans' fuel. Galland recalled being impressed by the Spitfire's ability to outmanoeuvre Bf 109s at low speed and to turn into the Bf 109s within little airspace. Only by executing a [...] "Split S" [...] (a half-roll <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> followed by pulling into a long, curving dive) that the Spitfire could not follow without exceeding its maximum safe speed and risking structural failure, could his aircraft escape back to France at low altitude. The II./Jagdgeschwader 52 covered their retreat, losing two Bf 109s to Spitfires from No. 610 Squadron. During the action, two Spitfires were shot down {{for the loss of}} four Bf 109s. Galland was shocked by the aggression shown by pilots he believed to be relatively inexperienced. Galland later said he realised there would be no quick and easy victory.|$|E

5000|$|Throughout {{the ages}} and in {{practically}} all countries {{there have been}} proverbial associations of given regions with foolishness or insanity, ranging from the Phrygians and Boeotians of classical times, down to the present. [...] Stories of the Wise Men of Gotham are prominent medieval examples. Apocryphally, the men of Gotham feigned insanity to discourage unwelcome attention from the representatives of King John early in the thirteenth century. Their fictitious activities recalled stories from many other alleged regions of dunces and in fact, many recurring stories have been borrowed through the ages from other times and places, either for entertainment or satire. For example, some Gotham stories, variously embellished, are far older than the actual town of Gotham; consider for instance the second one: it concerned the man who, not wishing to overburden his horse, took the load off <b>his</b> horse <b>onto</b> <b>his</b> own <b>back</b> as he rode it. That story dates back much further than medieval times and {{since the time of}} the alleged event in Gotham, it has appeared in Afrikaans comics of the mid-twentieth century, and no doubt elsewhere. However, such traditions often grow on histories of tyranny and are nurtured as two-edged weapons; as the men of Gotham reputedly said: [...] "We ween there are more fools pass through Gotham than remain in it." ...|$|R

2500|$|Comparisons {{of the two}} Pudsey masters {{have been}} {{inevitable}} but there were essential differences in style. Bill Bowes said that Sutcliffe readily acknowledged the superior ability of Jack Hobbs, Wally Hammond and Len Hutton but what Sutcliffe did have were the concentration and willpower {{to make the best}} of his abilities in any given situation.

Hence Sutcliffe more easily moved back while Hutton developed a forward style.
