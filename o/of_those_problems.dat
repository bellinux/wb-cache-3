5|$|Environmental {{sociology}} is {{the study}} of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>problems,</b> and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, rural sociology and the sociology of disaster.|$|E

They asked the state Republican Party to consider postponing the vote because <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>problems</b> and others, such as unclear rules on who could vote.|$|E

25|$|The {{first flight}} of the N-9M {{occurred}} on 27 December 1942 with Northrop test pilot John Myers at the controls. During the next five months, 45 flights were made. Nearly all were terminated by mechanical failures {{of one sort or}} another, the Menasco engines being the primary source <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>problems.</b> After roughly 22.5 hours of accumulated flight time, the first N-9M crashed approximately 12miles (19km) west of Muroc Army Air Base on 19 May 1943. The pilot, Max Constant, was killed as he attempted to recover the aircraft from a right-hand, 60° nose-down spin. The investigation found that Constant had suffered control reversal, the control column had been pressed against his chest during his recovery attempt from the steep spin, preventing him from parachuting to safety. Steps were taken to fix this problem and prevent it from happening on other N-9M test aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{cutting fluids}} {{are used in}} aerosol (mist) form (air with tiny {{droplets}} of liquid scattered throughout). The main problems with mists have been that they are rather bad for the workers, who have to breathe the surrounding mist-tainted air, and that they sometimes don't even work very well. Both <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>problems</b> come from the imprecise delivery that often puts the mist everywhere {{and all the time}} except at the cutting interface, during the cut—the one place and time where it's wanted. However, a newer form of aerosol delivery, [...] (minimum quantity of lubricant), avoids both <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>problems.</b> The delivery of the aerosol is directly through the flutes of the tool (it arrives directly through or around the insert itself—an ideal type of cutting fluid delivery that traditionally has been unavailable outside of a few contexts such as gun drilling or expensive, state-of-the-art liquid delivery in production milling). MQL's aerosol is delivered in such a precisely targeted way (with respect to both location and timing) that the net effect seems almost like dry machining from the operators' perspective. The chips generally seem like dry-machined chips, requiring no draining, and the air is so clean that machining cells can be stationed closer to inspection and assembly than before. MQL doesn't provide much cooling in the sense of heat transfer, but its well-targeted lubricating action prevents some of the heat from being generated in the first place, which helps to explain its success.|$|E

This {{research paper}} also describes the problem faced by {{the teacher and the}} students in teaching and studying English. The researcher does three ways to collect the data, namely: observation, interview, and document. The data are field notes that are taken from teaching-learning process, note of interview with the teacher about the techniques used and document to support teaching English. In collecting the data, the writer focuses on the sixth year of SDN 4 Juworo. The result of the observation shows that, (1) there are two techniques used in teaching English to the sixth year of SDN 4 Juworo namely: picture observation and jumbled words. Both <b>of</b> <b>those</b> techniques are applied to make the students interested in learning English, (2) there are many problems faced by the teacher in teaching English namely: limited vocabulary, pronunciation, and motivation. The <b>problem</b> solving <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>problem</b> are: in limited vocabulary, the teacher gives a list of difficult words related to the topic. In pronunciation, the teacher gives example how to read the words in English correctly and the students repeat and memorize it. In motivation, the teacher should gives motivate the students in order that they are confidence to express their idea. Beside the problems faced by the teacher, (3) there are many problems faced by the students in studying English namely: student’s interest and material. The <b>problems</b> solving <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>problem</b> are: the students must have an intention to know about foreign language and teacher should give material according to their ability and their level. ...|$|R

[...] Most importantly, he said, [...] "FCVs aren't green" [...] because of escaping methane during natural gas extraction and when hydrogen is produced, as 95% of it is, using the steam reforming process. He concluded that renewable energy cannot economically be used to make hydrogen for an FCV fleet [...] "either now or in the future." [...] Greentech Media's analyst reached similar conclusions in 2014. In 2015, Clean Technica listed some of the disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. So did Car Throttle. Another Clean Technica writer concluded, [...] "while hydrogen may have a part to play in the world of energy storage (especially seasonal storage), it looks like a dead end when it comes to mainstream vehicles." ...|$|E

Supporters of Peter claim that his driving off the tee entitles him to an unchallenged pre-eminence among the world's most hopeless foozlers--only to be discomfited later when the advocates of James show, by means of diagrams, that no one has ever surpassed their man in absolute incompetence with the spoon.

6000|$|Concluding Remarks on [...] "Lemuria."--I {{have gone}} into this {{question}} in some detail, because Dr. Hartlaub's criticism on my views has been reproduced in a scientific periodical,[101] and the supposed Lemurian continent is constantly referred to by quasi-scientific writers, {{as well as by}} naturalists and geologists, as if its existence had been demonstrated by facts, or as if it were absolutely necessary to postulate such a land in order to account for the entire series of phenomena connected with the Madagascar fauna, and especially with the distribution of the Lemuridæ.[102] I {427} think I have now shown, on the other hand, that it was essentially a provisional hypothesis, very useful in calling attention to a remarkable series of problems in geographical distribution, but not affording the true solution <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>problems,</b> any more than the hypothesis of an Atlantis solved the problems presented by the Atlantic Islands and the relations of the European and North American flora and fauna. The Atlantis is now rarely introduced seriously except by the absolutely unscientific, having received its death-blow by the chapter on Oceanic Islands in the Origin of Species, and the researches of Professor Asa Gray on the affinities of the North American and Asiatic floras. But [...] "Lemuria" [...] still keeps its place--a good example of the survival of a provisional hypothesis which offers what seems an easy solution of a difficult problem, and has received an appropriate and easily remembered name, long after it has been proved to be untenable.|$|E

This approach will be based on the development of a Hierarchical System of Linguistic Rules learning methodology. This methodology has been thought as a refinement of simple linguistic models which, preserving their descriptive power, introduces small changes to increase their accuracy. To do so, we extend the structure of the Knowledge Base of Fuzzy Rule Base Systems in a hierarchical way, {{in order to make it}} more flexible. This flexibilization will allow us to have linguistic rules defined over linguistic partitions with different granularity levels, and thus to improve the modeling <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>problem</b> subspaces where the former models have bad performance.
