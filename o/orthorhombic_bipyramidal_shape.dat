40|$|A well-crystallized AMO(4) (A=Ba, Ca, Sr; M=W, Mo) {{films have}} been {{prepared}} at room temperature through a simple solution reaction in respective alkaline solution at higher pH ranging from 12 - 14. Adopting the corrosion principle for oxidation of metal substrate, these double oxide films were carried out in presence of chemical driving force without any special apparatus or devices. Hydrogen peroxide was used to enhance the dissolution rate of metal substrates. The driving force for the film formation and growth were high concentration of A(2 +), MO 42 - ions with high pH conditions. Average grain sizes of 8 - 10 mu m with <b>bipyramidal</b> <b>shaped</b> particle were grown to the thickness of about 10 - 14 mu m after 3 - 6 hours treatment.

40|$|Nanoparticulate {{surfaces}} possessing antimicrobial and fungicidal properties under {{visible light}} illumination have found wide applications {{in a number}} of fields. In this study, titania nanotubes, as well as titania compact films were designed with pure Cu 2 O crystals in a mildly acidic copper acetate solution using a simple alternating current (AC) deposition approach. In this way, the thermally oxidized Ti substrate was coated by densely packed pyramidal and <b>bipyramidal</b> <b>shaped</b> Cu 2 O crystals with dominant (111) planes and investigated against several types of fungi and bacteria. For comparison, TiO 2 nanotube (TiNT) films were also decorated with similar crystals and tested. The results showed that, compared to bare TiO 2 films, both Cu 2 O-in- TiNT and Cu 2 O-on-TiO 2 heterostructures exhibited remarkably enhanced activity against tested fungi and bacteria. We also demonstrated that the high photoactivity of these crystals remained even after 50 h stability tests under bright light illumination. The results obtained from in vitro tests indicated that Cu 2 O-in/on-TiO 2 heterostructures show promise as visible light driven antimicrobial materials...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{great number}} of studies focus their {{interest}} on the photophysical properties of fluorescent hybrid gold nanoparticles for potential applications in biotechnologies such as imaging and/or treatment. Spherical gold nanoparticles are known to quench a chromophore fluorescent signal, when moieties are located in their close vicinity. The use of a polymer spacer on such a system allowed only partial recovery of the dye emission by controlling the surface to dye distance. Gold-based anisotropic sharp nanostructures appear to exhibit more interesting features due to the strong electric field generated at their edges and tips. In this paper, a complete study of hybrid fluorescent bipyramidal-like gold nanostructures is presented. We describe the chemical synthesis of gold bipyramids functionalized with fluorescent water-soluble polymers and their photophysics both in solution and on a single object. We show {{that the use of}} a <b>bipyramidal</b> <b>shape</b> instead of a spherical one leads to total recovery of the fluorescence and even to an enhancement of the emission of the dyes by a factor of 1. 4...|$|R
40|$|Antifreeze {{proteins}} (AFPs) {{provide protection}} for organisms {{subjected to the}} presence of ice crystals. The psychrophilic diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus which is frequently found in polar sea ice carries a multitude of AFP isoforms. In this study we report the heterologous expression of two antifreeze protein isoforms from F. cylindrus in Escherichia coli. Refolding from inclusion bodies produced proteins functionally active with respect to crystal deformation, recrystallization inhibition and thermal hysteresis. We observed a reduction of activity {{in the presence of the}} pelB leader peptide in comparison with the GS-linked SUMO-tag. Activity was positively correlated to protein concentration and buffer salinity. Thermal hysteresis and crystal deformation habit suggest the affiliation of the proteins to the hyperactive group of AFPs. One isoform, carrying a signal peptide for secretion, produced a thermal hysteresis up to 1. 53 °C ± 0. 53 °C and ice crystals of hexagonal <b>bipyramidal</b> <b>shape.</b> The second isoform, which has a long preceding N-terminal sequence of unknown function, produced thermal hysteresis of up to 2. 34 °C ± 0. 25 °C. Ice crystals grew in form of a hexagonal column in presence of this protein. The different sequences preceding the ice binding domain point to distinct localizations of the proteins inside or outside the cell. We thus propose that AFPs have different functions in vivo, also reflected in their specific TH capability...|$|R

The Pt 75 Re 25 nanoparticles (containing from 586 to 4033 atoms) are assumed to have disordered fcc configurations and cubo-octahedral shapes (terminated by {l_brace} 111 {r_brace} and {l_brace} 100 {r_brace} facets), while the Pt 50 Re 50 and Pt 25 Re 75 nanoparticles (containing from 587 to 4061 atoms) are assumed to have disordered hcp configurations and truncated hexagonal <b>bipyramidal</b> <b>shapes</b> (terminated by {l_brace} 0001 {r_brace} and {l_brace} 101 {bar 1 }{r_brace} facets). We predict that due to the segregation process the equilibrium Pt-Re nanoparticles would achieve a core-shell structure, with a Pt-enriched shell surrounding a Pt-deficient core. For fcc cubo-octahedral Pt 75 Re 25 nanoparticles, the shells consist of almost 100 at. percent of Pt atoms. Even in the shells of hcp truncated hexagonal bipyramidal Pt 50 Re 50 nanoparticles, the concentrations of Pt atoms exceed 85 at. percent (35 at. {{percent higher than the}} overall concentration of Pt atoms in these nanoparticles). Most prominently, all Pt atoms will segregate to the surfaces in the hcp truncated hexagonal bipyramidal Pt 25 Re 75 nanoparticles containing less than 1000 atoms. We also find that the Pt atoms segregate preferentially to the vertex sites, less to edge sites, and least to facet sites on the shell of Pt-Re nanoparticles...|$|R
40|$|We {{collected}} 3, 237 plant samples, mainly {{leaves of}} various trees, from many provinces in Korea {{and a total}} of 1, 925 Bacillus thuringiensis isolates were obtained and characterized. The isolates were characterized in terms of crystal morphology, PAGE pattern of the toxin proteins, plasmids pattern, biochemical characteristics, and bioassay. The microscopic observation showed that 49. 1 % of the isolates have <b>bipyramidal</b> <b>shape</b> crystals, 7. 1 % of spherical shape crystals, 1. 4 % of rhomboidal shape crystals, and others have small or amorphous inclusions. The insecticidal activities of the spore-crystal mixtures of isolates were tested against Plutella xylostella, Bombyx mori, Culex pipiens, and Agelastica coerulea. Bioassay showed that 51. 3 % of the isolates were shown to be activelepidopteran-specific (44. 8 %), dipteran-specific(4. 9 %) and coleopteran-specific (1. 6 %). The remainder(48. 8 %) did not show any activity against the insects we tested. Interestingly though, some of these non-active isolates were shown to have bipyramidal crystals. By serotyping 22 isolates of our collection, we found that there are various kind of subspecies such as aizawai, amagiens, canadensis, darmstadiensis, galleriae, finitimus, kurstaki, morrisoni and neoleonensis, and three isolates have been classified into a new serotype, H 49, and one of them, the type strain, named subsp. muju.

40|$|Tunneling of an {{electron}} from the electrode towards {{the island in}} single electron transistor (SET) is a quantum mechanical phenomenon. This means, that electron can either tunnels to the island or not depending on the probability. Therefore, the study on how the electron interacts with a quantum dot should give the needed information in advancing the development of SET. With several assumptions, the electron trajectory from the electrode towards the island is studied in this research using classical approaches. The island is first developed by optimizing gallium arsenide (GaAs) cluster using the parallel version of GAMESS package. With {{the information from the}} optimized cluster, GaAs quantum dot is built as an island for the SET. The dot has a square <b>bipyramidal</b> <b>shape</b> with total 84 atoms in 1. 6 nm 3 volume. Then the external electric field is applied towards the dot to study the potential distribution {{in the vicinity of the}} dot. Using this potential distribution, the electron trajectory is mapped and plotted using MacMolPlt and GnuPlot programs. The plotted result shows how the electron moves towards the dot and sticks in a loop. It is found that the loop is caused by the attraction of atomic nucleus of one of the atom in the dot. As the conclusion, the electron trajectory is discovered and plotted from the source electrode to the island. On the other hand, the electron does not pass through the island to the drain because of nuclear attraction which can be improved in future simulation...|$|R
40|$|Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) {{nanoparticles}} {{are extremely}} attractive materials for numerous applications, {{especially in the}} anatase form. We have made these shaped, < 10 nm anatase nanoparticles (NPs) via the super-critical (SC) drying of a titania sol, made by a g̈reenäqueous sol-gel nanosynthesis route. The SC drying {{was carried out in}} alcohol at 255 - 260 degrees C, and no further heating or processing of the NPs was required. The true phase composition (crystalline and amorphous phases) and the microstructure of the NPs was thoroughly characterised by the advanced X-ray methods, such as Rietveld-reference intensity ratio (RIR) and the whole powder pattern modelling (WPPM) technique, and HR-TEM analysis. Furthermore, the NPs were also characterised by Raman, FT-IR and optical spectroscopy. These anatase NPs showed themselves to exhibit a truncated tetragonal <b>bipyramidal</b> <b>shape,</b> exposing the 101 (side) and 001 (top) faces. They had a euhedral crystal habit, with sharply defined and easily recognised faces, and were very homogeneous and monodisperse in both shape and size. The photocatalytic activity (PCA) of the samples was assessed in gas-solid phase by monitoring the degradation of nitrogen oxides (NOx), a major atmospheric pollutant. Results showed that the particular shape of these anatase NPs {{played a key role in}} their photocatalytic behaviour. In fact, these truncated tetragonal bipyramidal nanocrystals exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic activity, double that of spherical anatase NPs of a similar size reported previously by the authors. This was attributed to the exposure of mainly the 101 and, to a lesser extent, 001 crystal faces, which are more reactive under photocatalysis for redox reactions...|$|R

40|$|Biocompatible anatase TiO 2 single-crystals with 27 % [...] 50 % {{chemically}} reactive facets {{were obtained}} in 90 minutes {{by using a}} microwave-assisted method. The preparation involved an aqueous solution of titanium tetrafluoride and an ionic liquid (1 -methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate). The as-obtained TiO 2 single-crystals exhibited a truncated tetragonal <b>bipyramidal</b> <b>shape.</b> By simply changing the concentration of the ionic liquid, the level of reactive facets can be continuously tuned from 27 % to 50 %. The use of microwave heating is critical as it allows rapid and uniform heating of the reaction mixture. The TiO 2 single-crystals were characterized by XRD, TEM, XPS and FESEM. The products exhibited excellent photocatalytic efficiency for both oxidation of nitric oxide in air and degradation of organic compounds in aqueous solution under UV light irradiation. The relationship between the physicochemical properties and the photocatalytic performance of the samples was discussed. The TiO 2 single-crystals {{were found to be}} nontoxic using Zebrafish (D. rerio) as a model. Bismuth oxyhalide semiconductors (BiOBr, BiOCl) with marigold-like open architectures were also prepared by a solvothermal method involving imidazolium-based ionic liquids and ethylene glycol. The 3 D self-assembled marigold-like materials were effective photocatalysts for degrading organic pollutants and generating hydrogen. The main advantages of the new materials were large surface area, high surface-to-bulk ratio, facile species transportation, and ease of recovery and regeneration. By using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method involving titanium tetrafluoride and a tetrafluoroborate-based ionic liquid (1 -butyl- 3 -methyl-imidazolium-tetrafluoroborate), a micro-sheet anatase TiO 2 single crystal photocatalyst with remarkable 80 % reactive facets was synthesized. The as-obtained TiO 2 single-crystal exhibited a truncated tetragonal <b>bipyramidal</b> <b>shape.</b> The high reactivity of facets made these single crystals highly photocatalytically active. They were easily recyclable and thermally stable up to 800 °C. Furthermore, a simple and environmentally benign approach for the synthesis of photocatalytically active rutile TiO 2 mesocrystals was developed. It was a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method involving titanium(III) chloride as the only reactant. The resulting 1 D rutile nanowires could easily assemble into 3 D hierarchical architectures without the help of surfactants or additives. The average aspect ratio for the nanowires was 267. The BET specific surface area of the mesocrystal was 16 m 2 /g. Part I: Size-tunable monodispersed hierarchical metallic Ni nanocrystals (58 - 190 nm in diameter) were prepared by the reduction of Ni 2 + with hexadecylamine under atmospheric pressure. The diameter of the particles could be tuned by simply changing the reaction time. A reaction mechanism was proposed and the relationships between the size, hierarchical surfaces and the magnetic properties were investigated. The as synthesized Ni crystals exhibited higher coercivities than the bulk metallic material owing to the reduced size and the hierarchical surface structure. The saturation magnetization (Ms) and the ratio of remanence to saturation (Mr/Ms) increased with increasing particle size. Part II: A facile microwave-assisted solvothermal method was developed for the controlled synthesis of novel 3 D CdS structures. Dendrite-, star-, popcorn- and hollow sphere-like CdS structures could be obtained by changing the reaction conditions including the reaction temperature and the amounts of reagents and solvents. The results revealed that the final structures were related to the solvent properties such as surface tension and viscosity. The degree of supersaturation was also responsible for the morphology variation and it could be adjusted by the reaction temperature. The CdS products with different morphologies exhibited interesting shape-dependent optical properties and photocatalytic activities. The optical band energy of the product exhibited an obvious red-shift of 0. 2 eV with aspect to that of pure rutile TiO 2. This red-shift effect may be ascribed to the high aspect ratio of the rutile nanowires. The products showed excellent photocatalytic activity for NO removal in air and the activity was well maintained after three cycles. Gold modification on the rutile TiO 2 resulted in a 50 % improvement in the photocatalytic performance. This thesis focuses primarily on the preparation of various functional materials with controllable structures and properties. The first part describes the synthesis of materials by solvothermal methods. The second part describes the rapid fabrication of novel semiconductor materials by microwave-assisted methods.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the early}} days of iron {{metallurgy}} in Western Europe, the most widespread type of 'trade iron' (semi-product) was <b>bipyramidal</b> in <b>shape.</b> Although they are frequently found, little is known about how they were manufactured and circulated, or even about their age. An interdisciplinary approach was applied to the Durrenentzen deposit (Haut-Rhin, France), the third-largest in Europe in terms of artefact quantities, in an attempt to reconstruct the technological, social and economic context that caused them to be abandoned. A morphometric study of the 51 iron bars revealed a high degree of homogeneity, despite variations in detail. Four objects were selected for archaeometric studies. Metallographic analyses show internal differences (quality of the material, nature of the alloys and manufacturing techniques). Chemical analyses also showed different provenances. Finally, radiocarbon analyses of the carbon in steel (iron/carbon alloy) linked this deposit to the early Iron Age.

Though no basic {{differences in the}} trigonal biprymidal stereochemistry about the zinc atom have been found, significant departures from planarity have been detected within the terpyridyl ligand. A crystal structure analysis of Sn₂Me₄Cl₄ terpyridyl has confirmed that it is monochloro bismethyl 2, 2; 2 ” terpyridyl tin(IV) trichloro bismethyl stannate(IV) and is therefore made up of tin-based 5 -coordinate anions and 6 -coordinate cations. The 5 -coordinate anion is trigonal <b>bipyramidal</b> in <b>shape,</b> with two methyl groups and one chlorine atom in the equatorial plane, apical positions being occupied by chlorine atoms. The 6 -coordinate cation has a distorted octahedral shape. Nitrogen atoms of the terpyridyl group, the tin atom and the chlorine atom all make up one plane.

A phase showing variable composition in the range P₄ 8 ₅ to P₄S₆. ₉ is found from crystal structure analysis to be made up of molecules isostructural with P₄S₇. Explanation of the variable composition is provided by the partial absence of some of the terminal sulphur atoms. A crystal structural analysis of the compound P₂S₆Br₂ has established the presence of a new six membered ring.
