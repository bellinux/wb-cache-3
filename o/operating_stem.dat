Although NMD is well characterized in yeast and mammals, plant NMD is poorly understood. We have undertaken the functional dissection of NMD pathways in plants. Using {{an approach that}} allows rapid identification of plant NMD trans factors, we demonstrated that two plant NMD pathways coexist, one eliminates mRNAs with long 3 ′UTRs, whereas a distinct pathway degrades mRNAs harbouring 3 ′UTR-located introns. We showed that UPF 1, UPF 2 and SMG- 7 are involved in both plant NMD pathways, whereas Mago and Y 14 are required only for intron-based NMD. The molecular mechanism of long 3 ′UTR-based plant NMD resembled yeast NMD, whereas the intron-based NMD was similar to mammalian NMD, suggesting that both pathways are evolutionarily conserved. Interestingly, the SMG- 7 NMD component is targeted by NMD, suggesting that plant NMD is autoregulated.

Much earlier analysis of the prosodic features of neighbouring Teke-Kukuya (Paulian 1975, Hyman 1987) provides a helpful reference point for this study.

We have previously shown that the stem cell pool in short-lived DBA/ 2 (D 2) mice is reduced during aging, in contrast to long-lived C 57 BL/ 6 (136) mice. This suggests {{the existence of a}} genetically determined mitotic clock <b>operating</b> in <b>stem</b> cells, which possibly limits organismal aging. In the study reported here, unfractionated bone marrow (BM) cells or highly purified Lin(-) Sca- 1 (+) c-kit(+) (LSK) cells were serially transplanted in lethally irradiated D 2 and B 6 mice. In both strains, serial transplantation resulted in a substantial loss of stem cell activity. However, as we estimate that in B 6 mice, the maximum number of population doublings of primitive cells is approximately 30, in D 2 mice this is only approximately 20, resulting in a 1, 000 -fold difference in expansion potential, irrespective of whether whole bone marrow or purified hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were transplanted. Interestingly, recipients reconstituted with serially transplanted BM cells were able to accept a freshly isolated graft without any further conditioning. Finally, we show that whereas transplantation of BM cells into healthy, nonconditioned, young B 6 recipients does not lead to engraftment, young BM cells do engraft and provide multilineage reconstitution in nonirradiated aged mice. Our data clearly establish the relevance of an intrinsic, genetically controlled program associated with impaired stem cell functioning during aging...|$|R

There was no correlation between migration of the prosthetic components and wear of the acetabular cup in 14 patients after 3 years. This opposes the opinion that early migration is caused by wear products. The relation between bone loss and loosening was studied in 11 cases operated on with a mega prosthesis. In 8 cases there was severe cortical atrophy, but only one femoral component was loose. Consequently, stress-shielding does not cause loosening. The failure rate after revision is high.

40|$|D. Tech. Organisational Leadership. Business School. The {{development}} of a quality framework for services in a shared services environment {{was the focus of}} the study. The shared services model has recently become an attractive organisational structure with many conglomerate multinational corporates. Shared services can be defined as a concentration of internal support services, professionally managed as an internal services business unit rendering the necessary services to the organisation’s business units. The shared services concept is not about centralisation. It is based on the existence of an internal supplier-customer relationship, where the power of the demand and nature of the services rest with the various business units. The literature has shown that the benefits of the shared services model include a reduction in the operating costs, improvements in efficiency of the corporate and in a higher level of internal customer satisfaction. Many practitioners have documented the fact that a reduction of <b>operating</b> costs <b>stems</b> from the elimination of duplicated services and providing service offerings at a greater economy of scale. In addition, business units can concentrate their efforts on the improvement of sales, thus lowering the percentage of the cost of sales. Efficiencies are improved by acquiring better technologies made possible by proportioning the costs to the various business units. The customer satisfaction levels of services from shared services centres have not materialised as per the literature. In recent research, shared services customers reported that they were dissatisfied with the quality of services and felt {{that there is a need}} for intervention to improve the quality of the services.
