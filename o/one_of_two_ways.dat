5|$|This module {{starts in}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> If {{the players have}} {{finished}} Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, they have been transported to the glacial rift via the magic chain. They will {{know that they are}} searching for some force behind the giant alliance. If the players are starting with Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, then they have been hired by nobles to destroy the frost giants. Either way, a safe, hidden cave is easily found for a base of operations.|$|E
5|$|To develop, {{the larvae}} must be fed both nectar for {{carbohydrates}} and pollen for protein. Bumblebees feed nectar to the larvae by chewing {{a small hole}} in the brood cell into which they regurgitate nectar. Larvae are fed pollen in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways,</b> depending on the bumblebee species. Pocket-making bumblebees create pockets of pollen {{at the base of}} the brood-cell clump from which the larvae feed themselves. Pollen-storing bumblebees keep pollen in separate wax pots and feed it to the larvae.|$|E
5|$|All {{weapons and}} apparel {{found within the}} Wastelands, {{regardless}} of whether they are a makeshift-weapon such as a lead pipe, or a gun, degrade over time the more they are used, and thus become less effective. For firearms, degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading, while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks. When too much damage is taken, the items breaks and cannot be used. To ensure weapons and apparel are working effectively, such items require constant maintenance and repairs which can be done in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> The first method is find certain vendors that repair items, though how much they can repair an item depends on their skill level, while the cost of the repairs depends upon the item itself. The second method is for players to find a second of the same item that needs repairs (or a comparable item), and salvaging parts from it for the repair, though how much they can do depends on their character's own skill level in repairs.|$|E

5000|$|In rugby union, a {{drop kick}} {{is used for}} the {{kick-off}} and restarts and to score a field or drop goal. Originally it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> only <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> to score points, along with the place kick.|$|R
50|$|The NTLM {{protocol}} {{also uses}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> functions, {{depending on the}} NTLM version. NT LanMan and NTLM version 1 use the DES based LanMan one way function (LMOWF), while NTLMv2 uses the NT MD4 based one way function (NTOWF).|$|R

25|$|In {{classical}} art Gaia {{was represented}} in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> In Athenian vase painting she was shown as a matronly woman only half {{risen from the}} earth, often {{in the act of}} handing the baby Erichthonius (a future king of Athens) to Athena to foster (see example below). In mosaic representations, she appears as a woman reclining upon the earth surrounded by a host of Carpi, infant gods of the fruits of the earth (see example below).|$|E
50|$|The {{water for}} the laconica baths was heated <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> {{different}} <b>ways.</b> The first being by direct coal burning fires and the other being the hot rock method, which consists of heating up rocks in another room and bringing them inside the bath.|$|R
5000|$|The {{relationship}} between the ordinary generating functions is sometimes called the Euler transform. It commonly makes its appearance in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> different <b>ways.</b> In <b>one</b> form, {{it is used to}} accelerate the convergence of an alternating series. That is, one has the identity ...|$|R
50|$|Referendum on an Existing Law - This {{referendum}} {{sought to}} eliminate <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> {{in which students}} may authorize fees to be assessed on tuition bills at state-operated colleges and universities to support nonpartisan student organizations that attempt to influence state legislation.|$|R
25|$|Vacancies in {{a council}} seat may be filled in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways,</b> {{either by the}} holding of a {{by-election}} or through direct appointment of an interim councillor chosen by the council in an internal vote. Normally the council is allowed to decide which process to follow in each individual case; however, if the vacancy occurs after March 31 {{in the year of}} a regularly scheduled municipal election, then the vacancy must be filled by direct appointment as provincial law prohibits the holding of a by-election in the final six months of a council term.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergency}} {{detection system}} (EDS) sensed initial development of {{conditions in the}} flight vehicle during the boost phases of flight which could cause vehicle failure. The EDS reacted to these emergency situations in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> If breakup of the vehicle were imminent, an automatic abort sequence would be initiated. If, however, the emergency condition were developing slowly enough or were of such a nature that the flight crew can evaluate it and take action, only visual indications were provided to the flight crew. Once an abort sequence had been initiated, either automatically or manually, it was irrevocable and ran to completion.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} {{has been criticized}} for its lack of troubleshooting support. Teachers in Peru are told to handle problems in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> If the problem is a software issue, they are to flash the computer, and if it is a hardware problem, they are to report it. In the classroom environment this black-boxing approach is being criticized for causing the teachers and students to feel disconnected with, and confused by the laptop, which results, in many cases, in the laptops eventually going unused. Several defects in OLPC XO-1 hardware have emerged in the field, and laptop repair is often neglected by students or their families (who are responsible for maintenance) due to the relatively high cost of some components (such as displays).|$|E
5000|$|Ponchatoula {{is located}} along Interstate 55 and Louisiana Highway 22, {{equidistant}} from New Orleans and Baton Rouge. In the early 1900s, Ponchatoula was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> only <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> {{to get to}} New Orleans by land, giving it the moniker [...] "Gateway to New Orleans." ...|$|R
50|$|Strangling is {{compression}} {{of the neck}} {{that may lead to}} unconsciousness or death by causing an increasingly hypoxic state in the brain. Fatal strangling typically occurs in cases of violence, accidents, and is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> main <b>ways</b> that hanging may cause death (alongside breaking the victim's neck).|$|R
50|$|The Commander {{has four}} {{directional}} indicators, but can only move one space at a time. If a player or team captures their opponent’s Commander(s), the game ends. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> alternate <b>ways</b> {{to end the}} game is to capture all of the opponent’s pieces except for the Commander(s).|$|R
25|$|Viscoelastic creep {{data can}} be {{presented}} in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> Total strain can be plotted {{as a function of}} time for a given temperature or temperatures. Below a critical value of applied stress, a material may exhibit linear viscoelasticity. Above this critical stress, the creep rate grows disproportionately faster. The second way of graphically presenting viscoelastic creep in a material is by plotting the creep modulus (constant applied stress divided by total strain at a particular time) as a function of time. Below its critical stress, the viscoelastic creep modulus is independent of stress applied. A family of curves describing strain versus time response to various applied stress may be represented by a single viscoelastic creep modulus versus time curve if the applied stresses are below the material's critical stress value.|$|E
25|$|Noam Chomsky's Principles and Parameters {{theory in}} the 1980s {{introduced}} {{the idea that a}} small number of innate principles are common to every human language (e.g. phrases are oriented around heads), and that these general principles are subject to parametric variation (e.g. the order of heads and other phrasal components may differ). In this theory, the dependency relation between heads, complements, specifiers, and adjuncts is regulated by X-bar theory, proposed by Jackendoff in the 1970s. The complement is sister to the head, and they can be ordered in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> A head-complement order is called a head-initial structure, while a complement-head order is called a head-final structure. These are special cases of Tesnière's centripetal and centrifugal structures, since here only complements are considered, whereas Tesnière considered all types of dependents.|$|E
25|$|Lead {{replacement}} may {{be done in}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> Insert {{a new set of}} leads without {{removing the}} current leads (not recommended as it provides additional obstruction to blood flow and heart valve function) or remove the current leads and then insert replacements. The lead removal technique will vary depending on the surgeon's estimation of the probability that simple traction will suffice to more complex procedures. Leads can normally be disconnected from the pacemaker easily which is why device replacement usually entails simple surgery to access the device and replace it by simply unhooking the leads from the device to replace and hooking the leads to the new device. The possible complications, such as perforation of the heart wall, come from removing the lead{s} from the patient's body.|$|E

50|$|The Frontier Town Station {{is located}} in the back of Cedar Point in front of Mean Streak, and next to the Maverick. At one time this station was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> only <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> to enter Frontier Town. The station {{building}} itself is not very large and does not resemble a traditional train station.|$|R
25|$|Inversion of Generation 2 devices was {{achieved}} through <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> different <b>ways.</b> The Inverter tube uses electrostatic inversion, {{in the same}} manner as the first generation tubes did, with a MCP included. Proximity focused second generation tubes could also be inverted by using a fiber bundle with a 180 degree twist in it.|$|R
25|$|Scrolls can {{be rolled}} in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> The first {{method is to}} wrap the scroll around a single core, similar to a modern roll of paper towels. While simple to construct, a single core scroll has a major disadvantage: in order to read text {{at the end of}} the scroll, the entire scroll must be unwound. This is {{partially}} overcome in the second method, which is to wrap the scroll around two cores, as in a Torah. With a double scroll, the text can be accessed from both beginning and end, and the portions of the scroll not being read can remain wound. This still leaves the scroll a sequential-access medium: to reach a given page, one generally has to unroll and re-roll many other pages.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the island}} {{location}} {{and the fact that}} the Cook Islands produce a significant array of fruits and vegetables, natural local produce, especially coconut, features in many of the dishes of the islands as does fresh seafood. While most food is imported from New Zealand, there are several Growers' Associations, such as Mangaian, Ngatangiia, Penrhyn, Puaikura, and Rakahanga, which contribute produce for local cuisine. Typical local cuisine includes arrowroot, clams, octopus, and taro, and seasonings such as fresh ginger, lime, lemon, basil, garlic and coconut. Rukau is a dish of taro leaves cooked with coconut sauce and onion. [...] A meal of octopus is known locally as Eke, and suckling pig is known as Puaka. Ika mata is a dish of raw fish marinated with lemon or lime and served with coconut cream, while Pai Ika and Keke Ika are also local fish fare. Poke is a dessert which can be made in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways,</b> either with banana and coconut milk or with pawpaw. Soursop, oranges and mangos are popular as juices. Coconut water, local beer (Cooks Lager), and coffee are popular beverages among the Cook Islanders.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of plumes at the volcanoes Pele and Loki {{were the first}} sign that Io is geologically active. Generally, these plumes are formed when volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide are ejected skyward from Io's volcanoes at speeds reaching , creating umbrella-shaped clouds of gas and dust. Additional material that might be found in these volcanic plumes include sodium, potassium, and chlorine. These plumes appear to be formed in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> Io's largest plumes, such as those emitted by Pele, are created when dissolved sulfur and sulfur dioxide gas are released from erupting magma at volcanic vents or lava lakes, often dragging silicate pyroclastic material with them. These plumes form red (from the short-chain sulfur) and black (from the silicate pyroclastics) deposits on the surface. Plumes formed in this manner are among the largest observed at Io, forming red rings more than [...] in diameter. Examples of this plume type include Pele, Tvashtar, and Dazhbog. Another type of plume is produced when encroaching lava flows vaporize underlying sulfur dioxide frost, sending the sulfur skyward. This type of plume often forms bright circular deposits consisting of sulfur dioxide. These plumes are often less than [...] tall, and {{are among the most}} long-lived plumes on Io. Examples include Prometheus, Amirani, and Masubi. The erupted sulfurous compounds are concentrated in the upper crust from a decrease in sulfur solubility at greater depths in Io's lithosphere.|$|E
50|$|Integrated pilot {{training}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> aviators may {{train to}} become qualified. Pilots will normally enter into an ab-initio scheme with a Flight Training Organisation (FTO) {{where they may}} have as little as zero hours flight experience, up to or above the minimum requirements {{of the law of}} that country or ICAO state.|$|R
2500|$|Maimonides {{taught that}} the {{encounter}} where [...] reports, [...] "God said to him: ‘Your name is Jacob," [...] is {{an instance of}} where a prophet reports the words of an angel without mentioning that they were perceived in a dream or vision, assuming that {{it is well known}} that prophecy can only originate in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b>|$|R
50|$|Once {{chemical}} {{signatures of}} regions of water are identified, the otoliths {{can be analyzed}} for comparison. Otoliths are examined and analyzed in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> basic <b>ways.</b> The entire otolith can be sampled, or {{a portion of the}} otolith can be isolated through a targeted assay. Both approaches begin with careful cleaning and preparation of the otoliths to be analyzed.|$|R

2500|$|Lightning {{can cause}} ionospheric {{perturbations}} in the D-region in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> The first is through VLF (very low frequency) radio waves launched into the magnetosphere. These so-called [...] "whistler" [...] mode waves can interact with radiation belt particles and {{cause them to}} precipitate onto the ionosphere, adding ionization to the D-region. These disturbances are called [...] "lightning-induced electron precipitation" [...] (LEP) events.|$|E
2500|$|In other words, {{physical}} simulators usually function <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways,</b> {{where the}} collision is detected a posteriori (after the collision occurs) or a priori (before the collision occurs). In {{addition to the}} a posteriori and a priori distinction, almost all modern collision detection algorithms are broken into a hierarchy of algorithms. Often the terms [...] "discrete" [...] and [...] "continuous" [...] are used rather than a posteriori and a priori.|$|E
5000|$|An author's note {{suggests}} that the book would best be read in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> possible <b>ways,</b> either progressively from chapters 1 to 56 or by [...] "hopscotching" [...] through the entire set of 155 chapters according to a [...] "Table of Instructions" [...] designated by the author. Cortázar also leaves the reader the option of choosing a unique path through the narrative.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a trace semantics of exceptions and then derive a weakest precondition semantics. A program that contains exceptions terminates in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> possible <b>ways</b> (if it terminates at all) : either it terminates exceptionally or it terminates normally. We will therefore consider weakest preconditions that are functions <b>of</b> <b>two</b> postconditions. As a preparation we study aribitrary functions <b>of</b> <b>two</b> arguments, and their compositions...|$|R
50|$|Intrusions are <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> {{igneous rock}} can form; {{the other is}} {{extrusive}} rock, that is, a volcanic eruption or similar event. Technically speaking, an intrusion is any formation of intrusive igneous rock; rock formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of the planet. In contrast, an extrusion consists of extrusive rock; rock formed above {{the surface of the}} crust.|$|R
