40|$|Use of fuel <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>woody</b> {{generally}} {{has been limited}} to rice husk and other residues are rarely tried as a fuel in a gasification system. With the availability of woody biomass in most countries like India, alternates fuels are being explored for sustainable supply of fuel. Use of agro residues has been explored after briquetting. There are few feedstock's like coconut fronts, maize cobs, etc, that might require lesser preprocessing steps compared to briquetting. The paper presents a detailed investigation into using coconut fronds as a fuel in an open top down draft gasification system. The fuel has ash content of 7 % and was dried to moisture levels of 12 %. The average bulk density {{was found to be}} 230 kg/m 3 with a fuel size particle of an average size 40 mm as compared to 350 kg/m 3 for a standard wood pieces. A typical dry coconut fronds weighs about 2. 5 kgs and on an average 6 m long and 90 % of the frond is the petiole which is generally used as a fuel. The focus was also to compare the overall process with respect to operating with a typical woody biomass like subabul whose ash content is 1 %. The open top gasification system consists of a reactor, cooling and cleaning system along with water treatment. The performance parameters studied were the gas composition, tar and particulates in the clean gas, water quality and reactor pressure drop apart from other standard data collection of fuel flow rate, etc. The average gas composition was found to be CO 15 1. 0 % H- 2 16 +/- 1 % CH 4 0. 5 +/- 0. 1 % CO 2 12. 0 +/- 1. 0 % and rest N 2 compared to CO 19 +/- 1. 0 % H- 2 17 +/- 1. 0 %, CH 4 1 +/- 0. 2 %, CO 2 12 +/- 1. 0 % and rest N 2. The tar and particulate content in the clean gas {{has been found to be}} about 10 and 12 mg/m 3 in both cases. The presence of high ash content material increased the pressure drop with coconut frond compared to woody biomass...|$|E

40|$|The {{idea that}} {{herbaceous}} plants have higher relative growth rates (RGRs) compared with woody plants {{is fundamental to}} many of the most influential theories in plant ecology. This difference in growth rate is thought to reflect systematic variation in physiology, allocation and leaf construction. Previous studies documenting this effect have, however, ignored differences in seed mass. As woody species often have larger seeds and RGR is negatively correlated with seed mass, it is entirely possible the lower RGRs observed in woody species is a consequence of having larger seeds rather than different growth strategies. Using a synthesis of the published literature, we explored the relationship between RGR and growth form, accounting for the effects of seed mass and study-specific effects (e. g. duration of study and pot volume), using a mixed-effects model. The model showed that herbaceous species do indeed have higher RGRs <b>than</b> <b>woody</b> species, and that the difference was independent of seed mass, thus at all seed masses, herbaceous species on average grow faster <b>than</b> <b>woody</b> ones...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{awareness}} is increasing globally {{and the demand}} for composite materials that possessed ‘green’ characteristic such as degradability and recyclability along with excellent mechanical and physical properties are also increased. Bamboo being a type of grass that is commonly available almost in every part of the world can be a suitable candidate. The main objective {{of this study is to}} determine the suitability of Beting bamboo (Gigantochloa thoii) as a raw material for bamboo-aluminum sandwich composites fabrication. Prior to that, the evaluation of physical and mechanical properties of Beting bamboo such as specific gravity, equilibrium moisture content, flexural and compression strength and stiffness, pH, buffering capacity and wettability were carried out. Additionally, surface properties of modified aluminum alloy and bamboo surface treated using silane coupling agent in water medium and also the adhesive shear strength between the bamboo-bamboo laminate and bamboo-aluminum laminate were also conducted. Prototype of bamboo-bamboo aluminum composites was prepared in the laboratory and the mechanical properties of the composites were also evaluated. It was concluded from the study that the prototype of composites exhibit good mechanical properties and Beting bamboo was technically suitable as a raw materials for fabrication of composites products although the specific gravity was found to be higher <b>than</b> <b>other</b> <b>woody</b> materials. The output of this research might contribute in development of green composites materials to meet the demand of rapidly rising market demand for green composite...|$|R

50|$|A marsh is a wetland that is {{dominated}} by herbaceous rather <b>than</b> <b>woody</b> plant species. Marshes can often {{be found at the}} edges of lakes and streams, where they form a transition between the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. They are often dominated by grasses, rushes or reeds. If woody plants are present they tend to be low-growing shrubs. This form of vegetation is what differentiates marshes from other types of wetland such as swamps, which are dominated by trees, and mires, which are wetlands that have accumulated deposits of acidic peat.|$|R

50|$|In gardening, {{clipping}} {{is equivalent}} to pruning, the practice of removing diseases, over mature or otherwise unwanted portions from a plant.

50|$|Evapotranspiration is a {{significant}} water loss from drainage basins. Types of vegetation and land use significantly affect evapotranspiration, and therefore {{the amount of water}} leaving a drainage basin. Because water transpired through leaves comes from the roots, plants with deep reaching roots can more constantly transpire water. Herbaceous plants generally transpire less <b>than</b> <b>woody</b> plants because they usually have less extensive foliage. Conifer forests tend to have higher rates of evapotranspiration than deciduous forests, particularly in the dormant and early spring seasons. This is primarily due to the enhanced amount of precipitation intercepted and evaporated by conifer foliage during these periods. Factors that affect evapotranspiration include the plant's growth stage or level of maturity, percentage of soil cover, solar radiation, humidity, temperature, and wind. Isotope measurements indicate transpiration is the larger component of evapotranspiration.|$|R

Mycological investigations were performed to list the presence of both epigeous and hypogeous macrofungal species in the historical Hanbury Botanical Gardens.

Ectomycorrhizal species and soil saprotrophs were more numerous <b>than</b> <b>woody</b> decaying and parasite fungi. This site, declared a Regional Protected Area and a Site of Community Importance for its high plant biodiversity, also constitutes an interesting area from a mycological perspective.
