Voted {{on by the}} tournament directorate, the first awards {{recognised}} the top goaltender, forward and defenceman. In 1999, an award for {{the most valuable player}} was added. There is also an all-star team voted on by members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media.</b> <b>In</b> 2004, Canadian Dany Heatley became the first player to lead in scoring, win the MVP award, win the best forward award and be named to the all-star team in the same year. He repeated the feat in 2008.|$|E

25|$|In {{a country}} with a {{population}} around 10 million, these 'books' are published in 2 to 5000 copies, which is extremely low, causing relatively high prices.

Wisden defended the list stating that performances which majorly contributed to victories received a much larger weighting than those in which the match was drawn or lost. Tendulkar's most important innings had usually come in draws and defeats which received a lower weighting.|$|E

25|$|The Revolution brought Romania vast {{attention}} from the outside world. Initially, much of the world's sympathy went to the National Salvation Front government under Ion Iliescu, {{a former member of}} the Communist Party leadership and a Ceaușescu ally prior to falling into the dictator's disfavor in the early 1980s. The National Salvation Front, composed mainly of former members of the second echelon of the Communist Party, immediately assumed control over the state institutions, including the main media outlets such as the national radio and television networks. They used their control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>in</b> order to launch attacks against their political opponents, newly created political parties that claimed to be successors to those existing before 1948.|$|E

25|$|That said, in {{previous}} elections, approximate forecasting of results were achieved by {{assuming that the}} swing in each individual constituency {{will be the same}} across the country. This system, known as uniform national swing (UNS) is used by much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>in</b> Britain to assess and extrapolate electoral fortunes from opinion poll data, though there has been criticism that such predictions may be naive and unreliable, even from providers of such data. By using UNS projections, several media commentators and politicians have suggested that significant swings towards the Liberal Democrats in the opinion polls may not necessarily amount to significant gains in terms of parliamentary seats, including predictions that even if the Liberal Democrats had the most votes, and Labour the least, it could be the case that Labour retains the most seats while the Lib Dems have the fewest.|$|E
25|$|The series {{continued}} with Scream 2, premiering at Mann's Chinese Theater, followed by general release in December 1997, again written by Williamson {{and directed by}} Craven, released {{less than a year}} after the original film. Like Scream, the film features characters aware of the horror genre and the conventions of the horror sequel, mocking them while simultaneously falling victim to them. The film again focuses on the character of Sidney Prescott, now a college student, as a series of copycat crimes begin, the killers again using the disguise of Ghostface. The film was financially successful, deviating from its predecessor's worldwide gross by less than US$1 million and receiving similar critical praise for its deconstruction of the horror film sequel and commentary on the influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>in</b> society. The script for Scream 2 was leaked during production revealing the identity of the killers and so the film underwent extensive rewrites, changing the identity of the killers though their motivation remained intact.|$|E
25|$|In November 1935, a {{decision}} was made to convert the entire works to use the Activated Sludge system. Renewal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>in</b> the primary and secondary bacteria beds ceased, and by September 1936, both of the media washing plants had been dismantled. Railway tracks around the primary beds were removed during 1937. Rolling stock on the railway consisted of one steam locomotive and two diesels, bought in 1935 from Hudswell Clarke. Construction of a new sludge digestion plant and two secondary sludge digestion tanks was finished in June 1939, and two new settlement tanks were completed in 1940. Five large lagoons were built at Flixton in 1941, which could be used to store sludge in an emergency. The Mancunium sank after hitting a mine in the Mersey estuary in January 1941, but all of the crew were rescued. Parts of the works were damaged by bombs in March and May 1941 and in January 1942. Transport of sludge to the sea was maintained by borrowing the Shieldhall from Glasgow Corporation, until a new Mancunium was built by Ferguson Bros. of Glasgow. It arrived at the works on 27 December 1946.|$|E

25|$|In 2004 Davíð's {{government}} became {{embroiled in}} controversy, when he {{introduced a bill}} which {{would have made it}} impossible for large private companies to own more than 15% of any one media company, and under which newspapers and television stations could not be owned by the same company. Davíð argued that this was to prevent concentration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>in</b> the hands of a few people, and to enable the media to remain independent and critical not only towards politicians, but also towards financial moguls. His critics maintained, however, that the proposal was directly aimed at Baugur Group which they claimed Davíð regarded as a political enemy. By then, Baugur had bought another newspaper, the television station from Jón Ólafsson and a few radio stations, and controlled {{more than half of the}} media market. The Alþingi passed a much-softened version of the media bill. But in summer 2004, for the first time in the history of the Icelandic Republic, the president, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, refused to sign the bill into law. Davíð criticized this, pointing out that the director of the television station formerly owned by Jón Ólafsson and recently bought by Baugur, Sigurður G. Guðjónsson, had been Ólafur Ragnar's campaign manager in his first presidential campaign, and that Ólafur's daughter was employed by Baugur. However, Baugur enjoyed considerable goodwill in Iceland because their shops offered lower prices than competitors, while their owners, Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson and Jóhannes Jónsson, were seen as an embodiment of an Icelandic dream of rags-to-riches. Many people agreed that the media bill seemed to be a part of a political duel rather than an attempt to make general law. The conclusion of the long struggle was that Davíð Oddsson withdrew the bill instead of holding a national referendum on it, as required by the Icelandic constitution in the event that the president refuses to sign a bill into law.|$|E

500|$|A key {{foundation}} of the [...] "underrated" [...] school's argument, Pollock wrote, was the tendency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>in</b> most Arab countries to be under state control or influence {{to a greater degree}} than in the West and therefore filtering information to the public and not reporting public opinion accurately, an experience informed by contemporary events in Eastern Europe. However, even in Syria, a coalition country where the government had the greatest control over the media, citizens still listened to the BBC, Radio Monte Carlo and Israeli and Saudi radio stations. In other countries, particularly some in North Africa, the media was relatively unrestricted during the conflict. Those mystified by the quiet on the Arab street during the conflict, he said, [...] "neglected... the possibility that different Arab publics generally supported the different policies pursued by their own governments towards the crisis." ...|$|E
