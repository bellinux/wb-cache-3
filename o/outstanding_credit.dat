40|$|This paper {{estimates}} a single-equation {{model to}} analyse the main explanatory factors behind changes in Spanish household credit, {{considering that the}} behaviour of its determinants is exogenous. According to the evidence reported, household borrowing is determined {{in the long run}} by real spending, gross wealth and the repayment term for <b>outstanding</b> <b>credits,</b> which have a positive influence, and by the cost of loans and the unemployment rate, the effect of which is of a negative sign. Developments in the short run are influenced by changes in long-term interest rates and in employment. The evidence offered suggests that, in general terms, the financing received by households over the period analysed is in line with what may be inferred from its determinants; however, the high volume of debt incurred entails greater exposure of the sector to unexpected changes in its income, in its wealth or in the cost of borrowing, especially in a setting in which floating-rate loans are increasingly significant. credit, household, error correction...|$|R

40|$|The paper aims at {{shedding}} {{light on}} the non-concessional borrowing situations in LICs and reviews the recent World Bank policy proposal that has a stated aim of guarding against accumulation of unsustainable debts in LICs. We also offer suggestions for promoting sustainable debt positions in LICs through policy actions by national governments and international development partners, particularly the World Bank. We first review the profiles and stylized facts on non-concessional borrowing in the countries. Our review shows that natural resource rich countries and countries in conflicts (that are therefore in arrears with BWIs) account {{for the bulk of}} non-concessional debt stock and flows, particularly public and publicly guaranteed types. But it would not be illogical to anticipate that post-MDRI countries too could soon start (or might have just started) contracting non-concessional debts in sizeable amounts. We also highlight the geographical concentration of bilateral external credits that characterises many countries, with <b>outstanding</b> <b>credits</b> from emerging creditors like China, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia accounting for high percentage of GDP of the borrowing countries.

50|$|Declines {{in credit}} card debt are often misinterpreted because they fail to include {{information}} about charge-offs.

Inclusion of charged-off debt can therefore significantly impact debt trends and the characterization of a nation’s financial health. For example, the $10.3 billion decrease in <b>outstanding</b> <b>credit</b> card debt in Q3 2010 relative to the previous quarter might at first glance seem to be a significant consumer pay down.

The close identification from the first with the prosperous and flourishing Rhineland-Westphalia industry, and the strict adherence to its original purpose, lent strength to the Bankverein to weather the financial crisis of 1857 without the necessity of canceling any of its <b>outstanding</b> <b>credits</b> — a strong factor in extending its influence during succeeding years.
