5|$|Tests {{were carried}} out {{starting}} in October 1940, and quickly demonstrated a number of minor problems. One of the minor issues is that the crosshairs on the tube that indicated the center would block the spot. A more serious concern {{was the lack of}} range information, which the FIU pilots considered critical. Hanbury Brown went to work on these issues, and returned an updated version in December. A U-shaped reticle {{in the center of the}} display provided a centre location that left the spot visible. Additionally, the circuitry included a second timebase that produced a longer signal as the fighter approached its target. The output was timed so the line was centred horizontally <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dot.</b> This presented the range in an easily understandable fashion; the line looked like the wings of an aircraft, which naturally grow larger as the fighter approaches it.|$|E
25|$|All Morse code {{elements}} depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> length. A dash is {{the length of}} 3 dots, and spacings are specified in number of dot lengths. An unambiguous method of specifying the transmission speed is to specify the dot duration as, for example, 50milliseconds.|$|E
25|$|The mirror test allows {{scientists}} {{to determine whether}} birds are conscious of themselves and able to distinguish themselves from other animals by determining whether they possess or lack the ability to recognize themselves in their own reflections. European magpies are the only animals beside mammals that {{have been shown to}} be able to pass this test by trying to remove colored stickers from underneath their beaks when shown in a mirror. However, in 1981, Epstein, Lanza and Skinner published a paper in the journal Science in which they argued that pigeons also pass the mirror test. A pigeon was trained to look in a mirror to find a response key behind it which it then turned to peck—food was the consequence of a correct choice (i.e., the pigeon learned to use a mirror to find critical elements of its environment). Next, the bird was trained to peck at dots placed on its feathers; food was, again, the consequence of touching the dot. This was done without a mirror. Then a small bib was placed on the pigeon—enough to cover a dot placed on its lower belly. A control period without the mirror yielded no pecking at the dot. But when the mirror was shown, the pigeon became active, looked into it and then tried to peck <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> under the bib.|$|E

2500|$|Pigeons {{are capable}} of passing a highly {{modified}} mirror test, but only after extensive training. In the experiment, a pigeon was trained to look in a mirror to find a response key behind it, which the pigeon then turned to peck to obtain food. [...] Thus, the pigeon learned to use a mirror to find critical elements of its environment. Next, the pigeon was trained to peck at dots placed on its feathers; food was, again, the consequence of touching the dot. The latter training was accomplished {{in the absence of}} the mirror. The final test was placing a small bib on the pigeon—enough to cover a dot placed on its lower belly. A control period without the mirror present yielded no pecking at the dot. When the mirror was revealed, the pigeon became active, looked in the mirror and then tried to peck <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> under the bib. However, untrained pigeons have never passed the mirror test.|$|E
2500|$|In 1924, Bonciu {{married a}} Gabriela Kimmel, living, until 1934, in {{relative}} {{isolation from the}} literary scene. Early in the 1930s, the family had moved back to Iași, where Bonciu {{set up a new}} business in the production and distribution of Moldavian wine. On his vineyard, covering some 15 hectares outside of Miroslava, the writer created sweet [...] "Uricani wine", seen by some oenologists as one of Romania's finest, and a very popular drink throughout the country. The passion for wine-making later resulted in a friendship between Bonciu and celebrated actor-satirist Constantin Tănase; the latter acclimatized Uricani trunks at his own villa, in Balotești. Bonciu was a regular gambler and drinker, who supplied the bohemian society of Iași with affordable wine. Humorist Păstorel Teodoreanu, who attended this society, recalls: [...] "Old folks in Iași may still remember Bonciu's devout wine, that every Iași inhabitant back in the day would gorge on at their own will, in Tuflii Café, for 2,50 lei a bottle. [...] Just about every afternoon, the cart would stop <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> at Unirii Square, facing Traian Café, where [...] would habitually play a game of chess. Waiting for his master, the gray-haired cart driver would fall asleep on his seat".|$|E
