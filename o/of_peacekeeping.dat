5|$|There {{are about}} 50,000 Jordanian troops {{working with the}} United Nations in {{peacekeeping}} missions across the world. Jordan ranks third internationally in participation in U.N. peacekeeping missions, {{with one of the}} highest levels <b>of</b> <b>peacekeeping</b> troop contributions of all U.N. member states. Jordan has dispatched several field hospitals to conflict zones and areas affected by natural disasters across the region.|$|E
5|$|A {{string of}} new {{peacekeeping}} missions were launched in Namibia, Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Angola by the Security Council which also triggered {{interest in the}} reform of the 15-member body. Germany and Japan in particular, as well as India and Brazil, launched efforts to gain permanent seats and veto rights at the Council. In the late 1990s, Secretary-General Kofi Annan improved the coherence of the United Nations, with a better coordinated development system and more effective humanitarian structures. The fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic was energized, and a new concept of partnership between the United Nations and international business developed under the Global Compact. Other reforms included the revamping <b>of</b> <b>peacekeeping</b> operations following the Brahimi Report. The World Summit in 2005 recognized, albeit mainly symbolically, an international ‘responsibility to protect’ populations from genocide and the Human Rights Council replaced the discredited Commission on Human Rights.|$|E
5|$|In March 1995, while NATO was {{planning}} {{a new strategy}} in support <b>of</b> <b>peacekeeping</b> operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a ceasefire brokered by former US President Jimmy Carter between the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine; ARBiH) and the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske; VRS) expired and fighting resumed. As the struggle gradually widened, the ARBiH launched a large-scale offensive around Sarajevo. In response, the VRS seized heavy weapons from a UN-guarded depot and began shelling targets around the city, prompting the UN commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant General Rupert Smith, to request NATO air strikes against the VRS. NATO responded on 25 and 26 May 1995 by bombing a VRS ammunition dump in the Bosnian Serb capital, Pale. The mission {{was carried out by}} United States Air Force F-16s and Spanish Air Force EF-18A Hornets armed with laser-guided bombs. In response, the VRS seized 377 UNPROFOR hostages and used them as human shields for a variety of potential targets in Bosnia and Herzegovina, forcing NATO to end the air strikes.|$|E

5|$|The ADF {{currently}} has several forces deployed to the Middle East. The ADF's {{contribution to the}} Military intervention against ISIL makes up the largest overseas commitment with 780 personnel deployed as part of Operation Okra. As of November 2015, six F/A-18A Hornets, one E-7A Wedgetail and one KC-30A tanker were deployed to strike Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria. Approximately 380 personnel were deployed to Iraq {{as part of an}} international effort to provide training and other forms of assistance to the Iraqi military. Deployments in Afghanistan number 250 personnel in Operation Highroad, a non-combat training mission supporting the Afghan National Army. A frigate is also deployed to the Middle East in maritime security operations in and around the Gulf of Aden as part of the Combined Maritime Forces. Australian personnel also form part <b>of</b> <b>peacekeeping</b> missions in Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Sudan. The ADF has a further 400 personnel based in the Middle East to support operations in the region.|$|E

25|$|In {{contemporary}} conflict zones, international organizations, {{particularly the}} United Nations peacekeepers, {{have been involved}} in maintaining peace and stability in the area as well as distribute humanitarian aid to the local population. At present there are 16 Peace Operations directed by the UN Department <b>of</b> <b>Peacekeeping</b> Operations. The peacekeepers are mainly composed of military personnel (but to a less number also the police) sent by governments of various member-states. However, over the course of their involvement in the field, peacekeepers have also been accused and at times found guilty of committing rape and other forms of sexual violence to the local population, in particular to women and children. Among all international staff in the conflict zone, United Nations peacekeepers (handled by the Department <b>of</b> <b>Peacekeeping</b> Operations) have been most frequently identified as the perpetrators of rape.|$|E
25|$|Land Forces {{during this}} period also {{deployed}} in support <b>of</b> <b>peacekeeping</b> operations within United Nations sanctioned conflicts.

25|$|The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) {{is one of}} the {{principal}} organs of the United Nations and is charged with the maintenance of international peace and security.

25|$|Swedish troops led by Bernadotte {{took part}} in the Napoleonic Wars in 1813 and 1814, {{fighting}} against France (they had a small role at the Battle of Leipzig) and Denmark. Sweden forced Denmark to hand over Norway by the Treaty of Kiel. This was recognised by the Allied powers at the Congress of Vienna. Since this time Sweden has not taken part in armed warfare (with the exception <b>of</b> <b>peacekeeping).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War precipitated a {{dramatic}} shift in UN and multilateral peacekeeping. In a new spirit of cooperation, the Security Council established larger and more complex UN peacekeeping missions, often to help implement comprehensive peace agreements between belligerents in intra-State conflicts and civil wars. Furthermore, peacekeeping came to involve more and more non-military elements that ensured the proper functioning of civic functions, such as elections. The UN Department <b>of</b> <b>Peacekeeping</b> Operations was created in 1992 to support this increased demand for such missions.|$|E

25|$|In October 1919 Wilson warned Churchill {{that the}} planned {{introduction}} of Irish Home Rule that autumn {{would lead to}} trouble and, given concerns that Robertson lacked the subtlety for the Irish Command which Churchill had offered him, asked him to consult the Prime Minister, perhaps {{in the knowledge that}} Lloyd George disliked Robertson. Lloyd George preferred Macready, as he had experience <b>of</b> <b>peacekeeping</b> duties in South Wales and Belfast as well as having served as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in London, and he was appointed early in 1920.|$|E
25|$|A growing {{critique}} <b>of</b> <b>peacekeeping</b> is {{the lack}} of engagement between the peacekeeping officials and the local populace. As Severine Autessrre outlines in a 2015 Foreign Policy article, this creates an environment where the peacekeeping officials develop plans to ‘keep’ the peace, but they are disconnected from reality, having the opposite effect on the ground. Additionally, it creates a reinforcement mechanism for the peacekeeping officials, because the officials on the ground report that their plan was successfully implemented, but, in reality, it had adverse effects. If {{the situation on the ground}} turns into another outbreak of violence, the local populace will be blamed.|$|E
25|$|The notion <b>of</b> <b>peacekeeping</b> {{seems to}} be deeply {{embedded}} in Canadian culture and a distinguishing feature that Canadians feel sets their foreign policy apart {{from the likes of}} the United States. The Somalia commission wrote in 1997 that “Canada’s foreign policy with respect to peacekeeping has been consistent since Canadians embraced peacekeeping in the late 1950s”. Since the Suez Crisis, Canadian foreign policy has fit a peacekeeping rubric. Americans, however, were seen to fight wars, but Canadians pictured themselves as working for peace. Canada never had a reputation for starting wars but instead was seen to {{come to the aid of}} war-torn countries.|$|E

As Prime Minister, Pearson would advocate the simple Maple Leaf that was eventually adopted.|$|E
25|$|With Irish Home Rule due {{to become}} law in 1914, and the Cabinet contemplating {{some kind of}} {{military}} action against the Ulster Volunteers who {{wanted no part of}} it, French and Seely summoned Paget (Commander-in-Chief, Ireland) to the War Office for talks, whilst Seely wrote to the Prime Minister (24 October 1913) about the potential use of General Macready, who had experience <b>of</b> <b>peacekeeping</b> in the South Wales coalfields in 1910, and had been consulted by Birrell (Chief Secretary for Ireland) about the use of troops in the 1912 Belfast riots.

25|$|The United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) {{had been}} in Rwanda since October 1993, with a mandate to oversee the {{implementation}} of the Arusha Accords.

UNAMIR's effectiveness in peacekeeping was also hampered by President Habyarimana and Hutu hardliners, and by April 1994, the Security Council threatened to terminate UNAMIR's mandate if it did not make progress.|$|E
