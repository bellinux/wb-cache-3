50|$|<b>Out-feed</b> from tumbler {{screening}} machine can be monitored by proximity-type signal transmitter, which detects overload, blockage or screen breakage, by {{a change in}} the <b>out-feed</b> layer height which shows deviation from the optimum operating condition. Faulty production can be easily avoided.|$|E
50|$|One problem often {{encountered}} {{when using}} a thickness planer is snipe. This manifests as a deeper cut {{on a short}} section of the board at either end and is caused by incorrect feeding or misalignment of the in-feed or <b>out-feed</b> tables, or an unnecessarily high setting of the rollers recessed in {{the surface of the}} in-feed table. It can be accommodated by keeping the board overlong to allow later trimming.|$|E
50|$|In operation, {{the table}} is set to the desired height and then the machine is {{switched}} on. The board is fed into the machine until it makes contact with the in-feed roller which grips the board and draws it into the machine and past the rotating cutter head. The knives remove material on the way through and the <b>out-feed</b> roller pulls the board through and ejects it from the machine {{at the end of}} the pass.|$|E
5000|$|Snipe, in woodworking, is a noticeably deeper cut on {{the leading}} and/or {{trailing}} end of a board after having passed through a thickness planer or jointer. Its cause, in a jointer, is an <b>out-feed</b> table which is set too low relative to the cutter head, or in a thickness planer, an unnecessarily high setting of the Bed rollers of the in-feed table or a pressure bar which is set too high. [...] The term has its origin in forestry where it is applied to a sloping surface or bevel {{cut on the}} fore end of a log to ease dragging. (OED) ...|$|E
50|$|Scary sharp is {{a method}} of {{sharpening}} woodworking tools with sandpaper instead of conventional methods of oilstone or waterstone sharpening. The sandpaper referred to here can be any abrasive impregnated sheet used in the various industries to smooth surfaces and examples include glass paper, silicon carbide, emery cloth, etc. The sandpaper is affixed to another hard, flat substrate to create the sharpening surface. Sheet-glass is commonly used, but a machinist's granite surfacing block, marble baking slabs, plywood, medium-density fibreboard (MDF) or even jointer <b>out-feed</b> tables will produce satisfactory results. The method of fixation is usually {{a matter of the}} user's preference, and can include plain water (by means of surface tension), sprayed-on adhesive, or by simply using adhesive-backed abrasive paper. This is exactly the same method as that used by materials scientists in preparing polished samples for metallography.|$|E
