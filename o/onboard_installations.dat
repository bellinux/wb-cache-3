40|$|AbstractIn {{geophysical}} survey system, a Time Domain Electro-Magnetic (TDEM) technique {{is used to}} detect the presence of uranium in the earth crust. For heliborne survey, certain equipments, such as power converter and data acquisition system are installed on a helicopter. The power converter {{is responsible for the}} generation of high current pulses to feed the transmitter for setting up the required electromagnetic field. The power converter consists of a free running inverter, which sits over a DC-DC converter. Data acquisition system acquires data from various sensors for further processing and interpretation. Data acquisition system consists of a highly vibration sensitive onboard computer (IDAN boxes) rigidly mounted over a plate inside the data acquisition system enclosure. Since the power converter and data acquisition system are installed on the floor inside the surveying helicopter, it is mandatory to qualify these equipments for vibration & shock as per MIL standard before <b>onboard</b> <b>installation.</b> To evaluate the structural integrity of power converter and data acquisition system under various loading conditions of vibration and shock, a preliminary estimation of stresses and deflections was made by hand calculations and then, finite element analysis has been performed to optimize the design. Modal analysis has been performed to estimate the natural frequencies of power converter. Since the natural frequencies of the power converter were within the disturbing frequency range (i. e., 10 to 84 Hz), thickness of converter base plate and inverter base plate has been increased to avoid resonance. Since the data acquisition system consists of a highly vibration sensitive onboard computer, it has been proposed to mount it on isolators to minimize the vibration. To evaluate the structural integrity of data acquisition system under various loading conditions, finite element analysis has been performed. This paper presents the methodology adopted for design and analysis of the equipments for the specified input of vibration and shock...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of fuel-cell technology to aircraft propulsion and/or energy supply is becoming {{of great interest}} for undoubted advantages in terms of pollution emissions and noise, features particularly important for commuter airplanes that usually take off and land from and in urban areas. The conversion of conventional aircraft into more/all-electric one tends {{to be based on}} the installation of such innovative systems. A better understanding of problems related to fuel cells applied to aeronautics is sought by the European Commission funded project environmentally friendly intercity aircraft powered by fuel cells ENFICA-FC. The main objective of the ENFICA-FC project is to develop and to validate the use of a fuel-cell based power system for propulsion of an all-electric aircraft. The fuel-cell system will be installed in a light sport aircraft Rapid 200 that will be flown and performance tested as a proof of functionality and future applicability. Specific aspects have to be investigated in the <b>onboard</b> <b>installation</b> of the innovative system and new design indications have to be pointed out in order to fulfill the conversion. One of the key items under investigation is the simulation of existing cooling system and the evaluation of motor and fuel-cell temperature; the temperature has to be maintained within the limits established by manufacturers of critical systems during all likely operating conditions as indicated by aeronautic regulations for general aviation. The computational problem addressed in this paper is the numerical computational fluid dynamics CFD simulation of the existing air-cooling system that satisfies air request for cooling and venting. An engineering model has been developed and it is used to support air inlet and outlet design. The flow is reasonably approximated by a potential flow plus boundary layer; hence, total upstream pressure losses are neglected except for those within the thin boundary layer. Pressure recovery of incoming cooling air and pressure coefficient distribution have been studied by using VSAERO panel code, and the optimal position of cooling and venting intakes is defined according to aerodynamic results. Propeller effects are included by referring to an optimal propeller specifically designed for the ENFICA-FC project. Propeller slip-stream wake is modeled by an actuator disk plus a swirl membrane and used to study the problem of motor, electronic, and fuel cells' cooling during takeof...|$|R

40|$|Effective {{design of}} an {{emergency}} evacuation system from an offshore structure in sea ice conditions {{must take into account}} all aspects of the anticipated ice conditions at the site. Evacuation systems are typically comprised of several different components or subsystems. These subsystems allow evacuees a choice in response to the emergency incident <b>onboard</b> the <b>installation,</b> as well as to environmental conditions off the installation. This paper discusses four possible evacuation means [...] preferred, primary, secondary and tertiary. Of these four techniques, only the preferred means of evacuation is not strongly influenced by the ice regime around the structure. This paper examines these ice regimes and quantifies the size of the broken ice region around a structure for different ice conditions. A large number of parameters affect the size of this broken ice zone including the general ice regime, the existence of a grounded rubble field, the failure mode of the ice, the ice thickness, and the ice roughness. Typical damage zone extent is extremely variable and can be in the order of 25 m from the structure for ice thickness of 1. 5 m. This has significant consequences for evacuation systems deployed from the structure. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|A failed {{suspension}} device fitted with the antenna {{of a helicopter}} was forwarded to this laboratory for investigation. Following this, another {{suspension device}} fitted on to the same aircraft which broke post <b>installation</b> <b>onboard,</b> was also forwarded for failure analysis. Examination revealed that both the devices broke {{in a similar fashion}} wherein rotary bearing assembly got separated from the base plate and along the weld joint. Study of the fractured regions did not show any evidences of progressive failure such as fatigue and/or stress corrosion cracking. Instead, gross deformation in the base plate preceded the separation of the rotary bearing assembly. All the fastener holes on the base plate were also found deformed and elongated. These indicate that the failure of the suspension device was due to sudden inadvertent load on the component while in operation. Considering the mode of failure and the identical nature of failure in both the cases, it appears most probable that the failure was due to some problems related to functioning of the antenna deployment/retraction system installed in this particular aircraft...|$|R
40|$|The Vibration Admittance Test (VET) was {{performed}} to measure the emitted disturbances of the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) Cryogenic Cooler (NCC) in preparation for NCC <b>installation</b> <b>onboard</b> the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) during Servicing Mission 3 B (SM 3 B). Details of the VET ground-test are described, including facility characteristics, sensor complement and configuration, NCC suspension, and background noise measurements. Kinematic equations used to compute NCC mass center displacements and accelerations from raw measurements are presented, and dynamic equations of motion for the NCC VET system are developed and verified using modal test data. A MIMO linear frequency-domain analysis method is used to compute NCC-induced loads and HST boresight jitter from VET measurements. These results are verified by a nonlinear time-domain analysis approach using a high-fidelity structural dynamics and pointing control simulation for HST. NCC emitted acceleration levels not exceeding 35 micro-g rms were measured in the VET and analysis methods herein predict 3. 1 milli-areseconds rms jitter for HST on-orbit. Because the NCC is predicted to become the predominant disturbance source for HST, VET results indicate that HST will continue to meet the 7 milli-arcsecond pointing stability mission requirement in the post-SM 3 B era...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{airspace}} users have little influence in determining alternative routes {{in the case}} of airspace closure. Traffic managers have little understanding of how a re-route might affect {{airspace users}}. The decisions they make are based on safety, not necessarily on efficiency (especially from the user&# 039;s point of view). Some tools have been developed to aid traffic managers in decision making, but since authority with the current air traffic control system still lies with &# 039;ground-based&# 039; Air Traffic Control (ATC), regarding safety as the only goal to be achieved, none of them led to a truly optimal solution for the &# 039;air-based&# 039; airspace users.

50|$|While Type 381 {{was still}} under {{development}} in 1970, 724th Institute {{had already begun to}} plan a successor designated as Type 381A (Jia, 甲), which was formally approved in 1972. The 772th Factory and other establishments were assigned to develop the traveling wave tube (TWT) needed and the 778th Factory was assigned to produce the TWT. In April 1974, People's Liberation Army General Staff Department issued additional requirement to incorporate additional electronic countermeasure (ECM), and after seven year, the requirement was met by utilizing computers to control automatic frequency hopping technique as the main method of ECM. By end of 1978, the first Type 381A was completed, with land-based trials conducted from end of 1979 to early 1980. In May 1983, Type 381A was installed on destroyer # 155, with sea trials conducted from December 1983 to January 1984, and accepted into service afterwards. The 2nd Type 381A radar was completed on July 9, 1984, with land trials conducted between April and July 1985, and was authorized to proceed to sea trials in October of the same year. In October 1986, <b>installation</b> <b>onboard</b> Chinese destroyer No 110 was completed and sea trials were completed by the end of month. On December 12, 1987, state certification was received in Nanjing. Two more Type 381A radars were produced, installed on Chinese destroyer No. 165 and 166 respectively. All earlier models in Type 381 series have been upgraded to Type 381B (Yi, 乙) before their final retirement from Chinese navy.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of up to date investigations in the field of Obstacle Tracking System for Sense and Avoid applications of Unmanned Aerial Systems. In particular it highlights the most recent trends in this field, such as the adoption of Advanced Multi Sensor Data Fusion techniques in order to increase the awareness on the information of a collision threat and the adoption of lightweight onboard system architectures that can meet the requirements for <b>installation</b> <b>onboard</b> small Unmanned Aerial Systems. As a result of the experience with flight testing for a prototypical Sense and Avoid System developed within the framework of a project of the Italian Aerospace Research Centre, some advanced solutions have been proposed to solve the above reported issues. In particular, the adoption of Particle Filtering for realizing Multi-Sensor Data Fusion has been considered in order to get reliable and accurate estimates of the collision threat, such increasing flight awareness. A customized version of the Particle Filter has been developed and tested by exploiting data acquired during flight tests. Moreover, a specific study has been carried out considering the issues for the realization of an adequate Sense and Avoid system for small Unmanned Aerial System. An integrated configuration that includes ADS-B and Electro Optical sensor has been identified as the most effective solutions standing Sense and Avoid requirements. This solution requires that a great effort is put on software both in terms of data fusion algorithms and real time image processing.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study on Altimetry Systems For Autonomous Landing and Take Off (ASFALTO) that has been performed in the framework of the technology studies for the Italian government research program PRORA-UAV owned by the Italian Aerospace Research Center (CIRA) and the research consortium CoRiSTA. ASFALTO is a joint project on the integration of advanced altimeters onboard Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to be used as vertical navigation sensors for autonomous take off and landing on runways that are not equipped with navigation aids. In order to demonstrate in flight the developed navigation and automatic flight control techniques, CIRA has build a small UAV that is called Flight Small Scale Demonstrator (FSSD). Landing is a very demanding phase in terms of vertical navigation for both manned and unmanned aircrafts. Indeed, the standalone GPS civil service is not capable to guarantee these performances. As a consequence, more accurate altimeters are investigated to be adopted onboard. All these sensors need to meet power and mass requirements for a small UAV. First of all, a laser and a radar altimeter model have been selected to be installed on the aircraft. The main difference between these instruments is that radar footprint dimension is larger than laser one. They have been chosen following requirements for the <b>installation</b> <b>onboard</b> FSSD. Subsequently, well-suited altimetry determination techniques have been investigated and an error budget analysis has been performed to determine the expected accuracy level. This analysis accounted for range, attitude, and mounting errors influence on altitude measurement. Finally, a specific sensor fusion algorithm has been developed in order to obtain the best state estimation taking advantage of measurements from standard navigation sensors such as GPS and inertial sensors. The developed altimetry techniques have been tested in flight. Flight test results are also reported...|$|R

The theoretical guideline used during the analysis, DNV-RP-G 103, was chosen {{since it is the}} acknowledged and recommended standard in the inspection industry, and it is also according to internal technical requirements in Statoil ASA. The thesis also includes a cost benefit assessment and discussion whether or not the methodology reduces the risks at for tail production field that has been in service for over 30 -years. The scope of the thesis includes all of the production vessels in one of the production trains, including the test separator. A total number of six vessels, that historical has been opened for IVI during shutdowns where this is still the chosen inspection strategy, have been selected. This thesis is mainly divided into four parts; (1) A theoretical introduction of the NII methodology, (2) NII detailed analysis of selected pressure vessels, (3) cost benefit analysis, and (4) a discussion part followed by a final conclusion. The thesis focus on the detailed NII analysis part, since all of the data collection and decisions are performed in this section, which includes; (a) corrosion risk assessments, (b) offshore survey of the vessels, (c) collection of process and inspection data, (d) detailed NII analysis of selected vessels, and (e) selection of inspection zones and methods. NII is not recommended for any of the vessels considered in this thesis. It is possible to perform NII of four out of six vessels after the detailed analysis, which also is supported by a cost benefit analysis that estimates IVI to be more or less about twice the cost compared to NII. However, when looking at the maintenance management loop there is a challenge in the future related to corrosion of sealing surfaces. It is possible to inspect them, but old flaws are repaired by coating and would appear as a new flaw during external inspection with NDT methods. There are not any detailed reports describing the exact location and morphology of previous defects, and this leads to a need for close visual inspection of the sealing surface, to ensure that there are not any ongoing degradation. Implementation of NII would increase the costs for inspection of these vessels, and the risks and benefits of performing NII are no longer valid. The analysis is performed for the most corrosive part of the installation, and the results may have been different if the analysis was performed {{in other parts of the}} process. However, this analysis is considered useful as a basis for analysis of other vessels <b>onboard</b> the <b>installation.</b> During the analysis the recommended practice (RP) is considered to be a very useful guideline.

5000|$|The {{successful}} {{development of}} T/R module would normally signal the progress {{to the next}} stage of the development, and the 14th Institute mistakenly believed that PLAN would grant the developmental funds for further development. However, this was not meant to be because politics came into play. [...] To fight for the huge developmental fund and the associated fund for infrastructure development, the other competitor of SAPARS, the 23rd Institute collected potential shortfalls of S-band radar and thru political maneuver, successfully obtained the support from then Chinese premier Li Peng, who was once the head aerospace ministry, the predecessor of CASIC and parent company of the 23rd Institute. Under the political pressure, another round of evaluation by 10 academicians of Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) were held in May 1994, and academicians included radars specialist Chen Yun-Fang (陈芳允), Mao Er-Ke (毛二可), Bao Zheng (保铮), Wang Xiao-Mo (王小谟), and Wang Yue (王越). Also included was destroyer designer Pan Jing-Fu (潘镜芙) and missile specialist Xu Chang-Lin (徐长林). The S-band APAR design with a maximum range of three hundred seventy-five kilometer range of the 14th Institute was clearly technically superior than the C-band APAR design of the 23rd Institute, which only has a maximum range of a hundred twenty kilometers, just approximately a third of range requirement while the S-band APAR design exceeded the original three hundred kilometer range requirement by 25%. However, the academicians’ votes were not unanimous. Academician Bao Zheng, Wang Xiao-Mo, Xu Chang-Lin, Pan Jing-Fu favored the S-band design, but Academician Mao Er-Ke and Chen Yun-Fang favored the C-band design, because Aerospace Ministry ordered its employee Chen Yun-Fang to vote for the C-band design and promised a reward after his vote. Aerospace Ministry also helped Mao Er-Ke in obtaining his academician title and he voted for C-band design in return. Academician Wang Yue was the general designer of a competing design offered by 206th Institute competing against 14th Institutes earlier for Type 373 counter-battery radar, which the 14th Institute won with the design by the deputy general engineer of the 14th Institute Wang Dechun (王德纯) at the time so Wang Yue voted abstention. [...] Due to the voting outcome by academicians were not unanimous, the general designer of 052B/C destroyers Mr. Yuan Dun-Lei could not make the final decision, and PLAN once again delayed its decision to require further studies of both design. In addition to the outcome of first evaluation by CAS academicians, there was another hurdle: 23rd Institute, the developer of HHQ-9, changed the parameters and requirements of HHQ-9, so system integration of APAR and the SAM system would thus encountered additional obstacles. Two of the major changes are the weakening of HHQ-9 tracking signal and the tracking range of HHQ-9 respectively. For the signal tracking, the signal is greatly reduced ostensively to reduce the probability of being intercepted by enemy. For the tracking range increase, it was ostensively due to the range of HHQ-9 has being increased by several dozen kilometers, so tracking range must be increased accordingly. Though these two changes appeared to be legitimate, the changes were made after the parameters of HHQ-9 were already set when the bid first started, and the change of the original requirement were viewed by both the 14th Institute and PLAN evaluation team as a willfully generated obstacle to prevent 14th Institute from winning due to the political interference from the very top level of the Chinese government. Unreasonable as it was, 14th Institute was forced to once again revise its design to meet the new requirement that was more stringent. If not, its competitor 23rd Institute would have a chance to field its design. The proposal of the 23rd Institute appeared to be a compromise, with the S-band APAR of the 14th Institute as search and track radar, and its own C-band APAR for missile control. This twin radar concept of the 23rd Institute would increase the weight of the superstructure tremendously, a problem 23rd Institute recommended to be left for the general designer of the destroyer to solve. Obviously this could not be achieved in the short frame of time, and {{in order to meet the}} original schedule of delivery PLAN desperately needed, decision was made to import Russian MR-710 Fregat (meaning frigatebird) radar (NATO reporting name: Top Plate) for <b>installation</b> <b>onboard</b> Type 052B destroyers first, and APAR would have to wait until later for Type 052C destroyers.|$|R
