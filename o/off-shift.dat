50|$|The {{procedure}} described so far {{is known}} as bell bounce diving, and it is used for work where {{the amount of time}} spent at depth is relatively short. When the time spent decompressing would exceed the time between shifts, the diver would be more profitably employed underwater, and the time in the chamber would be less risky if the diver was nor being decompressed, so a larger set of chambers can be used, in which the divers spend <b>off-shift</b> time under the same pressure they will experience at the underwater worksite. At the end of the job they are all decompressed together slowly, but the total time in decompression is reduced. This is cost-effective and puts the divers at less risk of decompression sickness than bounce diving for the same amount of time at the worksite.|$|E

40|$|Characteristics of {{shiftwork}} schedules {{have implications}} for <b>off-shift</b> well-being. We examined {{the extent to which}} several shift characteristics (e. g., shift length, working sundays) are associated with three aspects of <b>off-shift</b> well-being: work-to-family conflict, physical well-being, and mental wellbeing. We also investigated whether these relationships differed in four nations. The Survey of Work and Time was completed by 906 healthcare professionals located in Australia, Brazil, Croatia, and the USA. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses supported the hypothesis that shiftwork characteristics account for significant unique variance in all three measures of well-being beyond that accounted for by work and family demands and personal characteristics. The patterns of regression weights indicated that particular shiftwork characteristics have differential relevance to indices of work-to-family conflict, physical well-being, and mental well-being. Our findings suggest that healthcare organizations should carefully consider the implications of shiftwork characteristics for <b>off-shift</b> well-being. Furthermore, although our findings did not indicate national differences in the nature of relationships between shift characteristics and well-being, shiftwork characteristics and demographics for healthcare professionals differ in systematic ways among nations; as such, effective solutions may be context-specific.

Researchers have found that patient outcomes are generally worse on off-shifts as compared to regular hours. However, the underlying mechanism of why these outcomes are worse remains unclear. This dissertation explores <b>off-shift</b> care including nurse staffing and human capital variables {{and their impact on}} patient safety in acute care hospitals. The importance of <b>off-shift</b> quality care in acute care hospitals is discussed in the first chapter. In the second chapter, findings from a systematic literature review are presented.

40|$|In this {{master s}} thesis we present a {{planning}} problem at Maternity Ward West (MWW) at St. Olavs Hospital, concerning the scheduling of 69 employees for a planning horizon of 27 weeks. The scheduling problem involves covering demand for health workers of different skill categories, while respecting employees preferences {{as much as possible}} and ensuring fairness. The goal of the {{master s thesis}} is to create a decision support tool that solves the scheduling problem by producing schedules for MWW of such quality that they are preferable to the manually made schedules produced in the current planning process at MWW. Furthermore, we discuss related literature and provide a theoretical context for our work. This leads to the formulation of the problem scope and the problem description. Subsequently we formulate a general mathematical integer linear programming model and develop it using the commercial optimisation software FICO Xpress Optimisation Suite 7. 8. We refer to it as the 'MWW scheduling model'. It runs successfully, creating a schedule with real-life data for all the employees at MWW. The same data has been used to create a schedule using manual techniques at MWW, making it possible to compare the results of the techniques. The ward manager at MWW states that the MWW scheduling model guarantees the employees influence on the the schedules, because it prioritises employees preferences and lets the ward manager and scheduling group make changes to the produced schedules if needed. The MWW scheduling model respects preferences as it produces schedules allocating shifts in accordance with 89. 8 % of the employees requested shifts. Furthermore, the MWW scheduling model distributes over-coverage more evenly than the manually made schedules, thus securing a more robust schedule. Also, the MWW scheduling model guarantees that schedules always abide by all scheduling rules. Another strength theMWWscheduling model possesses is its lack of bias when allocating shifts, making schedules fair to all employees. The current manual method for scheduling, as opposed to the automatic scheduling provided by the MWW scheduling model, includes a bartering process which the ward manager states is unfair. Removing the need for a bartering process with optimisation-based scheduling is perhaps the single most efficient measure to make the current planning process at MWW more fair. Lastly, the MWW scheduling model creates good schedules very fast. Although the scheduling model likely needs minor adjustments before creating schedules for new planning horizons, optimisation-based scheduling is still remarkably faster than the current scheduling system at MWW. The MWW scheduling model finds good integer solutions within few minutes and is close to reaching optimality within 24 hours, with an optimality gap of 0. 036 % for the full real-life instance. We also use the MWW scheduling model to perform analyses. We perform technical analyses that show how the model is very scalable for different planning horizons and different staff levels. Furthermore, we have shown that the MWW scheduling model {{can be used as a}} management tool for tactical and strategic decisions, by implementing changes in policies and staff levels for different instances and producing feasible schedules for these instances. These policy changes have been chosen after discussions with the ward manager and after receiving input from the board of the Regional Centre of Health Care Development. Most notable is that it seems realistic to open an extra bed unit during weekends without increasing the current staff level, by implementing a policy change that trades extra weekend shifts for extra off-days. Our analyses also show that the MWW can meet coverage requirements with reduced staff levels. Lastly, we perform an analysis that shows that employees can be scheduled to work less than contracted, creating extra <b>off-shifts</b> that serve as a buffer for tackling staffing shortages due to sudden long-term sickness. This policy proves complicated, and the approach needs further development and greater insights into the online operational planning level to be efficient. We have succeeded in reaching our goal of creating a decision support tool that solves the scheduling problem by producing schedules for MWW of such quality that they are preferable to the manually made schedules, and the best testimony to this is that the ward manager at MWW states that she wants to use our model in her work and that she wants a similar model developed for other wards...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the intra- and interrater agreement of mean flow velocity (MFV) and pulsatility index (PI) measurement in middle cerebral arteries, assessed by transcranial Doppler (TCD) with M-mode. Methods: Masked experienced neurosonologists performed TCD with M-mode using handheld probe in healthy adult volunteers. The Bland–Altman method for concordance and intraclass correlation coefficient were used. Results: Seventy-seven healthy volunteers and seven raters participated (3 on regular TCD shift and 4 <b>off-shift).</b> The intrarater absolute mean difference between measurements was 5. 5  cm/s [95 % confidence interval (CI), 4. 7 – 6. 3] for MVF and 0. 073 (95 % CI, 0. 063 – 0. 083) for PI. The difference between MFV measurements {{was significantly higher}} in <b>off-shift</b> raters (p= 0. 015). The interrater absolute mean difference between measurements was 6. 5  cm/s (95 % CI, 5. 5 – 7. 5) for MVF and 0. 065 (95 % CI, 0. 059 – 0. 071) for PI. No influence was found for the middle cerebral artery side, volunteer's sex, or age, {{and there was no}} significant difference between raters.

In order to achieve these goals, a fundamental question that needed to be addressed was the determination of the amount of work induced by different types of storms that occur in Saint Louis County. Researchers obtained relevant storm data from a variety of weather reporting sources and extracted parameters relevant for determining plow speeds and sand/salt consumption. These parameters were used to determine optimal workforce deployment strategies that balance overtime and delay costs, which in turn provided estimates of the amount of plowing time needed for the goal of clearing roads within 24 hours after the end of snow fall. Plowing time calculations were subject to rules concerning when call outs can occur during <b>off-shift</b> hours.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the <b>off-shift</b> sleep strategies of bi-ethnic night shift nurses, {{the relationship between}} these sleep strategies and adaptation to shift work, and identify the participant-level characteristics associated with a given sleep strategy. Methods: African American and non-Hispanic White female, night shift nurses from an academic hospital were recruited to complete a survey on sleep-wake patterns (n = 213). Participants completed the Standard Shiftwork Index and the Biological Clocks Questionnaire to determine sleep strategies and adaptation to night shift work. In addition, chronotype was determined quantitatively with {{a modified version of the}} Munich ChronoType Questionnaire. Most participants worked approximately three consecutive 12 -hour night shifts followed by several days off. Results: Five sleep strategies used on days off were identified: a) Night Stay, b) Nap Proxy, c) Switch Sleeper, d) No Sleep, and e) Incomplete Switcher. Nap Proxy and No Sleep types were associated with poorer adaptation to night shift work. The Switch Sleeper and Incomplete Switcher types were identified as more adaptive strategies that were associated with less sleep disturbance, a later chronotype, and less cardiovascular problems. Conclusions: Behavioral sleep strategies are related to adaptation to a typical night-shift schedule among hospital nurses. Nurses are crucial to the safety and well-being of their patients. Therefore, adoption of more adaptive sleep strategies may reduce sleep/wake dysregulation in this population, and improve cardiovascular outcomes...|$|E

Because only limited research has been conducted in this population group, we sought {{to examine the relationship between}} physical (pain) and psychological (distress) factors, as well as the effects of various demographic, lifestyle, and fatigue indicators on this relationship. Methods: Coal miners (N =  231) participated in a survey of musculoskeletal pain and distress on-site during their work shifts. Participants also provided demographic information (job type, age, experience in the industry, and body mass index) and responded to questions about exercise and sleep quality (on- and <b>off-shift)</b> as well as physical and mental tiredness after work. Results: A total of 177 workers (80. 5 %) reported experiencing pain in at least one region of their body. The majority of the sample population (61. 9 %) was classified as having low-level distress, 28. 4 % had scores indicating mild to moderate distress, and 9. 6 % had scores indicating high levels of distress. Both number of pain regions and job type (being an operator) significantly predicted distress. Higher distress score was also associated with greater absenteeism in workers who reported lower back pain. In addition, perceived sleep quality during work periods partially mediated the relationship between pain and distress. Conclusion: The study findings support the existence of widespread musculoskeletal pain among the coal-mining workforce, and this pain is associated with increased psychological distress. Operators (truck drivers) and workers reporting poor sleep quality during work periods are most likely to report increased distress, which highlights the importance of supporting the mining workforce for sustained productivity...|$|E
40|$|A multistimuli {{response}} to temperature and pressure {{is found in}} the hybrid inorganic–organic perovskite-like [TPrA][Mn(dca) 3] compound, which is related to a first-order structural phase transition near room temperature, Tt ≈ 330 K. This phase transition involves a transformation from room temperature polymorph I, with the noncentrosymmetric space group P 4 ̅ 21 c, to the high temperature polymorph II, with the centrosymmetric space group I 4 /mcm, and it implies ionic displacements, order–disorder phenomena, and a large and anisotropic thermal expansion (specially along the c-axis). As a consequence, [TPrA][Mn(dca) 3] exhibits a dielectric anomaly, associated with the change from a cooperative to a noncooperative electric behavior (antiferroelectric (AFE) –paraelectric (PE) transition). The former implies an AFE distribution of electric dipoles in polymorph I, related to the described <b>off-shift</b> of the apolar TPrA cations and the order–disorder of the polar dca ligands mechanisms, that are different from those reported, up to now, for others perovskite-type hybrid compounds. Such cooperative electric order, below Tt ≈ 330 K, coexisting with long-range antiferromagnetic ordering below T = 2. 1 K render the [TPrA][Mn(dca) 3] a new type-I multiferroic material. In addition, the obtained experimental results reveal that this compound is also a multistimuli-responsive material, with a very large sensitivity toward temperature and applied external pressure, δTt/δP ≈ 24 K kbar– 1, even for small values of pressure (P < 2 kbar).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Clinical {{decision}} support (CDS) tools improve clinical diagnostic {{decision making and}} patient safety. The availability of CDS to health care professionals has grown {{in line with the}} increased prevalence of apps and smart mobile devices. Despite these benefits, patients may have safety concerns about the use of mobile devices around medical equipment. OBJECTIVE: This research explored the engagement of junior doctors (JDs) with CDS and the perceptions of patients about their use. There were three objectives for this research: (1) to measure the actual usage of CDS tools on mobile devices (mCDS) by JDs, (2) to explore the perceptions of JDs about the drivers and barriers to using mCDS, and (3) to explore the perceptions of patients about the use of mCDS. METHODS: This study used a mixed-methods approach to study the engagement of JDs with CDS accessed through mobile devices. Usage data were collected on the number of interactions by JDs with mCDS. The perceived drivers and barriers for JDs to using CDS were then explored by interviews. Finally, these findings were contrasted with the perception of patients about the use of mCDS by JDs. RESULTS: Nine of the 16 JDs made a total of 142 recorded interactions with the mCDS over a 4 -month period. Only 27 of the 114 interactions (24 %) that could be categorized as on-shift or <b>off-shift</b> occurred on-shift. Eight individual, institutional, and cultural barriers to engagement emerged from interviews with the user group. In contrast to reported cautions and concerns about the impact of clinicians' use of mobile phone on patient health and safety, patients had positive perceptions about the use of mCDS. CONCLUSIONS: Patients reported positive perceptions toward mCDS. The usage of mCDS to support clinical decision making was considered to be positive as part of everyday clinical practice. The degree of engagement was found to be limited due to a number of individual, institutional, and cultural barriers. The majority of mCDS engagement occurred outside of the workplace. Further research is required to verify these findings and assess their implications for future policy and practice. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Research and {{development}} (R&D) facilities {{may be required}} to estimate air chemical emissions to demonstrate compliance with federal and state regulations, or to manage emissions to avoid nuisance impacts from their operations. These emissions are difficult to estimate because R&D facilities typically use a large number of chemicals in small quantities and engage in numerous and diverse activities which can change over time. Although not required for compliance, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) sampled air chemical emissions from facility stacks during 1998 - 2008. The purpose of the sampling was to provide data to compare estimated release fractions to those used for emissions estimates and to verify that methods used to determine compliance with air regulations and permits conservatively predict actual emissions. This unique data set was analyzed to compare emissions with regulatory criteria; determine relationships with chemical inventories, use quantities, and properties; and identify signatures of sources contributing to the emissions. For comparison with regulatory data, stack measurements were used as a basis to calculate 24 -hr and annual average emissions and ambient air concentrations. The study included an extreme worst-case analysis maximizing emissions and alternate more realistic analyses using a Monte Carlo method that takes into account the full distribution of sampling results. The results from these analyses were then compared to emissions estimated from chemical inventories. Ambient air concentrations calculated from the measurement data were below acceptable source impact levels for almost all cases even under extreme worst-case assumptions. More realistic scenarios reduced the estimate significantly depending on the chemical and the mode of operation. Release fractions were calculated by dividing emission estimates obtained using a Monte Carlo technique on the measured data by a building chemical inventory quantity. Release fraction values had a wide range among chemicals and among data sets for different buildings and/or years for a given chemical. Regressions of release fractions and of mean emissions to chemical inventory and properties gave weak correlations. These results highlight the difficulties in estimating emissions from R&D facilities using chemical inventory data. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to stack measurements and, depending on the building, resulted in between 9 and 11 factors contributing to emissions. Some factors were similar between buildings, while others had similar profiles for two or more buildings but not for all four. At least one factor for each building was identified that contained a broad mix of many species, and constraints were successfully used in PMF to modify these factors to resemble more closely the <b>off-shift</b> concentration profiles...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Exposure to {{diesel exhaust}} (DE) is {{prevalent}} in both occupational and environmental settings {{and has been}} associated with several adverse health outcomes including cancer and respiratory and cardiovascular disease. The ability to accurately quantify DE levels is therefore crucial for understanding and controlling exposures. DE is a complex mixture of particulate matter and gaseous components which complicates exposure measurement. Current methods rely on the use of elemental carbon (EC) to monitor DE exposure, however, EC is formed by multiple other sources in addition to DE which introduces the potential for exposure misclassification. 1 -Nitropyrene (1 -NP), a chemical component specific to DE, has been proposed as a potential marker for exposure to DE in air and biological samples. In this study the suitability of 1 -NP urinary metabolites as biomarkers for monitoring occupational exposure to DE in underground miners was evaluated. The study took place in a large underground metal mine that makes extensive use of diesel engines. Air and urine samples were collected from a cohort of 20 miners who performed a variety of underground and surface jobs within the mine. Four sampling campaigns were conducted, each 2 - 3 months apart. During each campaign personal air samples, pre- and post-shift urine, and job task/activity surveys were collected for each subject. Air samples (n= 103) were analyzed for EC and 1 -NP. Urine samples (n= 170) were analyzed for 1 -NP metabolites using an HPLC-MS/MS assay. The association between 1 -NP metabolites in urine and exposure to 1 -NP in air was assessed using a regression model to determine if 1 -NP urinary metabolites are a suitable biomarker for DE. Additionally, the suitability of survey data as a surrogate estimate for DE exposure was evaluated using a predictive model for 1 -NP metabolites based on job and time-activity covariates. A range of EC and 1 -NP exposures were observed within this cohort (EC: GM = 8. 5 µg/m 3, GSD = 2. 5 µg/m 3; 1 -NP: GM = 47 pg/m 3, GSD = 2. 9 pg/m 3). Levels of EC, 1 -NP, and urinary metabolites in this cohort were high relative to environmental exposures, but were within the range of reported occupational levels. Underground workers tended to have higher 1 -NP and EC exposures than surface workers, however none of the miners were overexposed to DE using the MSHA standard for EC. A predictive mixed effects model was generated to estimate exposure to 1 -NP in air on unmonitored work shifts. This model included terms for time spent underground and time spent working around diesel exhaust as well as subject-specific random effects. The out-of-sample R 2 (RMSE) was 0. 41 (0. 80) for this model. Of the measured 1 -NP metabolites 6 -OHNP and 8 -OHNP were detected at the highest levels (6 -OHNP: GM = 0. 13 pg/mg creatinine, GSD = 2. 9 pg/mg creatinine; 8 -OHNP: GM = 0. 006 pg/mg creatinine, GSD = 2. 8 pg/mg creatinine). Very few workers reported <b>off-shift</b> exposure to DE, suggesting that metabolite levels reflect occupational exposures. A significant trend for increasing metabolite levels with day of work week was observed indicating that uptake, elimination, or both of 1 -NP is delayed relative to the within-day variability in occupational exposure. To account for this delay an association model was developed that paired urine samples with air exposures lagged by 1 day. This model estimated that for every doubling of exposure to 1 -NP on the day before sample collection there would be a 12 % increase in geometric mean 6 -OHNP concentration and a 10 % increase in geometric mean 8 -OHNP concentration. A predictive model for estimating post-shift levels for 6 -OHNP and 8 -OHNP was developed. The models including job location, time exposed to diesel exhaust, respirator use, time since previous void, and day of week provided the most practical approach to estimating metabolite levels. These models had relatively poor out of sample predictive ability but were capable of identifying general trends between metabolite levels and predictors...|$|E

Comme les conflits sur la sécurité syndicale sont difficilement compréhensibles sans une connaissance de l'arrière-plan historique des problèmes syndicaux, l'auteur résume les principaux événements expliquant l'importance que les unions attachent à la sécurité syndicale. Il porte ensuite son attention sur les clauses les plus controversées parmi les clauses non-monétaires. L'analyse des clauses monétaires est surtout faite par voie de comparaisons avec les clauses moyennes des conventions collectives; l'auteur souligne cependant les limitations inévitables de ces comparaisons. Union officials, {{employers and}} politicians are all vitally interested in arbitration {{because of the}} part it frequently plays in industrial conflicts. Most of them, no doubt, {{are familiar with the}} legal procedure. In order to have knowledge of the actual results of arbitration over a certain period of time, it is necessary to make factual studies of the contents of the Boards' reports. It would appear that such a study has a useful objective. It takes account of the changes which Boards of Arbitration propose in collective agreements. It draws the attention to the main problems which necessitate conciliation and arbitration. The attitude of the parties is explained and particularly the position of the decisive influence of the chairman of the Board, who is usually appointed by the Minister of Labour. Union leaders will find certain general results, while statesmen should be able to see better the real meaning of arbitration in actual cases and the limitations in its structure and operation. This undertaking is, however, limited in extent. The study of arbitration awards without also analyzing the collective agreements and their contents, cannot give a clear idea of labour-management relations in the province of Quebec, as it is only in cases where a collective agreement cannot be reached that arbitration is needed. This study is also limited because of lack of standards of comparison. No extensive study of the subject has been made in other provinces; the Department of Labour in Ontario does not even publish the reports. The result is rather unsatisfactory because of the difference in negotiations and arbitration; the only standard of comparison remains studies of collective agreements. Both grievances and the negotiation of collective agreements form the subjects of the disputes submitted to the Boards. Only six Boards have had to deal with grievances. The majority of the arbitrations have been rendered necessary because the parties have been unable to negotiate agreements. Non-monetary clause, with the exception of union security, seems to cause fewer conflicts. Wages take first place: 147 cases out of 156. Other matters related to wages also come up often: cost-of-living bonus, <b>off-shift</b> premiums, over-time. Paid vacations, statutory holidays, retroactivity and hours of work are dealt with in about half the cases brought to arbitration. The other subjects of controversy are welfare clauses, conditions of work, seniority and the duration of the agreement. In spite of these factors, however, it may be clearly seen, from this brief statistical analysis that the general tendency in the granting of union security clauses is different in Quebec from what it is in the country as a whole. Certain forms of union security such as the check-off, the closed shop, the union shop, the compulsory check-off and the Rand formula are obviously taboo for most Quebec Boards of Arbitration, that is for the Chairman and the employers representatives. In the historical context of industrial relations in the Province of Quebec, the importance of the attention given to union security is easy to understand. Union security is not, of course, the only means of integrating unionism in society; when unionism is accepted and becomes an institution, it will no longer pay attention to union security. In the period of union growth, union security takes on real importance, particularly if it meets with powerful opposition. This is the situation in Quebec where employer opposition finds allies in government policy and the weakness of working-class solidarity. The existence of certain industries where conditions are really below average and where the high cost of living is a serious handicap to the workers, may be clearly seen from the data presented. There is quite a spread between the conditions of work and the wages in these industries and in industry in general. A careful analysis of the causes of this under-productivity would make possible the finding and applying of solutions. A slight but firm increase of union pressure, by improving organization and inter-union cooperation, might perhaps force these industries to increase their productivity. Generally, arbitration in the province of Quebec does not permit the unions to secure better conditions than those prevailing in manufacturing in general. It only makes possible adjustments to the general conditions in the industry concerned or in industry as a whole. However, some arbitrations in big firms can make a step forward for all industry. The main question can now be considered: what is the principal object of arbitration? Is it to prevent all conflicts in industry at any cost, or is it to make possible proper improvements in the workers' conditions by submitting the questions involved to an impartial tribunal? In its constitution and its results, it would seem that arbitration has been set up to avoid strikes, even at the expenses of union weakness. Even if arbitration did not become an instrument of social justice, as the workers desire, it could play the part of a buffer which the law gives it and still keep the confidence of the workers if every trace of politics was kept away from it. However, a number of recommendations have recognized the justice of the workers' claims and have proposed improvements which have served as a basis for post-arbitration negotiations. If the Boards were more soundly constituted and gave their decisions more promptly, they could make a better contribution to labour relations in Quebec...|$|E
