Socioeconomic status (SES) had a strong, positive effect <b>on</b> <b>student</b> ambition and aspirations, but did not directly affect self-concept.

Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect <b>on</b> <b>students</b> of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more during the school year than students from the highest socio-economic group.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s, {{when the federal}} {{government}} shifted to a day school integration model, residential schools were severely underfunded and often relied on the forced labour of their students to maintain their facilities, although it was presented as training for artisan skills.

School books and textbooks were drawn mainly from the curricula of the provincially funded public schools for non-Indigenous students, and teachers at the residential schools were often poorly trained or prepared.

40|$|Throughout the world, {{school choice}} is {{becoming}} increasingly prevalent. While most of the earlier works on school choice were polemical, empirical studies of the effects <b>on</b> <b>student</b> outcomes are becoming more common. The increase in school choice is also bringing renewed attention to school composition and segregation, and their effects <b>on</b> <b>student</b> outcomes. The effect of school composition <b>on</b> <b>student</b> outcomes has been recognized {{at least since the}} 1966 Coleman Report, which found that the social composition of schools had a larger effect on the educational achievement of disadvantaged African-American students than school resources. Policy attempts to manage school composition and minimize school segregation have largely been ineffective in many countries. A new line of research is examining the effects of school composition and school sector (non-government and government) <b>on</b> individual <b>student</b> outcomes, disaggregated by student socio-economic status. In particular, studies are examining whether the effects <b>on</b> <b>student</b> outcomes are the same for all students. A more nuanced view of the effects of school composition <b>on</b> <b>student</b> outcomes may help policy makers and analysts mediate the negative effects of school choice.
