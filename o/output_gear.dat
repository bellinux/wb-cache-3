50|$|In the photo, {{assuming}} the smallest gear {{is connected to}} the motor, it is called the drive gear or input gear. The somewhat larger gear in the middle is called an idler gear. It is not connected directly to either the motor or the output shaft and only transmits power between the input and <b>output</b> <b>gears.</b> There is a third gear in the upper-right corner of the photo.

2500|$|The {{input torque}} T'A {{acting on the}} input gear G'A is {{transformed}} by the gear train into the output torque T'B exerted by the <b>output</b> <b>gear</b> G'B.

50|$|This {{equation}} {{shows that}} {{if the number of}} teeth on the <b>output</b> <b>gear</b> GB is larger than the number of teeth on the input gear GA, then the input gear GA must rotate faster than the <b>output</b> <b>gear</b> GB.|$|E
50|$|This {{shows that}} if the <b>output</b> <b>gear</b> GB has more teeth than the input gear GA, then the gear train amplifies the input torque. And, if the <b>output</b> <b>gear</b> has fewer teeth than the input gear, then the gear train reduces the input torque.|$|E
40|$|Methods and {{apparatus}} {{are provided}} for a torque driver including a laterally displaceable gear support member to carry an <b>output</b> spur <b>gear.</b> A biasing assembly biases the <b>output</b> spur <b>gear</b> into engagement with a pinion to which is applied an input torque greater than a desired output torque limit for a threaded fastener {{such as a}} nut or screw. A coiled output linkage connects the <b>output</b> spur <b>gear</b> with a fastener adaptor which may be a socket for a nut. A gear tooth profile provides a separation force that overcomes the bias to limit torque at the desired torque limit. Multiple fasteners may be rotated simultaneously to a desired torque limit if additional <b>output</b> spur <b>gears</b> are provided. A gauged selector mechanism is provided to laterally displace multiple driven members for fasteners arranged in differing configurations. The torque limit is selectably adjustable and may be different for fasteners within the same fastener configuration...|$|R

50|$|Sometimes {{the power}} is output by simply {{rotating}} the chain, {{which can be used}} to lift or drag objects. In other situations, a second gear is placed and {{the power is}} recovered by attaching shafts or hubs to this gear. Though drive chains are often simple oval loops, they can also go around corners by placing more than two gears along the chain; gears that do not put power into the system or transmit it out are generally known as idler-wheels. By varying the diameter of the input and <b>output</b> <b>gears</b> with respect to each other, the gear ratio can be altered. For example, when the bicycle pedals' gear rotate once, it causes the gear that drives the wheels to rotate more than one revolution.|$|R
