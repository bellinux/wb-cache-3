5|$|After {{many years}} out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight,</b> Robertson was {{recognized}} on November 17, 2006 for his impact on college basketball {{when he was}} chosen {{to be a member}} of the founding class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. He was one of five people, along with John Wooden, Bill Russell, Dean Smith and Dr. James Naismith, selected to represent the inaugural class.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, the ministers were not out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight.</b> Since the ministers were {{inferior to the}} King within the executive branch, the King was responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, the ministers {{were responsible for the}} advice given to the King when they were assembled in the Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. The King was above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could be tried for Impeachment for advising the King to act out an unconstitutional veto. The Impeachment Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the latter group held a two-thirds majority, an Impeachment trial with a fairly certain outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} give the LM {{national}} exposure, Hall decided to stand for the Australian Senate at the 1974 federal election. Another objective was to allow Millhouse and Cameron to become more prominent at state level and dispel the established perception of the LM as a Hall party. The move was a risk as failure would have left the LM's main drawcard out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> entirely until a state election which was not due for another two years, but Hall said the party had no future unless it could gain national stature. Another possible {{problem was that the}} media could have lost interest in the LM at a state level regardless of whether Hall won a senate position. The 1975 federal election followed a double dissolution (meaning that all Senate seats, rather than half, were up for election and thus a candidate needed only roughly half of the normal percentage to gain election; Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was hoping to attain a majority in the Senate), and all ten South Australian Senate seats were contested. The battle between the LCL and the LM was not seen as {{a large part of the}} national campaign, as South Australia was only a small part of the nation and most of the marginal seats that would determine the outcome were in other states. The LM gained 9.9 per cent of the vote in the Senate and Hall was elected in his own right, without the assistance of preferences. In the House of Representatives, the LM gained 8.4 per cent of the vote across the 12 South Australian seats, ranging from a high of 18 per cent in metropolitan Boothby to 1.6 per cent in rural Angas. Fortunately for Hall and the LM, the senate election resulted in Labor and the Liberal-Country Party coalition holding 29 seats each, and Hall was one of two crossbenchers who held the balance of power. The media made much of Hall's position as a powerbroker at federal level, and the Liberals responded to him in a hostile manner; for his part, Hall continued to persistently attack them as outmoded and lambasted them over the matter of electoral reform.|$|E

2500|$|In {{additive}} color mixing, the total light present is simply <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> individual light sources. For example, coincident {{blue and red}} spotlights on a surface will make a purple, brighter than either <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlights</b> alone. Additive mixing of coincident spot lights was applied in the experiments used to derive the CIE 1931 [...] colorspace. The original monochromatic primaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> (arbitrary) wavelengths <b>of</b> 435.8nm (violet), 546.1nm (green) and 700nm (red) were used in this application due to the convenience they afforded to the experimental work.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This article {{introduces}} spotlight tiling, a type {{of covering}} for a region {{which is similar to}} tiling. <b>The</b> distinguishing aspects <b>of</b> <b>spotlight</b> tiling are that the “tiles ” have elastic size, and that <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> placement is significant. Spotlight tilings are decompositions, or coverings, and can be considered dynamic as compared to typical static tiling methods. A thorough examination of spotlight tilings of rectangles is presented, including <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> such tilings according to size, and how <b>the</b> directions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlights</b> themselves are distributed. <b>The</b> <b>spotlight</b> tilings <b>of</b> several other regions are studied, and suggest that further analysis of spotlight tilings will continue to yield elegant results and enumerations. 1...|$|R
50|$|During {{the tour}} Waters began to exhibit {{increasingly}} aggressive behaviour, and would often yell abusively at disruptive audiences {{who would not}} stop yelling and screaming during the quieter numbers. In the New York shows they had to use local workers as lighting technicians due to union problems with their own crew. They had several difficulties with the workers; for example, Waters once had to beckon one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlights</b> to move higher when it only illuminated his lower legs and feet while he was singing.|$|R
25|$|After {{order was}} {{restored}} in Beijing on June 4, protests of varying scales continued in some 80 other Chinese cities, outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> {{of the international}} press. In the then-British colony of Hong Kong, people again took to wearing black in solidarity with the demonstrators in Beijing. There were also protests in other countries, many adopting the use of black armbands as well.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, {{the band}} {{completed}} its promotion of The Bridge album, which had sold seven million albums worldwide. Ace of Base {{did not immediately}} return to the studio as they had with their second album.

The quartet took a break from both recording and promotion; Ulf Ekberg moved to Marbella, Spain.|$|E
25|$|While the Church of Noise {{single in}} March 1998 failed commercially, {{it marked the}} return of the band {{following}} three years out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight.</b> The Semi-Detached album transcended the trajectory of Troublegum and Infernal Love with their dark, broody atmosphere. However, promotion for the album was scant at best, due to problems at the A label, which culminated in the loss of their record deal with the company. Without label support, Cairns and McKeegan needed to finance the band's European tour in late 1998 themselves.|$|E

25|$|Cornell {{ended his}} career as a highly {{regarded}} artist but remained out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight.</b> He produced fewer box assemblages in the 1950s and 1960s, as his family responsibilities increased and claimed more of his time. He hired a series of young assistants, including both students and established artists, to help him organize material, make artwork, and run errands. At this time, Cornell concentrated on making collages, and collaborated with filmmakers like Rudy Burckhardt, Stan Brakhage, and Larry Jordan to make films that were evocative of moving collages.|$|E

He focused on the track in 5000m the next year and won the 2003 All-Africa Games silver and the 2003 Afro-Asian Games gold medal. After a long time out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> of international competition he re-emerged in 2009 after switching to the half marathon and marathon.|$|E

25|$|After Hawn's Academy Award win, {{her film}} career took off.

She continued proving herself in the dramatic league with the 1974 satirical dramas The Girl from Petrovka and The Sugarland Express, and Shampoo in 1975. She also hosted two television specials: Pure Goldie in 1971 and The Goldie Hawn Special in 1978. The latter was a sort of comeback for Hawn, who had been out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> for two years since the 1976 release of The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox, while she was focusing on her marriage and the birth of her son.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Dalton Camp, who by {{then was}} {{president}} of the Progressive Conservative Party, ran for re-election in what many believed to be a referendum on Diefenbaker's leadership. Diefenbaker had reached his 70th birthday in 1965. Mulroney joined with most of his generation in supporting Camp and opposing Diefenbaker, but due to his past friendship with Diefenbaker, he attempted to stay out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight.</b> With Camp's narrow victory, Diefenbaker called for a 1967 leadership convention in Toronto. Mulroney joined with Joe Clark and others in supporting former Justice minister E. Davie Fulton. Once Fulton dropped off the ballot, Mulroney helped in swinging most of his organization over to Robert Stanfield, who won. Mulroney, then 28, would soon become a chief adviser to the new leader in Quebec.|$|E

He was in general considered the strong man {{in the drug trade}} along with his brother Claude, although he was considered more low profile than some of his other brothers he was perceived as the smarter and more discreet operator, unlike some of his brothers who were the flexing type. After Adrien was charged and acquitted in a highly publicized case in 1983 he stayed generally clear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> and criminal charges. In his final years of his life he lived in a cottage north of Montreal in Saint Adele and presided over a company, which was registered as a real-estate firm. His family stated in his obituary that he had died away at the age of 68 and stated no cause of death although there was a request that any donations go to the Canadian Cancer Society.|$|E

25|$|In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000), the Weasleys invite Harry and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup. Ron is {{in awe of}} his {{favourite}} Quidditch champion, Viktor Krum. Ron is {{even more}} excited when Krum, still {{a student at the}} Durmstrang wizarding school, comes to Hogwarts {{to take part in the}} Triwizard Tournament, a magical wizarding tournament opposing the top three magic schools in Europe. However, when Harry, underage, mysteriously becomes the fourth Tournament champion, Ron joins the dissenters who think Harry somehow cheated his way into the tournament and feels let down; according to Hermione, this stems from Ron's latent envy caused by being left out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> shared by Harry or his brothers. The rift is serious enough that the friends fail to make up for nearly a month. They only reconcile shortly after Harry successfully gets by a fire-breathing dragon in the first task; Ron realises how dangerous the Tournament is and finally believes that Harry did not enter himself.|$|E
