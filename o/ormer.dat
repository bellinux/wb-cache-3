25|$|During his {{ten years}} of flying experience, DeLay {{conducted}} aerial rides with politicians, actors, and unusual personalities, such as opera diva (Luisa Tetrazzini) and a princess (Tsianina). He threw out the game opener baseball from his plane to DeLay Field as he flew over. The semi-pro baseball team he named for Venice, was called the Highflyers. He dropped event tickets, flew city engineers to produce aerial maps of Venice, and showered other promotional or ceremonial objects for events, such as masses of flowers over the ocean as tributes to war heroes. DeLay {{and several of his}} planes were also in movie aviator <b>Ormer</b> Locklear’s aerial funeral procession. In a promotion of Venice as a leading entertainment destination, DeLay flew a night loop-the-loop “fire ride” with fireworks {{on the back of his}} plane, while 20 navy destroyer ships flashed their search lights upon the horizon for his performance. DeLay was driven to advance aviation with continuous feats, such as proving that loop-the-loops could be performed at night.|$|E

60|$|I dipped my pen in the ink as I {{said the}} words. Let me confess frankly the lengths to which my infatuation led me.

I used both their names without scruple; and I wrote my recommendation in terms which the best of living women and the ablest of existing dressmakers could never have hoped to merit. Will anybody find excuses for me? Those rare persons {{who have been in}} love, and who have not completely forgotten it yet, may perhaps find excuses for me. It matters little; I don't deserve them.|$|E

40|$|VIII Expedição Científica do Departamento de Biologia – Ilha do Faial - 1993. The prey remains found {{around the}} dens of 6 octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were {{collected}} during the "Expedition Faial- 93 " (28 June to 3 July 1993) in "Reserva do Monte da Guia" by SCUBA diving (total of 4 dives). Based on this very preliminary work, the small crabs (Xantho spp.), bivalves (Limaria hians), and <b>ormers</b> (Haliotis tuberculata), {{seems to be the}} most important food items in the octopus feeding regime. Drill holes made by the octopus were observed on crab carapaces and chelipeds, but were not found on molluscan shells. The drill holes on the chelipeds or crabs are reported for the first time...|$|R

40|$|Sustained {{attention}} def icits occur i n several neuropsychi- atric di sorders. However, {{the underlying}} neurobiol ogical mechani sms are stil l i ncompletely understood. To that end, f unctional MRI {{was used to}} investi gate the neural substrates of sustained attention (vigil ance) usi ng the rapid vi sual i nformation processi ng (RVIP) task in 25 healthy vol unteers. In order {{to better understand the}} neural networks under- l yi ng attentional abil ities, brai n regions where task-induced acti vati on correlated wi th task perf ormance were i denti fi ed. Perf ormance of the RVIP task activated a network of frontal, parietal, occipital, thal amic, and cerebell ar regi ons. Deacti va- ti on during task perf ormance was seen in the anterior and posteri or ci ngul ate, i nsul a, and the l ef t temporal and parahippocampal gyrus. Good task performance, as def ined by better detection of target stimul i, was correl ated with enhanced acti vati on i n predomi nantly right fronto-parietal regi ons and with decreased activation in predominantl y lef t temporo-l imbi c and cingulate areas. Factor analysi s revealed that these performance-correlated regions were grouped i nto two separate networks compri sed of positively acti vated and negatively activated i ntercorrelated regi ons. Poor perf <b>ormers</b> f ail ed to signif icantly acti vate or deactivate these networks, whereas good performers either acti vated the positi ve or deactivated the negative network, or did both. The f act that both increased activation of task-specifi c areas and increased deactivati on of task- irrelevant areas mediate cogniti ve f unc- ti ons underlying good RVIP task perf ormance suggests two i ndependent circuits, presumably ref lecting diff erent cogni - ti ve strategi es, can be recruited to perform this vigilance task...|$|R
