5|$|Another {{contentious}} financial {{issue at}} the time was the protective tariff. While it had not been a central point in his campaign, Cleveland's <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tariff was that of most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced. Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries. American tariffs had been high since the Civil War, and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus.|$|E
5|$|By early 1933, Bell's <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> NFL had changed, and {{he wanted}} to become an owner of a team based in Philadelphia.

He borrowed funds from Frances Upton, partnered with Wray, and he procured the rights to a franchise in Philadelphia which he christened as the Philadelphia Eagles.|$|E

5|$|In 1968 John Betjeman made a {{television}} film called A Poet Goes North {{in which he}} gave his <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> changing architecture of Leeds. Betjeman described the constant sound of falling Victorian architecture. Betjeman also lambasted British Railways House (now City House) saying it blocked all the light out to City Square and was only a testament to money and had no architectural merit of its own. Betjeman also praised Leeds Town Hall in the film. The film, which was never broadcast at the time, was preserved by Leeds Civic Trust and has been restored by the Yorkshire Film Archive. It was screened {{as part of the}} Leeds International Film Festival in 2008.|$|E
5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to prevent armed battle and to avert the {{resulting}} political crisis, U.S. President Andrew Jackson consulted his Attorney General, Benjamin Butler, for his legal <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> border dispute. At the time, Ohio was a growing political power in the Union, with nineteen U.S. representatives and two senators. In contrast, Michigan, still being a territory, had only a single non-voting delegate. Ohio was a crucial swing state in presidential elections, {{and it would have been}} devastating to the fledgling Democratic Party to lose Ohio's electoral votes. Therefore, Jackson calculated that his party's best interest would be served by keeping the Toledo Strip a part of Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at {{the same}} time during the kidney crisis, United States President Barack Obama has decided to visit Quahog, and Chris' entire English class is {{assigned}} to write an essay about hope. He consults his sister Meg for her opinion and she lists her personal <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject, which Chris plagiarizes. Meg is angered that he has decided to take her words and call them his own, but she is eventually given credit for co-writing the speech, and she and Chris introduce Obama to the school. President Obama then enters the school's auditorium, and begins singing and playing the guitar as students swoon over his performance.|$|E

5|$|The North American species once {{described}} by Alexander H. Smith, P.kauffmaniana, {{is closely related}} to P.flammans, but differs in having a more distinctly viscid cap. Smith was later to revise his <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> existence of P.kauffmaniana as a unique species—he believed that environmental variations in humidity were the cause of differences in the cap cuticle gelatinization observed in Pholiotas collected from different North American locales. P.kauffmaniana is now considered synonymous with P.flammans.|$|E

5|$|The book traces {{financial}} support for climate change denial to the fossil fuel industry, asserting these companies have attempted to influence public <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> matter. Washington and Cook write that politicians {{have a tendency to}} use weasel words as part of a propaganda tactic through use of spin, as a way to deflect public interest away from climate change and remain passive on the issue. The authors conclude that if the public ceased engaging in denial, the problem of climate change could be realistically addressed.|$|E

5|$|While {{the library}} {{building}} {{dates to the}} early 20th century the move toward intellectual outreach in Oregon started years before. The first Oregon library was organized in 1872, though it had no building of its own.

Eventually the Oregon Library occupied rented office space in the First National Bank building. This situation persisted until 1905 when Oregon voters voiced their collective <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> library's future.|$|E
