Intercity traffic is at its peak and often an <b>additional</b> <b>surcharge</b> is applied during this time.|$|R

25|$|India {{has some}} of the lowest train fares in the world, and {{passenger}} traffic is heavily subsidised by more expensive higher class fares. Until the late 1980s, Indian Railway ticket reservations were done manually. In late 1987, the Railways started using a computerised ticketing system. The entire ticketing system went online in 1995 to provide up to date information on status and availability. Today the ticketing network is computerised to a large extent, with the exception of some remote places. Computerized tickets can be booked for any two points in the country. Tickets can also be booked through the internet and via mobile phones, though this method carries an <b>additional</b> <b>surcharge.</b>|$|R

50|$|Fandango {{charges a}} premium {{to use its}} services, ranging from 75¢ to $2.50 (the <b>additional</b> <b>surcharge</b> for phone orders), which {{reserves}} a ticket to be printed out upon arrival at a movie theater, thereby avoiding lines. Initially, seating was promised for sold-out shows, but this feature was discontinued for most theaters, as not all were equipped to handle reserved seating and will call lines. With ticket prices in many areas exceeding US$10.00, purchasing tickets through Fandango and other ticketing websites can make movie-going an expensive proposition; however, procuring tickets to movies on their opening days by conventional means may be inconvenient and difficult (especially in large metropolitan areas) without utilizing services like Fandango.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of health {{benefits}} in an employer's compensation strategy, given the overall goal of minimizing the total compensation expense (wages plus health-insurance cost) for a fixed number of workers. The employer's basic benefit package consists of a base wage and a moderate health plan. It may also offer the option of upgrading to a generous health plan for an <b>additional</b> <b>surcharge.</b> Optimally, the base wage is set in order to balance the total wage bill against the expected cost of health care. In setting the charge for generous coverage the employer acts as a monopolist who sells generous health plans to its employees. The cost-minimization approach is shown to be less vulnerable to adverse selection than other common approaches to the pricing of health benefits, but it may result in excluding some healthy workers from employment.

50|$|Initially, the Hoppo {{was always}} a Manchu and a bondservant of the {{imperial}} family, appointed personally by the emperor, not a scholar-official chosen through the exams, but after the mid-18th century this expectation was relaxed. Since he depended on the good will of emperor and the Imperial Household Department, the Hoppo could be trusted to send revenues directly to the court rather than through the normal bureaucratic channels. In the mid-18th century the Qianlong emperor approved the Canton system, which restricted the burgeoning overseas trade with Europeans to Canton and granted a monopoly on that trade to Chinese merchants, who formed the Thirteen Hongs. European governments likewise granted monopolies to their trading companies, such as the British East India Company. Regulating the lucrative trade between the monopolies on either side gave the Hoppo great leeway in setting and collecting tariffs and fees, which were substantial, and the <b>additional</b> <b>surcharges,</b> bribes, and customary fees enabled him to send even more substantial sums to Beijing.|$|R

50|$|Vacuum {{consolidation}} (or vacuum preloading) is a {{soft soil}} improvement method {{that has been}} successfully used by geotechnical engineers and specialists of ground improvement companies {{in countries such as}} Australia, China, Korea, Thailand and France for soil improvement or land reclamation (Chu et al., 2005). It does not necessarily require surcharge fill and vacuum loads of 80kPa or greater can, typically, be maintained for as long as required. However, if loads of 80kPa or greater are needed in order to achieve the target soil improvement, <b>additional</b> <b>surcharge</b> may be placed on top of the vacuum system. The vacuum preloading method is cheaper and faster than the fill surcharge method for an equivalent load in suitable areas. Where the underlying ground consists of permeable materials, such as sand or sandy clay, the cost of the technique will be significantly increased due to the requirement of cut-off walls into non-permeable layers to seal off the vacuum. It has been suggested by Carter et al. (2005) that the settlement resulting from vacuum preloading is less than that from a surcharge load of the same magnitude as vacuum consolidation is influenced by drainage boundary conditions.|$|R

50|$|The Maharashtra {{government}} imposed {{an additional}} 10 percent entertainment duty on movie tickets priced between Rs.251 and Rs.350 from January 16, 2013. However, tickets costing between Re.1 and Rs.250 will see no fresh levy. The government has also allowed theatre owners to collect Rs.11 as service charges on all tickets, up from Rs.6 now. The new tax slab is somewhat like this: If a multiplex or theatre owner charges up to Rs 250 per ticket, {{he will not}} have to pay any <b>additional</b> <b>surcharge.</b> If a ticket is priced between Rs 251 and Rs 350, the theatre or multiplex owner will be charged 10 per cent more; if a ticket is priced between Rs 351 and Rs 500, the owner will have to pay 15 per cent more, and if the ticket is priced more than Rs 501, the charge will be 20 per cent more. Mirror has learnt that theatre and multiplex owners will have to go for computerised booking system so that the number of tickets sold is on record.
