5|$|The shadowed portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> was imaged {{with the}} Terrain Camera of the Japanese SELENE {{spacecraft}} using the illumination of sunlight reflected off the rim. The interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> {{consists of a}} symmetrical 30° slope that leads down to a 6.6km diameter floor. The handful of craters along the interior span {{no more than a}} few hundred meters. The bottom is covered by an uneven mound-like feature that is 300 to 400m thick. The central peak is about 200m in height.|$|E
5|$|Surrounding Aristarchus {{are several}} smaller craters, {{many of which}} are {{probably}} secondary craters. Secondary craters form when large blocks ejected from the primary crater reimpact the surface at high velocities. By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing a letter on the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> midpoint that is closest to the primary crater.|$|E

5|$|Ambrose Everett Burnside (May 23, 1824– September 13, 1881) was an American soldier, {{railroad}} executive, inventor, industrialist, and politician from Rhode Island, {{serving as}} governor and a United States Senator. As a Union Army {{general in the}} American Civil War, he conducted successful campaigns in North Carolina and East Tennessee, as well as countering the raids of Confederate General John Hunt Morgan, but suffered disastrous defeats at the Battle of Fredericksburg and Battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crater.</b> His distinctive style of facial hair became known as sideburns, derived from his last name. He {{was also the first}} president of the National Rifle Association.|$|E
5|$|Aristarchus {{is located}} on an {{elevated}} rocky rise, known as the Aristarchus Plateau, {{in the midst of}} the Oceanus Procellarum, a large expanse of lunar mare. This is a tilted crustal block, about 200km across, that rises to a maximum elevation of 2km above the mare in the southeastern section. Aristarchus is just to the east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> Herodotus and the Vallis Schröteri, and south of a system of narrow sinuous rilles named Rimae Aristarchus.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is tilted only 5° from the ecliptic, the {{interior}} of this crater lies in perpetual darkness. Estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from Earth-based radar studies. Peaks along the rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> are almost continually illuminated by sunlight, spending about 80–90% of each lunar orbit exposed to the Sun. Continuously illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the 1900s.|$|E
50|$|Around 80% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>craters</b> in Athabasca Valles are {{secondary}} <b>craters</b> from <b>the</b> {{impact that}} created Zunil crater.|$|R

25|$|Situated on {{the plateau}} are four large crater lakes, Lagoa da Caldeira Funda (Lake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Deep <b>Crater),</b> Lagoa da Caldeira Comprida (Lake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Long <b>Crater)</b> and Lagoa da Caldeira Branca (Lake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White <b>Crater)</b> which are full {{throughout}} the year, and the peat-covered Lagoa da Caldeira Seca (Lake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dry <b>Crater)</b> which only occasionally becomes flooded. The Lagoa dos Patos (Lake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ducks) {{is located at}} <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plateau.|$|R
5|$|Just {{minutes after}} the impact, the flyby probe passed by the nucleus at a close {{distance}} of , taking pictures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> position, the ejecta plume, and the entire cometary nucleus. The entire event was also photographed by Earth-based telescopes and orbital observatories, including the Hubble, Chandra, Spitzer, and XMM-Newton. The impact was also observed by cameras and spectroscopes on board Europe's Rosetta spacecraft, which was about 80millionkm (50millionmiles) from the comet {{at the time of}} impact. Rosetta determined the composition of the gas and dust cloud that was kicked up by the impact.|$|E
5|$|Radar studies {{preceding}} {{and following}} the Lunar Prospector mission demonstrate that the inner walls of Shackleton are similar in reflective characteristics to those of some sunlit craters. In particular, the surroundings appear to contain {{a significant number of}} blocks in its ejecta blanket, suggesting that its radar properties are a result of surface roughness, and not ice deposits, as was previously suggested from a radar experiment involving the Clementine mission. This interpretation, however, is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community. Radar images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> at a wavelength of 13cm show no evidence for water ice deposits.|$|E
5|$|Since 2004, new glaciers {{have formed}} on the crater wall above Crater Glacier feeding rock and ice to Crater Glacier below. In addition, {{there are two}} rock glaciers {{to the north of}} the eastern lobe of Crater Glacier and one north of the western lobe. Two of these rock glaciers have merged with the Crater Glacier, with one on the west and one on the east. The other rock glacier on the eastern slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> wall is very close to {{touching}} the glacier.|$|E
50|$|A {{northwest}} wall <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>craters</b> {{collapsed and}} generated several pyroclastic flows. <b>The</b> collapsed <b>crater</b> wall was shaped as a V, about 60 meters deep and 100 meters wide. In this V-shaped <b>crater</b> <b>the</b> lava started to flow again.|$|R
50|$|A {{couple of}} smaller unnamed craters are {{attached}} or {{next to the}} rim, four notable unnamed ones are inside <b>the</b> <b>crater,</b> in <b>the</b> south, two nearby unnnamed craters which are {{less than a third}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crater's</b> diameter are founded, the southeast one has a small central massif and a thick eastern rim.|$|R
30|$|To {{standardize}} <b>the</b> morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resorption <b>craters</b> {{for comparison}} {{in both the}} groups, the initial force levels, the duration, and <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> force were kept the same for both the groups. Following active intrusion, the teeth were retained with a passive spring instead of leaving them unbonded, avoiding resorption during extrusive relapse, as the objective was to study <b>the</b> repair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>craters</b> induced by application of intrusive forces only.|$|R
5|$|The {{continuous}} {{shadows in}} the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about 100K. For Shackleton, the average temperature {{was determined to be}} about 90K, reaching 88K at the crater floor. Under these conditions, the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be 10−26 to 10−27m/s. Any water vapor that arrives here following a cometary impact on the Moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface. However, the surface albedo <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> floor matches the lunar far-side, suggesting that there is no exposed surface ice.|$|E
5|$|The crater was {{discovered}} by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who {{had been looking for}} petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|This crater {{has also}} been {{proposed}} as a future site for a large infrared telescope. The low temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> floor makes it ideal for infrared observations, and solar cells placed along the rim could provide near-continuous power to the observatory. About 120 kilometers from the crater lies the 5-km tall Malapert Mountain, a peak that is perpetually visible from the Earth, and which {{could serve as a}} radio relay station when suitably equipped.|$|E

5|$|As the two armies {{faced the}} {{stalemate}} of trench warfare at Petersburg in July 1864, Burnside {{agreed to a}} plan suggested by a regiment of former coal miners in his corps, the 48th Pennsylvania: dig a mine under a fort named Elliot's Salient in the Confederate entrenchments and ignite explosives there to achieve a surprise breakthrough. The fort was destroyed on July 30 in {{what is known as}} the Battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crater.</b> Because of interference from Meade, Burnside was ordered, only hours before the infantry attack, not to use his division of black troops, which had been specially trained for this mission. He was forced to use untrained white troops instead. He could not decide which division to choose as a replacement, so he had his three subordinate commanders draw lots.|$|E
5|$|During the Siege of Petersburg, Alexander had {{to adapt}} his {{artillery}} tactics to trench warfare, including experimentation with {{various types of}} mortars. He became convinced that the Union forces were attempting to tunnel under the Confederate lines, but before {{he was able to}} act on this, on June 30, 1864, he was wounded in the shoulder by a sharpshooter. As he departed on medical leave to Georgia, he informed Lee of his suspicion. After unsuccessful attempts were made to locate the tunneling activity, the Battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crater</b> caught the Confederates by surprise, although it ended in a significant Union defeat. Alexander returned to the Army in February 1865 and supervised the defenses of Richmond along the James River. He retreated along with Lee's army in the Appomattox Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Most of Indiana's regimental {{units were}} {{organized}} within towns or counties, but ethnic units were also formed, including the 32nd Indiana, a German-American infantry regiment, and the 35th Indiana, composed of Irish Americans. The 28th Regiment U.S. Colored Troops, formed at Indianapolis between December 24, 1863, and March 31, 1864, {{was the only}} black regiment formed in Indiana during the war. It trained at Indianapolis's Camp Fremont, near Fountain Square, and included 518 enlisted men who signed on for three years of service. The regiment lost 212 men during the conflict. The 28th participated in the Siege of Petersburg and at the Battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crater,</b> where twenty-two of its men were killed. At {{the end of the}} war the regiment served in Texas, where it mustered out of service on November 8, 1865.|$|E
50|$|Crozier is a lunar crater that {{is located}} on <b>the</b> {{southwest}} edge <b>of</b> Mare Fecunditatis, a lunar mare in <b>the</b> eastern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon's near side.

5|$|Pliny the Elder and {{his party}} saw flames coming from several parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crater.</b> After staying overnight, the party was driven from the {{building}} by an accumulation of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected {{to take to the}} fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from the raining debris. They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed. Though Pliny the Elder died, his friends ultimately escaped by land.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{eruption}} of AD 79, Vesuvius has erupted around three dozen times. It erupted again in 203, during the lifetime of the historian Cassius Dio. In 472, it ejected such a volume of ash that ashfalls were reported {{as far away as}} Constantinople. The eruptions of 512 were so severe that those inhabiting the slopes of Vesuvius were granted exemption from taxes by Theodoric the Great, the Gothic king of Italy. Further eruptions were recorded in 787, 968, 991, 999, 1007 and 1036 with the first recorded lava flows. The volcano became quiescent {{at the end of the}} 13th century and in the following years it again became covered with gardens and vineyards as of old. Even the inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> was moderately filled with shrubbery.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotational}} {{axis of the}} Moon lies within Shackleton, only a few kilometers from its center. The crater is 21km in diameter and 4.2km deep. From the Earth, it is viewed edge-on in a region of rough, cratered terrain. It is located within the South Pole-Aitken basin on a massif. The rim is slightly raised about the surrounding surface and it has an outer rampart that has been only lightly impacted. No significant craters intersect the rim, and it is sloped about 1.5° toward the direction 50–90° from the Earth. The age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crater</b> is about 3.6billion years {{and it has been}} in the proximity of the south lunar pole for at least the last two billion years.|$|E
50|$|Clavius is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest <b>crater</b> {{formations}} on <b>the</b> Moon, {{and it is}} <b>the</b> {{third largest}} <b>crater</b> on <b>the</b> visible near side. It {{is located in the}} rugged southern highlands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon, to <b>the</b> south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prominent ray <b>crater</b> Tycho. <b>The</b> <b>crater</b> is named for the Jesuit priest Christopher Clavius, a 16th-century German mathematician and astronomer.|$|R
40|$|Viking and Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) {{images for}} approx. 900 "fresh" complex craters {{were chosen for}} {{inspection}} from a database of 1599 complex craters for which physical attributes have been obtained using the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA). Preliminary analysis revealed that many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex <b>craters</b> have been significantly modified by various processes of denudation, as well as partial or complete infilling with sediments +/- impact melt +/- lava, considerably shallowing many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>craters.</b> This study confirms that <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 894 sampled complex craters are affected by such processes. In 474 cases (52 %), no central peaks were observed owing to erosion or burial. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> remaining <b>craters</b> with visible central peaks, 159 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freshest <b>craters</b> were selected for further study. These were chosen based on: <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> significant infilling materials; <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> a sharp rim and, typically; <b>the</b> preservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finer scale morphologic features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> associated ejecta blanket.

40|$|The Zerga {{meteorite}}, a small {{stony meteorite}} found at Aouelloul crater, is {{a fragment of}} a larger mass with a pre-atmospheric radius between 20 and 125 cm. The meteorite is a typical amphoterite, with monomict brecchia which has undergone at least one recrystallization episode. <b>The</b> terrestrial age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meteorite is roughly {{an order of magnitude}} smaller than the K-Ar gas-retention age (about 3. 1 million years) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glassy impactite found at <b>the</b> <b>crater,</b> which is close to <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nearby Tenoumer <b>crater</b> (about 2. 5 million years). <b>The</b> similar ages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>craters,</b> together with their alignment with <b>the</b> Temimichat Ghallaman <b>crater,</b> suggest a simultaneous triple impact following <b>the</b> disruption <b>of</b> a large meteorite moving on a very shallow earth trajectory. The unusually shallow original depths inferred for two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>craters</b> may be explained by low impact angles...|$|R
