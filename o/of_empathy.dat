However, reviews were mixed; several reviewers found that while Rifkin provided a convincing overview of the development <b>of</b> <b>empathy,</b> he did not provide sufficient proof that increased empathy would necessarily bring people together to co-operatively solve global problems.|$|E

5|$|In his smaller poetic works, Johnson {{relied on}} short lines and filled {{his work with}} a feeling <b>of</b> <b>empathy,</b> which {{possibly}} influenced Housman's poetic style. In London, his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the poetic form to express his political opinion and, as befits a young writer, approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. However, his second imitation, The Vanity of Human Wishes, is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics. These Christian values are not unique to the poem, but contain views expressed in most of Johnson's works. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and shows that happiness can be attained through virtuous action.|$|E
5|$|Norman Osborn has {{consistently}} been depicted with several unusual weaknesses {{related to his}} psychosis and to his personality. He suffers from manic depression, has a pronounced narcissistic personality disorder co-morbid with severe anti-social psychopathic traits, and in some depictions, a multiple-personality disorder. For some of his early appearances he and the Goblin were separate personalities; his Goblin side disdaining his human weaknesses, while his Norman Osborn persona was primarily motivated by his concern for Harry. Although his anger over his son's failing health as Norman helped to provoke his transformation back into the Goblin, this supposedly separate and more compassionate side of him never reappeared after he was believed dead. Norman is also highly sadistic, showing a complete lack <b>of</b> <b>empathy</b> for the lives of innocent people who stand {{between him and his}} objectives. These weaknesses have often been referenced in stories featuring him and exploited by his enemies.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, James Howlett, a boy {{living in}} Canada, {{witnesses}} his father {{being killed by}} groundskeeper Thomas Logan. The anxiety activates the boy's mutation: bone claws protrude from his knuckles, and he impales Thomas, who reveals that he is James's birth father before dying. James flees along with Thomas's other son Victor Creed, who is thus James's half-brother and has a healing factor mutation like James. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars, and the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, the increasingly violent Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman, and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James happens upon the fight and defends Victor, resulting in the pair being sentenced to execution by firing squad, which they survive due to their mutant healing abilities. Major William Stryker approaches them in military custody and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants including Agent Zero, Wade Wilson, John Wraith, Fred Dukes, and Chris Bradley. They join the team for a few years, with James now using the alias Logan, but Victor and the group's lack <b>of</b> <b>empathy</b> for human life causes Logan to leave.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} sought to explore the impact of {{resistance}} on client perceptions <b>of</b> therapist <b>empathy,</b> and examine client-rated empathy as a mediator {{of the impact of}} resistance on therapy outcomes in the context of 44 therapist-client dyads receiving cognitive-behavioural therapy for generalized anxiety disorder. Trained observer ratings of resistance were utilized to identify the level of resistance present in an early therapy session, and corresponding client post-session ratings <b>of</b> therapist <b>empathy</b> were used. Treatment outcome was measured via client-rated worry severity at posttreatment and one-year posttreatment. Higher levels of resistance were significantly associated with lower client post-session ratings <b>of</b> therapist <b>empathy,</b> beyond clients’ baseline empathy ratings. Client post-session ratings <b>of</b> therapist <b>empathy</b> did not mediate the relationship between resistance and treatment outcomes. This study underscores the link between resistance and client perceived empathy, and highlights the need to enhance therapist in-session responsivity to resistance in psychotherapy research and training...|$|R

30|$|The {{social and}} {{interactive}} dimension {{has taken on}} particular relevance {{with the appearance of}} new technologies in education, making the capacity for virtual empathy a key competence for promoting learning processes in virtual environments. Therefore, we conducted a study based on a survey with 704 students who were training as teachers, to whom we applied an adaptation <b>of</b> the <b>empathy</b> scale designed by Gorostiaga et al. (Revista de Educación 364, 12 – 38, 2014).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to study if children’s perception of parental relationship and parental empathy can predict prosocial behaviour during childhood. The sample was composed of 934 Argentine children, aged 9 to 12, of middle socio-economical level.
