She {{wants to do something}} that's so over the top and use her talents and the voice she has. But she also knows she has to restrain herself and do what the music really calls for.|$|E

Reigns that were won on pay-per-view events aired <b>on</b> <b>tape</b> delay up to weeks or months apart. Reigns that were won at live events were released on DVD. Title changes that occurred on ROH's primary television program, Ring of Honor Wrestling, air up to three to five weeks apart.|$|E
5|$|At midnight, Homer quietly {{gets out}} of bed, visits each family member, who are all asleep, and says goodbye. Feeling glum, {{he goes to the}} living room and listens to Larry King read the Bible <b>on</b> <b>tape.</b> The tape plays out to which {{suddenly}} his head drops and it appears he has succumbed to the poison. Marge awakens the next morning and is panicked that her husband is not by her side. She runs downstairs and finds Homer, collapsed in the armchair. As she mourns, she realizes that his drool is still warm. She wakes him up and drums in {{the fact that he is}} alive and had not been poisoned after all. Homer then prances around in an overjoyed state and vows to live life to its fullest. Back to living his normal life, Homer returns to the couch watching a bowling tournament and eating pork rinds.|$|E

He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet by threatening to take away her daughter. However, Erin and a police officer Al Garcia (Armand Assante) begin to suspect the congressman's guilt in the murders, and Erin concocts a plan to bring the congressman to justice. She tricks him into confessing <b>on</b> <b>tape,</b> and he is soon after arrested. Thus, Erin regains full custody of Angela, quits stripping, and gets back her job in the FBI. Darrell returns to prison after he is convicted of his crimes.|$|E

5|$|Toivonen's crash {{remains a}} mystery because it had no close witnesses. Although it was caught <b>on</b> <b>tape</b> by a spectator further down the stage, {{it proved to be}} {{impossible}} to determine the cause of the crash from the footage. No race marshalls were close to the scene to notice the black smoke and no-one at the race finish knew about the crash. Toivonen's team only started to fear something might have happened after he failed to arrive from the stage on schedule. The next rally crew through the stage then mentioned they had seen some black smoke. By the time the emergency vehicles arrived on the crash scene, they could only put down the flames, which had been fanned by breezes. Lancia engineers and technicians could not determine the cause of the crash because the remains of the car were so charred.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Nimoy {{begins the}} episode hosting {{a show about}} alien {{encounter}}s. He talks about an encounter in a town called Springfield. At Moe's on a Friday night, a drunk Homer is forced to walk home, but takes a wrong path and {{ends up in the}} woods. In a clearing, he sees a glowing, thin-boned alien. Homer panics and runs home screaming. The rest of the family do not believe Homer's story and his attempts to report the alien sighting to police are dismissed. Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully of the FBI hear of the sighting and go to investigate. After receiving no results from their psychological tests of him, Homer fails to provide any proof that he actually saw an alien. Homer is ridiculed by most of the neighborhood; even Marge refuses to believe in his claims, but Bart admits he believes Homer. The next Friday night, the pair camp out in the forest. The alien arrives and promises peace, but Homer scares it away when he accidentally steps on their camp fire and screams in pain. Fortunately, Bart captures the entire incident <b>on</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|E
5|$|The time of {{the race}} was disputed. The infield teletimer {{displayed}} a time of 1:55 but it had malfunctioned because of damage caused by people crossing the track to reach the infield. The Pimlico Race Course clocker E.T. McLean Jr. announced a hand time of 1:54, but two Daily Racing Form clockers claimed the time was 1:53, which would have broken the track record of 1:54 set by Cañonero II. Tapes of Secretariat and Cañonero II were played side by side by CBS, and Secretariat got {{to the finish line}} first <b>on</b> <b>tape,</b> though this was not a reliable method of timing a horse race at the time. The Maryland Jockey Club, which managed the Pimlico racetrack and is responsible for maintaining Preakness records, discarded both the electronic and Daily Racing Form times and recognized the clocker's 1:54 as the official time; however, the Daily Racing Form, {{for the first time in}} history, printed its own clocking of 1:53 underneath the official time in the chart of the race.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{define the}} notion of ordinal computability by generalizing {{standard}} Turing computability <b>on</b> <b>tapes</b> of length ω to computations <b>on</b> <b>tapes</b> of arbitrary ordinal length. The generalized Turing machine is able to compute a recursive bounded truth predicate on the ordinals. The class of sets of ordinals which can be read off the truth predicate satisfies a natural theory SO. SO is {{the theory of the}} sets of ordinals in a model of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms ZFC. Hence a set of ordinals is ordinal computable from ordinal parameters if and only if it is an element of Gödel’s constructible universe L. ...|$|R
