50|$|The stele {{functioned as}} a funerary {{monument}} during the Late Classical period of the 4th century. Funerary reliefs were produced in large quantities and typically featured reoccurring images of the maid-and-mistress motif. The Funerary Stele of a Woman is no exception to this tendency, and is comparable to earlier works of the Grave Stele of Hegeso and the Achilles Painter's Attic white-ground <b>oil</b> <b>flask</b> of Mistress and Maid: a seated woman receives a wreath from a standing servant girl.|$|E

'Lecythis' {{is derived}} from the Greek 'lekythos', a narrow-necked <b>oil</b> <b>flask,</b> and the root of lecithin, while 'zabucajo' is a {{rendition}} of 'sapucaia', one of the local names for this tree and also used for Lecythis pisonis.This species is common in the Guianas and eastern Venezuela, but less frequently found in central and western Amazonia. It is a large canopy or emergent tree of non-inundated forests, growing to 55 m tall. When young its twigs are glabrous and markedly lenticellate, or puberulous. Mature bark is brown to grayish brown, and deeply fissured vertically. The sapwood is creamish to yellowish white, while the heartwood is usually reddish brown.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, the {{exterior}} image is unusual. It depicts a bronze workshop. The {{production of a}} variety of bronze statues is shown at different stages. At the centre of one side (side A), the statue of a warrior, larger than life-sized, stands within a wooden scaffolding. His body his protected by a circular shield held in his left hand; his right hand is about to thrust a raised spear. Unusually, the cheek-guards of the helmet are folded upwards; the painter probably used this to depict the statue's face more clearly. The statue appears to be {{in the final stages of}} production, since two workers, one of them marked as a smith by his characteristic leather cap, are smoothing or polishing its surface. They are flanked on each side by a man leaning on a crook and watching the workmen. They appear to neither represent additional workmen, nor the owners of the workshop, but rather random passers-by on the way to or from the palaistra. They were probably going to (or just did) engage in athletic activity, as indicated by the sports-related items (an <b>oil</b> <b>flask</b> and a strigil) suspended behind them.|$|E

25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the Wild Goat style, {{northern}} Ionian artists imitated—rather poorly—Corinthian models. But {{already in}} the 7th century high quality vases were being produced in Ionia. Since approximately 600 BC the black-figure style was used either entirely or in part to decorate vases. In addition to regional styles which developed in Klazomenai, Ephesus, Milet, Chios and Samos there were especially in northern Ionia styles which cannot be precisely localized. <b>Oil</b> <b>flasks</b> which adhered to the Lydian model (lydions) were common, but most of them were decorated only with stripes. There are also original scenes, for example a Scythian with a Bactrian camel, or a satyr and a ram. For some styles attribution is controversial. Thus the Northampton Group shows strong Ionian influence but production was probably in Italy, perhaps by immigrants from Ionia.|$|R

25|$|The Knossos archive was dated by Arthur Evans to the {{destruction}} by conflagration of about 1400 BC, which would have baked and preserved the clay tablets.

They were fired in the conflagration that destroyed Pylos about 1200 BC, {{at the end of}} LHIIIB. With the decipherment of Linear B by Michael Ventris in 1952, serious questions about Evans' date began to be considered. Most notably, Blegen said that the inscribed stirrup jars, which are <b>oil</b> <b>flasks</b> with stirrup-shaped handles, imported from Crete around 1200 were of the same type as those dated by Evans to {{the destruction}} of 1400.

25|$|The clay used in Corinth was soft, with a yellow, {{occasionally}} green tint. Faulty firing was {{a matter}} of course, occurring whenever the complicated firing procedure did not function as desired. The result was often unwanted coloring of the entire vase, or parts of it. After firing, the glossy slip applied to the vase turned dull black. The supplemental red and white colors first appeared in Corinth and then became very common. The painted vessels are usually of small format, seldom higher than 30cm. <b>Oil</b> <b>flasks</b> (alabastra, aryballos), pyxides, kraters, oenochoes and cups were the most common vessels painted. Sculptured vases were also widespread. In contrast to Attic vases, inscriptions are rare, and painters’ signatures even more so. Most of the surviving vessels produced in Corinth have been found in Etruria, lower Italy and Sicily. In the 7th and first half of the 6th centuries BC, Corinthian vase painting dominated the Mediterranean market for ceramics. It is difficult to construct a stylistic sequence for Corinthian vase painting. In contrast to Attic painting, for example, the proportions of the pottery foundation did not evolve much. It is also often difficult to date Corinthian vases; one frequently has to rely on secondary dates, such as the founding of Greek colonies in Italy. Based on such information an approximate chronology can be drawn up using stylistic comparisons, but it seldom has anywhere near the precision of the dating of Attic vases.|$|R

40|$|In this multi-disciplinary {{study of}} Roman glass from Karanis, Egypt, I combine archaeological, {{chemical}} compositional data, ethnoarchaeology, and historical insights {{to assess how}} objects were valued in the ancient world. The series of physical actions carried out and decisions made during the production of an artifact, in short, the chaîne opératoire, reflect shared concepts of value. By considering an object not as an end product, but {{as the result of}} a chaîne opératoire, I have been able to intimate the social agency underwriting the production process. My ethnoarchaeological study of modern glass workers in Cairo and in Hampshire, UK helps to reconstruct the chaîne opératoire of glass manufacturing and identifies relationships between value and ancient technology. Following the chaîne opératoire of glass manufacturing informed by chemical, morphological, and contextual analyses, I reconstruct object biographies of recently excavated artifacts from Karanis dating primarily to the late Roman period (4 th- 6 th centuries CE). 	Through onsite portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry analysis of recently excavated Karanis glass, I investigate the selection of raw materials. This research, combined with pXRF and electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) of museum specimens from Karanis, helps distinguish glass compositional groups. These compositional groups are identified through quantitative analysis of these data and consideration of the detection and accuracy limitations of pXRF. At least two compositional groups identified most likely represent recycled glass due to the presence of both manganese and antimony above trace levels. This research contributes to the debate regarding the location, organization, and scale of glass manufacturing during the Roman period. The combination of analytical, historical, and archaeological evidence allows me to assemble the life history of certain glass vessel types [...] unguentaria, rectangular bottles, and oil flasks—demonstrating relationships among phases of the chaîne opératoire of glass manufacturing and the social function of objects. 	In the late Roman period, an age when blown glass was commoditized and available to a broader demographic, only particular objects were considered luxury items. Karanidians tried to set themselves apart by using high-quality colorless <b>oil</b> <b>flasks</b> in the public sphere without ignoring the utility of glass as a container for oils and other commodities. For glass vessels that were most likely valued for the materials inside them rather than for the glass objects themselves, manufacturers preferred to use recycled glass. The diverse, yet complementary research techniques employed in this study expose the interplay between objects and social phenomena...|$|R

The remaining supernatant was extracted with equal volume of hexane for determination of emulsified crude oil. A week after growth (no apparent adhesive oil residues), 10 – 20  ml culture was sampled for determination of cell dry weight (cell mass), floating oils and emulsified oils at various time points in triplicate. All measurements were carried out in triplicate. Total amount of crude oil is calculated as the sum of unemulsified and emulsified oils.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test the efficacy of an indigenous white rot fungus Lentinus squarrosulus in degrading engine <b>oil</b> in soil. <b>Flasks</b> containing sterilized garden soil (100 g) moistened with 75 % distilled water (w/v) were contaminated with engine oil 1, 2. 5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 % w/w concentrations, inoculated with L. squarrosulus and incubated at room temperature for 90 days. Levels of organic matter, pH, total hydrocarbon and elemental content (C, Cu, Fe, K, N, Ni, Zn and available P) were determined post-fungal treatment. Results indicate that contaminated soils inoculated with L. squarrosulus had increased organic matter, carbon and available phosphorus, while the nitrogen and available potassium was reduced. A relatively high percentage degradation of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon (TPH) was observed at 1 % engine oil concentration (94. 46 %), which decreased to 64. 05 % TPH degradation at 40 % engine oil contaminated soil after 90 days of incubation. The concentrations of Fe, Cu, Zn and Ni recovered from straw/fungal biomass complex increased with the increase of engine-oil contamination and bio-accumulation by the white-rot fungus. The improvement of nutrient content values as well as the bioaccumulation of heavy metals at all levels of engine oil concentrations tested through inoculations with L. squarrosulus is of importance for the bioremediation of engine-oil polluted soils...|$|R
40|$|Screening of {{hydrocarbon}} degrading microorganisms {{isolated from}} three habitats in Western New York State by selective enrichment technique, {{resulted in the}} collection of 20 distinct species. All strains were cultivated in liquid media with crude oil as a sole carbon and energy source. Bacterial strains capable of degrading hydrocarbons belong to the genera Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas sp. Carbon dioxide evolution experiments were used as the major indicator of microbial degradation of <b>oil</b> in biometric <b>flasks.</b> The measurements of CO 2 evolution rates have shown to effectively evaluate the biodegradation rates by providing significant data within a short period. The chemical composition of the residual oil was determined by gas-chromatographic techniques. The results indicate that the highest accumulation of carbon dioxide and the highest degradation efficiency of medium chain alkanes were observed on Leepershank crude oil, whereas degradation of Mexican crude oil with a composition of higher saturated and substituted hydrocarbons was prolonged. Additionally, biodegradation of Smakover oil was significantly reduced due to a high content of aromatic and cyclic hydrocarbons. Noticeable formation of solubilizing agents was observed by GR 1 (not yet identified clone) and Serratia marcescens. The results also suggest that the application of bacterial consortiums containing combinations of two isolated strains enhanced the degradation of Mexican crude oil and also lead to a successful utilization of complex organic industrial waste. The bacterial mixture of GR 1 clone and Acinetobacter baumannii demonstrated the highest growth and CO 2 evolution on both substrates among all tested bacterial blends...|$|R
40|$|Xanthan gum is an {{important}} suspending, stabilizing, thickening and emulsifying agent in food and non-food industries. It is currently produced by a bioprocess using an aerobic bacterium Xanthomonas campestris. It {{has been found that}} the use of vegetable oils in the fermentation could overcome some problems in xanthan production. Therefore, this research was taken up to study the effect of supplementing the growth medium with palm-oil on xanthan production. Shake flask and bioreactor studies using Rushton and InterMIG impeller were carried out in this research. The fraction of oil used in formulating the growth medium was varied from 0. 05 to 0. 50 v/v <b>oil.</b> In shake <b>flask</b> studies with 0. 50 v/v oil, xanthan concentration was found to increase more than two fold. It was found that the viscosity of xanthan solution could be brought down from 719. 85 cP to 225. 50 cP as the oil fraction was increased. The apparent viscosity of the xanthan solutions with and without addition of oil decreased as the shear rate increased. The flow behavior index (n) for different xanthan solution and at the oil fraction range of 0. 05 v/v and 0. 15 v/v was less than one, which indicated pseudoplastic behavior. There was no significant reduction in the viscosity in the bioreactor studies. Nevertheless, xanthan production could be doubled by the addition of palm-oil. The effect of reusing the oil from previous runs on xanthan production was also evaluated. Xanthan concentration obtained in the fermentation with fresh oil was higher than the fermentation with recycled oil. The utilization of palm-oil as a secondary carbon source by the cells was identified from the lipase activities and glucose consumption rates. The optimum oil fraction in the bioreactor installed with Rushton and InterMIG impellers, at which lipase activities were maximum (0. 38 and 0. 24 U/mL, respectively), was found to be the same i. e. 0. 35 v/v. This shows that the potential of palm-oil as a secondary carbon source. In the fermentation with InterMIG impeller, the xanthan concentration increased from 17. 39 g/L to 38. 50 g/L in the fermentation with 0. 50 v/v oil whereas in the fermentation with Rushton impeller, the maximum xanthan concentration was found to be in the fermentation with 0. 25 v/v of oil. Fermentation runs using InterMIG impeller were found to give a higher concentration of xanthan gum than those using Rushton impeller. It was also found that xanthan concentration was found to increase with increasing aeration and agitation. It was also observed that the oxygen transfer is higher when the InterMIG impeller is used compared to Rushton impeller. The higher range of kLa and xanthan concentration were found to be around 20 h⁻¹ and 40 g/L respectively, at an optimum oil fraction of 0. 35 v/v for both the impellers. However, InterMIG impeller was found to consume higher power per unit volume (3. 3 W/L). FTIR analysis indicated that the properties of xanthan gum produced were nearly the same standard with the food grade xanthan gum...|$|R
40|$|Two hundred year's ago, Höganä's, a town {{situated}} in the north-west {{part of the county}} of Skåne, about 20 km north of the city of Helsingborg, had no local pottery tradition's. Höganä's wa's then a tiny fishing village that even lacked a harbour. Coal had now and then been quarried from an opencast mine and the local inhabitant's had collected it from the beach at low tide for their personal need's. When the mining industry started in 1797 and, with time, even the production of earthenware (1832), capital, labour, technology and pot design's were typically fetched from elsewhere. A's well a's the customer's. Nothing of thi's wa's to be found in Höganä's. The capital came from partie's interested in the mining, earthenware and brick industrie's. Here, in particular, Erik Ruuth, the Minister of Finance in Gustav III’'s parliament, wa's engaged. In 1786 he had bought the privilege's for mining coal in north-west Skåne, {{and at the same time}} established the earthenware factory, Ulfsunda, outside Stockholm where clay from the mining in Skåne wa's used. In 1792 large amount's of clay were found between thin seam's of coal in Höganä's and Ruuth brought in the mining engineer, Thoma's Stawford, from Newcastle in view of the coal mining that wa's the focu's of interest. Stawford brought with him not only mining technology to Höganä's from hi's native country but also something that resembled a town plan, including prototype's for worker's’ dwelling's. Coal mining in Höganä's wa's not a successful venture; the coal wa's difficult to mine and of poor quality and in the end attempt's were made to save the enterprise by starting to use the clay for the production of brick's and roofing tile's a's well – and from 1832 even earthenware. The kiln's were fired with coal from the mine's. In Höganä's there wa's hardly any local labour for either the mining or the earthenware factory. Russian prisoner's-of-war and children from orphanage's in Gothenburg, among other's, were used to work in the mine's. And at the start of the 1830 's the population censu's show's that potter's from Ängelholm and other town's in Skåne had been induced to move here. But the potter's in the newly established pottery work's would hardly have produced pot's like those they had been making in their previou's home town's. The piece's that were to be produced in Höganä's differed from the pottery made in the neighbouring town's under the constraint's of the local guild's with their often old-fashioned, traditional idiom's. From the outset, the focu's wa's on good's that would suit the mas's-production of more anonymou's and standardized kind's of article's for the growing market for the middle-classe's. A's early a's 1798 Ruuth sold the factory in Ulfsunda and established the Helsingborg Stoneware Factory that at the time wa's the only one in Sweden to manufacture brown, salt-glazed stoneware, chiefly household good's. In Höganä's, production of thi's type of salt-glazed stoneware wa's also started in 1835. A's with the technology, most of the model's produced at the pottery during the first decade's came from England, either directly or indirectly. However, these did not come from Newcastle in the northeast, Stawford’'s home town, but from the west Midland's and the cluster of small town's that are today amalgamated into The Potterie's, the cradle of the English industrial revolution. Here there wa's a rich flora of, in particular, ceramic industrie's a's well a's a combination of coal, clay, technology, transportation route's, market's – condition's similar to those that were also to be found in Höganä's in the 1800 's. But in actual fact it wa's a German porcelain potter, Carl Berger, who during the period of 1830 - 32 produced the first trial serie's of earthenware good's at the factory in Höganä's. Berger had most recently been working a's the foreman at the Gustavsberg factory where hi's task had been to experiment with flintware suitable for tableware and printed decoration. At Höganä's, Berger wa's to develop yellow lead-glazed ware that can be seen a's a simpler and more brittle imitation of the English flintware. A's far a's can be judged, Berger also contributed with a number of design's, reflecting English one's taken from hi's previou's activitie's at the Gustavsberg work's. During the very first year's of hi's employment at Höganä's simpler ornamental piece's were also being produced both in unglazed yellow earthenware and in black stoneware similar to basalt ware. The product's from Höganä's during the next two decade's consisted in both unglazed and lead-glazed earthenware and, from 1835, in salt-glazed ware in an increasing number of different design's. The earliest printed catalogue's (1835) cover a wide array of article's: drinking mug's, pot's with and without lip's, jam jar's, apothecary pot's, mustard pot's, serving dishe's, milk bowl's, soup terrine's, cooking pot's, flower pot's, bowl's, basin's, toilet set's, food basin's, chamber pot's, plate's, saucer's, butter dishe's, tea and coffee pot's, cream jug's, jelly mould's, soap dishe's, pipe bowl's, inkpot's, sand boxe's, small plate's, salad bowl's, deep dishe's, coffee cup's (with or without ear's), writing set's, flour sieve's, colander's, candlestick's, lamp's, salt cellar's, pepper pot's, doll's, water carafe's, <b>oil</b> <b>flask's,</b> mustard jar's, bidet's, medicine spoon's, sauce boat's, sugar bowl's… The list end's with a number of “toy's” (i. e. miniature's). In addition, there are brick's, roofing tile's, ornament's for building's etc. The range of model's on the whole goe's back to English prototype's in flintware which are also found in a number of variation's at quite a number of factorie's round the Baltic at thi's time. There are strong connection's particularly with the factorie's in Denmark such a's Ipsen's Enke, Herman A. Kähler a's well a's the Spietz and the Søholm work's on the Danish island of Bornholm out in the Baltic Sea. Moreover, many of the model's bear the stamp of the German architect, Georg Friedrich Hetsch, whose historicizing idiom, together with Bertel Thorvaldsen’'s sculpture had a considerable impact on Denmark during the first half of the 1800 's. All thi's i's reflected in the production of the 1800 's in Höganä's. In 1840, Johan Joachim Sjöcrona took over the management of the mining and earthenware production at the Höganä's factory, which time and again had been threatened with closure. He introduced a number of important social and financial reform's (school's, hospital's, pharmacie's, housing for the worker's, temperance movement's, librarie's, meeting-hall's etc.). It wa's also he who, in 1856, employed a young Danish artist, Ferdinand Ring, at the pottery. Ring wa's employed not a's a potter, but a's a sculptor and designer to produce prototype's for mas's production of, above all, variou's kind's of decorative object's, ornament's and architectural decoration's – rather typical task's at that time for a pottery that wa's aiming at meeting competition on a market larger than the one in Skåne. It wa's also probably Ring who lay behind the splendidly illustrated price catalogue over the 1859 production from the pottery. Thi's wa's the era for trade exhibition's with all they implied for internationalization and a growing importance for the visual form and marketing of the good's. The earthenware factory in Höganä's often participated successfully here, judging from the attention given by the pres's, but at the same time the financial gain wa's very small: the threat of closure loomed again in the minute's of the company board. Ferdinand Ring stayed on until 1869 and production continued, however, on a small scale. In 1889 Åke Nordenfelt entered the scene a's manager of the Höganä's company. Hi's private interest wa's one of contemporary ceramic art, in particular the polychrome majolica ware which, in a number of way's, wa's typical of the time. From hi's busines's trip's to England he brought back on hi's own initiative sample's of ceramic's that specially reflected the reformed creative design that i's associated with Christopher Dresser and other designer's, notably within the Art's & Craft's Movement. Such piece's, together with those associated with the contemporary development of artistic ceramic's in Denmark (Bindesbøll, Kähler and other's), came to be copied, on instruction from Nordenfelt, in a multitude of variation's at the Höganä's pottery. At the beginning of the 1890 's these good's caught the attention of people in the Swedish art's & craft's circle's who were interested in modern design, partly because they were mas's-produced, simple and cheap but were also now endowed with a new and energetic form, painted with colourful, running or spattered lead glaze's. These article's were regarded a's a fruitful, artistically valuable alternative to the traditional, historicizing and often overloaded ornament's of that time. The production in Höganä's wa's more or les's unparalleled in Sweden. In order to modernize the old-fashioned pottery’'s rudimentary technical equipment and work routine's, Gudmund Dahl wa's employed a's work's foreman in 1893. He introduced a number of innovation's. For instance, he developed the polychrome glaze on a white background instead of the previou's one which wa's built on a transparent lead glaze on yellow clay. He also installed pyrometer's in the kiln's to register the temperature more exactly and started a routine where each design wa's given a number which wa's stamped onto the good's and which could be found in a design's book that wa's continuously updated when new design's were introduced. Dahl also trained the future designer, Albin Hamberg (born 1875) and the future glazing master, Sigfrid Johansson (born 1879). It wa's a combination of management’'s equally arbitrary and personal interest's, a handful of young colleague's’ eagernes's and talent, the technical and social condition's, the prevailing stream's of idea's and style etc. that made possible thi's, in many way's, remarkable production. The artist, Helmer Osslund (Åslund) wa's employed a's an artistic advisor at the pottery in Höganä's during the winter of 1896 - 97. He had previously worked a's an artistic decorator at Gustavsberg, and studied art under Paul Gauguin and J. F. Willumsen in Pari's. He had even for a shorter period been in Copenhagen. Osslund wa's employed at the Höganä's work's to create a new and modern collection for the company’'s showcase at the coming art's and industry exhibition in Stockholm when the Höganä's company wa's to celebrate it's hundredth anniversary. But after only a couple of month's he got in conflict with the management of the pottery and resigned from hi's job. The avant-garde ceramic's with symbolistic root's that were shown at the exhibition in Stockholm attracted attention but gave rise to hardly any response from the company management. However, he inspired Albin Hamberg to train at the Technical College in Stockholm (the present the University College of Art's, Craft's and Design) where he spent three year's, 1897 - 1900. In a number of way's Osslund opened up a new world for Hamberg who wa's himself grandson of one of the child worker's from Gothenburg who had been employed in 1801 to work in the mine. In thi's way he got into closer contact with contemporary ceramic's which he studied and sketched at the Stockholm exhibition, in museum's and magazine's, leaving their mark in the pottery’'s design book at Höganä's. The illustrated price catalogue for 1905 show's a variety of example's of what Hamberg had seen and often skilfully transferred to glazed Höganä's clay. At thi's time, copying other producer's wa's the normal way of working for smaller factorie's. In the book of design's and the price catalogue it i's possible to trace hi's studie's and later scholarship trip's out in Europe. In Höganä's he founded a technical art school, wa's the initiator of a museum, and so on, and can be seen a's an artistic personality with the social awarenes's characteristic of the time before the turn of the last century. In 1914 he left the company’'s pottery with the intention of making a living a's a sculptor, a specialist teacher and a ceramist with hi's own workshop. Astrid Lilienberg-Sieurin worked for about one year at the pottery after Hamberg had left. She had just finished her studie's at the College of Art and made a number of piece's in decorative good's in light-coloured glaze, often in the sgrafitto technique on a light substance. In the following year, 1915, Edgar Böckman, got the job a's the artistic leader. The set's of tableware and ornament's he then produced in faience are actually among the earliest example's in Sweden of what would later be labelled “beautiful good's for daily use” (vackrare vardagsvara) with their characteristic organic and vegetable idiom and flowing ornamental pattern's painted by hand, after Böckman’'s sketche's, on the softly rounded lightly glazed ware. Thi's production actually took place a couple of year's prior to when the Swedish Society for Industrial Design started an agency in 1917 to induce industrie's to employ artistic designer's. The agency resulted in the “Home's Exhibition” at Liljevalch's during the same year where, among other's, Wilhelm Kåge and Edward Hald for the first time presented their new set's of tableware crockery. Thu's, Böckman’'s work from Höganä's had appeared earlier and wa's awarded prize's at the Liljevalch exhibition a's well. Böckman’'s idiom ha's some association with an older domestic faience tradition but the national character in the tableware ha's continental parallel's. Böckman’'s work ha's, above all, connection's with Danish decorative art from around the turn of the 1900 's, both with Thorvald Bindesbøll’'s work a's well a's with that of George Jensen – and maybe particularly with Jen's Thirslund’'s contemporary work at Herman A. Kähler’'s factory in Næstved. Moreover, Böckman developed a serie's of ornament's decorated with the lustre technique, garden urn's in terracotta in the classic style of the 20 's, and a more experimental serie's of ornament's with East Asian stoneware design's made in salt-glazed stoneware decorated with lustre glaze's which blackened at the high firing temperature in the salt-glazing kiln. In 1926 the production of set's of tableware crockery and ornament's wa's discontinued at the pottery in Höganä's (while the production of salt-glazed household ware continued until 1954).
