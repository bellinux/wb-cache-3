5|$|Some {{studies have}} found that deep frying in olive and {{sunflower}} oils {{has been found to be}} less of a detriment to health and in some cases have positive effects on insulin levels. <b>Oil</b> <b>can</b> be reused a few times after original use after straining out solids. However, excessive use of the same <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> cause it to break down and release compounds into the food that may be carcinogenic, affect liver health, or influence the body's ability to absorb vitamins. Some European countries have set public health standards for the safety of frying oil.|$|E
5|$|Although double-hull {{design is}} {{superior}} in low energy casualties and prevents spillage in small casualties, in high energy casualties where both hulls are breached, <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> spill through the double-hull {{and into the}} sea and spills from a double-hull tanker can be significantly higher than designs like the mid-deck tanker, the Coulombi egg tanker and even a pre-MARPOL tanker, as the last one has a lower oil column and reaches hydrostatic balance sooner.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>cans</b> {{were made}} by {{companies}} like Noera Manufacturing Company and Perfection in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Around this time, <b>oil</b> <b>cans</b> frequently leaked and contributed to fires. In 1957, aluminium <b>oil</b> <b>cans</b> were introduced, produced by companies like the American Can Company.|$|R

5|$|It is {{recommended}} that deep fryers be cleaned often to prevent contamination. The process of cooking with <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> also contaminate nearby surfaces as oil may splatter on adjacent areas. Oil vapors can also condense on more distant surfaces such as walls and ceilings. Supplies such as dish detergent and baking soda can effectively clean affected surfaces.|$|E
5|$|The figures, the {{minutely}} detailed clothes, and {{the architecture}} of the room and windows are depicted {{with a high degree of}} realism. Van Eyck's mastery at handling <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> be seen in the differing breadths of brush strokes. The precision of the detail achieved is especially noticeable in the rendering of threads of St. Donatian's blue and golden embroidered cope and mitre, in the weave of the oriental carpet, and in the stubble and veins on van der Paele's aging face.|$|E
5|$|At the FBI Academy, Dana Scully reads Mulder's initial report. The only {{connection}} between the murders that he can see is that the suspects all destroyed an electronic device during the killings. Meanwhile, Bonnie McRoberts, another Franklin resident, drops by a repair shop {{to pick up her}} car, where a message on an engine diagnostic display warns her that the mechanic is going to rape her. She impulsively kills him with an <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> spout. When Mulder and Spencer question her the next morning, her kitchen microwave instructs her to kill them. When she grabs a knife and attacks Mulder, she is shot and killed by Spencer.|$|E

5|$|Deep frying {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of waste oil, which must be disposed of properly. Waste <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls of sewage pipes, and interfere with sewage treatment. Waste oil from deep frying is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes {{the time required to}} deep fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2,000 watts.|$|E
5|$|Spilled hot cooking <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> {{also cause}} severe third degree burns, In the {{worst-case}} scenario, severe burns can be fatal. The higher temperatures and tendency {{of oil to}} stick to the skin make spilled hot cooking oil far more dangerous than spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place their hands on top of the stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|E

50|$|Essential oils {{are used}} {{extensively}} as GRAS flavoring agents in foods, beverages, and confectioneries according to strict Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and flavorist standards. Pharmacopoeia standards for medicinal oils should be heeded. Some <b>oils</b> <b>can</b> be toxic to some domestic animals, cats in particular. The internal use of essential <b>oils</b> <b>can</b> pose hazards to pregnant women, as some can be abortifacients in dose 0.5-10 ml, and thus {{should not be}} used during pregnancy.|$|R

25|$|Often called {{conventional}} heavy oil, this low-density <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> {{be recovered}} by conventional drilling techniques or by waterflood, a technique of injecting {{water into the}} reservoir to increase pressure, thus forcing the oil toward the well bore. When these techniques work, heavy oil is like the more commercially attractive lighter grades of oil. But heavy <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> also be quite viscous. It can need some form of heat or solvent and pressure before it can flow into a well bore to be produced. When heavy oil requires these techniques to go into production, it is known as non-conventional heavy oil.|$|E

25|$|Vegetable <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> {{be used as}} an {{alternative}} fuel in diesel engines and in heating oil burners. When vegetable oil is used directly as a fuel, in either modified or unmodified equipment, it is referred to as straight vegetable oil (SVO) or pure plant oil (PPO). Conventional diesel engines can be modified to help ensure that the viscosity of the vegetable oil is low enough to allow proper atomization of the fuel. This prevents incomplete combustion, which would damage the engine by causing a build-up of carbon. Straight vegetable <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> also be blended with conventional diesel or processed into biodiesel or bioliquids for use under a wider range of conditions.|$|E

50|$|Animal {{fats and}} {{vegetable}} oils {{might have been}} used as shaving lubricant since the practice of shaving began. While not as commonly used as traditional foams (creams) and gels the use of shave oils is growing in popularity, largely due to their greater protection, razor glide-enabling and moisturizing properties, and because shave <b>oils</b> <b>can</b> be made without the addition of toxic chemical ingredients. Shave <b>oils</b> <b>can</b> also assist in making the shave smoother and closer and they may provide a less irritating shave for users.|$|R
