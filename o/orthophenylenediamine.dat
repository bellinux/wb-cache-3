In this work, the OPD coatings were obtained by electrochemical reduction of orthonitroaniline (ONA) using dilute sulphuric acid as supporting electrolyte. The characterization of the coating was done by infrared spectroscopic and scanning electron microscopic studies. The non porous nature of the coating was determined by ferroxyl test.

The attempted synthesis produced a green precipitate with a high melting point and poor solubility in organic solvents, unlikely characteristics for compound 1 seen on the page. This project was set aside due to the apparent failure to produce the desired compound. (II) The effect of Wilkinson 2 ̆ 7 s catalyst on the treatment of cyclohexene oxide with borane-THF at 72 for 5 1 / 2 hours was also investigated. Oxidation of the organoborane formed by both the catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions produced cyclohexanol. Another significant product was one which, according to GC-MS, had a molecular weight of 172. This product was not completely identified. Studies of the progress of both the catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions were conducted using TLC. TLC showed no evidence of the starting material, cyclohexene oxide, after 30 minutes of reflux.

BSOPD {{was chosen as the}} UV-Visible absorbing chelating ligand because of its ability to form stable complexes with metal ions. Both the metal ions can be determined in single run under optimized conditions with run time of 12 minutes including coexisted ions usually present in waste water. Separation was achieved at optimized conditions of 50 mM phosphate buffer as a background electrolyte at pH = 3. 4, at applied voltage of - 10 kV and detection wavelength of 231 nm. Under above mentioned conditions, limit of quantification (0. 5 and 10 µg mL- 1) and detection limit (0. 1667 and 3. 33 µg mL- 1) were found for Au(III) and Cr(VI), respectively.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The immune {{response}} combines {{a series of}} signals and complex mechanisms to occur, which can be modulated and enhanced. This one according the popular knowledge is possible using plant extracts, being one of them the plant extract JV- 001. This showed, in previous studies, the ability to activate and enhance the cellular {{immune response}} of murine origin, but its effect on human leukocyte level is unknown, so {{the objective of this}} work was to study the effect of JV- 001 in human leukocytes. MATERIAL AND METHOD: In this paper was used heparinized blood of healthy males, at first instance, this was treated with NH 4 Cl 64 % to obtain total leukocytes, and in another, separate the mononuclear fraction by Histopaque® gradient. The cells obtained were adjusted to 8 x 106; aliquots of 100 µL of JV- 001 or PBS. The plate was incubated at 37 ºC for 30 minutes and then washed, the peroxidase remaining in each recipient was revealed and determined with <b>Orthophenylenediamine</b> and H 2 O 2, expressing the proceeds as absorbance read at 450 nm. RESULTS: The results showed an increase in total leukocyte adhesion between 44. 35 % and 63. 3 %, expressed by obtaining a positive delta absorbance with respect to controls. DISCUSSION: The mechanism that increases the adhesion is unknown, but probably due to increased expression of integrins. It {{is important to note that}} this increase does not occur upon incubation of mononuclear or polymorphonuclear cells separately, suggesting that the active principle of JV- 001 not only does not act directly on adherent cells...|$|E

40|$|First row {{transition}} metals are attractive candidates for catalysis {{because they are}} much more abundant, cheaper, and less toxic than their 2 nd and 3 rd row congeners. Unfortunately, these first row metals typically promote one electron (radical) processes instead of the two electron transformations observed in oxidation/reduction and bond breaking/forming reactions. One way around this is to use redox noninnocent ligands that have the capacity to store electrons and then release them {{over the course of the}} catalytic cycle to limit the oxidation state changes that occur at the metal center. The goal of this work was to expand the scope of redox non-innocent ligands in development of new catalytic processes. A tridentate ligand was synthesized that contained a 2 -pyridine methylamine arm on a nacnac ligand backbone. Deprotonation at the methylene position formed a new redox non-innocent ligand that was stable only in the bis-reduced form chelated to Fe(II). The neutral ligand was prone to intramolecular cyclization via C-N bond formation to form a new pyrimidine ring structure while the monoanionic ligand was prone to reductive coupling with formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. This system showed a strong preference for maintaining a ferrous state of iron with C-C or C-N bond formation observed when the redox noninnocent ligand was in its neutral or mono-anionic form. A tetradentate ligand was synthesized with diimine and <b>orthophenylenediamine</b> functionalities that could exist in 5 different oxidation states from neutral to tetraanionic, which should support group transfer reactivity. The ligand was installed on iron and manganese to form standard M+ 2 coordination compounds. The corresponding chromium compound showed a different electronic structure consistent with a reduced ligand. Remarkably, it was shown calculationally to have an S= 1 ligand antiferromagnetically coupled to a high spin Cr 2 + metal center. Cyclic voltammetric measurements exhibited two reversible one-electron ligand reductions as well as three quasi-reversible oxidations consistent with 1 metal based oxidation and two ligand based oxidations. 2019 - 08 - 1...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} into the mechanism and kinetics of {{the dissolution of}} synthetic zinc sulfide and zinc concentrate in aqueous solutions containing sulfur dioxide. Experiments at ambient temperature established that the dissolution of ZnS in aqueous solutions of sulfur dioxide proceeds via acidic non-oxidative dissolution and not by direct reaction of the sulfide with S 02 (aq). The non-oxidative dissolution reaction generates H 2 S(aq) or HS-(aq) species which are thought to rapidly react with sulfurous acid species, S 02 (aq) or HS 03 -(aq), to possibly produce initially sulfane monosulfonates as intermediates, followed by sulfane disulfonates and elemental sulfur. The formation of sulfane monosulfonates is postulated based upon inhibition observed in ZnS / S 02 leaches which is not attributable to either H 2 S(aq) or occlusion elemental sulfur. At elevated temperatures (100 oC - 200 oC) the rate of ZnS dissolution in sulfurous acid {{is affected by the}} thermal decomposition of sulfurous acid, which produces sulfuric acid, which leaches the mineral non-oxidatively. Increasing the temperature increases the rate of thermal decomposition of sulfurous acid and consequently, the rate of sulfuric acid formation, increasing the rate of ZnS dissolution. The kinetics of the dissolution of ZnS in solutions of sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide were investigated at temperatures up to 200 oC. At 100 oC and 150 oC, the dissolution of ZnS in H 2 SO 4 was found to obey the relationd[Zn 2 +]/dt = kfAs[H+] krAs[H 2 S(aq) ] 1 / 2 [Zn 2 +] 1 / 2 and equilibria and rate constants for the ZnS / H 2 S 04 reaction were obtained over the range, 100 oC to 200 oC. The activation energies of the forward and reverse reactions were found to be 56 +/- 11 kJ mol- 1 and 45 +/- 15 kJ mol- 1, respectively. The equilibrium constants were 4. 99 x 10 - 4, 1. 26 x 10 - 3 and 2. 83 x 10 - 3 at 100 oC, 150 oC and 200 oC, respectively. In the presence of added S 02, ++at low ZnS pulp density (0. 5 g L- 1), the rate of ZnS dissolution in sulfuric acid increased due to the removal of H 2 S(aq) by reaction with S 02 (aq) or HS 03 -(aq). However the increase in rate was much less than that expected for the complete removal of H 2 S(aq). As with leaches of ZnS in sulfurous acid at ambient temperature, the inhibition was not attributable to the presence of residual H 2 S(aq) or to occlusion of unreacted ZnS by elemental sulfur, but is thought to be due to aqueous species that are like "H 2 S", in that they may react with Zn 2 + to reprecipitate W. To this end, sulfane monosulfonates have again been postulated. The rate of ZnS dissolution, under conditions of low pulp density, was independent Of S 02 concentration, suggesting that under these conditions the rate of the H 2 S / S 02 reaction is also independent of the S 02 concentration. At higher pulp densities (200 g L- 1), similar to those expected in an industrial application, synthetic zinc sulfide leached rapidly in H 2 S 04 / S 02 solutions to approximately 60 % zinc extraction, but was then inhibited by the large amounts of sulfur that formed. These caused agglomerates of zinc sulfide and elemental sulfur to form, even at temperatures below the melting point of sulfur, reducing the surface area of zinc sulfide available for reaction. Leaches of zinc concentrate at low pulp densities in H 2 S 04 / S 02 solutions and at temperatures above sulfur's meting point, were inhibited by the formation of molten sulfur. In contrast to synthetic zinc sulfide, zinc concentrate is readily wet by molten sulfur. Three surfactants <b>orthophenylenediamine,</b> quebracho and sodium ligninsulfonate were found to be reasonably effective in preventing molten sulfur from occluding the mineral surface. At high pulp densities, the H 2 S 04 / S 02 leach solution was unable to effect, the extraction of zinc from a zinc concentrate beyond approximately ++ 10 %. Integral S 02 / H 2 S 04 leaching of zinc concentrate was found not to be a commercial prospect. However, sidestream processing of zinc concentrate in an acid leach stage followed by reaction of generated H 2 S with S 02 from the roasting stage to produce elemental sulfur may be viable...|$|E
