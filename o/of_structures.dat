40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} the types of imperative sentences on the medicine brochure andto describe the syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> imperative sentences on the medicine brochure. The type {{of this research is}} descriptive qualitative. The writer uses medicine brochures as the data source. The method of collecting data is documentation with the techniques of reading, identifying, and classifying the data. In analyzing the data, the writer identifies the types of imperative sentences using theory <b>of</b> grammatical <b>structure</b> from Quirk (1983) and describes the syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> imperative sentence using Chinese boxes from Francis (1958). The result of this study shows that (1) imperative sentence on the medicine brochure can be divided into two types: imperative sentence without a subject and negative imperative sentence, (2) there are six types <b>of</b> syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> imperative sentence in the medicine brochure: syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification, syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification + <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> predication, syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> complementation + <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification, syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> complementation + <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination + <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification, syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification + <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination, and syntactic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> complementation + <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination...|$|R
40|$|Driven by the {{philosophy}} of the ‘primacy <b>of</b> <b>structure</b> over data’, Component-Based Open Hypermedia Systems (CB-OHS) present an open set <b>of</b> <b>structure</b> servers providing structural abstractions of different hypermedia domains. To address the emergent requirements and to facilitate the development <b>of</b> <b>structure</b> servers, structure should be handled as a first class entity. We propose patterns for structure, called templates, that define the structural model upon which structure servers operate. We present how structure servers are developed and operate in the Callimachus CB-OHS. Development <b>of</b> <b>structure</b> servers within Callimachus is based on the explicit specification <b>of</b> <b>structure</b> with the use of an atomic structural primitive called the structural element. Explicit structure specification eases the development <b>of</b> <b>structure</b> servers in CB-OHS, making such development less error prone and providing the basis for tailoring domain specific abstractions...|$|R
30|$|The {{calculated}} A {{parameters are}} listed near the corresponding point in Fig.  5 a, b. One {{can see that}} the value of A is very close but not exactly the same for different light incident directions. This is attributed to the slightly difference between CSB/CSF and n 2 /n 1 as well as the accuracy of the simulation software. For the same structure with different substrate refractive indices, the A value increases with the increasing of the substrate refractive indices, which {{can be attributed to the}} increased polarizability of the Au NPs with the increasing of the LSP resonance wavelength [43 – 45]. One the other hand, one should be aware that the A value <b>of</b> <b>structure</b> A is much bigger than that <b>of</b> <b>structure</b> C for different structures with the same substrate refractive indices. It means that the polarizability of the Au NPs for structure A is much bigger than that <b>of</b> <b>structure</b> C, which can be proven by Fig.  2 b, d. It is interesting that although the polarizability of the Au NPs <b>of</b> <b>structure</b> A is bigger than that <b>of</b> <b>structure</b> C, the scattering peak intensities <b>of</b> <b>structure</b> A is smaller than that <b>of</b> <b>structure</b> C (Fig. 4). This can be attributed to the higher absorption <b>of</b> <b>structure</b> A. Figure 5 c, d shows the scattering and absorption spectra <b>of</b> <b>structure</b> A and C respectively, the refractive index of the substrate is 2.0 for both structures and light is incident from back side. One {{can see that the}} absorption <b>of</b> <b>structure</b> A is much higher than that <b>of</b> <b>structure</b> C. Thus for <b>structure</b> A, most <b>of</b> the energy that excite the LSPs is consumed via absorption and does not scattered.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} trying to analyze the types <b>of</b> {{syntactic}} <b>structures</b> on the lyrics of "Rage Against The Machine", particularly on its structural patterns. The writer {{is trying to}} find out what types <b>of</b> syntactic <b>structures</b> are found and the most predominant type <b>of</b> syntactic <b>structures</b> in the six rap songs of "Rage Against The Machine". The writer uses qualitative approach to analyze the six rap songs of "Rage Against The Machine". To be able to analyze the rap songs, he applies the basic four types <b>of</b> syntactic <b>structures</b> based on Francis's theory as the major theory supported by Saymour Chatman on inversion. The four types <b>of</b> syntactic <b>structures,</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification, <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> predication, <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> complementation, and <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination, are found in the six rap songs. There is not any inversion of word order applied in rap songs, except in the two lines of 'Take the power back', line 11 and 37. The writer also finds there are similarities between the lyrics and the poem in form and <b>structure.</b> Both <b>of</b> them have verses and the lines constitute a structural relation between/among the lines. Structurally related lines of "Rage Against the Machine" construct three types of bigger construction <b>of</b> syntactic <b>structures,</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification, <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> predication, and <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination. Finally he finds that <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> predication is the most predominant type of all that reaches more than 50 %, followed by <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> modification, <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> complementation, and the least predominant is <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> coordination...|$|R

40|$|Structured text is {{a general}} concept that is {{implicit}} {{in a variety of}} approaches to handling information. Syntactically, an item <b>of</b> <b>structured</b> text is a number of grammatically simple phrases together with a semantic label for each phrase. Items <b>of</b> <b>structured</b> text may be nested within larger items <b>of</b> <b>structured</b> text. The semantic labels in a structured text are meant to parameterize a stereotypical situation, and so a particular item <b>of</b> <b>structured</b> text is an instance of that stereotypical situation. Much information is potentially available as structured text including tagged text in XML, text in relational and object-oriented databases, and the output from information extraction systems in the form of instantiated templates.
