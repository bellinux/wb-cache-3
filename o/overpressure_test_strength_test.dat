The glass fibre used was 12 mm Cem-Fil Alkali-Resistant (AR) glass fibre added into the concrete at a percentage of 0. 5 by volume of concrete. The result shows that the addition of glass fibres reduced the workability of the concrete but the use of superplasticiser helped to compensate the loss. In term of mechanical properties, glass fibres reduced the compressive strength of the concrete for about 10. 0 % but 20 % replacement of cement with POFA gave a 5. 4 % improvement to the compressive strength at later age.
