5000|$|Although {{there is}} no {{standard}} for the depth of equipment, nor specifying the <b>outer</b> <b>width</b> and depth of the rack enclosure itself (incorporating the structure, doors and panels that contain the mounting rails), {{there is a tendency}} for 4-post racks to be 600 mm or 800 mm wide, and for them to be 600 mm, 800 mm or 1010 mm deep. This of course varies by manufacturer, the design of the rack and its purpose, but through common constraining factors (such as raised floor tile dimensions), these dimensions have become quite common. The extra width and depth enables cabling to be routed with ease (also helping to maintain bend-radius for fibre and copper cables) and deeper equipment to be utilised. A common feature in IT racks are mounting positions for [...] "Zero-U" [...] accessories, such as PDU (power distribution units) and vertical cable managers/ducts, that utilise the space between the rear rails and the side of the rack enclosure.|$|E

They usually nest in a cavity on a stream side but will sometimes make use of nearby buildings. In a study of nest-site selection in the Silent Valley area, a total of 21 nests were found mostly on rocks {{along the edge of}} streams and one each in a tree hole and inside an abandoned building. The nest is a cup made of moss, bamboo roots and grass, with a broad base and tapering towards the top. The base of the nest appeared to be cemented to the rock with mud.

40|$|Strip transects {{located along}} roads are {{commonly}} used to estimate waterfowl populations and characterize associated wetland habitat. We used data collected in May and early June, 1995, on forty-five 40 -km 2 plots in North Dakota to evaluate bias of 800 -m and 400 -m wide roadside transects for sampling wetlands relative to a larger (40 -km 2) scale and to compare duck abundance at the two widths. Densities of all basins combined and of seasonal basins considered alone were biased high for both transect widths, but mean bias {{did not differ from}} zero for temporary or semipermanent basins. Biases did not occur when excavated seasonal and temporary basins (i. e., road ditches) were excluded from the sample. Mean basin density was higher for the inner (400 -m) transect width than for the <b>outer</b> transect <b>width</b> (area remaining of the 800 -m transect, outside of center 400 -m width) for all basins combined and for seasonal and temporary basins. We detected an area-related bias in the occurrence of basins in transects: smaller basins (0. 08 – 1. 6 ha) were over-represented in transect samples by 2. 9 – 6. 5 %, and larger basins ($ 11 ha) were under-represented in 800 -m transects by 7. 3 % and in 400 -m transects by 16. 3 %. We compared the distribution of ducks relative to water conditions in the inner and <b>outer</b> transect <b>widths</b> to evaluate whether they were affected by proximity to the road. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos L.), northern pintails (A. acuta L.), and gadwall (A. strepera L.) responded to water conditions equally in the inner and <b>outer</b> transect <b>widths,</b> but northern shovelers (A. clypeata L.) and blue-winged teal (A. discors L.) responded more strongly to wetlands on the inner than the <b>outer</b> transect <b>width,</b> indicating that estimates of these species would be higher from a 400 - m wide transect than from an 800 -m wide transect. Differences in an adjustment index, used to account for the portion of basin obscured from view, were highly variable between inner and <b>outer</b> transect <b>widths</b> but did not indicate that use of wider transects was hampered by visibility. Biases of transect sampling need to be carefully considered when extrapolating wetland basin or duck densities from transects to larger landscape scales...|$|R

Its a simple and readly available technique and represents an inexpensive assessment of fracture risk in clinics where evaluation of bone age is common Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heritable disorder of bone formation resulting in low bone mass and propensity to fracture. The disorder is currently classified into seven types based on differences in clinical presentation and bone architetture. Our aim was to determinate the metacarpal morphometry in prepuberal children with types I-III-IV OI, before and after bisphosphonate treatment. Subjects The patients population comprised 14 consecutive prepuberal children with OI, aged 1. 5 to 12. 5 years (6 female; age 2 - 10. 3 years and 8 males; age 1. 5 - 12. 5 years). The patients were clinically classified according to the criteria established by Sillence. The control population consisted of 60 age. mached children age 1. 2 - 12. 5 years (30 females, age 2 - 10. 5 and 30 males; age 1. 5 - 12). Six patients (3 males and 3 females) were treated with intravenous neridronate (2 mg/Kg) every three months for one yearResults Metacarpal morphometry did not show any significant difference in respect to the sex in control and patient groups. In patients group we found a significant decrease of cortical width (1. 74 ± 0. 78 vs 2. 81 ± 0. 78; p< 0. 001) with no significant change in medullary inner width (3. 49 ± 0. 89 vs 3. 16 ± 0. 27; p= 0. 11) and total <b>outer</b> <b>width</b> (5. 23 ± 1. 04 vs 5. 85 ± 0. 78; p= 0. 03). As consequence MI showed values significatly lower than the pre-treatment levels (0. 33. ± 0. 13 vs 0. 45 ± 0. 05; p< 0. 001). In six patients, after neridronate treatment, it has been observed a significant increase of cortical width (2. 25 ± 0. 69 vs 1. 71 ± 0. 71, p< 0. 005) with higher MI (0. 41 ± 0. 15 vs 0. 33 ± 0. 13; p< 0. 003) whereas no significant increase differences have been found regarding the total <b>outer</b> <b>width</b> 5. 61 ± 1. 05 vs 5. 24 ± 1. 39; p= 0. 2) and no significant reduction medullary inner widhth (3. 36 ± 1. 2 vs 3. 53 ± 1. 24; p= 0. 1) was observed [...] Conclusions Our results demonstrate that MI, feeling the effects of bisphosphonate treatment in children with Oi, is a useful parameter to evaluate the biomechanical properties of cortical bone. Therefore the simple radiographs of the hand, performed in these children to assess skeletal age, may lead, by means of metacarpal morphometry, to further understanding of bone-strenght related factor...|$|E

40|$|Turbochargers {{are widely}} used in the {{automotive}} industry to reduce engine emissions and to increase the power. Centrifugal compressors {{are an integral part}} of turbochargers. Centrifugal compressors comprises primarily of inducer, impeller, diffuser and volute. The diffuser has an important role in the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Over the past few decades, researchers have been trying to increase the total-to-total compressor stage efficiency by altering the diffuser’s geometries. Many different methods have been adopted for this purpose, like pinching the diffuser walls, tilting the diffuser walls etc. Pinching increases the <b>outer</b> <b>width</b> of the diffuser while tilting provides an increased radial length. In the present study, both these methods have been used simultaneously. The primary benefit of doing so is to make the turbocharger compressor stage more compact in design, which is the current requirement of the automotive market. In order to investigate the effect of pinching and tilting of diffuser walls, a Computational Fluid Dynamics based solver has been used to predict the flow phenomena within the compressor, especially in the vaneless diffuser. Design of Experiments, using Taguchi’s method, has been incorporated in this study to statistically define the scope of the numerical work, and to obtain the optimal configuration of pinching and tilting that leads to maximum total-to-total compressor stage efficiency. The results depict that the compressor stage efficiency increases up to a tilt angle of 6. 25 º, after which it starts to decrease. Furthermore, the stage efficiency increases with increase of diffuser outlet width i. e., pinching the diffuser passage, however, this increasing trend has been observed up to an outlet width ratio of 1. 23, after which the stage efficiency starts to decrease. Hence, the optimal diffuser model, based on the combined tilting and pinching results obtained, which leads to the maximum total-to-total compressor stage efficiency, has been identified and analysed...|$|E

Experiments {{were conducted with}} air as working fluid. A uniform wall temperature at the inner wall of annulus was maintained while the outer pipe was kept insulated. Twist ratios (ratio of the pitch to <b>outer</b> <b>width</b> of twisted square duct) of 10. 6 and 15 {{were used in the}} experiments. The transitional Reynolds number for laminar flow to turbulent flow was identified as 3000. Results were compared with the flow inside the annulus of an equivalent straight square duct in a circular pipe for identical pumping power. Results showed considerable enhancement in the heat {{transfer and}} pressure drop in both the laminar and turbulent flow regimes. The influence of the annulus parameter on the friction factor and heat transfer was also studied by varying the outer pipe diameter. At a given twist ratio, higher values of the friction factor and the Nusselt number were observed for smaller annulus parameters (ratio of cross section area of square twisted duct to cross section area of circular pipe). In order to extend the experimental results to a larger range of fluids, a numerical analysis was undertaken for fully developed flow inside the annulus for the experimental twist ratios. The parameters range covered in the simulations were Reynolds numbers of 100 - 100, 000 and Prandtl numbers of 0. 7 - 20. The local velocity distribution across the annulus cross-section were analysed. Empirical correlations for friction factor and Nusselt number are provided separately for laminar and turbulent regimes. Guidelines for selection of twisted square duct are provided in terms of Reynolds number and enhancement factor. The results are significant because it will {{contribute to the development of}} compact double pipe heat exchangers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|E

Limited by the aspect {{ratio of the}} resist used in the fabrication, the gold-plating thickness of that zone plate is around 40 nm. However, some applications, in particular, biological imaging, prefer improved efficiency, which {{can be achieved by}} high-aspect-ratio zone plates.

As our first attempt, a 40 -nm-outer-zone-width MZP with a nickel-plating thickness of 150 nm (aspect ratio of 4 : 1) was successfully fabricated. Relative to the 25 -nm MZP, this zone plate is ten times more efficient. Using this high-efficiency MZP, a line test pattern with half period of 30 nm is resolved by the microscope at photon energy of 500 eV. Furthermore, with a new multilayer mirror, the XM- 1 can now perform imaging up to 1. 8 keV. An image of a line test pattern with half period of 40 nm has a measured modulation of 90 %.

Ages of some samples with poor quality counts were estimated with non-parametric multiplicative regression (NPMR; McCune 2006). These regression models were built in HYPERNICHE version 1.34 (© MjM Software, Gleneden Beach, Oregon, USA) using high quality samples; models were then used to estimate ages for poor quality samples of each species separately. Model building was implemented using local mean, Gaussian weights, and minimum average N* = 1; minimum N* = 1 was required to produce an age estimate. Predictor variables available for each model were sample diameter; height at which the sample was taken; time since last recorded fire (as an indicator of expected age of shrubs with fire-stimulated germination); mean <b>outer</b> ring <b>width,</b> calculated from the combined width of rings across the last 20 yr, or the last 10 yr of growth for shrubs < 20 yr old, measured to the nearest mm; and chaparral community type. The response variable, sample age, {{as well as the}} predictor variables sample diameter and height at cut, were log-transformed prior to analysis.|$|R

40|$|With many {{advances}} in the last decade, soft x-ray zone plate microscopy {{has come to be}} a valuable imaging technique that complements conventional nano-analytic techniques such as electron and scanning probe microscopies. It offers large elemental, chemical and magnetic sensitivities and a myriad of permissible in-situ sample conditions at sub- 50 nm spatial resolution. The highest measured resolution was 20 nm [1], achieved with a 25 nm outermost zone width zone plate at the full-field microscope XM- 1, at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), Berkeley. The zone plate was fabricated using e-beam lithography. As spatial resolution is roughly equal to the outermost zone width of zone plate, zone width reduction has been the center focus of x-ray microscopy. While e-beam lithography has been providing a path to fabricate high resolution zone plates, shrinkage of <b>outer</b> zone <b>width</b> from 25 nm to 20 nm and below, however, was extremely difficult due to fabrication process limitations in dense line fabrication, such as electron scattering, low e-beam resist contrast and development issues. Isolated lines on the other hand, do not suffer from these problems, and lines of around 10 nm wide can be routinely fabricated. This fact led us to develop a new zone plate fabrication technique, in which a dense zone plate pattern is divided into two (or more) semi-isolated, complementary patterns, and each pattern is sequentially fabricated and overlaid to the other patterns. The key of success to thi...|$|R
40|$|In the double-muscled (DM) Belgian Blue beef (BBB) breed, {{caesarean}} section (CS) is being applied systematically as a management tool to prevent dystocia. As {{a matter of}} fact, CS is the only possible way of calving in the breed. High birth weight and a relatively small pelvic area are the main causes of dystocia and, in the DM-BBB breed, {{the reasons for the}} systematically applied CS. Selection for lower birth weight and larger pelvic sizes might reduce dystocia and routine CS. Few data on inner pelvic sizes of pedigree animals are available. Using external measurements to estimate the inner pelvic sizes might be an option to resolve this problem. In this study, animals of the DM-BBB breed were measured and weighed on farms and in abattoirs. External and internal pelvic sizes increased with live weight and age of the animals. Gender had a significant influence on inner pelvic traits. Increased muscular conformation was associated with decreased inner pelvic dimensions. Models with weight, gender, age, withers height and <b>outer</b> pelvic <b>width</b> (TcTc) can be used to estimate inner pelvic sizes (R- 2 between 0. 35 and 0. 77). The estimated inner pelvic sizes can then be used to genetically evaluate pelvic traits in the DM-BBB breed. Improving weight, withers height and TcTc width in combination with lowering muscular conformation may help to decrease the high rate of {{caesarean section}} in the DM-BBB. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} of bearings {{has been a}} major research topic for more than five decades. To validate and improve the condition monitoring techniques, this paper focuses on the de-velopment of an innovative and versatile bearing test rig. The rig allows applying a fully controlled multi-axial static and dy-namic load on different types and sizes of bearings. Easy ad-justment to mount bearings with different inner diameter, <b>outer</b> diameter and <b>width</b> is possible, without compromising on perfor-mance. Furthermore, the behaviour of the bearing is monitored by accelerometers, proximity probes and thermocouples. During the design of the rig, several techniques were applied to ensure clean measurements, with maximum repeatability, and to reduce errors due to temperature variations. Finally, introducing an ad-ditional dynamic force on the bearing makes it possible to load the bearing as if it were built into a real machine, for example a gearbox. At the time this paper is written, results of the test rig were not yet available. However, the authors expect to be able to report on the first test results during the conference. ∗Address all correspondence to this author...|$|R
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} {{for the first}} time that the gas sensing properties of a spinel ferrite complex metal oxide semiconductor can be improved by controlling iron stoichiometry. Conductivity and sensitivity was analysed for ZnFe 2 +zO 4 ± spinel type ferrite with z from - 0, 01 to 0, 15. By increasing iron content from z=- 0, 01 to z= 0, 1, sensitivity increases up to 3 times but for samples with z> 0, 1 sensitivity drops. It was observed from impedance spectroscopy measurements that resistance decreases with an increase of the iron content. Complex impedance spectra reveal two phases with different resistance attributed to depletion layer (Rd) and bulk (Rb). With increasing iron content increases Rd/Rb ratio due to decrease of depletion layer <b>width.</b> <b>Outer</b> surface of the grain of the sensing material estimated higher ratio (Rd(air) /Rd(gas)) with gas exposure in comparison with bulk (Rb(air) /Rb(gas)). Overall sensitivity increases due to increase of donor concentration leading down to increase adsorbed oxygen species on grain surface. Sensitivity drops when z > 0, 1 due to remarkable decrease of depletion layer width...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} {{concerns}} about safety during their insertion, cervical spine pedicle screws have demonstrated biomechanical superiority over lateral mass screws in several biomechanical studies. One of the concerns for placement of cervical pedicle screws is their small size. Preoperative planning with computed tomography to assess pedicle width {{has been shown to}} be extremely accurate and is recommended by several authors. To date there has been no study assessing the accuracy of oblique radiographs for pedicle measurement. We sought to compare accuracy of the oblique radiographic measurements of cervical pedicle width with axial CT scan measurements. Five fresh-frozen human cadaveric cervical spines C 3 –C 7 were studied. Thin cut 1. 25  mm computed tomography axial cuts were made through the pedicle isthmus. Oblique radiographs at 35 °, 45 °, and 55 ° angles were taken of the right and left pedicles of each specimen using a standardized technique. Each radiograph contained a pin of known length to correct for magnification. All pedicles were again measured and corrected for magnification using the standard pin. Corrected oblique radiograph measurements were compared to CT for each specimen. The <b>outer</b> pedicle <b>width</b> was measured and agreed upon by consensus. The radiograph measurements were on average significantly larger than CT measurements for the pedicles indicating that the pin standard did not completely correct magnification. Plain radiographic data failed to reveal that one oblique angle was favorable to another in terms of magnification or precision. Plain radiographs at oblique angles do not provide accurate measurements of subaxial cervical pedicles at 35 °, 45 °, or 55 ° angles. We recommend that thin cut axial CT scans be obtained on all patients prior to transpedicular fixation in the cervical spine...|$|R
30|$|The reconstruction, with 15.5  nm voxel length, {{revealed}} limited {{details in}} the internal structures of the particle which is shown in Fig.  1 b. The loss of finer nanostructure detail is evident when compared to a typical TXM image as shown in Fig.  1 a. This information loss can be contributed to three major factors. First is the incomplete set of projections. With 30 ° of rotation information missing from the projections, some sample information is lost. The computation challenges associated with partial angle tomography is discussed elsewhere (Schneider et al. 2010). In addition, the large angle increment would also affect the final spatial resolution of the reconstruction. Second is the weak penetration depth of a 510  eV through the sample thickness. Although the existing porosities would indicate that the effective depth of X-ray penetration is smaller than the measured dimensions of the sample, computed attenuated length is 0.44  μm. As a side note, attenuated length is a computed value using Beer’s law, and {{it is used to}} indicate optimal transmission image contrast, and it is defined as the total penetration depth at which X-ray transmission is equal to 1 /e, or 36.8  %. From the tomogram of the sample Fig.  1 b, {{it is easy to see}} detect many instances when the X-ray penetration exceeds the attenuated length, which would contribute to a loss of information in the reconstruction. Third is the limited depth of focus. For this particular setting of the optics, the calculated DOF is 2.6  μm for a 510  eV incident beam and 40  nm <b>outer</b> zone <b>width.</b> The DOF is less than the thickness of the sample, and additionally insufficient considering that mechanical limitations of the equipment cause the axis of rotation to shift few microns during the course of its rotation. The deviation from the sample’s position away from its ideal FP was evident during data acquisition when portions of the particle were clearly out of focus. This would certainly impose errors during reconstruction.|$|R
