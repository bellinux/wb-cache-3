5|$|The kakapo has a {{well-developed}} {{sense of}} smell, which complements its nocturnal lifestyle. It can distinguish between odours while foraging, a behaviour reported {{in only one}} other parrot species. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> characteristics of the kakapo is its distinct musty-sweet odour. Given their well-developed sense of smell, this odour may be a pheromone. The smell often alerts predators {{to the presence of}} kakapos.|$|E
5|$|At times, when a {{new king}} came to power, old stelae would be respectfully buried and {{replaced}} with new ones, or they might be broken. When a Maya city was invaded by a rival, it was pillaged by the victors. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> archaeological markers of such an invasion is {{the destruction of the}} defeated city's stelae, which were broken and cast down. At the end of the Preclassic, around 150 AD, this fate appears to have befallen the important city of El Mirador, where most of the stelae were found smashed.|$|E
5|$|Observations made on Director's Discretionary Time {{are exempt}} from the {{proprietary}} period, and are {{released to the public}} immediately. Calibration data such as flat fields and dark frames are also publicly available straight away. All data in the archive is in the FITS format, which is suitable for astronomical analysis but not for public use. The Hubble Heritage Project processes and releases to the public a small selection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> images in JPEG and TIFF formats.|$|E

50|$|Expedition Trail (熱帶雨林探險徑) - A {{walk-through}} rainforest exhibits where, {{visitors can}} meet some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> tropical species, including the kinkajou, capybara, green anaconda and green aracari.|$|R
50|$|Light has {{profound}} {{effects on}} <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> plants. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> effects <b>of</b> light are observed when a germinating seedling {{emerges from the}} soil and is exposed to light for the first time.|$|R
5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> pieces {{is a large}} dish {{weighing}} , in {{the centre}} {{of which is a}} relief depiction of the Last Supper. Around the edge at the top, bottom and sides are four engravings of biblical scenes: the Washing of the Feet, the Walk to Emmaus, the Coming of the Holy Ghost, and Christ's Commission to the Apostles, divided by scrolls of foliage. Made by London goldsmith Henry Greenway in 1664 for the Duke of York and later acquired by CharlesII, it stands on the high altar during the coronation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Today {{there is}} {{widespread}} agreement among archaeologists that the world's first art and symbolic culture dates to the southern African Middle Stone Age. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> artifacts, including engraved pieces of red ochre, were manufactured at Blombos Cave in South Africa 70 ka. Pierced and ochred Nassarius shell beads were also recovered from Blombos, with even earlier examples (Middle Stone Age, Aterian) from the Taforalt Caves. Arrows and hide working tools have been found at Sibudu Cave as evidence of making weapons with compound heat treated gluing technology.|$|E
5|$|Galveston's {{attitudes toward}} race were at times {{unique in the}} region. The strict segregationalist attitudes {{prevalent}} {{in many parts of}} the U.S. were not always as stark in Galveston's society as in some other parts of Texas. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> examples of this was the gradual establishment of biracial labor unions of waterfront workers beginning in the 19th century, although eventually this alliance fell victim to segregationist influence. Racist ideology was always an ever-present factor in the city, however, as evinced by the name of the group which ran the Mardi Gras, the Kotton Karnival Kids (KKK, the same initials as the Ku Klux Klan).|$|E
50|$|CU Amiga {{scored the}} game 89% and noted <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game maps. There are over 1500 screens over the five levels. The {{magazine}} {{said this was}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> games <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> features.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{next wave}} <b>of</b> monastic reform {{came with the}} Cistercian Movement. The first Cistercian abbey was founded in 1098, at Cîteaux Abbey. <b>The</b> keynote <b>of</b> Cistercian life was {{a return to a}} literal {{observance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Benedictine rule, rejecting <b>the</b> developments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Benedictines. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> feature in <b>the</b> reform was the return to manual labour, and especially to field-work.|$|R
50|$|A few {{kilometers}} {{northeast of}} Mexico City stands <b>the</b> ancient site <b>of</b> Teotihuacan. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> structure <b>of</b> Teotihuacan is <b>the</b> towering Pyramid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun. The pyramid contained considerable amounts of mica in layers up to 30 cm thick.|$|R
5|$|Pursuit of {{specific}} and narrow {{areas of interest}} is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> possible features of AS. Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names, without necessarily having a genuine understanding of the broader topic. For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography. This behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6. Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused, and often dominate social interaction {{so much that the}} entire family may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Vargas Llosa {{was elected}} {{as a member}} of the Peruvian Academy of Language, a {{membership}} he still holds today. That year, he also published Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (La tía Julia y el escribidor), based in part on his marriage to his first wife, Julia Urquidi, to whom he dedicated the novel. She later wrote a memoir, Lo que Varguitas no dijo (What Little Vargas Didn't Say), in which she gives her personal account of their relationship. She states that Vargas Llosa's account exaggerates many negative points in their courtship and marriage while minimizing her role of assisting his literary career. Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter is considered one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> examples of how the language and imagery of popular culture can be used in literature. The novel was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, Tune in Tomorrow.|$|E
25|$|The {{industry}} underwent some quite radical changes, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> {{of which}} was much greater specialisation of credit. The range of banking services on offer expanded uninterruptedly.|$|E
50|$|Nintendo Life {{gave the}} game an 8.0/10 saying that Sakura Samurai: Art <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sword {{may not be}} the prettiest game on the eShop but it sure is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> challenging, <b>striking</b> a good balance between {{difficulty}} and precision.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> scenery <b>of</b> Glen Canyon Park is also {{distinguished}} by numerous large outcrops <b>of</b> rock. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> <b>of</b> these consist of reddish, layered [...] "Franciscan" [...] chert. These outcrops have clearly visible banding (see photo) which {{is due to}} <b>the</b> different weathering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> layers.|$|R
50|$|Bulovka Hospital (Nemocnice Na Bulovce) {{is a large}} {{teaching}} hospital complex in Prague, situated on a hillock adjoining the White Rock in Prague 8 - Libeň near <b>the</b> defunct homestead <b>of</b> Bulovka. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> building in <b>the</b> complex is the hospital's famous neo-Rococo building called Vychovatelna.|$|R
25|$|Music is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> {{features}} of Minas Gerais {{and has been}} part of the history of the state since the early 16th and 17th centuries.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> {{applications}} of systoles {{is in the}} context of the Schottky problem, by P.Buser and P.Sarnak, who distinguished the Jacobians of Riemann surfaces among principally polarized abelian varieties, laying the foundation for systolic arithmetic.|$|E
25|$|This {{black on}} black {{building}} is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> office buildings in New Zealand. Wanting a “symbol of endeavour”, {{key members of}} the BNZ development team travelled with Stephenson & Turner Architects to study the best current high-rise thinking around the world, including major architectural centres of the USA, Europe and Australia.|$|E
50|$|St. Simeon Monastery, a 6th-century giant {{structure}} {{built on}} a desolate hill 18 km south <b>of</b> Antakya. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> features <b>of</b> this monastery are cisterns, storage compartment and the walls. It is believed that St. Simeon lived here for 45 years on a 20-meter stone column.|$|R
50|$|Ponte City is {{the tallest}} {{residential}} building in Johannesburg and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> urban landmarks. It {{was designed by}} architect Rodney Grosskopff (who also designed other South African landmarks such as the Johannesburg Civic Theatre) and completed in 1975.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to expressive cascading forms, facades {{are characterized by}} <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> contrasting materials - robust, brown-red stone from Kosjerić and white marble slabs from <b>the</b> island <b>of</b> Brač. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> visual motif representing the window bars on the facades, designed in <b>the</b> spirit <b>of</b> late modernism.|$|R
25|$|The Docklands' {{redevelopment}} has, however, {{had some}} less beneficial aspects. The massive property boom and consequent rise in house prices {{has led to}} friction between the new arrivals and the old Docklands communities, who have complained of being squeezed out. It has also made for some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> disparities to be seen anywhere in Britain: luxury executive flats constructed alongside run-down public housing estates.|$|E
25|$|Voyager 2 {{found that}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> effects of the {{sideways}} orientation of Uranus is {{the effect on the}} tail of the planetary magnetic field. This is itself tilted about 60° from the Uranian axis of rotation. The planet's magneto tail was shown to be twisted by the rotation of Uranus into a long corkscrew shape following the planet. The presence of a significant magnetic field for Uranus was not at all known until Voyager 2s arrival.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> {{features}} of Shad Thames are the walkways which criss-cross the street high overhead. Most {{of them now}} connect the Butlers Wharf building and the Cardamom Building, and were originally used as bridges to roll barrels and the like between warehouses. They are now used as balconies by the adjoining flats. Photographs from the early 20th century show that {{at the peak of}} warehouse usage there were many more of these bridges than survive today.|$|E
60|$|Hybrids and mongrels present, {{with the}} one great {{exception}} <b>of</b> fertility, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> accordance in all other respects; namely, in <b>the</b> laws <b>of</b> their resemblance to their two parents, in their tendency to reversion, in their variability, and in being absorbed through repeated crosses by either parent- form.|$|R
50|$|FC {{acquired}} number <b>of</b> famous players, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> were international stars Roberto Carlos and Samuel Eto'o from Inter Milan, Yuri Zhirkov from FC Chelsea.|$|R

25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> of Socotra's {{plants is}} the dragon's blood tree (Dracaena cinnabari), {{which is a}} strange-looking, umbrella-shaped tree. Its red sap {{was thought to be}} the dragon's blood of the ancients, sought after as a dye, and today used as paint and varnish. Also {{important}} in ancient times were Socotra's various endemic aloes, used medicinally, and for cosmetics. Other endemic plants include the giant succulent tree Dorstenia gigas, the cucumber tree Dendrosicyos socotranus, the rare Socotran pomegranate (Punica protopunica), Aloe perryi, and Boswellia socotrana.|$|E
25|$|The 1986 LeSabre was {{introduced}} {{on the new}} front wheel drive H platform, after departing from rear wheel drive on the GM B platform. Joining the LeSabre on the H-body included the Oldsmobile Delta 88 and the 1987 Pontiac Bonneville, which returned to full-size after a short-lived run as a mid-size on the G platform. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> features of the LeSabre version of the H-body was the hood was hinged towards the front instead of towards the back near the cowl and windshield {{in the same fashion}} as that of the Buick Electra and Chevrolet Corvette of that era.|$|E
25|$|After some {{decades of}} being mostly {{forgotten}} and occupied mainly by poorer farmers, tourism has since given the village a modest income. With a partial {{contribution to the}} costs from the European Union, some 26 of the traditional creole villas were restored. As the only village on the island it is, since 1999, a member of Les Plus Beaux Villages de France ('The most beautiful villages in France'), an award given to about 150 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> small communities in France. In connection with the requirements for the award, there are few to no visible modern elements like telephone or power poles in the village.|$|E
40|$|During 1976, Southern Africa has {{significantly}} increased its literary output, and this bibliography has considerably more entries {{than that of}} any previous year. There is a variety <b>of</b> reasons, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> <b>of</b> which is ’the Lessing phenomenon’; almost a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bibliography is devoted to her. In hi...|$|R
50|$|The Hawaiian sugar {{strike of}} 1946 was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{expensive}} <b>strikes</b> in history. This strike involved almost all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plantations in Hawaii, creating {{a cost of}} over $15 million in crop and production. This strike would become one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading causes for social change throughout the territory.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town's <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> images, in {{addition}} to the castle, is <b>the</b> group <b>of</b> three tower blocks <b>of</b> flats near <b>the</b> town centre. The first two blocks were built in the 1960s and named Bolingbroke Heights and Richard Heights, with a third, Castle Heights, added shortly afterwards.|$|R
