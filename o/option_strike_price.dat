And one manufacturer provides the high wholesale price with low supply disruption risk {{and the other is}} completely the opposite. This differs from the previous supply chain coordination model. Firstly, supply disruption is added to the three-echelon supply chain. Secondly, considering the coordination of the supply chain, we deploy the combined option and back contracts which are seldom used in the previous study. Furthermore, it is interesting that supply disruption risk and buyback factor do not affect the distributor’s order quantity from the manufacturer who has low product price and unreliable operating ability, while the order quantity increases with the rise of option premium and <b>option</b> <b>strike</b> <b>price.</b> The distributor’s order quantity from the manufacturer, which has high product price and reliable operating ability, increases with the rise of supply disruption risk but decreases when the buyback factor, option premium, and <b>option</b> <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> decrease...|$|E

30|$|Note that a {{producer}} that sells its {{production in the}} pool during the two hours of the study horizon {{does not have any}} contracting obligation to sell electricity. In contrast, as previously discussed, selling electricity through a forward contract necessarily involves the purchase of the agreed energy in the pool during those time steps in which the generating unit is forced out. For this reason, in this example, we consider a power producer that sells its production through a forward contract spanning the second hour, whose price is fixed to the average pool price during this period (18.75 €/MWh), and that evaluates the possibility of acquiring a call option to reduce the financial losses associated with unexpected unit failures. In doing so, if scenarios characterized by unit failures and high pool prices are likely, the producer generally exercises the option to buy electricity at a lower price. In this example, the <b>option</b> <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> is set to be 15 €/MWh (a price higher than the unit production cost and lower than the forward contract price) and its option price is set to be 0.1 €/MWh for illustration purposes.|$|E

The spread between the <b>option</b> <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> and the market value of the stock impacts the likelihood of repricing. This effect is enhanced when the CEO is the Chairman of the Board. Firm and CEO visibility, having more board members appointed after the CEO, having a classified board, and higher percentages of CEO and institutional ownership reduce the impact of spread on the likelihood of repricing. 2 For years agency theorists have argued that the use of long-term compensation tools such as stock options serve as effective mechanisms to align management's interests with those of shareholders (e. g., Fama & Jensen, 1983; Jensen & Meckling, 1976).

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with improving option-pricing accuracy. The seminal option-pricing model is the Black-Scholes model (Black and Scholes 1973). Claims that the Black-Scholes valuation model no longer holds are appearing with increasing frequency (Dumas et al. 1996). In fact, Rubinstein (1985) states that, {{not only is the}} model failing, it is becoming worse over time. The failure of the conventional model has motivated a new option-pricing literature, determined to reconcile these pricing anomalies. Those approaches that hold the most promise make minimal assumptions. Some authors assume that the key to improving pricing lies with modeling the underlying standard deviation (Ait-Sahalia and Lo 1 998, Dumas et al. 1996, and Ncube 1996). Others use techniques to fit optimal distributions implied by option prices (Rubinstein 1994, Derman and Kani 1994, and White 1995). This work shows that significant pricing outperformance is possible with a new hybrid approach. The hybrid approach models the differences between the conventional option-pricing model and the actual transactional data. The conventional pricing model has only one unknown input parameter [...] -the standard deviation. Although the market's optimal forecast for standard deviation is utilized, persistent and systematic biases are found. The biases are a function of the option's moneyness (ie, ratio of underlying value to <b>option</b> <b>strike</b> <b>price)</b> and time to maturity. These biases are modeled with artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs are a form of nonlinear, nonparametric regression. It is found that this modeling out-of-sample option-pricing performance.

40|$|From a {{financial}} economic perspective, the governing condition of a meritorious civil action is {{the uncertainty of}} outcome. Expectation and outcome deviate, and the spread is the measure of uncertainty (or variance). During litigation each party has an option to settle or select trial. The decision standard {{can be seen as}} an <b>option</b> <b>strike</b> <b>price</b> and a finding of liability as an “in-the-money” call option. This apparent optionality suggests the application of an option pricing model to legal valuation, and a small but growing body of scholarship endorses this concept. However, option theory is not the only concept. Under an asset pricing model, the value of an asset is the sum of its expected cashflow discounted by its risk. Uncertainty is the key variable in the values of an option and an asset, but risk has a bipolar effect on value. Greater risk increases option value, but decreases asset value. At issue is the essential nature of a disputed right: is a lawsuit conceptually an option or an asset? This article argues that the essential nature of a lawsuit is best viewed as an asset. Uncertainty diminishes lawsuit value consistent with the prediction of asset pricing principles. This article shows that expected value, which has been a durable concept in law and economic literature, does not equal true economic value. The assumption of risk neutrality assumes away the most difficult aspect of the valuational analysis and fails to account for a risk-adjusted discount reflecting the quality of the forecast. Thus, two cases with the same expected value are not valuational equivalents if the variance of returns is perceived differently, and this article analyzes how parties account for different perceptions of risk in valuation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a frequency distribution method for valuing European and American arithmetic average options on a discrete time, recombining multiplicative binomial stock price process. The method can value instruments with either time weighted or time unweighted averages, calculated using all or only some time points. The procedure first involves developing, for each possible ending price, a frequency {{distribution of the}} nodes through which all the paths ending at that price will pass. The set of paths associated with each ending price is called a bundle; at time T there are T + I bundles in a recombining binomial tree. Frequency data for all the nodes attained by the paths in any bundle is obtained analytically, as are each bundle’s maximum and minimum path averages. In any given bundle, the path averages may all exceed the <b>option</b> <b>strike</b> <b>price,</b> may all be less, or may lie both above and below it. Each bundle type is easily identified by its maximum and minimum path averages. Determining {{the contribution of the}} first two types of bundle to option value is immediate, but assessing the contribution of the third type, called a mixed bundle, requires further calculation to determine the conditional frequency distribution for the subset of paths whose averages exceed (fall below) the strike price of a call (put). Finally, using the (original or conditional) frequency distributions for each bundle, the means (or conditional means) of path averages can be computed and the option evaluated using them. This paper derives the analytic formulae and shows how the necessary subsidiary calculations can be done. Approximation methods are also discussed. 717 R&sum 6 Solutions rapides aux options de moyenne arithmktique sur un modele stochastique de recombinaiso...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates implied {{volatility}} in general classes of stock price models. To begin with, {{we take a}} very general view. We find that {{implied volatility}} is always, everywhere, and for every expiry well-defined only if the stock price is a non-negative martingale. We also derive sufficient and close to necessary conditions for an implied volatility surface {{to be free from}} static arbitrage. In this context, free from static arbitrage means that the call price surface generated by the implied volatility surface is free from static arbitrage. We also investigate the small time to expiry behaviour of implied volatility. We do this in almost complete generality, assuming only that the call price surface is non-decreasing and right continuous in time to expiry and that the call surface satisfies the no-arbitrage bounds (S-K) +&# 8804; C(K, &# 964;) &# 8804; S. We used S to denote the current stock price, K to be a <b>option</b> <b>strike</b> <b>price,</b> &# 964; denotes time to expiry, and C(K, &# 964;) the price of the K strike option expiring in &# 964; time units. Under these weak assumptions, we obtain exact asymptotic formulae relating the call price surface and the implied volatility surface close to expiry. We apply our general asymptotic formulae to determining the small time to expiry behaviour of implied volatility in a variety of models. We consider exponential Lévy models, obtaining new and somewhat surprising results. We then investigate the behaviour close to expiry of stochastic volatility models in the at-the-money case. Our results generalise what is already known and by a novel method of proof. In the not at-the-money case, we consider local volatility models using classical results of Varadhan. In obtaining the asymptotics for local volatility models, we use a representation of the European call as an integral over time to expiry. We devote an entire chapter to representations of the European call option; a key role is played by local time and the argument of Klebaner. A novel alternative that is especially useful in the local volatility case is also presented...|$|E

Stronger managerial incentives to invest can benefit or harm a firm. Our results should send a cautionary signal to researchers who study managerial behavior.
