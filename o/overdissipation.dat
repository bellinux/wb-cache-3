40|$|This paper reconsiders Tullock's {{analysis}} of rent seeking and wasteful <b>overdissipation.</b> The {{purpose of this}} paper is to point out that even though his original {{analysis of}} <b>overdissipation</b> is technically flawed, the definition of <b>overdissipation</b> can be modified to explain instances in which rational rent-seekers spend more to win a prize than the prize is worth. We showed before that equilibrium mixed strategies in the Tullock game do not permit <b>overdissipation</b> in expectation: the expected total amount spent competing for rents cannot exceed the value of the prize. However, since the equilibrium involves mixed-strategies for particular realizations of the mixed strategies the total amount spent competing for rents can exceed the value of the prize! In fact, we show that the cross-sectional incidence of <b>overdissipation</b> may be quite high. For a symmetric perfectly discriminating contest (R = &inf;), the probability of <b>overdissipation</b> in a symmetric equilibrium ranges from exactly one-half in the two player case to approximately. 44 as the number of players approaches infinity...|$|E
40|$|We study {{evolutionarily}} stable strategy (ESS) in contests where {{participation is}} stochastic. When participation probabilities are given, players exert more effort In ESS than under Nash.

When entry is costly and endogenous, players 2 ̆ 019 entry is more likely, more costly, and less profitable in ESS than under Nash.

40|$|In this paper, we {{show how}} endogenously {{determined}} intrinsic mo- tivation a¤ects the rents dissipated in a contest. If players just add an intrinsic benet to their {{taking part in}} the contest, then in the unique Nash equilibrium all players activate their intrinsic motivation. Most important, if the intrinsic value players attach to their {{taking part in the}} contest is su¢ ciently high, <b>overdissipation</b> of rents occurs. If, however, players maximize a weighted sum of extrinsic and intrinsic payo¤s, they deactive their intrinsic motivation and <b>overdissipation</b> of rents does not occur. ...|$|E
40|$|We analyze equilibria of two-player {{contests}} where {{players have}} intention-based preferences. We find that players invest more effort {{compared to the}} case with selfish preferences and are even willing to exert effort when the monetary value of the prize converges to zero. As a consequence, <b>overdissipation</b> occurs if {{the value of the}} prize is sufficiently small...|$|E
40|$|Most {{articles}} on sports economics presume the well-known Nash equilibrium concept. In this article, however, we apply evolutionary game theory in a sports-contest model. If clubs follow evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS), then ESS generate greater investments and smaller profits than predicted by Nash’s strategies, independent {{of whether a}} club is win-maximizing or profit-maximizing. <b>Overdissipation</b> of the rent is possible for Nash strategies and for ESS...|$|E
40|$|Tullock’s {{analysis}} of rent-seeking is reconsidered from an evolutionary point of view. We show that evolutionarily stable {{behavior in a}} rent-seeking contest differs from efficient rent-seeking behavior in a Nash equilibrium. We explore that implications of evolutionary stability for rent-seeking behavior and relate them to the well examined Nash equilibrium behavior. A most interesting result is an <b>overdissipation</b> law, which holds in evolutionary equilibrium. ...|$|E
40|$|Any {{symmetric}} mixed-strategy equilibrium in a Tullock {{contest with}} intermediate {{values of the}} decisiveness parameter (" 2 < R < 9 ") has countably infinitely many mass points. All probability weight is concentrated on those mass points, which have the zero bid as their sole point of accumulation. With contestants randomizing over a non-convex set, there is a cost of being "halfhearted," which is absent from both the lottery contest and the all-pay auction. Numerical bid distributions are generally negatively skewed, and exhibit, for some parameter values, a higher probability of ex-post <b>overdissipation</b> than the all-pay auction...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates a long-run {{equilibrium}} of the Tullock contest {{using an}} evolutionary game-theoretic approach. The finite population evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) yields <b>overdissipation</b> of rent {{when there are}} increasing returns to expenditure. However, imitative behavior, {{considered to be a}} source of the evolutionary dynamics behind the ESS, is implausible because individual rationality is not always satisfied. In this paper, we attempt to specify such implicit imitative behavior and construct explicit evolutionary dynamics. Under our plausible imitation rule, we show that full dissipation may prevail in the long run as long as there are increasing returns...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the recent}} years, many {{clubs in the}} biggest European soccer leagues have run into debts. The sports {{economic}} literature provides several explanation for this development, e. g., the league structure (open versus closed league), club constitutions, ruinous rat races between clubs. While {{the majority of the}} articles presume the well-known Nash equilibrium concept, I apply evolutionary game theory in a sports contest model. If clubs follow evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS), then ESS generate higher investments and lower profits than predicted by Nash strategies independent of win maximizing or profit maximizing clubs. <b>Overdissipation</b> of the rent is possible for Nash strategies as well as for ESS. Contest, evolutionary stable strategies, utility maximization, team sports league...|$|E
40|$|In Tullock's {{rent-seeking}} model, {{the probability}} a player wins the game depends on expenditures {{raised to the}} power R. We show that a symmetric mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium exists when R> 2, and that <b>overdissipation</b> of rents does not arise in any Nash equilibrium. We derive a tight lower bound {{on the level of}} rent dissipation that arises in a symmetric equilibrium when the strategy space is discrete, and show that full rent dissipation occurs when the strategy space is continuous. Our results are shown to be consistent with recent experimental evidence on the dissipation of rents.

40|$|We {{study which}} factors {{in terms of}} trading {{environment}} and trader characteristics determine individual information acquisition in experimental asset markets. Traders with larger endowments, existing inconclusive information, lower risk aversion, and less experience in financial markets tend to acquire more information. Overall, we find that traders overacquire information, so that informed traders on average obtain negative profits net of information costs. Information acquisition and the associated losses do not diminish over time. This overacquisition phenomenon is inconsistent with predictions of rational expectations equilibrium, and we argue it resembles the <b>overdissipation</b> results from the contest literature. We find that more acquired information in the market leads to smaller differences between fundamental asset values and prices. Thus, the overacquisition phenomenon is a novel explanation for the high forecasting accuracy of prediction markets...|$|E
40|$|Bidding {{behavior}} in all-pay auctions {{is well documented}} as deviating from the Nash predictions. In particular, there is pervasive and significant overbidding {{not only in terms}} of the aggregate groups bids being greater than the value of the prize, but also by individuals placing bids that guarantee them to earn negative profit. In this paper, we conduct a series of experiments in order to attempt to provide behavioral explanations for these bidding strategies. We find that individual agents are not especially strategically motivated, but rather we believe that non-monetary incentives play a significant role. Another critical factor in overbidding is the framing of the earnings. If earnings are presented in a positive manner instead of negatively as in the standard all-pay auction framework, then aggregate <b>overdissipation</b> can be eliminated in the long run...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{explore how}} models of boundedly {{rational}} decision-making in games {{can explain the}} <b>overdissipation</b> of rents in laboratory Tullock contest games. Using {{a new series of}} experiments in which group size is varied across sessions, we find that models based on logit choice organize the data well. In this setting, logit quantal response equilibrium (QRE) is a limit of a cognitive hierarchy (CH) model with logit best responses for appropriate parameters. While QRE captures the data well, the CH fits provide support for relaxing the equilibrium assumption. Both the QRE and CH models have parameters which capture boundedness of rationality. The maximum likelihood fits of both models yield parameters indicating rationality is more restricted as group size grows.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{investigate the}} effect of social identification and information feedback on individual behavior in contests. Identifying subjects through photo display decreases efforts. Providing information feedback about others ’ effort {{does not affect the}} aggregate effort levels but it does change the dynamics of individual behavior. We develop a behavioral model based on relative payoff maximization, and use it to estimate the degree of pro-social/status-seeking behavior. We find that decrease in ‘social distance ’ between group members through photo display promotes pro-social behavior. Information feedback reduces the within-group volatility in effort level and facilitates greater adherence to the ‘group norm. ’ Finally, in contrast to standard theoretical predictions, we find significant over-expenditure of efforts in all treatments. This <b>overdissipation</b> can be explained by a combination of non-monetary utility of winning an...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study {{formation}} of support and opposition to redistribution. We analyze a society with two groups of citizens and a government. The government distributes income from one group to the other in response to political pressure. The interaction between the groups is modeled as a two-stage game. In stage 1, the groups decide if they want to be politically active. In stage 2, the active group or groups seek influence on the direction and size of the transfer. We demonstrate that supporters of redistribution are always politically active but that opposition is often absent. Moreover, when opposition is absent there is a strong tendency for underdissipation of the transfer, while political competition typically leads to <b>overdissipation.</b> Copyright 2002 Blackwell Publishers Ltd [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} hybrid contests where participants commit {{two types}} of resources to improve their probability of winning the prize. The first type is forfeited ex ante, before the prize is allocated, by winners and losers alike, while the second is committed ex ante by all contenders but expended ex post, after the prize is allocated, and only by the contestant that wins the prize. The model yields a number of interesting results. Among them is the finding that, {{as the number of}} contestants increases, the ex ante expenditures of individual contestants decrease while the ex post expenditure increases. Even more interesting, the total of the ex ante and ex post expenditures by the contenders in a hybrid contest may decrease with the number of competitors. The study also finds that there is no rent <b>overdissipation,</b> and compares the total expenditures in the contest and “all-pay” allocation mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|We analyze Nash equilibria of {{share and}} {{probabilistic}} contests when players have distributional preferences. If players are sufficiently similar, distributional preferences create multiple equilibria. For {{the case of}} only mildly heterogeneous players, equilibrium effort can be lower as well as higher than effort with standard, selfish preferences. These findings can explain three anomalies in empirical tests of the probabilistic prize-seeking game, namely the large variance of effort levels (overspreading), individual spending that exceeds the Nash-equilibrium prediction (overspending), and aggregate spending that exceeds {{the value of the}} prize (<b>overdissipation),</b> and they are also in line with the findings for share contests. If players are sufficiently heterogeneous, the game has a unique equilibrium that is more egalitarian than the standard, selfish Nash equilibrium. It turns out that the less talented competitor may win the larger share of the prize if his inequality aversion is sufficiently strong. We analyze how the equilibria evolve if the number of players gets larger and how sequential moves influence behavior. Two new insights follow from the analysis of the sequential-move game. First, sequential moves act as a coordination device if there are multiple simultaneous equilibria, and second the inequality aversion of the more egalitarian player {{can be used as a}} commitment device for low effort. This effect can reverse the conventional wisdom that the underdog should lead...|$|E
