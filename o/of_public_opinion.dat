In this paper, we define the “netizen acceptance degree” in cases of some social hot topics as the payoff in factor games, and build the evolutionary equation <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>opinions,</b> which is the infectious diseases diffusion model with changing population size. After that, we apply the theoretical model to the evolutionary course of pubic opinions in a real Internet emergency case, i. e., the “ 10. 24 Self-sacrifice Event” in China.

5|$|A new Prisons Act {{was passed}} in 1981, which updated the 1903 act and its eleven {{amendments}} with modern philosophies and practices – codifying departmental orders, instructions, and policy documents. The act was, however, slanted towards prisoner management and safety, as the government and opposition were mindful <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>opinion,</b> {{and the perception of}} lax security at Fremantle. The result was legislation criticised by the Criminal Lawyers Association, academics, and newspapers, including for minimal welfare provisions that did little to ensure prisoner welfare. The department was at the same time renamed the Prisons Department once more, to emphasise imprisonment as its primary responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the great}} {{quantity}} and excellent {{quality of the}} fossil material, Plateosaurus {{was for a long}} time one of the most misunderstood dinosaurs. Some researchers proposed theories that were later shown to conflict with geological and palaeontological evidence, but have become the paradigm <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>opinion.</b> Since 1980 the taxonomy (relationships), taphonomy (how the animals became embedded and fossilized), biomechanics (how their skeletons worked), and palaeobiology (life circumstances) of Plateosaurus have been re-studied in detail, altering the interpretation of the animal's biology, posture and behaviour.|$|E
40|$|The {{forecast}} <b>of</b> online <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> {{is a kind}} {{of complex}} forecasting problem with information, small sample and uncertainty. In order to improve the accuracy for the forecast <b>of</b> online <b>public</b> <b>opinion,</b> a new forecasting method based on a gray model and a support vector machine is proposed.

5|$|Due to {{the limited}} form of {{judicial}} review available under the ISA, whether a person remains under detention depends largely on the Ministry of Home Affairs. This raises the question quis custodiet ipsos custodes? – who guards the guardians?

It has been submitted that the voice <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> is most suited for this purpose.|$|E

The following year he submitted a publisher's proposal for The Secret War, a full account of deception during the Second World War, but was prevented from writing it by the Official Secrets Act. His final book was fiction, a thriller entitled Golden Arrow, published in 1955.|$|E

She was criticized for her relative absence in XIII-2. Her role in Lightning Returns had a mixed reception: some critics saw her as underdeveloped and unlikable, while others found her better developed and more human than in previous games. Lightning later appeared on lists, compiled by video game publications, of the best characters in the Final Fantasy series and in video games as a whole. She has been received favorably in polls <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> by Famitsu, Square Enix, and other organizations.|$|E

5|$|A Peronist, Kirchner handled {{political}} power as Peronist leaders have traditionally done. He nevertheless sought to portray himself as being different from previous Peronist leaders. He made {{frequent use of}} controversies with other political or social forces and the polarization <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>opinion,</b> which became characteristic of his political style. This strategy was used against the financial sector, the military and police, foreign countries, international bodies, newspapers, and Duhalde himself {{with varying degrees of}} success. Kirchner sought to generate an image contrasting with those of former presidents Carlos Menem and Fernando de la Rúa. Menem was seen as frivolous and De la Rúa as doubtful, so Kirchner tried to be seen as serious and determined.|$|E
5|$|Democracy {{essentially}} means {{rule of the}} people. To build {{a democratic}} society and rule, there must be citizen participation by an informed electorate. The freedom to speak and express is thus crucial for the formation <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> on political questions, and is indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth. In Singapore, the right to {{freedom of speech and}} expression is guaranteed to citizens by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, though it is subject to many qualifications. Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right as it considers necessary or expedient {{in the interest of the}} security of Singapore, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality, and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence.|$|E
5|$|Following on {{from the}} site selection, the Scottish Office {{announced}} that an international competition would be held to find a designer for a new building to house the Parliament. A design committee was appointed under the chairmanship of Dewar, and was tasked with choosing from a shortlist of designs. Proposals were submitted from internationally renowned architects such as Rafael Viñoly, Michael Wilford and Richard Meier. Twelve designs were selected in March 1998, which were whittled down to five by the following May. The five final designs were put on public display throughout Scotland in June 1998. Feedback from the public displays showed that the designs of the Spanish architect Enric Miralles were amongst the most popular. The design team took account <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> on the designs and invited all five shortlisted entrants to make presentations on their proposed designs before announcing a winner.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1859, PedroII {{departed}} {{on a trip to}} provinces {{north of}} the capital, visiting Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco and Paraíba. He returned in February 1860 after four months. The trip was a huge success, with the Emperor welcomed everywhere with warmth and joy. The first half of the 1860s saw peace and prosperity in Brazil. Civil liberties were maintained. Freedom of speech had existed since Brazil's independence and was strongly defended by PedroII. He found newspapers from the capital and from the provinces an ideal way to keep track <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> and the nation's overall situation. Another means of monitoring the Empire was through direct contacts with his subjects. One opportunity for this was during regular Tuesday and Saturday public audiences, where anyone of any social class, including slaves, could gain admittance and present their petitions and stories. Visits to schools, colleges, prisons, exhibitions, factories, barracks and other public appearances presented further opportunities to gather first-hand information.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{continued}} use of the name {{has come from the}} team's owners and a majority of fans, which include some Native Americans. Supporters say that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans, and that it is not intended in a negative manner. Some, such as team president Bruce Allen, also point to the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a majority of Native American students. Supporters have asserted that a majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> polling. In May 2016, the Washington Post published a poll that duplicated the central question posed in 2004, yielding an identical result.|$|E
5|$|In {{what was}} seen to have {{promoted}} anti-incumbency, a scandal regarding campaign finance followed allegation that the Centre Party's Timo Kalli's, who was also {{the head of the}} party's parliamentary group, admission in early May 2009 that he violated the law on reporting electoral campaign financing by not disclosing financial contributions he received for his election campaign during the previous election in 2007. When the media then delved further into the issue, stories started to emerge of common practice with a multitude of MPs not disclosing their financial benefactors, a practice which was not punishable under Finnish law. The media investigations focused on a group of entrepreneurs called Kehittyvien Maakuntien Suomi (Finland of Developing Provinces) who financed the electoral campaigns of numerous high-profile government and opposition candidates. Further investigations revealed that many recipients of their financial support did not register or even mention the amounts they received from the group. Then Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen was {{at the core of the}} accusations after the investigations showed he had also been among the beneficiaries of the groups' financing; this was despite one of the members of the group who had planned to build the biggest shopping mall in the country received Vanhanen's support for the plans against the grain <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>opinion,</b> thus eliciting accusations that he could have been influenced by the individual. Blame was also put on the Centre Party's secretary Jarmo Korhonen. This was said to have helped the True Finns.|$|E
