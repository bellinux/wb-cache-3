The novel gantry design that is described here is made of fixed field superconducting magnets, thus dramatically reducing magnet size and weight compared to conventional magnets.

The beam line is built of combined-function dipoles such as a nonscaling fixed field alternating gradient (NS-FFAG) structure. The very large momentum acceptance NS-FFAG comes from very strong focusing and very small dispersion. The NS-FFAG small magnets almost completely filled the beam line.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. This thesis describes the design of novel magnetic lattices for the transport line and <b>gantry</b> <b>of</b> a charged particle therapy complex. The designs use non-scaling Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (ns-FFAG) magnets and were made {{as part of the}} PAMELA project. The main contributions in this thesis are the near-perfect FFAG dispersion suppression design process and the designs of the transport line and the gantry lattices. The primary challenge when designing an FFAG gantry is that particles with different momenta take up different lateral positions within the magnets. This is called dispersion and causes problems at three points: the entrance to the gantry, which must be rotated without distortion of the beam; at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gantry</b> where reduced dispersion is required for entry to the scanning system; and {{a third of the way}} through the gantry, where a switch in curvature of the magnets is required. Due to their non-linear fields, dispersion suppression in conventional FFAGs is never perfect. However, as this thesis shows, a solution can be found through manipulation of the field components, meaning near-perfect dispersion suppression can be achieved using ns-FFAG magnets (although at a cost of irregular optics). The design process for an FFAG dispersion suppressor shown in this thesis is a novel solution to a previously unsolved problem. Other challenges in the gantry lattice design, such as height and the control of the optics, are tackled and a final gantry design presented and discussed. The starting point for the transport line is a straight FFAG lattice design. This is optimised and matched to a 45 o bend. Fixed field solutions to the problem of extracting to the treatment room are discussed, but a time variable field solution is decided on for practical and patient safety reasons. A matching scheme into the gantry room is then designed and presented...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOne of the {{functions}} <b>of</b> a medical <b>gantry</b> is to irradiate a tumor from different angles to reduce the dose received by the healthy tissue which surrounds the tumor. The rotation <b>of</b> the <b>gantry</b> rotates also its quadrupoles that focus the beam, {{as a result the}} beam is “coupled” {{in the sense that the}} horizontal motion of the beam particles is affected by the vertical motion and vice-versa therefore the beam spot size at the tumor may vary with the angular orientation <b>of</b> the <b>gantry.</b> Although such a beam-coupling is inevitable in a rotated gantry in which the horizontal plane is not the symmetry plane of the quadrupoles, it is possible to find a solution that the optics of the gantry“appears uncoupled” at any angular orientation <b>of</b> the <b>gantry.</b> As we show in the paper, the condition <b>of</b> an uncoupled <b>gantry</b> is equivalent to an uncoupled linear-beam-transport-matrix which is independent of the angular orientation <b>of</b> the <b>gantry,</b> therefore the beam spot size at the location of the tumor is independent of the orientation <b>of</b> the <b>gantry.</b> In this paper we present the theoretical basis to generate the beam optics for a gantry which is constrained to provide uncoupled and also achromatic beamtransport to the location of the tumor. In addition we present the layout of the magnetic elements and the optics of a medical gantrywhich satisfies the achromaticity and uncoupled conditions...|$|R
40|$|We are {{presenting}} the layout and the optics of a beam line {{to be used}} as a medical gantry in radiation therapy. The optical properties <b>of</b> the <b>gantry's</b> beam line are such as to make the beam line achromatic and uncoupled. These two properties make the beam spot size, which is delivered and focused by the gantry, on the tumor of the patient, independent of the angular orientation <b>of</b> the <b>gantry.</b> In this paper we present the layout of the magnetic elements <b>of</b> the <b>gantry,</b> and also present the theoretical basis for the optics design <b>of</b> such a <b>gantry.</b> A medical gantry, as it is used in the radiation treatment of cancer patients, is the last part of the beam optical system, of the accelerator complex, which delivers and focuses the beam on the tumor. The curved line shown in figure 1 is a schematic diagram <b>of</b> a <b>gantry</b> which can rotate about a horizontal axis. The particle beam (green arrow in fig. 1) enters the gantry, and is guided by the gantry on the tumor (red spot in fig. 1). As the gantry rotates about the axis shown in figure 1, the beam exiting the gantry always lies on a plane normal to the rotation axis at the point of the icocenter. Thus the gantry facilitates the ability of the beam delivery system, to deliver the beam at the tumor, which is placed at the icocenter, from any angle on this vertical plane, which is normal to the rotation angle <b>of</b> the <b>gantry</b> as stated earlier. The <b>gantry</b> consists <b>of</b> dipoles and quadrupoles elements whose median symmetry plane lies on a plane which contains the rotation axis <b>of</b> the <b>gantry.</b> In this paper we define this plane as the 'plane of the gantry'. As the beam is transported along the axis of rotation <b>of</b> the <b>gantry</b> and before it enters the gantry, it is focused by 'normal' quadrupoles and experiences no linear beam coupling. Subsequently the beam enters the gantry, and is transported by the gantry to the delivery point which is the tumor. The transported beam at the tumor is still linearly uncoupled as long as the plane <b>of</b> the <b>gantry</b> lies either, on the horizontal, or the vertical plane. In these two orientations <b>of</b> the <b>gantry</b> the dipoles and the quadrupoles are 'normal' therefore the linear R-transport-matrix appears linearly uncoupled. As the gantry rotates about this horizontal axis, to irradiate the tumor at a different angle, the linear beam coupling is unavoidable since the coordinate system <b>of</b> the <b>gantry's</b> quadrupoles is rotated with respect to the coordinate system of the quadrupoles at the entrance <b>of</b> the <b>gantry</b> which are located along the axis of rotation. As a result, in this rotated coordinate system, the beam will be linearly coupled as it is transported by the gantry to the tumor and the beam size at the location of the tumor will vary in size depending on the orientation <b>of</b> the <b>gantry.</b> In this paper we present a method which makes the beam transport R-matrix linearly uncoupled, achromatic and independent of the orientation angle <b>of</b> the <b>gantry</b> as is proven in the following section...|$|R
