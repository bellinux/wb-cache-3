5|$|From {{early in}} the {{development}} of attachment theory there was criticism of the theory's lack of congruence with various branches <b>of</b> <b>psychoanalysis.</b> Bowlby's decisions left him open to criticism from well-established thinkers working on similar problems.|$|E
5|$|French {{psychoanalyst}} Jacques Lacan linked psychoanalysis with Kantian {{ethics in}} his works The Ethics <b>of</b> <b>Psychoanalysis</b> and Kant avec Sade and compared Kant with the Marquis de Sade. Lacan argued that Sade's maxim of jouissance—the pursuit of sexual pleasure or enjoyment—is morally acceptable by Kant's criteria {{because it can}} be universalised. He proposed that, while Kant presented human freedom as critical to the moral law, Sade further argued that human freedom is only fully realised through the maxim of jouissance.|$|E
5|$|Many of Wagner's concepts, {{including}} his speculation about dreams, predated their investigation by Sigmund Freud. Wagner had publicly analysed the Oedipus myth before Freud {{was born in}} terms of its psychological significance, insisting that incestuous desires are natural and normal, and perceptively exhibiting the relationship between sexuality and anxiety. Georg Groddeck considered the Ring as the first manual <b>of</b> <b>psychoanalysis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Greenberg, {{along with}} Stephen Mitchell, {{was one of}} the main originators <b>of</b> {{relational}} <b>psychoanalysis,</b> a new development in psychoanalysis which is in part a further development <b>of</b> interpersonal <b>psychoanalysis</b> and object relations theory. The influence remains through their book Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory and a key article in Contemporary Psychoanalysis. A complete issue <b>of</b> Contemporary <b>Psychoanalysis</b> was devoted to the much-quoted Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory in 2013, the 30th anniversary of its publication.|$|R

5|$|One of Reich's first {{patients}} was Lore Kahn, a 19-year-old woman {{with whom he}} had an affair. Freud had warned analysts not to involve themselves with their patients, but in the early days <b>of</b> <b>psychoanalysis</b> the warnings went unheeded. According to Reich's diaries, Kahn became ill in November 1920 and died of sepsis after sleeping in a bitterly cold room she had rented as a place for her and Reich to meet (both his landlady and her parents had forbidden their meetings). Kahn's mother suspected that her daughter had died after a botched illegal abortion, possibly performed by Reich himself. According to Christopher Turner, she found some of her daughter's bloodied underwear in a cupboard.|$|E
5|$|Some LGBT {{interpretations of}} popular stories and {{characters}} have been controversial. Ganeśa: Lord of obstacles, Lord of beginnings, applied psychoanalytic approaches to Hindu stories. The book stated that Ganesha's trunk represented a flaccid penis {{and his love}} of sweets indicated a desire to perform homosexual oral sex. The deductions of this book, and similar application <b>of</b> <b>psychoanalysis</b> {{to the study of}} Hinduism, has been questioned by Western and Indian academics including Antonio De Nicholas, Krishnan Ramaswamy, S.N.Balagangadhara, Saraha Claerhout, who have stated that the book is based on mistranslations and psychoanalytic misinterpretations. The book became infamous in India, triggering protests and resulting in a public apology from the publishers and withdrawal of the book in India.|$|E
