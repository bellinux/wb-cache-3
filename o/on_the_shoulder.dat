5|$|Just {{prior to}} the next day's game, a tearful Joyce met Galarraga at home plate to receive the Tigers' lineup card. The two shook hands and Joyce gave the pitcher a pat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> with a warm {{reception}} from the audience. Joyce's accountability and regret, and Galarraga's sportsmanship were widely praised for turning the unfortunate situation into a positive.|$|E
5|$|The {{supporters}} were the crowned lion of England and the unicorn of Scotland ({{as in the}} Royal Arms) charged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> with a label as in the arms. Albert's personal motto is the German Treu und Fest (Loyal and Sure). This motto was also used by Prince Albert's Own or the 11th Hussars.|$|E
5|$|As Prince of Wales, George Augustus {{bore the}} royal arms (with an inescutcheon of Gules plain in the Hanoverian quarter), differenced by a label of three points Argent. The arms {{included}} the royal crest and supporters {{but with the}} single arched coronet of his rank, all charged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> with a similar label. His arms followed {{the change in the}} royal arms in 1801, when the Hanoverian quarter became an inescutcheon and the French quarter was dropped altogether. The 1816 alteration did not affect him as it only applied to the arms of the King.|$|E

5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> of the road. Thereafter he {{frequently}} walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them that when you have done something really stupid, it is best to admit it.|$|E
5|$|Debra, who {{is staying}} at Dexter's apartment, is exercising incessantly and {{barely able to}} sleep as she struggles with {{memories}} of Brian, her ex-fiancé, trying to kill her. She returns {{to work at the}} police station; Sgt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez) expresses concern about her emotional stability, but Debra is determined to resume a normal lifestyle. When she takes Rita out to a bar, a man recognizes Debra as the fiancée of the Ice Truck Killer. He touches her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> and she instinctively punches him in the nose, certain {{that he was trying to}} grab her.|$|E
5|$|During the strike-shortened 1994 season, Hoffman {{took over}} closer duties from an injured and {{ineffective}} Gene Harris in mid-April. Hoffman recorded 20 saves and a 2.57 ERA while averaging 10.9 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (K/9). The weekend after the strike began, Hoffman, playing Nerf football at Del Mar Beach near San Diego, dived for a pass and landed awkwardly {{on his right}} shoulder. He later played volleyball and landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> again while going for a dig. He heard a strange sound.|$|E

5|$|Hennig and Janensch, while {{grouping}} the dermal armour elements {{into four}} distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them, shorter and flatter plates {{at the front}} gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows {{along the back of}} the animal, a marked contrast to the better-known North American Stegosaurus, which had one row of plates on the neck, trunk and tail, and two rows of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and having a very broad base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions placed it on the hips, at the iliac blade, while many recent reconstructions place it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> in the Chinese stegosaurs Gigantspinosaurus and Huayangosaurus.|$|E
5|$|In 1556, amid great pomp, {{and leaning}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{of one of}} his {{favorites}} (the 24-year-old William, Count of Nassau and Orange), Charles gave away his lands and his offices. The Spanish empire, which included Spain, the Netherlands, Naples, Milan and Spain's possessions in the Americas, went to his son, Philip. His brother, Ferdinand, who had negotiated the treaty in the previous year, was already in possession of the Austrian lands and was also the obvious candidate to succeed Charles as Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Senators {{unveiled}} a new logo, taking the head, {{which had been}} in profile, and rotating {{it so that it}} was face-first. The new logo was unveiled with a new red 'third' jersey, prominently using 'curved' or 'swoosh' stripes. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> the original logo was used as a shoulder patch. The original dark jersey, (then the 'away' jersey) which was mostly black, was retired after the season. The red jersey became the home jersey and it remained in use {{until the end of the}} 2007 Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E

5|$|The Charolais breed was small, {{and most}} closely {{physically}} resembled the Morvan horse, another now-extinct French type. The breed {{had a short}} head with small ears and a short, strong neck attached low <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b> The body was short and rounded, with a broad croup and strong legs. They were {{generally considered to be}} small and inelegant. They were strong, robust and hardy, the last of these traits especially so before the breeding changes of the 19th century, and were known for their pulling power.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{recorded}} depth {{for this}} form is 0 m; the maximum recorded depth is 6 m.

Pilsbry and Thomas L. Mcginty in 1939. This subspecies {{has since been}} considered a synonym of S. cicatricosa, and consequently of S. granulata.|$|E

5|$|The {{queen conch}} is herbivorous {{and lives in}} {{seagrass}} beds, although its exact habitat varies by development stage. The adult animal has a very large, solid and heavy shell, with knob-like spines <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> a flared thick, outer lip and a characteristic pink-coloured aperture (opening). The flared lip is absent in younger specimens. The external anatomy of the soft parts of L.gigas {{is similar to that}} of other snails in its family; it has a long snout, two eyestalks with well-developed eyes, additional sensory tentacles, a strong foot and a corneous, sickle-shaped operculum.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Ostrom {{published}} another monograph <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> of Deinonychus {{in which}} {{he realized that the}} pubis that he had described was actually a coracoid– a shoulder element. In that same year, another specimen of Deinonychus, MCZ 4371, was discovered and excavated in Montana by Steven Orzack during a Harvard University expedition headed by Farish Jenkins. This discovery added several new elements: well preserved femurs, pubes, a sacrum, and better ilia, as well as elements of the pes and metatarsus. Ostrom described this specimen and revised his skeletal restoration of Deinonychus. This time it showed the very long pubis, and Ostrom began to suspect that they may have even been a little retroverted like those of birds.|$|E
5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} appears <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{of the dying}} Cú Chulainn, and {{could also be a}} manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is {{associated}} with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E

5|$|Musical accompaniment for {{the silent}} films were not {{provided}} by the studios, and the Thanhouser productions were no exception. The musical program for the screenings were decided and played by the individual accompanists. At times, musical accompaniments were shared in trade journals and the musical accompaniment for Adrift was provided by an unnamed writer from Oklahoma in The Moving Picture World. The suggestion was {{to begin with a}} waltz until the friend pats the artist <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> when All I Get is Sympathy is played. The suggestion for I Don't Know Where I'm Going completes the scene and Life's A Funny Proposition follows the artist packing up until the artist pulls out the gun.

5|$|Oasis {{signed to}} {{independent}} record label Creation Records in 1993 and released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe (1994). The following year the band recorded (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995) with drummer Alan White, {{in the midst}} of a chart rivalry with Britpop peers Blur. Along with Suede, Pulp, Blur and others, Oasis came to be regarded as one of the major bands of the Britpop movement and the Gallagher brothers were featured regularly in tabloid newspapers for their sibling disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1997 Oasis released their third album, Be Here Now (1997), and although it was the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, the album's popularity tapered off quickly, but not before selling 8 million copies. McGuigan and Arthurs left Oasis in 1999 as the band released Standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shoulder</b> of Giants (2000). After their departures, they were replaced by former Heavy Stereo guitarist/frontman Gem Archer and former Ride guitarist/frontman Andy Bell. Their fifth studio album Heathen Chemistry was released in 2002. In 2004 drummer Alan White left the band leaving them as a four-piece with addition of the Who drummer Zak Starkey as recording and touring unofficial fifth member and found renewed success and popularity with Don't Believe the Truth (2005).|$|E
5|$|Shortly before midnight, Taylor was {{led into}} the {{execution}} chamber and strapped to a chair 17 {{feet away from the}} shooters with a hood covering his head. Multiple bright lights covered Taylor. Sandbags were arranged behind him to prevent any ricochets. The captain walked down the aisle, tapping each shooter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> to check to see if they were ready. At 12:03 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on January 26, 1996, every shooter fired at the count of five and the white cloth target on Taylor's chest flew off. His chest moved upward and his left hand tightened into a fist. His grip gradually loosened and his head fell back. A doctor checked Taylor's neck for a pulse and cut two holes in his hood to check for a pupillary light reflex. Taylor was declared dead at 12:07 a.m. and became the 49th person to be executed in the state of Utah since 1852.|$|E
