40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a one-year study on large-stone asphalt mixtures (LSAM). A thorough review of the existing technology regarding materials, mix design, and performance is included. This study expanded upon the body of knowledge by exploring an easier means of mixture design and explaining the fundamental properties of large-stone mixtures with respect to the aggregate gradation. It was found that a dense LSAM gradation possesses better strength and durability properties than a more <b>open</b> LSAM <b>gradation.</b> Furthermore, a mix design methodology is presented wherein the optimum asphalt content for the mixture may be determined on the basis of aggregate and compacted sample properties. This eliminates the need for cumbersome Marshall stability and flow measurements. The frequency dependency of large-stone mixtures is more pronounced at low temperatures than that of a conventional mixture. The tendency for thermal cracking should be lower for a LSAM than for a conventional mixture. Finally, recommendations are made to develop a permissive specification for LSAM, and to adopt the volumetric mixture design procedure outlined in the report.

40|$|Mixture of {{porous asphalt}} have several {{advantages}} for {{users of the}} road and around the way, which is: the drainage function, the function of the safety of drivers, and road noise reduction function. This is due to the voids (porosity) are contained in porous asphalt mixturesis substantial. Large cavity can cause a decline {{in the value of the}} characteristics on porous asphalt mixtures. Load bearing capability (stability) in a mixture of porous asphalt is drastically reduced when compared to conventional asphalt mix (dense graded asphalt). Asphalt has a molecular structure is highly complex and varied in size and different of chemical bond. All of these types of molecules interact with each other in a different way, interaction among these molecules effect not only the chemical properties of the asphalt but also the physical properties of asphalt. Basically the high temperature induce the formation of Co and O in sea water. If the mixture at high temperature suddenly cooled, Co, in this research contains minerals of sea water will react with other compounds in the asphalt and the reaction accelerated with increasing temperature The Asbuton liquid is new innovation from Asbuton rock manufacturing that consist of CaCO 3.
