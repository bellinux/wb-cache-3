5|$|There {{is little}} {{documented}} history for Abby Morrell after 1838: two records, respectively dated 1841 and 1850, place her in New York, but details <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> eventual death are unknown.|$|E
5|$|If Curie's work helped {{overturn}} established {{ideas in}} physics and chemistry, {{it has had}} an equally profound effect in the societal sphere. To attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her native and her adoptive country, that were placed in her way {{because she was a}} woman. This aspect <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> career is highlighted in Françoise Giroud's Marie Curie: A Life, which emphasizes Marie's role as a feminist precursor.|$|E

5|$|Upon Queen Victoria's death, Beatrice {{began the}} momentous task of transcribing and editing her mother's journals, {{which had been}} kept since 1831. The {{hundreds}} of volumes contained the Queen's personal views of the day-to-day business <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> included personal and family matters as well as matters of state.|$|E
5|$|Betty {{has gained}} weight {{over the past}} few months, causing her self-worth to drop and her sex life with Henry to flatline. This prompts an {{intervention}} of sorts from Henry's mother, Pauline, who suggests diet pills. When Betty goes to the doctor's office in an attempt to obtain diet pills, the doctor refuses. After a routine examination, he finds a possibly cancerous lump in Betty's throat. Betty returns home in a hysteric fever. She calls Don, who reassures her. Betty begins to confront the legacy <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> the effect her death would have on her loved ones. Several days later, the doctor calls back to tell her the tumor is benign. Henry holds a despondent Betty in his arms. She ponders her life as simply a sad, fat housewife.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Needham (died 3 May 1731), {{also known}} as Mother Needham, was an English procuress and brothel-keeper of 18th-century London, who has been {{identified}} as the bawd greeting Moll Hackabout in the first plate of William Hogarth's series of satirical etchings, A Harlot's Progress. Although Needham was notorious in London at the time, little is recorded <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> no genuine portraits of her survive. Her house was the most exclusive in London and her customers came from the highest strata of fashionable society, but she eventually ran afoul of the moral reformers of the day and {{died as a result of}} the severe treatment she received after being sentenced to stand in the pillory.|$|E

5|$|In 1948, feeling {{threatened}} by Joseph Stalin's regime, Olga emigrated with her immediate family to {{a farm in}} Ontario, Canada. With advancing age, Olga and her husband moved to a bungalow near Cooksville, Ontario. Colonel Kulikovsky died there in 1958. Two years later, as her health deteriorated, Olga moved with devoted friends to a small apartment in East Toronto. She died aged 78, seven months after her older sister, Xenia. At the end <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> afterwards, Olga was widely labeled the last Grand Duchess of Imperial Russia.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, 25 {{years after}} the end of their relationship, Joyce Maynard {{auctioned}} a series of letters Salinger had written her. Maynard's memoir <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> her relationship with Salinger, At Home in the World: A Memoir, was published the same year. Among other topics, the book described how Maynard's mother had consulted with her on how to appeal to the aging author (who was dressing like a child), and described Joyce's relationship with him at length. In the ensuing controversy over both the memoir and the letters, Maynard claimed that she was forced to auction the letters for financial reasons; she would have preferred to donate them to the Beinecke Library. Software developer Peter Norton bought the letters for US$156,500 and announced his intention to return them to Salinger.|$|E
5|$|Hyde Park {{has been}} a major venue for several Royal jubilees and celebrations. For the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887, a party was {{organised}} on 22 June where around 26,000 school children were given a free meal as a gift. The Queen and the Prince of Wales made an unexpected appearance at the event. Victoria remained fond of Hyde Park in the final years <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> often drove there twice a day. As part of the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977, a Jubilee Exhibition was set up in Hyde Park, with the Queen and Prince Philip visiting on 30 June. In 2012, a major festival took place in the park as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. On 6 February, the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery fired a 41-gun Royal Salute at Hyde Park Corner.|$|E

5|$|Research for {{the film}} was done through {{available}} sources, such as online information and newspaper archives. Kom's videos {{played a key role}} in the research. The writer also had several telephone and email conversations with her regarding her biography. In her interactions with Quadras and Kumar, Kom was forthcoming when it came to the details <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> had significant input in the screenplay. However, Quadras revealed that his biggest challenge was to make the film authentic and cinematic yet not documentary-like, so he wrote the film in a manner that showed the struggles Kom went through as a female sportsperson who had to confront opposition from her father, politics and making a comeback after a long career break. The film only shows the period from her early struggles and her comeback after motherhood. Her fifth World Boxing Championship win and the London Olympics were left out because of the contract that permitted a depiction of Kom's life up to 2008. The contract {{for the film}} was signed at that time when Kom had not even qualified for the London Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} the group {{dispersed}} after the events. Peter the Painter was never seen or heard from again. It was assumed he left the country, and there were several possible sightings in the years afterwards; none were confirmed. Jacob Peters returned to Russia, rose to be deputy head of the Cheka, the Soviet secret police, and was executed in Joseph Stalin's 1938 purge. Trassjonsky had a mental breakdown and was confined for a time at Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum. Her eventual fate and date of death are unknown. Dubof, Federoff and Hoffmann disappeared from the records; Vassilleva remained in the East End for the remainder <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> died at Brick Lane in 1963. Smoller left the country in 1911 and travelled to Paris, after which he disappeared; Milstein later emigrated to live in the United States.|$|E
