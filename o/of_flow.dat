5|$|In {{ecosystems}} such as mangrove swamps, trees {{play a role}} {{in developing}} the habitat, since the roots of the mangrove trees reduce the speed <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> of tidal currents and trap water-borne sediment, reducing the water depth and creating suitable conditions for further mangrove colonisation.

30|$|It is {{interesting}} from Fig. 24 that different coding conditions have different trend {{as the number}} <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> increases. When there are two flows, the MCC is 100 %. However, MCC decreases sharply with the increasing <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>flows,</b> because MCC requires that the two intersecting flows should not be coded before the intersecting node, which is hard to be satisfied in network with more flows. EMCC increases first and then decrease when the number <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> is 8, since EMCC has no limitation on whether the flows have been coded before intersecting node, but strictly limits the node of overhearing, thus reduces the coding opportunities as the number <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> increases. UCC- 2 increases rapidly when the number <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> is between 6 and 16. When the number <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> is over 16, UCC- 2 is over 40 % and grows slower, but far larger than other coding conditions since UCC- 2 can find many potential coding opportunities that MCC and EMCC cannot discover. UCC-N discovers the coding opportunities involve multiple flows which is usually greater than 3. As the number <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> grows, the chance that multiple flows intersect at one node increases and the coding condition percentage of UCC-N ascends gradually.|$|R
5|$|By {{historical}} convention, {{a positive}} current {{is defined as}} having the same direction <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, {{one of the most}} familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.|$|E
5|$|In fluid dynamics, Couette flow is {{the flow}} of a viscous fluid {{in the space between}} two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The flow is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Distributed media streaming, {{which uses}} {{multiple}} senders to collaboratively and simultaneously stream media content to a receiver, poses new challenges in congestion control. Such approach establishes multiple flows within a session. Since conventional congestion control only aims {{to make each}} <b>of</b> these <b>flows</b> TCP-friendly, selfish users can increase the number <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> to grab {{a larger share of}} the bandwidth, introducing more congestion and degrading the overall network performance. To address this issue, we propose the idea of task-level TCPfriendliness, which enforces TCP-friendliness upon a set <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> belonging to a task instead <b>of</b> upon individual <b>flow.</b> We design DMSCC, a congestion control scheme, to achieve task-level TCP-friendliness in distributed media streaming. By observing shared congestion, DMSCC identifies the set <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> experiencing congestion and dynamically adjusts those flows such that their combined throughput is TCP-friendly. To achieve this goal, DMSCC addresses two issues: (i) given a β (β < 1), how to control a flow using AIMD such that it consumes β-times the throughput <b>of</b> a TCP <b>flow,</b> and (ii) how to identify the set <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> that share a bottleneck. In our simulations, DMSCC can effectively regulate the throughput <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> on every bottleneck, resulting in a TCP-friendly combined throughput. I...|$|R
