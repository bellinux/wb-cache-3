5|$|In Hindu mythology, Parvati, wife of Shiva, once {{closed the}} eyes of her husband playfully in a flower garden at their abode atop Mount Kailash. Although <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> for the gods, all light {{was taken from the}} universe, and the earth, in turn, was {{submerged}} in darkness for years. Parvati performed penance along with other devotees of Shiva. Then her husband appeared as a column of fire at the top of Annamalai hills, returning light to the world. He then merged with Parvati to form Ardhanarishvara, the half-female, half-male form of Shiva. The Annamalai, or red mountain, lies behind the Annamalaiyar temple, and is associated with the temple of its namesake. The hill is sacred and considered a lingam, or iconic representation of Shiva, in itself.|$|E

If, for example, a cantilever is used for the uprighting of a molar, which should not be extruded, the cantilever should be as long as possible or counteracted by a second cantilever.|$|E

25|$|Dantzig's {{original}} {{example of}} finding the best assignment of 70 people to 70 jobs exemplifies the usefulness of linear programming. The computing power required to test all the permutations to select the best assignment is vast; the number of possible configurations exceeds the number of particles in the universe. However, it takes <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to find the optimum solution by posing the problem as a linear program and applying the Simplex algorithm. The theory behind linear programming drastically reduces the number of possible optimal solutions that must be checked.|$|E

2500|$|According to this statement, {{one could}} {{think that the}} sublime, for Longinus, was <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of evasion from reality. But on the contrary, he thought that {{literature}} could model a soul, and that a soul could pour itself out into a work of art. In this way the treatise becomes not only a text of literary inquiry, but also one of ethical dissertation, since the Sublime becomes the product of a great soul ( [...] , megalophrosunēs apēchēma). The sources of the Sublime are of two kinds: inborn sources ("aspiration to vigorous concepts" [...] and [...] "strong and enthusiastic passion") and acquirable sources (rhetorical devices, choice of the right lexicon, and [...] "dignified and high composition").|$|E

2500|$|The {{writer and}} {{television}} personality Alexander King said I think the outstanding characteristics of my friend's personality are affirmation, emphasis, and overemphasis. He chooses to express himself predominantly in superlatives and the gestures which accompany his utterances are sometimes dangerous {{to life and}} limb. Of the bystanders, I mean. King also spoke with affectionate amusement about Margules' pride in his cooking, speaking of how [...] "if he should ever invite you to dinner, he may serve you a hamburger with onions, in his kitchen-living room, with such an air of gastronomic protocol, such mysterious hints and ogliing innuendoes, as if César Ritz and Brillat-Savarin had sneaked out, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> before, with his secret recipe in their pockets." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{his claims}} have been controversial, Bob Lazar {{has stated that}} during his {{employment}} at the mysterious S-4 facility in Nevada he briefly witnessed an Aurora flight while aboard a bus near Groom Lake.

Although Lazar saw the aircraft for <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> through the front of the bus, he described it as being [...] "very large" [...] and having [...] "two huge, square exhausts with vanes in them". [...] Lazar claims that his supervisor confirmed to him that the aircraft was indeed an [...] "Aurora", a [...] "high altitude research plane". He was also told that the aircraft was powered by [...] "liquid methane".|$|E
2500|$|Larry Linville {{noted that}} his [...] "Frank Burns" [...] {{character}} {{was easier to}} make light of after head comedy writer Larry Gelbart departed after season 4 and Frank and Margaret parted ways in season 5. After season 4, Linville realized that he had taken Frank Burns as far as he could, and he decided that since he had signed a five-year contract, he would leave the series after season 5. During the first episode of season 6, [...] "Fade Out, Fade In", Burns (off camera) suffers a nervous breakdown due to Margaret's marriage and is held for psychiatric evaluation. Hawkeye offered a toast to Frank's departure, pausing <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> then stating [...] "Goodbye, Ferret Face." [...] In an unexpected twist, Burns is transferred to an Indiana Veterans Administration hospital, near his home in Fort Wayne, and is promoted to lieutenant colonel – in a sense, Frank's parting shot at Hawkeye. Unlike McLean Stevenson and Wayne Rogers, Linville had no regrets about leaving the series, saying, [...] "I felt I had done everything possible with the character." [...] Linville was not alone when he left; Executive Producer Gene Reynolds left after the production of season 5, and Burt Metcalfe and star Alan Alda took over the producing responsibilities. During season 6, Alda and Metcalfe even consulted Reynolds once a week, mainly to obtain help with their jobs as executive producers. These two men remained as executive producers for the remaining six seasons, as Reynolds was credited as a creative consultant along with Alan Alda.|$|E
