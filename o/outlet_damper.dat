40|$|Operations and {{maintenance}} continued {{this month at}} the Electric Power Research Institute`s Environmental Control Technology Center. Testing on the 4. 0 MW Pilot Wet FGD unit continued this month with the Trace Element Removal test block (TER) as the Pilot was operated under forced oxidation conditions. With this testing, the mercury measurement (Method 29) studies also continued as investigations into various activated carbons, metal amalgams, and impinger capture solutions were conducted. Following these studies, a brief test of the Pilot High Velocity FGD configuration (PHV) was conducted. This test block will be continued {{at the end of}} the month after the Fall outage is completed. The 1. 0 MW Cold-Side Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) unit remained idle this month in a cold-standby mode. During this month`s outage, the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>damper</b> plates were sealed to isolate the SCR system from flue gas. Also, the internals of the heat pipe heat exchanger (HPHE) and catalyst reactor tower were inspected and cleaned so that the system could be available for future test activities. Monthly inspections of all SCR system equipment placed in this cold-standby mode, as well as the fire safety systems in the SCR building, will continue to be conducted by the ECTC maintenance department and will include manual rotation of the booster fan...|$|E
40|$|Squeeze film dampers are a {{means of}} curing instabilities in {{rotating}} shaft assemblies. Their efficiency depends {{very much on the}} condition of the oil, which in turn depends on inlet and <b>outlet</b> arrangements, on <b>damper</b> geometry and on the flexibility of the rotor and surrounding structure. Rig investigations in which structural flexibility is included experimentally are discussed. Comparisons are made between measured and predicted results...|$|R
40|$|This Acceptance Test Report validates {{the testing}} performed, the {{exceptions}} logged and resolved and certifies {{this portion of}} the SAMCONS has met all design and test criteria to perform as an operational system. The proper installation of the PUREX exhaust ventilation system components and wiring was systematically evaluated by performance of this procedure. Proper operation of PUREX exhaust fan inlet, <b>outlet,</b> and vortex <b>damper</b> actuators and limit switches were verified, using special test equipment, to be correct and installed wiring connections were verified by operation of this equipment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{work performed}} at IRSID/USINOR in France and the University of Greenwich, UK, to investigate flow structures and turbulence in a water-model container, simulating aspects typical of metal tundish operation. Extensive mean and fluctuating velocity measurements were performed at IRSID using LDA {{to determine the}} flow field and these {{form the basis for}} a numerical model validation. This apparently simple problem poses several difficulties for the CFD modelling. The flow is driven by the strong impinging jet at the inlet. Accurate description of the jet is most important and requires a localized fine grid, but also a turbulence model that predicts the correct spreading rates of jet and impinging wall boundary layers. The velocities in the bulk of the tundish tend to be (indeed need to be) much smaller than those of the jet, leading to damping of turbulence, or even laminar flow. The authors have developed several low-Reynolds number (low-Re) k–var epsilon model variants to compute this flow and compare against measurements. Best agreement is obtained when turbulence damping is introduced to account not only for walls, but also for low-Re regions in the bulk – the k–var epsilon model otherwise allows turbulence to accumulate in the container due to the restricted <b>outlet.</b> Several <b>damping</b> functions are tested and the results reported here. The k–ω model, which is more suited to transitional flow, also seems to perform well in this problem...|$|R
