We will insist on three points: the importance of the “singularity ” of each “products”, and of the complementarities between knowledge units, and knowledge transactions; the specific problems of evaluation of knowledge items; the importance to consider the systems of institutions implied by the commoditization of knowledge. In a last section we will try to illustrate these points by considering two historical cases: The emergence <b>of</b> a <b>market</b> <b>for</b> technology in the United States in the nineteenth century and the formation of a new “knowledge market regime ” since the 1980 ’s...|$|R
