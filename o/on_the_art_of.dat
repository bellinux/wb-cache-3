5|$|Politically, the {{treatise}} was a success. At {{the time}} of writing <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> <b>of</b> the Cinema, Kim's father Kim Il-sung was systematically rallying support for the younger Kim to prepare for his succession. By authoring the work, Kim Jong-il gained social and political power. He secured his father's confidence, thus making succession possible. Kim Jong-il continued to write on the arts until the 1990s and published treatises <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> <b>of</b> Opera (1974), <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> <b>of</b> the Drama (1988), <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> <b>of</b> Dance (1990), <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> <b>of</b> Music (1991), On Fine Art (1991), On Architecture (1991), On Juche Literature (1992), and On Acrobatics.|$|E

The following year appeared Culinary Chemistry, in which Accum provided practical information about the scientific basis of cooking. He also published a book on bread (A Treatise <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> <b>of</b> Making Good and Wholesome Bread). Even when he had returned to Germany, his works continued to be reprinted and were translated into French, Italian and German, reaching a wide readership in Europe, {{as well as in the}} US after it was reprinted there.|$|E

5|$|In {{the history}} of art, the {{original}} Greek authorities are Duris of Samos, Xenocrates of Sicyon, and Antigonus of Carystus. The anecdotic element has been ascribed to Duris (XXXIV:61); the notices of the successive developments {{of art and the}} list of workers in bronze and painters to Xenocrates; and a large amount of miscellaneous information to Antigonus. Both Xenocrates and Antigonus are named in connection with Parrhasius (XXXV:68), while Antigonus is named in the indexes of XXXIII–XXXIV as a writer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> embossing metal, or working it in ornamental relief or intaglio.|$|E
5|$|Kim himself {{considered}} his treatise a failure. Films it {{had contributed to}} were enjoyed at home, but abroad they were ridiculed. North Korean cinema could not compete {{with the quality of}} foreign, and in particular South Korean, films. This directly prompted him to kidnap Shin Sang-ok, South Korea's most famous film director, in 1978. Shin and his wife, actress Choi Eun-hee, were kept in North Korea for eight years under cruel conditions. Nevertheless, Shin studied <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> <b>of</b> the Cinema to please Kim with the kaijū film Pulgasari, which credits Kim as the executive producer. Kim was delighted with the film and allowed Shin and Choi to travel to Vienna, where they were supposed to negotiate a deal for a sequel. The couple used the opportunity to escape, and ended up in America.|$|E

Dampiya Atuva Gatapadaya is another, and is a {{glossary}} for the Pali Dhammapadatthakatha, providing Sinhala words and synonyms for Pali words. The third book is Mula Sikha Ha Sikhavalanda, a set of disciplinary rules for Buddhist monks. Both these have been written during the last two centuries of the Anuradhapura period.|$|E
5|$|Popping as an {{umbrella}} term also includes gliding. Gliding is a lower body dance performed {{with little to}} no movements in the chest or arms. In gliding a dancer appears {{as if they are}} drifting across the floor on ice. Opposite from gliding is tutting, an upper body dance that uses the arms, hands, and wrists to form right angles and create geometric box-like shapes. Tutting can be done primarily with the fingers rather than the arms. This method is called finger tutting. In both variations the movements are intricate, linear, and form 90° or 45° angles. In practice, tutting looks like the characters <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> ancient Egypt, hence the name—a reference to King Tut.|$|E
5|$|During {{the earlier}} Northern and Southern dynasties (420–589), {{and perhaps even}} earlier, the {{drinking}} of tea (Camellia sinensis) became popular in southern China. Tea was viewed then as a beverage of tasteful pleasure and with pharmacological purpose as well. During the Tang dynasty, tea became synonymous with everything sophisticated in society. The poet Lu Tong (790–835) devoted most of his poetry to his love of tea. The 8th-century author Lu Yu (known as the Sage of Tea) even wrote a treatise <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> drinking tea, called The Classic of Tea. Although wrapping paper {{had been used in}} China since the 2nd century BC, during the Tang dynasty the Chinese were using wrapping paper as folded and sewn square bags to hold and preserve the flavor of tea leaves. Indeed, paper found many other uses besides writing and wrapping during the Tang era.|$|E

5|$|If {{the account}} of Sima Qian (c. 145–86 BC) in his Records of the Grand Historian is proven correct upon the {{unearthing}} of Qin Shi Huang's (r. 221–210 BC) tomb, the raised-relief map has existed since the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC). Robert Temple and Joseph Needham suggest that certain pottery vessels of the Han Dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) showing artificial mountains as lid decorations may have influenced the raised-relief map. The Han Dynasty general Ma Yuan (14 BC – 49 AD) made a raised-relief map of valleys and mountains in a rice-constructed model of 32 AD. Such rice models were expounded on by the Tang Dynasty (618–907) author Jiang Fang in his Essay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> <b>of</b> Constructing Mountains with Rice (c. 845 AD). A raised-relief map made of wood representing all the provinces of the empire and put together like a giant 0.93 m2 (10ft2) jigsaw puzzle was invented by Xie Zhuang (421–466 AD) during the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479).|$|E
5|$|Malouma {{commenced}} {{her education}} at {{elementary school in}} 1965 in Mederdra. She qualified as {{an elementary school teacher}} in 1974 in Rosso. According to the traditions of her country, those of the Meidah family are required to carry <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> their ancestors. As a result, she had to give up her aspirations to teach. Members of each caste are allowed only to marry other members of society within the same caste and the entire society is divided by castes politically, economically, and culturally. Movement outside of a particular caste is forbidden. She learned to play the traditional stringed instruments only women play, especially the ardin harp, and was taught traditional Mauritanian music by her father, who enjoyed an eclectic mix of music. As a result, she grew up listening to classical western works such as Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, Vivaldi and Wagner, as well as the music of traditional Berber, Egyptian, Lebanese and Senegalese artists. She often accompanied her parents who sang traditional griots.|$|E

Xie Zhuang (421–466) of the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479) created a 0.93 m2 (10ft2) wooden raised-relief map of the empire (showing mountains and rivers) which could be taken apart and pieced together like a giant jigsaw puzzle.
