5|$|Beliefs in {{the divine}} and in the afterlife were {{ingrained}} in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule {{was based on the}} divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system. These various conceptions <b>of</b> <b>divinity</b> were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.|$|E

5|$|Edward VI acceded to the English throne in 1547, and the Protestant reformers there {{hoped to}} take the {{opportunity}} to more thoroughly reform the Church of England. Archbishop Thomas Cranmer invited Vermigli and Ochino to assist in the effort. In addition, the victory of Catholic Emperor Charles V in the Schmalkaldic War and the resulting Augsburg Interim led to a hostile environment for Protestants in Germany. Vermigli accepted the invitation in November and sailed with Ochino to England. In 1548, he replaced Richard Smyth, becoming the second Regius Professor <b>of</b> <b>Divinity</b> at Oxford. This was a very influential post at a university which had been slow to accept reform.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a careful study {{of all the}} {{iconographic}} aspects of the processions of gods rerpresented {{in the book of}} the Day. Comparing the different sources, it has been possible to create clusters <b>of</b> <b>divinities</b> and to classify them according to their function within the diurnal solar journey. Of fundamental importance has been the study of the tomb of Ramose Tt 132. The careful analysis of the iconographical programme of this unpublished tomb has enabled the author to identify cluster <b>of</b> <b>divinities</b> in KV 9 and attempt a subdivision <b>of</b> the <b>divinities</b> depicted {{on the walls of the}} royal tombs. This thesis has also shown that in the study of the NK Books of the Netherworld the iconographical aspect is as important as the filological one...|$|R
5|$|Lang {{continued}} to visit Oxford when time allowed {{and on a}} visit to All Souls in June 1893 he was offered the post of Dean <b>of</b> <b>Divinity</b> at Magdalen College. Other offers were open to him; the Bishop of Newcastle wished to appoint him vicar of the cathedral church in Newcastle and Benjamin Jowett wished him to return to Balliol as a tutor in theology. Lang chose Magdalen; the idea of being in charge of young men who might in the future achieve positions of responsibility was attractive to him and, in October 1893, with many regrets, he left Leeds.|$|E
