5|$|After the {{financial}} success of Dr. No, United Artists doubled the budget offered to Eon Productions to $2 {{million for the}} company's next film, From Russia with Love. The film was shot in Europe, which had turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> more profitable market for Dr. No. Most of the crew from the first film returned, with major exceptions being production designer Ken Adam—who {{went to work on}} Dr. Strangelove and was replaced by Dr. Nos art director Syd Cain—and title designer Maurice Binder, who was replaced by Robert Brownjohn.|$|E
5|$|Cars {{would be}} the final film worked on by Joe Ranft {{who died in a}} car {{accident}} a year before the film's release, aged 45. The film was the second to be dedicated to his memory, after Corpse Bride (that showed the roles he had done in the other films directed by John Lasseter during the credits). This is also the last (non-documentary) movie for Paul Newman before his retirement in 2007 and his death in 2008. It turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> highest-grossing film of his career.|$|E

His initial {{appearances}} for Leicester were as a midfielder, {{and at first}} he failed to adjust and was booed by his own fans during a 2–1 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday. However, a move back to defence resulted in a change in fortunes for Kisnorbo, and his partnership with then-teammate Paddy McCarthy was instrumental in helping Leicester avoid relegation to League One that season.|$|E

The Cossor receivers were found to be unusable, weighing as much as the entire transmitter and receiver, and having sensitivity about half that of the EMI lash-up.|$|E

5|$|Whether it {{involved}} {{the history of}} the number zero or the invention of the transistor, two things stood out to me.

5|$|A fifth-place {{finish in}} the Premier League in 2004–05 meant Liverpool were not {{guaranteed}} entry into the Champions League, and faced the prospect {{of not being able}} to defend their European title. UEFA eventually ruled that they would be allowed to do so, but would be required to start in the first qualifying round, with no country protection, meaning they could face a team from England in the group stages. This turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case—Liverpool advanced through three qualifying rounds and were drawn with Chelsea in the group stages. They progressed from their group as winners but were beaten by Benfica in the first knock-out round.|$|E
5|$|After their {{win over}} Manchester City, the team then went a club-record 19 games without a victory, {{eventually}} finishing the 1999–2000 season 17th, with two late wins helping stave off relegation. The 2000–01 season saw them again narrowly avoid relegation, finishing 19th overall. The 2001–02 season turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> club's worst ever {{season at the}} time. With Stockport already bottom of the league, a 4–0 home defeat to Millwall saw manager Kilner sacked. Former England international Carlton Palmer was appointed in November 2001. Palmer subsequently failed to stop Stockport being relegated in 2001–02 or to build a team capable of challenging for a return the next season.|$|E
