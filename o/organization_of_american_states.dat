5|$|Congress {{was not as}} {{enthusiastic}} about a customs union as Blaine and Harrison were, but tariff reciprocity provisions were ultimately included in the McKinley Tariff that reduced duties on some inter-American trade.

SICA's General Secretariat is in El Salvador.|$|R
5|$|During the Torrijos presidency, Moscoso {{remained}} {{an active member}} of the opposition. In September 2007, she criticized the appointment of PRD politician Pedro Miguel González, who was wanted in the US for the murder of US Army sergeant Zak Hernández, as the head of the National Assembly.

5|$|Acheson was {{particularly}} worried that allowing {{the details of}} the coup to go public would damage the image of the US. The Rio Pact of 1947 had created the <b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>States,</b> or OAS, and this body had obtained jurisdiction over regional disputes from the United Nations. In order to achieve this, the US had also committed to a policy of non-intervention {{in the internal affairs of}} other countries. If PBFORTUNE had become public knowledge, the fact that the US was supporting an invasion of a country that was also a member of the OAS would have represented a huge setback to US policy. Thus the State Department promptly ended the operation when they became aware that its cover was blown.|$|E
50|$|Sanbar sat {{in various}} forums of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Two of his {{international}} initiatives gained fame: A Proposal {{for the establishment}} of an institution providing guarantees for the export of capital between developing countries (This was later adopted by the <b>organization</b> <b>of</b> Latin <b>American</b> <b>states),</b> and a plan for gradual sale and disposal of monetary gold {{under the supervision of the}} IMF.|$|R
5000|$|Ture and Cuba's {{president}} Fidel Castro were mutual admirers, {{sharing a}} common opposition to imperialism. In Ture's final letter, he wrote:It was Fidel Castro who before the OLAS (<b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> Latin <b>American</b> <b>States)</b> Conference said [...] "if imperialism touches one grain of {{hair on his}} head, we shall not let the fact pass without retaliation." [...] It was he, who on his own behalf, asked them all to stay in contact with me when I returned to the United States to offer me protection.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, {{interest}} in integrating the Central American governments began. On October 14, 1951 (33 years after the CACJ was dissolved) the governments of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua signed a treaty creating the <b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> Central <b>American</b> <b>States</b> (Organización de Estados Centroamericanos, or ODECA) to promote regional cooperation and unity. The following year (December 12, 1952), ODECA's charter was amended {{to create a new}} Central <b>American</b> Court <b>of</b> Justice (Corte Centroamericana de Justicia, or CCJ) without the time limit of its previous incarnation.|$|R
5|$|Canada was a {{founding}} member of the United Nations and has membership in the World Trade Organization, the G20 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Canada is also a member of various other international and regional organizations and forums for economic and cultural affairs. Canada acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1976. Canada joined the <b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>States</b> (OAS) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in 2000 and the 3rd Summit of the Americas in 2001. Canada seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim economies through membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).|$|E
5|$|Although the {{two leaders}} had a strong relationship, by 1960 US {{officials}} were becoming concerned by what they viewed as Canadian procrastination on vital issues, such as whether Canada should join the <b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>States</b> (OAS). Talks on these issues in June 1960 produced little in results. Diefenbaker hoped that US Vice President Richard Nixon would win the 1960 US presidential election, but when Nixon's Democratic rival, Senator John F. Kennedy won the race, he sent Senator Kennedy a note of congratulations. Kennedy did not respond until Canadian officials asked {{what had become of}} Diefenbaker's note, two weeks later. Diefenbaker, for whom such correspondence was very meaningful, was annoyed at the President-elect's slowness to respond. In January 1961, Diefenbaker visited Washington to sign the Columbia River Treaty. However, with only days remaining in the Eisenhower administration, little else could be accomplished.|$|E
5|$|Cuba's {{economy grew}} in 1974 {{as a result}} of high {{international}} sugar prices and new credits with Argentina, Canada, and parts of Western Europe. A number of Latin American states called for Cuba's re-admittance into the <b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>States</b> (OAS), with the U.S. finally conceding in 1975 on Henry Kissinger's advice. Cuba's government underwent a restructuring along Soviet lines, claiming that this would further democratization and decentralize power away from Castro. Officially announcing Cuba's identity as a socialist state, the first National Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held, and a new constitution adopted that abolished the position of President and Prime Minister. Castro remained the dominant figure in governance, taking the presidency of the newly created Council of State and Council of Ministers, making him both head of state and head of government.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn France {{as well as}} {{across the}} Atlantic, historians' {{interest}} in the State is relatively recent. In 1990, Rosanvallon was still deploring the state's status as a "historical non-object", whereas, three years earlier, for Leuchtenburg, then president <b>of</b> the <b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> historians, the <b>State</b> remained a "new frontier" to be conquered for the discipline...|$|R
50|$|Trade, not politics, {{also served}} as the {{principal}} issue around which various, uniquely Latin American regional organizations were formed after mid-century. On October 14, 1951, the governments of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua signed a new treaty creating the <b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> Central <b>American</b> <b>States</b> (Organización de Estados Centroamericanos, or ODECA) to promote regional cooperation, integration and unity in Central America.

5|$|The {{second part}} begins on November 3, 1966 with Guevara {{arriving}} in Bolivia {{disguised as a}} middle-aged representative of the <b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>States</b> hailing from Uruguay, who subsequently drives into the mountains to meet his men. The film is organized {{by the number of}} days {{that he was in the}} country. On Day 26, there is solidarity among Guevara's men despite his status as a foreigner. By Day 67, Guevara, however, has been set up for betrayal. He tries to recruit some peasants only to be mistaken for a cocaine smuggler, and the Bolivian Communist Party, led by Mario Monje, refuse to support the armed struggle. On Day 100, there is a shortage of food and Guevara exercises discipline to resolve conflicts between his Cuban and Bolivian followers.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August 1936, the United States {{had made}} it known that it would follow a policy of non-intervention, but did not {{announce}} it officially. This isolationism on the Spanish war would later be identified as disastrous by Under-Secretary of State Sumner Welles. Five days later, the Glenn L. Martin Company enquired whether the government would allow the sale of eight bombers to the Spanish Republican Air Force; the response was negative. It also confirmed it would not take part in several mediation attempts, including one by the <b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>States.</b> Mexico soon became the first nation to openly support the Republicans. On 15 August, the United Kingdom banned exports of war material to Spain. Neurath also agreed to the pact, and suggested that volunteers (many of whom would eventually form the International Brigades) be included. Italy similarly agreed, signing on 21 August after a determined diplomatic offensive by Britain and France. Although a surprising reversal of views, it has been put down to the growing belief that countries could not abide by the agreement anyway. Admiral Raeder urged the German government either to back the Nationalists more completely, and bring Europe {{to the brink of}} war, or to abandon them. On the 24th, Germany signed.|$|E
5|$|The United States is a {{founding}} member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, <b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>States</b> (OAS), and other international organizations. The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP and second-largest economy by PPP, accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP. The U.S. economy is the fastest-growing in the Americas and is largely post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge-based activities, although the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world. Though its population is only 4.3% of the world total, Americans hold 33.2% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share of global wealth concentrated in a single country. The United States ranks among the highest nations in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage, human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person. The U.S. is the foremost military power in the world, making up a third of global military spending. It is also a global leader in science and technology.|$|E
40|$|Facilitadores Judiciales is a {{programme}} {{run by the}} <b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> the <b>American</b> <b>States</b> and the Nicaraguan judiciary. In 2010, facilitators {{were recruited}} and trained in many but not all urban municipalities. This presented {{an opportunity for a}} natural experiment {{to assess the impact of}} the programme. In our theoretical framework the impact is related to improved access to justice which is one of the prerequisites for peace and development. Before and after quantitative and qualitative studies were conducted in intervention and control areas. The quantitative results show confirmation of some of the hypothesized effects of the programme. Other effects are indicated by the numerous in-depth interviews but are not substantiated by hard data. In the communities where facilitators were intro- duced the people report fewer legal problems. The facilitators are decreasing the costs of justice. Achieving amicable solutions and promotion of peace and social cohesion is another example of the programme’s impact...|$|R

5000|$|The EU's {{example is}} being {{followed}} by the African Union, the Union <b>of</b> South <b>American</b> Nations, the <b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> Central <b>American</b> <b>States,</b> and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. A multitude of regional associations, aggregating most nations of the world, are {{at different stages of}} development towards a growing extent of economic, and sometimes political, integration. The European Union consists of twenty-eight European states. It has developed a [...] "single market" [...] which allows people of different countries to travel from state to state without a passport. This also includes the same policies when it comes to trading. The European Union is said to have 26% of the world's money. Not all EU member states use the Euro; the United Kingdom, for example, retains the pound sterling. Where the Euro is in place, it allows easy access for the free circulation of trade goods. Tariffs are also the same for each country allowing no unfair practices within the union. The United Kingdom has also voted to leave the union.|$|R
5|$|Up to 1990, Nicaragua {{had lived}} with forty years of the Somoza dictatorship, through a decade of civil warfare and Sandinista rule, and five years of US imposed {{economic}} sanctions. On 25 February 1990, Chamorro won the election with a 54.7% share of the vote, ousting the incumbent Ortega and becoming the first elected woman president in the Americas. Because the election {{was held in the}} midst of a civil war, it was important both domestically and internationally that the vote was seen to be legitimate. The Esquipulas Peace Agreement which had been brokered by Arias, called for monitoring of elections by the <b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>States</b> and the United Nations, among other provisions. The election was the most strictly monitored of any in Latin America and involved 2,578 international observers among them former US President Jimmy Carter; Raul Alfonsín, former President of Argentina; Alfonso López Michelsen, former President of Colombia; Rodrigo Carazo Odio, former President of Costa Rica and many Caribbean and US dignitaries. Ortega and his supporters conceded defeat without argument and observers left only a skeleton staff to assist with the transition of power.|$|E

40|$|Facilitadores Judiciales is a {{programme}} {{run by the}} <b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> the <b>American</b> <b>States</b> and the Nicaraguan judiciary. The {{main objective}} of the programme is to improve access to justice for the disadvantaged people in Nicaragua. From 1998 to 2010 the programme was implemented in almost all rural and isolated areas of the country. In 2010, facilitators were recruited and trained in many but not all urban municipalities. This presented {{an opportunity for a}} natural experiment {{to assess the impact of}} the programme and identify the 'drivers' for success. Before (2010) and after (2013) quantitative and qualitative studies were conducted in intervention and control areas. The quantitative results show confirmation of some of the hypothesised effects of the Facilitadores Judiciales programme. Other effects are indicated by the numerous in-depth interviews but are not substantiated by hard data. Most importantly, in the communities where facilitators were introduced the people report less legal problems. The facilitators are decreasing the costs of justice thus making it more accessible. Achieving more amicable solutions and thus promotion of social cohesion is another example of an impact of the programme. Several factors for success are identified. First, the gradual scaling-up of the programme from rural to urban areas promotes sustainability and facilitates knowledge management. Second, the paper identifies the specific challenges of piloting a trust-based access to justice programme in urban areas. Another set of challenges is the different impact that different facilitators make in their communities. Personal motivation, skills, and abilities, gained social authority, received training, and level of involvement of the local judges are seen as crucial for the facilitators' effectiveness. Active ownership on behalf of the Nicaraguan judiciary is another factor of success identified by the study. At the end, the paper discusses the possibilities for expanding the programme beyond Nicaragua...|$|R
