5000|$|On a {{very general}} view, {{the array of}} {{economic}} transactions in the ethnographic record may be resolved into two types. First, those [...] "vice-versa" [...] movements between two parties known familiarly as 'reciprocity.' The second, centralized movements: collection from members of a group, often under one hand, and redivision with this group. This is 'pooling' or 'redistribution'. On an even more general view, the two types merge. For pooling is an organization <b>of</b> <b>reciprocities,</b> a system <b>of</b> <b>reciprocities</b> - a fact of central bearing upon the genesis of large scale redistribution under chiefly aegis.|$|R

25|$|When the {{exchange}} is immediate, as in barter, {{it does not}} create a social relationship. When {{the exchange}} is delayed, it creates both a relationship {{as well as an}} obligation for a return (i.e. debt). Hence, some forms <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> can establish hierarchy if the debt is not repaid. The failure to make a return may end a relationship between equals. Reciprocal exchanges can also have a political effect through the creation of multiple obligations and the establishment of leadership, as in the gift exchanges (Moka) between Big Men in Melanesia. Some forms <b>of</b> <b>reciprocity</b> are thus closely related to redistribution, where goods and services are collected by a central figure for eventual distribution to followers.|$|E
