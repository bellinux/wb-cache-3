25|$|In the {{following}} months, {{thousands of people}} flocked to Fátima and nearby Aljustrel, drawn by reports of visions and miracles. On 13 August 1917, the provincial administrator Artur Santos (no relation to Lúcia Santos) intervened, as he believed that these events were politically disruptive in the conservative country. He took the children into custody, jailing them before they could reach the Cova da Iria. Santos interrogated and threatened the children {{to get them to}} divulge the contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secrets.</b> Lúcia's mother hoped the officials could persuade the children to end the affair and admit that they had lied. Lúcia told Santos everything short <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secrets,</b> and offered to ask the woman for permission to tell the official the secrets.|$|E

25|$|Argus Filch is the {{caretaker}} of Hogwarts. While {{he is not}} an evil character, he is ill-tempered, which makes him unpopular with the student body, and occasionally with other staff. His knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secrets</b> and short-cuts of the castle is almost unparalleled, except perhaps by the Weasley twins, Voldemort himself, Harry, Ron and Hermione, and other users of the Marauder's Map. He tends to favour almost sadistically harsh punishments, leading to his alliance with Umbridge. He has an obsessive dislike of mud, animate toys, and all other things that might interfere with his creation of an immaculately clean and orderly Hogwarts. He is also portrayed as having a constant antagonism towards Peeves the poltergeist and often tells Dumbledore that Peeves should be thrown out of Hogwarts. He also likes to wander Hogwarts corridors at night, presumably in the hope of catching a student out of bed.|$|E
25|$|For {{years it}} has been a United States Coast Guard Academy {{tradition}} for fourth-class cadets (freshman) to hide the chain links that sit outside the cadet library, also known as Waesche Hall. The chain links are historic: they were used during the Revolutionary War to prevent ships from transiting up the Hudson River and attacking West Point. When Benedict Arnold betrayed the United States, the chain links were one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secrets</b> that he revealed to the British. The family that originally forged the chain donated the links to the United States Coast Guard Academy. Since the donation, the fourth class is challenged each year at the annual homecoming football game to outwit the second class (juniors) and keep the chain hidden until half-time. If the fourth class is successful in hiding the links {{until the end of the}} second quarter, it is granted some sort of reward such as carry-on (this allows the fourth class to have privileges of the upper upperclassman for a day).|$|E

25|$|As a batsman Jupp {{struck the}} happy medium between {{enterprise}} and caution. He watched the ball {{so well that}} when occasion demanded he could play a rigidly defensive game, while on a fast wicket there were few cricketers of his day better worth watching. He possessed {{a wide variety of}} strokes, and can drive or out with equal power and facility. His footwork, too, was so good that on a treacherous pitch he was a particularly valuable batsman. Before the First World War, and for a time afterwards he bowled medium pace rather on the quick side, but later took a shorter run, and became a slow to slow-medium bowler. Few bowlers of the 1920s spun the ball as much as he did and, with a wicket to help him, he could make it turn to a pronounced degree. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secrets</b> of his success as a bowler was his cleverness in adapting himself to the changing conditions of a pitch. He was also rated as a brilliant fieldsman at cover point.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventh}} and final book, Hermione accompanies Harry on his quest to destroy Voldemort's {{remaining}} Horcruxes. Before leaving on the quest, she helps {{ensure the safety of}} her parents by placing a false memory charm on them, making them think they are Wendell and Monica Wilkins, whose lifetime ambition is to move to Australia. She inherits Dumbledore's personal copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, which allows her to decipher some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secrets</b> of the Deathly Hallows. She prepared for their departure and journey by placing an Undetectable Extension Charm on a small beaded purse so she is able to fill the infinite depths of the bag with materials they will need. Hermione's spell saves her and Harry from Lord Voldemort and his snake Nagini in Godric's Hollow, although the ricochet snaps Harry's wand. When she, Ron, and Harry are captured by Snatchers, who are on the hunt for Muggle-borns under the Ministry's orders, Hermione disguises Harry by temporarily disfiguring his face with a Stinging Jinx. She also attempts to pass herself off as former Hogwarts student Penelope Clearwater and a half-blood to avoid persecution, but is later recognised and taken to Malfoy Manor where Bellatrix Lestrange tortures her with the Cruciatus Curse in an attempt to extract information on how Hermione, Harry, and Ron came to possess Godric Gryffindor's sword (which was supposed to be safe in the Lestrange vault at Gringotts). Even under torture, Hermione is able to use her quick thinking to lie to Bellatrix that the sword is a fake. When the others are able to escape their cell, Bellatrix threatens to slit Hermione's throat. Hermione, Harry, Ron and the other prisoners being held in Malfoy Manor are eventually rescued by Dobby.|$|E

500|$|In the 1970s, Laucke {{moved to}} New York City to further his career. He {{was asked by}} Valdès-Blain if he would mind sharing his one-room {{apartment}} with flamenco guitarist Paco deLucía.

500|$|In early 1912, Crowley {{published}} The Book of Lies, {{a work of}} mysticism that biographer Lawrence Sutin {{described as}} [...] "his greatest success in merging his talents as poet, scholar, and magus". The German occultist Theodor Reuss later accused him of publishing some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secrets</b> of his own occult order, the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), within The Book. Crowley convinced Reuss that the similarities were coincidental, and the two became friends. Reuss appointed Crowley {{as head of the}} O.T.O's British branch, the Mysteria Mystica Maxima (MMM), and at a ceremony in Berlin Crowley adopted the magical name of Baphomet and was proclaimed [...] "X° Supreme Rex and Sovereign Grand Master General of Ireland, Iona, and all the Britons". With Reuss' permission, Crowley set about advertising the MMM and re-writing many O.T.O. rituals, which were then based largely on Freemasonry; his incorporation of Thelemite elements proved controversial in the group. Fascinated by the O.T.O's emphasis on sex magic, Crowley devised a magical working based on anal sex and incorporated it into the syllabus for those O.T.O. members who had been initiated into the eleventh degree.|$|E
