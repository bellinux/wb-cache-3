25|$|Anxiety over {{imminent}} events {{grips the}} main characters in Conu Leonida faţă cu reacţiunea, and plays a part in female behavior as depicted in all his other comedies. A special kind of fear animates the main protagonists of D-ale carnavalului, whose jealousy leads them to act irrationally. Thus, Iancu Pampon, an assistant-barber and former police officer, and his female counterpart, the republican suburbanite Miţa Baston, are determined to uncover their partners' amorous escapades, and their hectic inquiry combines real clues with figments of imagination, fits of passionate rage with moments <b>of</b> <b>sad</b> meditation, and violent threats with periods of resignation. Glimpses into this type of behavior have been noted in other plays by Caragiale: Cazimir placed emphasis {{on the fact that}} Farfuridi is shown to be extremely cautious towards all unplanned changes, and consumes much of his energy in preserving a largely pointless daily routine.|$|E

25|$|OSS was disbanded {{shortly after}} World War II, with its {{intelligence}} analysis functions moving temporarily into the U.S. Department of State. Espionage and counterintelligence went into military units, while paramilitary and other covert action functions {{went into the}} Office of Policy Coordination set up in 1948. Between the original creation of the CIA by the National Security Act of 1947 and various mergers and reorganizations through 1952, the wartime OSS functions generally ended up in CIA. The mission of training and leading guerrillas in due course went to the United States Army Special Forces, but those missions required to remain covert were performed by the (Deputy) Directorate of Plans and its successor the Directorate of Operations of the CIA.

25|$|There is one {{additional}} theory {{that explains the}} occurrence of the reminiscence bump: the life script account. A life script refers to the series of culturally important transitional events {{that are expected to}} occur in a certain order at various points during the life span. During early adulthood one starts to make important decisions and have influencing experiences on his or her identity. The memories during this time period are therefore more significantly remembered because they are what has essentially determined and influenced their life script (Habernas & Bluck, 2000). A life script typically has the majority of expected transitional experiences occur during early adulthood (Gluck & Bluck, 2007), and usually include includes positive experiences such as marriage, the birth of a baby, or buying a house. Events that deviate from the life script are typically sad and traumatic. These events, such as the death of a child, are not culturally expected and often do not show a peak of recall at any specific point during the life span. Life scripts act as a way to structure memory and lead to the expectation that the happiest and the most important life events form the reminiscence bump. Contrary to the recall of happy events, the recall <b>of</b> <b>sad</b> events remains stable across the life span and does not exhibit a bump in recall.|$|E

500|$|Harrison {{wrote the}} Hindustani {{classical}} music-inspired [...] "Within You Without You" [...] after {{the decision was}} made to abandon his composition [...] "Only a Northern Song", which the band had recorded earlier in the sessions. The lyrics reflect Harrison's immersion in the teachings of the Hindu Vedas while the song's musical form and Indian instrumentation, such as sitar, tabla, dilrubas and tamburas, recall the Hindu devotional tradition known as bhajan. The track features a tempo rubato that is without precedent in the Beatles' catalogue. The pitch is derived from the eastern Khamaj scale, which is akin to the Mixolydian mode in the West. MacDonald regards the song as [...] "the most distant departure from the staple Beatles sound in their discography", and a work that represents the [...] "conscience" [...] of the LP through the lyrics' rejection of Western materialism. Womack calls it [...] "quite arguably, the album's ethical soul" [...] as a concise reflection of the Beatles' and the counterculture's perspective during the Summer of Love era. The track ends with a burst of laughter that some listeners interpret as a mockery of the song, but Harrison explained: [...] "It's a release after five minutes <b>of</b> <b>sad</b> music... You were supposed to hear the audience anyway, as they listen to Sergeant Pepper's Show. That was the style of the album."

500|$|Writing for Slant Magazine, Alexa Camp {{said the}} music video {{faithfully}} mirrored the song's lyrics and was understated by Del Rey's usual standards.

The visual was also lauded by Complex writer Lauren Nostro who {{called it a}} [...] "stunning, cinematic" [...] and [...] "beautiful" [...] video, and Anna Moslein of Glamour who deemed it [...] "summer-perfect". Zumic's Bradley Bershad described the clip as [...] "a slightly bizarre, very dramatic trip through time and space" [...] and said its noir influences matched the track well, adding that its [...] "old school meets new school" [...] feel continued the musical persona Del Rey had crafted for herself. Bershad's view was shared by Smith who wrote, [...] "It pretty well marries together her continuing play with female sexuality, Hollywood stereotypes and insistence that she is her own creation". While DeGroot commended the video's black-and-white photography and flame imagery which he opined were less pretentious than that of [...] "Jeremy", which [...] "West Coast" [...] was compared to. Matthew Bramlett of TheWrap opined that Del Rey [...] "perfectly encapsulates her 'vintage California rich kid' look" [...] in the video and described the clip as [...] "very chic, with just a twinge of the old Hollywood flair" [...] the singer had embraced in her previous visuals. In a mixed review, Patrick D. McDermott of The Fader called the visual [...] "classic, kind <b>of</b> <b>sad</b> [...] in romantic black and white", but felt it was confusing and [...] "on-brand...a meticulous homage to nothing in particular".

500|$|The {{title of}} [...] "Compass Point", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a {{reference}} to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was [...] "Back to Earth", {{and was the first}} song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, [...] "There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so we went back to that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it’s just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it’ll be done.' That of course was not the case, and we ended basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves." [...] Frankel called the EP's closer, [...] "Footsteps", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was [...] "Your Favorite Band/Footsteps". As Frankel described coming up with the name, [...] "I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. When I was there, I overheard some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they’re DJing,' and that’s something that happens all the time now. People go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it’s a DJ set. I thought it was kind of funny, and also kind <b>of</b> <b>sad</b> — but in a funny way." [...] While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; [...] "We’re still messing around, because {{we have a lot of}} demos from this last year and a half, and we’re sifting through, figuring out if there’s one more we want to finish." ...|$|E
