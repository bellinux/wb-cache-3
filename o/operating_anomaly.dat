40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether {{market prices}} fully reflect {{the information contained}} in the level of net operating assets about the long-term sustainability of the firm’s financial performance. In our 1964 - 2002 sample, the ratio of net operating assets to beginning total assets (NOA) is a strong negative predictor {{for at least three years}} of future stock returns. Predictability is robust with respect to the use of a characteristic portfolio benchmark matching procedure, Fama-French 3 and 4 -factor benchmarks, and Fama-MacBeth crosssectional monthly regressions using an extensive set of controls for pricing anomalies in the finance literature (market value, the book-to-market ratio, and one-month, 12 -month, and 3 -year past stock returns). Furthermore, the sustainability effect remains after controlling for current and past period operating accruals and the most recent change in net operating assets, and provides higher and statistically more significant hedge profits than the <b>operating</b> accruals <b>anomaly.</b> Controlling for NOA weakens but does not entirely subsume the <b>operating</b> accruals <b>anomaly.</b> A Fama-MacBeth Mishkin test suggests that investors fail to take into account the adverse information contained in NOA about future earnings. 1...|$|R

Using financing constraints to proxy for investment frictions, we show only weak evidence that the investment-to-assets and asset growth effects in the cross section of returns are stronger in financially more constrained firms than in financially less constrained firms. There {{is no evidence that}} q-theory with investment frictions explains the investment growth, net stock issues, abnormal corporate investment, or net <b>operating</b> assets <b>anomalies.</b> Limits-to-arbitrage proxies dominate q-theory with investment frictions in explaining the magnitude of the investment-to-assets and asset growth anomalies in direct comparisons.

40|$|Research {{aircraft}} {{have become}} increasingly dependent on advanced control systems to accomplish program goals. These aircraft are integrating multiple disciplines to improve performance and satisfy research objectives. This integration is being accomplished through electronic control systems. Because {{of the number of}} systems involved and the variety of engineering disciplines, systems design methods and information management have become essential to program success. The primary objective of the system design/information tool for aircraft flight control system is to help transfer flight control system design knowledge to the flight test community. By providing all of the design information and covering multiple disciplines in a structured, graphical manner, flight control systems can more easily be understood by the test engineers. This will provide the engineers with the information needed to thoroughly ground test the system and thereby reduce the likelihood of serious design errors surfacing in flight. The secondary objective is to apply structured design techniques to all of the design domains. By using the techniques in the top level system design down through the detailed hardware and software designs, it is hoped that fewer design anomalies will result. The flight test experiences of three highly complex, integrated aircraft programs are reviewed: the X- 29 forward-swept wing, the advanced fighter technology integration (AFTI) F- 16, and the highly maneuverable aircraft technology (HiMAT) program. Significant <b>operating</b> <b>anomalies</b> and the design errors which cause them, are examined to help identify what functions a system design/information tool should provide to assist designers in avoiding errors...|$|R

40|$|A lack of {{efficient}} {{system software}} {{is an increasing}} impediment to deploying large-scale parallel and distributed systems. Systemically addressing <b>operating</b> system-induced performance <b>anomalies</b> requires accurate, low-overhead, whole-system monitoring, something that is currently unavailable in large tightly-coupled systems. In this paper, we present the design of IMPuLSE—Integrated Monitoring and Profiling for Large-Scale Environments—a system we are developing to meet this need. IMPuLSE’s innovative messagecentric profiling approach trades off of centralized global knowledge for low overhead, while retaining relatively fine-grained information about important cross-host performance interactions. The goal {{of this approach is}} to enable both large-scale system software adaptation and continuous system performance auditing. 1...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{accounting}} studies {{claim that}} investors fail to rationally price accrual-related information and that investors are functionally fixated. This study documents {{the importance of}} performing robustness tests when testing economic or behavioral explanations for apparent accounting-related security mispricing. We find that performing robustness tests that exclude {{a small number of}} firm-year observations (approximately 200 firm-year observations or about 1 % of the entire sample) reveals an inverted U-shaped relation between buy-and-hold abnormal returns and total accruals. An inverted U-shaped relation is inconsistent with the functional fixation (earnings fixation) hypothesis. We conduct similar robustness tests for the abnormal accrual anomaly and the net <b>operating</b> assets <b>anomaly</b> proposed by other investigators, and also find an inverted U-shaped relation between buy-and-hold abnormal returns and abnormal accruals and net operating assets. These findings are inconsistent with the explanations put forth by those investigators. Such evidence leads us to conclude that the accrual-related anomalies are unlikely to be due to investors' inability to process accounting information, as suggested by the functional fixation hypotheses tested.

40|$|In October 1998 a {{mechanical}} cryocooler and cryogenic circulator loop were flown on NASA's STS- 95 {{as part of}} the Hubble Orbital System Test (HOST). The system will be installed on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) during Service Mission # 3 in 2000 and will provide cooling to the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS). It will extend the useful life of that instrument by 5 to 10 years. This was the first successful space demonstration of a turbobrayton cryocooler. The cooler is a single stage reverse Brayton type, using low-vibration high-speed miniature turbomachines for the compression and expansion functions. A miniature centrifugal cryogenic circulator is used to deliver refrigerated neon to the instrument. During the mission, the cooler <b>operated</b> without <b>anomalies</b> for approximately 185 hours over a range of conditions to verify its mechanical, thermodynamic and control functions. The cryocooler satisfied all mission objectives including maximum cooldown to near-design operating conditions, warm and cold starts and stops, operation at near-design temperatures, and demonstration of long-term temperature stability. This paper presents a description of the cooler and its operation during the HOST flight...|$|R
40|$|The {{fast growing}} demand for fresh water-coupled {{with the need to}} protect the {{environment}} has made many areas of India {{and the rest of the}} World vulnerable to water shortages for various uses of the economy. As they interact with Electricity Industry, water availability is critical to power generation. With out access to adequate amounts of water for steam generation and cooling, power plants that rely on heat energy to generate electricity cannot <b>operate.</b> Seasonal <b>anomalies</b> in water systems and electricity production are inextricably linked. A change in one of these systems induces a change in the other. Therefore, there is an imperative need to better understand the interrelationship of Electric Energy- water for effective management of serious water related power generation issues.

40|$|A new {{geopotential}} based vertical coordinate, named View the MathML source, is presented, {{that treats}} external motions as a z*-coordinate, internal low frequency motions in a Eulerian way and high frequency ones in a Lagrangian way. To that purpose, a prognostic equation {{for the low}} frequency horizontal flux divergence is added in the system in order to discriminate between low and high frequency parts of vertical motions. This coordinate keeps the intrinsic advantages of the z-coordinate while enabling a drastic reduction of the spurious diapycnal mixing induced by vertical and lateral schemes truncation errors associated with high frequency motions in level models. An idealised experiment illustrates this property in an internal wave propagation framework. The reduction of Eulerian vertical velocities enables a proportional reduction of the associated advection schemes truncation errors. Following high frequency motions, the View the MathML source-coordinate lets lateral schemes <b>operate</b> along tracer <b>anomalies</b> created by those motions...|$|R
40|$|Isotopic {{heterogeneities}} {{within the}} mantle, as sampled by oceanic volcanism, {{are reported to}} exist on all length scales; unfortunately, this fundamental observation has progressed little beyond the qualitative stage. The isotopic systematics of mid–ocean–ridge basalts (MORBs) and ocean–island basalts (OIBs) are now being used to constrain the efficiency of convective mixing; one datum which could constrain convective mixing calculations is the size spectrum of chemical heterogeneity, but unfortunately this datum does not exist. Here I place quantitative bounds on the size spectrum of mantle heterogeneities, using the variations in ^(87) Sr/^(86) Sr ratios in oceanic basalts over different length scales. The spectrum {{is consistent with a}} flat spectrum filtered by magmatism. Such a white–noise spectrum indicates that there are many sources of anomalies at different wavelengths (with about equal magnitude), or that there is a global–scale source of <b>anomalies</b> <b>operating</b> continuously over thousands of millions of years, or some combination of both models...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} the results from a multidisciplinary study {{carried out in the}} southern branch of the Larderello geothermal field (Travale-Montieri area) that is based on the integration of field data with information of the deeper structures as derived from interpretation of seismic reflection profiles and the P-T-t history of the metamorphic substratum as reconstructed from borehole data. Our data document that the structural and metamorphic signature of the metamorphic substratum is chiefly related to a prograde HT/LP metamorphic overprint, spanning in age from c. 2. 8 to 0. 7 Ma. The metamorphic climax was attained within the K-feldspar zone and equilibrated at P-T conditions of about 650 °C (garnet-biotite thermometry) and 0. 2 GPa (andalusite stability field). We interpret these new findings as the evidence of Pliocene-Pleistocene thermal metamorphism associated with multiple granite intrusions at shallow levels in the crust. These results (i) add strength to the interpretations emphasising the role of Neogene thermal metamorphism on the tectono-metamorphic signature of the basement rocks found at depth in the Larderello geothermal field; and (ii) provide insights on the thermal structures of the crustal section hosting the geothermal field and on the modes through which the long-lived positive thermal <b>anomaly</b> <b>operated</b> in Southern Tuscany...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{we examine}} three {{issues related to}} the accrual and the net <b>operating</b> assets (NOA) <b>anomalies.</b> First, whether mutual funds trade on these anomalies. Second whether they are able to {{generate}} profits, net of transaction costs. Third, the reasons why such profits are not completely exploited. Prior studies provide evidence on the first issue by examining the trading behavior of institutional investors {{in the context of the}} accruals anomaly. However, there is little direct evidence on the second and the third issues. The primary reason, that prior studies do not address these issues is because they use data from 13 F filings. These data provide information on institutional holdings but do not provide information on their fund returns and fund flows, which are important for addressing these issues. We obtain data on mutual fund portfolio holdings from the 13 F filings and on mutual fund returns and fund flows from CRSP. We combine these data and provide the following results. First, mutual funds actively follow both the accrual and the NOA anomalies. Second, funds that follow these anomalies aggressively exhibit significant profits, net of actual transaction costs and fund expenses, suggesting that for the accrual and NOA anomalies transaction costs cannot completely explain the magnitude and persistence of these anomalies. Finally, funds that more aggressively follow the anomalies have higher volatility in fund returns and fund flows, suggesting that residual profits are not completely arbitraged away because of inelastic supply of arbitrage capital induced by arbitrage risks (Shleifer and Vishny 1997) ...|$|R
