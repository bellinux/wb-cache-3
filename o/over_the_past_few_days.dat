Huang Qi is an active rights defender in China. he {{established}} an Internet service company in October 1998 to help search for missing people, and launched a website called Tianwang Xunren on June 4, 1999. Huang Qi was arrested on June 3, 2000, and sentenced to five years imprisonment on May 9, 2003 by the Chengdu Intermediate People's Court for the crime of inciting subversion of state power. During the Sichuan Earthquake, Huang Qi's work and his website were widely reported by media to help find missing people to unite family members. He also wrote many articles about families who lost their children. Although initially tolerating independent reporting, China's security forces have begun {{to clamp down on}} dissent and public complaints. According to Human Rights In China, sources inside China said that on the evening of June 10, 2008, Huang Qi, Pu Fei, a volunteer for Tianwang, and Zuo Xiaohuan, a former teacher at Leshan Teachers College were missing after they were forced into a car by unidentified individuals. In the afternoon of June 12, 2008, Lawyer Xu, Tianwang's legal counsel, went to the Jinyang Police Station of Chengdu to file a missing persons report. The police reportedly told Xu that Huang Qi has been detained, and that the related legal procedure notice would be sent to his family but refused to disclose the grounds for Huang's detention.

500|$|On 19 December, Manstein {{sent his}} chief {{intelligence}} officer—Major Eismann—into Stalingrad to give General Paulus an accurate {{image of the}} strategic situation which had befallen Army Group Don. Paulus was not impressed, although he agreed that the best option continued to be an attempted breakout as early as possible. The 6th Army's Chief of Staff—Major General Arthur Schmidt—argued that a breakout was unfeasible and instead suggested that Army Group Don take steps to better supply entrapped Axis forces by air. Despite agreeing with Eismann earlier, Paulus then decided that a breakout {{was out of the}} question given the 6th Army's incapability to conduct it and Hitler's express orders against it. Although that day the LVII Panzer Corps managed to breakthrough the Alksay River and drive within [...] of the southern edge of the 6th Army's front, the entrapped German forces made no attempt to link up with the relieving forces. [...] Adam makes the point the 6th Army tanks only had fuel to go 30 km, after which they would need fuel and ammunition flown in to go any further. [...] Thereafter, the 6th Army simply did not have the strength to attempt a breakout, operating less than 70 serviceable tanks, with limited supplies, while its infantry were in no condition to attempt an attack in the blizzard which had developed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E

While Latvian Foreign Affairs Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs has banned three popular Russian musicians - Oleg Gazmanov, Joseph Kobzon and Alla Perfilova from travelling to Latvia for an indefinite period of time.
