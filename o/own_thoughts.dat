5|$|The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, BDI-1A, BDI-II), {{created by}} Aaron T. Beck, is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory, {{one of the}} most widely used psychometric tests for {{measuring}} the severity of depression. Its development marked a shift among mental health professionals, who had until then, viewed depression from a psychodynamic perspective, instead of it being rooted in the patient's <b>own</b> <b>thoughts.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the poem}} continues, the narrator begins to focus {{less on the}} {{countryside}} and more on his immediate surroundings. His descriptions move from sensations to his <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> as he begins to emphasise what is not present in the scene; he contrasts an obscure country life with a life that is remembered. This contemplation provokes the narrator's thoughts on the natural process of wastage and unfulfilled potential.|$|E
5|$|Gradually, {{women began}} to author their <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> and {{literary}} works about lesbian relationships. Until {{the publication of}} The Well of Loneliness, most major works involving lesbianism were penned by men. Foster suggests that women would have encountered suspicion about their own lives had they used same-sex love as a topic, and that some writers including Louise Labé, Charlotte Charke, and Margaret Fuller either changed the pronouns in their literary works to male, or made them ambiguous. Author George Sand was portrayed as a character in several works in the 19th century; writer Mario Praz credited the popularity of lesbianism as a theme to Sand's appearance in Paris society in the 1830s. Charlotte Brontë's Villette in 1853 initiated a genre of boarding school stories with homoerotic themes.|$|E

5|$|The {{response}} to the riots on the Chinese blogosphere was markedly more varied than the official response. Despite blocks and censorship, Internet watchers monitored continued attempts by netizens to publish their <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> on {{the causes of the}} incident or vent their anger about the violence. While some bloggers were supportive of the government, others were more reflective of the event's cause. On numerous forums and news sites, government workers quickly removed comments about the riots. Common themes were calls for punishment for those responsible; some posts evoked the name of Wang Zhen, the general who is respected by Hans and other minorities, and feared by many Uyghurs for repression after the communist takeover of Xinjiang in 1949.|$|E
5|$|As with A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan is a bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, {{this time}} from the {{perspective}} of a female character, Tenar. Though she nominally has a position of high authority, Tenar feels trapped by her duties as priestess, and desires to escape to a place where she can make her own choices. In contrast to Ged, whose journey was chiefly a private quest, Tenar's choices have direct social consequences. While Ged's growth is traced through the various adventures he experiences in the first volume of the series, Tenar's development is shown through her exploration of her own domain. The labyrinth, in particular, with its twists and turns, is a metaphor for Tenar's exploration of her <b>own</b> <b>thoughts.</b> In this reading of the novel, the labyrinth symbolizes the imprisonment of the women, and the darkness and unacknowledged thoughts within Tenar, which she begins to struggle through after feeling guilt over killing the prisoners sent to her.|$|E
25|$|According to Welch these revelations were {{accompanied}} by mysterious seizures, and the reports are unlikely to have been forged by later Muslims. Muhammad was confident that he could distinguish his <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> from these messages.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the people}} who incited Lubbertus to write a {{response}} to Grotius's Ordinum Pietas was Johannes Althusius (whom Grotius oddly claimed as influential in his <b>own</b> <b>thought).</b>|$|R
25|$|Daniel Bernoulli {{was pleased}} by the {{similarity}} of Le Sage's model and his <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> {{on the nature of}} gases. However, Bernoulli himself was the opinion that his own kinetic theory of gases was only a speculation, and likewise he regarded Le Sage's theory as highly speculative.|$|E
25|$|Following his death, a dossier was {{compiled}} by his friends detailing {{many of his}} achievements, recorded remarks and memories of him by distinguished officers and men who served with him during his lifetime. It also includes extracts from his <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> and writings. A copy of the dossier has been presented to the Royal Air Force Museum at Hendon.|$|E
25|$|Except for {{the woman}} whose face is {{completely}} {{turned away from the}} viewer, all of the other faces in the painting are to one degree or another in shadow, including that of the dog. None of the women look at each other, each seemingly absorbed in their <b>own</b> <b>thoughts,</b> a fact which contributes to the solemn mood of the piece.|$|E

60|$|For a {{time they}} were silent, each wrapped in his <b>own</b> <b>thought,</b> while the crickets chirped and the frogs sang. From the distant forest came the mournful hoot of an owl.|$|R
25|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} are {{the most}} prevalent type of hallucinations. They include hearing voices and music. Many times an individual suffering from auditory hallucinations will hear a voice or voices saying the individual's <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> out loud, commenting on all their actions, or commanding and ordering the individual around. These voices tend to be negative and critical toward the individual. People who suffer from schizophrenia and have auditory hallucinations will often speak to the voice {{as though they are}} speaking to a second person.|$|E
25|$|Friction arose between de Gaulle and Pétain over Le Soldat, {{a history}} of the French soldier which he had ghost-written and for which he wanted greater writing credit. He had written mainly {{historical}} material, but Pétain wanted to add a final chapter of his <b>own</b> <b>thoughts.</b> There was at least one stormy meeting late in 1926 after which de Gaulle was seen to emerge, white with anger, from Pétain’s office. In October 1926 he returned to his duties with the Headquarters of the Army of the Rhine.|$|E
25|$|While {{living in}} one's body an {{individual}} has conjunction with heaven through the angels, and with each person, {{there are at least}} two evil spirits and two angels. Temptation or pains of conscience originates from a conflict between evil spirits and angels. Due to man's sinful nature it is dangerous to have open direct communication with angels and can only be seen when one's spiritual sight has been opened. Thus from moment to moment angels attempt to lead each person to what is good tacitly using the person's <b>own</b> <b>thoughts.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{the real}} truth, in the saying that second {{thoughts}} are best. Animals have no second thoughts; man alone is able to see his <b>own</b> <b>thought</b> double, as a drunkard sees a lamp-post; man alone is able to see his <b>own</b> <b>thought</b> upside down as one sees {{a house in a}} puddle. This duplication of mentality, as in a mirror, is (we repeat) the inmost thing of human philosophy. There is a mystical, even a monstrous truth, in the statement that two heads are better than one. But they ought both to grow on the same body." ...|$|R
6000|$|The whisper sounded again, {{close at}} my ear. It echoed my <b>own</b> <b>thought,</b> when I called {{to mind the}} ways of killing which history had taught me. It said: [...] "Kill her with the knife." ...|$|R

25|$|Little {{is known}} of Catherine's <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> on the match. While her mother plotted to secure an {{alliance}} with England and thus support in Portugal's fight for independence, and her future husband celebrated his restoration by dallying with his mistresses, Catherine's time had been spent in the sombre seclusion of her convent home, with little opportunity for fun or frivolity. Even outside the convent her actions were governed by the strict etiquette of the royal court of Portugal. By all accounts Catherine grew into a quiet, even-tempered young woman.|$|E
25|$|Charles Wheatstone {{was born}} in Barnwood, Gloucester. His father was a music-seller in the town, who moved to 128 Pall Mall, London, four years later, {{becoming}} a teacher of the flute. Charles, the second son, went to a village school, near Gloucester, and afterwards to several institutions in London. One of them was in Kennington, and kept by a Mrs. Castlemaine, who was astonished at his rapid progress. From another he ran away, but was captured at Windsor, {{not far from the}} theatre of his practical telegraph. As a boy he was very shy and sensitive, liking well to retire into an attic, without any other company than his <b>own</b> <b>thoughts.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{character}} in the play are in poverty and all affected by Hester's past. Five of {{the character}}s give insight, called confessions, of what was their previous sexual experience with Hester, and Hester presents her <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> near the end. The Doctor's confession is how Hester gave herself {{to help him out}} of despair of being alone. The Welfare lady's confession is her first threesome experience thanks to Hester's assistance. Amiga Gringa's confession is what sexual experience Hester and she had to make money together. Reverend D's confession is how Hester's predicament turned him toward God. Finally, Hester's confession is about men's quick love and that she should have thousands of bad children.|$|E
5000|$|Once the {{transfer}} of knowledge complete, the former disciple, or/and his/her followers progressively erase all traces of the original source, repackages the ideas as their <b>own</b> <b>thought,</b> and may even proceed to denigrate the source tradition.|$|R

50|$|In {{the second}} post-war, in a denigratory moment of idealism, and mostly of Actual idealism, accused of {{connivance}} with Fascism, Fazio’s position {{was one of}} open defence of Actual idealism and a faithful development of his <b>own</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|R
25|$|Chomsky {{explains}} {{his decision to}} focus on criticizing the U.S. over other countries as being because, during his lifetime, the country has militarily and economically dominated the world, and because its liberal democratic electoral system allows for the citizenry to exert an influence on government policy. His hope is that, by spreading awareness of the negative impact that imperialism has on the populations affected by it, he can sway {{the population of the}} U.S. and other countries into opposing government policies that are imperialist in their nature. He urges people to criticize the motivations, decisions, and actions of their governments; to accept responsibility for one's <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> and actions; and to apply the same standards to others as one would apply to oneself.|$|E
25|$|Investigation of {{the sense}} of agency is {{important}} to explain positive symptoms of schizophrenia, like thought insertion and delusions of control. The core of the problem met by these patients is a disturbance of their sense of agency: the first rank symptoms, which represent one of the major features of the disease, are nothing but a loss of the ability to attribute their <b>own</b> <b>thoughts,</b> internal speech, covert or overt actions to themselves. Nonattributed or misattributed thoughts and actions then become a material for delusional interpretation and delirium. One primary source reports that the feeling of alien control (i.e., delusions of control) during a movement task in schizophrenic patients is associated with an increased metabolic activity in the right inferior parietal cortex.|$|E
25|$|While the {{enforcement}} in theory {{could lead to}} a Big Brother-style surveillance society, in practice social convention among the Minds prohibits them from watching, or interfering in, citizens' lives unless requested, or unless they perceive severe risk. The practice of reading a sentient's mind without permission (something the Culture is technologically easily capable of) is also strictly taboo. The whole plot of Look to Windward relies on a Hub Mind not reading an agent's mind (with certain precautions in case this rule gets violated). Minds that do so anyway are considered deviant and shunned by other Minds (see GCU Grey Area). At one point it is said that if the Culture actually had written laws, the sanctity of one's <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> against the intrusion of others would be the first on the books (Look To Windward).|$|E
