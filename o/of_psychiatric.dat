5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, {{the scale}} <b>of</b> <b>psychiatric</b> abuses in the past, the use <b>of</b> <b>psychiatric</b> doctrines by the totalitarian state have been thoroughly concealed. The {{archives of the}} Soviet Ministries of Internal Affairs (MVD) and Health (USSR Health Ministry), and of the Serbsky Institute for Forensic Psychiatry, which between them hold evidence about the expansion of psychiatry and the regulations governing that expansion, remain totally closed to researchers, says Gushansky. Dan Healey shares his opinion that the abuses of Soviet psychiatry under Stalin and, even more dramatically, in the 1960s to 1980s remain under-researched: {{the contents of the}} main archives are still classified and inaccessible. Hundreds of files on people who underwent forensic psychiatric examinations at the Serbsky Institute during Stalin's time are on the shelves of the highly classified archive in its basement where Gluzman saw them in 1989. All are marked by numbers without names or surnames, and any biographical data they contain is unresearched and inaccessible to researchers.|$|E

The Kingdom of Evils, {{a book on}} psychiatric social work by Southard and Jarrett, was published after his death.

5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{a disastrous}} factor for domestic psychiatry {{is that those}} who had committed the crime against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way. Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public {{has been reduced to}} making a business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill. In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors <b>of</b> <b>psychiatric</b> research institutes, all the head doctors <b>of</b> <b>psychiatric</b> hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura, which they remained so far. The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg. His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his dissertation. Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.|$|E
5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are also}} used to treat the acute panic caused by {{hallucinogen}} intoxication. Benzodiazepines {{are also used}} to calm the acutely agitated individual and can, if required, be given via an intramuscular injection. They can sometimes be effective in the short-term treatment <b>of</b> <b>psychiatric</b> emergencies such as acute psychosis as in schizophrenia or mania, bringing about rapid tranquillization and sedation until the effects of lithium or neuroleptics (antipsychotics) take effect. Lorazepam is most commonly used but clonazepam is sometimes prescribed for acute psychosis or mania; their long-term use is not recommended due to risks of dependence. Further research investigating the use of benzodiazepines alone and in combination with antipsychotic medications for treating acute psychosis is warranted.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the Soviet {{authorities}} {{began the}} widespread use <b>of</b> <b>psychiatric</b> treatment {{as a form of}} punishment and deterrence for the independent-minded. This involved unlimited detention in a psikhushka, as such places were popularly known, which might be conventional psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric prison-hospitals set up (e.g. the Leningrad Special Psychiatricl Hospital) as part of an existing penal institution. Healthy individuals were held among mentally ill and often dangerous patients; they were forced to take various psychotropic drugs; they might also be incarcerated in prison-type institutions under overall control of the KGB.|$|E

5|$|Reported neuropsychiatric manifestations are anxiety, depression, {{a reduced}} display of {{emotions}} (blunted affect), egocentrism, aggression, and compulsive behavior, {{the latter of}} which can cause or worsen addictions, including alcoholism, gambling, and hypersexuality. Difficulties in recognizing other people's negative expressions have also been observed. The prevalence of these symptoms is highly variable between studies, with estimated rates for lifetime prevalence <b>of</b> <b>psychiatric</b> disorders between 33% and 76%. For many sufferers and their families, these symptoms {{are among the most}} distressing aspects of the disease, often affecting daily functioning and constituting reason for institutionalization. Suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts are more common than in the general population. Often individuals have reduced awareness of chorea, cognitive and emotional impairments.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Ohio, Gottesman studied {{psychology}} for his {{undergraduate and graduate}} degrees, became {{a faculty member at}} various universities, and spent most of his career at the University of Virginia and the University of Minnesota. He is known for researching schizophrenia in identical twins to document the contributions of genetics and the family, social, cultural, and economic environment to the onset, progress, and inter-generational transmission of the disorder. Gottesman has worked with researchers to analyze hospital records and conduct follow-up interviews of twins where one or both were schizophrenic. He has also researched the effects of genetics and the environment on human violence and variations in human intelligence. Gottesman and co-researcher James Shields introduced the word epigenetics—the control of genes by biochemical signals modified by the environment {{from other parts of the}} genome—to the field <b>of</b> <b>psychiatric</b> genetics.|$|E
5|$|According to Robert van Voren, {{although}} for several years, {{especially after the}} implosion of the USSR and during {{the first years of}} Boris Yeltsin's rule, the positions of the Soviet psychiatric leaders were in jeopardy, now one can firmly conclude that they succeeded in riding out the storm and retaining their powerful positions. They also succeeded in avoiding an inflow of modern concepts of delivering mental health care and a fundamental change in the structure <b>of</b> <b>psychiatric</b> services in Russia. On the whole, in Russia, the impact of mental health reformers has been the least. Even the reform efforts made in such places as St. Petersburg, Tomsk, and Kaliningrad have faltered or were encapsulated as centrist policies under Putin brought them back under control.|$|E

He was relieved of his directorship at Boston Psychopathic and named director of the Massachusetts Psychiatric Institute, a unit of Boston Psychopathic. Free of his previous hospital administration duties, Southard was able to concentrate on research. Southard delineated several priorities for his scientific work and writing. He hoped to publish four books; the first would cover observations from his research laboratory made between 1906 and 1919. The second book, on clinical work he had done at Boston Psychopathic since 1912, he hoped would increase enthusiasm for psychiatric hospitals. The third would report on the expansion <b>of</b> <b>psychiatric</b> social work, and the final work (a requirement for his academic post) would be an overview of neuropathology.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 the USSR had 70 {{psychiatric}} hospitals and 21,103 psychiatric beds. By 1935 this had increased to 102 {{psychiatric hospitals}} and 33,772 psychiatric beds, and by 1955 there were 200 psychiatric hospitals and 116,000 psychiatric {{beds in the}} Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities built psychiatric hospitals at a rapid pace and increased the quantity of beds for patients with nervous and mental illnesses: between 1962 and 1974 the number of beds for psychiatric patients increased from 222,600 to 390,000. Such an expansion in the number <b>of</b> <b>psychiatric</b> beds was expected {{to continue in the}} years up to 1980. Throughout this period the dominant trend in Soviet psychiatry ran counter to the vigorous attempts in Western countries to treat as many as possible as out-patients rather than in-patients.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Moscow Helsinki Group {{chairwoman}} Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility <b>of</b> <b>psychiatric</b> practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense. Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} from the 1960-s to 1986, the abuse of {{psychiatry}} for political purposes {{was reported to have}} been systematic in the Soviet Union and episodic in other Eastern European countries such as Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility <b>of</b> <b>psychiatric</b> practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community. Psychiatrists have been involved in human rights abuses in states across the world when the definitions of mental disease were expanded to include political disobedience. As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions have at times classified threats to authority during periods of political disturbance and instability as a form of mental disease. In many countries political prisoners are still sometimes confined and abused in mental institutions.|$|E
5|$|Following Louisa's {{persistent}} claims {{regarding the}} divinity of Henry Prince, her mother enlisted medical aid and had Louisa certified insane and then placed her in Moorcroft House Asylum, Hillingdon. Her treatment and forced incarceration in the asylum has remained of interest {{with respect to}} the rights <b>of</b> <b>psychiatric</b> patients; Dr Arthur Stillwell, the presiding physician, made notes on Louisa's condition and treatment, recorded in The Lancet. Louisa escaped from the asylum in January 1848, travelling across London to meet the Reverend William Cobbe from The Agapemone at a hotel in Cavendish Square, but was recaptured two days later at Paddington railway station. Cobbe alerted the Commissioners in Lunacy, whose report by Bryan Procter led to her release in May 1848. Louisa then sued her brother, cousin and brother-in-law, Frederick Ripley, for abduction and false imprisonment in Nottidge v. Ripley and Another (1849); the trial was reported daily in The Times newspaper. In 1860 Louisa's brother, Ralph Nottidge, sued Prince to recoup the money that Louisa had given him {{as a result of his}} undue influence over her, in the case of Nottidge v. Prince (1860). The Nottidges won the case, with costs. After the cases were resolved Louisa Nottidge returned to Spaxton and spent the rest of her life as one of the Agapemonites.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Russian Federation {{had one of}} {{the highest}} levels <b>of</b> <b>psychiatric</b> beds per capita in Europe at 113.2 per 100,000 {{population}}, or more than 161,000 beds. In 2014, Russia has 104.8 beds per 100,000 population and no actions have been taken to arrange new facilities for outpatient services. Persons who do not respond well to treatment at dispensaries can be sent to long-term social care institutions (internats) wherein they remain indefinitely. The internats are managed by oblast Social Protection ministries. Russia had 442 psychoneurologic internats by 1999, and their number amounted to 505 by 2013. The internats provided places for approximately 125,000 people in 2007. In 2013, Russian psychoneurologic internats accommodated 146,000 people, according to the consolidated data of the Department of Social Protection of Moscow and the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Russian Federation. It is supposed that the number of beds in internats is increasing at the same rate with which the number of beds is decreasing in psychiatric hospitals. Lyubov Vinogradova of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia provides the different figure of 122,091 or 85.5 places in psychoneurologic institutions of social protection (internats) per 100,000 population in 2013 and says that Russia is high on Europe's list of the number of places in the institutions. Vinogradova states that many regions have the catastrophic shortage of places in psychoneurological internats, her words point out to the need {{to increase the number of}} places there and to the fact that the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia is forcing transinstitutionalization—relocating the mentally ill from their homes and psychiatric hospitals to psychoneurological internats.|$|E
