Instead, however, of censuring the accused, he applies to the man's own conscience. [...] "Does your conscience," [...] says he, [...] "acquit you of having acted wrong?" [...] The accused makes no reply; and then Mr. Hastings, by an hypothetical conclusion, acquits him.|$|E

In retaliation the Protestant leader, the Duke of Châtelherault, sent his son the Earl of Arran and the Master of Maxwell to seize Bothwell's home Crichton Castle and force the Earl, who was at Borthwick, to join them. Bothwell remained true to the Regent, though it was said in January he was [...] "weary of his part".

2500|$|While, by 1765, it {{was able}} to take in 324$861 réis in receipts, while {{expending}} 302$000 réis (a meager profit), by 1804 the situation had turned grave. The brotherhood of the Misericórdia {{sent a letter to the}} Crown, informing it of [...] "grave financial situation" [...] that existed in the Santa Casa, referring to corruption of the previous board. In their communique, the former brotherhood of not paying the expenses; of taking monies belonging to the Santa Casa; <b>of</b> embezzling <b>moneys</b> <b>destined</b> to it from a benefactor (José de Araújo Pereira, who had died in Rio de Janeiro in 1787, leaving behind 4000 cruzados); and of pocketing accumulated interest from these receipts. Upon receiving these charges, the Prince Regent ordered an inspection of the state of the finances of Santa Casa, sending in an administrator/auditor from the comarca of Viana do Castelo. It was only in 1807 when the review was officially begun into the accounts of the Misericórdia. The 1787 auditor, Bento Manuel Machado de Araújo, explained that he had taken 1200$000 from the benefactor, but had made all the necessary provisions. Regardless, the analysis by auditors between 1774 and 1804 revealed a debit of 1789$869 réis, but that the Misericórdia had not received 11553$949 in outstanding payments. This analysis only helped to confirm the decision of the Administrator General of the district of Viana do Castelo in 1838: a majority of the Misericórdias were badly administrated, resulting in the loss of funds, that was treated by their administration with little zeal. In 1839, the same administrator sent a financial commissioner to reform the bureaucracy, examine the errors and clean up the sloppiness in the Misericórdia of Valadares.|$|R

In 1831 he started work as a stagecoach driver between Nashua and Exeter, soon moving to the route between Nashua and Keene. The stage did a brisk {{business}} due to the dearth of rail lines at the time.

2500|$|James Shikwati, a Kenyan economist, {{has argued}} that foreign aid causes harm to the {{recipient}} nations, specifically because aid is distributed by local politicians, finances the creation of corrupt government such as that led by Dr Fredrick Chiluba in Zambia bureaucracies, and hollows out the local economy. [...] In an interview in Germany's Der Spiegel magazine, Shikwati uses the example of food aid delivered to Kenya {{in the form of}} a shipment of corn from America. Portions of the corn may be diverted by corrupt politicians to their own tribes, or sold on the black market at prices that undercut local food producers. Similarly, Kenyan recipients of donated Western clothing will not buy clothing from local tailors, putting the tailors out of business.

After compromising with legislative leaders and Mayor Hannemann, however, she allowed the bill to become law.

[...] A month later, the Honolulu City Council authorized the one-half percent GET increase, and Hannemann signed the measure into law on August 24. Act 247 required Honolulu to use the funds only for the construction and operation of a mass transit system, and barred its use for public roads and other existing transit systems, such as TheBus. Since no other county authorized the excise tax increase before the deadline of December 31, 2005, the Hawaii GET remains at 4% for Hawaii's three other counties. The increase went into effect on January 1, 2007, and was due to expire on December 31, 2022.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} concept <b>of</b> utility <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> The latter {{is defined as}} the ability to {{generate}} additional income. Utility <b>of</b> <b>money</b> is maximized by equalizing dynamic marginal utility <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and marginal cost. The subsequent differential equation links up income velocity <b>of</b> <b>money</b> acceleration and equilibrium convergence. It is proved that individuals’ utility <b>of</b> <b>money</b> maximization objectives may be aggregated at macro level and can be used for monetary policy optimization. Lagrangian multipliers technique is applied to obtain a relationship between income velocity <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and some supplementary constraints. The paper also makes distinction between short-term and long-term utility <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> Conclusions about different types of monetary policies are derived.

The result shows that {{relationship between}} inflation and volatility <b>of</b> <b>money</b> with velocity <b>of</b> <b>money</b> exists in Indonesia, {{but it does}} not in Thailand.
