5|$|In cold or inclement weather, several {{nightjar}} {{species can}} slow their metabolism {{and go into}} torpor, notably the common poorwill, which will maintain that state for weeks. The European nightjar has been observed in captivity {{to be able to}} maintain a state of torpor for at least eight days without harm, but the relevance <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> wild birds is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Billy and Stu {{discuss their}} plan to kill Sidney and frame the murder spree on her father, {{whom they have}} taken hostage. The pair also reveal that they, not Cotton, murdered her mother, Maureen, as she {{was having an affair}} with Billy's father, which drove his mother away. Gale, who survived the crash, intervenes, and Sidney takes {{advantage}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> turn the tables on her attackers, killing Stu. Randy is revealed to be wounded but alive. Billy attacks Sidney but she shoots him through the head, killing him. As the sun rises and police arrive, a badly injured Dewey is taken away by ambulance and Gale makes an impromptu news report about the night's events.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{bivalves}} in {{the order}} Unionoida have a different lifecycle. Sperm is drawn into a female's gills with the inhalant water and internal fertilization takes place. The eggs hatch into glochidia larvae that develop within the female's shell. Later they are released and attach themselves parasitically to the gills or fins of a fish host. After several weeks they drop off their host, undergo metamorphosis and develop into juveniles on the substrate. An advantage <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> the molluscs {{is that they can}} disperse upstream along with their temporary hosts, rather than being constantly swept downstream by the water flow.|$|E

5|$|Tennessee Eastman {{was hired}} to manage Y-12. Y-12 {{initially}} enriched the uranium-235 content to between 13% and 15%, and shipped the first few hundred grams <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> Los Alamos laboratory in March 1944. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the uranium feed emerged as final product. The rest was splattered over equipment in the process. Strenuous recovery efforts helped raise production to 10% of the uranium-235 feed by January 1945. In February the Alpha racetracks began receiving slightly enriched (1.4%) feed from the new S-50 thermal diffusion plant. The next month it received enhanced (5%) feed from the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. By April 1945 K-25 was producing uranium sufficiently enriched to feed directly into the Beta tracks.|$|E
5|$|The UFA {{was in an}} {{uncertain}} position when Reid became Premier; besides Brownlee's resignation, longtime Minister of Public Works Oran McPherson {{was in the midst}} of a scandalous divorce and had also left cabinet, and UFA MLAs Peter Miskew and Omer St. Germain had crossed the floor to the Liberals. Additionally, the province's economic condition remained poor. Liberal leader William R. Howson tried to take advantage <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> undermine the government and position himself as the province's next Premier; he attacked Reid relentlessly for what he alleged were spendthrift habits, and suggested the province's tax rates were causing the confiscation of family homes. Reid asserted in response that Alberta's taxes had decreased since 1921, and criticised Howson for simultaneously attacking government spending and demanding new infrastructure projects.|$|E
5|$|When the Manhattan Project assumed {{responsibility}} {{for the development of}} nuclear weapons in September 1942, it also assumed {{responsibility for}} the development of suitable countermeasures. At the time, the threat posed by the German nuclear energy project was taken very seriously. Consideration was given to issuing a public warning of the danger of a German nuclear attack on the United States, but the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., considered the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> be sufficiently remote that he rejected the notion of taking so drastic a step.|$|E
