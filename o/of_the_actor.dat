5|$|The list {{does not}} include the 1913 film The Vengeance of Galora, which Barrymore wrote. Although some sources list him as also {{appearing}} in the film, his biographers, James Kotsilibas-Davis and Margot Peters, separately state he did not. Kotsilibas-Davis also lists Fighting Blood (1911), My Hero (1912) and The Musketeers of Pig Alley (1912) as films in which Barrymore did not appear, despite claims of other biographers to the contrary; Peters does not list the films in her filmography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actor.</b>|$|E
5|$|To provide {{realistic}} bodies while {{preventing the}} corpses from moving, {{after a lengthy}} casting process the crew chose extras who could lie as still as possible. For the bath house owner Tsuyako Yamashita, this was not possible owing {{to the need to}} see her alive first, and a search for a body double was unfruitful. Ultimately, the crew used digital effects to transplant a still image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actor</b> during the character's funeral scene, allowing for a realistic effect.|$|E

5|$|For {{the scene}} in which Ash is {{revealed}} to be an android, a puppet was created of the character's torso and upper body which was operated from underneath. During a preview screening of the film, this scene caused an usher to faint. In the following scene, Ash's head is placed on a table and re-activated; for portions of this scene, an animatronic head was made using a face cast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actor,</b> Ian Holm. However, the latex of the head shrank while curing {{and the result was}} not entirely convincing. For the bulk of the scene, Holm knelt under the table with his head coming up through a hole. Milk, caviar, pasta, fiber optics, and glass marbles were combined to form the android's innards.|$|E
5|$|Franken met his wife, Franni Bryson, in {{his first}} year at Harvard. In 2005, they moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota. Together they have two children. Their daughter, Thomasin, has degrees from Harvard and the French Culinary Institute; she is the {{director}} of extended learning at DC Prep, an organization in Washington, D.C., that manages charter schools. Their son, Joseph, works in the finance industry. Franken is a second cousin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actor</b> Steve Franken, known for his appearances in the television series The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis. In 2013, Franken received the Stewart B. McKinney Award for his work fighting homelessness.|$|E
5|$|He used actors {{of diverse}} backgrounds, from famous film stars {{to people who}} {{had never seen a}} film (as in Aparajito). Robin Wood and others have lauded him as the best {{director}} of children, pointing out memorable performances in the roles of Apu and Durga (Pather Panchali), Ratan (Postmaster) and Mukul (Sonar Kella). Depending on the talent or experience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actor,</b> Ray varied the intensity of his direction, from virtually nothing with actors such as Utpal Dutt, to using the actor as a puppet (Subir Banerjee as young Apu or Sharmila Tagore as Aparna). Actors who had worked for Ray praised his customary trust but said he could also treat incompetence with total contempt.|$|E

5|$|In January 1995 Hordern {{was invited}} {{back to his}} old college in Brighton, where a room was named in his honour. Inside, the college had {{commissioned}} the sculptor Peter Webster to create a bronze bust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actor</b> which is displayed with a plaque. Hordern's last physical acting role came shortly afterwards as Lord Langland in the comedy film A Very Open Prison. This was followed by two narration performances, firstly in Spode A History of Excellence, {{and then in the}} five-part film Dinosaurs and Their Living Relatives.|$|E
5|$|Laurence Olivier, {{who died}} in 1989, posthumously appears as the villain and mad {{scientist}} Dr. Totenkopf. His likeness was produced using digitally manipulated archival BBC footage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actor</b> and thus adding one more film to his repertoire. A similar move was made two years later in Superman Returns (2006) with Marlon Brando. Avnet cultivated a calculated release for the movie by first moving its release date from the summer (it was supposed to open a week before Spider-Man 2 (2004)) to September, then courting the Internet press and finally making an appearance at the San Diego Comic Con with key cast members {{in an attempt to}} generate some advance buzz.|$|E
5|$|Meyer added {{elements}} {{to reinforce the}} aging of the characters. Kirk's unhappiness about his birthday is compounded by McCoy's gift of reading glasses. The script stated that Kirk was 49, but Shatner was unsure about being specific about Kirk's age. Bennett remembers that Shatner was hesitant about portraying a middle-aged version of himself, and believed that with proper makeup he could continue playing a younger Kirk. Bennett convinced Shatner that he could age gracefully like Spencer Tracy; the producer did not know that Shatner had worked with Tracy on Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), and was fond <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actor.</b> Meyer made sure to emphasize Kirk's parallel to Sherlock Holmes in that both characters waste away in the absence of their stimuli; new cases, in Holmes' case, and starship adventures in Kirk's.|$|E

5|$|The {{characterization}} of Neville Sinclair {{was inspired by}} movie star Errol Flynn, or rather by the image of Flynn that had been popularized by Charles Higham's unauthorized and fabricated biography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actor,</b> in which he asserted that Flynn was, among other things, a Nazi spy. The film's Neville Sinclair is, like Higham's Flynn, a movie star known {{for his work in}} swashbuckler roles, and who is secretly a Nazi spy. Because Higham's biography of Flynn was not refuted until the late 1980s, the image of Flynn as a closet Nazi remained current all through the arduous process of writing and re-writing the script. The other real-life characterization was of Howard Hughes.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} 4 June 1979. The scenes featuring the film team were shot first with handheld 16mm cameras in a cinéma vérité style that mimicked an observational documentary. After shooting {{with the film}} team was completed, Kerman flew down to film his scenes in the rainforest and then to New York to film exterior shots in the city. The interior shots of New York were later filmed in a studio in Rome. Production on the film was delayed numerous times while filming in the Amazon. After the original actor to play Alan Yates dropped out, filming was halted for two weeks as new casting calls began, and the crew awaited the arrival of Yorke from New York City. During principal filming with Kerman, the father <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actor</b> who played Miguel was murdered, and production was again halted as the actor flew back to Bogotá to attend his father's funeral.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry and Barrett {{had begun}} an affair {{by the early}} days of Star Trek, and he {{specifically}} wrote the part of the character Number One in the pilot with her in mind; no other actresses were considered for the role. Barrett suggested Nimoy for the part of Spock. He had worked with both Roddenberry and Barrett on The Lieutenant, and once Roddenberry remembered the thin features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actor,</b> he did not consider anyone else for the part. The remaining cast came together; filming began on November 27, 1964, and was completed on December 11. After post-production, the episode was shown to NBC executives and it was rumored that Star Trek would be broadcast at 8:00pm on Friday nights. The episode failed to impress test audiences, and after the executives became hesitant, Katz offered to make a second pilot. On March 26, 1965, NBC ordered a new episode.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} Siddharth {{was because of}} the sheer {{relevance}} to the character in real life. However, they finalized the choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actor</b> only after the script was ready. The choice of Genelia was based on her natural vivacity in real life. This and her eyes, according to Bhaskar, made her an obvious choice for her character. More so, she liked the one line story that Raju told and also a few scenes that he narrated to her. She immediately liked the character and consented for the role. The fact that her co-actor, Siddharth and she acted earlier together in Boys (2003), made them more comfortable to work with. The camaraderie that the lead actors shared during the filming, added to their good performances. The choice of Prakash Raj was easy as he befitted the character he portrayed while, Jayasudha was persuaded {{to play the role of}} the lead actor's mother.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the crashed plane, in which Hank discovers a dead pilot and the $4.4 million in cash, was filmed on a soundstage. A second plane, designed to have frosted windows, was attached to a gimbal, about five feet off the ground. To match the interior with footage shot in Wisconsin, the art department built a set with real trees and a painted backdrop. To depict Hank being attacked by a flock of crows inside the plane, puppets were used to attack Paxton as he appeared on screen, while two live crows were used to attack an animatronic replica <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actor.</b> A separate soundstage was used to create two sets depicting the interiors of the Mitchell home, where Hank and his wife Sarah (Fonda) reside. The first set was the main floor an exterior entrance way, and the second was created for the upstairs bedrooms. Principal photography concluded on March 13, 1998, after 55 days of filming.|$|E
5|$|The pseudo-tracking shot {{in which}} the camera appears to {{approach}} the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect Méliès had invented the previous year for the film The Man with the Rubber Head. Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor, he set a pulley-operated chair upon a rail-fitted ramp, placed the actor (covered up to the neck in black velvet) on the chair, and pulled him toward the camera. In addition to its technical practicality, this technique also allowed Méliès to control {{the placement of the}} face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed. A substitution splice allowed a model capsule to suddenly appear in the eye <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actor</b> playing the Moon, completing the shot. Another notable sequence in the film, the plunge of the capsule into real ocean waves filmed on location, was created through multiple exposure, with a shot of the capsule falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean. The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of the capsule floating back to the surface, created by combining a moving cardboard cutout of the capsule with an aquarium containing tadpoles and air jets. The descent of the rocket from the Moon was covered in four shots, taking up about twenty seconds of film time.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social {{dynamics}} among cooperative and competitive actors interacting on a complex network {{that has a}} small-world topology. In this model, <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> each <b>actor</b> depends on its previous state in time, its inertia to change, and <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> its neighboring actors. Using numerical simulations, we determine how <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> final states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> and measures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distances between <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> at local and global levels, depend on <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> cooperative to competitive <b>actors</b> and <b>the</b> connectivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> in <b>the</b> network. We find that similar numbers of cooperative and competitive <b>actors</b> yield <b>the</b> lowest values for the local and global measures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distances between <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actors.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, when <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> either cooperative or competitive <b>actors</b> dominate <b>the</b> system, then the divergence is largest between <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actors.</b> Our findings make new testable predictions on how <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> a conflict depends on the strategies chosen by groups of actors and also have implications for <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> behaviors...|$|R
