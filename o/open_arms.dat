40|$|Abstract: B-carboline {{alkaloids}} such as harmaline and nicotine {{are naturally}} {{present in the}} human food chain. Plants which contain B-caroline have anxiety and hallucinogenic effects. In this study the change in like – anxiety behaviors was investigated after intra- amygdala injections of nicotine and harmaline and intra action of them in male rat. Different doses of Harmaline, Nicotine and its compounds were applied for 30 minutes, before test of anxiety injection to (CeA) amygdale. Then like anxiety behavior include <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> time and Locomotor activity, spent <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> time, entriar <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> in maze were examined for 5 minute. Bilateral injection of Harmaline and Nicotine was decreased in to (CeA) amygdale one-by- one <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> times in control group. Injections of effective does of Nicotine could increase anxiety effects of Harmaline. Furthermore, Injection of ineffective doses of drugs has increased anxiety. The results show that Harmaline and Nicotine have anxiety effects. Also muscarinic and Nicotine receptor have important role in Like- anxiety behaviors. Acetylcholine in CeA amygdale thorough Nicotine receptors caused anxiety behaviors. Joined injection increased them effective...|$|R

5|$|On House's insistence, {{neurologist}} Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) and Cameron {{break into}} Adler's house {{to find anything}} that might account for Adler's symptoms. They find an opened package of non-kosher ham in Adler's kitchen. House concludes that Adler is suffering from cysticercosis due to eating undercooked pork; when the tapeworm inside of her reproduced, its larvae were absorbed into her blood stream, infesting her brain. Adler, wishing to die with dignity, refuses to accept more treatments unless {{there is evidence that}} the diagnosis is correct, but House attempts to persuade her otherwise. During the conversation, Adler asks for the cause of the limp in House's right leg. House reveals he had an infarction in his thigh muscles that led to muscle death, which could have been avoided if his doctor had made the correct diagnosis. House is ready to dismiss the case when Chase provides an idea for noninvasive evidence of Adler's tapeworm infection; by taking an X-ray of her leg, House proves that Adler is infested with tapeworms and her condition is treatable. After seeing the evidence, Adler agrees to take her medication to kill the tapeworms.

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{valerian}} extracts induces anxiolytic and sedative effects via the interference with GABAergic system. Since, central adrenergic system {{plays an important role in}} the anxiety-related behaviors, this study aimed to investigate the involvement of this system in the anxiolytic effect of hydro-alcoholic extract of Valeriana officinalis in adult male mice. Materials and Methods: In this study, 63 mice were randomly divided into seven groups. Anxiety-related behaviors of mice were evaluated using the elevated plus maze by recording of the percentage of time the mice spent in the <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> and percentage of <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> entry. All drugs (saline, valeriana extract and epinephrine) were injected intraperitoneally 30 minutes before the test of anxiety. Results: The valeriana extract decreased the anxiety-related behavior by increasing the percentage of time spent in the <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> and percentage of <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> entry. Epinephrine, when injected before the extract, decreased the anxiolytic effect of valeriana extract, whereas the same dose of epinephrine alone did not have any significant effect on the anxiety. Conclusion: It seems that the central adrenergic mechanisms may probably involve in the effect of hydro-alcoholic extract of valeriana on the reduction of the anxiety-related behaviors in mice...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{serotonin}} {{in depression}} and anxiety is still highly controversial. In this experiment the effect of two substances upon anxiety was studied in rats. Methods: Forty adult (45 – 55 weeks old) male Wistar rats were used to study the following behavioral parameters on elevated plus maze test: <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> and closed <b>arm</b> entries; <b>open</b> <b>arm,</b> closed arm and central square activity duration, <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> preference and total distance traveled. Results: A single injected dose of the antidepressant fluoxetine had no significant effect on animals` activity in the open-arm test, neither in a small dosage (5 mg/kgbw) nor in a higher one (10 mg/kgbw), whereas a single high dose of buspirone significantly impeded the open-arm activity of the rats. None of the substances influenced the general locomotor activity significantly, but the higher doses of buspirone mainly blocked the closed-arm entries and they even decreased the total distance traveled. Conclusion: Acute fluoxetine and buspirone administration influenced the rats’ behavior in the elevated plus-maze test in a dose dependent manner. Anxiolytic effects occur after small doses but anxiogenic-like effects were noticed in rodents when higher doses were used.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of two selective serotonin 2 C (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT 2 C) receptor-acting compounds into the ventral hippocampus (VH) of rats exposed to the elevated plus-maze (EPM). In the first experiment, rats {{were exposed to the}} EPM 10 min following VH infusions of either vehicle or the selective 5 -HT 2 C-receptor agonist RO- 60 - 0175 (0. 3, 1. 0, 3. 0 and 10. 0 µg). In addition to conventional parameters of <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> exploration (i. e. percentages of <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> entries and of time spent in these arms), risk assessment-related behaviors were recorded as anxiety-like measures in EPM scoring. RO- 60 - 0175 selectively decreased <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> exploration at the dose of 1. 0 µg, while inducing locomotor-suppressant effects at the two highest doses. In the second experiment, VH infusions of the selective 5 -HT 2 C antagonist RS 102221 (0. 75, 1. 25 and 2. 5 µg) did not affect <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> exploration, while reducing risk assessment in the closed ones. This behavioral profile of risk assessment is suggestive of an anxiolytic-like action. These results further corroborate our previous findings showing that VH 5 -HT 2 C receptor activation elicits anxiogenic-like and locomotor-suppressant effects, and suggest that the selective blockade of this receptor is accompanied by an anxiolytic-like action as detected by ethologically derived measures in the EPM.

40|$|Low {{frequency}} stimulation (LFS) {{has been}} shown to reverse long term potentiation (LTP) and block kindled seizures. Based on the premise that kindling-induced long term potentiation (LTP) in right basolateral amygdala (BLA) circuits increases anxiety, LFS should reverse kindling-induced anxious behavior. Ninety male Wistar rats were kindled in the right BLA to 4 stage 5 seizures, then administered right or bilateral BLA-LFS for 7 days. Kindling decreased <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> behavior and risk assessment in the elevated plus maze relative to control. Right LFS had no effect on behavior or seizures. Bilateral LFS increased <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> behavior and risk assessment to control levels on day 1, but did not block seizures. Risk assessment but not <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> behavior remained elevated 3 weeks later. Based on a study showing that amygdala LFS produces facilitation unless primed, it was concluded that the unprimed right BLA-LFS facilitated an already robust LTP, having a negligible effect on behavior and seizures. Unprimed left BLA-LFS, however, combined with seizure spread from kindling to produce a potentiation of the left BLA. As left BLA kindling is known to be anxiolytic, this would oppose the effect of right BLA kindling...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: The {{adrenergic}} {{system is}} known to have modulatory influence on anxiety-related behaviour both in human and animals. Dorsal hippocampus is an important brain site in modulation of neurotransmittery and neuroendocrinology of anxiety. The present study, was designed to evaluate the interactions between adrenergic and opioidergic systems in dorsal hippocampus on anxiety. Materials and methods: The male Wistar rats, weighting 200 - 250 grams, were used. At the time of surgery the animals were anesthetized and placed in the stereotaxic apparatus and were cannulated bilaterally. The elevated plus-maze was used to measure the anxiety. Percentage of <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> time (OAT%) and <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> entry(OAE%) was used for evaluation of anxiety. Results: Intra peritoneal administration of morphine (6 mg/kg) increased the percentage of <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> time (OAT%) in anxiety test, indicating anxiolytic-like effect.

40|$|Grooming {{behavior}} {{has been reported}} to be a response to novelty and other stressors. However, studies that sought to identify anxiety-related measures in the elevated plus-maze have not found grooming as a reliable index. Grooming has been implied with dearousal after a stressful experience. In the present work, a detailed investigation of this behavior was performed in a test with a longer duration (i. e., 10 min) than the usual duration in the elevated plus-maze. The level of anxiety was manipulated prior to the test by confining male rats to environments known to differ in the degree of aversive stimulation, including a familiar cage, a closed arm of the elevated plus-maze, and an <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> (i. e., the most aversive arm) of the elevated plus-maze. Grooming behavior was classified into three constituent elements: rostral grooming, head grooming, and body grooming. The groups were compared with regard to conventional measures of the elevated plus-maze and grooming behavior. Prior confinement to an <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> led to a delayed effect of decreased open-arm exploration undetectable {{during the first half of}} the test compared with rats previously confined to a closed arm. Prior confinement to an <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> also increased the total duration of grooming during the second half of the test. These increases were found to be partially attributable to increases in the rostral element of grooming. The percentage of interrupted bouts was also found to discriminate the group previously confined to an <b>open</b> <b>arm.</b> These results indicate that prolongation of the session can reveal effects that are otherwise undetectable and that under such conditions some grooming measures can be useful in the evaluation of anxiety-like behavior...|$|R
