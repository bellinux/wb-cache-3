40|$|Background and Purpose: Fruits and {{vegetables}} are natural suppliers of potassium, bicarbonate, or bicarbonate precursors such as citrate, malate and others-hence, possessing potential effects on citraturia. We aimed to compare the acute effects of a noncitrus (melon) fruit vs citric ones (orange and lime) on citraturia and other lithogenic parameters. Patients and Methods: Two-hour urine samples were collected from 30 hypocitraturic stone-forming patients after an overnight fast and 2, 4, and 6 hours after the consumption of 385 mL (13 oz) of either freshly squeezed <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> (<b>n</b> = 10), freshly blended melon <b>juice</b> (<b>n</b> = 10), or freshly squeezed lime <b>juice</b> (<b>n</b> = 10). Urinary citrate, potassium, pH, and other lithogenic parameters were determined and net gastrointestinal alkali absorption (NGIA) was calculated. Potential renal acid load (PRAL) and pH from juices were determined. Results: Significant and comparable increases of mean urinary citrate were observed in all groups, whereas mean urinary potassium, pH, and NGIA were significantly increased only after consumption of melon and <b>orange</b> <b>juices.</b> the pH of melon juice was higher and the PRAL value was more negative compared with <b>orange</b> <b>juice,</b> indicating a higher alkalinity. Conclusions: These findings suggested that melon, a noncitrus source of potassium, citrate, and malate, yielded an increase in urinary citrate excretion equivalent to that provided by orange, and hence represents another dietary alternative {{for the treatment of}} hypocitraturic stone-formers. Despite its low potassium content, lime also produced comparable increases in citraturia possibly because of its high citric acid content.

Urinary calcium was not significantly different, but urinary oxalate was higher during the <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> phase.

A common titration technique was used to calculate the ascorbic acid concentration in the <b>orange</b> <b>juices.</b> With the help of the reagents indophenol (blue colored indicator), metaphosphoric acid and ascorbic acid, standard values of ascorbic acid was collected to use in the formula which is used to determine the ascorbic acid concentration in the <b>orange</b> <b>juice.</b> By the use of indophenol in the titration, the color of the <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> solution will turn into pink as the indophenol nullifies the ascorbic acid content in the <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> solution. The volume of indophenol solution will be recorded in order to use in the formula which is to find the amount of ascorbic acid in the <b>orange</b> <b>juice.</b> Moreover, the blank trial and standardization data are recorded to be used in the same formula.
