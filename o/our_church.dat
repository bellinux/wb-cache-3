25|$|Originally, the Church was to {{be known}} as Church of the Resurrection, but was changed to Church of the Risen Christ as the former term was found to be rather {{abstract}} and impersonal. A quotation from the souvenir magazine published in conjunction with the Church’s official opening cites the following rationale: “The name RISEN CHRIST expresses in a better way the unique character of the Easter event. We believe in a Risen Christ. We believe that He is alive and that we have a relationship with God through Him. <b>Our</b> <b>Church</b> stands as a permanent witness to such a faith”.|$|E
25|$|But {{my family}} {{acquired}} {{in the time of}} my father a plot of land upper than Mart Moura. It is called Marg el-Dayr and it belonged to the family Mousa. Its conversion into an orchard caused the cleaning of an oratory in decline devoted to Saint Augustine. Would it be rather there the place of celebration of the synod? I prefer to believe it because the place in question is on the border of the famous village of Bqoufa, also ruined, but from which we know that the prelates of the family Rizzi are originated, prelates who led <b>our</b> <b>Church</b> in those times with three successive patriarchs.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, in {{a lawsuit}} against <b>our</b> <b>church,</b> a woman accused my husband and three others of molesting her twenty-five years earlier. She didn’t {{remember}} the alleged “abuses” before her thirties, and then believed she was recovering lost memories. She also imagined that 18 people witnessed the abuse, and she listed them by name. However, none of those named supported her stories of abuse. Montgomery County police investigated and filed no charges. After eighteen months, an independent investigator concluded her accusations likely never happened. But that didn’t spare us from a witch hunt. In the initial months, the accused were labeled child sex offenders {{and the story of}} the abuse, truth be damned, was aggressively promoted in news, radio and social media.|$|E

[...] In Fall 2008 Mullen left the church, joining a group of Chanology protesters across the street. Church of Scientology Manhattan President John Carmichael issued a response the following week, stating [...] "Mandy Mullen's story about Scientology... is all lies {{in the service of}} Anonymous, a hate group that targets <b>our</b> <b>Church,</b> or even anyone who just falls onto their radar."

500|$|William III's {{birthday}} fell on 4November, and for orthodox Whigs the {{two days}} therefore became an important double anniversary. [...] William ordered that the thanksgiving service for 5November be amended to include thanks for his [...] "happy arrival" [...] and [...] "the Deliverance of <b>our</b> <b>Church</b> and Nation". In the 1690s he re-established Protestant rule in Ireland, and the Fifth, occasionally marked by the ringing of church bells and civic dinners, was consequently eclipsed by his birthday commemorations. [...] From the 19th century, 5November celebrations there became sectarian in nature. [...] Its celebration in Northern Ireland remains controversial, unlike in Scotland where bonfires continue to be lit in various cities. [...] In England though, as one of 49official holidays, for the ruling class 5November became overshadowed by {{events such as the}} birthdays of Admiral Edward Vernon, or John Wilkes, and under George II and George III, {{with the exception of the}} Jacobite Rising of 1745, it was largely [...] "a polite entertainment rather than an occasion for vitriolic thanksgiving". [...] For the lower classes, however, the anniversary was a chance to pit disorder against order, a pretext for violence and uncontrolled revelry. At some point, for reasons that are unclear, it became customary to burn Guy Fawkes in effigy, rather than the pope. [...] Gradually, Gunpowder Treason Day became Guy Fawkes Day. [...] In 1790 The Times reported instances of children [...] "...begging for money for Guy Faux", and a report of 4November 1802 described how [...] "a set of idle fellows... with some horrid figure dressed up as a Guy Faux" [...] were convicted of begging and receiving money, and committed to prison as [...] "idle and disorderly persons". The Fifth became [...] "a polysemous occasion, replete with polyvalent cross-referencing, meaning all things to all men". [...] Lower class rioting continued, with reports in Lewes of annual rioting, intimidation of [...] "respectable householders" [...] and the rolling through the streets of lit tar barrels. [...] In Guildford, gangs of revellers who called themselves [...] "guys" [...] terrorised the local population; proceedings were concerned more with the settling of old arguments and general mayhem, than any historical reminiscences. [...] Similar problems arose in Exeter, originally the scene of more traditional celebrations. [...] In 1831 an effigy was burnt of the new Bishop of Exeter Henry Phillpotts, a High Church Anglican and High Tory who opposed Parliamentary reform, and who was also suspected of being involved in [...] "creeping popery". [...] A local ban on fireworks in 1843 was largely ignored, and attempts by the authorities to suppress the celebrations resulted in violent protests and several injured constables.|$|E
