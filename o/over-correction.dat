40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of transformed visual feedback on movement control in Huntington’s disease (HD). Patients {{in the early stages}} of HD and controls performed aiming movements towards peripheral targets on a digitizing tablet using an indirect visual control of movement through a monitor and emphasizing precision. In a baseline condition, HD patients were slower but showed few precision problems in aiming. When visual feedback was inverted in both vertical and horizontal axes, patients showed problems in initial and terminal phases of movement where feedback is most critical. When visual feedback was inverted along a single axis as in a mirror-inversion, HD patients showed large deviations and <b>over-corrections</b> before adaptation. Adaptation was similar in both groups. These results suggest that HD impairs on-line error correction in novel movements...|$|R
40|$|Patient motion during PET scans {{introduces}} {{errors in}} the attenuation correction and image blurring leading to false changes in regional radioactivity concentrations. However, the potential effect that motion has on simulation-based scatter correction is not fully appreciated. Specifically for tracers with high uptake {{close to the edge}} of head (e. g. scalp and nose) as observed with [11 C]Verapamil, mismatches between transmission and emission data can lead to significant quantification errors and image artefacts due to over scatter correction. These errors are linked with unusually high values in the scatter scaling factors (SSF) returned during the single scatter simulation process implemented in the HRRT image reconstruction. Reconstruction of µ-map with TXTV (an alternative µ-map reconstruction using non-linear filtering rather than brain segmentation and scatter correction of the transmission data) was found to improve the scatter simulation results for [11 C]Verapamil and [18 F]FDG. The errors from patient motion were characterised and quantified through simulations by applying realistic transformations to the attenuation map (µ-map). This generated inconsistencies between the emission and transmission data, and introduced large <b>over-corrections</b> of scatter similar to some cases observed with [11 C]Verapamil. Automated Image Registration (AIR) based motion correction was also implemented, and found to remove the artifact and recover quantification in dynamic studies after aligning all the PET images to a common reference space...|$|R

Lipid phenotypes were simulated in the Framingham Heart Study using several measured variables including causal genes (based on a 500 k SNP panel), smoking, dietary intake, and medication usage. We report a sensitivity analysis of how medication use (which artificially alters lipid values) affects association inferences. Associations were performed for LDL-c under seven different correction schemes: 1) ignore medication use entirely (no correction) and adjust for covariates; 2) delete medicated subjects then adjust for covariates; 3) include medication use (Yes/No) as a covariate during covariate adjustments; 4) correct raw values using clinical trials information then adjust for covariates; 5) correct raw values using the actual simulation protocol ("truth") then adjust for covariates; and 6 - 7) <b>over-corrections</b> (add arbitrary values) then adjust for covariates. Results indicate that failure to properly correct for medication usage can profoundly affect the heritability, and hence the association results.

40|$|Magnetic {{anisotropy}} and the elongation/inclination (E-I) {{approaches have}} been increasingly employed as two important means for detecting and correcting the paleomagnetic inclination shallowing in sedimentary rocks that was first recognized sixty years ago. Both approaches {{are based on}} certain assumptions, and thus have advantages and intrinsic limitations in investigating shallow inclinations in sedimentary rocks. The E-I approach {{is relatively easy to}} use, but it needs a large dataset to adequately sample paleomagnetic directions due to paleosecular variation of the geomagnetic field. Also, slow sediment accumulation rates and local tectonics could lead to under- or <b>over-corrections</b> using the E-I approach. For the magnetic anisotropy technique, labor-intensive, sophisticated laboratory rock magnetic experiments are required in order to accurately determine both bulk magnetic anisotropy of remanence-carrying grains and magnetic anisotropy of an individual particle, i. e., a factor, of samples. Our review shows that, despite the intensive laboratory work necessary for applying anisotropy-based inclination corrections, it is worth investing the effort. In addition, the joint use of magnetic susceptibility and remanence anisotropy measurements as well as detailed rock magnetic measurements for determining the particle anisotropy a factor have the advantage of retrieving direct evidence of inclination shallowing and correcting for it with high confidence. We caution against use of either of the two approaches without full appreciation of the underlying assumptions and intrinsic limitations of each technique. The use and comparison of both techniques could provide the most robust inclination shallowing correction for sedimentary rocks...|$|R

40|$|For streamflow forecasting, rainfall–runoff {{models are}} often {{augmented}} with updating procedures that correct forecasts {{based on the}} latest available streamflow observations of streamflow. A popular approach for updating forecasts is autoregressive (AR) models, which exploit the "memory" in hydrological model simulation errors. AR models may be applied to raw errors directly or to normalised errors. In this study, we demonstrate that AR models applied in either way can sometimes cause <b>over-correction</b> of forecasts. In using an AR model applied to raw errors, the <b>over-correction</b> usually occurs when streamflow is rapidly receding. In applying an AR model to normalised errors, the <b>over-correction</b> usually occurs when streamflow is rapidly rising. In addition, when parameters of a hydrological model and an AR model are estimated jointly, the AR model applied to normalised errors sometimes degrades the stand-alone performance of the base hydrological model. This is not desirable for forecasting applications, as forecasts should rely {{as much as possible}} on the base hydrological model, with updating only used to correct minor errors. To overcome the adverse effects of the conventional AR models, a restricted AR model applied to normalised errors is introduced.

40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} the surgical method {{and extent of}} reoperation in the concomitant strabismus patients with surgical under-correction and <b>over-correction.</b> METHODS: Ninety-six concomitant strabismus patients with surgical under-correction and <b>over-correction</b> were recruited in this study, which included 41 males and 55 females, aged 21. 90 ± 14. 70. All individuals underwent routine eye examinations for strabismus before the surgery. Among the cases with concomitant esotropia, there were <b>over-correction</b> in 23 cases, under-correction in 15 cases. Among the cases with concomitant exotropia, there were <b>over-correction</b> in 28 cases, under-correction in 30 cases. The method of reoperation were based on angle of deviation, the method of original operation and acute visual acuity of patients. RESULTS:In <b>over-correction</b> cases with concomitant esotropia,medial rectus muscle of 9 cases were advanced, the corrective extent was(5. 51 ± 2. 63) △ /mm; 9 cases were performed advance of medial rectus muscle and recession of lateral rectus muscle, the corrective extent was(6. 25 ± 1. 59) △ /mm; 3 cases were performed resection of medial rectus muscle and recession of lateral rectus muscle, the corrective extent was(4. 26 ± 1. 04) △ /mm; only 2 cases were performed recession of lateral rectus muscle, the corrective extent was(4. 21 ± 1. 91) △ /mm.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the outcome after surgery for unilateral superior oblique (SO) palsy in Chinese. METHODS: The medical records of 39 patients that underwent surgery for unilateral SO palsy between January 2003 and December 2012 at Caritas Medical Centre, Hong Kong, were retrospectively reviewed. All surgeries were {{performed by a}} single surgeon. Pre-operative assessments for vertical deviation, cyclo-deviation, and Knapp's classification were obtained to determine the nature and degree of surgical correction. Vertical deviation was measured at 1 wk; 1, 6 mo and on last follow-up day post-operatively. Cyclo-deviation was measured on last follow-up day post-operatively. RESULTS: During the 10 y period, 39 subjects were recruited. The most common etiology was congenital (94. 9 %). Knapp's Type III (66. 7 %) and Type I (12. 8 %) classifications were the most common subtypes. To treat SO palsy, the most common surgical procedures were: isolated inferior oblique (IO) anteriorization (41. 0 %), isolated IO myectomy (10. 3 %), and isolated IO recession (10. 3 %). At 3. 5 +/- 2. 1 y post-operatively, the vertical deviation was significantly reduced (15. 1 +/- 6. 2 PD versus 0. 5 +/- 1. 4 PD, P< 0. 0001) without significant improvement in cyclo-deviation (P= 0. 5). Initial vertical deviation was correlated with cyclo-torsion (r= 0. 4, P= 0. 007).

40|$|The {{iterative}} refinement method (IRM) {{has been}} very successfully applied in many different fields for examples the modern quantum chemical calculation and CT image reconstruction. It is proved that the refinement method can create an exact inverse from an approximate inverse with a few iterations. The IRM {{has been used in}} CT image reconstruction to lower the radiation dose. The IRM utilize the errors between the original measured data and the recalculated data to correct the reconstructed images. However if it is not smooth inside the object, there often is an <b>over-correction</b> along the boundary of the organs in the reconstructed images. The <b>over-correction</b> increase the noises especially on the edges inside the image. One solution to reduce the above mentioned noises is using some kind of filters. Filtering the noise before/after/between the image reconstruction processing. However filtering the noises also means reduce the resolution of the reconstructed images. The filtered image is often applied to the image automation for examples image segmentation or image registration but diagnosis. For diagnosis, doctor would prefer the original images without filtering process. In the time these authors of this manuscript did the work of interior image reconstruction with local inverse method, they noticed that the local inverse method does not only reduced the truncation artifacts but also reduced the artifacts and noise introduced from filtered back-projection method without truncation. This discovery lead them to develop the sub-regional iterative refinement (SIRM) image reconstruction method. The SIRM did good job to reduce the artifacts and noises in the reconstructed images.
