40|$|University of Minho is {{a partner}} of the INSYSME {{research}} project (Innovative Systems <b>for</b> earthquake resistant <b>masonry</b> enclosures in RC buildings), funded by the European Commission. The main aims of this project are to study new systems <b>for</b> <b>masonry</b> infill walls, which combine simplicity with low cost, and to propose recommendations and calculation procedures for their design to seismic actions, filling an existing gap in current regulations. At University of Minho a new construction system <b>for</b> <b>masonry</b> enclosures was developed, being composed of a new commercial unit and vertical steel reinforcement placed in ceramic brick frogs, connected to top and bottom beams. In this paper, the experimental work developed at the University of Minho for validation of the solution proposed <b>for</b> <b>masonry</b> infills is presented and discussed. The experimental validation process of the solution <b>for</b> the <b>masonry</b> enclosure walls was based on in-plane and out-of-plane static cyclic tests. The tests were carried in four specimens built at reduced scale (1 : 1. 5). In order to assess the in-plane behaviour, two specimens have been tested. The first test was done, in a specimen with masonry infill, until maximum drift. In the second test, only reinforcement concrete frame was tested, to access the contribution of <b>masonry</b> infill. <b>For</b> out-of-plane direction two specimens were tested one without reinforcement, and other with reinforcement. The out-of-plane test was carried using an airbag system. In this case only positive direction was considered.

40|$|The {{assessment}} procedures <b>for</b> <b>masonry</b> structures require some mechanical parameter {{to be defined}} <b>for</b> <b>masonry,</b> at least the compressive strength. Several theoretical approaches, based {{on the characteristics of}} the constituents, i. e. bricks and mortar, have been developed but their application to existing masonry turns out to be rather difficult. Therefore, experimental approaches give a fundamental contribution to the identification of the mechanical parameters provided that proper calibration allows a reliable estimation of the experimental error. In this paper, the calibration of compressive tests on large diameter cylinders, drilled from brickwork and loaded on the lateral surfaces, is discussed on the bases of both experimental and theoretical issues. This technique is shown to reproduce the brickwork collapse mechanism, giving reliable estimates of the masonry compressive strengt...|$|R

30|$|Based on the {{positive}} experience gained {{in recent years in}} developing the basis for the displacement-based seismic design of concrete structures, it appears that the most feasible approach to enhance the rationality for the design of masonry structures is to apply the same fundamentals in the analysis of masonry structures. A more consistent representation of the material resistance {{as well as of the}} (seismic) loads leads to more economical (or at least more reliable) designs in general, and especially <b>for</b> <b>masonry</b> structures where the safety margin, i.e. safety factor at present, is mostly based on experience rather than on quantified engineering modelling. Obviously, the first step towards the development of such an approach <b>for</b> <b>masonry</b> structures is to investigate the limits of the deformation capacity of masonry structures.|$|R

Although {{it is necessary to}} study the whole masonry behaviour, the scope of this paper refers to the mortar only, without taking into account the blocks. As with other masonry units, compressive strength is a basic measure of quality <b>for</b> <b>masonry</b> mortars. However, there is a great variety of methodology for determining their parameters and properties, such as different samples geometry, the way strains are measured and also the platen restraint effect adopted. The present paper outlines certain experimental devices used to determine compressive strength of earth mortars and tries to show their influence on the properties determined. Proposals for the future development of testing earth mortars are outlined. Keywords...|$|R

40|$|Non-destructive {{monitoring}} of the infrastructure is becoming an increasingly important issue <b>for</b> asset management. <b>Masonry</b> arch bridges represent around 40 % of the European bridge stock, many of them over 100 years old and in increasing need for maintenance. Condition assessment of masonry arch bridges relies largely on visual observation, although a range of non-destructive techniques (NDT) are available for monitoring their condition and performance. Identifying deterioration {{and changes in the}} structure’s behaviour under working loads would be of great help to prevent critical damage. While most NDT techniques require direct access to the structure and can be labour-intensive, Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique offers a low-cost optical solution that allows surface displacement, stress and strain distribution to be recorded without any contact with the structure. Digital Image Correlation is increasingly widely used for civil infrastructure, but its use <b>for</b> <b>masonry</b> arch bridges is currently rather limited. The paper demonstrates the use of Digital Image Correlation technique under laboratory conditions <b>for</b> small-scale <b>masonry</b> specimens and under field conditions <b>for</b> a <b>masonry</b> arch railway bridge under traffic loading...|$|R
