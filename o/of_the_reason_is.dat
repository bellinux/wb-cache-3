25|$|Although Hill is {{not well}} known in the United States, he has become a celebrity in China as chief envoy in talks on North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that during {{negotiations}} Hill speaks every morning and evening to the media and has an easygoing manner, while his North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye Gwan, gives only occasional media access.|$|E
25|$|If the MBS was not {{underwritten by}} the {{original}} real estate and the issuer's guarantee, the rating of the bonds would be much lower. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> the expected adverse selection against borrowers with improving credit (from MBSs pooled by initial credit quality) who would {{have an incentive to}} refinance (ultimately joining an MBS pool with a higher credit rating).|$|E
25|$|The FutureGen Alliance wrote {{a letter}} to the Department of Energy’s Under Secretary C.H. “Bud” Albright Jr. stating that overall {{inflation}} and the rising cost of raw materials and engineering services are driving costs up on energy projects around the world. According to James L. Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, the market for steel, concrete and power plant components has “just gone through the roof globally”, and much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> the construction of hundreds of new conventional coal plants.|$|E

25|$|Counties {{have since}} {{gone out of}} use in Australia, and are rarely used or even known {{by most of the}} {{population}} today. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that counties are based on the size of land, rather than population, so in a large country where most of the population live in cities on the coast while the countryside has a very low population density, they have little relevance. The counties which contain the capital cities have millions of people, while those in remote areas have a very small population. The County of Adelaide, for instance, has a larger population than all the other counties in South Australia combined. Another reason {{is that many of the}} counties' borders follow rivers, having been proclaimed before settlements developed, which means that towns which typically grow up on rivers often find themselves in more than one county. Wangaratta, for instance, is located at the junction of the Ovens and King rivers, and is thus in three counties; Moira, Delatite and Bogong.|$|E
25|$|The {{market has}} also had famous seller, such as Ignacio Contreras, better known as “El Chacharitas,” who was noted among {{collectors}} as able to obtain all kinds of valuable objects at elevated prices. However, those {{who knew how to}} bargain could obtain significant discounts. El Chacharitas states that the sale of antiques was a very good business in the past but less so now. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> the degradation of the neighborhood, and the invasion of those selling mass-produced, unlicensed and counterfeit merchandise. The antiques market also has been hurt by Mexico City mayor Marcelos Ebrard’s decision to close roads in and around the historic center as well as Paseo de la Reforma to vehicular traffic on Sundays, the day this market operates. For some vendors, business is down by as much as sixty percent, as many upper class residents will not use public transportation to get to this market.|$|E

2500|$|The church {{architecture}} of Cornwall and Devon typically {{differs from that}} of the rest of southern England: most medieval churches in the larger parishes were rebuilt in the later medieval period with one or two aisles and a western tower, the aisles being the same width as the nave and the piers of the arcades being of one of a few standard types. Wagon roofs often survive in these churches. The typical tower is of three stages, often with buttresses set back from the angles. Only a few Cornish church towers are beautiful or striking, the majority are plain and dull. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> the shortage of good building stone in the county. The arcades of those churches with aisles generally have piers of one of three different types: Type A [...] "consists of four attached shafts in the main axes and four hollows in the diagonals"; Type B which seems to have been in use earlier has [...] "square piers with four attached demi-shafts"; or octagonal piers. Type A is very common in both Devon and Cornwall.|$|E
2500|$|Overall, Jakala said [...] "the {{series has}} grown on [...] over time. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that Hidaka isn't just writing about dry {{political}} {{systems in the}} abstract; he humanizes concepts by crafting various characters that we follow through the tumultuous events depicted in this book." [...] Both Jakala and McElhatton highlighted and praised the fact that although Sakuragi is depicted as [...] "handsome, suave, and poised" [...] (Jakala), [...] "decisive, smart, and charismatic" [...] (McElhatton), [...] "Yoshiki remembers to keep his character human; he's got his flaws, and his doubts that he hides from the public. In the end, it just makes him all the more likable" [...] (McElhatton). In Jakala's opinion, [...] "One of the strongest things about this series is Sakuragi's character" [...] because [...] "Hidaka hasn't gone too far in making Sakuragi unbelievably perfect". In opposition, Jason Thompson, writing for ANN, considered the depiction of [...] "a badass Japanese politician, who stands up to America, China and North Korea, more comedic than believable." ...|$|E

5000|$|However, {{documentary}} evidence remains scarce; as some suggest, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> that scholars in Russia working on archival material {{have tended to}} treat issues of sexuality with some caution and homosexuality remains a taboo subject for Russian readers and students.|$|R
