5|$|In early {{versions}} of Perl, database interfaces {{were created by}} relinking the interpreter with a client-side database library.

5|$|Once {{the church}} and rectory had been completed, the workers began to {{envision}} a plaza. The area that was to become the oval was still occupied by the mansion {{that was on the}} Mt. St. Peter grounds. With the permission of the Chancery Office of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, the mansion was demolished and <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fixtures were removed by the church prior to the demolition.|$|E
5|$|Amy awakens to {{find herself}} {{strapped}} to an examining table, near to where Ambrose's husband Mo is also ensnared. Mo explains that the Silurians intended to vivisect her, as they have vivisected himâ€” awake. The Doctor and Nasreen arrive underground in the TARDIS; the Doctor explains about the Silurians and says that he expects to encounter <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creatures. The show ends on a cliffhanger as the Doctor and Nasreen behold an immense Silurian civilisation in the caverns below the earth.|$|E
5|$|For {{almost a}} century <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> texts were published. In 1875, the {{director}} of the Chilean National Museum of Natural History in Santiago, Rudolf Philippi, published the Santiago Staff, and Carroll (1892) published part of the Oar. Most texts remained beyond the reach of would-be decipherers until 1958, when Thomas Barthel published line drawings of almost all the known corpus in his Grundlagen zur Entzifferung der Osterinselschrift ("Bases for the Decipherment of the Easter Island script") which remains the fundamental reference to rongorongo. He transcribed texts A through X, over 99% of the corpus; the CEIPP estimates that it is 97% accurate. Barthel's line drawings were not produced free-hand but copied from rubbings, which helped ensure their faithfulness to the originals.|$|E
50|$|The Soviet {{military}} sent {{a number}} of interceptor aircraft specifications to the design bureaus for proposals. These proposals produced families of similar designs from each bureau, including prototypes, armed and reconnaissance variants. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> these projects were known in the west, and many were never discovered at all, as <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> each were produced, and they were often recycled into later variants.|$|R

5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries Dorchester {{suffered}} several serious fires: in 1613, {{caused by}} a tallow chandler's cauldron getting too hot and setting alight; in 1622, started by a maltster; in 1725, begun in a brewhouse; and in 1775, {{caused by a}} soap boiler. The 1613 fire was the most devastating, resulting {{in the destruction of}} 300 houses and two churches (All Saints and Holy Trinity). <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town's early buildings have survived to the present day, including Judge Jeffreys' lodgings and a Tudor almshouse. Among the replacement Georgian buildings are many, such as the Shire Hall, which are built in Portland stone. The Town Hall was erected in 1791 and had a marketplace underneath.|$|E
5|$|The E-4 variant {{was fitted}} with {{external}} bomb racks also {{and the empty}} bomb bay space was filled with an 835L (221US gal) tank for aviation fuel and a further 115L (30US gal) oil tank. This increased the loaded weight but increased range to 1,800km (1,130mi). The modifications allowed the He 111 to perform both long- and short-range missions. The E-4's eight internal vertically aligned bomb racks could each carry a 250kg (550lb) bomb. The last E Variant, the He 111E-5, was powered by the Jumo 211A-3, and retained the 835L (221US gal) fuel tank {{on the port side}} of the bomb bay. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> E-4 and E-5 were built.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} these Native Americans were, in deeds and correspondence, {{known as the}} Sepasco Indians, a name {{specific}} to Native Americans in the Sepasco area (modern-day Rhinebeck). The word Sepasco probably originated from the tribe's word for little river or stream, sepuus, which {{is believed to have}} referred to the Landsman Kill, a stream parallel to NY308. After the American Civil War, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sepasco were left; the last Sepasco died in a hut near Welch's Cave and Lake Sepasco and was reported in the local newspaper in 1867. By 1685, a trail known as the Sepasco Trail was formed by them and was routed from the Hudson River, eastward through the present-day Village of Rhinebeck, ending at Lake Sepasco. The trail from the Village of Rhinebeck to Lake Sepasco follows roughly modern-day Route308, in some areas slightly to the south, where the highway's side roads are curved in a pattern {{similar to that of the}} Sepasco Trail. It is possible that the trail as a whole existed as a spur of an ancient path that stretched from Rhinebeck to Cornwall, Connecticut.|$|E

5|$|At La Brea, predatory {{birds and}} mammals were {{attracted}} to dead or dying herbivores that had become mired, and then these predators became trapped themselves. Herbivore entrapment was estimated to have occurred once every fifty years, and for every instance of herbivore remains found in the pits there were an estimated ten carnivores. C.d.guildayi {{is the most common}} carnivoran found at LaBrea, followed by Smilodon. Remains of dire wolves outnumber remains of gray wolves in the tar pits by a ratio of five to one. During the Last Glacial Maximum, coastal California, with a climate slightly cooler and wetter than today, is thought to have been a refuge, and a comparison of the frequency of dire wolves and other predator remains at LaBrea to other parts of California and North America indicates significantly greater abundances; therefore, the higher dire wolf numbers in the LaBrea region did not reflect the wider area. Assuming that <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carnivores that were feeding became trapped, it is likely that fairly sizeable groups of dire wolves fed together on these occasions.|$|E
5|$|King won the Child's Bowling Cup, {{the premier}} award for bowling in American cricket, {{for the first}} time in 1896, and joined the Philadelphian cricket team's tour of England in 1897. The tour was very ambitious, and was {{arranged}} mainly for educational purposes: few of those on the American side expected to win many matches. Previous tours had tended to involve amateur English sides with a low level of competition. In 1897, the tour started on June 7 at Oxford, ending in late July at The Oval almost 2 months later. The schedule included fifteen matches against all of the top county cricket teams, the Oxford and Cambridge University teams, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and two other sides, though <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> counties thought it worthwhile to put their best elevens onto the field.|$|E
5|$|The raids {{continued}} periodically {{for almost}} three decades, until in 1749 when Spanish settlers and the Lipan Apache peoples made peace. But the treaty angered the enemies of the Apache, and resulted in raids on Spanish settlements by the Comanche, Tonkawa, and Hasinai tribes. Fear of Indian attacks and the remoteness of the area {{from the rest of}} the Viceroyalty discouraged settlers from moving to Texas. It remained one of the least-populated by immigrants provinces. The threat of attacks did not decrease until 1785, when Spain and the Comanche peoples made a peace agreement. The Comanche tribe later assisted in defeating the Lipan Apache and Karankawa tribes, who had continued to cause difficulties for settlers. An increase in the number of missions in the province allowed for a peaceful Indian reductions of other tribes, and by the end of the 18th century, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nomadic hunting and gathering tribes in the area had not been converted.|$|E

5|$|During the series' fifty-year history <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{films have}} {{remained}} substantially true to their source material; Dr. No has many similarities {{to the novel}} and follows its basic plot, {{but there are a}} few notable omissions. Major elements from the novel that are missing from the film include Bond's fight with a giant squid, and the escape from Dr. No's complex using the dragon-disguised swamp buggy. Elements of the novel that were significantly changed for the film include the use of a (non-venomous) tarantula spider instead of a centipede; Dr. No's secret complex being disguised as a bauxite mine instead of a guano quarry; Dr. No's plot to disrupt NASA space launches from Cape Canaveral using a radio beam instead of disrupting US missile testing on Turks Island; the method of Dr. No's death by boiling in overheating reactor coolant rather than a burial under a chute of guano, and the introduction of SPECTRE, an organisation absent from the book. Components absent from the novel but added to the film include the introduction of the Bond character in a gambling casino, the introduction of Bond's semi-regular girlfriend Sylvia Trench, a fight scene with an enemy chauffeur, a fight scene to introduce Quarrel, the seduction of Miss Taro, Bond's recurring CIA ally Felix Leiter, Dr. No's partner in crime Professor Dent and Bond's controversial cold-blooded killing of this character.|$|E
