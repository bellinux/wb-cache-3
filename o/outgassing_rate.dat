40|$|The <b>outgassing</b> <b>rates</b> of two graphite-epoxy laminates, American Cyanamide 985 B- 626 and HST- 7 B- 112, were {{obtained}} using a gravimetric method. The rates {{as a function}} of time and temperature were derived from the measurements of their mass losses at temperatures varying from 25 to 150 C and for a time span of up to 400 hours in a vacuum. The data from those measurements were reduced to obtain the outgassing activation energies, the mass losses per unit mass or area, and the corresponding <b>outgassing</b> <b>rates.</b> The rates are expressed in closed-form equations and are directly usable for medling computations. The procedures to obtain these parameters are shown and may be used for the evaluation of other materials. The results of the tests show that the activation energies of the two materials are: 4630 cal/mole for the 985 B- 626 materials and 4791 cal/mole for the HST- 7 B- 112 sample no. 10 Graphite Exoxy. The <b>outgassing</b> <b>rates</b> of these materials are in the 10 E- 5 g/sq cm/hr range and they decay according to a power of time of 0. 60 at 25 C, indicating that the outgassing process is mainly a diffusion at that temperature.

In this model the <b>outgassing</b> <b>rate</b> is described as a function of time using the conservation of mass equation for gas molecules in the vacuum system. In order to solve this equation, it is essential to introduce an auxiliary equation which enables to determine the surface covarage {{as a function of the}} heat of absorption. when this auxiliary function is expressed with the variation of heat of adsorption in the Temkin isotherm and the Freundlich isotherm, the solution for the <b>outgassing</b> <b>rate</b> gives a power law Q = const.

40|$|Ultra low {{outgassing}} {{rates would}} be highly advantageous in accelerators and storage rings, such as the Next Linear Collider (NLC), where an <b>outgassing</b> <b>rate</b> of < 10 - 12 Torr liter/sec/cm 2 could {{eliminate the need for}} costly distributed pumping. Measuring such low outgassing rates at room temperature has many difficulties. However, by inspection of Fick's law, {{it can be seen that}} thermal desorption is proportional to <b>outgassing</b> <b>rate.</b> It is commonly observed that the outgas rate doubles approximately every 15 ºC for temperatures under 100 ºC. By measuring <b>outgassing</b> <b>rate</b> versus temperature and time and extrapolating back to room temperature we can measure outgassing rates that would otherwise be difficult to make. To produce a reliable measurement also requires the total surface area under study to be approximately an order of magnitude greater than the area of the measurement chamber walls. To accomplish this, 27 plates of 5083 aluminum were placed in the measurement chamber. This technique will be the basis for future investigation of outgassing rates of other sample plates fabricated with different machining and cleaning techniques. ...|$|E

We study the temporal and spatial distribution of this cavity and its boundary and conclude that the cavity properties depend on the long-term trend of the <b>outgassing</b> <b>rate,</b> but do not respond to transient events at the spacecraft location, such as outbursts or high neutral densities. Using an empirical model of the <b>outgassing</b> <b>rate,</b> we find a functional relationship between the <b>outgassing</b> <b>rate</b> and the distance of the cavity to the nucleus. There is also no indication that this unexpectedly large distance is related to unusual solar wind conditions.

Lake Ainsworth was a source of CO 2 to the atmosphere throughout the study period with <b>outgassing</b> <b>rates</b> ranging from 10. 6 to 152. 3 mmol m 2 day− 1. Annual groundwater fluxes were determined using a radon mass balance equated to about 55 ± 50 % of the total volume of water input (via direct precipitation and groundwater) into the lake.
