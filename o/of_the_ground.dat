5|$|After Bradford City won the Division Two {{championship}} in 1907–08, the club hurried through a reconstruction programme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> {{to prepare for}} the club's first season in Division One. Football architect Archibald Leitch was commissioned to design new terracing in the paddock—a standing area in front of the 5,300-seater main stand which was built in 1908—and build a Spion Kop at the north side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and an 8,000-capacity stand at the Midland Road end opposite the main stand. Further work was performed to lower the railings, erect barriers, move the pitch and add extra turnstiles. The changing rooms were also moved, with a tunnel leading from the rooms underneath the Kop along the main stand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The total project cost £9,958, and raised the capacity to 40,000. The work was not completed until midway through the 1908–09 season. The first match after work was finished took place on Christmas Day 1908, when 36,000fans saw City host Bristol City. The improvements allowed Bradford City to set their record attendance of 39,146 on 11 March 1911 against Burnley during the club's FA Cup winning run. It is the longest surviving attendance record at any league ground in the country.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{both ends}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> {{featured}} a large arc behind the goals. This was {{created as a}} requirement for the 1966 World Cup because the crowd {{had to be a}} required distance from the goals.|$|E

5|$|Renovation of Kenilworth Road was {{neglected}} for {{the next}} two decades—financial difficulties and the club's ambitions to build a new ground meant that regeneration was unaffordable, and would also prove unnecessary should relocation occur. However, following the rejection of several potential sites for a new ground, the club finally turned their attentions back to the maintenance of Kenilworth Road. The first real modernisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> came in 1973, with the first addition of seats at the stadium since the construction of the new Main Stand in 1922. The Bobbers Stand became all-seated, while the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> remained terracing. The new-look stand could only hold 1,539 seats, and as a result the capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> dropped to 22,601.|$|E

The stadium gives an illusion that supporters in the upper tier on one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> are unable to see supporters in the upper tier opposite. As part of a deal with Sony, the stadium {{was the first in}} the world to incorporate HDTV streaming. In the north-west and south-east corners of the stadium are two giant screens suspended from the roof.|$|E

5|$|Visiting team fans {{sat in the}} TL Dallas Stand from 1995 to 2008, {{but have}} also been given other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> for larger matches. In March 2008, the club {{announced}} that the TL Dallas Stand would be made available for home fans for the 2008–09 season. The decision came after an overwhelmingly positive text message poll from the club's supporters to use the Bradford End <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Visiting team fans have been accommodated in the end blocks of the East Stand {{since the start of}} the 2008–09 season.

5|$|A {{recovered}} propeller {{showed that}} the engine had been running at near-cruising speed {{at the time of}} the impact. Additionally, the condition of the wheels proved that the undercarriage was still retracted, suggesting controlled flight into terrain rather than an attempted emergency landing. During the final portion of Star Dust flight, heavy clouds would have blocked visibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> It has therefore been suggested that, in the absence of visual sightings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> due to the clouds, a large navigational error could have been made as the aircraft flew through the jet stream—a phenomenon not well understood in 1947, in which high-altitude winds can blow at high speed in directions different from those of winds observed at ground level. If the airliner, which had to cross the Andes mountain range at , had entered the jet-stream zone—which in this area normally blows from the west and south-west, resulting in the aircraft encountering a headwind—this would have significantly decreased the aircraft's ground speed.|$|E

The Oak Road End was filled with seats, while the Bobbers Stand had its seats ripped out to be replaced with executive boxes. The Main Stand's enclosure received seats, and work also began on converting the Kenilworth Stand, which had a roof added at this time. The stand would also receive seats in stages over the coming years.|$|E

5|$|According {{to local}} geologists, the exact {{source of the}} spring remains unknown, but it is {{believed}} that its origin may be southwest of its actual location, possibly at Bukit Timah.
