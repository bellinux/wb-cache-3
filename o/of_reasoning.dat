5|$|Each {{attempt to}} answer the mind–body problem {{encounters}} substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion. These philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers {{in the tradition of}} linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory. They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts. This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy <b>of</b> <b>reasoning.</b>|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into three parts: concealment, advertisement, and disguise. Part 1, concealment, covers the methods of camouflage, which are colour resemblance, countershading, {{disruptive}} coloration, and shadow elimination. The effectiveness of these, arguments for and against them, and experimental evidence, are described. Part 2, advertisement, covers the methods of becoming conspicuous, especially for warning displays in aposematic animals. Examples are chosen from mammals, insects, reptiles and marine animals, and empirical evidence from feeding experiments with toads is presented. Part 3, disguise, covers methods of mimicry that provide camouflage, as when animals resemble leaves or twigs, and markings and displays that help to deflect attack or to deceive predators with deimatic displays. Both Batesian mimicry and Müllerian mimicry are treated as adaptive resemblance, much like camouflage, while a chapter is devoted to the mimicry and behaviour of the cuckoo. The concluding chapter admits that the book's force is cumulative, consisting of many small steps <b>of</b> <b>reasoning,</b> and being a wartime book, compares animal to military camouflage.|$|E

5|$|Whimpress tabled various {{hypotheses}} for Crockett's actions. At the time, Crockett was 37 {{years old}} {{and was ready to}} emerge from the shadow of Phillips, the eminent Australian umpire of the time. When Crockett called Marsh, it was his 29th match as a first-class umpire and the no-balling was seen in some quarters as a signal that he felt ready to officiate in Test matches. A cynical view of Crockett's calls held that if throwing was to be eradicated then the umpire was going to choose a soft target. This theory ruled out the calling of a fellow Victorian, his state of origin. The same line <b>of</b> <b>reasoning</b> concluded that a New South Welshman would be called, and likely not a high-profile Test player like Noble or Jack Saunders. Those who adhered to this hypothesis believed that it would be easier for Crockett to target someone who had a previous stigma of throwing and that Marsh—an aborigine who led the bowling averages with 21 wickets at 17.38—was an ideal target.|$|E
5|$|Events in {{the world}} {{appeared}} to play into the reformers' hands. Poland's neighbors were too occupied with wars to intervene forcibly in Poland, with Russia and Austria engaged in hostilities with the Ottoman Empire (the Russo-Turkish War and the Austro-Turkish War); the Russians also found themselves fighting Sweden (the Russo-Swedish War). At first, King Poniatowski and some reformers hoped to gain Russian support for the reforms; they attempted to draw Poland into the Austro-Russian alliance, seeing a war with the Ottomans {{as an opportunity to}} strengthen the Commonwealth. Due to internal Russian politics, this plan was not implemented. Spurned by Russia, Poland turned to another potential ally, the Triple Alliance, represented on the Polish diplomatic scene primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia. This line <b>of</b> <b>reasoning</b> gained support from Polish politicians such as Ignacy Potocki and Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski. With the new Polish-Prussian alliance seeming to provide security against Russian intervention, King Poniatowski drew closer to leaders of the reform-minded Patriotic Party. This alliance was also helped as the 1790 elections were more supportive of the royal faction then Potocki's; and the conservative faction gained enough new seats to threaten the reformers if they were to stay divided. With the mediation of Scipione Piattoli, Potocki and Poniatowski begun to reach a consensus on a more constitutional monarchy approach, and started to draft a constitutional document.|$|E

40|$|Narrative {{reasoning}} is an inductive cognitive strategy used to understand patients’ experiences with illness within the biosocial {{context of their}} lives. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the meaning of the patient’s illness experience to physical therapist students and propose a theory <b>of</b> narrative <b>reasoning</b> development in these novice clinicians. The data collected from twenty-one first year physical therapy students consisted of narratives written during their clinical internships describing a patient’s experience with illness and post-internship interviews telling the patient’s story. Data were analyzed in a process of constant comparison, evolving codes, and researcher memoing using both grounded theory and narrative analyses. Themes that emerged in open coding and core categories were validated in selective coding. In the final stage of theoretical coding, relationships between the saturated core categories and relevance to current theory were established. The final result was a model of the development <b>of</b> narrative <b>reasoning,</b> illustrating contributions to current theory. The main themes that emerged from the data related to the novice therapist’s development <b>of</b> narrative <b>reasoning</b> were in four areas: perspective, clinical narrative focus, reflective skills, and therapeutic alliance. The theoretical model advanced by this study is a recursive, spiraling developmental process <b>of</b> narrative <b>reasoning</b> through phases that are influenced by drivers and/or barriers. The process includes co-construction <b>of</b> narrative <b>reasoning</b> through encounters with patients, families, clinical instructors and other team members. Establishing a therapeutic alliance is a pivotal point in the development <b>of</b> narrative <b>reasoning</b> and is based on an empathic perspective and strengthened through a reflective approach. In conclusion, this study contributes to the understanding of the development <b>of</b> narrative <b>reasoning.</b> This model <b>of</b> narrative <b>reasoning</b> in student physical therapists has implications for educational interventions aimed at providing learning experiences that parallel the development <b>of</b> narrative <b>reasoning...</b>|$|R
