40|$|A new {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) micro X-ray fluorescence (mu XRF) methodology {{based on}} a novel 2 D energy dispersive CCD detector has been developed and evaluated at the P 06 beamline of the Petra-III storage ring (DESY) in Hamburg, Germany.

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} a {{magnetic}} field {{on the development of}} texture and microstructure in cold-rolled (80 %) commercially pure zirconium (Zr 701) was investigated. The specifically <b>oriented</b> <b>sheet</b> specimens were annealed at 550 °C for 15, 30 and 45 min and at 700 °C for 60, 90 and 180 min in a magnetic field of 19 T and 17 T, respectively. X-ray diffraction and electron backscatter diffraction measurements were used to characterize the crystallographic texture and the grain microstructure. The results revealed that the magnetic annealing promotes grain growth in the investigated material. This becomes apparent from the faster development of specific "grain growth" texture components and the bigger mean grain size after magnetic annealing. Magnetic annealing at 700 °C resulted in asymmetry of the two major texture components that constantly increased with annealing time. This effect is attributed to a magnetic driving force for grain growth arising from the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility of zirconium...|$|E

Initial clay flocculation {{is crucial in}} the design and {{for the development of a}} new methodology of gas exploitation. Microstructural engineering of clay aggregates using covalent cations and Keggin macromolecules have been monitored using the new state of the art Transmission X-ray Microscope (TXM) with 60 nm tomography resolution installed in a Taiwanese synchrotron. The 3 -D reconstructions from TXM images show complex aggregation structures in montmorillonite aqueous suspensions after treatment with Na+, Ca 2 + and Al 13 Keggin macromolecules. Na-montmorillonite displays elongated, parallel, well-orientated and closed-void cellular networks, 0. 5 – 3 µm in diameter. After treatment by covalent cations, the coagulated structure displays much smaller, randomly orientated and openly connected cells, 300 – 600 nm in diameter. The average distances measured between montmorillonite sheets was around 450 nm, which is less than half of the cell dimension measured in Na-montmorillonite.

40|$|The Gulf of California, {{which forms}} {{part of the}} Pacific–North American plate boundary, is an ideal place to {{investigate}} upper mantle dynamics in a continental rifting area. With 19 seismic stations located around the gulf, the NARS-Baja experiment (2002 – 2008) was designed to image its crustal and mantle structure. Here we present results of a tomographic inversion of Love and Rayleigh interstation phase velocity measurements for a radially anisotropic shear velocity model of the Gulf of California. This study confirms the overall low shear-wave velocities in the upper 200 km of the mantle found in other Rayleigh wave studies, {{and the presence of}} a positive shear-wave velocity anomaly at depths of roughly 80 – 160 km beneath the central gulf (Zhang et al., 2009). In addition, we find that the horizontal shear velocity (VSH) is generally higher than the vertical shear velocity (VSV). For the northern gulf, however, there is strong indication for VSV > VSH in the 40 – 60 km depth range. This region also has anomalously low shear-wave velocities down to 100 km depth. Combining these observations, we suggest that the low velocity anomaly and the negative radial anisotropy (VSH < VSV) beneath the northern gulf are related to vertical flow of low velocity material in an area of a slab window, either by the vertical alignment of olivine crystals or by a fabric of vertically <b>oriented</b> <b>sheets</b> of melt. The high-velocity anomaly beneath the central gulf is interpreted as a remnant slab fragment which inhibits vertical flow from the deeper mantle. Our tomographic results indicate that the formation of the Gulf of California cannot be explained by simple models of crustal extension or dynamic upwelling. Instead, its structure and geodynamics are caused by the cessation of subduction by stalled microplates in the central and southern gulf and the presence of a slab window in the north...|$|R

40|$|Graphene, first {{isolated}} in 2004 {{and the subject}} of the 2010 Nobel Prize in physics, has generated a tremendous amount of research interest in recent years due to its incredible mechanical and electrical properties. However, difficulties in large-scale production and low as-prepared surface area have hindered commercial applications. In this dissertation, a new material is described incorporating the superior electrical properties of graphene edge planes into the high surface area framework of carbon nanotube forests using a scalable and reproducible technology. The objectives of this research were to investigate the growth parameters and mechanisms of a graphene-carbon nanotube hybrid nanomaterial termed “graphenated carbon nanotubes” (g-CNTs), examine the applicability of g-CNT materials for applications in electrochemical capacitors (supercapacitors) and cold-cathode field emission sources, and determine materials characteristics responsible for the superior performance of g-CNTs in these applications. The growth kinetics of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), was studied {{in order to understand the}} fundamental mechanisms governing the PECVD reaction process. Activation energies and diffusivities were determined for key reaction steps and a growth model was developed in response to these findings. Differences in the reaction kinetics between CNTs grown on single-crystal silicon and polysilicon were studied to aid in the incorporation of CNTs into microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. To understand processing-property relationships for g-CNT materials, a Design of Experiments (DOE) analysis was performed for the purpose of determining the importance of various input parameters on the growth of g-CNTs, finding that varying temperature alone allows the resultant material to transition from CNTs to g-CNTs and finally carbon nanosheets (CNSs) : vertically <b>oriented</b> <b>sheets</b> of few-layered graphene. In addition, a phenomenological model was developed for g-CNTs. By studying variations of graphene-CNT hybrid nanomaterials by Raman spectroscopy, a linear trend was discovered between their mean crystallite size and electrochemical capacitance.
