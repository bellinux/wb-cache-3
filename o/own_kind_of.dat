25|$|Tectonic {{plates are}} {{composed}} of oceanic lithosphere and thicker continental lithosphere, each topped by its <b>own</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> crust. Along convergent boundaries, subduction, or one plate moving under another, carries the lower one down into the mantle; the material lost is roughly balanced by the formation of new (oceanic) crust along divergent margins by seafloor spreading. In this way, the total surface of the lithosphere remains the same. This prediction of plate tectonics is {{also referred to as}} the conveyor belt principle. Earlier theories, since disproven, proposed gradual shrinking (contraction) or gradual expansion of the globe.|$|E

Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics. They are among the most ubiquitous models of both natural and human-made structures. They can model many types of relations and process dynamics in physical, biological and social systems. In computer science, they can represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, the flow of computation, etc. In mathematics, they are useful in geometry and certain parts of topology, e.g. knot theory. Algebraic graph theory has close links with group theory. There are also continuous graphs, however for the most part research in graph theory falls within the domain of discrete mathematics.|$|E
25|$|The Coast {{as it was}} called, also invented its <b>own</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> dance hall, {{called a}} Barbary Coast Dance Hall. It was {{different}} than most dance halls in that the only women there were the female employees who were paid to dance with the customers, and received commissions on the drinks that they could encourage their male customers to buy. Lawlessness was so bad in the Barbary Coast district that police did not patrol alone, but chose to walk their beats in pairs and sometimes in groups. There was usually a murder every night and scores of robberies. And even while inside drinking establishments, a customer's property and life were still never safe. Prostitution was so common on the Barbary Coast that it {{was referred to as}} the Paris of America. Drug addicts of the district could even buy cocaine or morphine at an all night Grant Street drugstore for only two or three times the price of a beer. And during the 1890s San Francisco hit its peak alcohol consumption in having over 3000 licensed bars, and another 2000 unlicensed bars.|$|E

According to Coleman regarding Clara's bond with The Doctor inquring if she had feelings for him she stated “She’s totally in love with him, always has been. It’s its <b>own</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> love. He is her hero but she would be very reluctant to tell him that. It’s a doctor-and-companion love, and there’s nothing else like it really.” “They’re kind of freed of their issues and in a wonderful place together. Previously {{she was trying to}} keep him under control yet now the two of them are going ‘Come on, lets jump, lets do it’, egging each other on really, and being more and more reckless,” she teased. Capaldi stated “It’s sort of an utterly platonic bond, which is quite unusual. The problem is the Doctor knows a lot more than he ever says. He knows Clara’s fate. He knows the fate of all his companions before they do.” Ultimately it has been confirmed by both Capaldi and Coleman that the Doctor and Clara's relationship is romantic in nature.|$|E

In February 2008, Whedonesque was cited as a source in a New York Times piece on Steven Brust's Firefly novel, My <b>Own</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Freedom. Later that year, Whedonesque was cited in mainstream media treatment of Dollhouse (especially Whedon's post explaining the new pilot) and Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. The site was taken offline for a day by the attention prompted by the release of Dr. Horrible, resulting in the site's movement from Pair.com, where it had originated, to Mediatemple.net.
