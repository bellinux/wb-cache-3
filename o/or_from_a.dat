5|$|Mid-19th century Navajo rugs {{often used}} a three-ply yarn called Saxony, {{which refers to}} high-quality, {{naturally}} dyed, silky yarns. Red tones in Navajo rugs of this period come either from Saxony <b>or</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> raveled cloth known in Spanish as bayeta, which was a woolen manufactured in England. With {{the arrival of the}} railroad in the early 1880s, another machine-produced yarn came into use in Navajo weaving: four-ply aniline dyed yarn known as Germantown because the yarn was manufactured in Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|The Liverpool and Manchester Railway {{had opened}} the {{previous}} year, and proved a remarkable success in abstracting traffic from the parallel canal, and indicated that longer distances, not merely feeders to a harbour <b>or</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> colliery, could be dealt with, and everywhere business people were considering where a railway might advantageously be built next. When the Grand Junction Railway was authorised in 1833, {{it was possible to}} consider that railways might one day link central Scotland and the south of England.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name Glastonbury is unclear but when the {{settlement}} is first recorded in the 7th and the early 8th century, it was called Glestingaburg. The burg element is Anglo-Saxon and could refer either to a fortified place such as a burh or, more likely, a monastic enclosure; however the Glestinga element is obscure, and may derive from an Old English word <b>or</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Saxon or Celtic personal name. It may derive from a person or kindred group named Glast.|$|E

5|$|Breathing {{air supply}} can come {{directly}} from a high-pressure breathing air compressor, from a high-pressure storage system, <b>or</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> combined storage system with compressor. Direct charging is energy intensive, and the charge rate will be limited by the available power source and capacity of the compressor. A large-volume bank of high-pressure storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders, and allows for provision of more economical high-pressure air by recharging the storage banks from a low-power compressor, or using lower cost off-peak electrical power.|$|E
5|$|Colin McRae Rally is {{a racing}} video {{game in which}} players can drive cars in {{point-to-point}} rally events. The game can be played from a behind-the-car perspective <b>or</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> bonnet camera view. On mobile devices, cars can be steered using on-screen buttons which provide digital input or using tilt controls which provide analog input. The game's content and driving model are taken directly from the 2000 title Colin McRae Rally 2.0. The game features thirty rally stages from Colin McRae Rally 2.0, located in Australia, Corsica, and Greece. Terrain and surfaces vary between stages ranging from smooth tarmac roads to gravely off-road tracks. Track information is provided through verbal descriptions from the co-driver and icons that appear {{near the top of}} the screen. The icons display the severity and difficulty of turns using colour-coding. A progress indicator is also displayed on screen, so that the player can see how much of the course they have completed and compare their position to the computer drivers.|$|E
5|$|During the Qing Dynasty's two-century {{rule over}} Taiwan, the {{population}} of Han on the island increased dramatically. However, {{it is not clear}} to what extent this was due to an influx of Han settlers, who were predominantly displaced young men from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in Fujian province, <b>or</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> variety of other factors, including: frequent intermarriage between Han and aborigines, the replacement of aboriginal marriage and abortion taboos, and the widespread adoption of the Han agricultural lifestyle due to the depletion of traditional game stocks, which may have led to increased birth rates and population growth. Moreover, the acculturation of aborigines in increased numbers may have intensified the perception of a swell in the number of Han.|$|E

While the NHL took steps to limit head trauma from blindslide hits, it was criticized for doing nothing to reduce fighting, which consists of repeated deliberate blows to the head. It is unknown if Boogaard's death was mainly attributed from his repeated head trauma from fighting and hits <b>or</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> possible addiction to painkillers while simultaneously abusing alcohol. His brain has been sent to Boston University for further testing.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lorenzo was {{a rapidly}} {{developing}} tropical cyclone that struck the Mexican state of Veracruz in late September 2007. The twelfth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, it {{formed in the}} southwestern Gulf of Mexico from a tropical wave. After meandering for two days without development, the storm began a steady westward track as its structure became better organized. In an 18‑hour period, Lorenzo's winds increased from 35mph (55km/h) to 80mph (130km/h), <b>or</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression to a hurricane. On September28 it struck near Tecolutla, Veracruz, a month after Hurricane Dean affected the same area, before it quickly dissipated over land.|$|E
5|$|Males perch after {{emerging}} from their nest. They pick out an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as {{to have a better}} chance of mating. They tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches. Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, <b>or</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> predator. One study by a behavioral ecologist, John Alcock, showed that a large majority of the marked wasps returned to the same perch day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Several congregating grounds are {{recently}} {{confirmed in}} Oceania, such as Perth Canyon off Rottnest Island, the Great Australian Bight off Portland, and in South Taranaki Bight and off Kahurangi Point which was discovered just in 2007 and was confirmed in 2014, representing possibly a unique population based on haplotypes. Southern blue and pygmy blue females use waters off Western Australia, and coastal areas of eastern North Island of New Zealand, from Northland waters {{such as the}} Bay of Islands and Hauraki Gulf to the Bay of Plenty in the south, as breeding and calving grounds. Whales off southern and western Australia are known to migrate into tropical coastal waters in Indonesia, Philippines, and off East Timor. (Animals in the Philippines {{may or may not}} originate from North Pacific populations <b>or</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> pygmy blue population in the northern Indian Ocean as whales regularly appear off Bohol, north of the Equator.) At least on occasions, whales also migrate through remote islands such as Cook Islands, and Chilean pelagic waters adjacent to Easter Island and Isla Salas y Gómez, where possibilities of undiscovered wintering grounds have been considered.|$|E
5|$|She {{was part}} of a {{flotilla}} which toured ports during the summer of 1889. Zhiyuans sole action was at the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894 during the First Sino-Japanese War. During the battle, she came under heavy fire from the Japanese forces. Having been holed, Deng ordered for the ship to ram an opposing vessel. She was destroyed as she closed, either by a hit on one of her torpedo tubes, <b>or</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Japanese torpedo. This attack, and the subsequent story of her captain and his dog have become embedded in popular culture in the People's Republic of China. A replica of the Zhiyuan was constructed in 2014 at the Port of Dandong, while the wreck was discovered in 2013 after a 16-year search.|$|E
5|$|The Musée suisse de l'appareil photographique at Vevey holds around 1,000 {{photographs}} taken for test purposes {{during the development}} of Michel's camera. Most of the photos were taken with 16mm orthopanchromatic Agfa film with a speed of ISO 8/10°. The exposed format was 10mm × 34mm. The quality was sufficient for a tenfold magnification. In the catalog of the 2007 exhibition Des pigeons photographes? they are classified as test photos on the ground <b>or</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> window, human perspectives from the ground or from elevated points, aeroplane-based aerial photographs, aerial photographs of relatively high altitude that were probably taken by pigeons released from a plane, and {{only a small number}} of typical pigeon photographs.|$|E

5|$|The Selle Français stud {{book has}} long allowed {{crossbreeding}} {{with four other}} breeds: the Thoroughbred, Arabian, Anglo-Arabian and French Trotter. Today, restrictions exist to harmonize the stud book with directives for other European warmblood breeds. For a Selle Français to be registered, it must be from two registered Selle Français parents <b>or</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> cross between a Selle Français and a facteur de selle français (non-Selle Français horse that has passed stud book selection procedures). Stallions must pass through a selection process before their progeny is allowed to be registered as Selle Français. The process involves an approval committee that judges stallions on criteria based on the age, breed and nationality of the horses. The qualification criteria involve the conformation, gaits, performance and are scored against national indices.|$|E
5|$|The main {{advantage}} of composite bows over self bows (made {{from a single}} piece of wood) is their combination of smaller size with high power. They are therefore more convenient than self bows when the archer is mobile, as from horseback, <b>or</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> chariot. Almost all composite bows are also recurve bows as the shape curves away from the archer; this design gives higher draw-weight {{in the early stages of}} the archer's draw, storing somewhat more total energy for a given final draw-weight. It would be possible to make a wooden bow that has the same shape, length and draw-weight as a traditional composite bow, but it could not store the energy, and would break before full draw.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} methods of burial: the coffin may be laid {{in a cave}} or in a carved stone grave, or hung on a cliff. It {{contains}} any possessions that the deceased will need in the afterlife. The wealthy are often buried in a stone grave carved out of a rocky cliff. The grave is usually expensive and takes {{a few months to}} complete. In some areas, a stone cave may be found that is large enough to accommodate a whole family. A wood-carved effigy, called Tau tau, is usually placed in the cave looking out over the land. The coffin of a baby or child may be hung from ropes on a cliff face <b>or</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> tree. This hanging grave usually lasts for years, until the ropes rot and the coffin falls to the ground.|$|E
