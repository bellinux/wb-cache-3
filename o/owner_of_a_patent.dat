50|$|A {{compulsory}} license provides that the <b>owner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> or copyright licenses {{the use of}} their rights against payment either set by law or determined through some form of adjudication or arbitration. In essence, under a {{compulsory license}}, an individual or company seeking to use another's intellectual property can do so without seeking the rights holder's consent, and pays the rights holder a set fee for the license. This is an exception to the general rule under intellectual property laws that the intellectual property owner enjoys exclusive rights that it may license - or decline to license - to others.|$|E
50|$|Patents, also {{referred}} to as patents for invention, are the most widespread means of protecting technical inventions.

Once a patent is granted by a state or by a regional office acting for several states, the <b>owner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> has the right to prevent anyone else from commercially exploiting the invention for a limited period, generally 20 years. The patent applicant must disclose the invention in order to obtain protection, and their rights can be enforced only within the territory in which the patent was granted.|$|E

[...] For example: Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Development Corp., Leitch Manufacturing Co. v. Barber Co., Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co., and B.B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis.

The Court concluded that the patentee's attempt to extend its monopoly power beyond the rights that the patent statute conferred on it was inequitable, {{and because of the}} patentee's [...] "unclean hands," [...] the court, as a court of equity, would not grant it relief.

40|$|This {{research}} examines United States and Japanese laws regarding {{patent rights}} in collaborative inventions, and inquires whether these laws may impede technology transfers by creating uncertainty regarding the ownership, validity, or enforceability {{of the resulting}} patents, or by imposing undue obstacles to the licensing or assignment of such patents. Where {{the laws of the}} two countries differ, this paper compares the merits of each approach and also assesses whether the differing approaches could be troublesome for cross-border transactions. One of the most significant differences between United States and Japanese law regarding joint inventions is in the requirement of consent for certain activities involving <b>a</b> jointly owned <b>patent.</b> In Japan, unlike the United States, all joint <b>owners</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> must consent to <b>a</b> non-exclusive license <b>of</b> the patent, or to the transfer <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single joint <b>owner’s</b> share, while in the United States, unlike Japan, <b>a</b> jointly owned <b>patent</b> cannot be enforced through an infringement action without the consent <b>of</b> all joint <b>owners.</b> Thus, while the consent requirements differ in the two countries, in each case they can present obstacles to the full enjoyment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> joint <b>owner’s</b> share <b>of</b> the patent. In both countries, the definition of joint inventorship is imprecise, and even honest mistakes in identifying which persons qualify as joint inventors can lead to invalidation. In the United States, such errors can often be corrected without invalidating the patent, but in Japan, no such correction mechanism exists. Finally, in light of recent Japanese court decisions on the subject of remuneration for employee inventions, employer allocations of remuneration in the future will need to carefully identify and quantify the respective contributions of all joint inventors. Such precision is generally not required in the United States...|$|R

5000|$|This inherent-right {{doctrine}} was expressly {{rejected a}} few years later, however, in Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co. In that case, Justice Holmes (who {{had been in the}} majority in the A.B. Dick case), now in dissent, argued that because the <b>owner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patented</b> teapot [...] "may keep his device wholly out of use [...] [...] [...] I cannot understand why he may not keep it out of use unless the licensee, or, for the matter of that, the buyer" [...] will agree to buy his tea from the patent owner. But the majority rejected this doctrine of patentees' [...] "inherent rights." [...] It explained:The argument is that, since the patentee may withhold his patent altogether from public use, he must logically and necessarily be permitted to impose any conditions which he chooses upon any use which he may allow of it. The defect in this thinking springs from the substituting of inference and argument for the language of the statute, and from failure to distinguish between the rights which are given to the inventor by the patent law and which he may assert against all the world through an infringement proceeding, and rights which he may create for himself by private contract, which, however, are subject to the rules of general, as distinguished from those of the patent, law. While it is true that, under the statutes as they were (and now are), a patentee might withhold his patented machine from public use, yet, if he consented to use it himself or through others, such use immediately fell within the terms of the statute, and, as we have seen, he is thereby restricted {{to the use of the}} invention as it is described in the claims of his patent, and not as it may be expanded by limitations as to materials and supplies necessary to the operation of it, imposed by mere notice to the public.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>patent</b> {{gives the}} patent owner {{the right to}} exclude others from making, using, selling, {{offering}} for sale, or importing into the U.S. the <b>patented</b> invention (i.e., <b>a</b> product embodying the invention) during the term of the patent. The constitutional rationale behind providing these exclusive rights is to “promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts” by providing inventors the incentive to invest their time, labor, and funds in researching and developing innovative technology. Providing these protections, however, comes with social costs (monopoly rents) and limits the public’s ability to freely alienate patented goods. Thus, public policy dictates that the patent owner’s exclusive rights be limited in scope. Generally, when <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> owner receives compensation {{for the use of}} his or her invention through sale <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patented</b> product, the purpose of patent law is fulfilled with respect to that product. Upon receiving compensation, the patent owner's rights to exclude others are exhausted and “the patent law affords no basis for restraining the use and enjoyment of the thing sold.” Accordingly, <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> <b>owner's</b> voluntary introduction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patented</b> product into commerce without restriction prevents the patent owner from exercising any claimed right to exclude others from using or reselling the sold product.|$|R

The facts were that the plaintiff was <b>owner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> covering {{a necessary part of}} the mechanism on moving picture projecting machines. This particular device was of such efficiency as to be in general use, to the practical exclusion of all substitutes. The plaintiff granted a license to manufacture and sell these parts, the licensee agreeing that it would not sell them except under agreement with each vendee, for himself and his assigns, that they should be used only with a certain type of film. This licensee sold a machine to an exhibition company which, in turn, transferred it to the defendant, the Prague Amusement Company. Thefe was no privity of contract between this defendant and the plaintiff, but the defendant took the machine with notice of the restriction. The defendant, the Universal Film Manufacturing Company, supplied films to the Prague Company for use on the machine, having itself been notified of the restriction. The question raised was whether the restriction upon the use of the machine was enforcible against one not a party to the agreement, but who had notice of it...|$|E
40|$|Under {{the patent}} and {{copyright}} laws, the <b>owner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> for an invention or of a copyright {{for a work}} {{has the right to}} sell, license or transfer it, to exploit it individually and exclusively, or even to decide to withhold it from the public. By contrast, under the antitrust laws, a unilateral refusal to deal may constitute an element of a violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, and the courts may then impose a duty on the violator to deal with others, including possibly with its actual or would-be competitors. The central question addressed by this Article arises from an attempt to harmonize these potentially conflicting principles: What {{is the extent to which}} the antitrust laws may impose a duty to deal on the owner of intellectual property? Two recent court of appeals decisions have taken notably different approaches to this question. In Image Technical Services v. Eastman Kodak, the Ninth Circuit held that, in the absence of legitimate business justifications, the defendant, the owner of copyright and patent rights, violated the Sherman Act by its refusal to sell or license the products subject to intellectual property protection to its competitors. In In re Independent Service Organizations Antitrust Litigation (Xerox), the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit expressly disagreed with the Ninth Circuit and rejected the proposition that even in the absence of those justifications, the antitrust laws might impose a duty on the owner of patents or copyrights to deal with competitors. On several occasions, albeit not in the context of intellectual property, the Supreme Court has recognized that the antitrust laws may impose a duty on a firm with market power to deal with its competitors. However, last Term, in Trinko, the Supreme Court limited the reach of some of those prior decisions. This Article explores this apparent - but in fact exaggerated - tension between the intellectual property regime and the antitrust laws.

5000|$|The {{construction}} of the patent law which justifies as valid the restriction of patented machines, by notice, to use with unpatented supplies necessary {{in the operation of}} them, but which are no part of them, is believed to have originated in Heaton-Peninsular Button-Fastener Co. v.

40|$|Standard Setting is omnipresent in {{networked}} information technologies. Virtually every cellular phone, computer, {{digital camera}} or similar device contains technologies {{governed by a}} collaboratively developed standard. If these technologies are to perform competitively, the processes by which standards are developed and implemented must be competitive. In this case attaining competitive results requires <b>a</b> mixture <b>of</b> antitrust and non-antitrust legal tools. FRAND refers to a firm’s ex ante commitment to make its technology available at a “fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory royalty. ” The FRAND commitment results from bidding to have one’s own technology selected as a standard. Typically the FRAND commitment is not a promise to charge any particular price, but only a price that meets FRAND expectations. This permits members <b>of</b> <b>a</b> standard setting organization (SSO) to focus on technical issues and worry about the price later. Two important questions that a FRAND commitment typically leaves open is the royalty base and the royalty rate. A strong {{case can be made}} that the base should be the smallest saleable unit containing the patented technology. While that base is not entirely free from problems, it does provide a more-or-less common currency. The FRAND obligation that the rate be nondiscriminatory typically, but not always, provides <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> yardsticks for measuring the rate. The non-practicing entity (NPE) that voluntarily declines to participate in an SSO process should generally be held to the FRAND royalty as its measure of its damages, even though its particular patents are not FRAND-encumbered. In this case a “reasonable” royalty is the royalty that the patent holder would have obtained in the competitive market in which it might have participated. The case for limiting NPE damages in this way is strongest when the NPE had actual or objectively reasonable knowledge of the SSO process but declined to participate. The case is weakest when the SSO’s processes were not well communicated to outsiders or the NPE in question was not permitted to participate. FRAND commitments should “run with the patent,” in the sense that <b>owners</b> <b>of</b> FRAND-encumbered patents should not be able to free them simply by assigning the patents to someone else. One fundamental principle of property law is that a property owner cannot transfer away a larger interest than it owns. The entire FRAND commitment process would be worthless if patent holders were able to evade it by the simple device of assigning encumbered patents in order to remove the encumbrance. The question of injunctive relief is only a little more complex. A FRAND commitment is on its face an offer to license to all who employ that patent in their standards-compatible product. True, the precise royalty terms are typically not specified in advance, but that entails that the FRAND royalty will be determined by reference to common indicia such as rates paid for similar technologies in the same or perhaps another situation. Further, the FRAND commitment effectively turns the royalty issues into <b>a</b> breach <b>of</b> contract claim rather than a litigated royalty claim. Permitting the <b>owner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> FRAND-encumbered <b>patent</b> to have <b>an</b> injunction against someone willing to pay FRAND royalties is tantamount to making the patent holder the dictator of the royalties, which once again is the same thing as no FRAND commitment at all...|$|R
