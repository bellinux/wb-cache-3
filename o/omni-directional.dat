5|$|Native Americans have {{inhabited}} the Table Rocks area {{for at least}} 15,000 years before European-American settlement. Starting in the mid-19th century during a gold rush, the settlers forced the Takelma tribe away from the Table Rocks and into reservations. The surrounding area was quickly developed. The Table Rock post office was established in 1872, an airstrip was built atop Lower Table Rock in 1948, and a very high frequency <b>omni-directional</b> range (VOR) aviation tower was constructed on Upper Table Rock in the 1960s. The Table Rocks were not protected until the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Prahaar is a solid-fueled surface-to-surface guided {{short-range}} tactical {{ballistic missile}} developed by DRDO of India. It would be equipped with <b>omni-directional</b> warheads and {{could be used for}} hitting both tactical and strategic targets. It has a range of about 150km. It was test-fired successfully on 21 July 2011 from the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Chandipur.|$|E
25|$|On December 23, 2009, WFAA {{filed an}} {{application}} to the FCC to obtain permission to increase its transmitter's effective radiated power (ERP) from 45kW through an <b>omni-directional</b> antenna to 55kW, through the installation of a directional antenna. The reasoning behind its proposal for the power increase was due to difficulties experienced by some viewers in portions of the Dallas–Fort Worth market who tried to maintain adequate over-the-air reception of the channel 8 digital signal.|$|E
25|$|Because of the above, St Helena Airport was {{equipped}} with an instrument landing system (ILS) and a Doppler VHF <b>Omni-directional</b> Radio Range system (DVOR) supplied by Thales Group. Further to that Honeywell Aerospace supplied a SmartPath ground-based augmentation system (GBAS), a technology that augments global positioning system (GPS) signals to make them suitable for precision approach and landing. It overcomes many {{of the limitations of}} instrument landing systems (ILS) traditionally used by airports to guide aircraft as they approach the runway.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of the B–T system in terms of mechanical simplicity was generally difficult to use in this role due to the normally small amount of energy it could tune. Several competing systems were also developed, including <b>omni-directional</b> antennae with motorized wire-mesh reflectors, {{as well as a}} Telefunken system that had multiple dipole antennae periodically switched by a large motorized distributor. In the end none of these systems proved very popular, and the success of B–T systems and small moving-loops suitable for higher frequencies used for aircraft communications allowed DF systems to be carried on the vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Lucero was {{connected}} to the Mk. VIII transmitter, and triggered its own 5µs signal every fifth transmission of the radar. The IFF Mk. III in the remote aircraft contained a receiver circuit fed into a transmitter, causing any received signal to be amplified and stretched out in time. This signal was received by the responder side of Lucero, which mixed it in with the signal from the Mk. VIII's own receiver. Since the Lucero antenna was <b>omni-directional,</b> the returns were continuous around the entire face of the display and unrelated to the position of the main dish. The result was a series of line segments, spaced every 10 degrees around the display.|$|E
25|$|The low {{probability}} of the 4f electrons existing at the outer {{region of the}} atom or ion permits little effective overlap between the orbitals of a lanthanide ion and any binding ligand. Thus lanthanide complexes typically {{have little or no}} covalent character and are not influenced by orbital geometries. The lack of orbital interaction also means that varying the metal typically has little effect on the complex (other than size), especially when compared to transition metals. Complexes are held together by weaker electrostatic forces which are <b>omni-directional</b> and thus the ligands alone dictate the symmetry and coordination of complexes. Steric factors therefore dominate, with coordinative saturation of the metal being balanced against inter-ligand repulsion. This results in a diverse range of coordination geometries, many of which are irregular, and also manifests itself in the highly fluxional nature of the complexes. As there is no energetic reason to be locked into a single geometry, rapid intramolecular and intermolecular ligand exchange will take place. This typically results in complexes that rapidly fluctuate between all possible configurations.|$|E
25|$|Piezoelectric {{systems can}} convert motion {{from the human}} body into {{electrical}} power. DARPA has funded efforts to harness energy from leg and arm motion, shoe impacts, and blood pressure for low level power to implantable or wearable sensors. The nanobrushes are {{another example of a}} piezoelectric energy harvester. They can be integrated into clothing. Multiple other nanostructures have been exploited to build an energy-harvesting device, for example, a single crystal PMN-PT nanobelt was fabricated and assembled into a piezoelectric energy harvester in 2016. Careful design is needed to minimise user discomfort. These energy harvesting sources by association affect the body. The Vibration Energy Scavenging Project is another project that is set up to try to scavenge electrical energy from environmental vibrations and movements. Microbelt can be used to gather electricity from respiration. Besides, as the vibration of motion from human comes in three directions, a single piezoelectric cantilever based <b>omni-directional</b> energy harvester is created by using 1:2 internal resonance. Finally, a millimeter-scale piezoelectric energy harvester has also already been created.|$|E

A 2,600mAh rechargeable battery will provide roughly 15 hours of wireless listening time and 500 hours on standby. The Big Jambox speakerphone is intended for more of a conference room setting and while the Jambox has a front-facing microphone, intended to be used facing a user, Big Jambox sports a top-mounted <b>omni-directional</b> microphone to pick up sound from all angles. Big Jambox is rated as class one speakerphone.|$|E

50|$|An {{exception}} to this are <b>omni-directional</b> IR jammers which do not make use of missile warning at all as they simply radiate modulated IR energy {{for as long as}} they are switched on. These jammers have been around since the 1970s and when the correct jamming modulation techniques were applied, were reasonably effective against 1st-generation amplitude-modulated MANPADS, which operated in the near-IR band (1 to 2 micrometres (µm)). The arrival of 2nd- and 3rd-generation MANPADS, however, changed that. They operate in the mid-IR band (3 to 5 µm) and make use of more advanced modulation techniques (for example frequency modulation). Therefore, instead of jamming these missiles, the <b>omni-directional</b> IR jammer now actually became a source for the missiles to home in.|$|E
