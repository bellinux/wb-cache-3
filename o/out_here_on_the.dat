500|$|The {{song was}} {{nominated}} for Best Metal Performance at the 49th annual Grammy Awards. When asked for his thoughts on the nomination, King revealed {{that he did not}} [...] "even care", and noted that Slayer fans [...] "don't give a shit and that's {{the most important thing to}} me". The interviewer expressed his surprise at the nomination given Slayer's [...] "inflammatory" [...] lyrics, to which King replied, [...] "That would be the coolest thing, you know? To win with the shit we write about." [...] The ceremony was held on February 11, 2007, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, with Slayer competing against Mastodon, Lamb of God, Ministry and Stone Sour. Slayer won the Best Metal Performance Grammy award, although the band was unable to attend because of a conflicting North American headlining tour. Araya commented about the win from a hotel room in Columbus, Ohio: [...] "Jeff [...] and I put a lot into 'Eyes of the Insane' so we're thrilled that the Grammy voters took the time to listen to it, and then vote for it. We're <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road and we're all really, really happy." [...] King disagreed, deeming the song [...] "one of the poorest representations of us [...] on the record [...] ". He further said that, if given the decision, he would have chosen the controversial track [...] "Jihad" [...] to represent Slayer from their ninth album Christ Illusion. Critical of the Recording Academy, King said, [...] "Realistically, I think people on the academy who vote pick the household name ... And that's what we are." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 31, 2009 it was {{announced}} on Metallica.com that the band felt that the song [...] "My Apocalypse" [...] {{was in need of}} an introduction when played live to [...] "set the mood". The statement on Metallica.com reads, [...] "We've been enjoying playing 'My Apocalypse' <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road but felt like it could use something extra. We decided that it needed a cool intro to set the mood so James wrote one. Check out and enjoy this free download... and make sure you learn it for singing along at a future show!" [...] The approximately minute-long introduction is available as a free MP3 download. The song had originally been debuted live on March 25, 2009, at the LG Arena in Birmingham, UK.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990 Powell {{received}} his highest career achievement, the Pulitzer Prize in Music, {{for his work}} [...] In a Los Angeles Times interview, Powell expressed complete surprise: [...] "Being <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coast, {{far away from the}} whole Eastern establishment to which the Pulitzer is connected – that made me a remote prospect. I just didn't expect it." [...] In an interview with The New York Times, Powell related the story of how Duplicates came from his service in World War II and an anecdote he heard in Paris about Claude Debussy's search for perfect music. That, Powell, stated was his goal for Duplicates. The work, commissioned in 1987 for the Los Angeles Philharmonic by music patron Betty Freeman, took Powell more than two years to complete. It was made even more difficult as his muscular dystrophy, previously affecting only his legs, began to afflict his arms and thus his ability to play the piano.|$|E

In {{order to}} study the post-fire bearing {{capacity}} and performance of the profiled sheet-light aggregate concrete composite floor after exposure to fire load, experimental study of post-fire bearing capacity of a profiled sheet-ceramsite concrete composite floor subjected to dead load, which has no shearing nails, is carried <b>out</b> <b>here.</b> Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> experimental results, the post-fire bearing capacity of the composite floor after exposure to fire is analyzed. It is shown that the failure form of the profiled sheet-lightweight concrete composite floor after exposure to fire has obvious change compared with the floor not subjected to fire load, and the ultimate value of the equivalent distributed load applied to the top surface of the floor is up to 35 kN/m 2, which {{may be used as}} basis of strengthening and repairing of the profiled sheet-lightweight aggregate concrete composite floor after exposure to fire...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} minimizing a function over a region defined by an arbitrary set, equality constraints, and constraints of the inequality type defined via a convex cone. Under some moderate convexity assumptions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> arbitrary set we develop Optimality criteria of the minimum principle type which generalize the Fritz John Optimality conditions. As a consequence of this result necessary Optimality criteria of the saddle point type drop <b>out.</b> <b>Here</b> convexity requirements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> functions are relaxed to convexity at the point under investigation. We then present the weakest possible constraint qualification which insures positivity of the lagrangian multiplier corresponding to the objective function...|$|R

The area of character recognition has been receiving considerable attention due to its versatile range of real-time application which includes reading aid for the blind, postal automation, processing of cheque and digitization of historical documents. Nowadays different methodologies for different language are in widespread use for character recognition. The work carried <b>out</b> <b>here</b> mainly concentrates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> recognition accuracy of the language. The proposed scheme consists of 4 stages: preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and recognition. Preprocessing techniques resulting for better accuracy such as noise removal, gray scale conversion and binarization are employed to enhance the character before classification. The neural network classifier methodology is implemented to recognize the character. Index Terms — character recognition, feature extraction, preprocessing, neural network classifier I...|$|R
6000|$|MY DEAR PEOPLE,--A week in Paris reduced {{me to the}} {{limpness}} {{and lack}} of appetite peculiar to a kid glove, and gave Fanny a jumping sore throat. It's my belief there is death in the kettle there; a pestilence or the like. We came <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> pitched <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Star and Garter (they call it Somebody's pavilion), found the place a bed of lilacs and nightingales (first time I ever heard one), and also of a bird called the piasseur, cheerfulest of sylvan creatures, an ideal comic opera in itself.

Well, the place (forest of beeches all new-fledged, grass like velvet, fleets of hyacinth) pleased us and did us good. We tried all ways to find a cheaper place, but could find nothing safe; cold, damp, brick-floored rooms and sich; we could not leave Paris till your seven days' sight on draft expired; we dared {{not go back to}} be miasmatised in these homes of putridity; so here we are till Tuesday in the Star and Garter.
