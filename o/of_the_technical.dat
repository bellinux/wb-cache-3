5|$|Baden was not {{originally}} intended to be surrendered {{under the terms of}} the Armistice, but was substituted for the battlecruiser Mackensen, which lay incomplete and could not put to sea. As a result, instead of joining the High Seas Fleet when it departed for Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918, Baden left Germany on 7 January 1919. The Royal Navy inspected the ship on 9 January, but many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>technical</b> instruments, including gunnery equipment, had been removed before the ship left Germany.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Resident Evil 3 was released, {{development}} on Code: Veronica was nearing completion. Much of Code: Veronicas 70-person development staff was outsourced because Capcom resources had been tied up working on Resident Evil 3. Shinji Mikami and Yoshiki Okamoto's team at Flagship oversaw the game's scenario and direction, while XAX Entertainment assisted with environments and Nextech handled much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>technical</b> development. Capcom Production Studio 4 still handled art direction and character design. By September 1999, Sega was sending {{some of its}} own developers to help add final touches to the game. Sega assisted Capcom with the game's programming to help keep a good framerate.|$|E

5|$|Metagenomics allows {{researchers}} {{to access the}} functional and metabolic diversity of microbial communities, but it cannot show which of these processes are active. The extraction and analysis of metagenomic mRNA (the metatranscriptome) provides information on the regulation and expression profiles of complex communities. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>technical</b> difficulties (the short half-life of mRNA, for example) {{in the collection of}} environmental RNA there have been relatively few in situ metatranscriptomic studies of microbial communities to date. While originally limited to microarray technology, metatranscriptomcs studies have made use of transcriptomics technologies to measure whole-genome expression and quantification of a microbial community, first employed in analysis of ammonia oxidation in soils.|$|E

This {{was less than a}} month before the shooting of the location filming for Quatermass II began, and necessitated the casting of a replacement lead actor at short notice; John Robinson was chosen to fill the part. Robinson was an experienced actor from a range of different films and television programmes since the 1930s, but was uncomfortable about taking over from Tate, and had difficulty in learning some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>technical</b> dialogue he was required to deliver.

5|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} of the serval {{have remained in}} dispute; in 1997, palaeontologists M.C. McKenna and S.K.

Studies in the 2000s and the 2010s show that the serval, along with the caracal and the African golden cat, forms {{one of the eight}} lineages of Felidae.
