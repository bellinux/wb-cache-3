5|$|<b>Outdoor</b> <b>air</b> pollutants, {{especially}} chemicals {{released from}} the burning of fossil fuels, {{increase the risk of}} lung cancer. Fine particulates (PM2.5) and sulfate aerosols, which may be released in traffic exhaust fumes, are associated with slightly increased risk. For nitrogen dioxide, an incremental increase of 10 parts per billion increases the risk of lung cancer by 14%. <b>Outdoor</b> <b>air</b> pollution is estimated to account for 1–2% of lung cancers.|$|E
5|$|People {{who live}} in large cities have {{a higher rate of}} COPD {{compared}} to people {{who live in}} rural areas. While urban air pollution is a contributing factor in exacerbations, its overall role as a cause of COPD is unclear. Areas with poor <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> quality, including that from exhaust gas, generally have higher rates of COPD. The overall effect in relation to smoking, however, is believed to be small.|$|E
5|$|Hypothermia {{is reduced}} body {{temperature}} {{that happens when}} a body loses more heat than it generates. Hypothermia is a major limitation to swimming or diving in cold water. The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which in turn {{increases the risk of}} other injuries. Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air, so water temperatures that would be tolerable as <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> temperatures can lead to hypothermia, which may lead to death from other causes in inadequately protected divers.|$|E

5|$|Most {{cases of}} COPD can be {{prevented}} by reducing exposure to risk factors. This includes decreasing rates of smoking and improving indoor and <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> quality. While treatment can slow worsening, there is no cure. COPD treatments include stopping smoking, vaccinations, respiratory rehabilitation, and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids. Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation. In those who have periods of acute worsening, increased use of medications and hospitalization may be needed.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} (a sudden worsening of symptoms) {{is commonly}} triggered by infection or environmental pollutants, or sometimes by other {{factors such as}} improper use of medications. Infections {{appear to be the}} cause of 50 to 75% of cases, with bacteria in 25%, viruses in 25%, and both in 25%. Environmental pollutants include both poor indoor and <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> quality. Exposure to personal smoke and secondhand smoke increases the risk. Cold temperature may also play a role, with exacerbations occurring more commonly in winter. Those with more severe underlying disease have more frequent exacerbations: in mild disease 1.8 per year, moderate 2 to 3 per year, and severe 3.4 per year. Those with many exacerbations have a faster rate of deterioration of their lung function. Pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the lungs) can worsen symptoms in those with pre-existing COPD. Signs of PE in COPD include pleuritic chest pain and heart failure without signs of infection.|$|E

30|$|In North America, {{heat pump}} {{manufacturers}} provide standard performance factors {{to their customers}} {{for the purpose of}} comparison between models.

25|$|Dilution {{of indoor}} {{pollutants}} with <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> is effective {{to the extent}} that <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> is free of harmful pollutants. Ozone in <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> occurs indoors at reduced concentrations because ozone is highly reactive with many chemicals found indoors. The products of the reactions between ozone and many common indoor pollutants include organic compounds that may be more odorous, irritating, or toxic than those from which they are formed. These products of ozone chemistry include formaldehyde, higher molecular weight aldehydes, acidic aerosols, and fine and ultrafine particles, among others. The higher the outdoor ventilation rate, the higher the indoor ozone concentration and the more likely the reactions will occur, but even at low levels, the reactions will take place. This suggests that ozone should be removed from ventilation air, especially in areas where outdoor ozone levels are frequently high. Recent research has shown that mortality and morbidity increase in the general population during periods of higher outdoor ozone and that the threshold for this effect is around 20 parts per billion (ppb).|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} sources of air {{pollution}} include particulates, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide.

40|$|AbstractEnergy {{recovery}} ventilators (ERVs) transfer energy {{between the}} air exhausted from {{building and the}} <b>outdoor</b> supply <b>air</b> to reduce the energy consumption associated with the conditioning of ventilation air. Higher ventilation rates improve the IAQ by diluting pollutants such as airborne particles and VOC. On the other hand, {{studies have shown that}} higher ventilation rates increase the building energy consumption in a majority of cases, especially during the hot summer season. Therefore, more energy is required to provide the space with more <b>outdoor</b> ventilation <b>air</b> and consequently better IAQ. The ERVs is important equipment for indoor air conditioning. The study results show that the ERVs can be energy saving and reduce indoor air pollution of modern buildings, improve indoor work and living environment. Testing for energy recovery ventilators and energy saving analysis with air-conditioning systems, the result can provide basic principle and referenced data for product improvement and air-conditioning system design...|$|R

25|$|In {{water heating}} applications, a heat pump {{may be used}} to heat or preheat water for {{swimming}} pools or heating potable water for use by homes and industry. Usually heat is extracted from <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> and transferred to an indoor water tank, another variety extracts heat from indoor air to assist in cooling the space.|$|E
25|$|A {{heat pump}} uses an {{electrically}} driven compressor {{to operate a}} refrigeration cycle that extracts heat energy from <b>outdoor</b> <b>air,</b> the ground or ground water, and moves that heat to the space to be warmed. A liquid contained within the evaporator section of the heat pump boils at low pressure, absorbing heat energy from the <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> or the ground. The vapor is then compressed by a compressor and piped into a condenser coil within the building to be heated. The heat from the hot dense gas is absorbed by {{the air in the}} building (and sometimes also used for domestic hot water) causing the hot working fluid to condense back into a liquid. From there the high pressure fluid is passed back to the evaporator section where it expands through an orifice and into the evaporator section, completing the cycle. In the summer months, the cycle can be reversed to move heat out of the conditioned space and to the outside air.|$|E

25|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOC) - VOCs are a well-known <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> pollutant. They are categorized as either methane (CH4) or non-methane (NMVOCs). Methane {{is an extremely}} efficient greenhouse gas which contributes to enhanced global warming. Other hydrocarbon VOCs are also significant greenhouse gases because of their role in creating ozone and prolonging the life of methane in the atmosphere. This effect varies depending on local air quality. The aromatic NMVOCs benzene, toluene and xylene are suspected carcinogens and may lead to leukemia with prolonged exposure. 1,3-butadiene is another dangerous compound often associated with industrial use.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) {{estimates}} that each year 2.4 million premature deaths from <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> pollution could be avoided. Particularly hazardous for health are emissions of black carbon, {{a component of}} particulate matter, which is a known cause of respiratory and carcinogenic diseases and a significant contributor to global climate change. The links between greenhouse gas emissions and particulate matter make low carbon transport an increasingly sustainable investment at local level—both by reducing emission levels and thus mitigating climate change; and by improving public health through better air quality.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of indoor unit heat {{transfer}} area and air flow rate and <b>outdoor</b> unit <b>air</b> flow rate on the system performance of residential air-conditioner were experimentally investigated under rated cooling and heating conditions. The experimental {{results showed that the}} system cooling capacity, EER, heating capacity and COP all had evident variation with indoor unit heat transfer area and air flow rate and out unit air flow rate, which predicated that there was a proper match range for indoor unit and outdoor unit to make the system overall performance best. The increase of indoor unit heat transfer area and air flow rate significantly improved system cooling and heating performances especially for the smaller heat transfer area indoor unit, and the improvement was more obvious for heating performance. The heat transfer area ratio of indoor unit and outdoor unit was smaller, the indoor unit air flow rate should be designed as higher air velocity, but that should not be higher than 1. 2 m/s. In addition, with the specified outdoor unit in this study, the matched heat transfer area of indoor unit should not be too high or too low, and the optimal heat transfer area ratio of indoor and outdoor unit was between 0. 33 and 0. 37, which was better to choose the smaller value for higher indoor unit air flow rate. The increase of <b>outdoor</b> unit <b>air</b> flow rate also was advantageous for improving system cooling and heating performances especially for system EER and COP, but excessive higher air flow rate can cause the degradation of the system performance. The proposed <b>outdoor</b> unit designed <b>air</b> velocity should not be higher than 1. 6 m/s...|$|R

25|$|Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a {{relatively}} easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants emitted by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high indoors may cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 PPM whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 PPM. Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are {{an indicator of the}} adequacy of <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.|$|E
25|$|Also, as {{the heat}} pump takes heat {{out of the}} air, some {{moisture}} in the <b>outdoor</b> <b>air</b> may condense and possibly freeze on the outdoor heat exchanger. The system must periodically melt this ice; this defrosting translates into an additional energy (electricity) expenditure. When it is extremely cold outside, it is simpler to heat using an alternative heat source (such as an electric resistance heater, oil furnace, or gas furnace) rather than to run an air-source heat pump. Also, avoiding {{the use of the}} heat pump during extremely cold weather translates into less wear on the machine's compressor.|$|E
40|$|The {{commercial}} {{use of a}} plant production system with artificial light (PPAL) is limited by its high initial construction and operation costs. The electric-energy consumed by heat pumps, applied mainly for cooling, accounts for 15 - 35 % of the total electric-energy used in a PPAL. To reduce the electric-energy consumption, an air exchanger with low capacity (180 W) was used for cooling by introducing <b>outdoor</b> cold <b>air.</b> In this experiment, the indoor air temperature in two PPALs (floor area: 6. 2 m 2 each) was maintained at 25 ºC and 20 ºC during light and dark periods, respectively, for lettuce production. In one PPAL (PPALe), an air exchanger (air flow rate: 250 m 3 h- 1) was used along with a heat pump (cooling capacity: 3. 2 kW) to maintain the indoor air temperature at the set-point. The other PPAL (PPALc) with only a heat pump (cooling capacity: 3. 2 kW) was used for reference. Effects of introducing <b>outdoor</b> cold <b>air</b> on energy use efficiency, coefficient of performance (COP), electric-energy consumption for cooling and growth of lettuce were investigated. The results show that: when the air temperature difference between indoor and outdoor ranged from 20. 2 °C to 30. 0 °C: 1) the average energy use efficiency of the air exchanger was 2. 8 and 3. 4 {{times greater than the}} COP of the heat pumps in the PPALe and PPALc, respectively; 2) hourly electric-energy consumption in the PPALe reduced by 15. 8 - 73. 7 % compared with that in the PPALc; 3) daily supply of CO 2 in the PPALe reduced from 0. 15 kg to 0. 04 kg compared with that in the PPALc; 4) no significant difference in lettuce growth was observed in both PPALs. The results indicate that using air exchanger to introduce <b>outdoor</b> cold <b>air</b> should be considered as an effective way to reduce electric-energy consumption for cooling with little effects on plant growth in a PPAL...|$|R
