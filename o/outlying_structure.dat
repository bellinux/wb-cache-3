50|$|As {{a result}} of this further expansion, the college {{continued}} to build new facilities. A dining hall was constructed in 1871 and an assembly hall followed the next year. These buildings were placed between the two halls, connecting them and creating what would also be known as the East Building. A fire on February 4, 1875, destroyed much of the interior of Taylor Hall, although the <b>outlying</b> <b>structure</b> remained intact. Because of this, the building was able to be restored for less than half the cost of the original construction, although collegiate education was forced to be canceled for several weeks and did not fully return to its prior state for over a year afterward. 1875 also saw the construction of yet another new building, which housed both a gymnasium and a chemistry laboratory.|$|E
50|$|College or {{university}} campus area networks often interconnect {{a variety of}} buildings, including administrative buildings, academic buildings, university libraries, campus or student centers, residence halls, gymnasiums, and other <b>outlying</b> <b>structures,</b> like conference centers, technology centers, and training institutes.|$|R
50|$|The Pomeroy Living History Farm is a 501(c)(3) {{non-profit}} farm museum on the National Register of Historic Places. Located in Yacolt, Washington, {{the site}} is an interactive recreation of a 1920s working farm, based on the original Pomeroy family's 1910 home and <b>outlying</b> <b>structures</b> and occupying 60 of the property's full 667 acre.|$|R
50|$|Viscount Cary {{lived in}} a large manor house {{that seems to have}} been built in or before {{the early part of the}} 17th century and seems to have been {{extended}} in the latter part of the 17th century. It was demolished in about 1800 (see below) but <b>outlying</b> <b>structures</b> from about 1700 including its stables, dovecote and stone gatepiers survive.|$|R
5000|$|The Eshkol {{region has}} {{been the target of}} {{thousands}} of rocket attacks since 2000. Despite Iron Dome coverage in the region, usage of the system is generally limited to populated areas and allows other rockets to land in open areas. As a result, there has been widespread damage to farms, vehicles and various <b>outlying</b> <b>structures.</b> During the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, farmers reported massive damages to their crops due to rockets landing in open fields.|$|R
50|$|By the mid-1850s hot {{and cold}} spring resorts existed in 20 states. Many of these resorts {{contained}} similar architectural features. Most health resorts had a large, two-story central building near or at the springs, with smaller structures surrounding it. The main building provided the guests with facilities for dining, and possibly, dancing on the first floor, and the second story consisted of sleeping rooms. The <b>outlying</b> <b>structures</b> were individual guest cabins, and other auxiliary buildings formed a semicircle or U-shape around the large building.|$|R
50|$|A {{large number}} of {{photographs}} of the Castle's exterior and interior, and its <b>outlying</b> <b>structures,</b> including details of the Castle's unique architectural features (such as its sgraffiti-clad windows), are published in Richard Konwiarz's book Alt-Schlesien (1913). The book speaks of the Castle's front staircase leading to the garden as the historically significant architectural element, and the gardens themselves with their intricate layout as ranking {{on the same level}} of importance. A photograph of the theatre's interior, including the stage and the seating area, was published in the monthly periodical Schlesische Monatshefte: Blätter für Kultur und Schrifttum der Heimat of March 1933. The numerous pictorial representations of Grafenort Palace include works of Friedrich Bernhard Werner (16901776) and Josef Schall (17851867).|$|R
5000|$|E-Groups {{are named}} after “Group E” at the Classic period site of Uaxactun, {{which was the}} first one {{documented}} by Mesoamerican archaeologists. [...] At Uaxactun, the Group E complex consists of a long terraced platform with three supra-structures arranged along a linear axis oriented north-south. The two smaller <b>outlying</b> <b>structures</b> flank the larger central temple. A stairway leads down to a plaza formed by Uaxacatun’s Pyramid E-VII. Three stele immediately front the E-Group, and a larger stele is located midway between Group E and Pyramid E-VII. Each of the four stairways incorporated into the complex (the main central one and three leading up to each supra-structure) bears two side masks (for a total of 16).|$|R
2500|$|A shell ignited {{flammable}} materials, {{damaged the}} northwestern position {{and killed the}} four Israelis manning it. The incessant shelling also caused damage to the village's water tower. Approximately 100m3 in volume, it burst open at about 10:00 and flooded defensive trenches and munitions, also hurting communications. All of the 3" [...] mortar rounds were put out of commission. At 10:25, some 100 Egyptian infantrymen breached the fence there, using a small opening {{that had been used}} by the locals, and captured three <b>outlying</b> <b>structures,</b> including the nursery school. Hearing of the situation, Haim Bar-Lev, serving as the acting commander of the Negev Brigade due to the injury of Nahum Sarig, ordered Israel Carmi (commander of the 9th Battalion) to send reinforcements.|$|R
5000|$|Broadview {{became a}} popular target for vandalism, and also {{attracted}} paranormal investigators as rumors began to surface that the facility was haunted by former patients. Its windows were boarded {{and the city}} erected a chain-link fence to keep out would-be explorers. General Assembly voted to sell Broadview Center to the City of Broadview Heights. In the Broadview closure, the local County Board of MR/DD, Cuyahoga County, developed the community alternatives, and community outcomes were improved.https://web.archive.org/web/20110726034151/http://www.equipforequality.org/publications/cipp_final.doc In the Broadview closure, parents were active stakeholders in a state-sponsored Oversight Committee, and they helped to establish the criteria for what was needed to support their son or daughter in the community. It remained in this condition until 1995, when the general Assembly voted to sell Broadview Center to the City of Broadview Heights.http://www.broadview-heights.org/abouthistory.html The city of Broadview Heights purchased the Developmental Center {{from the state of}} Ohio for $750,000.http://www.clevelandpress.com/clnews-september.htmhttp://www.broadview-heights.org/abouthistory.html The city tore down many of the <b>outlying</b> <b>structures</b> including the cottages, and built a new police station on the grounds. The building was partially renovated and transformed into a community center with an indoor swimming pool and recreational facilities. During the renovation, city inspectors discovered a significant asbestos threat, forcing a temporary delay in construction while the hazardous substance was removed.http://www.clevelandpress.com/clnews-september.htm ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine a}} {{possible}} supergroup {{in the direction}} of the Eridanus constellation using 6 dF Galaxy Survey second data release (6 dFGS DR 2) positions and velocities together with 2 MASS and HyperLEDA photometry. We perform a friends-of-friends analysis to determine which galaxies are associated with each substructure before examining the properties of the constituent galaxies. The overall structure is made up of three individual groups that are likely to merge to form a cluster of mass ∼ 7 × 10 13 M⊙. We conclude that this structure is a supergroup. We also examine the colours, morphologies and luminosities of the galaxies in the region with respect to their local projected surface density. We find that the colours of the galaxies redden with increasing density, the median luminosities are brighter with increasing environmental density and the morphologies of the galaxies show a strong morphology-density relation. The colours and luminosities of the galaxies in the supergroup are already similar to those of galaxies in clusters, however the supergroup contains more late-type galaxies, consistent with its lower projected surface density. Due to the velocity dispersion of the groups in the supergroup, which are lower than those of clusters, we conclude that the properties of the constituent galaxies are likely to be a result of merging or strangulation processes in groups <b>outlying</b> this <b>structure...</b>|$|R
25|$|During {{the late}} period the Cucuteni-Trypillia {{territory}} {{expanded to include}} the Volyn region in northwest Ukraine, the Sluch and Horyn Rivers in northern Ukraine and along both banks of the Dnieper river near Kiev. Members of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture who lived along the coastal regions near the Black Sea {{came into contact with}} other cultures. Animal husbandry increased in importance, as hunting diminished; horses also became more important. The community transformed into a patriarchal <b>structure.</b> <b>Outlying</b> communities were established on the Don and Volga rivers in present-day Russia. Dwellings were constructed differently from previous periods, and a new rope-like design replaced the older spiral-patterned designs on the pottery. Different forms of ritual burial were developed where the deceased were interred in the ground with elaborate burial rituals. An increasingly larger number of Bronze Age artefacts originating from other lands were found {{as the end of the}} Cucuteni-Trypillia culture drew near.|$|R
40|$|We have mapped {{the inner}} 360 '' regions of M 51 in the 158 micron [CII] line at 55 '' spatial {{resolution}} using the Far-infrared Imaging Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FIFI) on the Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO). The emission is peaked at the nucleus, but is detectable {{over the entire}} region mapped, which covers much of the optical disk of the galaxy. There are also two strong secondary peaks at ~ 43 % to 70 % of the nuclear value located roughly 120 '' to the north-east, and south-west of the nucleus. These secondary peaks are at the same distance from the nucleus as the corotation radius of the density wave pattern. The density wave also terminates at this location, and the <b>outlying</b> spiral <b>structure</b> is attributed to material clumping due to the interaction between M 51 and NGC 5195. This orbit crowding results in cloud-cloud collisions, stimulating star formation, that we see as enhanced [CII] line emission. The [CII] emission at the peaks originates mainly from photodissociation regions (PDRs) formed on the surfaces of molecular clouds that are exposed to OB starlight, so that these [CII] peaks trace star formation peaks in M 51. The total mass of [CII] emitting photodissociated gas is ~ 2. 6 x 10 ^{ 8 } M_{sun}, or about 2 % of the molecular gas as estimated from its CO(1 - 0) line emission. At the peak [CII] positions, the PDR gas mass to total gas mass fraction is somewhat higher, 3 - 17 %, and at the secondary peaks the mass fraction of the [CII] emitting photodissociated gas can {{be as high as}} 72 % of the molecular mass [...] (continued) Comment: 14 pages, 6 figures, Accepted in ApJ (for higher resolution figures contact the author...|$|R
40|$|Data {{acquired}} during several multiday {{periods in}} 1982 at ground stations Siple, Halley, and Kerguelen and on satellites DE 1, ISEE 1, and GEOS 2 {{have been used}} to investigate thermal plasma structure and dynamics in the duskside plasmasphere bulge region of the Earth. The distribution of thermal plasma in the dusk bulge sector is difficult to describe realistically, {{in part because of the}} time integral manner in which the thermal plasma distribution depends upon the effects of bulk cross-B flow and interchange plasma flows along B. While relatively simple MHD models can be useful for qualitatively predicting certain effects of enhanced convection on a quiet plasmasphere, such as an initial sunward entrainment of the outer regions, they are of limited value in predicting the duskside thermal plasma structures that are observed. Furthermore, use of such models can be misleading if one fails to realize that they do not address the question of the formation of the steep plasmapause profile or provide for a possible role of instabilities or other irreversible processes in plasmapause formation. Our specific findings, which are based both upon the present case studies and upon earlier work, include the following: (1) during active periods the plasmasphere appears to become divided into two entities, a main plasmasphere and a duskside bulge region. The latter consists of outlying or outward extending plasmas that are the products of erosion of the main plasmasphere; (2) in the aftermath of an increase in convection activity, the main plasmasphere tends (from a statistical point of view) to become roughly circular in equatorial cross section, with only a slight bulge at dusk; (3) the abrupt westward edge of the duskside bulge observed from whistlers represents a state in the evolution of sunward extending streamers; (4) in the aftermath of a weak magnetic storm, 10 to 30 % of the plasma ''removed'' from the outer plasmasphere appears to remain in the afternoon-dusk sector beyond the main plasmasphere. This suggests that plasma flow from the afternoon-dusk magnetosphere into the boundary layers is to some extent impeded, possibly through a mechanism that partially decouples the high altitude and ionospheric-level flow regimes; (5) <b>outlying</b> dense plasma <b>structures</b> may circulate in the outer duskside magnetosphere for many days following an increase in convection, unless there is extremely deep quieting; (6) a day-night plasmatrough boundary may be identified in equatorial satellite data; (7) factor-of- 2 -to- 10 density irregularities appear near the plasmapause in the postdusk sector in the aftermath of weak magnetic storms; (8) during the refilling of the plasmatrough from the ionosphere at L = 4. 6, predominantly bidirectional field aligned and equatorially trapped light ion pitch angle distributions give way to a predominantly isotropic distribution (as seen by DE 1) when the plasma density reaches a level a factor of about 3 below the saturated plasmasphere level; (9) some <b>outlying</b> dense plasma <b>structures</b> are effectively detached from the main plasmasphere, while others appear to be connected to that body...|$|R
40|$|The active ellipses method [1] for {{assessing}} wear in total hip replacements (THRs) uses robust ellipse fitting. Radiopaque debris cause <b>structured</b> <b>outlying</b> points {{to which a}} standard algebraic least squares (LS) fit [2]. Most conventional fitting uses an algebraic error function causing errors in fitting eccentric ellipses {{such as those of}} the acetabular rim. LS with a geometric error function [3] shows a similar performance. Robust Least Median of Squares (LMedS) [4] ellipse fitting uses variations on the algebraic distance or a geometric approximation such as the foci bisector. Use of the geometric distance is computationally expensive, but today’s computational power and the availability of a geometric error algorithm have increased the feasibility of its use. In this paper the performance of these geometric error with direct comparison with other error functions is evaluated. Additionally the accuracy of active ellipse measurements made was examined using geometric, foci bisector and algebraic error functions. Synthetic test data for the differing ellipse fitting methods using 38 points sampled along an elliptical arc from known parameters. These were corrupted by a sine wave and by Gaussian noise {{in the direction of the}} normal. 500 sets of points were created for each level of noise, clutter or probability of outliers. Two ellipses were considered with eccentricities of 0. 80 and 0. 98. LS fits using geometric and algebraic error functions and LMedS fits (without fine tuning) using algebraic, weighted algebraic by gradient, foci bisector and geometric error functions were considered. The difference between the original and recovered centre points was used as a score of performance...|$|R
