It was flown to Australia for analysis. It carried a stencilled code 676EB, which identified {{it as part of}} a Boeing 777 flap track fairing, and the style in which the lettering was painted onto the fairing matched stencils used by Malaysia Airlines, making it almost certain that the part came from 9M-MRO.|$|E

Merkmallen then travels to the U.S. to meet with Steven Sandoz, an American University biologist who has a third artifact. However, he is murdered by a man posing as Sandoz; when the real Sandoz finds the body, he flees.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{appeared}} in four (out of five) Beatles' films. During {{the filming of}} the Beatles' first feature film, A Hard Day's Night, Evans {{appeared in}} a cameo role, carrying an upright bass in between John Lennon and Millie in the backstage scene in which Millie mistakes Lennon for someone else. In Help!, Evans played a confused channel swimmer who pops up through an ice-hole in Austria, and <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>beach</b> <b>in</b> the Bahamas. Evans and Aspinall were asked to find and hire the actors that were needed to perform in the Magical Mystery Tour film, and to hire an old 60-seater coach, on which {{they were told to}} paint the Magical Mystery Tour logo, which McCartney had designed. Evans later appeared in the film as one of the magicians, who cast mysterious spells on the passengers of the bus.|$|E

5|$|The North American {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Chris Milk and filmed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in March 2005. The music video, however, was discarded by the record label, though this version won four Annual MVPA Awards. The video begins with Bedingfield waking up next to a boombox, dressing, brushing her teeth and leaving her home with the boombox. While performing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>beach</b> <b>in</b> New York City, she kicks her boombox, which comes alive and begins to dance, and she leaves the beach and walks down the street. The video concludes with Bedingfield arriving back home to {{a house full of}} dancing boomboxes in the bedroom.|$|E
5|$|Using {{alternating}} first-person perspectives, {{the novel}} tells {{the stories of}} Little Bee, a Nigerian refugee, and Sarah O'Rourke (née Summers), a magazine editor from Surrey. After spending two years detained in a British immigration detention centre, Little Bee is illegally released after a fellow refugee performs sexual favours for a detention officer. She travels {{to the home of}} Sarah and her husband Andrew, whom she met two years previously <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>beach</b> <b>in</b> the Niger Delta. Sarah is initially unaware of Little Bee's presence, until Andrew, haunted by guilt of their shared past, commits suicide.

5|$|Afterward, Andy grows {{determined}} {{to escape from}} Shawshank, and informs Red {{that he is going}} to Zihuatanejo in Mexico, telling him that if he should ever get out of prison, he should go to a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, and there will be a volcanic rock, and a gift for him under it. During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In a fury, Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of David Cassidy on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing a hole through Cassidy's rectum. Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of Friends, allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a parole board and complains that the concept of rehabilitation is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; for no apparent reason, Red is put on parole anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>beach</b> <b>in</b> Zihuatanejo, eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red never does.|$|E

Although it was long believed that Finger was buried in an unmarked potter's field grave, his body was claimed by his son Fred, who honored his wish to be cremated, and spread his ashes {{in the shape of a}} bat <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>beach</b> <b>in</b> Oregon.|$|E
25|$|PLO {{attacks from}} Lebanon into Israel in 1977 and 1978 {{escalated}} {{tensions between the}} countries. On 11 March 1978, eleven Fatah fighters landed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>beach</b> <b>in</b> northern Israel and proceeded to hijack two buses full of passengers on the Haifa – Tel-Aviv road, shooting at passing vehicles in {{what became known as}} the Coastal Road massacre. They killed 37 and wounded 76 Israelis before being killed in a firefight with Israeli forces. Israel invaded Lebanon four days later in Operation Litani. The Israeli Army occupied most of the area south of the Litani River. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 425 calling for immediate Israeli withdrawal and creating the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), charged with attempting to establish peace.|$|E
25|$|Often, {{masturbation}} in {{the sight}} of others is prosecuted under a general law such as public indecency, though some laws make specific mention of masturbation. In the UK, masturbating in public is illegal under Section 28 of the Town Police Clauses Act 1847. The penalty may be up to 14 days in prison, depending on a range of circumstantial factors. In the US, laws vary from state to state. In 2010, the Supreme Court of Alabama upheld a state law criminalizing the distribution of sex-toys. In the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, masturbating in public is a class 3 misdemeanour. In 2013, a man found masturbating openly <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>beach</b> <b>in</b> Sweden was cleared of charges of sexual assault, the court finding that his activities had not been directed towards any specific person.|$|E
