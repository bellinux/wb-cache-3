5|$|The Chicken Big King {{was added}} April 2014.

This new sandwich uses the company's existing Crispy Chicken Jr patty in place of the beef and adds an extra layer of King sauce to ensure that the product stays moist.|$|E
5|$|During the 1973–1975 biennium, {{pressure}} {{was put on}} Kappa Kappa Psi chapters by their host institutions to admit women to comply with Title IX. The issue was again brought up at the 1975 national convention, and a joint committee consisting of {{an equal number of}} members from Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma was formed to explore the legal possibilities <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>corporate</b> merger of the two organizations, with the results of their investigation to be read at the 1977 convention. At the 1977 national convention, votes were cast by the Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma delegations for a merger—Kappa Kappa Psi voted 211 against, 9 for; Tau Beta Sigma voted 104 against, 4 for. With the idea of a merger soundly defeated, the delegation voted to remove all references to gender from the constitution, allowing women to become active members in full and regular standing.|$|E

5|$|E.P. Arnold Royalton, {{owner of}} {{conglomerate}} Royalton Industries, offers Speed an astoundingly luxurious lifestyle {{in exchange for}} signing to race with him. Speed is tempted but declines due to his father's distrust of power-hungry corporations. Angered, Royalton reveals that for many years the key races have been fixed by corporate interests, including Royalton himself, to gain profits. Royalton takes out his anger on Speed by having his drivers force Speed into a crash that destroys the Mach 6 and suing Racer Motors for intellectual property infringement. Speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through Inspector Detector, head <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>corporate</b> crimes division. Racer Taejo Togokahn {{says that he has}} evidence that could indict Royalton but will only offer it up if Speed and the mysterious masked Racer X agree to race on his team in the Casa Cristo 5000. Taejo says that a win could substantially raise the stock price of his family's racing business, blocking a Royalton-arranged buyout. Speed agrees but keeps his decision secret from his family, and Inspector Detector's team makes several defensive modifications to the Mach 5 to assist Speed in the rally.|$|E
5|$|Strategic design {{management}} involves {{the creation of}} strategic long-term vision and planning for design, and deals with defining the role of design within the company. The goal of strategic {{design management}} is to support and strengthen the corporate visio by creating {{a relationship between the}} design and corporate strategy. It includes the creation of design, brand and product strategies, ensuring that design management becomes a central element in the corporate strategy formulation process.

25|$|He {{retained}} {{a seat on}} the board of directors until 1984, when he resigned in the midst <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>corporate</b> takeover battle. This began a series of events that ultimately led to the replacement of Ronald William Miller (husband of Walt's daughter Diane Marie Disney) by Frank Wells and Michael Eisner as president and CEO, respectively. While investors were attempting the hostile takeover of Disney with the intention of dismantling the company and selling off its assets, Roy organized a consortium of white knight investors to fend off the takeover attempts. With the introduction of Wells and Eisner, Roy returned to the company as vice-chairman of the board of directors and chairman of the animation department, which became Walt Disney Feature Animation.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues relating to corporate governance reports (e. g. the “Relazione sulla Corporate Governance” for Italian listed firms) refers to their ability to provide both professional and non-professional users with <b>a</b> complete set <b>of</b> information regarding the quality <b>of</b> <b>an</b> entity’s <b>corporate</b> governance practices. In fact, these reports generally provide disclosures about the compliance <b>of</b> <b>an</b> entity’s <b>corporate</b> governance system through the information set required by a specific law or industry code. These information are generally regarded as providing <b>an</b> indication <b>of</b> the quality <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given <b>corporate</b> governance system (CG quality). Is there a correlation between the degree of sensitivity to control themes and the quality <b>of</b> <b>an</b> entity’s <b>corporate</b> governance practices? To answer this question, we assess the quality of one of the main actors of corporate governance, the internal auditing function. We then test the IAD index on <b>a</b> sample <b>of</b> Italian listed firms and conclude that there is a significant association between full compliance to corporate governance regulations for listed firms (Borsa Italiana 2011) and an increasing sensibility to themes relating to control systems – as measured through the IAD Index – for the sample being considered...|$|R
