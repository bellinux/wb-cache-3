25|$|Partial {{oophorectomy}} or <b>ovariotomy</b> {{is a term}} {{sometimes used}} to describe a variety of surgeries such as ovarian cyst removal or resection of parts of the ovaries. This kind of surgery is fertility-preserving, although ovarian failure may be relatively frequent.

5000|$|West {{was working}} quite {{successfully}} {{as a general}} practitioner and surgeon in Tonbridge. In 1837 West published in The Lancet the first surgery of ovariectomy, describing how he removed an ovarian cyst with a size of about 20 pints (11.3 liters [...] ). The patient recovered well, and the cyst was placed {{on display at the}} Museum of Guy's Hospital. His colleague and friend, John Gorham published {{a couple of years later}} several of the <b>ovariotomies</b> made by West.|$|R
25|$|As he {{specialized}} in certain gynecological surgeries (particularly hemorrhoidectomies and <b>ovariotomies)</b> and gastrointestinal surgeries, he developed various instruments for these operations including specialized hooks and retractors, a heated operating table, and an aseptic drainage tube used in abdominal surgery. Additionally, Kellogg took {{keen interest in}} devising instruments for light therapy, mechanical exercising, proper breathing, and pure water. His medical inventions spanned {{a wide range of}} applications and included a hot air bath, vibrating chair, oscillomanipulator, window tent for fresh air, pneumograph to graphically represent respiratory habits, loofah mitt, and apparatus for home sterilization of milk. Some of his inventions were even considered fashionable enough {{to be found in the}} first class gymnasium of the Titanic.|$|R
50|$|Baker Brown {{opened a}} medical {{practice}} in Connaught Square, London in 1834 and soon {{became known as}} a specialist in gynaecology. In 1845, {{he was one of}} the founders of St Mary's Hospital, London. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1848. In 1858 he founded the London Surgical Home for Women and worked on advancing surgical procedures. He began to perform <b>ovariotomies</b> on women, including his own sister. In 1864, he was the first person to describe a surgical treatment for stress incontinence involving a suprapubic cystostomy procedure. He was elected president of the Medical Society of London in 1865. In 1866, Baker Brown described the use of clitoridectomy as a cure for several conditions, including epilepsy, catalepsy and mania, which he attributed to masturbation. In On the Curability of Certain Forms of Insanity, Epilepsy, Catalepsy, and Hysteria in Females, he gave a 70 per cent success rate using this treatment.|$|R
25|$|Gynaecology and Obstetrics gained {{attention}} in the American medical field {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century through the development of such procedures as the <b>ovariotomy.</b> These procedures then were shared with European surgeons who replicated the surgeries. It should be noted that this was a period when antiseptic, aseptic or anaesthetic measures were just being introduced to surgical and observational procedures and without these procedures surgeries were dangerous and often fatal. Following are two surgeons noted for their contributions to these fields include Ephraim McDowell and James Marion Sims.|$|E
25|$|Ephraim McDowell {{developed}} a surgical practice in 1795 and performed the first <b>ovariotomy</b> in 1809 on a 47-year-old widow who then lived on for thirty-one more years. He {{had attempted to}} share this with John Bell whom he had practiced under who had retired to Italy. Bell {{was said to have}} died without seeing the document but it was published by an associate in Extractions of Diseased Ovaria in 1825. By the mid-century the surgery was both successfully and unsuccessfully being performed. Pennsylvanian surgeons the Attlee brothers made this procedure very routine for a total of 465 surgeries–John Attlee performed 64 successfully of 78 while his brother William reported 387– between the years of 1843 and 1883. By {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century this procedure was successfully performed in Europe by English surgeons Sir Spencer Wells and Charles Clay as well as French surgeons Eugène Koeberlé, Auguste Nélaton and Jules Péan.|$|E
500|$|Ine's {{mother died}} in 1869. [...] About this time Ine studied {{obstetrics}} in Nagasaki with Antonius Bauduin, who pioneered <b>ovariotomy</b> there and {{was appointed to the}} Tōkō national medical school in Tokyo, which had just been renamed from Edo and where the Emperor had moved after his restoration. [...] After other moves Ine also settled in Tokyo. [...] There she became acquainted with Takako's half-brother Ishii Kendō, the son of Ishii Sōken. [...] Ine maintained contact in Tokyo with her half-brother Alexander, who worked for the British legation, and another half-brother Heinrich, who had worked there as an interpreter for the Austro-Hungarian legation since 1869.|$|E
2500|$|Pioneer {{heroine of}} {{abdominal}} surgery Jane Todd {{is buried in}} Sullivan County. [...] Born in Virginia in 1763, she and her husband, Thomas Crawford, moved to Green County, Kentucky, in 1805. Suffering from a huge abdominal tumor, she rode [...] to Danville, Kentucky, to submit to an operation never before performed. On December 25, 1809, Dr. Ephraim McDowell performed this, the first <b>ovariotomy,</b> in his home. The ordeal lasted 25 minutes. There was no anesthesia. [...] Mrs. Crawford recovered completely and years later came to Graysville {{to live with her}} son, Thomas, a Presbyterian minister. She died in 1842 at age 78. The restored McDowell home in Danville, Kentucky is a surgical shrine.|$|E

50|$|Thomas Keith came to specialise in {{gynaecology}} and in 1862 performed {{his first}} <b>ovariotomy</b> (excision of ovarian cyst) {{but in the}} years 1853-56 he devoted {{much of his time}} to photography.|$|E
50|$|Tait's first success {{came with}} his {{demonstration}} that <b>ovariotomy</b> {{could be done}} safely. While Ephraim McDowell had successfully performed the first <b>ovariotomy</b> in Kentucky in 1809, mortality for this operation was over 90%. In his first paper in 1872, Tait reported only 1 death out of nine cases, a major breakthrough. His techniques of use of intraabdominal ligatures for the ovarian pedicle {{in favor of an}} extraperitoneal clamp, abdominal closure, and meticulous surgical cleanliness were novel and important for abdominal surgery. With further recognition, he was instrumental in the opening of the Birmingham Hospital for Women where he worked for 20 years.|$|E
5000|$|After 1856 Keith devoted {{himself to}} surgery and in {{particular}} to the then new and controversial procedure of <b>ovariotomy.</b> The first documented successful performance of this procedure was by Ephraim McDowell (1771-1830) in Kentucky in 1809. McDowell had studied surgery in Edinburgh under John Bell (1763-1820) who described the operation but never performed it. Bell’s successor in Edinburgh John Lizars (1787-1860), was sent McDowell’s account and he performed the first successful <b>ovariotomy</b> in Britain, publishing the results in 1825. [...] Surgeons like Charles Clay (1801-1893) in Manchester and Thomas Spencer Wells (1818-1897) in London began to perform the procedure regularly, but the mortality rate was so high that mainstream medical opinion {{felt that it was}} too dangerous to perform. [...] Keith performed his first <b>ovariotomy</b> in 1862, having learned the technique from Spencer Wells. From the outset he recorded his results in detail. His early mortality rate was consistently lower [...] that of other published series like Spencer Wells Keith further reduced the mortality rate to 4% when he began to use antiseptic technique, taught to him by his lifelong friend Joseph Lister.|$|E
50|$|Among {{his better}} known {{publications}} were works on ovarian pathology, uterine tumors {{and the formation}} of carcinomas following <b>ovariotomy.</b> In 1908 he was the first physician to give a comprehensive description of familial icterus gravis neonatorum.|$|E
50|$|Although his merits in {{this matter}} have {{sometimes}} been denied, his claim to the title Father of <b>Ovariotomy</b> is now generally conceded, and it is admitted that he deserves the credit not only of having shown how that operation could be made a success, but also of having played {{an important part in}} the advance of abdominal surgery for which the 19th century was conspicuous. A number of manuscripts previously owned by Clay are held by Special Collections at the University of Manchester and include a record of some of the <b>ovariotomy</b> (oophorectomy) operations he performed between 1855 and 1869, further details can be found here.|$|E
50|$|He was {{professor}} of {{surgery at the}} Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and senior surgeon at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. He performed the first <b>ovariotomy</b> in Scotland in 1825. One of his pupils was Charles Darwin.|$|E
5000|$|While {{working as}} a privatdozent at the University of Kiel he {{conducted}} important research on fetal respiration in utero, publishing the treatise [...] "Die vorzeitigen Athembewegungen" [...] (1858) as a result. In 1876 he performed the first <b>ovariotomy</b> using aseptic safeguards at the Göttingen Frauenklinik.|$|E

50|$|After the war, Safford studied medicine, {{graduating from}} the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women in 1869. She also studied at Vienna General Hospital, the University of Breslau, and the University of Heidelberg. At Breslau, {{she was the first}} woman to perform an <b>ovariotomy.</b> While {{studying}} at Heidelberg, she befriended Isabel Chapin Barrows, the first American woman ophthalmologist.|$|E
50|$|A {{dispute over}} <b>ovariotomy,</b> which other members opposed, led Barnes {{to leave and}} found the British Gynaecological Society in 1884. In the {{election}} for the presidency {{at the end of}} that year, matters came to a head when Alfred Meadows, supported by Aveling and Barnes, failed to be chosen by the Council. In 1907 both societies merged into the Royal Society of Medicine.|$|E

50|$|In 1875, {{an article}} was {{published}} in a regional medical journal regarding Cleveland's performance of an <b>ovariotomy</b> in a patient who had been suffering from a cystic tumor of the ovary that had led to a large fluid collection within the abdomen. One of Cleveland's students wrote the journal article, making a concluding point that Cleveland's work was evidence that women could make good surgeons.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas Keith MA, MD, LL.D., FRCSEd (27 May 1827 - 9 October 1895 [...] ), was a Victorian {{surgeon and}} amateur {{photographer}} from Scotland. He developed and improved the wax paper process and his photographs are recognised for their composition {{and use of}} shade. He was an early practitioner of the operation of <b>ovariotomy</b> (ovarian cystectomy) where his published results were amongst {{the best in the}} world.|$|E
50|$|His {{success in}} complex {{surgical}} cases {{gave him a}} great reputation. For long he was noted as the only surgeon who had succeeded {{in the operation of}} <b>ovariotomy</b> in a London hospital. This occurred in 1846, when anaesthetics were unknown. He did much to popularize colotomy. A successful operator, he nevertheless was attached to conservative surgery, and was always more anxious to teach his pupils how to save a limb than how to remove it.|$|E
50|$|Jeaffreson {{was born}} on 23 November 1931 in the United Kingdom from a {{well-known}} surgical family descended from Framlingham, Surrey, which {{is said to have}} performed the first successful <b>ovariotomy</b> in England. Jeaffreson was born to Bryan Leslie Jeaffreson (1896 - 1953) and Margaret Jeaffreson. His father was a Physician who was qualified as a Medical Doctor, Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and Member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.|$|E
