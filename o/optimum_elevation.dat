By comparing the altitudinal distribution of 171 forest plant species between 1905 and 1985 and 1986 and 2005 along the entire elevation range (0 to 2600 meters above sea level) in west Europe, we show that climate warming has resulted in a significant upward shift in species <b>optimum</b> <b>elevation</b> averaging 29 meters per decade.

In this paper, we compare receiving signal strength on two scenarios 1) an empty road and 2) a road with a vehicle. We investigate the effect of antenna polarization and antenna height to the receiving signal strength. The transmitting antenna is installed on the road surface. The receiving signal is measured 360 degrees around the transmitting antenna with the radius of 2. 5 meters. Measurement results show the receiving signal fluctuation around the transmitting antenna in both scenarios. Receiving signal with vertical polarization antenna results in higher signal strength than horizontal polarization antenna. The <b>optimum</b> antenna <b>elevation</b> is 1 meter for both horizon and vertical polarizations with the vehicle on the road.

30|$|Effect of {{elevation}} on {{yield of}} jatropha is {{manifested in the}} damage imposed by frost since frost is {{a direct consequence of}} elevation. It was explained by several researchers that jatropha is unable to withstand frost (Heller [1996]; Grass [2009]). Experiences in different countries indicate that the <b>optimum</b> <b>elevation</b> for growth and productivity of jatropha ranges from sea level to 1500 meters above sea level (Muok and Kallback [2008]; Brittaine and Lutaladio [2010]) because at this elevation, risk of frost is minimal. Altitudes from 1500 to 2150 meters above sea level are moderately suitable. All areas above 2150 meters are not suitable for jatropha production because of frost (ICRAF [2009]). So, elevation data was classified into the three levels of suitability (S 1, S 2 and N 1).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the methodology of}} a DEM generation from stereo aerial images {{and the results of}} experiments in terms of accuracy of generated DEM. In this study, Images, which have 1 / 10000 and 1 / 16000 scale, and a test area established about 1 km 2 in Selcuk University Campus Area were used. Aerial photographs were scanned by ZEISS SCAI Photogrammetric Scanner (pixel size is 21 µ). Aerial images, which have 1 / 10000 scale, were restitutied by Zeiss Planicomp P 3 Analytical Instrument. The DEM, which belong to test area, were produced by progressive, selective and composite sampling methods. We have developed a new software on PC’s that can automatically generate DEM from stereo aerial images for restitution of images 1 / 16000 scale. In this software, pixel and image coordinates of points in left and right image are calculated by using colinearity equations. Left and right windows are matched and this process is repeated in various ±∆Z range. Elevation values obtained from the best-fixed matching are automatically selected as <b>optimum</b> <b>elevation</b> value. Elevation values of points in the test area are calculated by bilinear interpolation method which uses coordinates of above points (X,Y,Z). Moreover, Elevations of points in test area are manually produced from PHOTOMOD software.

This {{is the case of}} Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in the Mediterranean Basin where uncertainties in relation to its dynamics under these changing scenarios are still high. We analysed the relative effect of climate on the recruitment patterns of Scots pine and its interactions with local biotic and abiotic variables at different spatial scales. Number of seedlings and saplings was surveyed, and their annual shoot growth measured in 96 plots located across altitudinal gradients in three different regions in the Iberian Peninsula. We found a significant influence of climate on demography and performance of recruits, with a non-linear effect of temperature on the presence of juveniles, and a positive effect of precipitation on their survival. Abundance of juveniles of P. sylvestris that underwent their first summer drought was skewed towards higher altitudes than the altitudinal mean range of the conspecific adults and the <b>optimum</b> <b>elevation</b> for seedlings ’ emergence. At local level, light availability did not influence juveniles ’ density, but it enhanced their growth. Biotic interactions were found between juveniles and the herb cover (competition) and between the number of newly emerged seedlings and shrubs (facilitation).

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 25 - 28, 1993 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaDuring {{shallow water}} exercises, the {{performance}} of acoustic tracking and telemetry systems is degraded by severe multipath interference. The feasibility of an optical source attached to the underwater vehicle (UV) and a tracking aircraft-based receiver was theoretically established. Supporting water absorption and surface interaction experiments were also performed. The limiting case was the tracking of an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV). The requirements of daylight operation, atmospheric visibility, limited space and weight, self-contained power, exercise duration, sample rate, optimum search area, robustness in varying scattering and sea states, non-cooperating (except for low-data-rate communications of information such as depth) source and receiver, and relative simplicity, lead to two optimum candidate systems. One system uses a commercially available 5 megawatt q switched and double laser diode pumped YAG laser operating at 532 nm and 1 Hz rep rates. The second system uses a pulsed (2 μsec) zenon flash tube. Both systems satisfy the robustness constraint by intentional beam spreading. A performance constraint of 10 : 1 signal to noon solar upwelling shot noise ratio was imposed. This constraint can be met for water depths of 10 and 5 absorption lengths, respectively, for the laser and incoherent systems. An optimum search diameter of approximately 700 meters (m) at an <b>optimum</b> aircraft <b>elevation</b> of 3, 000 meters is calculated for both systems.

40|$|Thin plate {{smoothing}} splines incorporating {{varying degrees}} of topographic dependence were used to interpolate 100 daily rainfall values, with the degree of data smoothing determined by minimizing the generalised cross validation. Analyses were performed on the square roots of the rainfall values. Model calibration was made difficult by short range correlation and {{the small size of}} the data set. Short range correlation was partially overcome by removing one point from each of the five closest pairs of data points. An additional five representative points were removed to make up a set of 10 withheld points to assess model error. Three dimensional spline functions of position and elevation, from digital elevation models of varying resolution, were used to assess the <b>optimum</b> scaling of <b>elevation</b> and an <b>optimum</b> DEM resolution of 10 km. A linear sub-model, depending on the two horizontal components of the unit normal to the scaled DEM, was used to form a five dimensional partial spline model which identified a south western aspect effect. This model also had slightly smaller estimated predictive error. The model was validated by reference to the prevailing upper atmosphere wind field and by comparing predictive accuracies on 367 withheld data points. Model selection was further validated by fitting the various spline models to the 367 data points and using the 100 data points to assess model error. This verified that there were small, but significant, elevation and topographic aspect effects in the data, when calculated from a 10 km resolution DEM, providing a physical explanation for the short range correlation identified by the two dimensional analysis in the companion paper...|$|R
40|$|The peanut {{is one of}} the {{important}} crops in Taiwan. There are various species, including Tainan 11, Tainan Selected 9, Tainan 14, and Tainong 6, etc. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the rate of water absorption of peanuts under different soaking conditions. In this study, the peanut species Tainan 14 was used as the experimental subject. It was soaked in three different soaking conditions to investigate the changes in the physical and chemical properties. The parameters of soaking processes included different temperatures and different concentrations of sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride solutions. The results showed that the highest water absorption (49. 6 g/ 100 g) was obtained after soaking the samples in 50 �C for 6 hours, which was considered as the <b>optimum</b> condition. Also, <b>elevations</b> in temperature and soaking concentration led to higher levels of solution absorption, total solid loss and seed coat shedding. In the sensory evaluation of the boiled peanuts, after treatment with the best soaking conditions, statistical analysis revealed that peanut samples soaked in 50 �C hot water was ranked lower than the untreated peanuts. However, the result was still acceptable by the consumers. In sum, our experimental results showed that the water absorption of soaked peanuts was significantly affected by temperature. The textures of peanut samples were softened due to the increased moisture content. Thus, the soaking treatment could help shorten the cooking time and save energy costs, and prevent the deterioration of product quality through the reduced cooking time. 中文摘要 [...] 	I 英文摘要 [...] 	II 目錄 [...] 	III 表次 [...] 	V 圖次 [...] 	VI 	 1 、文獻整理 [...] 	 1 1. 1. 豆類概要 [...] 	 1 1. 2. 花生簡介 [...] 	 1 1. 3. 花生品種介紹 [...] 	 3 1. 4. 花生營養組成 [...] 	 5 1. 5. 花生產業狀況 [...] 	 11 2 、研究目的 [...] 	 15 3 、材料與方法 [...] 	 16 3. 1. 實驗設計 [...] 	 16 3. 2. 實驗材料 [...] 	 16 3. 3. 樣品製備 [...] 	 16 3. 4. 實驗方法 [...] 	 16 3. 4. 1. 一般組成分分析 [...] 	 16 3. 4. 1. 1. 水分 [...] . 	 16 3. 4. 1. 2. 灰分 [...] . 	 18 3. 4. 1. 3. 粗脂肪 [...] . 	 18 3. 4. 1. 4. 粗蛋白質 [...] . 	 18 3. 4. 1. 5. 碳水化合物 [...] . 	 18 3. 4. 2. 吸水率 [...] 	 19 3. 4. 3. 總固形物 [...] 	 19 3. 4. 4. 消費者感官品評 [...] 	 19 3. 4. 5. 統計分析 [...] 	 19 4 、結果與討論 [...] 	 22 4. 1. 花生成分分析 [...] 	 22 4. 2. 溫度對花生吸水率的影響 [...] 	 22 4. 2. 1. 不同浸漬溫度測試 [...] 	 22 4. 2. 2. 經殺菁處理的浸漬結果 [...] 	 25 4. 3. 碳酸氫鈉溶液對花生吸水率的影響 [...] 	 27 4. 4. 氯化鈉溶液對花生吸水率的影響 [...] 	 32 4. 5. 浸漬液色澤及總固形物溶出之比較 [...] 	 37 4. 6. 浸漬外觀的比較 [...] 	 49 4. 7. 消費者喜好性感官品評 [...] 	 49 5 、結論 [...] 	 58 6 、參考文獻 [...] 	 59 表次 表 1 - 1 、	豆類依成分分類表 [...] 	 2 表 1 - 2 、	食品中真菌毒素限量標準 [...] 	 4 表 1 - 3 、	花生品種介紹 [...] 	 6 表 1 - 4 、	我國 91 - 100 年落花生生產量值 [...] . 	 12 表 1 - 5 、	台灣各地區落花生生產量值(101 年) [...] 	 13 表 3 - 1 、	水煮花生感官品評問卷 [...] . 	 20 表 4 - 1 、	花生的一般組成分 [...] 	 23 表 4 - 2 、	花生於不同浸漬溫度下浸漬 360 分鐘後其吸水率比較 [...] 	 26 表 4 - 3 、	花生經 100 °C殺菁 10 分鐘處理，再於不同浸漬溫度下浸漬 360 分鐘後其吸水率比較 [...] . 	 29 表 4 - 4 、	 20 °C水溫下於不同濃度的碳酸氫鈉溶液浸漬 360 分鐘後 其吸水率比較 [...] 	 31 表 4 - 5 、	 50 °C水溫下於不同濃度的碳酸氫鈉溶液浸漬 360 分鐘後其吸水率比較 [...] 	 34 表 4 - 6 、	 20 °C水溫下於不同濃度的氯化鈉溶液浸漬 360 分鐘後其吸水率比較 [...] 	 36 表 4 - 7 、	 50 °C水溫下於不同濃度的氯化鈉溶液浸漬 360 分鐘後其吸水率比較 [...] 	 39 表 4 - 8 、	水煮花生之消費者喜好性分析 [...] 	 56 圖次 圖 1 - 1 、	花生種子結構 [...] 	 7 圖 1 - 2 、	白藜蘆醇之化學結構 [...] 	 10 圖 3 - 1 、	實驗架構 [...] 	 17 圖 4 - 1 、	於不同浸漬溫度過程中花生水分含量的變化 [...] 	 24 圖 4 - 2 、	於不同浸漬溫度過程中經殺菁處理花生水分含量的變化 [...] 	 28 圖 4 - 3 、	 20 °C水溫下於不同濃度的碳酸氫鈉溶液浸泡過程中花生水分含量的變化 [...] 	 30 圖 4 - 4 、	 50 °C水溫下於不同濃度的碳酸氫鈉溶液浸漬過程中花生水分含量的變化 [...] 	 33 圖 4 - 5 、	 20 °C水溫下於不同濃度的氯化鈉溶液浸漬過程中花生水分含量的變化 [...] 	 35 圖 4 - 6 、	 50 °C水溫下於不同濃度的氯化鈉溶液浸泡過程中花生水分含量的變化 [...] 	 38 圖 4 - 7 、	花生浸漬於不同溫度下其浸漬液之顏色變化 [...] 	 40 圖 4 - 8 、	經殺菁處理的花生浸漬於不同溫度下其浸漬液之顏色變 化 [...] 	 41 圖 4 - 9 、	花生浸漬於 20 °C不同濃度碳酸氫鈉溶液其浸漬液之顏色變化 [...] 	 42 圖 4 - 10 、	花生浸漬於 50 °C不同濃度碳酸氫鈉溶液其浸漬液之顏色變化 [...] 	 43 圖 4 - 11 、	花生浸漬於 20 °C不同濃度氯化鈉溶液其浸漬液之顏色變化 [...] 	 44 圖 4 - 12 、	花生浸漬於 50 °C不同濃度氯化鈉溶液其浸漬液之顏色變化 [...] 	 45 圖 4 - 13 、	花生浸漬於 20 °C、 30 °C、 40 °C、 50 °C及 60 °C水溫下 6 小時，其固形物溶出率的比較 [...] 	 46 圖 4 - 14 、	花生浸漬於 20 °C及 50 °C碳酸氫鈉溶液 6 小時，其固形物溶出率的比較 [...] 	 47 圖 4 - 15 、	花生浸漬於 20 °C及 50 °C氯化鈉溶液 6 小時，其固形物溶出率的比較 [...] 	 48 圖 4 - 16 	花生浸漬於 20 、 30 、 40 、 50 及 60 °C水溫下 6 小時後的外觀變化 [...] 	 50 圖 4 - 17 、	花生經殺菁處理後，浸漬於 20 、 30 、 40 、 50 及 60 °C水溫下 6 小時後的外觀變化 [...] . 	 51 圖 4 - 18 、	花生於水溫 20 °C下分別浸漬於不同濃度之碳酸氫鈉溶液(0. 3 、 0. 5 、 1 及 5 g/ 100 ml) 6 小時後的外觀變化 [...] . 	 52 圖 4 - 19 、	花生於水溫 50 °C下分別浸漬於不同濃度之碳酸氫鈉溶液(0. 3 、 0. 5 、 1 及 5 g/ 100 ml) 6 小時後的外觀變化 [...] . 	 53 圖 4 - 20 、	花生於水溫 20 °C下分別浸漬於不同濃度之氯化鈉溶液(0. 3 、 1 、 2 及 3 g/ 100 ml) 6 小時後的外觀變化 [...] 	 54 圖 4 - 21 、	花生於水溫 50 °C下分別浸漬於不同濃度之氯化鈉溶液(0. 3 、 1 、 2 及 3 g/ 100 ml) 6 小時後的外觀變化 [...] 	 5...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} the {{navigation}} processing module of a low cost GPS receiver, in order to study the GPS errors characterization and modeling. The navigation data are recorded using a low cost GPS receiver antenna, and post-processed using GPS post-processing algorithms used in RTKLIB C++ package. This method allowed us to study and simulate errors variation {{in the case of a}} single positioning mode. An important focus was given to the Dilution of Precision (DOP) characterization of GPS errors, on the computed solution by a software post-processing. The DOP parameter showed a good indication of the quality of the GPS positioning solution, when using good satellite geometry. For navigation processing, it is usually convenient to choose the lowest value of DOP (DOP < 4) in order to minimize the GPS errors. But often, this is to choose some satellites with low elevations angles. As a solution for this issue, the best case is obtained when choosing a minimum DOP with best and <b>optimum</b> <b>elevation</b> angle. The experience was carried out using a fixed antenna receiver, where the effects of other sources of errors such as multipath were reduced. In this case, we compare the performances of using all the satellites in view, to choosing the optimum geometry obtained using 4 satellites generated by a quasi-optimal algorithm. This two are employed to be compared and to calculate the constellation's DOP and the corresponding receiver's position error. Results show that it s better to deal with best satellites geometry, and an accurate correlation between DOP and resulting errors can be obtaine...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{fingerprints}} {{of climate}} change on tree species distribution are usually detected at latitudinal or altitudinal extremes (arctic or alpine tree line), where temperatures {{play a key role}} in tree species distribution. However, early detection of recent climate change effects on tree species distribution across the overall temperature gradient remains poorly explored. Within French mountain forests, we investigated altitudinal distribution differences between seedling (≤ 50 cm tall and > 1 yr old) and adult (> 8 m tall) life stages for 17 European tree taxa, encompassing the entire forest elevation range from lowlands to the subalpine vegetation belt (50 – 2250 m a. s. l.) and spanning the latitudinal gradient from northern temperate to southern Mediterranean forests. We simultaneously identified seedlings and adults within the same vegetation plots. These twin observations gave us the equivalent of exactly paired plots in space with seedlings reflecting a response to the studied warm period (1986 – 2006) and adults reflecting a response to a former and cooler period. For 13 out of 17 species, records of the mean altitude of presence at the seedling life stage are higher than that at the adult life stage. The low altitudinal distribution limit of occurrences at the seedling life stage is, on average, 29 m higher than that at the adult life stage which is significant. The high altitudinal distribution limit also shows a similar trend but which is not significant. Complementary analyses using modelling techniques and focusing on the <b>optimum</b> <b>elevation</b> (i. e. the central position inside distribution ranges) have confirmed differences between life stages altitudinal distribution. Seedlings optima are mostly higher than adults optimum, reaching, on average, a 69 m gap. This overall trend showing higher altitudinal distribution at the seedling life stage in comparison to the adult one suggests a main driver of change highly related to elevation, such as climate warming that occurs during the studied period. Other drivers of change that could play an important role across elevation or act at more specific scales are also discussed as potential contributors to explain our results...|$|E
40|$|In {{the face}} of recent changes in {{environmental}} conditions and climate, longterm studies provide important insights into patterns and processes of vegetational change. In northern Europe, however, long-term studies are rare for many ecosystems. This thesis uses a new approach that uses historical phytosociological data-sets to study changes in the vegetation of alpine, mire, and arctic habitats and regions across northern Europe over the past decades. Because plot relocation due {{to the use of}} non-permanent plots may bias the detection of change, the thesis investigates if observed changes are larger than what is expected by chance. Furthermore, to find out if observed changes in vegetation are consistent between different habitats and regions in northern Europe, a meta-analysis of 15 data sets from arctic, alpine, and mire sites is presented. The results of the resurvey conducted in alpine Sikkilsdal, Central Norway, show that most species have shifted their distributional range upwards along the elevational gradient since the first sampling in the 1920 s. These upward shifts were found to be independent of whether upper, lower, or <b>optimum</b> <b>elevation</b> were considered. As the largest shifts were found for species growing in snow-bed habitats, the results suggest climate warming and alterations in snow-cover duration to be important drivers of the observed range shifts. In the Åkhult mire (South Sweden), changes over a period of 54 years were found predominantly for species of dwarf-shrubs and trees, whereas several typical mire species have decreased or disappeared from the study site. Drier mire surface and higher nutrient availability due to a warmer climate are identified as the most plausible drivers explaining the observed turnover in species composition. On Jan Mayen Island, similar changes in vegetation were found during time periods of 19 and 80 years. Over both time-scales, graminoid and woody species were found to have increased, whereas several snow-bed related species have decreased. However, whereas the main trend is similar over both time-scales considered, discrepancies in the trends of some species suggest that long-term changes are only partly predictable from short-term studies. The results of the meta-analysis show that the arrangement between species has changed more than is expected by chance, indicating that nonrandom changes have occurred in the studied arctic, alpine, and mire habitats during the past century. Vegetation stability was found to vary sitespecifically. Observed patterns could not be explained by different factors, such as time-scale, plot number, species diversity, or productivity. The thesis shows that non-random vegetational changes have occurred independent of which habitat or site is considered. As the observed changes in vegetation are in line with several other studies on vegetational dynamics focusing at different temporal and spatial scales and using permanent plots, this thesis demonstrates that historical phytosociological data-sets may successfully be used in the way presented here. These results unlock a valuable archive to identify recent vegetational changes in relation to environmental change. Moreover, observations of increased growth of woody plants and graminoids, upward shifts in species ranges, and decreases in species mostly associated with wetter habitats indicate trends in vegetation towards more competitive and nutrient-demanding species. With regard to predicted changes in climate, further changes may be assumed, the effects of which are likely to be most pronounced in areas where species are adapted to low temperatures and low nutrient availability, such as in high mountain areas, raised bogs, and in the Arctic...|$|E
