40|$|The {{production}} of biodiesel from vegetable oils {{is not a}} new technology; it has been around since the 1950 ’s and both the research in terms of the different feedstock that can be used and the {{production of}} biodiesel has since been gaining momentum as {{there needs to be a}} new, sustainable and domestic alternative to petroleum fuels. These petroleum fuels pose enormous threats to the environment and therefore need to be replaced as they are mostly contributing to climate change and global warming not to mention the frequent price hikes which are crippling the South African economy. Biodiesel production using vegetable oils seems to be and is the future and a law has recently been passed which sanctions the production of biofuel locally. [1] South African fuel producers will instigate <b>obligatory</b> <b>blending</b> of fossil fuel with biofuel as the country moves to encourage investment in its biofuels sector. The production of biodiesel locally and the blending of biodiesel with other petroleum products will reduce the country’s dependence on imported fuel. The already established petrochemical companies like BP, Sasol and Engine are therefore mandated to purchase these biofuels if and when the biofuels meet the required South African National Standard (SANS) 1935 requirements. This is then where the challenge comes as most of these growing biofuel companies cannot afford to purchase testing equipment. The growing companiesthen discover upon completion of the biofuel manufacturing process that their product does not meet the required standard specification. The failure translates to a financial loss as the final product can possibly not be reworked. The aim of the project is then to assist these companies who are manufacturing biofuel, by providing them with in-house biofuel process methods which will allow for early detection, should there be a need to redo a step in the process and not wait until the completion of the production process. These in-house process-testing methods will range from pH determination, titration tests which will determine the soap content and the percentage free fatty acid content, water determination, density and visual testing. It is not cost-effective for these biodiesel manufacturers to send their samples for outsource testing as evidently the results obtained would be out of specification hence the need to provide these biodiesel manufacturers with in-house analytical testing techniques that will aid in monitoring of the biodiesel production...|$|E
40|$|Biofuels {{worldwide}} recorded considerable {{growth rates}} {{over the last}} years, making them {{one of the most}} flourishing young industries. The biofuels industry within the EU 27 focused on the production of biodiesel, which is the equivalent of the regular fossil diesel. Main drivers, which led to this development, were a favorable legislative framework promoted by the EU, which was translated by each EU member state through excise tax exemptions and <b>obligatory</b> fuel <b>blending</b> levels, and higher production levels of oilseeds, the main raw material for biofuel production. Based on the favorable context within the EU and its agricultural potential Romania could increase both its internal consumption of biodiesel and become a net exporter of biofuel to other EU countries. A thorough analysis of the current market conditions in the European and Romanian economy, and in the biofuel market specifically, is a requirement for the long term sustainability of Romanian investments in biofuels. This study aims at providing a basis for identifying the risk factors, faced by investment projects in Romanian biofuels, using the PESTEL analysis tool. biofuels, biodiesel, sustainable biodiesel production, PESTEL...|$|R
