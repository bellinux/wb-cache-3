40|$|Background: A world {{divided by}} health inequalities poses ethical {{challenges}} for global health. International and national responses to health disparities must {{be rooted in}} ethical values about health and its distribution; this is because ethical claims {{have the power to}} motivate, delineate principles, duties and responsibilities, and hold global and national actors morally responsible for achieving common goals. Theories of justice are necessary to define duties and <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>institutions</b> and actors in reducing inequalities. The problem is the lack of a moral framework for solving problems of global health justice. Aim: To study why global health inequalities are morally troubling, why efforts to reduce them are morally justified, how they should be measured and evaluated; how much priority disadvantaged groups should receive; and to delineate roles and responsibilities of national and international actors and institutions. Discussion and conclusions: Duties and obligations of international and state actors in reducing global health inequalities are outlined. The ethical principles endorsed include the intrinsic value of health to well-being and equal respect for all human life, the importance of health for individual and collective agency, the concept of a shortfall from the health status of a reference group, and the need for a disproportionate effort to help disadvantaged groups. This approach does not seek to find ways in which global and national actors address global health inequalities by virtue of their self-interest, national interest, collective security or humanitaria...|$|E

However, views diverge wildly {{from that point on}} regarding how to define education, how to define democracy, and how the one has an obligation to inform, shape, and interact with the other. In the history of public education, the role schools play in a democracy is dynamic and progressive, continuously being amended or expanded to extend the rights of individuals or groups who were being systematically excluded from that education. Examples of these continual re-evaluations <b>of</b> the democratic <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> public education include Brown vs. the Board of Education, Title IX, and the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA). In all the these decisions, the democratic aims of equality of rights and opportunities for all individuals were codified in public education law— ensuring that schools must not discriminate or inhibit the rights of students regardless of their race, gender, or ability. Each of these decisions were certainly fraught with a tension that the role of public schools was not to extend “special rights ” to particula...|$|R
50|$|The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission {{reported}} in January 2011 that CDS {{contributed significantly to}} the crisis. Companies were able to sell protection to investors against the default of mortgage-backed securities, helping to launch and expand the market for new, complex instruments such as CDO's. This further fueled the housing bubble. They also amplified the losses from the collapse of the housing bubble by allowing multiple bets on the same securities and helped spread these bets throughout the financial system. Companies selling protection, such as AIG, were not required to set aside sufficient capital to cover their obligations when significant defaults occurred. Because many CDS were not traded on exchanges, the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> key financial <b>institutions</b> became hard to measure, creating uncertainty in the financial system.|$|R

40|$|During his {{thirty years}} as a {{professional}} writer, Joseph Conrad explored the difficult processes whereby individuals attempt to establish identity through participation in ethical communities. Recognizing the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>institutions</b> (politics, religion, marriage) to provide ethical guidance to a fragmented world, Conrad in his fiction, instead of extolling the virtues of successful communities, emphasized the dangers of intellectual and emotional isolation that inhibit their formation. ^ For Conrad, creation of useful communities depends on potential members being able to voice their needs and beliefs {{in such a way}} that others can understand and then contribute to the formation of an ethically acceptable group. Thus the concept of voice (literal, metaphoric, narrative) charts the success or failure of the various communities portrayed in the novels. ^ In Almayer 2 ̆ 7 s Folly and An Outcast of the Islands, his first two novels, Conrad dramatizes the conflicts that occur when individuals who are non-native members of exotic societies undertake to build new communities for purposes of self-gratification. In The Nigger of the 2 ̆ 2 Narcissus, 2 ̆ 2 he examines how a potentially successful community can be disrupted by individuals who refuse to alter their behaviour to fit the very needs that the community has been constituted to fulfill. ^ Embodying narrative consciousness in Marlow in 2 ̆ 2 Heart of Darkness 2 ̆ 2 and Lord Jim, Conrad dramatizes the ambiguous ethical position of an individual who attempts to justify a participation in one community by making reference to other communities. In his 2 ̆ 2 political novels 2 ̆ 2 [...] Nostromo, The Secret Agent, and Under Western Eyes [...] he examines how obsession to private values precludes an individual 2 ̆ 7 s active participation in ethical communities. During his final phase, Conrad reworks much of his material as romance. Relying on allegory and symbolism in Victory, the most successful of the later novels, he stresses the need for the individual to commit fully to community as the chief means of combating pervasive evil dramatized in the figures of Jones, Ricardo, and Pedro. ^ Throughout all these works, the message remains consistent. Those individuals who put the claims of self above those of ethical communities are doomed to fail. Although these individuals fail to achieve community, their need to verify the possibility of such communities is what makes them 2 ̆ 2 one of us. 2 ̆ 2...|$|R

Yet even in schools of public health, where service is purported to be an integral component of the institution's mission, faculty generally do not accord as high a value to service performance or approach it with {{the same degree of}} commitment as they do research and teaching. A study was conducted to examine faculty perceptions and attitudes toward the service function and its relationship to teaching and research within schools of public health. The data were taken from a mailed questionnaire survey of 20 - 30 faculty members in each of 20 schools of public health in the United States. The response rate was 71 percent, or 387 returned questionnaires. Respondents generally felt that the greatest value of service lies in its potential for enhancing the image and prestige of the school, and in the fulfillment <b>of</b> the community <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>institution.</b> The possibility that service might bring about improvements in faculty research and teaching, or improvements in health services and public health, was rated significantly lower. Thus, respondents did not view service as useful for its contribution to their own careers or to public health practice as much as they regarded it as a beneficial contribution to the reputation <b>of</b> the <b>institution.</b> This view undermines the traditionally held notion that public service either benefits a particular constituency outside the school or enhances the professional development of faculty members themselves...|$|R

40|$|In {{the years}} {{leading to the}} recent {{financial}} crisis, finance theorists introduced innovative methods, including quantitative financial models and derivative instruments, to measure and mitigate risk exposure. During the financial crisis, financial institutions facing insolvency revealed pervasive misunderstandings, misapplications, and mistaken assumptions regarding these complex risk management methods. As losses in financial markets escalated and caused liquidity and solvency crises, commentators sharply criticized directors and executives at large financial institutions for their risk management decisions. By adopting the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Congress directly and indirectly addresses certain risk management oversight concerns at large, complex financial institutions. To improve risk management oversight at these institutions, Congress imposed several structural reforms altering the composition and <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>institutions</b> 2 ̆ 7 boards of directors.

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the role that}} the Court of Justice has assumed — as evidenced by the approach taken in its case law — in relation to the Union’s external policy objectives. The starting point is an observation: the Court appears to be reticent (non-interventionist) if not deferential as regards the policy choices <b>of</b> the political <b>institutions</b> in external relations. It tends to take those choices at face value (basing itself on statements in legal instruments and policy documents); it does not question them, nor seek to define or shape them. More than this, it emphasises the need for the political institutions to retain their policy discretion, their room for manoeuvre. This is in contrast to its interventionist – if not activist – stance in relation to the definition of the scope of EU external competence and its implications for Member States, and its ‘gatekeeper’ — if not defensive — role in relation to the status of international law within in the EU legal system (roles which are explored in other contributions). The chapter seeks to establish a workable framework to understand this approach of the Court to EU external policy objectives by identifying some of the characteristics of those external objectives, and then placing the case law {{in the context of the}} Court’s approach to EU internal policy objectives and to institutional and competence-related issues in external relations. Its conclusion is that the Court, in the field of external relations, does not itself define the Union’s objectives, nor derive them from the Treaty. It accepts them as defined by the political institutions and then uses the jurisdiction it exercises over the respective competences and <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>institutions</b> and the Member States to enforce them...|$|R
