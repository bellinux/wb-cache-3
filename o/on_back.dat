5|$|The Danube {{crested newt}} or Danube newt (Triturus dobrogicus) is {{a species of}} newt found {{in central and eastern}} Europe, along the basin of the Danube river and some of its tributaries and in the Dnieper delta.

5|$|In {{accordance}} with the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, a set of regulations promulgated by NASA on July 16 to codify its quarantine protocol, the astronauts continued in quarantine out of concern that the Moon might contain undiscovered pathogens and that the astronauts might {{have been exposed to}} them during their Moon walks. However, after three weeks in confinement (first in the Apollo spacecraft, then in their trailer on the Hornet, and finally in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the Manned Spacecraft Center), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health. On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee <b>on</b> <b>Back</b> Contamination met in Atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts, on those who had joined them in quarantine (NASA physician William Carpentier and MQF project engineer John Hirasaki), and on Columbia itself. Loose equipment from the spacecraft would remain in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study.|$|E
5|$|The central Vishnu {{head and}} side heads of Varaha and Narasimha may be {{influenced}} by other configurations in architecture. For example, Vishnu, Varaha and Narasimha may be depicted <b>on</b> <b>back</b> (western) and side (northern/southern) walls of temples. Varaha (rescues the earth from the cosmic waters at the beginning of an eon), Vishnu (as a human) and Narasimha (destroying a demon) may represent creation, preservation and destruction - the three functions in the Hindu universe. Vaikuntha Chaturmurti represents Vishnu as the Supreme Being, Creator of the Universe. Also, Varaha and Narasimha are oldest in antiquity (avatars Matsya and Kurma which are described in sacred texts to be appearing before Varaha and Narasimha were associated with Vishnu at a later date). Their presence in the iconography of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti suggests that this form originated in the Gupta era, where their cults were at their peak.|$|E

5|$|Using a {{technique}} pioneered <b>on</b> <b>Back</b> to the Future Part II, another {{shot with a}} different lighting scheme was filmed. By combining separate key light and fill light passes, optical effects could generate any amount of contrast they wanted without causing spillage. Because Paramount continued to add new shots to the busy schedule and tight budget, some elements were flipped for reuse, including the star fields and {{a shot of the}} Bird of Prey firing. Whenever possible, the ships were filmed from below to reinforce the nautical theme, with their movements intended to remind the audience of galleons or other large seafaring vessels.|$|E

25|$|At {{the one to}} go signal, {{the pace}} car will turn its lights off. At this point, any car that is ahead of {{the leader of the}} race will be waved around {{to the rear of the}} field.

The leader of the race gets lane choice, but the third place car (and odd positions <b>on</b> <b>back)</b> will always start in the inside line, while the fourth place car (and even positions <b>on</b> <b>back)</b> will always start in the outside lane.

25|$|When the surfer is at wave speed, the surfer must quickly pop up, stay low, {{and stay}} {{toward the front}} of the wave to become stable and prevent falling as the wave steepens. The {{acceleration}} is less toward the front than toward the back. The physics behind the surfing of the wave involves the horizontal acceleration force (Fsinθ) and the vertical force (Fcosθ=mg). Therefore, the surfer should lean forward to gain more speed, and lean <b>on</b> <b>back</b> foot to brake. Also, to increase the length of the ride of the wave, the surfer should travel parallel to the wave crest.|$|E

After winning the toss, Australia <b>on</b> <b>back</b> of centuries from David Warner and Usman Khawaja and half centuries from Joe Burns and Adam Voges declared their innings at 4/556. New Zealand in reply had a steady start before a middle-order collapse left them struggling {{at the end of}} day 2. However, Kane Williamson's 140 meant that Australia didn't enforce the follow-on. However, Warner's second century and Burns maiden ton resulted in New Zealand being set a target of 504 runs. Another middle-order collapse meant that despite rain interruptions on day 3 and day 4 Australia comfortably won the Test by 208 runs.|$|E
25|$|In {{slippery}} conditions some riders {{prefer to}} ride fixed {{because they believe}} the transmission provides increased feedback <b>on</b> <b>back</b> tire grip. However, {{there is also an}} increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).|$|E
25|$|Textile {{production}} in Michoacan includes embroidery, back strap and foot-pedal loom weaving, and crochet. Weaving {{dates back to}} the pre Hispanic period, when cotton, ixtle and even feathers and rabbit were used to create cloth and other textiles. All weaving was done <b>on</b> <b>back</b> strap looms, and the relatively narrow cloth stitched together when wider pieces were need to items such as huipils and blankets. The Spanish brought sheep and wool was added alongside the native fibers. They also introduced the framed pedal loom, which allows the creation of wider, thicker and longer pieces. The arrival of the Spanish also introduced new designs, such as horses appearing in weavings. Textile work is still passed on from generation to generation in indigenous communities in the state and is an important source of income for these families.|$|E
