5|$|Officials {{recommended}} the citizens on Smith Island to evacuate {{on the day}} prior to the hurricane making landfall, the only evacuations for the Eastern shore of Maryland. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for low-lying and other specific areas in Calvert, St. Mary's, and Charles counties, and the residents in six homes were asked to leave in Howard County. Officials recommended residents in flood areas of Baltimore County to evacuate, and some {{in the city of}} Baltimore left spontaneously due to flooding. Evacuation rates were low throughout the Maryland coastline, with the highest rate being in the southernmost counties on the western shore. The primary reason for people staying was due to the track of the hurricane. Between 20% and 33% of those who participated in an evacuation survey said they had concerns about being caught on roadways while trying to evacuate as the storm arrived, with similar numbers expressing concern about being able {{to return to their homes}} if they evacuated. Of those who left, most went to the house of a friend <b>or</b> <b>family</b> <b>member,</b> with two-thirds to three-fourths going to destinations in their own neighborhood or county. Most did not evacuate until the day before or the day of landfall. In most areas, the public response to the evacuation orders was normal to fast, with traffic during the evacuation described as light to normal. The most significant problems experienced during the evacuation were downed trees, inadequate signage, flooded roads, or stalled cars. In all, 3,080people evacuated their homes in preparation for Hurricane Isabel. Boats, trucks, and school buses helped more than 1,000people evacuate the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, as well.|$|E

25|$|These {{individuals}} {{may be trying}} to reenact unresolved issues with their parents. A history of frequent illnesses may also {{contribute to the development of}} this disorder. In some cases, individuals afflicted with FD are accustomed to actually being sick, and thus return to their previous state to recapture what they once considered the 'norm.' Another cause is a history of close contact with someone (a friend <b>or</b> <b>family</b> <b>member)</b> who had a severe or chronic condition. The patients found themselves subconsciously envious of the attention said relation received, and felt that they themselves faded into the background.

Most cases involve a Japanese mother taking her children to Japan in defiance of visitation or joint custody orders issued by Western courts. The issue is a growing problem as the number of international marriages increases. Barring exceptional circumstances, the effects of {{child abduction}} are generally detrimental to the welfare of children. Parental abduction often has a particularly devastating effect on parents who may never see their children again.|$|E
25|$|Scotland {{conforms}} to the Human Tissue Authority Code of Practice, which grants authority to donate organs, instead of consent of the individual. This helps to avoid conflict of implications and contains several requirements. In order to participate in organ donation, one must be listed on the Organ Donor Registry (ODR). If the subject is incapable of providing consent, and {{is not on the}} ODR, then an acting representative, such as a legal guardian <b>or</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> can give legal consent for organ donation of the subject, along with a presiding witness, according to the Human Tissue Authority Code of Practice. Consent or refusal from a spouse, family member, or relative is necessary for a subject is incapable.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the start}} of the Web site, many have {{acknowledged}} the importance of such an organization. The Doe Network lists 74 successful identity resolutions assisted by its volunteers; 36 occurred within {{the first five years of}} the group's formation. Resolved cases include Deanna Criswell, found in 1987 and identified in 2015, Samantha Bonnell, and Dorothy Gay Howard, found in 1954 and identified in 2009. Criswell was identified after family members came upon the case file of the unidentified teen and later submitted a possible connection between the two. Samantha Bonnell's mother recognized a reconstruction created by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children on the file of her daughter. Various other cases have been solved in a similar way, often when loved ones or those investigating the disappearance of a missing individual discover a case file on the website that details a case similar to their missing companion <b>or</b> <b>family</b> <b>member.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Blood {{donations}} {{are divided}} into groups based on who will receive the collected blood. [...] An 'allogeneic' (also called 'homologous') donation is when a donor gives blood for storage at a blood bank for transfusion to an unknown recipient. [...] A 'directed' donation is when a person, often a family member, donates blood for transfusion to a specific individual. [...] Directed donations are relatively rare when an established supply exists. [...] A 'replacement donor' donation is a hybrid of the two and is common in developing countries such as Ghana. [...] In this case, a friend <b>or</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> of the recipient donates blood to replace the stored blood used in a transfusion, ensuring a consistent supply. [...] When a person has blood stored that will be transfused back to the donor at a later date, usually after surgery, that is called an 'autologous' donation. [...] Blood {{that is used to}} make medications can be made from allogeneic donations or from donations exclusively used for manufacturing.|$|E

2500|$|The UNICEF report {{noted that}} Israel {{had made some}} {{positive}} changes over recent years, such as hand tying measures that do not cause pain or injury. It urged Israel to refrain from blindfolding minors and holding them in solitary confinement, to permit an attorney <b>or</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> to attend interrogations, and to record interrogations to document any false claims of abuse. Israel's Foreign Ministry said Israel's military was already making changes {{to cooperate with the}} United Nations, including reducing holding time before seeing a judge to 48 hours, telling parents about arrest of children, and informing children of their right to consult a lawyer. UNICEF replied that the changes were insufficiently specific. Israeli Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor stated that [...] "Israel will study the conclusions and will work to implement them through ongoing cooperation with UNICEF, whose work we value and respect". In October,2013 UNICEF reported that the IDF was introducing changes in its arrest of minors in a pilot-test programme, but according to Haaretz the policy had not at that date been implemented and was still under study.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{international}} {{child abduction}} is generally synonymous with international parental kidnapping, child snatching, and child stealing. [...] However, the more precise legal usage of {{international child abduction}} originates in private international law and refers to the illegal removal of children from their home by an acquaintance <b>or</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> to a foreign country. In this context, [...] "illegal" [...] is normally taken to mean [...] "in breach of custodial rights" [...] and [...] "home" [...] {{is defined as the}} child's habitual residence. As implied by the [...] "breach of custodial rights," [...] the phenomenon of international child abduction generally involves an illegal removal that creates a jurisdictional conflict of laws whereby multiple authorities and jurisdictions could conceivably arrive at seemingly reasonable and conflicting custodial decisions with geographically limited application. Such a result often strongly affects a child's access and connection to half their family and may cause the loss of their former language, culture, name and nationality, it violates numerous children's rights, and can cause severe psychological and emotional trauma to the child and family left behind.|$|E
