5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, stiffness and damping. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements {{are used in the}} body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed <b>of</b> <b>ideal</b> components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{factorization}} of Euclidean domains {{is useful}} in many applications. For example, the unique factorization of the Gaussian integers is convenient in deriving formulae for all Pythagorean triples and in proving Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares.

Although this approach succeeds for some values of n (such as n=3, the Eisenstein integers), in general such numbers do not factor uniquely. This failure of unique factorization in some cyclotomic fields led Ernst Kummer to the concept <b>of</b> <b>ideal</b> numbers and, later, Richard Dedekind to ideals.|$|E

40|$|Points 3. 6 is a {{software}} package for symbolic computations on points {{developed in the}} framework of Project Points (started in 1999) aimed at creating and implementing novel algorithms to solve problems in Algebraic Geometry. The Points software includes packages for the computation of the Hilbert function and of minimal generators <b>of</b> the <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> a finite set of points (the points can be also fat) or of rational varieties or of elliptic curves over finite fields of type Z_p. The release Points 3. 6 (2004) extends the application of the above packages, except that for elliptic curves, to the field Q of rational numbers. All the algorithms implemented in Points have polynomial computational cost and are programmed in the object-oriented language C++. The features are: - 1 - Computations on zero-dimensional schemes: simple points: - 1. 1 - Hilbert function <b>of</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> projective points. - 1. 2 - Minimal generators <b>of</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> projective points. - 1. 3 - Conductor of projective points. - 1. 4 - Checking the Ideal Generation Conjecture (on Z_p). fat points: - 1. 5 - Hilbert function <b>of</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> fat projective points. - 1. 6 - Hilbert function <b>of</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> the projective closure of affine fat points. - 1. 7 - Minimal generators <b>of</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> fat projective points. - 1. 8 - Maximal rank and minimally generation <b>of</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> fat points. - 2 - Minimal generators <b>of</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> parametric rational curves. - 3 - Minimal generators <b>of</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> parametric varieties up to a given degree. - 4 - Hilbert function and minimal generators <b>of</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> elliptic curves computed as birational images of plane elliptic curves (only on Z_p).

25|$|As {{discussed}} earlier, momentary attractions (or repulsions) between particles have {{an effect}} on gas dynamics. In physical chemistry, the name given to these intermolecular forces is van der Waals force. These forces {{play a key role in}} determining physical properties of a gas such as viscosity and flow rate (see physical characteristics section). Ignoring these forces in certain conditions (see Kinetic-molecular theory) allows a real gas to be treated like an ideal gas. This assumption allows the use <b>of</b> <b>ideal</b> gas laws which greatly simplifies calculations.|$|E
25|$|At {{locations}} {{inside the}} charge array, to connect {{an array of}} paired charges to an approximation involving only a dipole moment density p(r) requires additional considerations. The simplest approximation is to replace the charge array with a model <b>of</b> <b>ideal</b> (infinitesimally spaced) dipoles. In particular, as in the example above that uses a constant dipole moment density confined to a finite region, a surface charge and depolarization field results. A more general version of this model (which allows the polarization to vary with position) is the customary approach using electric susceptibility or electrical permittivity.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{irreversible}} processes {{that result in}} an increase of the entropy. See: Entropy production.

The mixing is accompanied by the entropy of mixing. In the important case of mixing <b>of</b> <b>ideal</b> gases, the combined system does not change its internal energy by work or heat transfer; the entropy increase is then entirely due to the spreading of the different substances into their new common volume.|$|E
