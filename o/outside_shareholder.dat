40|$|This {{empirical}} paper {{investigates the}} relationship between the corporate governance structure of the firm and the probability of voluntary accounting changes in the Netherlands during the period 1990 - 1998. The paper reports the results of a sample of 194 voluntary accounting changes. The empirical results show that the presence of large <b>outside</b> <b>shareholders</b> significantly decreases the probability of voluntary accounting changes that {{have a positive effect on}} reported net income. This result supports the monitoring hypothesis, which indicates that large <b>outside</b> <b>shareholders</b> will monitor voluntary accounting changes more effectively than small shareholders, and will restrict the opportunistic behaviour of managers bent on increasing reported net income. We find that management shareholdings decrease the probability of voluntary accounting changes. These findings are consistent with the alignment hypothesis, which suggests that managers who hold a stake in the firm will be more aligned with <b>outside</b> <b>shareholders.</b> Agency problems may be reduced through management shareholdings. We find no support for the monitoring role of outside members of the supervisory board. Finally, our results show that firm size affects the probability of negative accounting changes, which may support the political cost hypothesis. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004. ...|$|R

This imposes a credibility constraint on firm size, providing a rationale for the shape of long-run cost curves. Given this limit on outside funds, th...|$|R

5000|$|After Third Point {{disclosed}} its {{stake in}} Yahoo on September 8, 2011, {{calling for the}} resignations of four directors, Yahoo set up {{a conference call with}} Loeb, Jerry Yang of Yahoo, and one of the directors in question, Roy Bostock. Loeb said that the conversation concluded with “Mr. Bostock’s abrupt unilateral termination of the call”. Bostock, however, claimed that he had “said that he had other shareholders to attend to and ended the phone call”. Loeb informed Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson in a March 2012 letter that Third Point wanted four seats on the firm's board. At the time Third Point owned about 5.3% of the firm. Yahoo sought to compromise by accepting one of Loeb's board nominees, Harry Wilson, a restructuring specialist, plus “another candidate acceptable to the two sides”, but Loeb insisted on being added himself to the board. Yahoo refused, telling Loeb, according to his own account, that “my experience and knowledge 'would not be additive to the Board' and that as Yahoo's largest <b>outside</b> <b>shareholder,</b> I would be 'conflicted' as a Director. ... Only in an illogical Alice-in-Wonderland world would a shareholder be deemed to be conflicted from representing the interests of other shareholders because he is, well, a shareholder too.” Loeb charged that the “Board's evaluation of our candidates” made “a mockery of good principles of corporate governance”. In response to Yahoo's charge that Third Point was a “short-term investor”, Loeb responded that “this 'long-term vs. short-term' excuse is a canard and particularly inapt in the case of Yahoo. If there ever was a company in need of a sense of urgency, it is this one”. Loeb added that the “real issue is not short-term versus long-term but about Board representatives who have skin in the game and will exercise sound business judgment”.|$|E

40|$|We {{simultaneously}} analyze two {{mechanisms of}} the managerial labor market: CEO turnover and monetary remuneration schemes. Sample selection models and hazard analyses {{applied to a}} random sample of 250 firms listed on the London Stock Exchange over a six-year pre-Cadbury period show that managerial remuneration and the termination of labor contracts {{play an important role in}} mitigating agency problems between managers and shareholders. We find that both the CEO's industry-adjusted monetary compensation and their replacement are strongly performance-sensitive. Top executive turnover is shown to serve as a disciplinary mechanism for corporate underperformance, whereas the level of monetary compensation rewards good performance. We also investigate whether specific corporate governance mechanisms (different types of blockholders or of boards of directors) have an impact on managerial disciplining or on the pay-for-performance contracts. There is little evidence of <b>outside</b> <b>shareholder</b> monitoring and CEOs with strong voting power successfully resisting replacement irrespective of corporate performance. This case of strong managerial entrenchment is even exacerbated when the CEO also holds the position of chairman of the board. In firms with large outside shareholdings, CEO compensation is lower, but <b>outside</b> <b>shareholder</b> do not impose a stricter performance-related incentive remuneration scheme. When insiders have strong voting power, the CEOs remuneration is lower except when the stock price performance is poor: it seems that when the CEOs wealth resulting from their investment goes down due to decreasing stock prices, the CEOs cash compensation is higher. The presence of a remuneration committee has no impact on remuneration. Finally, we find strong support for the incentive effect-hypothesis of remuneration: CEOs with higher levels of monetary compensation attain better subsequent accounting and stock price-based measures of corporate performance. ...|$|E

This study investigates how insider ownership affects this relation. We show that when insider ownership is high, returns decline for low P/E firms and improve for high P/E firms. These findings are rationalized in the context of entrenchment and alignment of incentive effects.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{characteristics}} of 73 UK companies in which managers have an ownership stake of greater than 50 per cent. We find that majority owner-managed companies make less use of alternative corporate control systems and {{are less likely to}} remove their chief executive officer or other board members following poor performance. However, our sample firms actually outperform diffusely held companies of similar size in the same industry. The determinants of majority control appear more closely related to {{the characteristics of}} the controlling shareholders rather than the firm's operating environment. Changes in the ownership structure of our sample companies owe more to changes in owner-specific characteristics and security issuance than they are related to changes in the company's operating environment or company performance.

40|$|We study an {{industry}} with a monopolistic bottleneck (e. g. a transmission network) supplying an essential input to several downstream firms.

Access prices are regulated but the upstream firm can perform non-tariff discrimination. Under perfect legal unbundling the upstream firm maximizes only own profits; with imperfections it considers to some extend also the profits of its downstream mother. We find that reducing imperfections in legal unbundling (keeping ownership fixed) generally increases total output. Increasing the incumbent's ownership share increases total output if imperfections are sufficiently small, otherwise the effects are ambiguous. Surprisingly, higher ownership shares of the downstream incumbent may sometimes lead to lower degrees of imperfections.

The motivation behind {{this study is the}} implicit assertion by the SEC, the NYSE and the NASDAQ that earnings management and poor corporate governance mechanisms are positively related.

Specifically, a significant relation is found only when the audit committee has less than a majority of independent directors. Surprisingly, and in contrast to the new regulations, no significant association is found between earnings management and the more stringent requirement of 100 % audit committee independence. Empirical evidence also is provided that other corporate governance characteristics are related to earnings management. Earnings management is positively related to whether the CEO sits on the board's compensation committee. It is negatively related to the CEO's shareholdings and to whether a large <b>outside</b> <b>shareholder</b> sits on the board's audit committee.
