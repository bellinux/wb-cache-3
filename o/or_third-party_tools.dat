IT administrators and software developers administer them through offline operations using built-in <b>or</b> <b>third-party</b> <b>tools.</b> In terms of naming, a hard disk image for a certain Virtual Machine monitor has a specific file type extension, e.g., [...]vmdk for VMware VMDK, [...]vhd for Xen and Microsoft Hyper-V, [...]vdi for Oracle VM VirtualBox, etc..|$|E
50|$|Outlook add-ins {{are small}} helping {{programs}} for the Microsoft Outlook application. The main purpose of the add-ins is to add new functional capabilities into Microsoft Outlook and automate some routine operations. The term also refers to programs where the main function is to work on Outlook files, such as synchronization or backup utilities. Outlook add-ins may be developed in Microsoft Visual Studio <b>or</b> <b>third-party</b> <b>tools</b> such as Add-in Express. Outlook add-ins are not supported in Outlook Web App.|$|E

50|$|In most {{computer}} drives, {{users are}} allowed to change the region code up to five times.

Resetting the firmware count can be done with first- <b>or</b> <b>third-party</b> software <b>tools,</b> <b>or</b> by reflashing (see above) to RPC-1 firmware.|$|R
50|$|Other devices like {{programmable}} calculators {{may also}} have glue languages; the operating systems of PDAs such as Windows CE may have available native <b>or</b> <b>third-party</b> macro <b>tools</b> that glue applications together, in addition to implementations of common glue languages—including Windows NT, MS-DOS and some Unix shells, Rexx, Modern Pascal, PHP, and Perl. Depending upon the OS version, WSH and the default script engines (VBScript and JScript) are available.|$|R
50|$|Each CICS {{program is}} {{initiated}} using a transaction identifier. CICS screens are usually sent as a construct called a map, a module created with Basic Mapping Support (BMS) assembler macros <b>or</b> <b>third-party</b> <b>tools.</b> CICS screens may contain text that is highlighted, has different colors, and/or blinks {{depending on the}} terminal type used. An example of how a map can be sent through COBOL is given below. The end user inputs data, which is made accessible to the program by receiving a map from CICS.|$|E
50|$|A music ringtone feature was {{introduced}} in the United States on September 5, 2007. Users can create custom ringtones from songs purchased from the iTunes Store for a small additional fee. The ringtones can be 3 to 30 seconds long from any part of a song, can fade in and out, pause from half a second to five seconds when looped, or loop continuously. All customizing can be done in iTunes, or with Apple's GarageBand software 4.1.1 or later (available only on Mac OS X) <b>or</b> <b>third-party</b> <b>tools.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Unlike their {{competitors}} in the online auction space, Bidtopia required that new bidders verify their identity and ability to pay with a [...]99 cent sign up fee. Initially {{there was only one}} seller, Bidtopia itself, but later the marketplace was expanded to include other sellers with online auction experience. Sellers could not sign up and shortly thereafter start creating auctions, but instead had to be individually approved by Bidtopia's management, a requirement meant to help curb problems related to fraud and the sale of stolen goods. Bidtopia had no means for sellers to directly create auctions via its website, instead requiring that such sellers use either software of their own creation <b>or</b> <b>third-party</b> <b>tools</b> designed to interact with the application programming interface for Bidtopia's auction software.|$|E
5000|$|Puppy Linux's package manager, Puppy Package Manager, {{installs}} packages in PET (Puppy Enhanced Tarball) format {{by default}} {{but it also}} accepts packages from other distros (such as [...]deb, [...]rpm, [...]txz, and [...]tgz packages) <b>or</b> by using <b>third-party</b> <b>tools</b> to convert packages from other distros to PET packages. Puppy Package Manager can also trim the software bloat of a package to reduce the disk space used.|$|R
50|$|Prior to Winzapper's creation, Administrators {{already had}} the ability to clear the Security log either through the Event Viewer <b>or</b> through <b>third-party</b> <b>tools</b> such as Clearlogs. However, Windows lacked any {{built-in}} method of selectively deleting events from the Security Log. An unexpected clearing of the log would likely be a red flag to system administrators that an intrusion had occurred. Winzapper would allow a hacker to hide the intrusion by deleting only those log events relevant to the attack. Winzapper, as publicly released, lacked the ability to be run remotely without the use of a tool such as Terminal Services. However, according to Arne Vidstrom, it could easily be modified for remote operation.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{consequence}} of the data-object soup is that objects can extend built-in applications such as the address book so seamlessly that Newton users can sometimes not distinguish which program or add-on object {{is responsible for the}} various features on their own system, because the advanced nature of Newton devices makes it easy to accept such add-ons. A user rebuilding their system after extended usage might find themselves unable to manually restore their system to the same functionality because some long-forgotten downloaded extension was missing. Data owned and used by applications and extensions themselves is tossed in the [...] "Storage" [...] area of the [...] "Extras" [...] drawer in 2.x Newton devices; on 1.x systems, they can only be found or removed in the Memory section of the built-in Prefs application, in the Card slip (also built-in), <b>or</b> with <b>third-party</b> <b>tools</b> such as NewtCase. There is no built-in distinction between types of data in that area. For example, an installed application's icon could be sitting right next to a database of addresses used by another installed extension further down the list.|$|R
50|$|The first playable {{prototype}} of Dreamfall Chapters had been produced concurrently with the ongoing Kickstarter campaign {{and was used}} to record in-game footage to attract additional funding. Adoption of a cost-saving third-party engine, Unity 4, has enabled the developers to iterate much faster on Chapters than on the original Dreamfall, which took six months to produce a prototype. Furthermore, RTG set out to minimize the in-house development costs, producing only a few key game systems (conversations, story flags, decision points, the social feature) and otherwise relying on either the native Unity technology (animation, physics), assets from the Asset Store (foliage, model libraries, shaders, full-screen filters, etc.), <b>or</b> <b>third-party</b> <b>tools</b> (Playmaker, NGUI, Daikon Forge). The resources saved this way were instead invested into the game content, such as levels, character designs, and special effects. Among the biggest challenges faced by the developers was the GUI and control scheme (a pure point-and-click interface was implemented early on but scrapped after the testers found it impractical) and the pathfinding AI for the NPCs.|$|E
40|$|Evaluation of {{hardware}} Intellectual Property (IP) cores {{is an important}} step in an IP-based system-on-chip (SoC) design flow. From the perspective of both IP vendors and Integrated Circuit (IC) designers, it is desirable that hardware IPs can be freely evaluated before purchase, similar to their software counterparts. However, protection of these IPs against piracy during evaluation is a major concern for the IP vendors. Existing solutions typically use encryption and vendor-specific toolsets, which may be unacceptable due to lack of flexibility to use in-house <b>or</b> <b>third-party</b> design <b>tools.</b> We propose a novel low-cost solution for hardware IP protection during evaluation, by embedding a hardware Trojan inside an IP {{in the form of a}} finite state machine (FSM) with special structure. The Trojan disrupts the normal functional behavior of the IP on occurrence of a sequence of rare events, thereby effectively putting an “expiry date ” on the usage of the IP. The Trojan is structurally and functionally obfuscated, thus protecting against potential reverse engineering efforts that target isolation of the Trojan circuit...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} Exoplanet Simple Orbit Fitting Toolbox (ExoSOFT), a new, {{open-source}} suite {{to fit the}} orbital elements of planetary or stellar mass companions to any combination of radial velocity and astrometric data. To explore the parameter space of Keplerian models, ExoSOFT may be operated with its own multi-stage sampling approach, <b>or</b> interfaced with <b>third-party</b> <b>tools</b> such as emcee. In addition, ExoSOFT is packaged {{with a collection of}} post-processing tools to analyze and summarize the results. Although only a few systems have been observed with both the radial velocity and direct imaging techniques, this number will increase thanks to upcoming spacecraft and ground based surveys. Providing both forms of data enables simultaneous fitting that can help break degeneracies in the orbital elements that arise when only one data type is available. The dynamical mass estimates this approach can produce are important when investigating the formation mechanisms and subsequent evolution of substellar companions. ExoSOFT was verified through fitting to artificial data and was implemented using the Python and Cython programming languages; available for public download at [URL] under the GNU General Public License v 3.
