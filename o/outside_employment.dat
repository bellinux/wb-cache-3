5|$|The First Lady of the United States is {{the hostess}} of the White House. The {{position}} is traditionally filled by {{the wife of}} the President of the United States, but, on occasion, the title has been applied to women who were not presidents’ wives, such as when the president was a bachelor or widower, or when {{the wife of the}} president was unable to fulfill the duties of the First Lady herself. The First Lady is not an elected position; it carries no official duties and receives no salary. Nonetheless, she attends many official ceremonies and functions of state either along with or in place of the president. Traditionally, the First Lady does not hold <b>outside</b> <b>employment</b> while occupying the office. She has her own staff, including the White House Social Secretary, the Chief of Staff, the Press Secretary, the Chief Floral Designer, and the Executive Chef. The Office of the First Lady is also in charge of all social and ceremonial events of the White House, and is a branch of the Executive Office of the President.|$|E

40|$|The Agreements on Work Performed <b>Outside</b> of <b>Employment</b> The aim of {{my thesis}} was to {{summarize}} the current and former legislation of legal relations established by the Agreements on Work Performed <b>Outside</b> of <b>Employment.</b> I focused my work on private law legislation, especially on the area of labour law and also on the public law legislation, such as social security law and tax law. By using the analytical method of research of the above mentioned, I concluded {{to what extent is}} such institute still needed and what possible changes shall the legislator consider to reflect the best the current needs of the society. To examine the legal situation, it was necessary {{to summarize the}} relationship between civil and labour law and also to define certain terms closely related to the institute of Agreements on Work Performed <b>Outside</b> of <b>Employment</b> in the first and second part of my thesis. Such terms include especially the notion of dependent labour and dependent activity as well as the notion of employment itself.

25|$|In August 2015, it was {{reported}} that Clinton had personally paid a State Department staffer, Bryan Pagliano, who had previously served as IT director for Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, to maintain her private server while she was Secretary of State. According to a Clinton campaign official, this ensured that taxpayer dollars would not be spent on a private server that was shared by Clinton, her husband and their daughter, as well as several aides to the former president. On September 1, 2015, Pagliano's attorney sent letters to the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which had subpoenaed Pagliano, and to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was inquiring about Pagliano's <b>outside</b> <b>employment</b> while a Federal employee, informing the committees that his client would invoke his constitutional Fifth Amendment rights not to answer any questions from the committees, and on September 10, in a closed-door session before the Benghazi Committee, Pagliano personally appeared to invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to testify before the committee.|$|E
500|$|Although Welty's {{departure}} from office on March 4, 1921, began {{a lull in}} criticism of Landis, in April, the judge made a controversial decision {{in the case of}} Francis J. Carey, a 19-year-old bank teller, who had pleaded guilty to embezzling $96,500. Carey, the sole support of his widowed mother and unmarried sisters, gained Landis's sympathy. He accused the bank of underpaying Carey, and sent the youth home with his mother. Two members of the Senate objected to Landis's actions, and the New York Post compared Carey with Les Misérables's Jean Valjean, noting [...] "etween a loaf of bread [...] and $96,500 there is a difference." [...] A bill barring <b>outside</b> <b>employment</b> by federal judges had been introduced by Landis's foes, but had expired {{with the end of the}} congressional session in March; his opponents tried again in July, and the bill failed in the Senate on a tie vote. On September 1, 1921, the American Bar Association, a trade group of lawyers, passed a resolution of censure against Landis.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{child labour}} can be {{misleading}} when it confuses harmful work with employment that may be beneficial to children. It can also ignore harmful work <b>outside</b> <b>employment</b> and any benefits children normally derive from their work. [...] Domestic work is an example: all families but the rich must work at cleaning, cooking, caring, and more to maintain their homes. In most families in the world, this process extends to productive activities, especially herding and various types of agriculture, [...] and {{to a variety of}} small family businesses. Where trading is a significant feature of social life, children can start trading in small items at an early age, often in the company of family members or of peers.|$|E

2500|$|Feminist {{writers of}} that period, such as Alva Myrdal and Viola Klein, started {{to allow for}} the {{possibility}} that women should be able to combine home with <b>outside</b> <b>employment.</b> 1950s’ form of feminism is often derogatorily termed “welfare feminism.” Indeed, many activists went to great length to stress that their position was that of ‘reasonable modern feminism,’ which accepted sexual diversity, and sought to establish what women’s social contribution was rather than emphasizing equality or the similarity of the sexes. Feminism in 1950s England was strongly connected to social responsibility and involved the well-being of society as a whole. This often came at the cost of the liberation and personal fulfillment of self-declared feminists. Even those women who regarded themselves as feminists strongly endorsed prevailing ideas about the primacy of children’s needs, as advocated, for example, by John Bowlby the head of the Children's Department at the Tavistock Clinic, who [...] published extensively throughout the 1950s and by Donald Winnicott who promoted through radio broadcasts and in the press the idea of the home as a private emotional world in which mother and child are bound to each other and in which the mother has control and finds freedom to fulfill herself.|$|E

40|$|Resumé / Summary Title: Agreements on work {{performed}} <b>outside</b> an <b>employment</b> relationship Agreements on {{work performed}} <b>outside</b> an <b>employment</b> relationship are {{a specific type}} of labour relationship allowing the employer to employ an employee {{on the basis of its}} actual needs. These agreements are unique in whole Europe; we may find them only in the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic, which is caused by the common development until the first half of 1990 's. There are two kinds of these agreements on work performed <b>outside</b> an <b>employment</b> relationship - Agreement on work performance and Agreement on working activity. Agreement on work performance may be considered as the smaller one and agreement on working activity as the bigger one. The main differences between them are the scope of work which may be performed under each of it and participation in the social security system and the health insurance system. An employee working on the basis of the agreement on work performance may work in the scope of work up to 150 hours in one calendar year. The agreement on work performance does not establish participation in the social security system and the health insurance system which means that this type of agreement is suitable mostly for a one bout activity. On the other hand the agreement on working activity enables to [...] ...|$|R
