The analytical {{results of the}} equations have been obtained in terms of convergent series with easily computable components. The algorithm is quite efficient and is practically well suited for these problems. Several examples are given to illustrate the reliability and implementation <b>of</b> the <b>iterative</b> method. <b>Comparisons</b> are made to confirm {{the accuracy of the}} technique.

40|$|Fig. 3 {{indicates}} that the computational cost <b>of</b> <b>iterative</b> GBF is significantly {{lower than those of}} greedy bit filling [3] and the algorithm in [2], particularly in cases of larger N and smaller b. For instance, when N = 512 and b = 6 is the case, R 1 varies from 88 % to 98 % along with η, whereas the value of R 2 is almost steadily 88 %. For given values of N and b, R 1 steadily increases along with η, whereas R 2 slightly decreases. These observations reveal the appealing merits <b>of</b> <b>iterative</b> GBF in <b>comparison</b> with earlier algorithms of O(N 2) complexity. Fig. 4 presents the improvement <b>of</b> <b>iterative</b> GBF compared with EBF in [1]. As can be seen, for each given pair of N and b, the corresponding curve of R 3 has a sawtooth shape. It {{is due to the fact}} that the number <b>of</b> <b>comparisons</b> saved by <b>iterative</b> GBF, i. e., d(N − 1), is proportional to d, which periodically varies from 0 to b − 1 along with η. Numerically, the improvement <b>of</b> <b>iterative</b> GBF can be significant when d is close to b − 1. For instance, R 3 can be up to 11 % and 9 % for scenarios of N = 128 and N = 512, respectively, when b = 10 is the case. It can be also observed that the improvement <b>of</b> <b>iterative</b> GBF is comparatively more significant in scenarios of smaller N and larger b. These observations confirm that the computational cost <b>of</b> <b>iterative</b> GBF is lower than that of EBF. Obviously, the same conclusions can be drawn for <b>iterative</b> GBR in <b>comparison</b> with greedy bit removal [5], the algorithm in [2], and EBR in [1]. VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS We have proposed r-GBF and r-GBR schemes for QAM-modulated OFDM systems, based on which a couple <b>of</b> <b>iterative</b> group-by-group bit-loading algorithms, i. e., iterative GBF and iterative GBR, are presented. In comparison with the original EBF and EBR in [1], the newly presented algorithms get rid of the dependence on conventional greedy algorithms thoroughly and converge to the optimal BAP with lower computational costs.

40|$|The genetic {{diversity}} observed among bacteriophages remains {{a major obstacle}} for the identification of homologs and the comparison of their functional modules. In the structural module, although several classes of homologous proteins contributing to the head and tail structure can be detected, proteins of the head-to-tail connection (or neck) are generally more divergent. Yet, molecular analyses of a few tailed phages belonging to different morphological classes suggested that {{only a limited number}} of structural solutions are used in order to produce a functional virion. To challenge this hypothesis and analyze proteins diversity at the virion neck, we developed a specific computational strategy to cope with sequence divergence in phage proteins. We searched for homologs of a set of proteins encoded in the structural module using a phage learning database. Results: We show that using a combination <b>of</b> <b>iterative</b> profile-profile <b>comparison</b> and gene context analyses, we can identify a set of head, neck and tail proteins in most tailed bacteriophages of our database. Classification of phages based on neck protein sequences delineates 4 Types corresponding to known morphological subfamilies. Further analysis of the most abundant Type 1 yields 10 Clusters characterized by consistent sets of head, neck and tail proteins. We developed Virfam, a webserver that automatically identifies proteins of the phage head-neck-tail module and assign phages to the most closely related cluster of phages. This server was tested against 624 new phages from the NCBI database. 93 % of the tailed and unclassified phages could be assigned to our head-neck-tail based categories, thus highlighting the large representativeness of the identified virion architectures. Types and Clusters delineate consistent subgroups of Caudovirales, which correlate with several virion properties. Conclusions: Our method and webserver have the capacity to automatically classify most tailed phages, detect their structural module, assign a function to a set of their head, neck and tail genes, provide their morphologic subtype and localize these phages within a "head-neck-tail" based classification. It should enable analysis of large sets of phage genomes. In particular, it should contribute to the classification of the abundant unknown viruses found on assembled contigs of metagenomic samples...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{notion of}} {{rational}} transduction {{is a valuable}} tool to compare the structures of different languages, in particular context-free languages. The explanation {{of this is a}} powerful property of rational transductions with respect to certain iterative pairs [8] and systems <b>of</b> <b>iterative</b> pairs (we define this notion in this paper), in a context-free language. (Intuitively, systems <b>of</b> <b>iterative</b> pairs describe combinations <b>of</b> simultaneous <b>iterative</b> pairs in a context-free language.) This property is the so-called Transfer Theorem, whose terms are:Let A and B be two context-free languages and let T be a rational transduction such that T(B) = A. If A has a strict system <b>of</b> <b>iterative</b> pairs σ, then B has a strict system <b>of</b> <b>iterative</b> pairs σ′, <b>of</b> the same type than σ. (This theorem has been proved in [8] for iterative pairs and we prove it here for systems <b>of</b> <b>iterative</b> pairs.) This theorem means that any combination <b>of</b> certain <b>iterative</b> pairs in the image language by a rational transduction must appear, in a similar way, in the source language. The main result of this paper is obtained by using the previous Transfer Theorem. This result is a characterization of context-free generators i. e. generators of the rational cone or, equivalently [10], of the full-AFL of context-free languages...|$|R
