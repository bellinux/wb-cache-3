5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> or inside of its host on or {{in which it}} is adapted to live. The life cycle of some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in brackish water marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first intermediate host is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E
5|$|Francis Bok {{was raised}} in a large Catholic family of cattle herders in the Dinka village of Gurion in Southern Sudan. His father, Bol Buk Dol, managed several herds of cattle, sheep and goats. When Bok was {{captured}} at the age of 7 on May 15, 1986, he could not count beyond 10 and knew very little <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world.|$|E
5|$|The Forest lies to the north-west of the Castle, and is feared by the Castle's {{inhabitants}} as a {{dark and}} dangerous area. The Wendron Witches and the witch community live there, as does Galen, Sarah Heap's mentor in Physik. The Forest has many mysterious aspects, and is dominated by shape-shifting or carnivorous trees, including Benjamin Heap, wolverines, and secrets. The Forest has a secret way to transport a character to the path leading to the House of Foryx. Sage based the Forest on medieval forests, which were huge and a law unto themselves, free from the authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world.|$|E

5|$|During the war, {{internal}} {{tensions and}} economic deprivation in Russia continued to mount and revolutionary sympathies grew. After Nicholas II was deposed in early 1917, {{many members of}} the Romanov dynasty, including Nicholas and his immediate family, were held under house arrest. The new government retired Kulikovsky from the army with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Dowager Empress Marie, Grand Duke Alexander, Grand Duchess Olga, and Kulikovsky managed to escape to the Crimea where they lived for a time before they too were placed under house arrest at one of the imperial estates. As a commoner, Kulikovsky was permitted more freedom of movement than the Romanovs, and was occasionally able to leave the estate in a pony-cart, which allowed him to run errands, obtain food, and seek news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b> On 12 August 1917, Olga and Kulikovsky's first child and son, Tikhon, was born in the Crimea. He was named after one of the Grand Duchess's favorite saints, Tikhon of Zadonsk. Although the grandson of an emperor and the nephew of another, Tikhon received no titles because his father was a commoner.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} a shot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> view of The Confidante hotel and two flamingos. In the next scene, and {{in the context of}} the track, Lipa is lying on a bed, {{thinking}} of giving her ex a second chance, while her friends are by her side. As the song continues, the artist heads towards the phone to answer his call, but is stopped by one of her friends. Then, she keeps receiving advice from the women, but manages to escape to the hallway. There, they perform a choreography, and return to the room. In the next scenes, the women start a sleepover, brushing each other's hair and applying lipstick on each other. They change their outfits and head towards the pool, where they walk over the water.|$|E
5|$|To {{insulate}} {{the sacred}} {{power in the}} sanctuary from the impurities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world, the Egyptians enclosed temple sanctuaries and greatly restricted access to them. People other than kings and high priests were thus denied contact with cult statues. The only exception was during festival processions, when the statue was carried out of the temple but still enclosed in a portable shrine. People did have less direct means of interaction. The more public parts of temples often incorporated small places for prayer, from doorways to freestanding chapels near {{the back of the}} temple building. Communities also built and managed small chapels for their own use, and some families had shrines inside their homes. Despite the gulf that separated humanity from the divine, the Egyptians were surrounded by opportunities to approach their gods.|$|E

5|$|Arha's {{routine is}} {{disrupted}} by her {{discovery of a}} man (Ged, the protagonist of A Wizard of Earthsea) in the undertomb. She traps him in the labyrinth by slamming the door on him, and through a peephole sees him unsuccessfully attempt {{to open the door}} with a spell. Trapped in the labyrinth the man collapses out of exhaustion, and Arha has him chained up while debating what to do with him. After questioning him she learns that he has come to the Tombs looking for the long-lost half of the ring of Erreth-Akbe, a magical talisman, broken centuries before, necessary for peace in Earthsea. The other half had come into his possession by chance, and a dragon told him of its true nature. Arha is drawn to him as he tells her <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world, and keeps him prisoner in the tombs, bringing him food and water. However, Kossil learns of Ged's existence, forcing Arha to promise that Ged will be sacrificed to the Nameless Ones; however, she realizes that she cannot go through with the sacrifice. She instructs Manan to dig a false grave underground, while she herself takes Ged to hide in the treasury of the Tombs.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{the church}} was {{sparingly}} furnished. The main nave was not vaulted but covered by a wooden ceiling, repeating in the middle the saddle-roof form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> roof. Both side naves had even ceilings, supported by columns with cubic capitals. The lofts opened through three wide arches into the main nave.|$|E

Following the transition to capitalism in 1992, Hoxha's legacy diminished, so that by the early 21st century very little of it was still in place in Albania.|$|E
