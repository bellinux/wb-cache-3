50|$|Since 1993, the Prince of Wales has voluntarily paid {{income tax}} on the duchy income less amounts which he {{considers}} to be <b>official</b> <b>expenditure.</b> The Prince paid a voluntary contribution to the treasury of 50% of his Duchy income {{from the time he}} became eligible for its full income at the age of 21 in 1969, and paid 25% from his marriage in 1981 until the current arrangement commenced in 1993. Tax is calculated after deducting <b>official</b> <b>expenditure,</b> the biggest source of which is the Prince's staff of about 110 who assist with his performance of official duties, including private secretaries and a valet working in his office at Clarence House and at Highgrove House. The <b>official</b> <b>expenditure</b> of the Prince of Wales is not audited by the National Audit Office.|$|R

The annuity is unaffected by the reform of royal finances under the Sovereign Grant Act 2011. Any part of the allowance that is not used to meet <b>official</b> <b>expenditure</b> is liable for tax. In practice, the entire allowance is used to fund his official duties.|$|R

Many of them however, received income from their positions within the administration, or from private practice or both. The fact that Michael Collins, in his ministerial capacity, kept all <b>official</b> <b>expenditure</b> under minute scrutiny ensured that any transactions involving Figgis were subject to particularly detailed monitoring by Finance officials.|$|R

50|$|Corruption in the PRC has {{developed}} in two major ways. In the first mode, corruption {{is in the}} form of ostensibly legal <b>official</b> <b>expenditure,</b> but is actually wasteful and directed toward private benefits. For example, the increasing number of local governments building massive administrative office buildings that resemble luxurious mansions. At the same time, many corrupt local officials have turned their jurisdictions into virtual “mafia states,” where they collude with criminal elements and unsavory businessmen in illegal activities.|$|R

In Taiwan, most organic catering is vegetarian and affiliated with organic food stores. These offer diners organic meals to make themselves competitive to attract target markets, and provide related information to improve consumers’ knowledge of organic foods and hopefully increase their consumption. Organic catering consumers’ knowledge of organic foods, attitudes toward consumption, and consumption behavior are all related. Consumption is affected by gender, marital status, age, religion, education, occupation, personal health, family health and <b>expenditure</b> <b>allowance.</b> Regular organic catering customers emphasize “balanced nutrition” and “certification or reliability of organic sources”. The obstacles to consumption for non-regular organic catering consumers are “too expensive” and “difficult to find”.

5|$|The {{sovereign}} {{is subject}} to indirect taxes such as value-added tax, and since 1993 the Queen has paid income tax and capital gains tax on personal income. Parliamentary grants to the Sovereign are not treated as income as they are solely for <b>official</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Republicans estimate that the real cost of the monarchy, including security and potential income not claimed by the state, such as profits from the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall and rent of Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, is £334 million a year.|$|R
50|$|The Prince of Wales voluntarily pays a sum {{equivalent}} to income tax on {{that part of}} his income from the Duchy of Cornwall that is in excess of what is needed to meet <b>official</b> <b>expenditure.</b> From 1969 he made voluntary tax payments of 50% of the profits, but this reduced to 25% in 1981 when he married Lady Diana Spencer. These arrangements were replaced by the memorandum in 1993. The income of the Prince of Wales from sources other than the Duchy of Cornwall is subject to tax in the normal way.|$|R

Jan Sunwais are organised independent of the government but government officials are invited to attend. In the form of a hearing, people are invited to give their testimonies which often reveal differences between official records and people's experiences. Before the existence of the RTI Act, it was very difficult to access official records and not many Jan Sunwais could be organised.|$|R

George asked Compton, rather than Walpole, {{to write his}} first speech as king for him, but Compton asked Walpole to draft it. Caroline advised George to retain Walpole, who continued to gain royal favour by securing a generous civil list (a fixed annual amount set by Parliament for the king's <b>official</b> <b>expenditure)</b> of £800,000. Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George {{had little choice but}} to retain him or risk ministerial instability. Compton was ennobled as Lord Wilmington the following year.|$|R
50|$|The British {{royal family}} is financed mainly by the {{hereditary}} revenues of the Crown. The British Parliament uses {{a percentage of}} the Crown Estate, a part of the Crown's hereditary revenues belonging to the sovereign that is placed at the disposal of the House of Commons, to meet the costs of the sovereign's <b>official</b> <b>expenditures.</b> This includes the costs of the upkeep of the various royal residences, staffing, travel and state visits, public engagements, and official entertainment. The Keeper of the Privy Purse is Head of the Privy Purse and Treasurer's Office and has overall responsibility for the management of the sovereign's financial affairs.|$|R
50|$|The Duchy of Cornwall is a Crown entity holding {{land and}} other assets to produce an income for the monarch's eldest child. The Duke of Cornwall (Charles, Prince of Wales) {{receives}} revenue towards charitable work and official activities, supported by The Queen's Grant-in-aid funding to provide assistance with official travel and property. These financial arrangements also cover the <b>official</b> <b>expenditure</b> of some members of his immediate family. The Duchess of Cornwall, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry all have their official expenses paid from Duchy income, assisted by grants-in aid from The Queen. For the fiscal year 2011-12 the Duchy was valued at £728 million with an annual profit of £18.3 million paid to the Prince.|$|R
50|$|In the {{financial}} year ending 31 March 2015, the estate was valued at about £472 million. The {{net income of}} the Duchy is paid to the reigning Sovereign as Duke of Lancaster: it amounts to about £16 million per year. As the Duchy is an inalienable asset of the Crown held in trust for future Sovereigns, the Sovereign is not entitled to the portfolio's capital or capital profits. The Duchy of Lancaster {{is not subject to}} tax, although the Sovereign has voluntarily paid both income and capital gains tax since 1993. As such, the income received by the Privy Purse, of which income from the Duchy forms a significant part, is taxed once <b>official</b> <b>expenditures</b> have been deducted.|$|R
50|$|Set {{against the}} {{backdrop}} of Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, the play depicts a single mother's struggles as welfare cuts affect the poor and disabled. The derogatory term 'spongers' is used by British tabloid press to describe people who are dependent on welfare support, however the play presents the case of a family who really need the help of welfare support. The title sequence shows the title of the play, 'The Spongers', superimposed over a picture of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, denoting them as 'the real spongers' as Royal finances are paid by British taxpayers. For example, the Queen's <b>official</b> <b>expenditure</b> increased by £200,000 from £32.1m in 2010-11 to £32.3m in 2011-12.|$|R
40|$|The South African ("SA") mining {{industry}} played (and continues to play) {{a pivotal role}} in the development of the SA economy. It is therefore no surprise that the industry has long been the beneficiary of favourable tax concessions. One of these favourable tax concessions is the 100 % capital <b>expenditure</b> <b>allowance.</b> Access to this allowance is dependent on the interpretation of the definition of "mining operations" in section 1 (1) of the Income Tax Act, No. 58 of 1962 ("the ITA"). Currently, there is legal uncertainty in SA regarding the meaning of "mining operations". This is so because central to the term "mining operations" is the term "mineral", which is not defined in the ITA, nor does it have an ordinary fixed meaning. SA courts have further not authoritatively dealt with the meaning of "mining operations" despite being presented with the opportunity to do so in recent case law. This legal uncertainty is further fuelled by a recent draft interpretation note issued by the South African Revenue Service ("SARS"), expressing the view that quarrying operations for inter alia clay for brickmaking and limestone for the manufacture of cement, do not constitute "mining operations". Practically, this legal uncertainty may act as a deterrent to mining companies incurring capital expenditure, essentially curbing the development of the SA {{mining industry}}. This study seeks to analyse the different meanings attributed by SARS, SA academic writers and SA courts to the definition of "mining operations" (and the related meaning of "mineral") for income tax purposes. The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether the extraction of clay for brickmaking and limestone for the manufacture of cement constitutes "mining operations". Against this background, Australian legislation and case law on the interpretation of the term "mining operations" and "mineral" will be studied in order to draw a comparison between SA and Australia's treatment of "mining operations". This study further interprets the meaning of "mining operations" through the application of the Savignian interpetation model in terms of which it is concluded that useful guidance can be sought by SA from Australian jurisprudence when interpreting the meaning of the term "mining operations" for income tax purposes and that the purposive test applied in Australia should be adopted by SA courts. Based on the application of this guidance, the key finding of this dissertation is that the extraction of clay for brickmaking and limestone for the manufacture of cement should in principle qualify as "mining operations" and that the capital expenditure incurred in this regard should be eligible for the 100 % capital <b>expenditure</b> <b>allowance...</b>|$|R

Russia's industrial regions included Moscow, the central regions of European Russia, St. Petersburg, the Baltic cities, Russian Poland, some areas along the lower Don and Dnepr rivers, and the southern Ural Mountains. By 1890 Russia had about 32,000 kilometers of railroads and 1.4 million factory workers, most of whom worked in the textile industry. Between 1860 and 1890, annual coal production had grown about 1,200 percent to over 6.6 million tons, and {{iron and steel production}} had more than doubled to 2 million tons per year. The state budget had more than doubled, however, and debt expenditures had quadrupled, constituting 28 percent of <b>official</b> <b>expenditures</b> in 1891.|$|R

5000|$|The {{abolition}} of the Civil List was announced in the spending review statement to the House of Commons on 20 October 2010 by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. In its place, he said, [...] "the Royal Household will receive a new Sovereign Support Grant linked to {{a portion of the}} revenue of the Crown Estate". The Crown Estate is a statutory corporation, run on commercial lines by the Crown Estate Commissioners and generates revenue for HM Treasury every year (an income surplus of £210.7 million for the year ended 31 March 2010). This income is received by the Crown and given to the state {{as a result of the}} agreement reached in 1760 that has been renewed at the beginning of each subsequent reign. The Sovereign Grant Act 2011 received Royal Assent on 18 October 2011. Under this Act, the Sovereign Grant now funds all of the <b>official</b> <b>expenditure</b> of the monarchy, not just the expenditure previously borne by the Civil List.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the precise}} level of German <b>official</b> <b>expenditures</b> in eastern Germany has been {{difficult}} to estimate because funds appropriated in one year might have been spent in another, it is beyond dispute that the federal government expended well over DM350 billion in eastern Germany during the first three years after economic, or monetary, unification. After 1992 this requirement has continued at an annual level of around DM150 billion, so that the sum of private and public funds put into eastern Germany during the half-decade between monetary unification in 1990 and the end of 1995 would probably amount to at least DM750 billion and perhaps as much as DM850 billion. Between one-fifth and one-fourth of those funds were private, and the remainder were government funds. This constituted an infusion of outside money of about DM50,000 for every resident of eastern Germany, a far greater level of assistance than contemplated for any other area that had been behind the Iron Curtain and a token of German determination to bring eastern Germany to western levels as quickly as possible.|$|R
40|$|We apply a {{quadratic}} expenditure {{system to}} estimate price and expenditure elasticities of residential energy demand (electricity and heating) in Germany. Using <b>official</b> <b>expenditure</b> data from 1993 to 2008, we estimate an expenditure elasticity for electricity of 0. 3988 and of 0. 4055 for space heating. The own price elasticity for electricity is - 0. 4310 and - 0. 5008 {{in the case}} of space heating. Disaggregation of households by expenditure and demographic composition reveals that the behavioural response to energy price changes is weaker (stronger) for low-income (top-income) households. There are considerable economies of scale in residential energy use but scale effects are not well approximated by the new OEDC equivalence scale. Real increases in energy prices show a regressive pattern of incidence, implying that the welfare consequences of direct energy taxation are larger for low income households. The application of zero-elasticities in assessments of welfare consequences of energy taxation strongly underestimates potential welfare effects. The increase in inequality is 22 % smaller when compared to the application of rich and disaggregated behavioural response patterns as estimated in this paper...|$|R

However, the size of the slope parameter is significantly less than one, suggesting that the government might face difficulties in financing its future debt. With respect to the revenue-expenditure nexus, the empirical evidence is favourable to the tax-spend hypothesis through the error correction term in the expenditures equation.

40|$|Citizens in OECD {{countries}} quite unambiguously support more {{solidarity and}} justice {{at the international}} level; however, despite {{the adoption of the}} Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by their governments in 2000, they remain insufficiently informed and educated about global development challenges. With increased understanding of the issues, citizens could provide greater support for more efficient and coherent development policies as well as for more funding. This requires new efforts by national authorities to report on desirable outcomes and on the results and effectiveness of international development policies towards achieving them. Development Centre work reveals that public support in OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Member countries for helping poor countries has remained consistently high for almost two decades. Donations from the public to development and emergency NGOs have been increasing, while public concern about aid effectiveness has not hurt continued strong support for official development assistance (ODA). People’s understanding of poverty and development issues, however, remains very shallow, and public awareness about ODA and development co-operation policies is also low. For most people the media provide the primary source of information about developing countries, although there is some evidence of scepticism about its nature. Meanwhile, <b>official</b> <b>expenditure</b> on communication about national aid programmes and development policies remains low.

Historians generally believe that George played an honorific role in Britain, and closely followed the advice of Walpole and senior ministers who made the major decisions. Although the king was eager for war in Europe, his ministers were more cautious. The Anglo-Spanish War was brought to an end, and George unsuccessfully pressed Walpole to join the War of the Polish Succession on the side of the German states. In April 1733, Walpole withdrew an unpopular excise bill that had gathered strong opposition, including from within his own party. George lent support to Walpole by dismissing the bill's opponents from their court offices.|$|R
