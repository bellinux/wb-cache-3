The pH and agar volumes of the medium were adjusted to evaluate these effects on recovery. A pH of 6. 6 prior to autoclaving {{was found to be}} necessary in order to achieve optimum selectivity. At that pH, 5 mLSM successfully eliminated more than 90 % of the Gram-positive rods and 99 % of yeasts present in environmental samples. Catalase-positive, Gram-positive cocci recovered on membrane filters were selected for further testing. Lysostaphin susceptibility, a modified glucose <b>oxidation-fermentation</b> <b>test</b> and growth in thioglycollate medium were used to differentiate staphylococci from micrococci. The modified Hugh-Leifson test for glucose oxidation-fermentation was most accurate in resolving the staphylococci, as 91 % of these isolates were positive for this test. The lysostaphin susceptibility test correctly discerned 95 % of the non-staphylococci that were recovered. A modified version of the Kloos and Schleifer (KEY) Scheme was subsequently employed to speciate the staphylococci. S. epidermidis was the most frequently isolated species, and members of that species group were dominant among identified isolates in six of seven sampling categories. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E
40|$|Aim : Nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB), {{which are}} {{saprophytic}} in nature, {{have emerged as}} important healthcare-associated pathogens. They exhibit resistance not only to beta lactam and the other groups of antibiotics, but also to carbapenems. This study was undertaken to identify the nonfermenters isolated from various clinical samples, to assess their clinical significance, to know the type of healthcare-associated infections they caused, and to know their anti-microbial sensitivity pattern. Materials and Methods : The nonfermenters were identified using a standard protocol that included tests for motility, oxidase production, <b>oxidation-fermentation</b> <b>test</b> for various sugars, gelatin liquefaction, and growth on 10 % lactose agar. The clinical significance was assessed by using various criteria and susceptibility testing was performed {{with the help of}} the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Results : A total of 193 NFGNB were isolated from 189 clinical specimens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common nonfermenter, accounting for 53. 8 %, followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (22. 2 %), and Pseudomonas fluorescens (10. 8 %). Other significant NFGNB isolated were: Sphingobacterium species (5. 2 %), Acinetobacter lwoffii (3. 1 %), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (2. 6 %). P. aeruginosa showed good sensitivity to imipenem (94 %), cefoperazone (70 %), amikacin (69 %), and ticarcillin (63 %). A. baumannii showed 100 % sensitivity to imipenem and 70 % sensitivity to piperacillin. Conclusion : P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii were the common NFGNB isolated in our study from patients of, urinary tract infection, bacteremia, surgical site infections, and ventilator associated pneumonia. P. aeruginosa showed good sensitivity to imipenem, amikacin, and cefoperazone while A. baumannii showed good sensitivity to imipenem and piperacillin...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an approach to}} identify and characterize the microbial community that exists in Jeli Hot Spring, Jeli, Kelantan Darul Naim. The identification {{need to be done}} to identify the kind of organisms that grow in the hot spring. The physical characteristic of Jell Hot Spring water was about 40 - 50 Â°C at pH of between six and eight. The optimum temperature at the Jeli Hot Spring indicates the presence of thermophilic organism since this kind of organism able to live in the extreme environment where other type of organism and bacteria was unable to live in. There were some test carried out to identify the type of thermophilic bacteria which were carried out in morphological, physiological and biochemical test. Ten tests were conducted in order to identify the types of bacteria and determine the characteristic of that organism. The tests that had been done are Gram stain test, endospore test, motility test, biochemical test which consist of oxidase test, <b>oxidation-fermentation</b> <b>test,</b> catalase test, starch agar test, effect of temperature, effect of sodium chloride concentration and lastly the effect of pH on the growth of the thermophilic organism. From the result of the tests, the identity of the organism could be determined and from the characteristic that has been observed from the test, it showed the general structure and microbial activity of this organism. This study can be used for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using the Tag polymerase enzyme in biotechnology area. As for agricultural activity, the thermophilic bacteria are the one that withstand the high temperature during the production of manure and also the rotting of fruit. Apart from that, the organism that lives in hot spring lives in a sulphur environment, which indicates the ability of the organism to degrade the sulphur inside the hot spring to be used for respiration. The ability of these sulphur degrading organisms, it can be applied in agricultural activity which improving organism inside the soil by improving the DNA structure of organism inside the soil to reduce the sulphur exist in the environment to be applicable to the soil...|$|E
40|$|Plasmid profiles, genome {{restriction}} fragment polymorphisms, carbohydrate oxidation-fermentation reactions, methylumbelliferyl substrate hydrolysis patterns, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and results obtained with the Biolog GN biochemical substrate kit {{were used to}} type 19 common-source, but mixed-biotype, outbreak strains and one epidemiologically distinct strain of Pseudomonas pickettii. Biotyping with conventional and methylumbelliferyl substrates failed to distinguish between strains. Plasmid profile testing {{was found to be}} inconsistent and not reproducible. The Biolog GN kit allowed greater strain differentiation than {{restriction fragment}} polymorphism did (12 biotypes versus 5 biotypes); antimicrobial susceptibility testing yielded 4 biotypes, and <b>oxidation-fermentation</b> <b>tests</b> gave 3 biotypes. Oxidation-fermentation results were consistent with restriction fragment polymorphs in all but 1 of the 20 strains tested. For ease of typing, comprehensive typeability, and reproducibility, <b>oxidation-fermentation</b> <b>tests</b> should be performed initially and followed if necessary by restriction fragment polymorph analysis for the elucidation of P. pickettii infection outbreaks...|$|R
