40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the second part}} of a new approach to on-line unsupervised adaptation in speaker verification. The new approach extends previous work in the literature by (1) improving performance on the enrollment handset-type when adapting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> different handset-type (e. g., improving performance on cellular when adapting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> landline <b>office</b> <b>phone),</b> (2) accomplishing this cross channel improvement without increasing the size of the speaker model after adaptation, (3) employing a countbased, parameter-dependent smoothing algorithm that emphasizes the use of mean parameters in the speaker models until sufficient adaptation data are present to accurately estimate variances, and (4) developing a new confidence-based adaptation update weight which minimizes the corrupting effects on the speaker models from impostor attacks. Experimental results show a 61 % (rel.) overall reduction in EER using the new on-line adaptation approach even with a significant impostor attack rate, and a 24 % improvement in EER due to the new confidencebased adaptation scheme for those speaker models corrupted by impostor utterances. 1...|$|R

The winner is expected to reside in the Washington, DC, area for nine months to a year, the academic year generally starting in September and ending by the following August. He or she is also expected to take part in discussions with museum staff and to attend professional seminars and colloquia.

40|$|Seated {{computer}} {{work results}} in prolonged static loading, {{which has been}} associated with the development of musculoskeletal disorders. A popular alternative to sitting <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>office</b> chair while performing computer work is to sit <b>on</b> <b>an</b> exercise ball. Sitting <b>on</b> <b>an</b> exercise ball might affect static and dynamic aspects of working posture. We monitored posture, muscle activation and spinal shrinkage in 10 females performing a 1 -h typing task, while sitting <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>office</b> chair with armrests and while sitting <b>on</b> <b>an</b> exercise ball. Sitting <b>on</b> <b>an</b> exercise ball resulted in 33 % more trunk motion and in 66 % more variation in lumbar EMG. Both of these findings can be considered to be an advantage for the exercise ball. However, the fifth percentile and average lumbar EMG were also higher when sitting <b>on</b> <b>an</b> exercise ball, with 38 % and 78 %, respectively. In addition, more spinal shrinkage occurred when sitting <b>on</b> <b>an</b> exercise ball than when sitting <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>office</b> chair. Arm flexion was reduced, but trapezius activation was unaffected when sitting <b>on</b> <b>an</b> exercise ball. It is concluded that the advantages with respect to physical loading of sitting <b>on</b> <b>an</b> exercise ball may not outweigh the disadvantages. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

5000|$|A {{variation}} of LocalTalk called PhoneNet {{was introduced by}} Farallon Computing. It used standard unshielded side-by-side telephone wire, with six-position modular connectors (same as the popular RJ11 telephone connectors) connected to a PhoneNet transceiver, instead of the expensive, shielded, twisted-pair cable. In addition to being lower cost, PhoneNet-wired networks were more reliable due to the connections being more difficult to accidentally disconnect. In addition, because it used the [...] "outer" [...] pair of the modular connector, it could travel on many pre-existing phone cables and jacks where just the inner pair was in use for RJ11 telephone service. PhoneNet was also able to use <b>an</b> <b>office's</b> existing <b>phone</b> wire, allowing for entire floors of computers to be easily networked. Farallon introduced a 12-port hub, which made constructing star topology networks of up to 48 devices as easy as adding jacks at the workstations and some jumpers in the phone closet. These factors led to PhoneNet largely supplanting LocalTalk wiring in low-cost networking.|$|R
