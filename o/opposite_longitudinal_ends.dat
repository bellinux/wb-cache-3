40|$|A linear metro that is {{propelled}} by a single-sided {{linear induction motor}} (SLIM) has recently attracted much attention. Compared with the rotating-induction-machine drive system, the SLIM drive has advantages such as direct thrust without needing friction between the wheel and the railway track, small cross-sectional area, lack of gear box, and flexible line choice {{on account of the}} greater climbing capability and smaller turning circle. However, due to its cut-open primary magnetic circuit, the SLIM has a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>end</b> effect and half-filled slots on the primary ends, which can reduce the air-gap average flux linkage and thrust. Based on the winding function method, the SLIM is supposed to have the following three groups of windings: 1) primary windings; 2) secondary fundamental windings; and 3) secondary end effect windings. The proposed method considers the actual winding distribution and structure dimensions. It can calculate the mutual, self, and leakage inductance to describe the influence of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>end</b> effect and half-filled slots. Moreover, a new equivalent model is presented to analyze the different dynamic and steady-state performance. Comprehensive comparisons between simulation and experimental results that were obtained from both one arc induction machine and one linear metro indicate that the proposed model can be applied to predict the SLIM performance and control scheme evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Nonlinear {{internal}} waves (NLIWs) are ubiquitous {{features of}} coastal regions in lakes and oceans. NLIWs are typically investigated using direct numerical simulations or laboratory experiments, at low Reynolds number, or through two-dimensional and/or under-resolved three-dimensional (3 D) field-scale numerical simulations. Here, we apply the 3 D non-hydrostatic MITgcm {{to simulate the}} dynamics of NLIWs in long narrow Cayuga Lake (NY). This allows for high-resolution simulation (20 m x 20 m x 0. 5 m) in a closed domain at high Reynolds number (Re ~ 105). Using approximately 300 million grid points, the model accurately reproduces the basin-scale internal seiche response, progressive surges and NLIWs over an 11 -day simulation. Although the lake is long and narrow, sidewall and bottom topographic features readily reflect NLIW packets, causing them to propagate in both the longitudinal and transverse coordinate directions. Chaotic wave profiles result and subsequently shoal along both the basin sidewalls and the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>ends</b> of the basin. Internal wave dynamics in long narrow systems (e. g.

The strain rate {Mathematical expression} used during the tests varied between {Mathematical expression} = 1 × l 0 - 6 s- 1 and 1 × 10 - 4 s- 1. It was shown that, in this zone of slow quasi-static loading of brittle polymethylmethacrylate specimens under conditions of plane stress, the crack initiated for a critical value of loading, at some characteristic zone of strain-rate variation at the crack tip. It was established that for strain rate between {Mathematical expression}= 0. 18 × 10 - 5 s- 1 and {Mathematical expression}= 0. 45 × 10 - 4 s- 1 brittle cracks were propagating always slowly with velocities {{in the range of}} c= 3 to 5 × 10 - 2 m/s. For values of vs outside this transition zone fracture was typically brittle with high crack-propagation velocities. As the strain rate was varying beyond the stable low-velocity region, a two-step crack velocity pattern was operative, where the one step took always low values, and the other step corresponded to crack-propagation velocities significantly higher than these limits, tending to typical brittle-fracture velocities of the material. Oscillations of the velocity c at the transition zones, or, in many cases all over the zone of slow propagation of the crack, indicated the unstable character of crack propagation, influenced by different stress raisers and especially by the <b>opposite</b> <b>longitudinal</b> boundary of the specimen.

40|$|A common {{developmental}} problem {{faced by}} growing multicellular organisms {{is one of}} scaling: as the body grows, organs must retain the proper proportions to function well. Baby-sized lungs could not obtain enough oxygen and a baby-sized heart would pump insufficient blood to supply the needs of an adult, so these organs must scale up in size as the organism grows. Limbs must also scale in both length and diameter to support the growing body mass, although the proportional relationship of limb length to body mass will change throughout growth. However, unlike soft tissue organs, which may expand across their entire volumes, vertebrate long bones lengthen only at specialized sites located at their <b>longitudinal</b> <b>ends,</b> where cartilagi-nous tissue is gradually ossified. The proteins and pathways that drive growth at these sites are well studied, but how they govern proportional scaling of the bone throughout development is poorly understood. Studying bone morphogenesis may therefore bring useful insights into the timing and operation of the developmental signals that guide bone growth. If long bones were simple cylinders, then their growth could be easily conceptualized as tak-ing place through gradual lengthening when new material is added at either end. But actually, the bones sport various protuberances and ridges—symmetry-breaking elements—that allo...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of long multilayered plates subjected to invariant loading along the longitudinal direction. By assuming that the strain field is independent of the longitudinal coordinate, the general form of the displacement field is obtained for a rectangular plate. It is shown {{that there are only}} four types of loading which can be applied at the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>ends</b> of the plate: traction, out-of-plane bending, torsion and in-plane bending. In addition to these loads, the plate can be subjected to any loading on its top/bottom surfaces and any force/displacement boundary conditions at its lateral edges provided that these loads and boundary conditions are invariant along the longitudinal direction. Based on the obtained displacement field, a layerwise stress model, called the LS 1 model, is used to solve the problem. The analytical LS 1 solutions are obtained for general long multilayered plates with arbitrary lateral boundary conditions subjected to all types of invariant loads. Various numerical examples, related to different load conditions, are investigated and the LS 1 results are compared to those obtained by a three-dimensional finite element (3 D-FE) analysis. Excellent agreements in terms of overall stiffness matrix and free-edge interlaminar stresses are found between the LS 1 and 3 D-FE models...|$|R

In order to acquire accurate calculation results of levitation force, different calculation methods, including analytical method, 2 D FEM (finite element method), and 3 D FEM, are applied to investigate the impact of various structural parameters, such as excitation current, air gap, lateral offset, and pole width, on levitation force. The analytical analysis {{is based on the}} classic mathematical model of levitation force between electromagnet and rail and performed with MATLAB. In the 2 D and 3 D FEMs, the numerical calculation of the levitation force is conducted with Ansoft by taking the magnetic saturation into account. In addition, the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>end</b> effect on the levitation force calculation is considered in the 3 D FEM. The results show that the 3 D FEM is the most accurate among the above three methods for calculating the levitation force, and the analytical method can only work for small current and/or large air gap conditions. A lateraloffset between vehicle and rail will reduce the levitation force; the levitation force descends sharply once the lateral offset exceeds the threshold, i.e., 8 % of the pole width for U-shaped electromagnets. The maximum lift-to-weight ratio emerges when the pole width ratio of F type rail to electromagnet is 6 : 7. This may offer a reference for EMS maglev vehicle design and application.|$|R
