40|$|No {{solution}} for the problem of joining aluminium nitride ceramics by means of solder glass is known from the literature. In joining AlN ceramics by means of oxidic glasses, an <b>oxidizing</b> <b>attack</b> of the ceramic phase has to be expected leading {{to a reduction in}} strength of the joined parts due to bubble formation in the joining zone. The objective of the research project was to select a glass system with a minimal <b>oxidizing</b> <b>attack</b> and to optimize its composition in terms of its thermal expansion behavior. The oxygen partial pressure in the glass was to be reduced by adding reducing agents. It was shown that an addition of 2 to 5 wt% Si powder to glass powders of the system SiO_ 2 -Al_ 2 O_ 3 -RO decisively minimizes the bubble formation in the joining zone. By means of a computer program developed {{within the framework of the}} project, glass compositions can be calculated which are adapted to a relatively wide range of thermal expansion coefficients of AlN ceramics. First joining experiments carried out with such modified glass powders produced a strength of approx. 30 % of that of the AlN ceramics. The joining and fracture zones were characterized by optical microscope, SEM photographs and microprobe. The newly developed but not yet optimized glasses with an addition of Si powder are suitable as solder glasses for AlN ceramics. (orig.)

50|$|Metallic lead is <b>{{attacked}}</b> (<b>oxidized)</b> only superficially by air, {{forming a}} thin layer of lead oxide that protects it from further oxidation. The metal is not attacked by sulfuric or hydrochloric acids. It dissolves in nitric acid with the evolution of nitric oxide gas to form dissolved Pb(NO3)2.|$|R
5000|$|VCl4 is {{prepared}} by chlorination of vanadium metal. VCl5 does not form in this reaction; Cl2 lacks the <b>oxidizing</b> power to <b>attack</b> VCl4. VCl5 {{can be prepared}} indirectly, by metathesis of VF5 with BCl3 at −78 °C. [...] In contrast, the heavier analogues NbCl5 and TaCl5 are stable and not particularly oxidizing. VF5 can be prepared directly by fluorination of vanadium metal, reflecting the increased oxidizing power of F2 vs Cl2. Indicative of its oxidizing power, VCl4 releases Cl2 at its boiling point (standard pressure) to afford VCl3.|$|R
40|$|Hydrocarbon-utilizing {{microorganisms}} in {{our culture}} collection oxidized propylene but could not utilize it as the sole source of carbon and energy. When propane-grown cells of Mycobacterium convulutum were placed on propylene, acrylate, the terminally oxidized, three-carbon unsaturated acid, accumulated. A mixed culture and an axenic culture (strain PL- 1) that utilized propylene as the sole source of carbon and energy were isolated from soil. Respiration rates, enzyme assays, fatty acid profiles, and 14 CO 2 incorporation experiments suggest that both the mixed culture and strain PL- 1 <b>oxidize</b> propylene via <b>attack</b> at the double bond, resulting in a C 2 +C 1 cleavage of the molecule...|$|R
40|$|Ascorbic acid oxidase {{activity}} in Myrothecium verrucaria extracts resulted in O 2 uptake exceeding 0. 5 mole per mole of ascorbic acid and in CO 2 evolution. Measurement of oxidized ascorbic acid at {{completion of the}} reaction demonstrated that an average of 10 % of the oxidized product disappeared. A comparison of the gas exchange data {{with the amount of}} ascorbic acid not accounted for indicated that the reaction could not be explained by independent oxidase and oxygenase systems. Chromatographic examination of the reaction mixtures identified l-threonic acid. Experiments with ascorbic acid- 1 - 14 C showed that C- 1 was partially decarboxylated during the oxidation. Test of the fungal extracts for enzymes that might explain the deviation from expected stoichiometry showed that phenolase, glutathione reductase, cytochrome oxidase, peroxidase and oxalic decarboxylase were not involved. Addition of azide in concentrations sufficient to block catalase increased excess O 2 consumption about 65 %. No enzymes were found that could directly <b>attack</b> <b>oxidized</b> ascorbic acid. H 2 O 2 accumulated during oxidation in azide-blocked systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the solution pH on H-terminated silicon surfaces in different electrolytes was investigated by in situ confocal Raman microscopy. This study provides Raman evidence that the initial oxidation of the hydrogenated silicon surface could occur by two paths. In the lower pH solution, the H-terminated silicon surface could be directly <b>oxidized</b> by the <b>attack</b> of OH-; in the higher pH solution, the surface oxidation occurs in the second layer by the insertion of OH- into the back bond of Si-H (Si-Si), in which an intermediate species of -O 3 SiH could be found. In {{the study of the}} {{influence of}} electrolytes, it was found that F- ion could assist and accelerate the oxidation reaction, while the attack of OH- ion is essential to the initial oxidation processes. By taking advantage of Raman spectroscopy {{in the study of the}} low frequency region and analyzing the results from various samples, the assignment of the band located at about 629 cm(- 1) is discussed in detail and attributed to the vibrations of the silicon hydride and multiphonon structure.

40|$|Polyoxometalate anions (POM), {{resulting}} from the condensation of tungstate anions in strongly acidified solutions, can absorb efficiently light in the UV-near Vis region. The produced excited state {{is a very powerful}} oxidative reagent which can, mainly via OH radical <b>attack,</b> <b>oxidize</b> and mineralize a great variety of organic pollutants in aqueous solutions, while the photocatalytic circle is closed by reoxidation of the reduced POM, mainly, by O- 2. Metal ions can also serve as oxidants and close the photocatalytic cycle. In the process metal ions are reduced, precipitated and removed from the solution. Thus photocatalytic treatment for decontamination of waste waters from both organic and inorganic pollutants (metal ions) can be, in principle, achieved.

40|$|ABSTRACT Endogenous oxygen- and nitrogen-centered free {{radicals}} {{are considered to}} play a decisive role {{in a variety of}} diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, atherosclerosis, or cancer. Directly operating antioxidants limit the action of freely diffusing radicals by scavenging the <b>attacking,</b> <b>oxidizing</b> radical and rereducing the oxidized biomolecule, i. e., the biomolecule-derived radical. From textbooks of biochemistry it is understood that NAD(P) H acts as a hydride (hydrogen anion) donor in a variety of enzymatic processes. One example is the re-reduction of GSSG to GSH, catalyzed by glutathione reductase. Because of this reaction, NADPH has been suggested to also act as an indirectly operating antioxidant, thus maintaining the antioxidative power of glutathione. To the best of our knowledge, however, neither NADPH nor NADH has been considered to be directly operating antioxidants. Based on recently published data, new experiments, and theoretical considerations, we propose that NAD(P) H represents a decisive, directly operating antioxidant that should be considered of major importance in the mitochondrial compartment. NAD(P) H fulfills this task both by scavenging toxic {{free radicals}} and repairing biomolecule-derived radicals. —Kirsch, M., de Groot, H. NAD(P) H, a directly operating antioxidant...|$|R
