Divine consideration might be sought to avoid the inconvenient delays of a journey, or encounters with banditry, piracy and shipwreck, with due gratitude to be rendered <b>on</b> <b>safe</b> <b>arrival</b> or return. In times of great crisis, the Senate could decree collective public rites, in which Rome's citizens, including women and children, moved in procession from one temple to the next, supplicating the gods.|$|E

60|$|Early {{the next}} morning Rideau arrived, {{bringing}} with him an imposing number of colored desperadoes; and a written agreement was drawn up. They were to share all risks and expenses, and divide what gold they won <b>on</b> its <b>safe</b> <b>arrival</b> at the coast. Rideau showed bland satisfaction when he read it through; but, before he filled a rusty pen, Dane rose and laid Bonita Castro's keepsake on the table.|$|R
60|$|One fine morning, just as Mr Russ and I were sauntering down to {{the river}} with our rods, a north canoe, full of men, swept round the point above the fort, and {{grounded}} near the wharf. Our rods were soon cast aside, and we were speedily congratulating Mr and Mrs Bain <b>on</b> their <b>safe</b> <b>arrival.</b> These were to be my companions on the impending voyage to Canada, and the canoe in which they had arrived was to be our conveyance.|$|R
60|$|Mary {{soon became}} settled {{in her new}} home, though many {{circumstances}} in her situation were well calculated to disquiet and disturb her. She lived in the palace at Holyrood. The four Maries continued with her for a time, and then {{two of them were}} married to nobles of high rank. Queen Elizabeth sent Mary a kind message, congratulating her <b>on</b> her <b>safe</b> <b>arrival</b> in Scotland, and assuring her that the story of her having attempted to intercept her was false. Mary, who had no means of proving Elizabeth's insincerity, sent her back a polite reply.|$|R
60|$|The {{authorities}} at once {{sent off}} an officer to congratulate their supposed friend <b>on</b> his <b>safe</b> <b>arrival,</b> and {{to express their}} satisfaction at this reinforcement to their strength. On arriving on board, the officer found that he had fallen into a trap. Lord Cochrane announced {{to him that the}} flag-ship would be followed by a numerous fleet with a military force, and that resistance would therefore bring about the destruction of the place and the capture of the fleet and garrison, and he then sent him on shore with letters to the governor to the same effect.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2016 Belhadj {{appealed the}} {{dismissal}} of charges against Mark Allen, who was the director counter-terrorism for MI-6 when he was subjected to extraordinary rendition. [...] Britain's Criminal Prosecution Services dropped the charges against Allen in 2014, claiming they had insufficient evidence, even though the Metropolitan Police had provided them with a 28,000 page dossier. Belhadj's appeal relies on communication from Allen, found {{in the offices of}} Moussa Koussa the head of Muammar Gaddafi's Intelligence service, after those offices were stormed by opposition forces, when Gaddafi was overthrown. In one letter Allen wrote: [...] "I congratulate you <b>on</b> the <b>safe</b> <b>arrival</b> of Belhaj. This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over recent years." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{impact of}} the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, {{especially}} the deaths of Montcalm and Wolfe, has sometimes been exaggerated. Though a major victory, the epic battle did not, at the time, guarantee success for the British campaign. Likewise, though Montcalm’s death was a huge blow to French morale, {{it was not the}} essential element of defeat. The Conquest, simply put, was more than the efforts of two men culminating in one battle. As Matthew Ward argues, the success of the British Conquest in fact hinged more <b>on</b> the <b>safe</b> <b>arrival</b> of the British relief fleet in May 1760. After the Plains of Abraham, the French had regrouped in Montreal under the command of François Gaston de Lévis, leaving the under-supplied British to endure a harsh Canadian winter in a city they had already destroyed.|$|R

60|$|In {{crossing}} {{the country to}} the Niger the white men were the objects of lively curiosity, and the exhibition of the magic lantern, the chemical experiments, and conjuring tricks created an effect equal to that which they had produced among the Fans. On reaching the Niger a canoe was hired with a crew of rowers. In this all the cases, filled with the objects they had collected, were placed, the whole being put in charge of the Houssas, Moses and King John, who had been seized with a fit of homesickness. These were to deliver the cases to the charge of an English agent at Lagos or Bonny, to both of whom Mr. Goodenough wrote requesting him to pay the sum agreed to the boatmen <b>on</b> the <b>safe</b> <b>arrival</b> of the cases, and also to pay the Houssas, who preferred taking their wages there, as it was not considered advisable to tempt the cupidity of any of the native princes along the river. Should they be overhauled the Houssas were told to open the cases and show that these contained nothing but birds' skins and insects, which would be absolutely valueless in the eyes of a native.|$|R

40|$|A single {{photoelectron}} can {{be trapped}} and its photoelectric charge detected by a source/drain channel in a transistor. Such a transistor photodetector {{can be useful}} for flagging the <b>safe</b> <b>arrival</b> of a photon in a quantum repeater. The electron trap can be photo-ionized and repeatedly reset {{for the arrival of}} successive individual photons. This single photoelectron transistor (SPT) operating at the lambda = 1. 3 mu m tele-communication band, was demonstrated by using a windowed-gate double-quantum-well InGaAs/InAlAs/InP heterostructure that was designed to provide near-zero electron g-factor. The g-factor engineering allows selection rules that would convert a photon's polarization to an electron spin polarization. The <b>safe</b> <b>arrival</b> of the photo-electric charge would trigger the commencement of the teleportation algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Industry {{standard}} numerical {{models are}} excellent and accurate tools {{for analysis of}} port plans and design. They link meteorological and oceanographic information to impacts on moored vessels and thereby provide the metocean conditions along the berths. By use of relevant motion and safety criteria for moored vessels, numerical modelling studies can assist the designer and the port owner to determine the optimal protection for the port operation. Operators and users of an exposed port or terminal will {{from time to time}} experience downtime due to adverse weather conditions. Downtime can be associated with strong currents in the approach channel and port entrance or with difficulties encountered for pilot assistance. It can also be due to excessive motions of the vessel resulting in suspension of loading/unloading by cranes or over ramps. If the port operator and the port user receive early information on conditions in and around the port and is able to interpret this information into expected conditions for arriving vessels {{they will be able to}} make prudent decisions <b>on</b> optimal and <b>safe</b> <b>arrival</b> at the port. This paper describes the use of numerical models and state-of-art-methods for ship motion analysis in combination with metocean forecast to build a web-based operational tool for vessels calling at ports and, terminal facilities. The systems present in a user friendly way the forecast exposure at the berths for the coming week which can guide the port operator to select the most suitable time for arrival and berthing and selecting the optimal berth for the planned loading/unloading operation...|$|R
50|$|Despite the <b>safe</b> <b>arrival</b> of {{the ships}} of PQ 14, the return of so many ships with ice damage created a {{shortfall}} in Lend-lease deliveries to the Soviets, and ensured that the Allies would have to run larger convoys during the hazardous summer months to catch up.|$|R
