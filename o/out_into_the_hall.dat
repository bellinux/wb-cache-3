5|$|Martin next awakes in Doggett's home. Wells tells Doggett the {{description}} of the killer but the man isn’t in lock-up yet because that won’t happen until Wednesday. Doggett and Wells arrive at the apartment and retrieve the nanny cam, but discover that someone disabled the cam and used its remote control, a device no one knew about except Mr. and Mrs. Wells and their nanny, Trina Galvez. At Trina Galvez’s home, Wells and Doggett discover the killer, a man named Cesar Ocampo, who threatened to kill Galvez's family if she refused him entrance. At the station house, Doggett informs Wells that Ocampo only wants to talk to him. Ocampo reveals that his brother, Hector, was sentenced to time in prison for a false conviction. Wells bargains with Cesar Ocampo, saying that if Cesar confesses to Vicky’s murder, he will take a look at his brother’s case. Cesar tells him that Hector hung himself in a jail cell a few weeks ago. Doggett calls Martin Wells <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> and the police arrest Martin because they have a case against him. Evidence against Ocampo isn’t strong enough yet.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{appearing}} bored in class at a Catholic high school. Her assistant Felicia Culotta {{played the role}} of Spears's teacher. When the bell rings, Spears runs <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> and begins a choreographed dance in the corridor. After this, Spears is outside, now adorned in an pink athletic outfit, and seen in a car. Along with a couple of other students, she performs a number of gymnastic moves before heading back inside. She is then sitting on the bleachers in the gymnasium watching a basketball game, and she dances in the gymnasium. Her love interest is revealed sitting close to her, played by her real-life cousin Chad. After this short segment, Spears begins her final dance routine and the video ends shortly afterwards, and the bell rings and Spears leaves the gymnasium, revealing that the whole thing had actually just been Spears's daydream. During the very beginning, Spears is seen with her sleeves down. Some people who see the music video may not recognize this, but when the bell rings, the sleeves of exactly the same gray-and-white shirt she is wearing are rolled up, even when she gets into singing.|$|E

60|$|He {{disappeared}} rapidly, and {{was absent}} for several minutes. When he returned he came <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> reception <b>hall.</b>|$|R
60|$|Louisa {{rose and}} went to the door, peeping <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> It was deserted and the dining-room door was shut. She slipped <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> Doctor Newington {{apparently}} did not trouble himself about her. Very softly she closed the library door behind her.|$|E
60|$|I went <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> and {{returned}} with the clothes brush.|$|E
60|$|I shrugged my {{shoulders}} as I walked <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> with him.|$|E
6000|$|SIR, JOHN stands rigid, {{then turns}} and marches {{straight}} <b>out</b> <b>into</b> [...] <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> At a sign from KATHERINE, HUBERT follows him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Prue desires me to {{take you}} <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>hall,</b> and when Mr. Deane beckons, we are to go down at once. The rooms are full, and Jessie is ready. Shall we go?" ...|$|R
50|$|Dawn and Amanda {{break back}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> school, {{but when they}} reach the classroom, they find the door {{unlocked}} and don't see the vampire hiding wedged against the ceiling. The vampire falls as the girls try to leave and it chases them <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> until they reach locked doors. Trapped, Dawn turns to a fire extinguisher and when she can't get it to work, she knocks the vampire around with it instead then bolts with Amanda. Buffy and Spike show the girls a crypt and teach them about the living quarters of vampires. While investigating the area, the girls find a dead body, but Buffy shows them that it's a vampire.|$|R
60|$|Going <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> Arnold found Blanche alone, {{looking at}} the barometer.|$|E

60|$|He {{fastened}} the sword, {{which was}} one of the weapons with which he had been presented, to his girdle; and then went <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> great <b>hall,</b> from which all the other apartments opened. The governor and the two nobles from Tezcuco were awaiting him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{will leave}} it!" [...] cried Christie, with an indignant voice and eye. [...] "Come, dear, we'll go together." [...] And without a look or word for {{any in the}} room, she raised the {{prostrate}} girl, and led her <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> little <b>hall.</b>|$|R
60|$|I went <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> little <b>hall</b> {{and opened}} <b>the</b> door. The {{corridors}} outside were dimly lit, {{but there was}} no mistaking the two men who stood there waiting for me. One was obviously a police inspector, and the man by his side, although he wore plain clothes, could scarcely be anything but a detective.|$|R
60|$|Sherikov {{waited a}} moment. Then he stepped <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> and softly {{closed the door}} after him.|$|E
60|$|Quickly she sprang <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> {{and turned}} the corner {{in time to see}} a strange tableau.|$|E
60|$|When he came <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> {{on tiptoe}} {{he heard the}} would-be burglar moving around the dining-room.|$|E
50|$|Small {{openings}} allow {{visitors to}} view <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Hall.</b> A pyramid shaped atrium brings natural light <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Hall.</b> By making references to local farm architecture around the suburban area of Mississauga {{as well as}} a clocktower—a feature associated with traditional city centres—it connects with its local context and historical architectural ideas, yet is decidedly untraditional in design.|$|R
60|$|I promised her, and, {{slipping}} on some clothes, I went <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> second-story <b>hall.</b> I carried no light. Before I {{had reached the}} bottom of the back stairs I heard David, my man, coming down. To be sure it was he and not a burglar I spoke to him in a low voice, my pistol raised in case of an unsatisfactory reply.|$|R
5000|$|Frankenstein, a smiling, affable {{version of}} Frankenstein's Monster, {{used in a}} number of {{miscellaneous}} sketches over the years, most notably a recurring sketch called [...] "Frankenstein Wastes A Minute of our Time", in which the monster takes a winding journey through Studio 6A, sometimes travelling backstage, through <b>the</b> audience, and <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls,</b> egging on <b>the</b> camera to follow behind him, until he reaches his destination and presents something totally mundane, such as a light switch, or a mop and bucket. This occurs even when there are more interesting things nearby, as in one installment in which he ended up in bandleader Max Weinberg's dressing room, where a dominatrix brandishing a cat o' nine tails was present, and Frankenstein simply picked up a hairbrush and grunted to the camera approvingly. Another sketch involved Frankenstein's wandering through many different halls backstage, until he comes across Tom Hanks leaning against a wall, yanks him aside, and marvels at a light switch.|$|R
60|$|When the inquest was over, Mark, going <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> {{found the}} doctor waiting there for him.|$|E
60|$|MARY (goes <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> rear, {{and comes}} back). He's upstairs. I heard him talking to Eileen.|$|E
60|$|She flung <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> and Mr. Vickers, after a lofty {{glance at}} Mr. Stobell, {{followed}} her outside.|$|E
60|$|It {{was evidently}} {{impossible}} {{to fight in}} a chamber which was blocked by a great table. We followed him <b>out,</b> therefore, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dimly-lit <b>hall.</b> At <b>the</b> farther end a light was shining through an open door.|$|R
60|$|They passed <b>out</b> {{together}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadowy <b>hall,</b> but {{a little}} gleam {{of light from the}} doorway behind them rested on Maud Barrington as she sat down. She looked inquiringly at the man as though in wait for something.|$|R
6000|$|Miles Hendon {{forgot all}} decorum in his delight; and {{surprised}} the King and wounded his dignity, by throwing {{his arms around}} him and hugging him. The woman made her grateful adieux and started away with her pig; and when the constable opened the door for her, he followed her <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> narrow <b>hall.</b> <b>The</b> justice proceeded to write in his record book. Hendon, always alert, thought he would like to know why the officer followed the woman out; so he slipped softly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dusky <b>hall</b> and listened. He heard a conversation to this effect-- ...|$|R
60|$|He drew Holt <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> where Pepper waited. Some one {{slammed the}} door and began to curse.|$|E
60|$|As the {{two young}} men stepped <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> they {{came face to face with}} Elsie and her father.|$|E
60|$|NURSE GUINNESS. Never mind him, doty. [Quite unconcerned, {{she goes}} <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> {{on her way}} to the kitchen].|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Masham {{arrived for}} dinner, {{and in a}} postchaise. The unusual {{conveyance}} reminded them of the morrow very keenly. Venetia {{could not bear to}} see the Doctor's portmanteau taken <b>out</b> and carried <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> She had hopes, until then, that something would happen and prevent all this misery. Cadurcis whispered her, 'I say, Venetia, do not you wish this was winter?' ...|$|R
50|$|The Actor helps Anna {{down from}} her high bed and <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> drafty <b>hall.</b> <b>The</b> sick woman is wrapped in rags. As they go through the door, the landlord, Kostilyoff, enters, nearly {{knocking}} them down. Kostilyoff looks around the dirty cellar and glances several times at Kleshtch, working at his bench. Loudly, the landlord says that the locksmith occupies too much room for two rubles a month and that henceforth the rent will be two and one-half rubles. Then Kostilyoff edges toward Vaska’s room and inquires furtively if his wife has been in. Kostilyoff has good reason to suspect that his wife, Vassilisa, is sleeping with Vaska.|$|R
60|$|She did {{not know}} that Mr. Wilmot thought her silence one of the best signs for the plan, nor how much more {{doubtful}} he would have thought her perseverance, if he had seen her wild and vehement. As it was, he was very much pleased, and when the doctor came <b>out</b> with him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> he could not help expressing his satisfaction in Richard's well-judged and sensibly-described project.|$|R
