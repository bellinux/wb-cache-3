5|$|Along {{with the}} Euphoria engine, Backbreaker also {{features}} a create-a-team tool and logo creator similar to the editor found in Forza Motorsport 2. Players can create their own team <b>or</b> <b>modify</b> an existing team. Players are allowed to take their custom teams online, but are restricted from using the names of existing NFL teams and players.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Entrepreneurial Strategy Matrix" [...] is a {{contingency}} model of entrepreneurial venturing, {{which can be}} utilized when developing a new business venture <b>or</b> <b>modifying</b> an existing venture. Following the established mechanism of a two-axis four-cell model, the Entrepreneurial Strategy Matrix requires the entrepreneur to evaluate two variables inherent in the venture: innovation and risk. Simply defined, innovation {{is the creation of}} something new and different in the new <b>or</b> <b>modified</b> venture. Risk is defined as the probability of major financial loss resulting from the new <b>or</b> <b>modified</b> venture.|$|R

5|$|The Leslie is {{specifically}} designed, via {{reproduction of the}} Doppler effect, to alter <b>or</b> <b>modify</b> sound. As the sound source is rotated around a specific pivot point, it produces tremolo (the modulation of amplitude) and a variation in pitch. This produces a sequence of frequency modulated sidebands. To stop a Leslie's rotor, a special brake circuit {{was added to the}} Leslie motor controls, that incorporated an electronic relay by producing a half-wave of direct current.|$|E
5|$|The revamped Library, {{opened in}} 2013, {{features}} dedicated study areas, a small platform to hold forums and press conferences, {{as well as}} three discussion rooms available for student-teacher consultations, projects and group studies. The Nest, a dedicated maker-space which was opened in March 2017, allows students to design, construct <b>or</b> <b>modify</b> meaningful or handy items with specialised tools in the lab, and supports the school's Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Applied Learning Programme (STEM ALP).|$|E
5|$|Theorists {{also try}} to {{generate}} <b>or</b> <b>modify</b> models {{to take into account}} new data. In the case of an inconsistency between the data and model's results, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces results that fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, {{there are}} five extant schools of Noh acting called Kanze (観世), Hōshō (宝生), Komparu (金春), Kongō (金剛), and Kita (喜多) schools that train shite actors. Each school has its own iemoto family that carries {{the name of the}} school and is {{considered}} the most important. The iemoto holds the power to create new plays <b>or</b> <b>modify</b> lyrics and performance modes. Waki actors are trained in the schools Takayasu (高安), Fukuou (福王), and Hōshō (宝生). There are two schools that train kyōgen, Ōkura (大蔵) and Izumi (和泉). 11 schools train instrumentalists, each school specializing in one to three instruments.|$|E
5|$|Nan Chiau High School commemorated its 70th {{anniversary in}} 2017 along with Nan Chiau Primary School (its former {{ancillary}} primary section before 2001). On 27 January 2017, {{a total of}} 3,398 staff and students both institutions came together to craft knots on a triple-ring with red strings, which resembles the school logo. The event set a national record for the most people making knotted rings together. A dedicated maker-space was also opened on 10 March 2017. Named The Nest, the tools equipped space allow students to design, construct <b>or</b> <b>modify</b> meaningful or handy items in their own accord.|$|E
5|$|Other {{elements}} occasionally {{are classified}} as metalloids. These elements include hydrogen, beryllium, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, zinc, gallium, tin, iodine, lead, bismuth, and radon. The term metalloid also {{has been used for}} elements that exhibit metallic lustre and electrical conductivity, and that are amphoteric, such as arsenic, antimony, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, tin, lead, and aluminium. The p-block metals, and nonmetals (such as carbon or nitrogen) that can form alloys with metals <b>or</b> <b>modify</b> their properties also have occasionally been considered as metalloids.|$|E

One player assumes {{the role of the}} Storyteller, guiding other players through a scenario using the Storyteller interface. The interface allows the Storyteller to create <b>or</b> <b>modify</b> scenarios by placing items, monsters, and characters across the map. Character statistics, such as experience points, abilities, and disciplines, can also be modified. Finally, the Storyteller can assume the role of any character at any given time. These functions allow the Storyteller to dynamically manipulate the play environment while the other players traverse it.|$|E

5|$|Like the iPhone, {{with which}} it shares a {{development}} environment the iPad only runs its own software, software downloaded from Apple's App Store, and software written by developers who have paid for a developer's license on registered devices. The iPad runs almost all third-party iPhone applications, displaying them at iPhone size or enlarging them to fill the iPad's screen. Developers may also create <b>or</b> <b>modify</b> apps {{to take advantage of}} the iPad's features, and there are one million apps optimized for the iPad, as of March 2016. Application developers use iOS SDK for developing applications for iPad. The iPad originally shipped with a customized iPad-only version of iPhone OS, dubbed v3.2. On September 1, it was announced the iPad would get iOS 4.2 by November 2010; to fulfill this Apple released iOS 4.2.1 to the public on November 22.|$|E

5|$|On March 6, 2014, the FCC {{announced}} that it would hold a vote on March 31 on a proposal to ban joint sales agreements involving television stations outright, making them attributable to FCC ownership limits if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time of a competing junior partner station in the JSA; the ban applies to both existing sharing agreements under such a structure as well as pending station transactions that include a JSA. Station owners would be given a two-year grace period to unwind <b>or</b> <b>modify</b> joint sales agreements in violation of the policy; coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market would also be barred under the proposal. Wheeler also proposed an expedited process to review joint sales agreements on a case-by-case basis, granting a waiver of the rules if a broadcaster can prove a particular joint sales agreement arrangement serves the public interest.|$|E
5|$|The Defective Premises Bill was {{introduced}} to the House of Commons as a private member's bill by Ivor Richard on 1 December 1971, and given the Royal Assent on 29 June 1972, coming into force as the Defective Premises Act 1972 on 1 January 1974. The Act establishes a duty of care builders and their sub-contractors owe to the occupiers of property they construct <b>or</b> <b>modify,</b> and also establishes a duty of care landlords hold towards their tenants and any third parties who might be injured by their failure to maintain or repair property. The Act received a mixed reaction from critics; while some complimented it on its simple nature compared to the previously complex common rule laws, others felt that it was too limited for what was desired to be achieved, and that the wording used was at times both too vague and too specific.|$|E
