50|$|The LA30 was {{followed}} in 1974 by the LA36, which achieved far greater commercial success, becoming {{for a time}} the standard dot matrix computer terminal. The LA36 used the same print head as the LA30 but could print on forms of any width up to 132 columns of mixed-case output on standard green bar fanfold paper. The carriage was moved by a much-more-capable servo drive using a DC electric motor and an <b>optical</b> <b>encoder</b> / tachometer. The paper was moved by a stepper motor. The LA36 was only available with a serial interface but unlike the earlier LA30, no fill characters were required. This was possible because, while the printer never communicated at faster than 30 characters per second, the mechanism was actually capable of printing at 60 characters per second. During the carriage return period, characters were buffered for subsequent printing at full speed during a catch-up period. The two-tone buzz produced by 60 character-per-second catch-up printing followed by 30 character-per-second ordinary printing was a distinctive feature of the LA36 quickly copied by many other manufacturers well into the 1990s. Most efficient dot matrix printers used this buffering technique.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a technique for unwarping encoder ripple {{in a low}} cost haptic interface prototype. We previously demonstrated how using a low-resolution <b>optical</b> <b>encoder</b> to electrically commutate a stepper motor can produce high torque levels with low ripple. The <b>optical</b> <b>encoder</b> scheme produces a pair of quadrature voltages that are approximately sinusoidal functions of rotor position. However, because of variations in the optical return from the low-precision encoder disk, quadrature phasing and signal amplitude vary over a mechanical turn. In this paper, we discuss an effective self-calibration technique for unwarping the encoder ripple. The technique is used in a one degree-of-freedom haptic interface prototype, and experiment results quantifying the improved performance due to encoder unwarping are presented...|$|E

30|$|Optical {{read-out}} of {{all eight}} cantilevers is possible by mounting the laser assembly within an optical cage system (Thorlabs Ltd. Cambridgeshire, UK) on high precision automated translation stages (122.2 DD and M- 110.1 DG Precision Micro-Translation Stage; Physik Instrumente Ltd., Bedford, England). Aligning the stages to enable both x-axis and y-axis motion allows movement between cantilevers, and also adjustment to an optimum location along each cantilever. Particularly within dynamic mode operation, optimal amplitude signals {{can be obtained}} by individually positioning the laser on each cantilever separately, as this can compensate for subtle mechanical differences between the cantilevers. For the dynamic mode operation the laser has to be positioned and focussed on a flex point of the cantilever. For example, the node-to-node distance for the 16 th flexural resonance mode is ~ 33  μm, hence the angle sensitive region is approximately 11  μm long.
