5|$|A {{study in}} 2000 {{found that the}} genetic {{distance}} between jackdaws {{and the other members}} of Corvus was greater than that within the rest of the genus. This led Pamela Rasmussen to reinstate the genus name Coloeus, created by Johann Kaup in 1829, in her Birds of South Asia (2005), a treatment also used in a 1982 systematic list in German by Hans Edmund Wolters. A study of corvid phylogeny undertaken in 2007 compared DNA sequences in the mitochondrial control region of several corvids. It found that the western jackdaw, and the closely related Daurian jackdaw (C.dauuricus) of eastern Russia and China, were basal to the core Corvus clade. The names Coloeusmonedula and Coloeusdauuricus have since been adopted by the International Ornithological Congress in their <b>official</b> <b>list.</b> The two species of jackdaw have been reported to hybridise in the Altai Mountains, southern Siberia, and Mongolia. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of specimens of the two species from their core ranges show them to be genetically distinct.|$|E
5|$|During the Civil War, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton {{promised a}} Medal of Honor to every {{man in the}} 27th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment who {{extended}} his enlistment beyond the agreed-upon date. The Battle of Gettysburg was imminent, and 311 men of the regiment volunteered to serve until the battle was resolved. The remaining men returned to Maine, but with the Union victory at Gettysburg the 311 volunteers soon followed. The volunteers arrived back in Maine in time to be discharged with {{the men who had}} earlier returned. Since {{there seemed to be no}} <b>official</b> <b>list</b> of the 311 volunteers, the War Department exacerbated the situation by forwarding 864 medals to the commanding officer of the regiment. The commanding officer only issued the medals to the volunteers who stayed behind and retained the others on the grounds that, if he returned the remainder to the War Department, the War Department would try to reissue the medals.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of {{the passage of the}} Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the West Virginia Legislature at Wheeling passed an act abolishing slavery in West Virginia on February 3, 1865, thus ending the institution of the plantation in West Virginia. Since the 1960s, many of West Virginia's plantation houses have acquired places on the National Register of Historic Places, the United States government's <b>official</b> <b>list</b> of sites, buildings, and structures deemed worthy of preservation. The house at Traveller's Rest, near Kearneysville, is West Virginia's sole plantation house designated as a National Historic Landmark for its national-level historical significance.

5|$|What {{followed}} Marcellinus's act of traditio, if it {{ever actually}} happened, is unclear. There {{appears to have been}} a break in the episcopal succession, however. Marcellinus seems to have died on October 25, 304, and (if he had apostatized) was probably expelled from the church in early 303, but his successor, Marcellus, was not consecrated until either November or December 306. In the meantime, two factions diverged in the Roman church, separating the lapsed, Christians who had complied with the edicts to ensure their own safety, and the rigorists, those who would brook no compromise with secular authority. These two groups clashed in street fights and riots, eventually leading to murders. It is said that Marcellus, a rigorist, purged all mention of Marcellinus from church records, and removed his name from the <b>official</b> <b>list</b> of bishops. Marcellus himself was banished from the city, and died in exile on January 16, 309.|$|E
