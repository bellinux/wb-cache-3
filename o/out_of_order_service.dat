50|$|To {{support the}} {{activities}} of product certification, BIS has a chain of 8 laboratories. These laboratories have established testing facilities for products of chemical, food, electrical and mechanical disciplines. Approximately, 25000 samples are being tested in the BIS laboratories every year. In certain cases where it is economically not feasible to develop test facilities in BIS laboratories and also for other reasons like overloading of samples, equipment being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>order,</b> the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> outside approved laboratories are also being availed. Except for the two labs, all the other labs are NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratiories) accredited. It operates a laboratory recognition scheme also.|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis analyses {{the impact}} of selected factors on the amount <b>of</b> food delivery <b>services</b> <b>ordered</b> by 81 clients of non-profit organization called Oblastní charita Strakonice {{during the period from}} 1. 11. 2013 to 30. 10. 2014. Based on analysis by random effect method, the thesis confirms correlation of monthly number <b>of</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>services</b> with two explanatory variables: number of household members and grade of care subsidy. The analysis implies that increase of number of household members by one member leads to decrease of monthly number <b>of</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>services</b> by 2 - 3 tasks. On the other hand, increase of grade of care subsidy by one grade leads to increase of monthly number <b>of</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>services</b> by approximately two tasks. Other factors included to the models are not correlated with explained variable at level below alpha = 0, 1. Findings mentioned above are consistent with information said in the theoretical part of my thesis...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytic model for investigating the throughput, delay and buffer utilization characteristics <b>of</b> partially <b>ordered</b> transport <b>services.</b> We analyze {{the effects of}} packet and ack losses as well as applications' order requirements on overall system performance. The analytic model is verified by comparing its results against those of an OPNET simulation model. Analytic results show that for applications that can tolerate some reordering {{in the delivery of}} objects, use <b>of</b> partially <b>ordered</b> <b>service</b> instead <b>of</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>service</b> provides important buffer utilization and delay improvements, particularly as the loss rate increases and the <b>order</b> requirements <b>of</b> applications decrease. In terms of throughput, it makes no difference which <b>service</b> (i. e., <b>ordered,</b> partially ordered, unordered) an application uses. Analytic study also shows that by judicious choice <b>of</b> sender's transmission <b>order,</b> overall system performance can further be improved in a partially <b>ordered</b> <b>service.</b> Keyw [...] ...|$|R
