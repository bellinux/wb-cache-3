25|$|Protests {{broke out}} across the country on 5 August 2016 and dozens of protesters were {{subsequently}} {{shot and killed by}} police. The protesters demanded an end to human rights abuses, the release of political prisoners, a fairer redistribution of the wealth generated by over a decade of economic growth, and a return of Wolqayt District to the Amhara Region. The events were the most violent crackdown against protesters in Sub-Saharan Africa since the Ethiopian regime killed at least 75 people during protests in the Oromia Region in November and December 2015. Following these protests, Ethiopia {{declared a state of emergency}} on 6 October 2016. The state <b>off</b> <b>emergency</b> was lifted in August 2017.|$|E
500|$|Near the South Africa {{border with}} Swaziland, {{flooding}} stranded about 80,000people on tribal lands. One {{road in the}} country was converted into a makeshift landing strip to allow helicopters and planes to drop <b>off</b> <b>emergency</b> supplies. A period of heavy rain flooded Umfolozi River, which destroyed a rail bridge near Mtubatuba and a bridge crossing highway N2.

50|$|After {{removing}} his bandages, Héctor 2 convinces the scientist {{to send him}} back several seconds before he initially appears. He finds a van and runs Héctor 2 off the road, but crashes as well, knocking himself out. Upon waking, he informs the scientist he has failed and to stop Héctor 2 by any means. He encounters the woman again, startling her into screaming, though she does not recognize him as her assailant. Since Héctor 2 has heard her scream, Héctor 3 and the woman flee to Héctor's house. They become separated. Héctor 3 finds and hides his wife, then realizes {{what has to happen}} / will happen / has already happened. He finds the woman, cuts her ponytail off, gives her his wife's coat, and tells her to hide upstairs. Héctor 2 chases her onto the roof. Héctor 3 sits on his lawn with his wife, as Héctor 2 accidentally kills the woman, then drives <b>off.</b> <b>Emergency</b> vehicles are heard approaching in the distance.|$|E

The control design approach of manufacture, which is using as self-energy production solutions and municipal utility services, is discussed. The correlation of manufacturing processes with emergency situations in critical infrastructure is taken in the account. The development of novel methods of power supply control in critical infrastructure and its integration in autonomous manufacturing system are offered.

50|$|Reese battles his {{way through}} the marshals while Quinn {{attempts}} negotiating with the head marshal, Pollack (Richard Brooks), in his hotel room. Reese's attacks outside change Pollack's mind, but Reese sets <b>off</b> <b>emergency</b> flares throughout the halls and fights his way into Quinn's room. Reese demands to know Simmons' escape route in the next three minutes, dismissive of Quinn's virtues of loyalty. Down below, the team is able to make it past the marshals and Finch arrives right as Reese is about to kill Quinn, having obtained Simmons' location. Finch tries to convince Reese that killing Quinn would betray Carter's principles of bringing Quinn down on legal terms, but Reese, succumbing to his wounds, goes through with the shot, only to discover his gun is empty. Reese collapses and is moved out while officers enter and take Quinn away. In the car, Root points out that Reese wasn't Simmons' only predator, while Fusco is seen stealing the paper on which Quinn wrote Simmons' location.|$|E

50|$|Although the Bureau of Indian Affairs {{continued}} to run programs during the shutdown that were deemed essential, including firefighting and police services, it stopped financing tribal governments {{as well as}} many programs, grants, and services that provide necessary support for often-impoverished reservations. The cuts shut down programs that provide income, medical care, food, transportation, domestic violence protection, and foster care to communities, resulting in a sense of fear among many people who rely on these services. Some tribes were able to continue funding programs temporarily themselves, but others had to suspend programs immediately. For example, the Crow Tribe of Montana furloughed 364 employees, {{more than a third of}} its workforce, and suspended programs providing health care, bus services and improvements to irrigation. The Yurok tribe of Northern California, which relies almost exclusively on federal funds, furloughed 60 out of its 310 employees, closed its child care center, and cut <b>off</b> <b>emergency</b> financial assistance to the poor and elderly. The Yurok Indian Reservation had an unemployment rate exceeding 80% before the shutdown. In Minnesota, the Red Lake Band of Chippewa were supposed to receive $1 million from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to help operate their government, but were not given access to the money before the shutdown and were forced to halt all non-emergency medical procedures. The White Buffalo Calf Woman Society, a domestic violence shelter that serves the Rosebud Reservation and surrounding communities in South Dakota, lost 90% of its funding due to the shutdown and was forced to turn victims away.|$|E
50|$|In this INSAG report, most of {{the earlier}} accusations against staff for breach of {{regulations}} were acknowledged to be either erroneous, based on incorrect information obtained in August 1986, or less relevant. This report reflected another view {{of the main reasons}} for the accident, presented in Appendix I. According to this account, the operators' actions in turning <b>off</b> the <b>Emergency</b> Core Cooling System, interfering with the settings on the protection equipment, and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude, although they may have been a breach of regulations. Turning <b>off</b> the <b>emergency</b> system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations.|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotives}} had Heusinger-Walschaerts valve gear, bar {{frames and}} were superheated. They had round-topped fireboxes, unlike the earlier Modified Fairlie locomotives which had Belpaire fireboxes. They were fitted with the Parry soot-blower which enabled the boiler tubes {{to be cleaned}} during running conditions. Reversing was effected from the driver's cab by Hendrie's steam reversers.

40|$|The {{at least}} one contact sensor (86, 88) is {{recessed}} inside the ring of bristles (66) and turns with the brush roller (46). The contact sensor has a threshold limit switch adjustable to a radial operating force, for releasing an <b>emergency</b> <b>off</b> signal. The sensor bristle holder {{is in the form}} of a lever with restricted movement, and extending over part of the brush roller's (58) periphery. The holder rotates on an axle parallel to the pivot axle of the brush roller against the adjustable force of a counter holding spring. ADVANTAGE - The brush head activates an <b>emergency</b> <b>off</b> switch for critical situations to avoid damaging the surface being cleaned...|$|R

25|$|The second {{mechanism}} {{is a force}} imbalance at the calving front due to thinning causing a substantial non-linear response. In this case an imbalance of forces at the calving front propagates up-glacier. Thinning causes the glacier to be more buoyant, reducing frictional back forces, as the glacier becomes more afloat at the calving front. The reduced friction due to greater buoyancy allows {{for an increase in}} velocity. This is akin to letting <b>off</b> the <b>emergency</b> brake a bit. The reduced resistive force at the calving front is then propagated up-glacier via longitudinal extension because of the backforce reduction. For ice streaming sections of large outlet glaciers (in Antarctica as well) there is always water {{at the base of the}} glacier that helps lubricate the flow.|$|R
50|$|At 18:39, the {{aircraft}} touched {{down on the}} runway at Istanbul Yeşilköy Airport but an electrical power failure at the airport {{at that very moment}} forced the crew to initiate a missed approach.

At 18:43, the crew asked for permission to land while positioning for another approach. However, because another aircraft, a Pan American World Airways Boeing 747, was about to take off, air traffic control ordered the crew of Flight 345 to fly an extended downwind leg. When, at 18:53, air traffic control attempted to establish contact with flight 345, it received no answer.|$|R
