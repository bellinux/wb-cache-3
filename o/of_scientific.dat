5|$|Bird {{collections}} are curated repositories <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> specimens consisting {{of birds and}} their parts. They are a research resource for ornithology, the science of birds, and for other scientific disciplines in which information about birds is useful. These {{collections are}} archives of avian diversity and serve the diverse needs <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> researchers, artists, and educators.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} and description of new species and {{the collection of}} specimens became a passion <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> gentlemen and a lucrative enterprise for entrepreneurs; many naturalists traveled the globe in search <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> knowledge and adventure.|$|E
5|$|A major {{development}} {{in recent decades}} has been {{the study of the}} formation, structure, and evolution <b>of</b> <b>scientific</b> communities by sociologists and anthropologists - including David Bloor, Harry Collins, Bruno Latour, and Anselm Strauss.

This interdisciplinary field {{has come to be known}} as science and technology studies.|$|E

5|$|From 1950 to 1952, {{there were}} a series of {{disputes}} between EES director Rosselot and Georgia Tech vice president Cherry Emerson over the station's finances and Rosselot's hand in founding Scientific Associates. When {{it was founded in}} October 1951, Rosselot was president and CEO <b>of</b> <b>Scientific</b> Associates; at issue was the potential conflict of interest with his role at Georgia Tech, and what, if any, role Georgia Tech should have in technology transfer to the marketplace. Emerson later instituted a policy requiring EES employees wishing to work with Scientific Associates to make a written request to the president of Georgia Tech. However, Rosselot's participation in Scientific Associates' founding and early operations ensured the eventual success <b>of</b> <b>Scientific</b> Atlanta and facilitated subsequent technology transfer by Georgia Tech's VentureLab and the Advanced Technology Development Center.|$|E
5|$|Glen P.

Robinson worked as the general manager without pay for the first year; after the fledgling company's first contract resulted in a $4,000 loss, Robinson (upon request) refunded {{five of the six}} other initial investors. Despite its rocky start, the company managed to succeed. In 1951, there was a dispute over station finances and Rosselot's hand in the foundation <b>of</b> <b>Scientific</b> Atlanta against Georgia Tech vice president Cherry Emerson. Initially, Rosselot was president and CEO <b>of</b> <b>Scientific</b> Atlanta, but later handed off responsibility to Glen P. Robinson; at issue were potential conflicts of interest with his role at Georgia Tech and what, if any, role Georgia Tech should have in technology transfer to the marketplace. Rosselot eventually resigned his post at Georgia Tech, but his participation ensured the eventual success <b>of</b> <b>Scientific</b> Atlanta and made way for further technology transfer efforts by Georgia Tech's VentureLab and the Advanced Technology Development Center.|$|E
