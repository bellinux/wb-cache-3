[...] Editor Chris Logan explained: [...] "The book’s content is very serious, but it's not presented in an overly serious way." [...] The Simpsons Archive also described {{the balance between}} humor and academia in the book, noting: [...] "Fortunately, despite numerous references to various psychological theories and academic studies, the essays steer clear of becoming too serious, and manage to stay entertaining throughout the book." ...|$|E
500|$|Earthsuit {{music was}} {{primarily}} rock, but also possessed strong hip-hop, electronica, reggae, soul, and experimental elements. Their sound had sometimes {{been compared to}} The Police, while Meany's rapping had been likened to the Beastie Boys. Adam LaClave stated the differing musical tastes of the band helped cultivate their sound: [...] "Each <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> really {{into a lot of}} different things ... it helps make our sound because you can hear all kinds of things". Live performances were characterized by [...] sunglasses, futuristic costumes, and energetic showmanship. Many bands have influenced Earthsuit's style; the group has performed covers of songs by Basement Jaxx, Black Sheep, Kraftwerk, and The Talking Heads. They have also utilized samples by DJ Shadow and The Verve.|$|E

[...] Simon Rattle also described the Fifth Symphony, rather than the Fourth as proclaimed by the composer, as being Nielsen's war symphony. In fact, the phrase [...] "dark, resting forces, alert forces" [...] {{can be found on the}} back cover of the pencil draft score. Nielsen might have considered it an encapsulation of the contrast both between and within the two movements of the symphony. Nielsen also wrote to Dolleris about the presence of the [...] "evil" [...] motif in the first movement of the Fifth Symphony: ...|$|E

The Swedish premiere was attended by Crown Princess Victoria. Bilheimer recognized that people combatting human trafficking are in need of resources, so he considered various options with respect to the intellectual property of Not My Life, ultimately deciding to release the film at charge in addition to selling licenses for unlimited private screenings. On November 1, an 83-minute version of the film was released on DVD by Worldwide Documentaries, which also began digitally distributing the film and selling the unlimited licenses. LexisNexis, the governments of Arizona and Minnesota, and the U.S. Fund for UNICEF all purchased licenses. The latter organization planned to use the film as part of an anti-human-trafficking campaign.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{recording}} <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>Is</b> the Killer, {{the band}} essentially constructed a studio around its practice space. Vocalist Greg Puciato {{noted that the}} album [...] "took a lot longer" [...] to record, [...] with the band members recording their respective instruments on consecutive days rather than alternating: [...] "This time we did it traditionally and everyone tracked their instruments in succession.

2500|$|The game's {{documentation}} explained Edu-Ware's {{view that}} the Prisoner television series was [...] "a political and social statement concerning the problem of keeping one's individuality and personal freedom in a technological society... is a collective prison and [...] each <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is,</b> in fact, a prisoner." [...] With the year 1984 looming only four years away from {{the date of the}} game's publication, Edu-Ware held that many of the issues raised in the 1969 television series were as relevant as ever, and thus it was [...] "appropriate that a show concerned with the theme of loss of individuality and influence over... own lives should inspire a game to be played on a computer." ...|$|E

Since Jefferson was very discreet, no one knows for certain the extent of their relationship. Jefferson eventually stopped writing her until some time later when she contacted him; their renewed correspondence continued until his death. Historians such as Andrew Burstein have suggested the relationship was romantic mostly on Jefferson's side, and that Cosway was his opposite, more artistic than rational. Their correspondence survives. Before Jefferson left Paris, he wrote her, [...] "I am going to America and you are going to Italy. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> going the wrong way, for the way will ever be wrong that leads us further apart." ...|$|E

Gibbons received 278,984 votes to Titus's 255,675. Titus won Clark County, Nevada's most populous, but Gibbons won every other county.
