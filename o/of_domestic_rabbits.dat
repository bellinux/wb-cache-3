60|$|Several breeds of the fowl {{have either}} {{spangled}} or pencilled feathers; and these cannot {{be derived from}} the parent-species, the Gallus bankiva; though {{of course it is}} possible that one early progenitor of this species may have been spangled, and another pencilled. But, as many gallinaceous birds are either spangled or pencilled, it is a more probable view that the several domestic breeds of the fowl have acquired this kind of plumage from {{all the members of the}} family inheriting a tendency to vary in a like manner. The same principle may account for the ewes in certain breeds of sheep being hornless, like the females of some other hollow-horned ruminants; it may account for certain domestic cats having slightly-tufted ears, like those of the lynx; and for the skulls <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits</b> often differing from one another in the same characters by which the skulls of the various species of the genus Lepus differ.|$|E

60|$|The {{belief that}} there exists in man some close {{relation}} between {{the size of the}} brain and the development of the intellectual faculties is supported by the comparison of the skulls of savage and civilised races, of ancient and modern people, and by the analogy of the whole vertebrate series. Dr. J. Barnard Davis has proved[209] by many careful measurements, that the mean internal capacity of the skull in Europeans is 92·3 cubic inches; in Americans 87·5; in Asiatics 87·1; and in Australians only 81·9 inches. Professor Broca[210] found that skulls from graves in Paris of the nineteenth century, were larger than those from vaults of the twelfth century, in the proportion of 1484 to 1426; and Prichard is persuaded that the present inhabitants of Britain have “much more capacious brain-cases” than the ancient inhabitants. Nevertheless it must be admitted that some skulls of very high antiquity, such as the famous one of Neanderthal, are well developed and capacious. With respect to the lower animals, M. E. Lartet,[211] by comparing the crania of tertiary and recent mammals, belonging to the same groups, has come to the remarkable conclusion that the brain is generally larger and the convolutions more complex in the more recent form. On the other hand I have shewn[212] that the brains <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits</b> are considerably reduced in bulk, in comparison with those of the wild rabbit or hare; and this may be attributed to their having been closely confined during many generations, so that they have exerted but little their intellect, instincts, senses, and voluntary movements.|$|E

5000|$|As the Belgian Hare has a {{very high}} {{metabolic}} rate, it may require more food and more consistent feeding than other breeds <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbit.</b> The specific dietary requirements of a Belgian Hare do not differ significantly from other breeds <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbit,</b> and like the majority of rabbits, the most {{important component of the}} diet of a Belgian Hare is hay, a roughage that reduces the chance of blockages and malocclusion whilst providing indigestible fiber necessary to keep the gut moving. Grass hays such as timothy are generally preferred over legume hays like clover and alfalfa. Legume hays are higher in protein, calories, and calcium, which in excess can cause kidney stones and loose stool. This type of hay should be reserved for young kits or lactating does.|$|R
