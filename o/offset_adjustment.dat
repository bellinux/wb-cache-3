Every step on the resistor ladder has its own switch which can connect this step to the output terminal of the potentiometer. The selected step on the ladder determines the resistance ratio of the digital potentiometer. The number of steps is normally indicated with a bit value e.g. 8 bits equals 256 steps; 8 bits is the most common, but resolutions between 5 and 10 bits (32 to 1024 steps) are available. [...] A digital potentiometer uses digital protocols like I²C or Serial Peripheral Interface Bus for signalling; some use simpler up/down protocols. Some typical uses of digital potentiometers are in circuits requiring gain control of amplifiers (frequently instrumentation amplifiers), small-signal audio-balancing, and <b>offset</b> <b>adjustment.</b>|$|E

30|$|For a {{significant}} US dollar depreciation (at lower quantiles), the extreme impacts of oil {{supply and demand}} shocks on exchange rates are shown in Table  4. For oil-exporting countries, the estimated coefficients on oil supply shock variables are negative and statistically significant for Canada, Mexico and the UK at the 0.01 quantile, and for Norway at the 0.05 quantile. While for oil-importing countries, oil supply shocks only have positive and significant impacts on exchange rate returns in the EU. These results can be easily explained. The oil supply shocks possibly reflect the discovery of new oil fields, better extraction technologies or a decline in OPEC’s control over the oil supply. Following an oil supply shock that alters the oil balance, the real exchange rate moves to ensure an <b>offsetting</b> <b>adjustment</b> in the non-oil trade balance in order to stabilize net foreign assets. Therefore, a positive oil supply shock has negative impacts (US dollar depreciation) on exchange rate returns in oil-exporting countries while having positive impacts (US dollar appreciation) in oil-importing countries.|$|R
40|$|Many {{economists have}} {{recently}} proposed nominal GNP targetting {{as a new}} rule for monetary p 0 licy. l Nominal GNP targetting is typically viewed {{as an alternative to}} money-growth targetting. It prescribes that policymakers should aim to keep nominal GNP [...] rather than the money supply [...] growing along a target path. The rule seems attractive for two reasons. First, it would automatically call for an <b>offsetting</b> <b>adjustment</b> in money growth in response to velocity shocks and this should stabilize real GNP. Second, it would automatically call for a reduction in real GNP growth in response to price shocks and this should stabilize inflation. The rule also has the virtue of simplicity. Explaining how it works to policymakers seems easy. Consider the typical explanation of the two automatic adjustments. (1) Nominal GNP is the product of money and veloci-ty. The rule is to keep nominal GNP on a fixed target: when velocity goes down, money must be increased by an equal amount. Hence, velocity shocks are automatically offset. (2) Nominal GNP is also the product of the pric...|$|R
40|$|Wireless systems perform rate {{adaptation}} to transmit at highest possible instantaneous rates. Rate adaptation has been increasingly granular over generations of wireless systems. The base-station uses SINR and packet decode feedback called acknowledgement/no acknowledgement (ACK/NACK) to perform {{rate adaptation}}. SINR {{is used for}} rate anchoring called inner look adaptation and ACK/NACK is used for fine <b>offset</b> <b>adjustments</b> called Outer Loop Link Adaptation (OLLA). We cast the OLLA as a reinforcement learning problem {{of the class of}} Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) where the different offset values are the arms of the bandit. In OLLA, as the offset values increase, the probability of packet error also increase, and every user equipment (UE) has a desired Block Error Rate (BLER) to meet certain Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. For this MAB we propose a binary search based algorithm which achieves a Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) solution making use of bounds from large deviation theory and confidence bounds. In addition to this we also discuss how a Thompson sampling or UCB based method will not help us meet the target objectives.

40|$|The {{retrieval}} (estimation) of {{sea surface}} temperatures (SSTs) from space-based infrared observations is increasingly performed using retrieval coefficients derived from radiative transfer simulations of top-of-atmosphere brightness temperatures (BTs). Typically, {{an estimate of}} SST is formed from a weighted combination of BTs at a few wavelengths, plus an offset. This paper addresses two questions about the radiative transfer modeling approach to deriving these weighting and offset coefficients. How precisely specified do the coefficients {{need to be in}} order to obtain the required SST accuracy (e. g., scatter < 0. 3 K in week-average SST, bias < 0. 1 K) ? And how precisely is it actually possible to specify them using current forward models? The conclusions are that weighting coefficients can be obtained with adequate precision, while the offset coefficient will often require an empirical adjustment of the order of a few tenths of a kelvin against validation data. Thus, a rational approach to defining retrieval coefficients is one of radiative transfer modeling followed by <b>offset</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The need for this approach is illustrated from experience in defining SST retrieval schemes for operational meteorological satellites. A strategy is described for obtaining the required <b>offset</b> <b>adjustment,</b> and the paper highlights some of the subtler aspects involved with reference to the example of SST retrievals from the imager on the geostationary satellite GOES- 8...|$|E

40|$|As the baby-boom {{generation}} retires {{over the}} next two decades, there will be a sharp increase in the fraction of the population eligible to receive public pension benefits. This increase would happen even without ongoing reductions in mortality rates and the resultant increases in life expectancy. However, reductions in mortality mean that the impact will be even greater, especially if no <b>offsetting</b> <b>adjustment</b> is made to the age at which people are eligible to receive pension benefits. Continued gains in life expectancy, when not accompanied by an extension of working life, result in increasingly large fractions of the human lifespan being spent in retirement. That, in turn, gives rise to concerns about prospective increases in public pension costs and the level of support expected from the post-baby-boom generation. At the same time, the age at which benefits are payable affects the age of retirement. We illustrate how a gradual and modest increase in the age of eligibility for public pension benefits (defined here to include those available under the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans, CPP/QPP, and Old Age Security, OAS) would (1) moderate the inevitable decline {{in the size of the}} labour force relative to the size of the population eligible to receive retirement pensions and (2) reduce the contribution rate needed to maintain the retirement income system...|$|R

40|$|The last 15 {{years have}} seen a {{revolution}} in the way financial economists understand the world around us. We once thought that stock and bond returns were essentially unpredictable. Now we recognize that stock and bond returns have a substantial predictable component at long horizons. We once thought the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) provided a good description of why average returns on some stocks, portfolios, funds or strategies were higher than others. Now we recognize that the average returns of many investment opportunities cannot be explained by the CAPM, and multifactor models' have supplanted the CAPM to explain them. We once thought that long-term interest rates reflected expectations of future short term rates and that interest rate differentials across countries reflected expectations of exchange-rate depreciation. Now, we see time-varying risk premia in bond and foreign exchange markets as well as in stock markets. Once, we thought that mutual fund average returns were well explained by the CAPM. Now, we recognize ``value'' and other high return strategies in funds, and slight persistence in fund performance. In this article, I survey these new facts. I show how they are related. Each case uses price variables to infer market expectations of future returns; each case notices that an <b>offsetting</b> <b>adjustment</b> (to dividends, interest rates, or exchange rates) seems to be absent or sluggish.

40|$|Summary: Use of lumbar spine T-score or minimum T-score as a {{bone mineral}} density (BMD) input to the FRAX® {{algorithm}} led to miscalibration {{compared with the}} recommended femoral neck input. Use of a weighted mean between the lumbar spine and femoral neck T-scores was found to provide an arithmetically equivalent result to a previously described <b>offset</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Introduction: FRAX assumes that the BMD input, when used in the calculation, is from the femoral neck. Use of other BMD inputs is not recommended, {{but there are no}} studies describing how this affects the performance of FRAX. Methods: Ten-year probabilities of a major osteoporotic fracture were calculated with different BMD inputs for 20, 477 women and men aged 50 years and older from Manitoba, Canada. FRAX probability calculated with femoral neck BMD was designated the reference method. We also derived FRAX probabilities where the BMD input was based upon the lumbar spine T-score, minimum T-score (lumbar spine or femoral neck), weighted mean T-score (lumbar spine or femoral neck), or used an adjustment for the spine–hip T-score difference (offset). Fracture outcomes were assessed using a population-based administrative data repository. Results: All FRAX models showed good risk stratification with minimal differences. There was no consistent improvement in FRAX performance when lumbar spine or minimum T-score were used as inputs, but calibration was adversely affected due to higher mean fracture probabilities compared with the femoral neck. The weighted mean T-score was found to be equivalent to the spine–hip T-score <b>offset</b> <b>adjustment,</b> and both slightly improved risk classification without a change in calibration. Conclusions: The choice of BMD input to the FRAX model has a large effect on performance. The lumbar spine T-score or minimum T-score should not be used as inputs to the FRAX algorithm. Use of a weighted mean between the lumbar spine and femoral neck T-scores slightly improves risk classification...|$|E
