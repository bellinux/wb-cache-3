Experimental {{results show that the}} size of the grain of the feedstock grows slowly with an increase of on-line solution temperature, the size of strengthening phase becomes smaller and the density becomes bigger with an increase of extrusion ratio. The tensile strength of AA- 6201 feedstock after T- 6 treated increases with an increase of extrusion ratio, <b>on-line</b> <b>cooling</b> speed, and with a decrease of solution temperature, and the conductivity is a little penalty. Under the conditions of the extrusion ratio 16. 5, on-line solution temperature 793. 15 K and ageing temperature 423. 15 K, the tensile strength, elongation and conductivity are 324 MPa, 10. 1 % and 53. 0 % IACS respectively.

40|$|M. Tech. (Mechanical Engineering Technology) This project {{researched}} {{the feasibility of}} using an existing mitre bend on the main condenser crossover ducting as an on-line flow measuring system. This flow measurement {{is based on the}} principle of an elbow type of flow meter. There are no detailed published standards or specifications available for Elbow flow meters. The knowledge of the cooling water flow rate through the individual condensers would allow turbine heat rate calculations to be performed. In addition condenser, cooling tower and cooling water pump performance can be evaluated. An on-line system would also highlight potential problems sooner, thus eliminating costly unplanned shutdowns. The majority of the straight length of condenser cooling water piping is under concrete, thus making access very difficult. The exposed condenser piping geometry is not ideal, with very distorted flow profiles expected, due to bends, valves, reducers, etc. Conventional flow measuring systems can therefore not be used, as ideal flow conditions (profiles) before and after the measuring instrument are required to er. sure the specified accuracy. The mitre bend being part of the piping geometry does not introduce additional head loss to the system and coupled to the low cost factor of an elbow type meter was the principal reason for the choice of this type of measuring system. Part of the innovative aspect of this research is that a conventional elbow is not used but an existing mitre bend is utilised as the fundamental flow measuring device. The Elbow/Bend differential pressure method to measure the condenser cooling water flow rate was investigated in the Flow laboratory at Eskom (Technology Research and Investigations). A geometrically similar mitre bend was purchased and installed onto the 700 mm NB pipeline at the laboratory. The diametrical differential pressure was measured at the 22. 5 ° and 45 °axes of the 0. 8 D mitre bend. The differential pressure was related to the fluid flow rate, and a calibration constant C was determined. The velocity profiles under the test conditions were verified. A Computational Fluid Dynamics model of the laboratory mitre bend was also produced. The model provided a clearer understanding of the internal flow patterns and the exact pressures on the inside and outside of the bend. The tests that were conducted in the laboratory confirmed the suitability of converting the main condenser crossover ducting mitre bends into an <b>on-line</b> <b>cooling</b> water flow measuring systems...|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is proposed}} for <b>on-line</b> monitoring of <b>cooling</b> load supplied by Telecommunication (TLC) cooling systems. Sensible cooling load is estimated via a proportional integral controller-based input estimator, whereas a lumped parameters model was developed aiming at estimating {{air handling units}} (AHUs) latent heat load removal. The joint deployment of above estimators enables accurate prediction of total cooling load, {{as well as of}} related AHUs and free-coolers energy performance. The procedure was then proven effective when extended to cooling systems having a centralized chiller, through model-based estimation of a key performance metric, such as the energy efficiency ratio. The results and experimental validation presented throughout the paper confirm the suitability of the proposed procedure as a reliable and effective energy monitoring and diagnostic tool for TLC applications. Moreover, the proposed modeling approach, beyond its direct contribution towards smart use and conservation of energy, can be fruitfully deployed as a virtual sensor of removed heat load into a variety of residential and industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|<b>On-line</b> {{spray water}} <b>cooling</b> (OSWC) of electric-resistance-welded (ERW) steel pipes can replace the {{conventional}} off-line heat treatment process {{and become an}} important and critical procedure. The OSWC process improves production efficiency, decreases costs, and enhances the mechanical properties of ERW steel pipe, especially the impact properties of the weld joint. In this paper, an annular OSWC process is investigated based on an experimental simulation platform that can obtain precise real-time measurements of {{the temperature of the}} pipe, the water pressure and flux, etc. The effects of the modes of annular spray water cooling and related cooling parameters on the mechanical properties of the pipe are investigated. The temperature evolutions of the inner and outer walls of the pipe are measured during the spray water cooling process, and the uniformity of mechanical properties along the circumferential and longitudinal directions is investigated. A heat transfer coefficient model of spray water cooling is developed based on measured temperature data in conjunction with simulation using the finite element method. Industrial tests prove the validity of the heat transfer model of a steel pipe undergoing spray water cooling. The research results can provide a basis for the industrial application of the OSWC process in the production of ERW steel pipes...|$|R
