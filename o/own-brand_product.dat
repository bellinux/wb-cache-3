25|$|Various tactics {{adopted to}} work around {{inflation}} include decreasing the quantity of an item within a set (such as removing a pencil within a larger pack) to reduce the production costs and replacing third-party brands with their own-brand alternatives. Examples of branded products being replaced include After Eights and Toblerone, both being confectionery products. Poundland planned to launch a Toblerone replacement in July 2017, by offering a closely resembling <b>own-brand</b> <b>product</b> named Twin Peaks, though following a legal battle from Toblerone's manufacturer, the product had to be redesigned to be distinctly different. The retailer dismisses concerns about a weaker pound, as this reduces freight costs which counteracts the impact.|$|E

50|$|By {{the early}} part of the decade, it was evident that China would make the {{transition}} from a largely manufacturing economy to one with its own global brands. With the rise of Chinese companies such as Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo and Haier selling <b>own-branded</b> <b>products</b> into global markets, the priority for western companies shifted away from sourcing and manufacturing to getting their cutting-edge components, software and IP designed into the products of these Chinese brands. Intralink followed this trend by working with western companies to develop and execute their sales and licensing strategies for the China market.|$|R
50|$|Lindane {{was banned}} from use on crops destined for Co-op <b>own-brand</b> <b>products</b> in 1999 after {{mounting}} health concerns, {{ten years before}} it was outlawed under the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants. The Co-operative Food became the first supermarket (2003) to ban a number of toxic chemicals (but which were still legal in the UK) from its own brand range of household products including washing up liquid and fabric conditioners. After recognising the potential for bioaccumulation of the toxic chemicals used in manufacturing and agriculture, the group joined with the WWF-UK on a campaign called DETOX which called for research into new safer chemicals which do no bioaccumulate.|$|R
5000|$|In 1984-85 {{research}} {{commissioned by}} the Co-op showed that consumers had a preference for food labelling schemes which presented the content of fat, sugar and salt within a product as either [...] "high", [...] "medium" [...] or [...] "low". The Co-op implemented this labelling system on <b>own-brand</b> <b>products</b> the same year. Further research in 1993 suggested that many consumers were confused by the nutritional labelling schemes used at the time. Both of these findings were supported by evidence gathered by the Food Standards Agency in 2002 and the Institute for Grocery Distribution proposed a new labelling system based upon the guideline daily amount principle.|$|R
50|$|In 1994 The Co-operative Group began {{labelling}} own brands food {{which contained}} genetically modified (GM) ingredients and, five years later, they banned {{the use of}} GM ingredients in its <b>own-brand</b> <b>products</b> including GM animal feed. Since 2003 the Co-op has banned the growing of GM crops on their own land (at {{the time they were}} the largest lowland UK farming business). The group also published a report on genetic modification which suggested that the majority of customers and members did not support GM crops. In 2013 the Co-op dropped its objection to GM chicken and turkey feed and allowed its suppliers to use such feeds, owing to the increasing difficulty in sourcing guaranteed non-GM feeds.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{integration}} of the CRS and CWS into the new Group structure it became evident that the business required significant modernisation and rationalisation of its businesses. The Co-operative Group followed by selling its loss-making footwear and milk processing businesses as well as some aspects of its agricultural production. The business also sold many of its larger supermarkets and hypermarkets using the funds to expand further into the convenience store sector, notably through adding 600 stores, following the acquisition of the Alldays chain. Alldays had previously purchased the VG chain of small supermarkets, which operated a franchise operation, supplying marketing and <b>own-brand</b> <b>products</b> to independently owned grocers. The Co-op's distribution facilities were significantly invested in, notably by opening a purpose built National Distribution Centre in Coventry during 2006.|$|R
5|$|The town {{is still}} largely {{dependent}} on industry, {{along with the}} neighbouring towns Taunton and Bridgwater with manufacturing industries identified within the county economic strategy as key centres for further economic development, due to good transport links. Swallowfield plc benefited from the growth of <b>own-brand</b> <b>products</b> during the 1970s and now produces aerosol, cosmetic and toiletry products. It was founded in 1876 as Walter Gregory & Co Ltd who manufactured animal husbandry products. The company diversified and in 1950 produced the first commercial aerosols in the UK which were basically farm products, air fresheners and insecticides. Bed manufacturers Relyon employ some 400 people. The company started in 1858 as a wool merchant, Price Brothers and Co., but the business soon moved into manufacturing beds and in 1935 {{changed its name to}} Relyon Ltd. In 2001 it was acquired by Steinhoff International Holdings Ltd., a quoted South African group.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} consistency {{levels of}} nutrition labelling on supermarket websites. Design: This is a comparative, quantitative study examining page position, content {{and design of}} nutrition labels on <b>own-brand</b> and branded <b>products.</b> Online and in-store nutrition labels were examined, categorised and analysed to discern variety of label designs used and consistency between online and in-store labelling. Setting: Five large online food retailers in the UK. Subjects Nutrition labels displayed on 100 webpages were examined for twenty branded and <b>own-brand</b> <b>products.</b> Equivalent labels on in-store packaged products were also examined. Results: Eight different combinations of nutrition label designs were found. The online supermarket sites were found to use from three to six of these label combinations across the sample. The consistency level between online and in-store package labels ranged from 25 % to 90 %. In many cases the nutrition label required scrolling to view and in all cases items could be purchased without the label being visible from the search result listings. Conclusions: The main recommendation of the paper is that online nutrition labelling needs {{to be much more}} consistently presented than is currently practised, both within each website and between online and in-store experiences. Particular attention should be made to polychrome colour and the inclusion of summary graphics. Designers should also ensure visibility of the label and raise its vertical page position. The paper also proposes additional expansion of the use of nutrition information online, using nutrition values as database fields in search criteria and checkout aggregation reporting...|$|R
2500|$|In April 2006, Asda {{launched}} a new trial format called 'Asda Essentials' in a former Co-op store in Northampton, followed by another in Pontefract a month later. This was the old Kwik-Save building for Pontefract. The stores were modelled on France's Leader Price chain, with a smaller floorplate than Asda's mainstream stores and with a primary focus on <b>own-brand</b> <b>products,</b> only stocking branded items that were perceived {{to be at the}} [...] "core" [...] of a family's weekly shop with the aim being to challenge the dominance of Tesco and Sainsbury's in the convenience store market {{while at the same time}} addressing competition from discount supermarkets such as Aldi, Lidl and Netto. On 6 December 2006, The Guardian newspaper reported that further planned store openings were under review following poor sales in the existing outlets, while the range of branded products being carried was also being expanded due to customer demand. In January 2007 it was announced that the original trial store would close within a month after only 10 months of trading. The Pontefract store continues to trade and is now part of the Asda supermarket division.|$|R
5000|$|As a {{consequence}} of this research, the Co-op trialled a new greatly extended labelling format which went above the legal requirement for what should be included at the time (energy, protein, carbohydrate, of which sugars, fat, of which saturates, fibre and sodium) by including reference values for [...] "guideline daily amounts", displaying whether each item constitutes [...] "high", [...] "medium" [...] or [...] "low", providing information regarding recommended quantities of fruit and vegetables, using the word [...] "calories" [...] rather than [...] "energy" [...] and for displaying [...] "salt" [...] rather than [...] "sodium". Overall this new design was endorsed by 89% of those customers asked. As {{a part of this}} change, the Co-op was also the first to introduce a graphic on the front of all <b>own-brand</b> <b>products</b> which highlighted the key nutritional information. The choice of the word [...] "salt" [...] over [...] "sodium" [...] was made because their research suggested that most consumers did not understand {{the difference between the two}} words and hence significantly underestimated the salt content of processed foods. Because of this, the Co-op also called for the government to legislate so that salt rather than sodium should be displayed on the packing of products.|$|R
40|$|A network {{structure}} {{is becoming an}} omnipresent determinant {{in the organization of}} social and economic life. In a sense, a network outlines, encompasses, structures, and arranges the space of data, information, services, goods, things and people, and how they flow. However, a network is not able (neither is its aim) to organize a given space in the traditional, vertical arrangement. It is not an equivalent of flat structures, either; it is rather an energy and information entity applied in a given space (the territory, the area, the logistics of an enterprise) which, by playing on continuities and non-continuities, accelerates the exchange and commercialization of ideas (innovations, research, cooperation, joint services, projects and ventures). In the era of the multiplication of various network entities, it is more and more difficult to identify them, e. g. according to the criteria of key values. In addition, we more and more often deal with the phenomenon of pullulating overlapping pervasion, a takeover and interference of networks which for an average citizen gives a very blurred picture of reality (e. g. Tesco, IKEA, OBI, Kaufland; and their <b>own-brand</b> <b>products</b> which do not have the name of an individual manufacturer). This paper has the model character and presents a model of a Knowledge-based Opole Tourism Cluster (OKTW) as a network proposal for arranging the “knowledge-based” space of the Opole region in Poland. So far it hasn’t been possible to do empirical researches because OKTW is {{still in the process of}} creation...|$|R
40|$|The article {{proposes a}} {{conceptual}} framework for analyzing the key drivers for retailers’ transport demand more systematically. Certainly, {{a better understanding of}} the reasons behind the growth in transport demand is crucial in formulating effective measures to manage and reduce emissions. Regarding to retailer-led supply chains, analyzing the retailers’ transport demand and its key drivers seems to be indispensable. This issue is even more important on an urban scale as retailers have a high share of urban freight transport. The authors’ main assumption is that retailers’ transport strategies are dependent to non-transport-related context, both internally to the non-transport strategies and also externally to the company’s environment. A classification of the context in three layers is suggested: • The macro-context represents retailers’ upstream context which includes the competitive and regulatory framework of retail industry, as well as consumers’ consumption patterns. • The meso context refers to the retailer’s sectorial dynamic. It includes aspects such as the vertical integration of wholesale stage or new relationships with suppliers e. g. through the development of <b>own-brand</b> <b>products</b> • The micro context is related to the strategy of the individual retailer and encompasses economic strategies (type of retail format, marketing area etc.). Furthermore, the paper illustrates the chains of interdependencies between different layers of context and their consequences for logistics and transport organization, using the example of food retailers in France and Germany. As one result, the influence of retailers’ sales related strategies on logistics and transport can be demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Food regime theory focuses {{upon the}} dynamics, and agents, {{of change in}} {{capitalist}} food and farming systems. Its exponents {{have been able to}} identify relatively stable periods of capital accumulation in the agri-food industries, along with the periods of transition. Recently, scholars have argued that—following a first food regime based upon colonial trade in bulk commodities like wheat and sugar, and a second food regime typified by industrial agriculture and manufactured foods—there is an emerging third food regime. This new regime is one that is lead by global corporations that are profiting from the re-organisation of agri-food chains. The delivery of ‘fresh/healthy’ foods is one manifestation; another is the sale, by supermarkets, of ready-meals and other <b>own-brand</b> <b>products.</b> This paper argues that behind the movement to a putative Third Food Regime are changes to the financial system. ‘Financialisation’—the increased influence of finance capital on the agri-food system—not only provides new opportunities for profit-making by hedge funds and private equity consortia, but also creates a situation in which agrifood companies, including food manufacturers, international commodity traders and supermarkets, may benefit. Supermarkets for example, are moving into banking, and are altering their role as they move from being retailers of products, into the provision of capital. Food regime theory needs to consider what lies ‘behind’ the transformation of food and fibre production, to examine not only the role of finance capital in re-shaping relations up and down the agri-food supply chain, but also investigating the tendency for agri-food capitals to seek profits from financial transactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the impact of the current economic recession on own-brand ranges in the Irish grocery retail sector. With the recession continuing to effect individuals daily lifestyles across the globe, retailers can expect to see more consumers switching to <b>own-branded</b> <b>products.</b> Consumer’s weekly incomes have decreased and are continuing to do so. Consumer’s are now seeking ways to save money during the recession, not alone on price, but on quality of offering. Evidence suggests that today's own-brands are better than yesterdays packaged goods. The study is entirely exploratory in nature. The research techniques employed is semistructured in-depth interviews with Managers in Head Office of Musgrave’s and Tesco Ireland. Qualitative questionnaires were conducted both face-to-face and via the telephone with Store Managers from four credible Irish Retailers operating in Ireland, SuperValu, Dunnes Stores, Centra and Tesco (the method by which to conduct the questionnaires depended on Manager preference). In addition to the research five focus groups with consumers were constructed and a small scale in-store observation study was also conducted to gain further insights and perceptions for the research. The research findings demonstrate that the recession has had a desirable impact on retailer own-brand sales. Findings indicate that own-brands have become the main priority for retailers now in these tougher economic times. From a consumer point of view the research findings illustrates that the recession has had a huge effect on consumer’s perceptions of and purchasing behaviours of own-brands. This research concludes that own-brands are excellent for increasing market share, differentiating a retailers brand and winning back consumers. Therefore retailers need to constantly invest and nourish their own-brand ranges. Own-brands have become a major growing consumer acceptance. With many consumers struggling financially, the own-brand ranges have become to be an excellent way of providing consumers with cheaper alternative products, without compromising on quality...|$|R
