The {{physical and mental health}} status in past 30  days were continuous measures (number of days) comprising two questions: “Thinking <b>of</b> <b>your</b> physical <b>health,</b> which includes physical illness and injury, for how many days during the past 30  days was <b>your</b> physical <b>health</b> not good?” and “Thinking <b>of</b> <b>your</b> mental <b>health,</b> which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30  days was <b>your</b> mental <b>health</b> not good?” Knowledge of the available health services was measured by the question, “In general, how would you rate <b>your</b> knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>health</b> services that are available to you?” (coded 1 [*]=[*]poor, 4 [*]=[*]excellent). Utilization of healthcare services was measured by the question, “Have you personally received any health care services in Alberta in the past 12 months?” (coded 0 [*]=[*]no, 1 [*]=[*]yes).|$|R
