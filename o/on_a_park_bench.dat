500|$|... "Baby Don't Cry" [...] {{was used}} as the theme song for the Japanese {{television}} drama series, Himitsu no Hanazono (2007). Alongside this, it was included in three Japanese commercials: the Avex Trax [...] "Myu-Umo" [...] music commercial, the Pokemero Joysound commercial, and for the Fuji TV television series, Secret Garden. An accompanying music video was shot in Japan by Masashi Muto. It opens with Amuro running on outdoor steps, and walking along a pavement bridge. As the chorus starts, intercut scenes of trees are shown, as she walks through the city. The second verse has her walking through a park, with yellow-ish leaves on the ground. She witnessed two small children <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>park</b> <b>bench,</b> holding the chain to a dog. The third chorus then has her walking through a city square, and ends with her standing on a beach front at sunset. A short version of the video was uploaded on Amuro's YouTube page on November 16, 2011, whilst a full version was uploaded one month later.|$|E
500|$|Bookends {{contains}} many of Paul Simon's major themes, including [...] "youth, alienation, life, love, disillusionment, relationships, old age, and mortality". Simon's work on Bookends is loosely autobiographical, designed {{to function as}} both a personal and artistic statement. Simon, [...] "feeling especially auteurist in the Dylan style of the day", had planned out the album's concept before he began writing, telling Garfunkel [...] "I'm going to start writing a whole side of an album—a cycle of songs. I want the early ones to be about youth and the last song to be about old age, and I want the feel of each song to fit." [...] Bookends, originally released primarily as a vinyl LP, opens and closes side one of the disc with the [...] "Bookends Theme", a brief acoustic piece (once compared to English rock band the Moody Blues) that evokes [...] "a time of innocence". [...] "Save the Life of My Child" [...] is a dramatic story involving drugs, violence and a mother and child relationship. According to James Bennighof, the song [...] "deals with individual crises in crowded urban settings, along with references to larger societal forces {{and at least a}} hint of some transcendent perspective". The song crossfades into [...] "America", which follows two young lovers—"an apparently impromptu romantic traveling alliance"—as they board a Greyhound bus [...] "to look for America". It is a protest song that [...] "creates a cinematic vista that tells of the singer's search for a literal and physical America that seems to have disappeared, along with the country's beauty and ideals". [...] "Overs" [...] includes themes regarding the disintegration of love and marriage. [...] "Old Friends" [...] paints a portrait of two old men reminiscing on the years of their youth. The two men [...] "sit <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>park</b> <b>bench</b> like bookends", and ponder how strange it feels to be nearing their lifetime. The song is joined with the [...] "Bookends Theme", this time with vocal accompaniment from the duo. The piece closes the entire suite with the [...] "resigned admonition" [...] to [...] "Preserve your memories / They're all that's left you".|$|E

50|$|In October 1943 he {{was taken}} with {{thirteen}} other men to the Toulouse train station {{en route to the}} Atlantic coast to build fortifications. At this layover he spent hours to bend the bars, then climbed out of the train window and escaped into the city of Toulouse. In Toulouse his friend Manfred sent a third set of false papers, this time under the name Max Henri Lefevre. Bretholz joined the Jewish Resistance Group Compagnons De France, known as “La Sixieme” so he could travel freely throughout France. He was assigned to Limoges, a city in south-central France. On May 8, 1944, his hernia ruptured and he collapsed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Limoges <b>park</b> <b>bench</b> and was sent by a passerby to a hospital, where he had surgery.

The Weezer blog stated that it should not be considered official: [...] "Note that while this [...] 'THE' music video for 'Greatest Man' - it's 'a' music video - [...] nonetheless very cool indeed!" [...] However, Weezer did film a video for the song through MTV, when they were selected as the MTV Artist of the Week.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to painting portraits and full-length figurative works, [...] Chase began painting landscapes in earnest {{in the late}} 1880s. His interest in landscape art may have been spawned by the landmark New York exhibit of French impressionist works from Parisian dealer Durand-Ruel in 1886. Chase is best remembered for two series of landscape subjects, both painted in an impressionist manner. The first was his scenes of Prospect and Central Parks in New York; the second were his summer landscapes at Shinnecock. Chase usually featured people prominently in his landscapes. Often he depicted woman and children in leisurely poses, relaxing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>park</b> <b>bench,</b> on the beach, or lying in the summer grass at Shinnecock. The Shinnecock works in particular {{have come to be}} thought of by art historians as particularly fine examples of American Impressionism.|$|E

2500|$|Gould was {{averse to}} cold and wore heavy {{clothing}} (including gloves), even in warm places. He was once arrested, presumably {{mistaken for a}} vagrant, while sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>park</b> <b>bench</b> in Sarasota, Florida, dressed in his standard all-climate attire of coat(s), hat and mittens. He also disliked social functions. He hated being touched, and in later life he limited personal contact, relying on the telephone and letters for communication. On one visit to Steinway Hall in New York City in 1959, the chief piano technician at the time, William Hupfer, greeted Gould by giving him {{a slap on the}} back. Gould was shocked by this, and complained of aching, lack of coordination, and fatigue because of the incident. He went on to explore the possibility of litigation against Steinway & Sons if his apparent injuries were permanent. He was known for cancelling performances at the last minute, which is why Bernstein's above-mentioned public disclaimer opens with, [...] "Don't be frightened, Mr. Gould is here... will appear in a moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Panahi's second {{feature film}} was The Mirror, {{produced}} by Rooz Films. Initially Panahi {{was going to}} direct Kiarostami's script for Willow and Wind, but he decided to pursue his own work instead. Panahi was inspired to make the film when while attending the 1996 Pusan International Film Festival in South Korea he noticed a young girl sitting alone <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>park</b> <b>bench</b> staring blankly into space, and {{realized that he had}} seen this same thing countless times in Iran and never paid attention to it. He has stated that he [...] "choose a precocious child and placed her in a situation where she is left to her own devices. Everyone she meets on her journey is wearing a mask or playing a role. I wanted to throw these masks away." [...] The film stars Mina Mohammadkhani, the sister of Aida Mohammadkhani. In the film Mohammadkhani could be said to play two characters: the role of a little girl named Baharan and then herself as the film shifts into a documentary mode. Panahi reported casting her after having detected [...] " [...] a feeling of emptiness within her, and a determination to prove herself to the world." [...] It received the Golden Leopard Award at the Locarno Film Festival, the Special Jury Award and Best Director Award at the 1998 Singapore International Film Festival, the Golden Tulip Award at the 1998 Istanbul Film Festival, the FIPRESCI Prize and the Eisenstein Magical Crystal and Cash Award at the 1998 Riga International Film Festival, and Buñuel's Golden Era Award at the Royal Archive Film Festival in Belgium.|$|E
