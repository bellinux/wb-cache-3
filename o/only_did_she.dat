Although the studio was looking for a film star in the role, director Kevin Lima insisted on casting a lesser-known actress.

[...] Hailing from Andalasia, Giselle displays similar traits to the Disney Princesses; Lima describes her as [...] "about 80% Snow White, with some traits borrowed from Cinderella and Princess Aurora from Sleeping Beauty... although her spunkiness comes from Princess Ariel from The Little Mermaid." [...] She is [...] "eternally optimistic and romantic" [...] but is also [...] "very independent and true to her convictions".

She pays particular attention in Palmetto Leaves to hunters who shoot at anything they see. Not taking offense at hunting for the sake of eating, Stowe laments killing for its own sake: [...] "it must be something that enjoys and can suffer; something that loves life, and must lose it". In 1877 she followed her book with a pamphlet that urged the cessation of the slaughter of Florida's wading birds, whose feathers were selling at the price of gold and used in women's hats.|$|E
