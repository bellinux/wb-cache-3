He returns {{to the idea that}} {{theology}} and mystical philosophies (he gives the examples of Vedanta, Spinoza, Hegel, and Bradley) will always contain contradictions. Known as the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mystery</b> <b>of</b> God, he maintains this is because the intellect is inherently incapable of understanding the Ultimate. All attempts to state the nature of the ultimate necessarily produce contradictions.|$|E

25|$|The two Marian dogmas of Immaculate Conception and Assumption were {{established}} by popes in the 19th and 20th century. Pope Pius XII issued the Dogma of the Assumption and the Second Vatican Council declared Mary {{to be the}} Mother of the Church. In his 2002 Apostolic Letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae, Pope John Paul II emphasized Saint Louis de Montfort's approach of viewing the study of Mary as a path to gaining a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>of</b> Christ.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the practice of invoking the aid of the Mother of Christ had become more familiar to the faithful some time before any expression of it in the writings of the Early Church Fathers. Christians' love for Mary intuited, frequently in anticipation, certain aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>of</b> the Blessed Virgin, calling the attention of theologians and pastors to them. Venerative and devotional practices have often preceded formal theological declarations by the Magisterium.|$|E

25|$|Holy Week is also {{observed}} {{in parts of}} Southern Italy, notably Sicily.

5|$|Some aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> <b>of</b> Isis and <b>of</b> other <b>mystery</b> cults, {{particularly}} {{their connection}} with the afterlife, resemble important elements <b>of</b> Christianity. <b>The</b> question <b>of</b> whether <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> influenced Christianity is controversial and the evidence is unclear; some scholars today attribute the similarities to a shared cultural background rather than direct influence. In contrast, Apuleius's account has had direct effects in modern times. Through his description <b>of</b> them, <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> <b>of</b> Isis have influenced many works of fiction and modern fraternal organizations, {{as well as a}} widespread, though false, belief that the ancient Egyptians themselves had an elaborate system <b>of</b> <b>mystery</b> initiations.|$|R
500|$|By far {{the most}} famous of Josquin's masses using the technique, {{and one of the most}} famous mass {{settings}} of the entire era, was the Missa pange lingua, based on the hymn by Thomas Aquinas for the Vespers of Corpus Christi. It was probably the last mass that Josquin composed. This mass is an extended fantasia on the tune, using the melody in all voices and in all parts of the mass, in elaborate and ever-changing polyphony. One of the high points of the mass is the et incarnatus est section of the Credo, where the texture becomes homophonic, and the tune appears in the topmost voice; here the portion which would normally set [...] "Sing, O my tongue, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>of</b> the divine body" [...] is instead given the words [...] "And he became incarnate by the Holy Ghost from the Virgin Mary, and was made man." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great". He referred to [...] "Mars, Bars" [...] {{as one of the}} finest episodes of season three, praising the Valentine's Day subplot, the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>of</b> Dean O'Dell's death, and Muhney's performance. Regarding Logan, he opined that although he did not like him moping after his breakup with Veronica, this episode fixed that by including him in the Valentine's Day subplot and setting up a romantic relationship with Parker: [...] "it's just a huge relief to see Logan in a different light and interacting with different people, finally." [...] He also praised Lamb's death scene as being devoid of clichés by not giving him an act of heroism for his dying moments. Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on his blog What's Alan Watching?, lauded the episode. He saw the episode and the previous episode as a return to form for Veronica Mars, writing, [...] "it's episodes like these last two that remind me of what this show looks like when it's really cooking." [...] He also enjoyed the lack of a redemptive moment for Lamb {{at the end of his}} life as well as the comedic value of some scenes in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Neither Ralph of Coggeshall nor William of Newburgh {{offer an}} {{explanation}} for the [...] "strange and prodigious" [...] event, as William calls it, and some modern historians have the same reticence: [...] "I consider the process of worrying over the suggestive details of these wonderfully pointless miracles in an effort to find natural or psychological explanations of what 'really,' if anything, happened, to be useless to the study of William of Newburgh or, for that matter, of the Middle Ages", says Nancy Partner, author of a study of 12th-century historiography. Nonetheless, such explanations continue to be sought and two approaches have dominated explanations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>of</b> the green children. The first is that the narrative descends from folklore, describing an imaginary encounter with the inhabitants of a [...] "fairy Otherworld". In a few early as well as modern readings, this other world is extraterrestrial, and the green children alien beings. The second {{is that it is a}} garbled account of a real event, although it is impossible to be certain whether the story as recorded is an authentic report given by the children or an [...] "adult invention". His study of accounts of children and servants fleeing from their masters led Charles Oman to conclude that [...] "there is clearly some mystery behind it all , some story of drugging and kidnapping". Jeffrey Jerome Cohen offers a different kind of historical explanation, arguing that the story is an oblique account of the racial difference between the contemporary English and the indigenous Britons.|$|E

2500|$|In Roman Catholic {{theology}} {{the study}} of Mary, while contributing to {{the study of}} Christ, is also a separate discipline in its own right, with an understanding of the figure of Mary contributing to a fuller understanding of who Christ is and what he did.
