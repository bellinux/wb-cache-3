5|$|Fearing the {{influence}} of French Revolutionary ideals, particularly those of philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Trimmer emphasized orthodox Anglicanism and encouraged the perpetuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> social and political order. Despite her conservatism, however, she agreed with Rousseau and other progressive educational reformers on many issues, such as the damaging effects of rote learning and the irrationalism of fairy tales.|$|E
5|$|Girl with Ball was {{exhibited}} at Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition and was displayed in Newsweek {{review of the}} show.

5|$|Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches {{is a book}} {{composed}} by the American folklorist Charles Godfrey Leland that was published in 1899. It contains what he believed was the religious text {{of a group of}} pagan witches in Tuscany, Italy that documented their beliefs and rituals, although various historians and folklorists have disputed the existence of such a group. In the 20th century, the book was very influential in the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> Pagan religion of Wicca. Aradia is also the name of a character in the webcomic Homestuck, created by Andrew Hussie.|$|E
5|$|Bregowine (died August 764) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of Canterbury. Little {{is known of}} his origins or his {{activities}} as archbishop, although a number of stories were told about his possible origins after the Norman conquest in 1066. There are no records of him prior to his becoming archbishop. He possibly owed his elevation to the Kentish monarch. The records after his elevation to Canterbury are mainly about disputes over land, but knowledge {{of his time in}} office is hampered by the destruction of many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> records. After his death, he was considered a saint and a life about him was written in the 12thcentury.|$|E

5|$|Given the chaos, the {{governor}} of Yunnan ignored the imperial orders of evacuation. The Mongol army commanded by Prince Ye-sin Timour, a grandson of the emperor, marched south toward Pagan. According to mainstream traditional (British colonial era) scholarship, the Mongol army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate; fought its way down to Pagan {{with the loss of}} 7000 men; occupied the city; and sent out detachments to receive homage, one of which reached south of Prome. But not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> Mongol/Chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of Pagan or the temporary completeness of the conquest.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, all of M-40 {{south of}} I-94 to Niles was reassigned the {{designation}} M-51 while M-40 was {{shifted to the}} east {{to take over the}} routing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> M-119 between Paw Paw and its intersection with US12 in Porter Township near Mottville. The routing of M-51 was extended down to the state line in April 1998 when US33 was decommissioned out of the state of Michigan; the extension formed a concurrency with Business US12 (Bus. US12) through Niles in the process. In early 2010, the central section of Bus. US12 was transferred to the City of Niles. In doing so, the Bus. US12 designation was decommissioned in the city, removing that designation from the M-51 concurrency.|$|E
5|$|Many of Daniel Libeskind's {{original}} concepts {{from the}} 2002 competition were discarded from the tower's final design. One World Trade Center's final design consisted of simple symmetries {{and a more}} traditional profile, intended to compare with selected elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> New York skyline. The tower's central spire draws from previous buildings, such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. It also visually resembles the original Twin Towers, rather than being an off-center spire similar to the Statue of Liberty.|$|E

However, none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> accounts of the actual landing makes any mention that the Rock was the specific place of landing.

5|$|Stokes {{returned}} from a European honeymoon in 1934, but she produced few works {{in the years immediately}} following. Although the Collins Street apartment had become a full-time studio for Stokes, only two paintings and two sketches from the period are known. The most notable is The Village (c.1933–1935), influenced, according to Stokes' own account, by the post-impressionist and portraitist Augustus John. This work was hung in the inaugural exhibition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Contemporary</b> Art Society, held at the National Gallery of Victoria. It was included in a travelling exhibition that appeared in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1941 and later in Canada. In 1946, Stokes presented the work to the National Gallery of Victoria.|$|E
5|$|The Bantu influx began around 500 BC, {{and some}} {{continued}} their migrations inside the territory {{well into the}} 20th century.

5|$|The Kingdom of the Picts {{as it was}} in {{the early}} 8th century, when Bede was writing, was largely the same as the kingdom of the Scots in the reign of Alexander I (1107–1124). However, by the tenth century, the Pictish kingdom was {{dominated}} by what we can recognise as Gaelic culture, and had developed a traditional story of an Irish conquest around the ancestor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> royal dynasty, Cináed mac Ailpín (Kenneth MacAlpin).|$|E
5|$|The Liber {{covers the}} period from the {{founding}} of the abbey in 673 until the middle of the 12th century, building on earlier historical works. It incorporates documents and stories of saints' lives. The work typifies a type of local history produced during {{the latter part of the}} 12th century. Similar books were written at other English monasteries. The longest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> local histories, the Liber chronicles the devastation that the Anarchy caused during the reign of King Stephen. It also documents the career of Nigel, the Bishop of Ely from 1133 to 1169, and his disputes with King Stephen. Other themes include the miracles worked by the monastery's patron saint, Æthelthryth, and gifts of land to Ely.|$|E
