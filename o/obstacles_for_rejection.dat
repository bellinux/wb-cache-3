40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Definition of {{individual}} risk profile {{is the first}} step to implement strategies to keep the delicate balance between under- and overimmunosuppression after kidney transplantation. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS We used data from the Efficacy Limiting Toxicity Elimination Symphony Study (1190 patients between 2002 and 2004) to model risk of rejection and infection in the first year after kidney transplantation. External validation was performed in a study population from the Fixed-Dose Concentration-Controlled Trial (630 patients between 2003 and 2006). RESULTS Despite different temporal dynamics, rejections and severe infections had similar overall incidences in the first year after transplantation (23. 4 % and 25. 5 %, respectively), and infections were the principal cause of death (43. 2 % of all deaths). Recipient older age, deceased donor, higher number of HLA mismatches, and high risk for cytomegalovirus disease were associated with infection; deceased donor, higher number of HLA mismatches, and immunosuppressive therapy including cyclosporin A (compared with tacrolimus), with rejection. These factors were integrated into a two-dimensional risk stratification model, which defined four risk groups: low risk <b>for</b> infection and <b>rejection</b> (30. 8 %), isolated risk <b>for</b> <b>rejection</b> (36. 1 %), isolated risk for infection (7. 0 %), and high risk <b>for</b> infection and <b>rejection</b> (26. 1 %). In internal validation, this model significantly discriminated the subgroups in terms of composite end point (low risk for infection/rejection, 24. 4 %; isolated risk <b>for</b> <b>rejection</b> and isolated risk for infection, 31. 3 %; high risk for infection/rejection, 54. 4 %; P< 0. 001), rejection episodes (isolated risk for infection and low risk for infection/rejection, 13. 0 %; isolated risk <b>for</b> <b>rejection</b> and high risk for infection/rejection, 24. 2 %; P= 0. 001), and infection episodes (low risk for infection/rejection and isolated risk <b>for</b> <b>rejection,</b> 12. 0 %; isolated risk for infection and high risk for infection/rejection, 37. 6 %; P< 0. 001). External validation confirmed the applicability of the model to an independent cohort. CONCLUSIONS We propose a two-dimensional risk stratification model able to disentangle the individual risk <b>for</b> <b>rejection</b> and infection in the first year after kidney transplantation. This concept can be applied to implement a personalized immunosuppressive and antimicrobial treatment approach...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Aiming at {{improving}} {{the reliability of}} a recognition system, this paper presents a novel SVM-based rejection measurement (SVMM) and voting based combination methods of multiple classifier system (MCS) <b>for</b> pattern <b>rejection.</b> Compared with the previous heuristic designed criteria, SVMM is more straight-forward and can make use of much more information from the training data. The voting based combination methods <b>for</b> <b>rejection</b> is a preliminary attempt to adopt MCS <b>for</b> <b>rejection.</b> Comparison of SVMM with other wellknown rejection criteria proves that it achieves the highest performance. Two different methods (structural modification and dataset re-sampling) are used to build MCSs. The basic classifier is the convolution neural network (CNN) which has achieved promising performances in numerous applications. Rejection based on MCS is then evaluated on MNIST and CENPARMI digit databases. Specifically, different rejection criteria (FRM, FTRM and SVMM) are individually combined with MCS <b>for</b> pattern <b>rejection.</b> Experimental results indicate that these combinations improve the rejection performance consistently and MCS built by dataset re-sampling works better than that with structural modification in rejection. ...|$|R

40|$|One form of argument-based {{negotiation}} is when agents {{argue about}} why an offer was rejected.

Also, if a reason <b>for</b> <b>rejection</b> can be disputed, the negotiation process may be of higher quality since flawed reasons may be revised as a result. This paper presents a formal protocol for negotiation in which reasons can be asked and given <b>for</b> <b>rejections</b> and in which agents can try to persuade each other that a reason {{is or is not}} acceptable. The protocol is modelled as a persuasion dialogue game embedded in a negotiation protocol. It has a social semantics since the protocol does not refer to the internal state of negotiating agents...|$|R
