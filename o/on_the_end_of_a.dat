5|$|In 1966, a five-gondola {{train set}} with green-and-white-striped awnings and a five-gondola train set with blue-and-white-striped awnings, {{referred}} to by Disneyland employees as Holiday Green and Holiday Blue respectively, {{were added to the}} DRR's rolling stock. Both train sets had side-facing bench seating like the Holiday Red freight train. By the time that the new Holiday Green and Holiday Blue trains sets were introduced in 1966, the DRR's original roundhouse, located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spur line connected to the main line near the Rivers of America in the Frontierland section, had been replaced by a larger roundhouse, located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new spur line connected to the main line in the Tomorrowland section. The new roundhouse, where the DRR's locomotives and train cars are stored and maintained, was also built to house the storage and maintenance facility for the Disneyland Monorail.|$|E
5|$|Towel Power is a {{term used}} by the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL) to {{describe}} the waving of rally towels by their fans. The tradition started in the 1982 Campbell Conference Finals when Vancouver played the Chicago Blackhawks. During game two of the series, head coach Roger Neilson waved a white towel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hockey stick in a mock surrender after being upset with the officiating. Neilson was ejected and the Canucks lost 4–1. When Vancouver returned home from Chicago for the following game fans supported both Neilson and the Canucks by waving towels first at the airport when the team arrived and then during the next game. The Canucks won the next three games and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals where they were defeated by the New York Islanders. As part of the tradition, the Canucks hand out towels prior to playoff games for fans to help support the team.|$|E

25|$|The simple gravity {{pendulum}} is {{an idealized}} mathematical {{model of a}} pendulum. This is a weight (or bob) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> massless cord suspended from a , without friction. When given an initial push, it will swing back and forth at a constant amplitude. Real pendulums are subject to friction and air drag, so the amplitude of their swings declines.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of an object that is {{swinging}} around <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rope in a horizontal plane, the centripetal force on the object is supplied by the tension of the rope. The rope example is an example involving a 'pull' force. The centripetal force can also be supplied as a 'push' force, such as in the case where the normal reaction of a wall supplies the centripetal force for a wall of death rider.|$|E

25|$|To the Egyptians, {{the frog}} {{was a symbol}} of life and fertility, since {{millions}} of them were born after the annual flooding of the Nile, which brought fertility to the otherwise barren lands. Consequently, in Egyptian mythology, there began to be a frog-goddess, who represented fertility, named Heqet. Heqet was usually depicted as a frog, or a woman with a frog's head, or more rarely as a frog <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> phallus to explicitly indicate her association with fertility. A lesser known Egyptian god, Kek, was also sometimes shown {{in the form of a}} frog.|$|E
25|$|A {{bolas spider}} is any of {{several species of}} orb-weaver spider that, instead of {{spinning}} the typical web, hunt by using a sticky 'capture blob' of silk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> line, known as a 'bolas'. By swinging the bolas at flying male moths or moth flies nearby, the spider may snag its prey rather like a fisherman snagging a fish on a hook. Because of this, they are also called angling or fishing spiders (although the remotely related genus Dolomedes is also called a fishing spider). The prey is lured to the spider by the production of up to three pheromone-analogues.|$|E
25|$|The {{windows and}} {{front door of}} Bag End were round, a typical feature of hobbit-architecture. Its tunnels and rooms, also typically, were all built on one level. However, only lavish smials like Bag End had many rooms and cellars, with {{high-quality}} fixtures, fittings, and furniture. Its front door (on the south) and the porthole-like windows (all on the west) opened onto Bag End's lawns and gardens, the Party Field, and the distant countryside beyond. The main entrance sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gated path {{at the end of}} a lane leading from the Hill Road.|$|E

25|$|The side-float design uses a float <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lever {{to control}} the fill valve. The float is usually shaped like a ball, so the {{mechanism}} is called a ball-valve or a ballcock. Cock is a term for valve; see, for example, stopcock. The float was originally made from copper sheet, but it is now usually plastic. The float is located {{to one side of}} the main valve tower at the end of a rod or arm. As the side-float rises, so does the side-float-arm. The arm connects to the fill valve that blocks the water flow into the toilet tank, and thus maintains a constant level in the tank.|$|E
25|$|On 13 July, a {{crowd of}} Parisians {{occupied}} the Hôtel de Ville, and the Marquis de Lafayette organized the French National Guard to defend the city. On 14 July, a mob seized the arsenal at the Invalides, acquired thousands of guns, and stormed the Bastille, a prison that {{was a symbol of}} royal authority, but at that time held only seven prisoners. 87 revolutionaries were killed in the fighting. The governor of the Bastille, the Marquis de Launay, surrendered and then was killed, his head put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pike and carried around Paris. The provost of the merchants of Paris, Jacques de Flesselles, was also murdered. The fortress itself was completely demolished by November, and the stones turned into souvenirs.|$|E

Later on, Pennington completed 5/6 passes for 59 yards on a 74-yard drive, the last one a 3-yard touchdown toss to rookie tight end Chris Baker. Then on Indy's ensuing drive, Damien Robinson intercepted a pass from Manning and returned it 24 yards to the Colts 36-yard line. New York then drove 64 yards in 13 plays, 11 of them runs by Jordan for 59 yards, including a 1-yard touchdown run to make the final score of the game 41-0. Jets linebacker James Darling then put the finishing touches on the win by intercepting Manning's final pass of the game.|$|E

25|$|Japanese {{losses in}} Burma and India in 1944 had been catastrophic. They were made up with drafts of conscripts, {{many of whom}} were not of the best {{physical}} categories. Kimura's staff decreed that their divisions in Burma should have a strength of 10,000 (compared with their paper establishment of nearer 25,000), but most divisions mustered barely half this reduced strength. Furthermore, they lacked anti-tank weapons. To face massed Allied armour, they would be forced to deploy their field artillery in the front line, which would affect their ability to give concentrated fire support to the infantry. Expedients such as lunge mines (an explosive charge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> long pole), or suicide attacks by men wearing explosive charges, were not effective if the enemy tanks were closely supported by infantry.|$|E
25|$|With Wheater suspended, {{and both}} Taylor and Hoyte out injured, Middlesbrough had to field a patched-up back four for their home game versus Arsenal, with Tony McMahon {{returning}} to the starting line-up after a long time out with injuries, alongside Huth and Riggott, {{both of whom were}} returning from injury. There was also a start for Adam Johnson on the right hand side of midfield, as Alves was dropped to the bench. Emmanuel Adebayor put Arsenal into the lead after quarter of an hour, but Aliadière got <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wonderful cross from Tuncay to head home the equaliser twelve minutes later. The home side were then denied a penalty when Johnson was brought down in the box, but the referee didn't award anything. Both sides had further chances but the game ended 1–1.|$|E
25|$|The Harrow {{also served}} in a novel {{operational}} role {{at the height of}} the German night Blitz against Britain in the winter of 1940–1941. Six Harrows equipped No. 420 Flight RAF (later No. 93 Squadron RAF) which used lone Harrows to tow Long Aerial Mines (LAM) into the path of enemy bombers. The LAM had an explosive charge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> long cable and the unorthodox tactic was credited with the destruction of 4–6 German bombers. The experiment was judged of poor value and the planned deployment of Douglas Havocs in the LAM role was cancelled. Nine Harrows were also used by 782 Naval Air Squadron, Fleet Air Arm as transports. After flight refuelling trials, three Harrows were operated by Flight Refuelling Limited and refuelled Short Empire Flying Boats on transatlantic services, two from Gander, Newfoundland and one based in Foynes, Ireland. In 1940, the two aircraft based at Gander were impressed into service with the Royal Canadian Air Force.|$|E

25|$|The {{tensions}} {{quickly turned}} to violence. On 11 July 1789, {{soldiers of the}} Royal-Allemand regiment attacked a peaceful demonstration of Parisians protesting the dismissal of Necker on Place Louis XV (now Place de la Concorde. On 13 July, a mob of Parisians occupied the Hôtel de Ville, and the Marquis de Lafayette organized a Garde nationale to defend the city against the army. On 14 July, a mob seized the arsenal at the Invalides, acquiring thousands of guns, and stormed the Bastille, a symbol of royal authority, a prison {{which at the time}} held only seven prisoners, and was defended by eighty invalid soldiers, reinforced by thirty-six Swiss guards. About forty Revolutionaries were killed in the fighting. The governor of the Bastille, the Marquis de Launay, surrendered and then was killed, and his head put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pike and carried around Paris. The Provost of the merchants of Paris, Jacques des Fleselles, was also murdered, and his head paraded around the city.

25|$|D.C.'s homestand {{continued}} with a match against the Eastern Conference leading Philadelphia Union. United {{took the lead}} when Kemp intercepted a pass in the defensive end, raced through the Union defense and beat the goalie to the far post. However, the Union tied the game on a free kick just before halftime. The visitors took the lead when Acosta was dispossessed {{as he tried to}} dribble out of the defensive end and former United star Chris Pontius continued a remarkable renaissance in his first season away from D.C. and put the Union ahead. United's coach, Ben Olsen was ejected late in the second half for protesting one of many uncalled fouls on Acosta. Despite missing their leader, United pushed hard for a tying goal. Despite having a couple of apparent goals waved off by the officials, the team finally found the tying goal in the fourth minute of stoppage time, when Birnbaum got his head <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> service into the box by Nyarko. Despite being only a draw, it was a very emotional goal for the players and fans, but the home draw meant the team remained outside of playoff contention.|$|E
25|$|The {{month of}} May began with United playing their 5th game in 18 days {{and with a}} back line that had one healthy centerback, Brandon McDonald. The other centerbacks, Emiliano Dudar, Dejan Jakovic and Ethan White, were all out due to injuries. Playing the hottest team in the league, the San Jose Earthquakes, the defenseless United {{surrendered}} 5 goals in a 5-3 defeat. The game started well for United with a goal by Dwayne De Rosario in the eighth minute. However, the disorganized United defense gave up three goals in a flurry before halftime, on goals by Chris Wondolowski, Steven Lenhart and Justin Morrow. United drew close, when Daniel Woolard scored a diving header in the 64th minute. San Jose soon pulled away as Wondowlowski and Lenhart each scored their second goal of the game. Although the game was out of reach, United fans were buoyed with a late goal by substitute Hamdi Salihi, in the 88th minute. Salihi, United's much-hyped offseason signing, scored {{for the first time}} in league play, when he got <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> long pass by De Rosario, and neatly chipped it over the diving San Jose goalie, Jon Busch.|$|E
