5|$|Historian Sandra Mass {{considers}} the Rommel myth a hero cult, {{a synthesis of}} old and new hero cults and traditions culled primarily from Germany's largely imaginary colonial past, in particular the proletarian hero cult originally represented by Carl Peters and the bourgeois one represented by Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. Rommel, as portrayed by this hero cult, was both chivalrous and ruthless, young and old, harsh and gentle, strong and righteous. Calder, Duffy and Ricci <b>opine</b> that Rommel's military brilliance provoked a masochistic tendency to romanticise a worthy opponent, that because he was skilled at his profession, he must have been an anti-Nazi hero.|$|E
40|$|We present here a {{reliable}} and sensitive method for the determination of acidic <b>opines</b> such as meso-alanopine, beta-alanopine, tauropine and strombine in biological samples. Interfering primary amino acids were eliminated by reaction with o-phthalaldehyde, and the derivatized compounds were passed through Sep-Pak Plus PS- 1 cartridges. The acidic <b>opines</b> were recovered by flushing the cartridges with water, then determined by high performance liquid chromatography after a second derivatization with phenylisothiocyanate. All 4 acidic <b>opines</b> were detected within 30 min. This method ensured good separation and guaranteed almost full recovery of all acidic <b>opines.</b> This method was applied to analyze <b>opines</b> in marine animals and to test whether <b>opines</b> are metabolized in the livers of the rat and fish. </p...|$|R
40|$|Three {{genes from}} the TR region of pTi 15955 were {{introduced}} into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) {{to direct the}} synthesis of the mannityl <b>opines</b> from hexose sugars and glutamine or glutamate. <b>Opines</b> were present in all tissue types tested and accumulated to levels of 100 to 150 micrograms per milligram dry weight in root, stem, and leaf tissues. Opine-producing plants appeared normal with respect to morphology and development. Transgenic plants grown for 60 days under sterile autotrophic conditions produced up to 540 micrograms of the mannityl <b>opines</b> per milligrams dry weight of tissue as root exudates. <b>Opines</b> were also detected in leaf and seed washes from soil-grown plants...|$|R
40|$|Conjugal {{transfer}} of the Ti plasmids from Agrobacterium tumefaciens is controlled by autoinduction via the transcriptional activator TraR and the acyl-homoserine lactone ligand, Agrobacterium autoinducer (AAI). This control process is itself regulated by <b>opines,</b> which are small carbon compounds produced by the crown gall tumors that are induced by the bacteria. <b>Opines</b> control autoinduction by regulating the expression of traR. Transfer of pTiC 58 from donors grown with agrocinopines A and B, the conjugal <b>opines</b> for this Ti plasmid, was detected only after the donors had reached a population level of 107 cells per cm 2. Donors incubated with the <b>opines</b> and AAI transferred their Ti plasmids at population levels about 10 -fold lower than those incubated with <b>opines</b> only. Transcription of the tra regulon, as assessed by monitoring a traA::lacZ reporter, showed a similar dependence on {{the density of the}} donor population. However, even in cultures at low population densities that were induced with <b>opines</b> and AAI, there was a temporal lag of between 15 and 20 h in the development of conjugal competence. Moreover, even after this latent period, maximal transfer frequencies required several hours to develop. This lag period was independent of the population density of the donors but could be reduced somewhat by addition of exogenous AAI. Quorum-dependent development of conjuga...|$|R
5|$|Some {{historian}}s <b>opine</b> that Hitler {{would have}} assumed Stefanie was of Jewish origin. American historian Graeme Donald believes Hitler would have inferred {{that she was}} Jewish, but saw no problems with this at the time. This view is supported by German historian Anton Joachimsthaler, who stated in a BBC interview that Hitler must have assumed she was Jewish because of her Jewish surname. British singer-songwriter, author, journalist and paranormal researcher Paul Roland wrote in his book Nazi Women that it didn't make the slightest difference to Hitler whether she was Jewish or not.|$|E
5|$|In the Fourth Test at Headingley, England batted {{first on}} a pitch {{regarded}} as being ideal for strokeplay, and Australia's bowlers had little {{success on the}} first day. Early in the day, Johnston appeared to be having back problems. He had bowled the most overs of any bowler on the tour and his loss would have meant a heavy workload for his remaining colleagues. His apparent discomfort led onlookers to <b>opine</b> {{that he should have}} been given more rest in the county matches. After an opening partnership of 143, England consolidated to reach 1/268 in the last over of the day before Johnston removed Washbrook for 143. Johnston did not taste further success in the first innings and ended with 1/86 from 38 overs as the home team ended on 496, their highest score of the series.|$|E
5|$|Others like Stroud, Krause and Phillips <b>opine</b> {{that even}} Rommel's {{recklessness}} and disobedience during {{the invasion of}} France benefitted the German cause, while rescuing Hitler's mercurial objectives and inventing the actual application of blitzkrieg ("lightning war"), and it was Hitler who downgraded strategic victory to operational victory. According to Alan J. Levine, contrary to the allegation {{that he was only}} a genius tactician without a good grasp of logistics, Rommel was a clearer thinker than most of his colleagues (shown by his judgements on developing situations), and although he was the most defeatist German general, there was a serious qualification to his pessimism and he was capable of displaying a surprising amount of energy in building the Normandy defense at the same time.|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} the uptake of [14 C]octopine and [14 C]nopaline by Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains containing the C 58 chromosomal background in medium suitable for the induction of vir genes. All strains tested could transport both of these <b>opines,</b> regardless of the presence or type of Ti plasmid (octopine or nopaline) present in the bacterium. The transport of these <b>opines</b> required active cellular metabolism. Nonradioactive octopine, nopaline, and arginine competed effectively with [14 C]octopine and [14 C]nopaline for transport into A. tumefaciens A 136, suggesting that the transport of these <b>opines</b> occurs via an arginine transport pathway not encoded by the Ti plasmid...|$|R
5|$|The Western Ganga {{administration}} {{was influenced by}} principles stated in the ancient text arthashastra. The praje gavundas mentioned in the Ganga records held responsibilities {{similar to those of}} the village elders (gramavriddhas) mentioned by Kautilya. Succession to the throne was hereditary but there were instances when this was overlooked. The kingdom was divided into Rashtra (district) and further into Visaya (consisting of possibly 1000 villages) and Desa. From the 8th century, the Sanskrit term Visaya was replaced by the Kannada term Nadu. Examples of this change are Sindanadu-8000 and Punnadu-6000, with scholars differing about the significance of the numerical suffix. They <b>opine</b> that it was either the revenue yield of the division computed in cash terms or the number of fighting men in that division or the number of revenue paying hamlets in that division or the number of villages included in that territory.|$|E
5|$|Æthelric was a monk at Christ Church Priory at Canterbury {{prior to}} his {{becoming}} a bishop. Several historians <b>opine</b> {{that he might have}} been the same as the Æthelric who was a monk of Canterbury and a relative of Godwin, Earl of Wessex. That Æthelric was elected by the monks of Canterbury to be Archbishop of Canterbury in 1050, but was not confirmed by King Edward the Confessor who insisted on Robert of Jumièges becoming archbishop instead. The evidence is not merely that they shared the same name, because the name was a relatively common one in Anglo-Saxon England. Other evidence pointing to the possibility of them being the same person includes {{the fact that he was}} felt to have been unfairly deposed in 1070 as well as the bishop's great age in 1076.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} play in the Lancashire League in England during the Australian winter of 1952, joining Nelson Cricket Club for a sum of 600 pounds and bonuses, which did not include the boat fares for him and his wife. Lindwall took 96 wickets at 8.37 during the season and developed an inswinger on the advice of a local umpire who adamantly refused to give leg before wicket decisions to outswingers. Lindwall returned to Australia with a newborn son who has been born during his stay in Lancashire, and he was greeted by media speculation as to whether his professional sojourn had improved or detracted from his capabilities. Lindwall's form leading into the Tests against South Africa in 1952–53 prompted observers to <b>opine</b> that he was bowling better than ever, reinforced with the inswinger and his trademark Yorker. Lindwall made 70 from a total of 148 on a sticky wicket against South Australia in Adelaide that led Miller to regard it as the best innings he had seen under such conditions. He made the score after being sent in to open the batting in the absence of Sid Barnes.|$|E

5|$|Some authors like Boog and Lewin <b>opine</b> {{that while}} Creveld's {{statistics}} regarding the losses of supplies are not wrong {{and that the}} vast distances were a big problem, {{the failure of the}} seaborne supply lines was still a deciding factor because operationally effective supplies often failed to arrive at decisive moments of the campaigns. Douglas Austin points out that the overall port capacity at Tobruk and Benghazi was actually sufficient and that the recently published Enigma intercepts show that it was the bulk losses at sea (and not unloading or getting the supplies to forward areas) that had the greater impact on Rommel's decisions {{as well as those of}} other German commanders, like Kesselring. Levine dismisses poor port capacity and lack of transport vehicles as the Afrika Korps' crucial weaknesses, citing evidences gathered on British intelligence by Hinsley and Bennett. Others point out Rommel's dependence on captured resources as compensation for the unstable supply lines and unfulfilled promises (by 1942, 85% of his transport were captured vehicles). Butler opines that the myth of Rommel's bad logistical management is the result of rumours started by Halder.|$|E
5|$|The {{applicant}} then {{appealed to}} the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal construed section 8B(1) {{in accordance with the}} clear legislative intention expressed through the plain wording of the provision. It held that the provision reinstates the legal position laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the law governing judicial review of decisions made or acts done pursuant to the executive's powers under the ISA. In order to determine the law on judicial review of the exercise of executive discretion under the ISA, it is necessary to ascertain the exact decision laid down in Lee Mau Seng. However, the Court declined to <b>opine</b> whether the Lee Mau Seng decision meant that a detention order cannot be challenged on the basis that it was made for reasons completely outside the scope of the ISA. This was because on {{the facts of the case}} it had not been established that the applicant was re-detained for reasons not contemplated by section 8(1) of the ISA and completely unrelated to national security. Notably, the Court did not decide whether section 8B(2) of the ISA precludes it from reviewing a detention order shown to have been made for purposes other than national security, or whether the 1989 amendments to the ISA are outside the scope of the legislative power conferred on Parliament by the amended Article 149 of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{contact between}} South India and Islam {{goes back to}} the 7th century, when trade between Hindu kingdoms and Islamic caliphates thrived. These Muslim traders settled on the Malabar Coast and married local Hindu women, and their {{descendants}} {{came to be known as}} Mappillas. By the 14th century, Muslims had become a significant minority in the south, though the advent of Portuguese missionaries checked their growth. Haider Ali, though a devout Muslim, did not allow his faith to interfere with the administration of the predominantly Hindu kingdom. Historians are, however, divided on the intentions of Haider Ali's son, Tipu Sultan. It has been claimed that Tipu raised Hindus to prominent positions in his administration, made generous grants to Hindu temples and brahmins, and generally respected other faiths, and that any religious conversions that Tipu undertook were as punishment to those who rebelled against his authority. However, this has been countered by other historians who claim that Tipu Sultan treated the non-Muslims of Mysore far better than those of the Malabar, Raichur and Kodagu regions. They <b>opine</b> that Tipu was responsible for mass conversions of Christians and Hindus in these regions, either by force or by offering them tax incentives and revenue benefits to convert.|$|E
