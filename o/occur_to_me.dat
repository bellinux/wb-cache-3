500|$|Regarding the record, Smith said: [...] "I {{thought my}} head would be chopped off {{immediately}} {{when it came}} out because {{at the time it was}} so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular... The thing is that album was really well received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed , unfortunately." [...] Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: [...] "The idea of playing [...] for people didn't <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>me...</b> because at the time it was the Northwest—Mudhoney and Nirvana—and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off." ...|$|E
500|$|Paranhos {{was left}} behind when Carneiro Leão {{returned}} to Brazil, having been named Brazil's diplomatic minister to Uruguay. Paranhos' time in Uruguay allowed him to acquire {{an understanding of the}} dynamics characterizing Hispanic American nations of the period. Intermittent crises leading to and resulting from coups, government by dictators, political factionalism and civil wars were commonplace among these countries. A penchant for, and skill in, diplomacy became evident during his stay—as a pleased Viscount of Uruguai, still Minister of Foreign Affairs, noted in February 1853: [...] "In a general manner, I approve of what our diplomatic representatives do; however, it almost always seems to me that, were I in their places, I would have done better. But with Dr. Paranhos that thought does not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Every time I read his communiqués, I tell myself: 'This is precisely what I would have done or said.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Partially {{due to her}} {{experiences}} filming Mermaids, Cher turned down leading roles in such films as The War of the Roses and Thelma & Louise. According to Berman, [...] "After the success of Moonstruck, she was so worried about her next career move that she was overly cautious." [...] In the early 1990s, she contracted the Epstein–Barr virus and developed chronic fatigue syndrome, which left her too exhausted to sustain her music and film careers. Because she needed to earn money and was not healthy enough to work on other projects, she starred in infomercials launching health, beauty, and diet products, which earned her close to $10million in fees. The skits were parodied on Saturday Night Live and critics considered them a sellout, many suggesting her film career was over. She told Ladies' Home Journal, [...] "Suddenly I became the Infomercial Queen and it didn't <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that people would focus on that and strip me of all my other things." ...|$|E

It stars himself, Emma Kennedy, Dan Tetsell and Christian Reilly and currently stands at 18 episodes and 5 bonus mini-episodes. It was nominated for best internet show at the 2010 Sony Awards, though it failed to place. On 7 February 2011, As It <b>Occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> won the first Chortle Internet award [...] On 20 March 2012 he retained it.

500|$|Feldman has {{admitted}} in several interviews {{that he has}} been the victim of people who email him to explain psychiatric symptoms, only to divulge eventually that they created it all to fool a doctor. For prolonged cases, he states the impetus for such behavior is the [...] "longing for nurturing, sympathy, care and concern that they feel unable to get in appropriate ways," [...] and that the admiration of forum members is a strong motivator to continue. As manipulation is integral to most cases, the need to control others to feel as if the perpetrator is in control {{of his or her own}} life is apparent, as is the pre-existence of underlying personality disorders. Many people who present factitious disorders crave sympathy and support because it was notably absent in childhood. In a story published in The Village Voice in 2001, a woman recovering from factitious disorder remembered her drive to create conditions that did not exist: [...] "When I'd do something to attract the paramedics and police, I got an adrenaline rush. I believe I got addicted to it. At the time, it didn't <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I was hurting anyone but myself." [...] A psychologist who was a member of the support group for premature infants stated in The New York Times article, [...] "People who do this need something. I wonder if it's a metaphor for some other loss she experienced and is playing over and over again in different shapes." ...|$|E
500|$|According to American critic Robert Christgau, Maxinquayes groove-oriented and low-tempo music drew {{not only}} on dub but also on lo-fi, ambient techno, and hip hop, while James Hunter from Rolling Stone said Tricky subsumed American hip hop, soul, reggae, and 1980s English rock sounds into [...] "a mercurial style of dance music". Entertainment Weekly critic David Browne {{classified}} the music as an intellectual form of R. Ben Walsh of The Independent called it an experimental album featuring a [...] "heady blend" [...] of soul, rock, punk, hip hop, dub, and electronica. In Tricky's own words, he composed his songs based on a particular sound he liked rather than having a definite song structure in mind: [...] "I couldn't write you a blues track or a hip-hop track if you asked. I just make what I hear and then me and Martina sing all the words on paper, putting {{the emphasis on the}} things that perhaps shouldn't be sung." [...] Tricky had no concept of pitch, regard for notational conventions and time signatures, or previous experience with sampling, but his approach for Maxinquaye challenged Saunders to rethink his ideas about music production and experiment in ways he had never tried before. Saunders recalled being asked to combine samples of two songs that were 30 beats per minute apart and composed in entirely different keys: [...] " [...] thought differently to anybody I've ever known ... It didn't <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that by de-tuning one to slow it down, both might then gel musically at that point. I always think of it like going into a scrapyard and building a car out of all the bits you can find. You could probably build a car that would work, and although it might be the ugliest you've ever seen, it would have loads of character." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....my Way is, {{to divide}} half a Sheet of Paper by a Line into two Columns, writing over the one Pro, {{and over the}} other Con.

When I have thus got them all together in one View, I endeavour to estimate their respective Weights; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem equal, I strike them both out: If I find a Reason pro equal to some two Reasons con, I strike out the three. If I judge some two Reasons con equal to some three Reasons pro, I strike out the five; and thus proceeding I find at length where the Ballance lies; and if after a Day or two of farther Consideration nothing new that is of Importance occurs on either side, I come to a Determination accordingly.|$|E

2500|$|Minor Threat's song [...] "Guilty of Being White" [...] {{led to some}} {{accusations of}} racism, but MacKaye has {{strongly}} denied such intentions and said that some listeners misinterpreted his words. He claims that his experiences attending Wilson High School, whose student population was 70 percent black, inspired the song. There, many students bullied MacKaye and his friends. Thrash metal band Slayer later covered the song, with the last iteration of the lyric [...] "Guilty of being white" [...] changed to [...] "Guilty of being right." [...] In an interview, MacKaye stated that he was offended that some perceived racist overtones in the lyrics, saying, [...] "To me, {{at the time and}} now, it seemed clear it's an anti-racist song. Of course, it didn't <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at the time I wrote it that anybody outside of my twenty or thirty friends who I was singing to would ever have to actually ponder the lyrics or even consider them." ...|$|E
