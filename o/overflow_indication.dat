40|$|The PCF 8593 is a CMOS 1 {{clock and}} {{calendar}} circuit, optimized for low power consumption. Addresses and data are transferred serially via the two-line bidirectional I 2 C-bus. The built-in word address register is incremented automatically after each written or read data byte. The built-in 32. 768 kHz oscillator circuit {{and the first}} 8 bytes of the RAM are used for the clock, calendar, and counter functions. The next 8 bytes can be programmed as alarm registers or used as free RAM space. 2.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The Sufri variety of date is widely cultivated in Saudi Arabia, where it 'produced large quantities of dates. The high quality dates are consumed fresh, dried or preserved, the surplus and second quality dates may be damaged by improper harvesting, handling, transporting and processing. The Sufri variety of date is one of moderate quality {{and there is a}} surplus in local markets for processing into overflows to be used as "a base" for the food industry. The present work was conducted to increase soluble solids, including sugars, in the overflows and to maintain the quality of the underflows; chemical analysis of both the overflows and the underflows revealed that Sufri date contains proteins/ amino acids and pectin in small quantities, which can be utilised as byproducts. Physical treatment involved maceration with different ratios (date/water) at mild temperatures (30 - 60 °C) for different times (10 - 30 min). Over this range the increase in soluble solids in the overflow was at a minimum but the underflow retained its quality and softening of date tissues was achieved. Different extraction ratios indicated that a lower ratio produced a low overflow which was turbid, but that the higher ratios produced overflows which were dilute. Serial extractions with the same ratio in the initial extraction was not practical. In enzymic treatment, pectolytic enzymes were incubated with date underflows at different concentrations, temperatures for various incubation times. Overflows increased significantly over a short time and at low temperatures (30 min and 30 °C) indicating the effectiveness of pectolytic enzymes in releasing more of the overflows, and sugars were increased in the <b>overflows</b> as an <b>indication</b> of the effect of these enzymes on date cell walls. Pure pectolytic enzymes were investigated and it was found that specificity was very important for selection of suitable pectolytic enzymes. It is concluded that the Sufri variety of date is a good source of reducing sugars, and its by-products have a promising future...|$|R
