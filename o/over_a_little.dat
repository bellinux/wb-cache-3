500|$|An American admirer {{described}} her as [...] "ruling <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> kingdom of three thousand loving subjects {{with an iron}} scepter twined with roses." [...] Although Hill drove her associates hard, she drove herself harder. In 1877, she collapsed and {{had to take a}} break of several months from her work. Darley ascribes a number of contributory causes: [...] "chronic overwork, a lack of delegation, the death of her close friend Jane Senior, the failure of a brief engagement", as well as an attack on her by John Ruskin. The Hill family found a companion for her, Harriot Yorke (1843–1930). Yorke took on a great amount of the everyday work that had caused Hill's collapse. She remained her companion until Hill's death. [...] A further palliative was the building of a cottage, at Crockham Hill near Sevenoaks in Kent, where they could take breaks from their work in London.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics; many were {{more critical of}} the episode than [...] "Christmas Carol". Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B and wrote {{that he did not}} [...] "totally buy “Emily” [...] even though I like large portions of" [...] the episode. VanDerWerff wrote positively of [...] "most of the Scully scenes", noting that Anderson [...] "found some of the raw sense of hope and loss" [...] that the shots required. However, he was critical of the episode's plot, arguing that it only [...] "goes through the motions" [...] and [...] "is about everybody getting really worked up <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl we’ve just met." [...] He concluded that [...] "two-parter is strongest when it grabs hold of this notion. But it’s at its weakest when it turns into just another episode of The X-Files." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a 7 out of 10, and wrote [...] "Overall, this episode was not as strong as the previous installment, largely due to the shift from in-depth character exploration to a rehashing of earlier elements of the mythology. Emily is a good plot device in terms of personalizing the conspiracy’s depredations just a bit more, but at times, it seems like the writers are victimizing Scully a bit more than necessary. Unlike the later mythology episodes, however, this one manages to avoid any unnecessary new elements." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first mechanically-propelled, two-wheeled vehicle {{may have}} been built by Kirkpatrick MacMillan, a Scottish blacksmith, in 1839, {{although}} the claim is often disputed. He is also associated with the first recorded instance of a cycling traffic offense, when a Glasgow newspaper in 1842 reported an accident in which an anonymous [...] "gentleman from Dumfries-shire... bestride a velocipede... of ingenious design" [...] knocked <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl in Glasgow and was fined five shillings.|$|E
2500|$|Grace took a vehemently pro-prosecution {{position}} {{throughout the}} 2006 Duke University lacrosse case, in which Crystal Gail Mangum, a stripper and North Carolina Central University student, falsely accused {{three members of}} Duke University's men's lacrosse team of raping her at a party. Prior to Duke suspending its men's lacrosse team's season, she sarcastically noted on the air, [...] "I'm so glad they didn't miss a lacrosse game <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> thing like gang rape!" [...] and [...] "Why would {{you go to a}} cop in an alleged gang rape case, say, and lie and give misleading information?" [...] After the disbarment of District Attorney Mike Nifong, Attorney General Roy Cooper pronounced all three players innocent of the rape charges made by Mangum and Nifong. On the following broadcast of her show, Grace did not appear and a substitute reporter, Jane Velez-Mitchell, announced the removal of all charges.|$|E
2500|$|Among those giving {{extensive}} coverage {{to the matter}} was Nancy Grace. [...] Before Duke suspended its men's lacrosse team's season, she sarcastically noted on the air, [...] "I'm so glad they didn't miss a lacrosse game <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> thing like gang rape!" [...] and [...] "Why would {{you go to a}} cop in an alleged gang rape case, say, and lie and give misleading information?" [...] Another, Susan Estrich, said [...] "I teach criminal law. But what are we dealing with here? The mafia, or a sports team from a first-class university. Instead, they hire them lawyers to trash the victim and the prosecutor." [...] Former prosecutor Wendy Murphy supplied the case {{with some of the most}} inflammatory claims and supported Nifong's withholding of evidence saying, [...] "Nifong should be rewarded for respecting the defendants' rights by not leaking the type of evidence that could help him personally respond to criticism." [...] Murphy said [...] "I never, ever met a false rape claim, by the way. My own statistics speak to the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] Captain Dave said. [...] "I {{always say}} to John Wilkes, 'Give good measurement, John--better <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>over</b> than <b>a</b> <b>little</b> under.' Nothing can be clearer or more satisfactory." ...|$|R

2500|$|This {{trail is}} 0.54 mile long, it is a medium {{challenge}} trail, {{and leads to}} El Charco ("The Pond"), a natural swimming hole. It is located north of the parking area, and starts {{at the end of}} Trail #7. After hiking north from the parking area on Trail #7 (Trail #7 is a 0.1 mile long paved road), and hiking by the camping area, Trail #7 comes to an end at the Doña Juana Creek. There is a sign pointing West (Charco Confesora) near the picnic area next to the camping area that serves as a landmark. At this point hikers walk <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bridge to cross the creek, where Trail #8 begins. The trail heads northwest along the creek (the creek is located {{to the left of the}} trail) and the trail is abundant with wild flowers. It is a downhill trail and a bit muddy. A section of the trail consists of concrete steps. At the end of the trail is Charco La Confesora, a natural [...] "pool", with a waterfall as a backdrop. swimming is allowed at this charco. The return path is the same as the path to the charco as the trail terminates at the charco.|$|E
