The owner, who is treated as the polong's parent, must feed the spirit daily with blood from their neck. A {{person who has been}} afflicted by the polong will cry out and wildly strike at people nearby, all the while blind and deaf to their surroundings, and unconscious <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> doing. In such cases, a bomoh would be called into question the polong and find out who is its parent and where they are located. If the polong lies or conceals the identity of its owner, the victim will die after one or two days.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{described}} the performance as [...] "very cordial", {{with the audience}} close to performers, and that [...] "one show is never {{the same as the}} next because of the songs, <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are.</b> Blues is about how you feel today. One day, you're down; another day is real happy and giddy. We're all laughing. Randy's direction captures that. It's always so personal, bringing the audience into the piece." [...] As well as African music, the revue includes [...] "country, gospel, the old blues, Appalachian music," [...] featuring music by Patsy Cline, Brenda Lee, Mahalia Jackson, Jimmy Rogers, Nina Simone and Muddy Waters.|$|E

Forensic chemists follow {{a set of}} standards that have been proposed by various agencies and governing bodies, including the Scientific Working Group on the Analysis of Seized Drugs. [...] In addition to the standard operating procedures proposed by the group, specific agencies have their own standards regarding the quality assurance and quality control of their results and their instruments. [...] To ensure the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> reporting, forensic chemists routinely check and verify that their instruments are working correctly and are still able to detect and measure various quantities of different substances.|$|E

500|$|This unusual {{ability for}} a primate to exhibit dormancy, in {{addition}} to the diminutive size, has led researchers to speculate that ancestral lemurs, and possibly ancestral primates, may have shared some traits with mouse lemurs. [...] Consequently, the gray mouse lemur has once again been used as a model organism for studying lemur and primate evolution. [...] For example, lemurs are thought to have colonized Madagascar by rafting to the island around 60 million years ago according to molecular phylogenetic studies. [...] Before the discovery that ocean currents were the opposite <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> today, thus favoring such an event, it was thought that it would have taken too long for any animal not capable of entering a state of dormancy to survive the trip. [...] Therefore, the mouse lemurs, such as the gray mouse lemur, were thought to have shared this plesiomorphic (ancestral) trait with the ancestral lemurs.|$|E
500|$|The filmmaking {{style of}} David Lynch {{has been written}} about {{extensively}} using descriptions like [...] "ultraweird", [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "oddball". Todd McGowan writes, [...] "One cannot watch a Lynch film the way one watches a standard Hollywood film noir nor in the way that one watches most radical films." [...] Through Lynch's juxtaposition of cliché and surreal, nightmares and fantasies, nonlinear story lines, camera work, sound and lighting, he presents a film that challenges viewers to suspend belief <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> experiencing. Many of the characters in Mulholland Drive are archetypes that can only be perceived as cliché: the new Hollywood hopeful, the femme fatale, the maverick director and shady powerbrokers that Lynch never seems to explore fully. Lynch places these often hackneyed characters in dire situations, creating dream-like qualities. By using these characters in scenarios that have components and references to dreams, fantasies and nightmares, viewers are left to decide, between the extremes, what is reality. One film analyst writes of him, [...] "Like most surrealists, Lynch's language of the unexplained is the fluid language of dreams." ...|$|E
500|$|... "What Have You Done for Me Lately" [...] is {{regarded}} as one of the singer's singles which helped establish her as a known artist. Upon its debut, it was compared favorably to similar recordings of female empowerment released by black women, such as [...] "New Attitude" [...] by Patti LaBelle, [...] "Better Be Good to Me" [...] by Tina Turner and [...] "Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves" [...] by Aretha Franklin. Oprah Winfrey commented: [...] "What you're seeing in all the areas of arts and entertainment is black women internalizing the idea of black power and pride... Black women started listening to their inner cues, rather than society or even the black community's idea <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> supposed to be and can be." [...] It ranked number three hundred and forty-one on Blenders list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born". In 2012, Mike Staver wrote in Leadership Isn't For Cowards: How to Drive Performance by Challenging People that [...] "'What Have You Done for Me Lately?' is not just some old Janet Jackson song, but a regular tune sung by leaders every day".|$|E

5000|$|It is {{important}} for the actor to understand [...] "not too quickly". He must reflect and interrogate himself about the possibilities; he should surprise himself. Brecht suggested this should be done in terms of an actor evaluating their choices first in terms <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not doing, and then in terms <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing. Every choice has an opposite that the actor needs be aware of. In the scientific age, an actor should be able to play an emotion sociologically, by the interaction of the ensemble of characters.|$|R

500|$|By 10th May, Tangier Island off the Virginia coast {{had been}} {{occupied}} by the British and offered an accessible location for those seeking refuge. Male refugees were given the option [...] "to become blue Jackets, take up arms or [...] join the working party" [...] constructing Fort Albion and its infrastructure. The Corps was embodied on 18 May 1814 and made its combat debut in the raid on Pungoteague Creek on 30 May 1814 where, in a skirmish known as the Battle of Rumley's Gut, it helped capture an American artillery battery. James Ross, captain of , later described their involvement as [...] "a most excellent specimen <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> likely to be. Their conduct was marked by great spirit and vivacity, and perfect obedience". One, a soldier named Michael Harding, was killed early in the battle but [...] "it did not daunt or check the others, but on the contrary animated them to seek revenge". Cockburn's initial impressions were positive; he observed that the new recruits were [...] "getting on astonishingly" [...] and were [...] "really fine fellows". After this, the Corps participated in the Chesapeake campaign; in subsequent correspondence, Cockburn wrote that the recruits had behaved [...] "unexpectedly well" [...] in several engagements and had not committed any [...] "improper outrages".|$|E
500|$|Phillip Atwell {{directed}} the music video on December 10–11, 2002. Almost all the film footage {{was used in}} the video except for a scene where 50 Cent raps in a glass box. The video is set in a fictional hip hop boot camp known as the Shady/Aftermath Artist Development Center. It begins with a black Hummer driving to the facility at an unknown location. Video clips from Eminem's single [...] "Without Me" [...] are seen playing in the entrance on flat screen TVs. We see Eminem & Dr. Dre looking down at the lab from a lab balcony with windows. 50 Cent is introduced by hanging upside down from the roof of a gym. Atwell commented, [...] "I think I could have done better with it, but I really liked the way that it turned out". The video also contains a shooting range, which Atwell felt was appropriate because 50 Cent had been shot nine times. He said, [...] "creatively, I felt like we were able to put guns in a video and have it play. And I like it when you are able to play within the standards and still give the artist something symbolic <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> going for." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", {{peaked at}} number four on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and at {{number one on}} the Hot Black Singles chart.

It was certified gold in November, 1990. Critic Jon Bream noted [...] "the songwriters have slyly juxtaposed a nasty-sounding groove and the repetition of the word 'nasty' with a subtle antinasty message." ...|$|E

2500|$|Continuing {{to evade}} the viewer's search for figurative {{elements}} in his paintings, Pollock abandoned titles and started numbering his works. He said about this: [...] "...look passively and try to receive what the painting has to offer and not bring a subject matter or preconceived idea <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> to be looking for." [...] Pollock's wife, Lee Krasner, said Pollock [...] "used to give his pictures conventional titles... but now he simply numbers them. Numbers are neutral.

2500|$|The {{next stage}} in reading {{development}} is the fluent, comprehending reader stage, in which children shift from learning to read, to reading to learn. [...] In this stage the reader builds up a substantial background of knowledge of spelling. It is during this time in a reader's development that teachers and parents can be tricked by fluent-sounding reading into thinking that a child understands everything {{that he or she}} is reading. As the content <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> able to read [...] becomes more demanding, good readers will develop knowledge of figurative language and irony which helps them to discover new meanings in the text. This will assist them to understand the meaning <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> reading beyond what is written on the page. [...] While learning to read, one of the most powerful moments is when fluent comprehending readers learn to enter into the lives of imagined heroes and heroines. Examples of books where these imagined heroes and heroines could be found in include Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Huckleberry Finn. [...] The comprehension process grows while reading books like these, where children learn how to connect prior knowledge, predict good or bad consequences, draw inferences from every danger-filled corner, monitor gaps in their understanding, and interpret how each new clue, revelation, or added piece of knowledge changes what they know. In learning these new skills, they learn to unpeel the layers of meaning in a word, a phrase or a thought.|$|E
2500|$|Russ Meyer {{was also}} adept at mocking moral {{stereotypes}} and flagrantly lampooning conservative American values. Many {{of his films}} feature a narrator who attempts to give the audience a [...] "moral roadmap" [...] <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> watching. Like his contemporary Terry Southern, Meyer realized that sex— {{as one of the}} few common interests among most humans— was a natural vehicle for satirizing values and conventions held by the Greatest Generation. According to Roger Ebert in a commentary recorded for the DVD release of Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, Meyer continually reiterated that this irreverence was the true secret to his artistic success.|$|E
