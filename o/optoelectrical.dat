40|$|Highly {{conductive}} gallium-doped {{zinc oxide}} (GZO) transparent thin films were deposited on glass substrates by RF mag­netron sputtering. The deposited films {{were characterized by}} X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), four-point probe and UV-Vis spectrophotometer, respectively. The effect of growth temperature on the structure and <b>optoelectrical</b> properties of the films was investigated. The results demonstrate that high quality GZO films oriented with their crystal­lographic c-axis perpendicular to the substrates are obtained. The structure and <b>optoelectrical</b> properties of the films are highly dependent on the growth temperature. It is found that with increasing growth temperature, the average visible transmittance of the deposited films is enhanced and the residual stress in the thin films is obviously relaxed. The GZO films deposited {{at the growth temperature}} of 400 °C, which have the largest grain size (74. 3 nm), the lowest electrical resistivity (1. 31 × 10 - 3 Ω·cm) and the maximum figure of merit (1. 46 × 1 O- 2 Ω- 1), exhibit the best <b>optoelectrical</b> properties.

40|$|A {{cupric oxide}} {{nanowire}} (CuO NW) device was prepared by assembling a single CuO NW onto {{a pair of}} gold microelectrodes using ac dielectrophoresis. Subsequent surface functionalization with a fluorinated benzenethiol self-assembled monolayer (FBT-SAM) was found capable of changing the electrical and <b>optoelectrical</b> properties of the CuO NW, which exhibited a reduced dark current, but an enhanced photoresponse. These effects are {{explained in terms of}} molecularly engineered NW-electrode contact and surface dipole effect over the NW body. Our study demonstrates that the electrical and <b>optoelectrical</b> properties of the CuO single NW device can be adjusted and fine-tuned by simply attaching specific FBT-SAMs. In combining with appropriate further chemical engineering over the FBT-SAM, a more efficient photoresponsive CuO single NW device can be expected. Unlike ZnO and TiO 2, which absorb in UV, CuO NWs absorb in the red and near-infrared region and thus can be potentially more useful for general photovoltaic and optoelectronic purposes. © 2010 American Chemical Society...|$|E
