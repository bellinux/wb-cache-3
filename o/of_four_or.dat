5|$|Art {{projects}} {{continue in}} various ways. Each year in April a well dressing competition is organised around a theme {{set by the}} Malvern Spa Association, with Gold, Silver and Bronze awards presented to adult's and children's groups. The well dressing initiative usually takes place over a period <b>of</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> five days with the Malvern spouts starting the annual season of well dressing {{around the country in}} the Derbyshire tradition. In 2003, photographer Bob Bilsland gave permission to the BBC to publish 21 of his special panaoramic views of the decorated wells and spouts.|$|E
5|$|Bouldering {{competitions}} {{occur in}} both {{indoor and outdoor}} settings. The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) employs an indoor format that breaks the competition into three rounds: qualifications, semi-finals, and finals. The rounds feature different sets <b>of</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> five boulder problems, and each competitor has a fixed {{amount of time to}} attempt each problem. At the end of each round, competitors are ranked by the number of completed problems, with ties settled {{by the total number of}} attempts taken to solve the problems.|$|E
5|$|Flock {{behaviour}} in sheep {{is generally}} only exhibited in groups <b>of</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> more sheep; fewer sheep may not react as expected when {{alone or with}} few other sheep. Being a prey species, the primary defense mechanism of sheep is to flee from danger when their flight zone is entered. Cornered sheep may charge and butt, or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture. This is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.|$|E

5|$|Initially, it was rumoured that, {{following}} the armistice, all French {{troops would be}} soon returned by the Germans. From the autumn of 1940, the Germans began to repatriate French reservists whose private occupations were in short supply in Vichy France, such as medical workers like doctors and nurses along with postmen and gendarmes. In 1941, after lobbying by the Vichy government, the policy was extended to French veterans of World War I and fathers <b>of</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> more children. Individual prisoners with good contacts could also be requested for repatriation. In practice, this meant that {{a disproportionate number of}} prisoners who were released early came from the upper classes.|$|E
5|$|Laying {{takes place}} in September and October. A clutch <b>of</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> five white and {{slightly}} shiny eggs, measuring 30 x 24mm, is laid. The incubation period has been recorded as anywhere from 19 to 23 days, with the female performing this duty alone. Newly hatched chicks are covered with long white down, and are largely helpless (nidicolous). They leave the nest four to five weeks after hatching and join up with other young birds in flocks, though rely on their parents for food for another fortnight after fledging.|$|E

5|$|An Early Classic tomb was {{inserted}} under the main pyramid at Zaculeu; {{it had been}} tunnelled from the volcanic ash underlying the structure. A broad stairway descended to the tomb from the main plaza. The tomb interior was painted red and the floor was scattered with the remains of more than 100 ceramic vessels. These were crushed when {{the roof of the}} tomb collapsed. Also found were the remains of 34 pyrite mirrors of a type similar to those found at Kaminaljuyu. A sizeable quantity of jade was recovered from the tomb, including beads and earplugs. Some of the jade beads had been carved to represent human and parrot faces. The tomb contained the bones <b>of</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> more individuals. The ceramic offerings included decorated tripod vessels, polychrome bowls and a polychrome cylindrical vase that had a painted band of hieroglyphs. One ceramic bowl is painted in a negative painting style that is similar to finds from Nebaj.|$|E
5|$|At the Battle of Millstone, Brigadier General Philemon Dickinson of the New Jersey militia {{scored a}} {{brilliant}} success. On 20 January 1777 near Van Nest's Mill, 400 militia and 50 Pennsylvania riflemen crossed an icy stream and fought a pitched battle with 500 British regulars and three cannons. The British lost 25 casualties, 12 prisoners, 43 wagons, 104 horses, 115 cattle and about 60 sheep. The Americans admitted losses <b>of</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> five men. Afterward, the British {{refused to believe}} that they had been beaten by militia. On 23 January two British regiments were waylaid by Brigadier General William Maxwell near Woodbridge. The 200 New Jersey Continentals inflicted losses of seven killed and 12 wounded while only suffering two men wounded.|$|E

On December 5, Pole received twenty-six votes, only two short of the requisite two-thirds majority, prompting French ambassador Claude d'Urfé to rush {{to the door of the}} conclave, demanding that the conclave wait for the French cardinals, whom he claimed were in Corsica, and threatening that the election of a pope in their absence would be likely to cause a schism.|$|E

Completing songs in this mode unlocks the songs for play within the other game modes. Players can choose their on-stage character and their guitar; these elements {{have no effect}} on gameplay but affect the visuals during the performance. In Career Mode, players can earn money from their performances that is redeemable at the in-game store, where bonus content, such as additional songs, guitars and finishes, can be unlocked. Quick Play mode allows the player to play any unlocked track, selecting the difficulty, the character, venue and guitar. After successfully completing a song in either Career or Quick Play mode, the player is given a score and a rating between three-five stars, depending on his or her overall performance.|$|E
5|$|Mantises {{have two}} spiked, {{grasping}} forelegs ("raptorial legs") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, including the posterior four {{legs of a}} mantis, the coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment {{about as long as}} the femur, which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration). Located {{at the base of the}} femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the mantis its grasp on its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage, made <b>of</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no arolium.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the sublingua in lemurs {{was thought}} to be a vestigial organ {{inherited}} from their mammalian ancestors. In lemuriform primates, the sublingua is used to remove hair and debris from the highly specialized toothcomb, an arrangement <b>of</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> six long, forward-facing teeth in the lower jaw used in oral grooming. The toothcomb of lemuriforms consists of both incisors and canine teeth (which reinforce the incisors), and together, these finely spaced teeth act like teeth on a comb. Although the cleaning function has been suspected for nearly a century, there has been no clear confirmation of this. However, a study from 1941 presented evidence that the toothcomb accumulated a mat of hair during oral grooming, and the author did observe that lemurs extend and retract their tongue rapidly, possibly to use the sublingua to clean the toothcomb.|$|E

5|$|Points {{are awarded}} from 1 to 7, with 7 being equal to A*, 6 equal to A, and so on. Up to three {{additional}} points are awarded {{depending on the}} grades achieved in the extended essay and theory of knowledge, so the maximum possible point total in the IBDP is 45. The global pass rate for the IB diploma is approximately 80%. In order to receive an IB diploma, candidates must receive a minimum of 24 points or an average <b>of</b> <b>four</b> (<b>or</b> C) {{out of a possible}} seven points for six subjects. Candidates must also receive a minimum of 12 points from their Higher Level subjects and a minimum of 9 points from their Standard Level subjects. Additionally, candidates must complete all of the requirements for the EE, CAS and TOK. Failing conditions that will prevent a student from being awarded a diploma, regardless of points received, are non-completion of CAS, more than three scores of 3 or below, not meeting the specific points required for Higher Level or Standard Level subjects, or plagiarism in addition to scoring higher than a score of 1 in any subject/level.|$|E
5|$|The Restaurant was {{the first}} time White had a kitchen staff {{organised}} into traditional brigades such as he had worked in while at Albert Roux's Le Gavroche. At Harveys, White had eight chefs under him on average, which was expanded to a team of about 20 at The Restaurant. Five of the chefs moved from Harveys to The Restaurant with him, while another former Harveys chef joined them among several others who joined from other Michelin starred restaurants from the UK and France. This enabled White to adopt a structure with himself, a head chef, a team <b>of</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> five sous chefs and teams on fish, meat/sauce, larder and pastry. Each of those sections was then broken down into a chef de partie heading the team, and then commis chefs under them. By 1994, Éric Chavot had joined the brigade as head chef under White. He left the following year with White's assistance to open the restaurant Interlude de Chavot.|$|E
5|$|The larvae grow {{through a}} series <b>of</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> five moults and enter the pupal stage. The pupa has the {{appendages}} free and not fused to the body as in a butterfly pupa. The differentiation into queens and workers (which are both female), and different castes of workers, is influenced in some species by the nutrition the larvae obtain. Genetic influences and the control of gene expression by the developmental environment are complex and the determination of caste {{continues to be a}} subject of research. Winged male ants, called drones, emerge from pupae along with the usually winged breeding females. Some species, such as army ants, have wingless queens. Larvae and pupae need to be kept at fairly constant temperatures to ensure proper development, and so often, are moved around among the various brood chambers within the colony.|$|E

5|$|The {{preferred}} breeding {{habitat in}} Eurasia is open woodland with dense low cover for nesting; despite its name, gardens are rarely occupied by this small passerine bird. The clutch <b>of</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> five blotched cream or white eggs is laid in a robust cup-shaped nest built near {{the ground and}} concealed by dense vegetation. The eggs are incubated for 11–12days. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 10days after hatching. Only {{about a quarter of}} young birds survive their first year. The garden warbler is strongly migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. A wide range of habitats are used in Africa, but closed forest and treeless Sahel are both shunned. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, although fruit predominates when birds are fattening prior to migration, figs being a particular favourite where available. These warblers have a mixed diet of insects and fruit in their African wintering grounds.|$|E
5|$|The three recent {{treatments}} (Henderson and coauthors, Glassman, and Govaerts and Dransfield) recognised a {{total of}} 73 species, but only 20 species are accepted by all of them. The remainder account for either nine species or more than 40. For example, what Andrew Henderson considered a single species, Attalea attaleoides, other authors have considered a species complex consisting <b>of</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> five species. Glassman doubted the validity of A.attaleoides as a species, and described four new species from material {{that had previously been}} attributed to A.attaleoides—A.camopiensis, A.degranvillei, A.guianensis and A.maripensis. Govaerts and Dransfield accepted both Glassman's four species and A.attaleoides. However, Jean-Christophe Pintaud was of the opinion that A.guianensis, A.maripensis and A.attaleoides were all very similar, and thought it likely that they all represented the same species.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} in {{breeding}} plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and pale pink-buff underparts fading to whitish {{on the lower}} belly. The head is grey with a broad white supercilium ("eyebrow"), and the outer tail feathers are white. In winter, the head is grey-brown, the supercilium is duller, the upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, streaked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks. There are only minor differences between the three subspecies, the sexes are almost identical, and young birds resemble adults. The water pipit's song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists <b>of</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> five blocks, each consisting of about six repetitions of a different short note.|$|E
