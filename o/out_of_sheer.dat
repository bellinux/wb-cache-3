25|$|Power Negation: Cancelling out someone else's magic or voodoo curse. Zoe {{was able}} to use this power when Marie Laveau sent evil undead creatures (zombies) to Miss Robichaux's Academy, {{although}} she had no prior knowledge that she possessed the ability before-hand and it was activated <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheer</b> panic and alarm.|$|E
25|$|Malacañang had defended Duterte's remarks, {{claiming}} {{that it should}} not be taken seriously because it is due to heightened bravado. Several public officials expressed their distaste for the remark, including a Bangsamoro committee member who quit the council <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheer</b> disgust. Women's rights groups protested Duterte's statements {{claiming that}} rape is a heinous crime and should not be joked about, even alleging that the Maranao refugees in the evacuation camps were being threatened with rape by soldiers who were encouraged by the President.|$|E

50|$|Phoebe Cuckoo {{demonstrated}} a power-hungry personality during {{the events of}} Warsong. In contrast to Celeste, who feared the consuming power of the Phoenix, Phoebe desired power <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sheer</b> affinity for wielding it. She readily embraced the Phoenix and enjoyed the destructive power it gave her.|$|R
50|$|The upper monastery {{houses the}} Church of the Presentation and the Church of the Holy Cross. Saint Basil of Ostrog's relics {{lie in the}} Church of the Presentation.

25|$|Dean, who {{had been}} {{suffering}} with a severe bout of the flu for several days, attended a post-caucus rally for his volunteers at the Val-Air Ballroom in West Des Moines, Iowa and delivered his concession speech, aimed at cheering up those in attendance. Dean was shouting over the cheers of his enthusiastic audience, but the crowd noise was being filtered out by his unidirectional microphone, leaving only his full-throated exhortations audible to the television viewers. To those at home, he seemed to raise his voice <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheer</b> emotion.|$|E
25|$|After this incident, Upham was {{considered}} extremely dangerous and {{was placed in}} solitary confinement. He was only allowed to exercise alone, while accompanied by two armed guards and while covered by a machine gun in a tower. Despite these precautions, Upham bolted from his little courtyard, straight through the German barracks and out through the front gate of the camp. The guard in the machine-gun tower later told other prisoners that he refrained from shooting Upham <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheer</b> respect, and as he could see German soldiers coming up the road whom he expected to capture Upham. Upham was soon recaptured {{and sent to the}} infamous Oflag IV-C (Colditz) on 14 October 1944.|$|E
25|$|According to Shia view, Muawiyah opposed Ali, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheer</b> greed {{for power}} and wealth. His reign {{opened the door to}} the {{persecution}} of Ali's supporters, slaughtering of his followers, and unlawful imprisonment of his supporters, which only worsened when Yazid came into power and the Battle of Karbala ensued. Muawiyah is alleged to have killed many of Muhammad's companions (Sahabah), either in battle or by poison, due to his lust for power. Muawiyah killed several historical figures, including the Sahabah, Amr bin al-Hamiq, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, Malik al-Ashtar, Hujr ibn Adi (to which the families of Abu Bakr and Umar condemned Muawiyah for, and the Sahaba deemed his killer to be cursed) and Abd al-Rahman bin Hasaan (buried alive for his support of Ali).|$|E
50|$|Henry Stone and {{everyone}} at TK Records really liked the augmented version, so Brown and Stone made the album deal and {{settled on a}} six-month deadline to write new material and record the album. Brown also photographed the album's somewhat controversial cover and revealed, in a 1978 interview in Rolling Stone, that he had created the cover's nude model <b>out</b> <b>of</b> cardboard, <b>sheer</b> fabric and ribbons.|$|R

500|$|... "Come Together" [...] {{was later}} {{released}} as a double A-side single with [...] "Something". In the liner notes to the compilation album Love, Martin described the track as [...] "a simple song but it stands <b>out</b> because <b>of</b> the <b>sheer</b> brilliance <b>of</b> the performers".|$|R
25|$|The {{urbanization}} in {{the second}} half of the 19th century induced other significant changes that would ultimately change the kitchen. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheer</b> necessity, cities began planning and building water distribution pipes into homes, and built sewers to deal with the waste water. Gas pipes were laid; gas was used first for lighting purposes, but once the network had grown sufficiently, it also became available for heating and cooking on gas stoves. At the turn of the 20th century, electricity had been mastered well enough to become a commercially viable alternative to gas and slowly started replacing the latter. But like the gas stove, the electric stove had a slow start. The first electrical stove had been presented in 1893 at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, but it was not until the 1930s that the technology was stable enough and began to take off.|$|E
25|$|John's {{marriage}} {{was never a}} happy one. Rumors circulated that {{at the age of}} 25 {{he fell in love with}} Eugênia José de Menezes, his wife's chaperone. She became pregnant, and John was suspected of being the father. The case was hushed up, and the young woman was sent to Spain to bear the child. She gave birth to a daughter, whose name is unknown. The mother lived the rest of her life in nunneries and John supported her economically. Historians Tobias Monteiro and Patrick Wilcken write that there are indications that John also had a homosexual relationship as a sexual outlet, given his disastrous marriage, in which he lived apart from his wife, with whom he was together only on ceremonial occasions. His partner in this relationship would have been his favorite manservant, Francisco José Rufino de Sousa Lobato, who, according to these historians, may have regularly masturbated his master. While it may have been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheer</b> malice, a priest named Miguel stated that he once stumbled upon the scene and therefore was deported to Angola, but not before leaving written testimony. Regardless of the truth or falsity of the claim, Rufino de Sousa received a variety of honors, accumulating among others the charges of adviser to the king, secretary of the Casa do Infantado, secretary of the Bureau of Conscience and Orders (Mesa de Consciência e Ordens) and governor of the Santa Cruz fortress. He also received the title of Baron and later Viscount of Vila Nova da Rainha.|$|E
500|$|As {{one of the}} few German generals {{of middle}} class upbringing, Model's {{background}} appealed to Hitler, who distrusted the old Prussian aristocratic order that still dominated the Wehrmacht's officer corps. His defensive tactics were a much better fit to Hitler's instincts never to give ground, than talk of [...] "elastic defence"—even if Model stood fast <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheer</b> necessity, and not due to fanaticism. His stubbornness, energy and ruthlessness were more qualities that Hitler found admirable, and Model's blunt and direct manner of speaking also made an impression.|$|E
5000|$|From an {{interview}} with Vijaya Mulay - For five years I sat as the presiding officer with other four members from an approved panel that judged Indian and foreign films. It gave me an insight into the biases of panellists that coloured their judgement of a film's suitability for public viewing. My work with the Film Censor Board proved a mixed blessing. I had to see films that ordinarily I would have walked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> in <b>sheer</b> boredom.|$|R
5000|$|Angeline Falls {{is located}} where the {{subterranean}} outlet of Angeline Lake rises <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sheer</b> cliff. According to the Northwest Waterfall Survey, it is [...] "among {{the best in}} Washington State" [...] and ranks number 9 in a list of best waterfalls in the Pacific Northwest. Access to the spectacular falls is considered difficult, only recommended for experienced hikers, and includes potentially waist-deep wading through a water outlet across a logjam, to the east shore of Delta Lake for the best view.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, Larry convinces Anna {{to see him}} {{one last}} time; she agrees to sleep with him so that he will sign the divorce papers and leave her alone. Dan {{suspects}} the affair, to which Anna confesses, and following their argument, she returns to Larry. Distraught, Dan confronts Larry {{to try to get}} Anna back. Instead, Larry tells him Alice's whereabouts, and suggests that he go back to her. Suddenly, however, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a <b>sheer</b> malicious impulse, he also tells him that he had a one-night stand with her.|$|R
500|$|Brownlee {{was also}} active on natural {{resource}} issues. Alberta, along with Saskatchewan and Manitoba, had been admitted into Confederation without being granted the control over its natural resources {{that the older}} provinces enjoyed over theirs. While the federal government did provide a compensatory grant in lieu of resource rights, Alberta sought control over the resources {{not only because it}} believed that this would yield higher revenues than the grant, but <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheer</b> pride. [...] In 1920, Prime Minister Arthur Meighen committed the federal government in principle to transferring resource rights; all that remained to discuss were the terms. [...] Alberta, while willing to forgo the annual subsidy, wanted compensation for some of the land and resources previously awarded by the federal government to private interests, including [...] of land granted to eastern railway companies, mineral leases that deprived the government of royalties {{for more than half of}} the [...] of coal extracted from Alberta annually, and assorted areas with hydroelectric potential that had been yielded to private companies.|$|E
500|$|On Thanksgiving Day 1976, Morrison {{performed}} at the farewell concert for the Band. It was his first live performance in several years, and he considered skipping his appearance until the last minute, even refusing to go on stage when they announced his name. His manager, Harvey Goldsmith, said he [...] "literally kicked him out there." [...] Morrison was on good terms {{with the members of}} the Band as near-neighbours in Woodstock, and they had the shared experience of stage fright. At the concert, he performed two songs. His first was a rendition of the classic Irish song [...] "Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral". His second song was [...] "Caravan", from his 1970 album Moondance. Greil Marcus, in attendance at the concert, wrote: [...] "Van Morrison turned the show around...singing to the rafters and ...burning holes in the floor. It was a triumph, and as the song ended Van began to kick his leg into the air <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheer</b> exuberance and he kicked his way right offstage like a Rockette. The crowd had given him a fine welcome and they cheered wildly when he left." [...] The filmed concert served as the basis for Martin Scorsese's 1978 film, The Last Waltz.|$|E
2500|$|Later in {{a letter}} to Wilko Machetanz, his Tarkio roommate, Carothers {{expanded}} on his feelings of depression: [...] "I find myself, even now, accepting incalculable benefits proffered <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheer</b> magnanimity and good will and failing to make even such trivial return as circumstances permit and human feeling and decency demand, out of obtuseness or fear or selfishness or mere indifference and complete lack of feeling." ...|$|E
25|$|The {{spring at}} Banias {{initially}} originated {{in a large}} cave carved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a <b>sheer</b> cliff face which was gradually lined {{with a series of}} shrines. The temenos (sacred precinct) included in its final phase a temple placed {{at the mouth of the}} cave, courtyards for rituals, and niches for statues. It was constructed on an elevated, 80m long natural terrace along the cliff which towered over the north of the city. A four-line inscription at the base of one of the niches relates to Pan and Echo, the mountain nymph, and was dated to 87 BCE.|$|R

Taking the last first, Dada is a recent expression of the ancient absurdist spirit of relativism which, as an antidote to rationalism, is as old as Alley Oop and Protagoras. As a protest movement against the excesses of a rational society, Dada mushroomed briefly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the First World War. It arose among French and German intellectuals <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their <b>sheer</b> moral exhaustion and nausea over that War...|$|R

2500|$|As {{a junior}} officer, Felt served five years aboard the {{battleship}} [...] and the destroyer Farenholt before applying for flight training <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheer</b> boredom. From then on, naval aviation was his life. While training at Naval Air Station Pensacola from 1928 to 1929, Felt met his future wife, Kathryn Cowley, whom he married on August 3, 1929 after warning {{her that the}} Navy would always come first. She later reported that even as a newlywed, Felt's life was [...] "just fly, fly, fly." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "As a consequence," [...] Morris concludes, [...] "only a {{few years}} after Taft-Hartley, the NLRB and its union and {{employer}} constituents were routinely viewing majority-union bargaining—which was certainly the ultimate goal intended by the Act—as the only bargaining contemplated by the Act. [...] Although unions had originally favored NLRB elections <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheer</b> convenience, their reliance on the election process had now become routine, with attendant misunderstanding of the true scope of bargaining offered by the statute. ... Thus was born the latter-day conventional wisdom that assumes that majority-union representation is {{the sine qua non of}} collective bargaining." ...|$|E
5000|$|We {{then are}} {{introduced}} to Gaylord Spriggs gossip column, which noted that the whole operatic world was in a frenzy over the arrival of Nellie Melba and Christine De Chagny. The column reveals the vast amounts of money that were spent to induce Dame Melba to cross the Atlantic to come to New York. It also gushes about how Christine De Chagny's claim that she was coming to New York not for the money but <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her <b>sheer</b> admiration <b>of</b> the quality and {{desire to be a}} part of the newest opera [...] "The Angel of Shiloh", whose composer is yet unknown.|$|R
5000|$|Sampson {{received}} {{permission from}} his bishop, the Most Reverend Gerald T. Bergan, of Des Moines, Iowa {{to enter the}} United States Army as a chaplain. It was at Harvard University, strangely enough, that he really began his odyssey; for it was at Harvard that new Army chaplains received their initial entry training into the Army chaplaincy during World War II. After finishing the course, Sampson volunteered for an airborne assignment. It was also a decision, he wrote later, that was made <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ignorance. [...] "Like a zealous young business man, starting to in a strange town," [...] he admitted, [...] "I was ready to join anything <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a <b>sheer</b> sense <b>of</b> civic duty." ...|$|R

2500|$|Although Wild wrote {{most of the}} papers, he was {{characteristically}} {{generous in}} giving credit to others, saying [...] "I did put other people's names on them because they'd made important contributions". One, for example, was technical assistant Bill Rowe. During a period when the solar cycle was at a minimum and nothing was happening, Rowe drove down to Dapto for an 11 am appointment. Wild remarked: <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheer</b> conscientiousness he arrived at 8 am, switched on the gear and recorded the most magnificent outburst, {{which led to the}} discovery of first and second harmonics.

2500|$|During Richland's argument, {{the justices}} inquired closely about the city's {{contention}} that Quon had no reasonable expectation of privacy over his text messages. Justice Sotomayor asked Richland about a hypothetical {{scenario in which}} a sergeant knew that various officers engaged in sexually explicit texting with romantic partners and decided {{to look at the}} transcripts <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheer</b> salacity. [...] "Does that officer have any expectation of privacy that his boss won't just listen in out of prurient interest?"
