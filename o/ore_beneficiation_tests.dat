The ARC Research Hub for Advanced Technologies for Australian Iron Ore will focus its attention on developing innovative approaches for creating enhanced value across the full value chain through the characterisation of different <b>ore</b> types, <b>beneficiation</b> and materials handling and transport. This hub brings together five industrial organisations and a research team formed from well-established research groups based at the Newcastle Institute for Energy and Resources.

Methods for testing the comminution behavior must therefore be more efficient in terms of time and cost but also with respect to sample requirements. The integration of the test method into the geometallurgical modeling framework is also important.

30|$|Large {{volumes of}} mine {{tailings}} (solid minerals suspended in chemical-rich liquids) are generated worldwide as by-products of <b>ore</b> <b>beneficiation.</b> Conventionally, these loose slurries are deposited on ground with perimeter dykes constructed from their relatively coarser fraction. Such facilities {{are notorious for}} a high failure rate and the resulting economic, social, health, and environmental issues (Azam and Li, 2010). To reduce tailings footprint, next-generation containment strategies include waste disposal in mined-out pits or in thickening vessels. The storage capacity of these facilities depends on the dewatering behaviour of the deposited material under self weight. The settling process (rate and amount) is influenced by complex physicochemical phenomena at solid-liquid interfaces. Whereas field monitoring and laboratory testing are routinely carried out to understand the consolidation behaviour of the placed tailings, these methods are quite expensive, time consuming, and material specific. Sustainable waste management during operation, closure, and reclamation requires a general understanding of tailings consolidation.|$|R

Appropriate beneficiation process has to be advanced to reduce the waste generation in mines and for the sustainable growth of the iron ore industry some. Major reason for difficulty in beneficiation of BHJ is revealed from characterization studies which show the intergrowth of haematite and quartz.

In experiments, we observe formation of thick anisotropic "clouds" of nanoparticles around a micron-sized spherical filter element, and try to estimate the shape and the concentration profile of these clouds both in the absence and in the presence of the external flow.

The Pb-Zn cluster data model consists of five clusters and DMX queries. We analyzed the Pb-Zn cluster content, size, structure, and characteristics.

Often broadly classified as ‘clays’, {{the understanding of the}} distinct behaviour of phyllosilicates remains poor. This work focusses on talc, illite and kaolinite, and forms part of an ongoing study which aims at investigating the entire phyllosilicate group, categorised as serpentine, micas; talc/pyrophillite, kaolinites, illites, smectites and vermiculite. Using pure minerals belonging to each phyllosilicate type, a comprehensive surface charge and rheological analysis was conducted, incorporating their charge anisotropy and non-spherical morphology. The mineralogy was discussed, based on pre-existing knowledge of the minerals. Talc, kaolinite and illite suspensions are characterised by high yield stresses and low viscosities, with differences in their behaviour attributed to variations in charge anisotropy, aspect ratio and surface morphology. A comparison with other phyllosilicates showed that muscovite (mica) results in the least rheologically complex suspensions, while the fibrous nature of chrysotile (serpentine) leads to suspensions with the highest yield stresses and viscosities. The other minerals demonstrate intermediate rheological behaviour.
