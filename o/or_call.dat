5|$|The board {{claimed that}} the Goebel Election Law did not give them the power to hear proof of vote fraud <b>or</b> <b>call</b> witnesses, {{although}} the wording of their decision implied {{that they would have}} invalidated Taylor votes if they had been empowered to do so. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899. Days later, the Democratic-dominated General Assembly convened in Frankfort. They claimed the power to decide disputed elections, and formed a partisan commission (ten Democrats and one Republican) to examine the election results.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an artificial intelligence system by which hostile human enemies react to combat. If enemies discover the player, they may take cover <b>or</b> <b>call</b> for assistance, {{and can take}} advantage of players when they are distracted, out of ammunition, or in a fight. Player companions, such as Ellie, can assist in combat by throwing objects at threats to stun them, announcing the location of unseen enemies, or using a knife and pistol to attack enemies.|$|E
5|$|By December 1974, Lennon and Pang {{considered}} {{buying a}} house together, and he refused to accept Ono's phone calls. The next month, Lennon agreed to meet with Ono, {{who claimed to have}} found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home <b>or</b> <b>call</b> Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable, because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment with Pang; he was stupefied and confused {{to such an extent that}} Pang believed he had been brainwashed. He told her that his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.|$|E

5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate {{discusses}} the capability and liberty of citizens to criticize their government. Lewis {{asserts that the}} U.S. has the most unreserved speech of any nation. Law professor Jeremy Waldron gave the example {{of his ability to}} criticize the president <b>or</b> <b>call</b> the vice president and Secretary of Defense war criminals, without fear of retribution from law enforcement for such statements. The book contrasts present-day free speech liberties afforded to Americans and those possessed by citizens in earlier centuries. The author argues that the scope of civil liberties in the U.S. has increased over time owing to a desire for freedom among its people being held as an integral value. Lewis observes in contemporary application of the law, presidents are the subject of satire and denunciation. He notes that it is unlikely a vociferous critic would face a jail sentence simply for voicing such criticism.|$|E
5|$|The {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) in NOLF was significantly advanced {{at the time}} of the game's release. Enemy AI can react to eleven different stimuli, including hearing the player's footsteps or weapon firing, seeing the player's footprints in the snow, or hearing an ally scream in pain. The AI can try and investigate the source of these stimuli, by following the footprints for example, and can sound alarms <b>or</b> <b>call</b> for backup. During combat, the AI finds cover positions, and, to some extent, can also use its environment for protection, such as flipping over a table and hiding behind it. After advancing AI technology in their subsequent games, Monolith likened the way NOLFs AIs pop randomly in and out of cover to a shooting gallery. Groups of AI guards make use of a group logic when investigating and combating the player. For example, one guard might start firing at the player, while another runs and calls for backup. The game's AI includes friendly and enemy humans, as well as dogs, sharks, and helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Manhattan, they prepared a spare room for Julian {{when he visited}} them in their newly rented apartment. Lennon, hitherto inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he was refusing to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono {{who claimed to have}} found a cure for smoking. But after the meeting he failed to return home <b>or</b> <b>call</b> Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused {{to such an extent that}} Pang believed he had been brainwashed. He told her his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.|$|E

Thirty-two students (61.5 %) mentioned cold call during their interview. Thirty-one students (59.6 %) reported that cold <b>call</b> <b>or</b> random <b>call</b> increased their anxiety and one student (1.9 %) said it did not affect their anxiety.

25|$|Kaplan also {{developed}} a new style of reporting on bridge tournaments. Prior to Kaplan’s work, reports focused on the brilliancies of the players involved.

25|$|Examples {{of signals}} {{communicating}} supervision <b>or</b> <b>call</b> progress include E and M signaling, SF signaling, and robbed-bit signaling. In physical (not carrier) E and M trunk circuits, trunks were four wire. Fifty trunks {{would require a}} hundred pair cable between switches, for example. Conductors in one common circuit configuration were named tip, ring, ear (E) and mouth (M). Tip and ring were the voice-carrying pair, and named after the tip and ring on the three conductor cords on the manual operator's console.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{leverage}} is {{also reflected in}} the pricing of options written on leveraged ETFs. In particular, the terminal payoff of a leveraged ETF European/American put <b>or</b> <b>call</b> depends on the realized variance (hence the path) of the underlying index. The impact of leverage ratio can also be observed from the implied volatility surfaces of leveraged ETF options. For instance, the implied volatility curves of inverse leveraged ETFs (with negative multipliers such as -1, -2, or -3) are commonly observed to be increasing in strike, which is characteristically different from the implied volatility smiles or skews seen for index options or non-leveraged ETF options.|$|E

25|$|A diverse set {{of enemies}} is present, which usually require being {{approached}} with different tactics: some coordinate in groups to out-maneuver or out-position the player; others, {{such as the}} Manhack, fly directly at the player through small openings and tight corridors. Others use predictable but powerful attacks, while others hide before swiftly attacking the player. Gordon can kill most enemies with his weapons, or make use of indirect means, exploiting environmental hazards such as explosive pressurized canisters, gas fires or improvised traps. For some portions of the game, Gordon can be joined by up to four armed Resistance soldiers or medics, and can send his team further from him <b>or</b> <b>call</b> them back.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{parliament}} {{passed the}} government's {{bill that would}} set election dates on the third Monday in October of the fourth calendar year following polling day for the last general election, thereby reducing the maximum life of a parliament from the time set by the Constitution Act, 1867. The amendment to the Canada Elections Act, however, did not touch the governor general's prerogative to dissolve parliament <b>or</b> <b>call</b> elections, as such is a constitutional matter. Thus, the prime minister may advise such a move whenever he or she feels is prudent.
