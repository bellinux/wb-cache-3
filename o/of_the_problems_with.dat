Nuclear reactor {{accidents}} still occur and there is no convincing {{solution to the problem of}} long-lived radioactive waste. Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur, notably in Pakistan and North Korea, building on facilities and expertise from civilian nuclear operations. The alternatives to nuclear power, efficient energy use and renewable energy (especially wind power), have been further developed and commercialised.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of John's reign {{there was a sudden}} change in prices, as bad harvests and high demand for food {{resulted}} in much higher prices for grain and animals. This inflationary pressure was to continue {{for the rest of the}} 13th century and had long-term economic consequences for England. The resulting social pressures were complicated by bursts of deflation that resulted from John's military campaigns. It was usual at the time for the king to collect taxes in silver, which was then re-minted into new coins; these coins would then be put in barrels and sent to royal castles around the country, to be used to hire mercenaries or to meet other costs. At those times when John was preparing for campaigns in Normandy, for example, huge quantities of silver had to be withdrawn from the economy and stored for months, which unintentionally resulted in periods during which silver coins were simply hard to come by, commercial credit difficult to acquire and deflationary pressure placed on the economy. The result was political unrest across the country. John attempted to address some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the English currency in 1204 and 1205 by carrying out a radical overhaul of the coinage, improving its quality and consistency.|$|E
5|$|Maben was {{concerned}} that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the film {{was that it was}} too short. In early 1973, Maben was fly fishing with Waters, and suggested the possibility of improving the film by watching them at work in a recording studio. Subsequently, Maben was invited with a small crew using a single 35mm camera to Abbey Road Studios to film supposed recording sessions of The Dark Side of the Moon, as well as interviews conducted off-camera by Maben, and footage of the band eating and talking at the studio cafeteria. Maben was particularly happy about this footage, feeling it captured the spontaneous humour of the band. This version premiered on 21 August 1974, and ran for 80 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Nowhere was demobilization more of {{a problem}} than at Los Alamos, where there was an exodus of talent. Much {{remained}} to be done. The bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were like laboratory pieces; work would be required to make them simpler, safer and more reliable. Implosion methods needed to be developed for uranium in place of the wasteful gun method, and composite uranium-plutonium cores were needed now that plutonium was in short supply because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the reactors. However, uncertainty {{about the future of the}} laboratory made it hard to induce people to stay. Oppenheimer returned to his job at the University of California and Groves appointed Norris Bradbury as an interim replacement. In fact, Bradbury would remain in the post for the next 25 years. Groves attempted to combat the dissatisfaction caused by the lack of amenities with a construction program that included an improved water supply, three hundred houses, and recreation facilities.|$|E

25|$|The use {{of carbon}} dioxide overcomes many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the {{original}} industrial process. Because CO2 is a better flame inhibitor than N2, a CO2 environment allows {{for the use of}} pure oxygen directly, instead of air, with reduced flammability hazards. The solubility of molecular oxygen in solution is also enhanced in the CO2 environment. Because more oxygen is available to the system, supercritical carbon dioxide (Tc = 31°C) has more complete oxidation with fewer byproducts, lower carbon monoxide production, less decarboxylation and higher purity than the commercial process.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{during this}} period the {{magnetron}} team at Birmingham had made a breakthrough. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the magnetron was that every pulse caused slightly different oscillations within each cavity, sometimes interfering with each other. With some patterns, particularly the pi mode, the signals added up and the tube was much more efficient. James Sayers had discovered that if a strap of metal was run between alternating lobes of the magnetron's cavities, the pi mode was strongly favoured. This allowed power levels to be greatly increased, and GEC began producing the new CV64, designed to operate at as much as 50kW. These were known as strapped magnetrons.|$|E

25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the {{original}} {{formulation of the}} razor is that it only applies to models with the same explanatory power (i.e., it only tells us to prefer the simplest of equally good models). A more general form of the razor {{can be derived from}} Bayesian model comparison, which is based on Bayes factors and can be used to compare models that don't fit the observations equally well. These methods can sometimes optimally balance the complexity and power of a model. Generally, the exact Occam factor is intractable, but approximations such as Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, Variational Bayesian methods, false discovery rate, and Laplace's method are used. Many artificial intelligence researchers are now employing such techniques, for instance through work on Occam Learning or more generally on the Free energy principle.|$|E
25|$|During the Civil War, the {{infrastructure}} of St. Louis had suffered from neglect; another cholera epidemic struck in 1866, and typhoid fever raged in certain quarters.

40|$|Principal {{component}} analysis (PCA) is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{most widely used}} dimensionality reduction methods in scientific data analysis.

500|$|Things {{became more}} {{difficult}} for the Separatists in the Netherlands in the late 1610s as the Dutch government moved towards alliance with England. They had few opportunities in the Netherlands as they were limited to manual labor by the guilds' refusal to accept them, and they feared that their children were straying from their language and religion. Investors led by Thomas Weston agreed to finance an expedition to North America, and the ship Speedwell was sent to fetch Separatists from the Netherlands, then join the larger Mayflower to form a two-ship expedition. [...] After transporting the Separatists, the Speedwell proved unseaworthy for the ocean voyage.

500|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> {{defining}} this extended {{category is}} that weak resonances may exist {{and would be}} difficult to prove due to chaotic planetary perturbations and the current lack of knowledge of the orbits of these distant objects. They have orbital periods of more than 300 years and most have only been observed over a short observation arc of a couple years. Due to their great distance and slow movement against background stars, it may be decades before most of these distant orbits are determined well enough to confidently confirm or rule out a resonance. Further improvement in the orbit and potential resonance of these objects will help to understand the migration of the giant planets and the formation of the Solar System. For example, simulations by Emel’yanenko and Kiseleva in 2007 show that many distant objects could be in resonance with Neptune. They show a 10% likelihood that 2000 CR105 is in a 20:1 resonance, a 38% likelihood that 2003 QK91 is in a 10:3 resonance, and an 84% likelihood that [...] is in an 8:3 resonance.
