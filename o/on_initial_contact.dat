The last instructions given by Erjavec to JP550 were to call the upper-sector controller on 134.45MHz and to stop squawking the assigned squawk code. By instructing JP550 to squawk Standby, Erjavec simply released a code allocated for the middle sector. The data tag for the DC-9 would now disappear from his screen and the aircraft would become merely a point among many others.

40|$|THESIS 9190 This thesis {{examines}} Irish separatist {{foreign policy}} in 1919 - 23 through {{a case study of}} separatist activities in Germany. Separatists built <b>on</b> <b>initial</b> <b>contacts</b> and the work of local sympathisers in 1919 - 20 to establish a mission under John Chartres, which inaugurated a vigorous propaganda campaign in favour of Irish independence spearheaded by the bi-weekly Irische Bulletin. A consul, Charles Bewley, was also appointed to nurture commercial relations, while arms smugglers arranged two successful arms shipments m 1921 - 22. The thesis begins by outlining tentative links between separatists and the local German-Irish Society in 1919 - 20, examining the latter?s activities and its interpretation of Irish events. It then discusses the mission established in 1921, its institutional culture (personnel, finances, communications etc) and its contacts with influential figures in politics and the press. The thesis examines the mission?s propaganda campaign by examining the literature produced, particularly the bi-weekly Irische Bulletin, relating it to wider separatist ideology and propaganda and to German press coverage of Ireland...|$|R
50|$|As {{described}} previously, {{the pattern}} of dendritic branching depends <b>on</b> the <b>initial</b> <b>contact</b> of filopodia with afferent axons. The hypothesis predicts that regions with numerous prospective presynaptic terminals will attract more growing dendrites. Researchers have used the developing mouse spinal cord to test this hypothesis. A computer-assisted three-dimensional reconstruction system has been used with Golgi's method preparations of mouse spinal cords. The relative dendritic lengths and densities at various zones in the spinal cord indicate that dendritic growth is initially primarily towards the marginal zone (because of synaptogenic presynaptic terminals). However, this biased distribution is lost as synapses form in the intermediate zone. This study is consistent with predictions of the synaptotropic hypothesis of dendritic branching.|$|R

40|$|Background: To test seven {{different}} strategies for recruitment in a randomized controlled trial, to report documented response data from each strategy, {{and to discuss}} recruitment challenges. Methods: We used 5 opt-in (potential participants {{have to do something}} active to contact or be contacted by the researcher) and 2 opt-out (potential participants have the option to decline being contacted about a study) recruitment strategies from February 2013 until July 2014 to contact 1562 cancer patient candidates for participation in a randomized controlled trial.

40|$|Purpose and Background: Recent {{research}} {{has begun to}} focus on foot strike patterns {{as they relate to}} injuries in runners. Runners who employ a rear-foot strike (RFS) pattern (in which the heel lands before the ball of the foot) are more likely to experience repetitive stress injuries such as tibial stress fractures, patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), and plantar fasciitis. Conversely, runners demonstrating a forefoot strike (FFS) pattern (defined as the ball of the foot-usually the 4 th and 5 th metatarsal heads-landing before the heel) are more susceptible to Achilles tendon, plantarflexor, and metatarsal injuries. Several systematic studies have concluded that barefoot runners employed a FFS pattern while shod runners used a RFS pattern.

40|$|The first paper, “Dating as Learning,” {{extends the}} Becker (1973) and Burdett-Coles (1997) models of {{marriage}} markets by assuming that, <b>on</b> <b>initial</b> <b>contact,</b> {{people do not}} know the payoff to marriage.

Within this context, people learn characteristics about the match over time, and one person may know his or her true value of the match while the other does not know. I characterize the resulting equilibrium. ^ In the second paper, “A Model of Interviewing,” I develop a model of interviewing with heterogeneous workers and heterogeneous matches, in which workers have a cost to being interviewed. I establish parameters for which lower productivity workers are not willing to be interviewed, and hence have a higher payoff than some workers who are willing to be interviewed.

Follow-up has been 100 % and includes all patients for at least 1 year, and 61 patients (65 %) for 5 to 12 years. Incidence of serious risk factors <b>on</b> <b>initial</b> <b>contact</b> was: ascites, 97 %; jaundice, 86 %; portal-systemic encephalopathy including past history, 71 %; severe muscle wasting, 96 %; alcohol ingestion within 7 days, 66 %; delirium tremens, 16 %; serum albumin, {{less than or equal}} to 2. 5 g/dL 76 %; indocyanine green dye retention greater than or equal to 50 % in 45 minutes, 66 %; serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase greater than or equal to 100 units/L, 60 %; hyperdynamic cardiac output greater than or equal to 6 L/minute, 98 %. Mean Child's point score was 13. 7 out of a maximum of 15. EPCS reduced mean corrected free portal pressure from 286 to 23 mm saline, and permanently controlled variceal bleeding in every patient. Of the 94 patients, 74 (80 %) left the hospital alive and 68 (72 %) survived 1 year. Five-year actuarial survival rate is 64 %. Hepatic failure was the main cause of death during initial hospitalization as well as during follow-up, when it was related to continued alcoholism. Portal-systemic encephalopathy, which was present <b>on</b> <b>initial</b> <b>contact</b> in 55 % of patients, occurred at some time during follow-up in 18. 7 %, but was recurrent and required dietary protein restriction in only 9 %, all of whom had resumed alcoholism. The low incidence of portal-systemic encephalopathy was attributable to the lifelong program of follow-up with regular dietary counseling and continued emphasis on both protein restriction to 60 g/day and abstinence from alcohol. Abstinence was sustained in 69 %, liver function improved in 82 %, general health was judged excellent or good in 73 %, and Child's risk class converted to class B in 73 % and class A in 21 %. Excluding retirees because of age, 42 % were gainfully employed or engaged in full-time housekeeping. Long-term shunt patency was documented in 100 % of survivors by yearly angiography or Doppler ultrasonography.

40|$|Biogenic amines have {{widespread}} {{effects on}} numerous behaviors, but their natural functions are often unclear. We investigated {{the role of}} octopamine (OA), the invertebrate analogue of noradrenaline, on initiation and maintenance of aggression in male crickets of different social status. The key-releasing stimulus for aggression is antennal fencing between males, a behavior occurring naturally <b>on</b> <b>initial</b> <b>contact.</b> We show that mechanical antennal stimulation (AS) alone is sufficient to initiate an aggressive response (mandible threat display). The efficacy of AS was augmented in winners of a previous fight, but unaffected in losers. The efficacy of AS was not, however, influenced by OA receptor (OAR) agonists or antagonists, regardless of social status. Additional experiments indicate that the efficacy of AS is also not influenced by dopamine (DA) or serotonin (5 HT). In addition to initiating an aggressive response, prior AS enhanced aggression exhibited in subsequent fights, whereby AS with a male antenna was now necessary, indicating a role for male contact pheromones. This priming effect of male-AS on subsequent aggression was dependent on OA since it was blocked by OAR-antagonists, and enhanced by OAR-agonists. Together our data reveal that neither OA, DA nor 5 HT are required for initiating aggression in crickets, nor do these amines influence {{the efficacy of the}} natural releasing stimulus to initiate aggression. OA’s natural function is restricted to promoting escalation and maintenance of aggression once initiated, and this can be invoked by numerous experiences, including prior contact with a male antenna as shown here...|$|E

For friction coeffcient values smaller than an explicitly-computable limit value, every step of the iteration is shown to be a contraction.

40|$|The calcium {{sensitivity}} of vascular smooth muscle contraction and experimentally-induced desensitisation to noradrenaline were {{studied in the}} isolated perfused rat tail artery. Responses to the activators noradrenaline (NA) (3 µM) and potassium chloride (KCl) (100 mM) were obtained in Ca 2 +-buffered saline. Activators were added when [Ca 2 +] free was low (1 µM) and then [Ca 2 +] free was increased stepwise to give a Ca 2 +-concentration/response curve (CRC). There was a progressive rightward shift of the CRCs with time when a series of curves was constructed. Desensitisation was not a function of time elapsed before first testing and could be reduced by increasing the interval between CRCs, reducing [NA] or doubling [glucose]. Thus the rat tail artery exhibits higher sensitivity to Ca 2 + <b>on</b> <b>initial</b> <b>contact</b> with activators. The results suggest that desensitisation at some stage in excitation-contraction coupling, possibly by Ca 2 + overload, occurs when high extracellular [Ca 2 +] (2. 5 or 5 mM) is present during activation by NA. This can be prevented by allowing recovery through leaving longer intervals between CRCs, thus allowing prolonged reproducibility of high sensitivity to Ca 2 + which, otherwise, is lost. Desensitisation was essentially similar whether activation was by NA, 5 HT or high [KCl]. NA caused desensitisation to 5 HT more effectively than 5 HT caused desensitisation to NA. The results are discussed {{in relation to the}} experimental conditions necessary to examine the {{sensitivity of}} vascular smooth muscle contraction to extracellular calcium and noradrenaline and to the mechanisms which may underline rapid desensitisation...|$|E

However, Vi-positive isolates are more prevalent. The present study was planned to investigate comparative growth of Vi-positive and Vi-negative S. Typhi isolates in an ex vivo human whole blood model. Four isolates of each type were tested for growth in human whole blood and in an enrichment medium (Tryptic soy broth-TSB) as a control. It was found that capsulated (Vi-positive) strains formed smooth circular colonies and grew with shorter lag and generation time than Vi-negative isolates. Overall growth pattern of S. Typhi isolates both in vitro and ex vivo conditions showed that Vi-positive isolates grew at a faster rate. Especially in human blood, the lag time of acapsulated isolates was almost doubled as compared to capsulated S. Typhi isolates. It was also observed that Vi-negative isolates reduced in number up to 81 % during the first 12 hours of incubation in human whole blood. Interestingly, both types of isolates had similar growth curve in TSB indicating that Vi capsule is dispensable for bacterial growth in vitro.

In this study, we investigate how surface features influence the dissolution rate of synthesised CeO 2 and ThO 2, spent nuclear fuel analogues which approximate as closely as possible the mineral structure characteristics of fuel-grade UO 2 but are not sensitive to changes in oxidation state of the cation. The morphology of grain boundaries (natural features) and surface facets (specimen preparation-induced features) were investigated during dissolution. The effects of surface polishing on dissolution rate was also investigated. We show that preferential dissolution occurs at grain boundaries, resulting in grain boundary decohesion and enhanced dissolution rates. A strong crystallographic control was exerted, with high misorientation angle grain boundaries retreating more rapidly than those with low misorientation angles, which {{may be due to the}} accommodation of defects in the grain boundary structure. The data from these simplified analogue systems support the hypothesis that grain boundaries play a role in the so-called "instant release fraction" of spent fuel, and should be carefully considered, in conjunction with other chemical effects, in safety performance assessements for the geological disposal of spent fuel. Surface facets formed during the sample annealing process also exhibited a strong crystallographic control and were found to dissolve rapidly <b>on</b> <b>initial</b> <b>contact</b> with dissolution medium. Defects and strain induced during sample polishing caused an overestimation of the dissolution rate, by up to 3 orders of magnitude...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{previous}} years, out- of-hours {{primary care}} has been organised in large-scale organisations in many countries. This may have lowered the threshold for many patients to present health problems at nights {{and during the}} weekend. Comparisons of out-of-hours care between countries require internationally comparable figures on symptoms and diagnoses, which were not available. This study aimed to describe the symptoms and diagnoses in out-of-hours primary care services in regions in eight European countries. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study based on medical records from out-of-hours primary care services in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, and Switzerland. We aimed to include data <b>on</b> 1000 <b>initial</b> <b>contacts</b> from up to three organisations per country. Excluded were contacts with an administrative reason. The International Classification for Primary Care (ICPC) was used to categorise symptoms and diagnoses. In two countries (Slovenia and Spain) ICD 10 codes were translated into ICPC codes. Results: The age distribution of patients showed a high consistency across countries, while the percentage of males varied from 33. 7...|$|R
30|$|Thermo-physiological {{properties}} of textiles greatly determine {{the transport of}} heat, moisture vapour and liquid moisture from skin to environment through clothing and are therefore, crucial to provide comfortable microclimate to the wearer. Clothing layer worn next to skin should have two important properties: the initial and the foremost property is to absorb the perspiration from the skin surface and second property is to transfer moisture to atmosphere and make the wearer feel comfortable. Diffusion and wicking are the two means by which moisture gets transferred to the atmosphere. Concentration gradient {{is the driving force}} which causes moisture diffusion from region of high concentration to low concentration. Wicking involves the motion of liquid moisture in void spaces between fibres in a yarn (Patil et al. 2009) and is significantly affected by the liquid retention in the voids. The thermal properties along with air permeability and drying ability of textiles are equally important in determining the overall wearer comfort. Thermal resistance and thermal absorptivity—objective measure of warm–cool feeling <b>on</b> fabric’s brief <b>initial</b> skin <b>contact</b> determines the application area of fabrics. Fabrics with high thermal insulation and providing warmer feeling are preferred choice as winter wear. However, lower thermal insulation, cooler feeling <b>on</b> <b>initial</b> skin <b>contact,</b> higher air permeability and quick drying ability are the desirable properties for fabrics intended as summer wear.|$|R

Engineering fabrics with desirable thermo-physiological properties suited for specific applications such as active wear, intimate wear is a big challenge for textile manufacturers as gamut of fibre, yarn and fabric parameters are known to influence the thermo-physiological properties. The present study was undertaken with an aim to explore suitable combination of fibre and yarn variables for engineering polyester–cotton plated fabrics with good thermo-physiological properties. Categorical variables i.e. outer layer yarn type and inner layer fibre linear density were found to affect the thermal, moisture vapour and liquid moisture transfer properties of developed test samples. Fabrics knitted with carded yarn and polyester fibre of high linear density showed high thermal resistance and would feel warmer <b>on</b> <b>initial</b> skin <b>contact</b> owing to low thermal absorptivity. However, the air permeability and moisture vapour transmission rate increased with combination of combed cotton yarn in the outer and coarse polyester fibre in the inner layer. Combed yarn fabrics were superior in trans planar wicking compared to carded yarn fabrics which showed higher water absorbency and would be slow drying fabrics.|$|R
