5|$|Critically, {{the ship}} {{did not have}} a {{chronometer}} for this voyage, a comparatively new and expensive navigational instrument at the time. Captain George Simpson could not afford the 60–100 guineas for one,Hall 1820, primary sources. and the ship's owners were also unwilling to purchase <b>one,</b> <b>even</b> threatening to replace him with another captain if he refused to set sail without one.Hall 1833, primary sources.|$|E
5|$|The 11 {{extra points}} against Cumberland by Bart Sims {{is still a}} school record. The offense was led by Diddy Seibels; the defense by Ormond Simkins. John Heisman's Auburn team was the only <b>one</b> <b>even</b> to score on Sewanee.|$|E
5|$|A {{fathometer}} was {{not required}} under USCG regulations, and Fitzgerald lacked <b>one,</b> <b>even</b> though fathometers were {{available at the time}} of her sinking. Instead, a hand line was the only method Fitzgerald had to take depth soundings. The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} that those net-men wearing tunics, known as retiarii tunicati, formed a special sub-class, <b>one</b> <b>even</b> more demeaned than their loincloth-wearing colleagues. The Roman satirist Juvenal wrote that: So even the lanista's establishment is better ordered than yours, for he separates the vile from the decent, and sequesters even from their fellow-retiarii the wearers of the ill-famed tunic; in the training-school, and even in gaol, such creatures herd apart….|$|E
5|$|With Willoughby's ambush plan ruined, the {{scattered}} boats sought to rejoin Nereide, passing directly through the French squadron. Although several boats {{were in danger}} of being run down by the French ships and <b>one</b> <b>even</b> bumped alongside Minerve, all eventually rejoined Nereide safely. However, the opportunity to cause significant damage to the French in the narrow channel had been lost, with Bellone joining the squadron in passing through the channel with minimal resistance. In addition to British losses in the explosion at the fort, two men had been killed and one wounded on Nereide. French losses were more severe, Minerve suffered 23 casualties and Ceylon eight. With both sides recognising that further action was inevitable, Willoughby sent a boat to Sirius requesting additional assistance and Duperré sent a message overland with Lieutenant Morice, requesting support from Hamelin's squadron (Morice fell from his horse during the mission and was severely injured). Command of Victor passed to Henri Moisson. In the afternoon, Willoughby used mortars on Île de la Passe to shell the French squadron, forcing Duperré to retreat into the shallow harbour at Grand Port and Willoughby subsequently sent officers into Grand Port on 21 August under a flag of truce, demanding the release of Victor, which he insisted had surrendered and should thus be handed over to the blockade squadron as a prize. Duperré refused to consider the request. One French ship had failed to enter the channel off Grand Port: the captured East Indiaman Windham. Early on 21 August, her French commander attempted to shelter in Rivière Noire. Sirius spotted the merchant ship under the batteries there and sent two boats into the anchorage, stormed the ship and brought her out without a single casualty, despite the boarding party having forgotten to take any weapons with them and being only armed with wooden foot-stretchers wielded as clubs.|$|E
