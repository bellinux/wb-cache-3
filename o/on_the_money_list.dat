25|$|Zaharias had her {{greatest}} year in 1950 when she completed the Grand Slam {{of the three}} women's majors of the day: the U.S. Open, the Titleholders Championship, and the Women's Western Open, a feat that made her the leader <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>list</b> that year.

2500|$|The {{criterion}} for retaining tour cards {{at the end}} of the season also changed. Through 2012, the top 125 players <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>list</b> {{at the end of}} the PGA Tour season retained their tour cards. For the 2013 season only, the top 125 players on both the money list and the FedEx Cup points list {{at the end of the}} FedEx Cup regular season in August retained their cards. The tour also said that it would decide at a later time whether to keep this aspect of the qualifying system in place in future seasons. Otherwise, the planned move by the tour to have the top 125 players on the FedEx Cup points list retain their tour cards will take effect with the 2014 season. The next 75 players on the points list, along with the top 75 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>list</b> of the Web.com Tour at the end of that tour's regular season, will be eligible to play a series of three tournaments in September known as the Web.com Tour Finals. The Finals field, however, is not expected to consist of all 150 players, as some of the PGA Tour players will still be exempt by other criteria, such as a tournament win in the previous two years. A total of 50 PGA Tour cards for the next season will be awarded at the end of the Finals. The 25 leading money winners during the Web.com Tour regular season will receive cards, and total money earned during the Finals will determine the remaining 25 card earners. For all 50 new card earners, their positions on the PGA Tour's priority order for purposes of tournament entry will be based on money earned in the Finals. [...] College players who turn professional can enter the series if their earnings are equivalent to a top-200 PGA Tour or top-75 Web.com Tour finish.|$|E
