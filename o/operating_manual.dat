The plane's <b>operating</b> <b>manual</b> says that at an altitude of [...] the rate of climb would be 300 feet per minute (about 1.5m/s). The NTSB report says that [...] "a meteorologist from Salinas provided a numerical simulation of the conditions in the accident area using the WRF-ARW (Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting) numerical model. At 0930 [...] the model displayed downdrafts in that area of approximately 300 feet per minute." [...] There was no evidence of equipment failure. The report stated that a postmortem examination of the skeletal fragments had been performed {{under the auspices of the}} Madera County Sheriff's Department. The cause of death was determined to be multiple traumatic injuries. The ELT was destroyed by the crash.|$|E

He converted one of the Factory bathrooms into a darkroom, where he learned to process film. This, combined with his background in lighting and experimental approach to his work, resulted in a body of work which captured the [...] "silver years" [...] at the Factory (1963–70). Name's close friendship with Warhol - and his role in creating Warhol's artistic environment - provided him with a unique perspective of the Factory, with a particular focus on a core group of [...] "superstars", who largely improvised before the camera.|$|E

2500|$|Lord Brabazon {{reported}} first, in February 1951, {{making a}} number of recommendations regarding the lighting of airfields in poor weather conditions, the measurement of visibility and the setting of minimum weather conditions for landing.

It was also noted that BEA's <b>operating</b> <b>manual</b> was confusing as to whether the decision heights stated were compulsory or advisory only, and Monckton recommended that aircraft be prohibited from landing where the visibility was significantly below the minimum conditions set by the operator.

40|$|Effective plant <b>operating</b> <b>manuals</b> used in {{a formal}} {{training}} program {{can make the difference}} between a successful operation and a failure. Once the plant process design and control strategies have been fixed, equipment has been ordered, and the plant is constructed, the only major variable affecting success is the capability of plant operating personnel. It is essential that the myriad details concerning plant operation are documented in comprehensive <b>operating</b> <b>manuals</b> suitable for training the non-technical personnel that will operate the plant. These manuals must cover the fundamental principles of each unit operation including how each operates, what process variables are important, and the impact of each variable on the overall process. In addition, operators must know the process control strategies, process interlocks, how to respond to alarms, each of the detailed procedures required to start up and optimize the plant, and every control loop-including when it is appropriate to take manual control. More than anything else, operating mistakes during the start-up phase can lead to substantial delays in achieving design processing rates as well as to problems with government authorities if environmental permit limits are exceeded. The only way to assure return on plant investment is to ensure plant operators have the knowledge to properly run the plant from the outset. A comprehensive set of <b>operating</b> <b>manuals</b> specifically targeted toward plant operators and supervisors written by experienced operating personnel is the only effective way to provide the necessary information for formal start-up training...|$|R
