5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are {{the centerpiece}} of general relativity. They provide a precise formulation {{of the relationship between}} spacetime geometry and the properties of matter, using the language of mathematics. More concretely, they are formulated using the concepts of Riemannian geometry, in which the geometric properties <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>space</b> (or a spacetime) are described by a quantity called a metric. The metric encodes the information needed to compute the fundamental geometric notions of distance and angle in a curved space (or spacetime).|$|E

5|$|The Serre {{spectral}} sequence {{was used}} by Serre to prove some of the results mentioned previously. He used the fact that taking the loop space of a well behaved space shifts all the homotopy groups down by 1, so the nth homotopy group <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>space</b> X is the first homotopy group of its (n−1)-fold repeated loop space, which {{is equal to the}} first homology group of the (n−1)-fold loop space by the Hurewicz theorem. This reduces the calculation of homotopy groups of X to the calculation of homology groups of its repeated loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence relates the homology <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>space</b> to that of its loop space, so can sometimes be used to calculate the homology of loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence tends to have many non-zero differentials, which are hard to control, and too many ambiguities appear for higher homotopy groups. Consequently, it has been superseded by more powerful spectral sequences with fewer non-zero differentials, which give more information.|$|E
5|$|For {{surfaces}} in higher dimensions, {{there is more}} than one definition of curvature, including extrinsic (embedding-dependent) measures such as the mean curvature and intrinsic measures such as the Gaussian curvature and Ricci curvature. Correspondingly, there are several ways of defining geometric flows based on curvature, including the mean curvature flow (in which the normal speed of an embedded surface is its mean curvature), the Ricci flow (an intrinsic flow on the metric <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>space</b> based on its Ricci curvature) and the Willmore flow (the gradient flow for an energy functional combining the mean curvature and Gaussian curvature). The curve-shortening flow is a special case of the mean curvature flow for one-dimensional curves.|$|E

5|$|Japanese {{architecture}} {{is a combination}} between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. Sliding doors (fusuma) were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>space</b> to be customized for different occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design, and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{fundamental}} group or the higher homotopy groups <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>space,</b> homology groups are important topological invariants. Although some (co)homology theories are computable using tools of linear algebra, many other important (co)homology theories, especially singular (co)homology, are not computable directly from their definition for nontrivial spaces. For singular (co)homology, the singular (co)chains and (co)cycles groups are often {{too big to}} handle directly. More subtle and indirect approaches become necessary. The Mayer–Vietoris sequence is such an approach, giving partial information about the (co)homology groups of any space by relating it to the (co)homology groups of two of its subspaces and their intersection.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor, Ian, and Barbara {{are still}} missing the Doctor's granddaughter Susan when the TARDIS lands on a planet the Doctor {{eventually}} recognises as Dido, a world he has visited before. The trio soon encounter two survivors <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>space</b> crash, Vicki and Bennett, who are awaiting a rescue ship that is due to arrive in three days time. Vicki and Bennett live in fear of Koquillion, a bipedal inhabitant of Dido, who is stalking the area. Koquillion encounters the time travellers and attacks, pushing Barbara over a cliff and temporarily trapping Ian and the Doctor. Vicki finds Barbara injured and rescues her from Koquillion, and they share reminiscences. Vicki's father was amongst those who died when {{the survivors of the}} crash, save Bennett and Vicki, were lured to their deaths by the natives of Dido. She is evidently very lonely, having befriended an indigenous Sand Beast for company. However, when Ian and the Doctor reach the ship, tempers are fraught because Barbara mistook the Sand Beast for a threat and killed it.|$|E

It is well known that every sequence-covering mapping is pseudo-sequence-covering, and if the domain is metric, every pseudo-sequence-covering mapping is sequentially-quotient[4]. But none of these implications can be reversed. This leads us to investigate images of metric spaces under these mappings. In [10], S.
