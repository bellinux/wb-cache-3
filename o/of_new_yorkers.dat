25|$|According to a NY1 news poll, 41% <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> thought {{both the}} MTA and the Transport Workers Union were {{to blame for}} the strike. About 27% solely faulted the MTA, while 25% blamed the union for the walkout. 54% <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> thought what the union wanted was fair {{compared}} to 36% who did not. But race was also shown to play into this result: 38% of white New Yorkers thought the TWU's demands were fair, while nearly three-quarters of both African-Americans and Latinos agreed with the TWU's proposals. Three times as many white New Yorkers said the union is more {{to blame for the}} strike than did African-American New Yorkers.|$|E

Giuliani ran an aggressive campaign, parlaying his image as a tough leader who had cleaned up the city. Giuliani's popularity was at its highest point to date, with a late October 1997 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll showing him as having a 68 percent approval rating; 70 percent <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> were satisfied with life {{in the city and}} 64 percent said things were better in the city compared to four years previously.|$|E

25|$|Polls {{showed that}} the {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> wanted the state's death penalty laws restored. A bill to restore the death penalty passed the Legislature several years in a row, only to be vetoed by Mario Cuomo. Pataki made the issue a top priority of his and when the bill reached his desk he signed it into law in 1995. The state's Court of Appeals later ruled the death penalty unconstitutional in the form {{in which it was}} written (in the case of People v. LaValle), and the State Legislature has not passed a bill to restore it in a new form. During Pataki's 12 years as governor, not a single person was executed in New York State.|$|E

It treated victims of the cholera epidemic of 1849 and of the Hudson River landing of US Airways Flight 1549. It was the designated provider for New York and New Jersey members of the U.S. Department of Defense Health Plan. Over time it expanded to become a major medical and research center. It maintained its connection to the Roman Catholic tradition, and was sponsored by the Bishop of Brooklyn and the President of the Sisters of Charity of New York.|$|E
25|$|John H.

Starin owned the largest fleet of steamboats in Manhattan and utilized his fleet to carry thousands <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> to the park each year. Features of the park included beaches and bathing pavilions, gardens, German beer garden, Grand Cafe, Chinese pagoda, bridle paths, a miniature steam train, natural history museum, aviary, and a zoo of exotic animals which included lions, elephants and trained seals. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the park was that all attractions, rides and amusements were free.|$|E

25|$|An August 2007 Quinnipiac University {{poll found}} that New York City voters opposed the plan 57% to 36%. Most of the {{opposition}} came from the outer boroughs, which {{with the exception of}} the Bronx would lose their toll-free access under the plan. On the other hand, 58% of voters would support the plan if the funds were used toward improving mass transit. A subsequent poll in March 2008 found that New York City voters supported Congestion Pricing by a margin of 67 percent to 27 percent if the money were used for mass transit improvements, and statewide voters supported the plan 60% to 30%, although the majority <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> were unaware that a $1 taxi surcharge was included in the plan. Then-presidential candidate Barack Obama, scores of city and state legislators, and community leaders openly expressed support for the plan.|$|E
25|$|Public {{transport}} {{is essential}} in New York City. 54.6% <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> commuted to work in 2005 using mass transit. This {{is in contrast to}} the rest of the United States, where about 90% of commuters drive automobiles to their workplace. According to the New York City Comptroller, workers in the New York City area spend an average of 6 hours and 18 minutes getting to work each week, the longest commute time in the nation among large cities. New York is the only US city in which a majority (52%) of households do not have a car; only 22% of Manhattanites own a car. Due to their high usage of mass transit, New Yorkers spend less of their household income on transportation than the national average, saving $19 billion annually on transportation compared to other urban Americans.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Bloomberg Businessweek placed George Pataki {{among the}} 20 {{individuals}} it commended for their personal efforts to combat global warming, citing his Greenhouse Gas Task Force {{and efforts to}} increase New York's usage of renewable energies. In 1996, Pataki oversaw the creation and passage of the Clean Water/Clean Air Environmental Bond Act. The act put forth $1.75 billion for over 2,200 environmentally minded projects throughout the state. Projects were focused on improving drinking water quality, closing landfills, investing in recycling programs, cleaning up New York's polluted waterways, funding cleanup of Brownfields and clean-air projects. During his tenure, Pataki added over 1 million acres to {{the entirety of the}} protected open spaces of New York. He also worked to protect the drinking water of millions <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> through the Catskill Watershed Agreement. Through the agreement, the numerous small communities that surround the 19 reservoirs that provide drinking water for New York City received $1 billion in aid to assuage environmental issues and promote local development in return for accepting higher standards of environmental regulations to better protect the reservoirs. On Pataki's final day in office, The New York Times ran an editorial evaluating his twelve years as governor and praised his work on the environment.|$|E
