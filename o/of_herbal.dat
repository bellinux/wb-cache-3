40|$|ABSTRACT: Our {{ancestor}} {{found that}} some <b>of</b> the Chinese <b>herbal</b> drugs were toxic during their clinical practice. They graded the toxicity <b>of</b> Chinese <b>herbal</b> drugs into three degrees and thought that the term "toxicity <b>of</b> the Chinese <b>herbal</b> drugs" {{could be used in}} a broad and a narrow sense. In modern times, toxic components <b>of</b> the Chinese <b>herbal</b> drugs and their toxic mechanisms, especially the toxicity on the kidney, were further revealed. The factors that affect the toxicity <b>of</b> the Chinese <b>herbal</b> drugs include the species, preparation, dose and environment. To prevent the toxicity <b>of</b> the Chinese <b>herbal</b> drugs, we must strengthen the management <b>of</b> the Chinese <b>herbal</b> drugs. On the other hand, doctors' recognition of the toxicity <b>of</b> Chinese <b>herbal</b> drugs should be enhanced. At the same time, patients should be told to decoct and take Chinese herbal drugs correctl...|$|R

5|$|Medicinal {{plants are}} often tough and fibrous, {{requiring}} {{some form of}} preparation to make them convenient to administer. According to the Institute for Traditional Medicine, common methods for the preparation <b>of</b> <b>herbal</b> medicines include decoction, powdering, and extraction with alcohol, in each case yielding a mixture of substances. Decoction involves crushing and then boiling the plant material in water to produce a liquid extract. Powdering involves drying the plant material and then crushing it to yield a powder that can be compressed into tablets. Alcohol extraction involves soaking the plant material in cold wine or distilled spirit to form a tincture.|$|E

5|$|In {{the era of}} Ottoman rule, and {{especially}} from the 17th to the 19th century, the local Greek Orthodox communities were granted special privileges by the Ottoman authorities. At that time the area of Zagori acquired an autonomous status inside the Ottoman Empire, whereby the locals were exempt from the fiscal extortion that crippled the more prosperous lowland communities. During this period large groups of villagers emigrated to metropolitan centers. Many among them became members of successful professional classes before finally returning to their home villages, endowing the region with wealth and building luxurious mansions. In such an environment, the art <b>of</b> <b>herbal</b> healing by the so-called Vikos doctors developed and flourished. This was accompanied by an impressive cultural and intellectual life that produced many renowned scholars and benefactors of Greece.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in the Arab world, by 900 {{the great}} Greek herbals had been {{translated}} and copies lodged in centres {{of learning in}} the Byzantine empire of the eastern Mediterranean including Byzantium, Damascus, Cairo and Baghdad where they were combined with the botanical and pharmacological lore of the Orient. In the medieval Islamic world, Muslim botanists and Muslim physicians made a major contribution to the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>herbal</b> medicines. Those associated with this period include Mesue Maior (Masawaiyh, 777–857) who, in his Opera Medicinalia, synthesised the knowledge of Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Indians and Babylonians, this work was complemented by the medical encyclopaedia of Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980–1037). Avicenna’s Canon of Medicine was used for centuries in both East and West. During this period Islamic science protected classical botanical knowledge that had been ignored in the West and Muslim pharmacy thrived.|$|E
5|$|In modern medicine, {{around a}} quarter of the drugs {{prescribed}} to patients are derived from medicinal plants, and they are rigorously tested. In other systems of medicine, medicinal plants may constitute the majority of what are often informal attempted treatments, not tested scientifically. Medicinal plant use ranges from the mainstream, where some of the drugs used are derived from plants, to traditional medicine where plants form the bulk of the substances administered. The World Health Organization estimates, without reliable data, that some 80 percent of the world's population depends mainly on traditional medicine (including but not limited to plants); perhaps some two billion people are largely reliant on medicinal plants. The use of plant-based materials including herbal remedies and so-called nutraceuticals, foods with supposed health benefits, is increasing quickly in developed countries. This brings attendant risks of toxicity and other effects on human health, despite the safe image <b>of</b> <b>herbal</b> remedies. Herbal medicines have been in use since long before modern medicine existed; there was and often still is little or no knowledge of the pharmacological basis of their actions, if any, or of their safety. The World Health Organization formulated a policy on traditional medicine in 1991, and since then has published guidelines for them, with a series of monographs on widely used herbal medicines.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the racial/ethnic {{differences}} in self- reported health problems and herbal use as a self-care practice between white American and African-American older women, and between herbal users and nonusers. Two data sets collected in 1998 and 2002 were combined to perform this study. The total sample (143 participants) consisted of 85 white Americans and 58 African-American women > or = 65 years, living independently in the community. While there were statistically significant differences in education (chi-squared = 19. 085, p= 0. 0001) and annual income (chi-squared = 21. 905, p= 0. 0001) between white American and African-American women, no differences were found in the use <b>of</b> <b>herbals</b> between the two groups.
