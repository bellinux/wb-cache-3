The majority of the decedents were Caucasian men who drowned while fishing. CONCLUSIONS. This study emphasizes that fishing is a dangerous industry in Alaska and demonstrates the benefit of using multiple data sources to identify fishing-related deaths in the state...|$|R

This is a retrospective study {{using data from}} the Alaska Occupational Surveillance System (AOISS), a database with records from all <b>occupational</b> <b>mortalities</b> occurring in Alaska from 1990 on.

There were 228 deaths resulting from cold-water immersion and subsequent drowning in the target population for the time period studied. Victims were far less likely to have used PFDs than were survivors of events where cold-water drowning occurred. Conclusion. The strong protective association seen with the use of PFDs, particularly immersion suits, in surviving cold-water events indicates that many of the events that led to deaths in the tar-get population could well have been survivable...|$|R

Methods The study applied methods {{developed by the}} Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (CSTE/NIOSH) Occupational Health Indicator Work Group and compared the relative strength and weakness of two different datasets (CFOI and NMVRHS) for occupational injury fatality surveillance. Results Annual <b>occupational</b> injury <b>mortality</b> rates ranged from 4. 4 to 7. 6 per 100, 000 employed persons aged 16 and over compared to annual US rates of 4. 0 – 4. 6 per 100, 000. Risk factors for higher mortality rates included age over 65 years, self-employment, non-US citizenship, being African-American or Hispanic, and occurrence in rural counties. The top industry for fatality rate was mining followed by transportation, public utilities, agriculture, and construction.

40|$|SUMMARY For {{more than}} 100 years the Registrar General has {{reviewed}} mortality in depth {{in a series}} of supplements relating extra information provided by decennial censuses to deaths in a period before and after the census. The volume describing <b>occupational</b> <b>mortality</b> in 1970 - 72 was recently published (Registrar General, 1978). Here we consider in more detail one of the questions raised by <b>occupational</b> <b>mortality</b> studies: how much does mortality of an occupation group reflect work environment and how much way of life? We first describe the traditional method of distinguishing these direct and indirect influences (that is, the comparison of the mortality of men following an occupation with that of their wives) and then introduce an alternative which we call 'social class standardisation'...|$|E

40|$|<b>Occupational</b> <b>mortality</b> {{in women}} who died in England and Wales from 1970 to 1972 was analysed. Many of the {{associations}} found were consistent with {{those that have been}} described for men, with high mortality ratios for cirrhosis in barmaids and publicans, for suicide in the medical and allied professions, and for respiratory disease in textile workers. Parity is a determinant of patterns of disease in working women, and the relative excess of cancer of the breast, ovary, and uterine body in professional and clerical workers probably reflected the high proportion of nulliparous women in these groups. Other associations may have reflected true occupational hazards; one observation requiring further attention was the high proportional mortality ratio for anaemia in textile and clothing workers. The description of the <b>occupational</b> <b>mortality</b> among women in England and Wales is hampered by the incomplete recording of information about women's occupations at registration of death.

40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} novel {{bottom-up}} {{approach to the}} bounding of low-dose human cancer risks from chemical exposures that does not rely at all upon high-dose data for human or animal cancers. This approach can thus be used to provide an independent “reality check” on low-dose risk estimates derived with dose-response models that are fit to high-dose cancer data. The approach (1) {{is consistent with the}} “additivity to background” concept, (2) yields central and upper-bound risk estimates that are linear at all doses, and (3) requires only information regarding background risk, background (endogenous) exposure, and the additional exogenous exposure of interest in order to be implemented. After describing the details of this bottom-up approach, we illustrate its application using formaldehyde as an example. Results indicate that recent top-down risk extrapolations from <b>occupational</b> cohort <b>mortality</b> data for workers exposed to formaldehyde are overly conservative by substantial margins...|$|R
