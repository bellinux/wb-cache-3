5|$|A {{call for}} unity was his {{emotional}} {{response to the}} question. Coming down to earth, he proposed two concrete policies as steps towards its ultimate realisation - expansion of a pan-South African railway system, fostering greater commercial links and binding the region together, combined with {{the elimination of all}} regional tariffs and trade barriers with the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>South</b> African customs union.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, the {{proposed}} visit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>South</b> African team to England was subject of widespread public opposition. The MCC {{was no longer}} solely responsible for any decisions, being {{only a part of}} the Cricket Council, but Allen pressed the government to intervene and decide whether the tour should go ahead. He believed it was a political matter outside the scope of cricket authorities; the government eventually became involved and the tour was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|It {{was once}} {{believed}} that the Central American squirrel monkey was just a population <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>South</b> American species of squirrel monkey brought to Central America by humans. Evidence for this theory included the very small range of the Central American squirrel monkey and the large gap from the range of any other squirrel monkey species. A study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA demonstrated that the Central American squirrel monkey is indeed a separate species that apparently diverged from the South American species long ago – at least 260,000 years ago and possibly more than 4 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|The Indonesian film {{historian}} Misbach Yusa Biran records Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman as {{a commercial}} success. Critical reviews, however, were mixed. An anonymous reviewer in the Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad praised {{the quality of the}} film, particularly its cinematography, acting, and story. In the Malayan magazine Film Melayu, a reviewer considered the film of similar quality to Hollywood productions and praised its casting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>South</b> East Asian as the titular detective. The critic and filmwriter Saeroen expressed concern that the film's success was not because of its quality, and opined that it was only popular because of Wijnhamer's fame.|$|E
5|$|The first {{continental}} competition organised by CONMEBOL, {{the governing}} body of football in South America, was the 1960 Copa Libertadores. Before this official tournament, Chilean club Colo-Colo's President Robinson Alvarez {{had the idea}} for a South American Championship of Champions, which was eventually held in Santiago in 1948. In 1958, the new CONMEBOL president, José Ramos de Freitas, contacted South American football associations intending to introduce an annual competition for clubs on the continent. The following year, at a CONMEBOL congress in Caracas, the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>South</b> American Champions Cup was decided, renamed as Copa Libertadores in honour of the heroes of South American liberation.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} part of {{the south}} nave, the oldest section of the present structure, dates from medieval times; the north doorway and tracery (patterns of stonework in the windows) point to the 14th century. In about 1500, the church was enlarged by the addition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>south</b> porch and a second nave to the north. An arcade (row of arches) was constructed between the two naves. Enlargement by adding a second nave was not as common in Anglesey as elsewhere in Wales. Llanidan {{is one of three}} examples on the island; the others are St Beuno's, Aberffraw and St Cwyfan's, Llangwyfan). It is uncertain whether St Nidan's was enlarged because of a growth in the numbers attending the church or because of the generosity of a benefactor.|$|E

5|$|The La Colonia Formation {{is exposed}} over the {{southern}} {{slope of the}} North Patagonian Massif. Most vertebrate fossils, including Carnotaurus, come from the formation's middle section (called the middle facies association). This part likely represents the deposits of an environment of estuaries, tidal flats or coastal plains. The climate would have been seasonal with both dry and humid periods. The most common vertebrates collected include ceratodontid lungfish, turtles, crocodiles, plesiosaurs, dinosaurs, lizards, snakes and mammals. Some of the snakes {{that have been found}} belong to the families Boidae and Madtsoidae, such as Alamitophis argentinus. Turtles are represented by at least five taxa, four from Chelidae (Pleurodira) and one from Meiolaniidae (Cryptodira). Among the marine reptiles is the plesiosaur Sulcusuchus erraini of the family Polycotylidae. Mammals are represented with Reigitherium bunodontum, which was considered the first record <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>South</b> American docodont, and Argentodites coloniensis, possibly of Multituberculata. In 2011, the discovery of a new enantiornithine bird from the La Colonia Formation was announced.|$|E
