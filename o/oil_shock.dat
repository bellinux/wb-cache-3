5|$|Economists became {{interested}} in hysteresis when unemployment levels spiked with the 1979 <b>oil</b> <b>shock</b> and early 1980s recessions but {{did not return to}} the lower levels that had been considered the natural rate. Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers (1986) explained hysteresis in unemployment with insider-outsider models, which were also proposed by of Assar Lindbeck and Dennis Snower in a series of papers and then a book. Insiders, employees already working at a firm, are only concerned about their own welfare. They would rather keep their wages high than cut pay and expand employment. The unemployed, outsiders, do not have any voice in the wage bargaining process, so their interests are not represented. When unemployment increases, the number of outsiders increases as well. Even after the economy has recovered, outsiders continue to be disenfranchised from the bargaining process. The larger pool of outsiders created by periods of economic retraction can lead to persistently higher levels of unemployment. The presence of hysteresis in the labor market also raises the importance of monetary and fiscal policy. If temporary downturns in the economy can create long term increases in unemployment, stabilization policies do more than provide temporary relief; they prevent short term shocks from becoming long term increases in unemployment.|$|E

With the trade balance under pressure, the <b>oil</b> <b>shock</b> led to a sharply higher import bill. Brazil opted to continue a high-growth policy. Furthermore, it adopted renewed strategies of import substitution industrialization and of economic diversification. In the mid-1970s, the regime began implementing a development plan aimed at increasing self-sufficiency in many sectors and creating new comparative advantages. Its main components were to promote import substitution of basic industrial inputs (steel, aluminium, fertilizers, petrochemicals), to make large investments in the expansion of the economic infrastructure, and to promote exports.|$|E

40|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>shocks</b> are unobserved variables. The {{impacts of}} <b>oil</b> <b>shocks</b> on {{macroeconomic}} variables {{may be different}} on how they are defined. <b>Oil</b> <b>shocks</b> are defined as both a price and an oil production shortfall criterion. This paper seeks to compare and analyze the impacts that <b>oil</b> <b>shocks</b> as defined by these criterion, have on macroeconomic variables, such as, domestic economic growth and inflation. In particular, the asymmetric response of macroeconomic variables {{to the nature of}} <b>oil</b> <b>shocks</b> is investigated. Multivariate structural VAR analysis is carried out using both linear and nonlinear models. The latter category includes three approaches employed in the literature, namely, the asymmetric, scaled and net specifications. Empirical analysis shows that <b>oil</b> price <b>shocks</b> have an asymmetric effect on macroeconomic variables. In the case of <b>oil</b> price increase <b>shocks,</b> it reduces economic growth and increases the inflation rate, but <b>oil</b> price decrease <b>shocks</b> do not have any significant effects on these variables.

40|$|This paper investigates how {{monetary}} policy should react to <b>oil</b> <b>shocks</b> in a microfounded model with staggered price-setting and oil as a non-produced input {{in the production}} function. We extend Benigno and Woodford (2005) to obtain a second order approximation to the expected utility of the representative household when the steady state is distorted {{and the economy is}} hit by <b>oil</b> price <b>shocks.</b> The main result is that <b>oil</b> price <b>shocks</b> generate a trade-off between inflation and output stabilisation when oil has low substitutability in production. Therefore, it becomes optimal to the monetary authority to stabilise partially the effects of <b>oil</b> <b>shocks</b> on inflation and some inflation is desirable. We also find, in contrast to Benigno and Woodford (2005), that this trade-off remains even when we eliminate the effects of monopolistic distortions from the steady state. Our results also shed light on how technological improvements which reduces the dependence on oil, also reduce the impact of <b>oil</b> <b>shocks</b> on the economy. This can explain why <b>oil</b> <b>shocks</b> have lower impact on inflation in the 2000 s in contrast to the 1970 s.

40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>oil</b> price <b>shocks</b> on the {{macroeconomy}} {{has received a}} great deal of attention since the 1970 Â s. Initially, many empirical studies found a significant negative effect between <b>oil</b> price <b>shocks</b> and GDP but more recently, empirical studies have reported an insignificant relationship between <b>oil</b> <b>shocks</b> and the macroeconomy. A key feature of existing research is that it applies predominantly to advanced, oil-importing countries.

Our findings showed that <b>oil</b> price <b>shocks</b> do not have a major impact on most macroeconomic variables in Nigeria.

To investigate further why the response of real variables to <b>oil</b> <b>shocks</b> has not declined over time, we focus on the motor vehicle industry, which is considered the most important channel through which <b>oil</b> <b>shocks</b> affect the economy. We find that, contrary to common perceptions, the share of motor vehicles in total U. S. goods production has shown little decline over time. Moreover, within the motor vehicle industry, the effects of <b>oil</b> <b>shocks</b> on the mix of vehicle sold and on capacity utilization appear to have been proportional in recent decades to the effects observed in the 1970 s. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{determinants}} of exchange rates have attracted considerable attention among researchers {{over the past}} several decades.

We employ a quantile regression approach to address this issue. Our results indicate that the effect of <b>oil</b> <b>shocks</b> on exchange rates is heterogeneous across quantiles. A large US depreciation or appreciation tends to heighten the effects of <b>oil</b> <b>shocks</b> on exchange rate returns. Positive <b>oil</b> demand <b>shocks</b> lead to appreciation pressures in oil-exporting countries and this result is robust across lower and upper return distributions.
