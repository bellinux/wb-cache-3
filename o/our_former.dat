The evening of our first meeting [...] played for us, at Balakirev's request, the first movement of his Symphony in G minor it proved quite to our liking; and <b>our</b> <b>former</b> opinion of him changed and gave way to a more sympathetic one, although Tchaikovsky's Conservatory training still constituted a considerable barrier between him and us.|$|E

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of this day I was taking a walk with the steward of the convent in the neighbourhood, and as we returned, towards sunset, he begged me to take some refreshment {{with him in his}} cell. Scarcely had he entered the room, when, resuming <b>our</b> <b>former</b> subject of conversation, he said: [...] "And I, too, have read a Septuagint" [...] – i.e. a copy of the Greek translation made by the Seventy. And so saying, he took down from {{the corner of the room}} a bulky kind of volume, wrapped up in a red cloth, and laid it before me. I unrolled the cover, and discovered, to my great surprise, not only those very fragments which, fifteen years before, I had taken out of the basket, but also other parts of the Old Testament, the New Testament complete, and, in addition, the Epistle of Barnabas and a part of the Shepherd of Hermas.|$|E
500|$|Around this time, the American Imagist Amy Lowell {{moved to}} London, {{determined}} to promote {{her own work}} {{and that of the}} other Imagist poets. Lowell was a wealthy heiress from Boston whose brother Abbott Lawrence Lowell was President of Harvard University from 1909-1933. [...] She loved Keats and cigars. She was also an enthusiastic champion of literary experiment who was willing to use her money to publish the group. Lowell was determined to change the method of selection from Pound's autocratic editorial attitude to a more democratic manner. This new editorial policy was stated in the Preface to the first anthology to appear under her leadership: [...] "In this new book we have followed a slightly different arrangement to that of <b>our</b> <b>former</b> Anthology. Instead of an arbitrary selection by an editor, each poet has been permitted to represent himself by the work he considers his best, the only stipulation being that it should not yet have appeared in book form." [...] The outcome was a series of Imagist anthologies under the title Some Imagist Poets. The first of these appeared in 1915, planned and assembled mainly by H.D. and Aldington. Two further issues, both edited by Lowell, were published in 1916 and 1917. These three volumes featured most of the original poets, (also including imagist poetry by the American poet John Gould Fletcher), [...] with the exception of Pound, who had tried to persuade her to drop the Imagist name from her publications and who sardonically dubbed this phase of Imagism [...] "Amy-gism".|$|E
500|$|The film {{also makes}} {{substantial}} use of chaos theory, string theory, and the butterfly effect {{to accentuate the}} lack of control that humanity as individuals possesses. Often at each stage of his life there is a scene where Nemo {{is subject to the}} whims of chance, often plunging into water, a place where humans lack all control. This is a visual symbol of the powerlessness attributed to the human condition. The theories are used to compound reality in the film, it is why the smoke never goes back into the cigarette, time is always moving in one direction. [...] At the end when it assumes that the universe is on the precipice of ultimate chaos, making use of the Big Crunch theory, time halts, and it begins to reverse. Thus signalling the absolute freedom Nemo had been seeking – being able to live a life without choice, for while you never choose all things remain possible. The tale of Nemo Nobody reflects a life of choices, whether or not we made the correct choice and what would happen if we could go back and change them. In the reveal Mr. Nobody age 118 states that it doesn't matter what we choose, because each choice, once made has just as much significance as any alternate choice. The film portrays a life where we are all subject to chance, to the dimensions by which we construct our reality (height, length, width and time), and to the imagination of <b>our</b> <b>former</b> selves. And once the boy Nemo knows the outcomes of either choice, he instinctively opts for another.|$|E

He was with us for seven years and he meant a lot to this franchise, so it's going to be fun seeing him again but once the game gets going we want the two points, and so does he".

2500|$|Horthy also renewed peace feelers to the Allies {{and began}} {{considering}} strategies for surrendering to the Allied force he distrusted the most: the Red Army. [...] As bitterly anti-Communist as Horthy was, {{his dealings with}} the Nazis led him {{to conclude that the}} Communists were the far lesser evil. [...] Working through his trustworthy General Béla Miklós, who was in contact with Soviet forces in eastern Hungary, Horthy sought to surrender to the Soviets while preserving the Hungarian government's autonomy. The Soviets willingly promised this, and on 11 October Horthy and the Soviets finally agreed to surrender terms. [...] On 15 October 1944, Horthy told his government ministers that Hungary had signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. He said, [...] "It is clear today that Germany has lost the war... Hungary has accordingly concluded a preliminary armistice with Russia, and will cease all hostilities against her."

I could not have lived again at Alt na Guithasach now, alone, & it is far better to have built a totally new house, but the sad thought struck me, that it was the first widow's house, – not blessed by him."

2500|$|On February 4, 1896, the Court of Appeals {{overturned}} the writ. The Court of Appeals {{agreed that the}} Act of December 21, 1893, clearly ordered the District of Columbia to open North Capitol Street. [...] This command was not discretionary. The question was whether, and to what extent, the Act of August 7, 1895, repealed or altered this intent of Congress. The court was {{highly critical of the}} language of the Act of August 7. [...] It was [...] "most unwisely and improvidently drawn by some one who gave but little thought to it, and was undoubtedly passed without consideration; and in <b>our</b> <b>former</b> opinion, when its provisions were pressed upon our attention, we were compelled to disregard them". Even so, the court held, the Act of August 7, 1895, acted as a repeal of the Act of December 21, 1893. This left the method of condemnation specified {{in the second part of}} the Act of August 7 inconsistent and unenforceable. But with the requirement to open North Capitol Street now repealed, the commissioners were not obliged to take the land. The only way to interpret the Act of August 7, the court of appeals concluded, was to assume that Congress had withdrawn from the attempt at condemnation. No writ should issue, as the city commissioners had the right to refuse to take the land.|$|E
