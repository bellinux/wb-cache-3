5|$|The first {{project to}} {{describe}} {{the shape of the}} Milky Way and the position of the Sun was undertaken by William Herschel in 1785 by counting the number of stars in different regions of the sky. He produced a diagram of the shape of the galaxy with the Solar System close to the center. Using a refined approach, Kapteyn in 1920 arrived at the picture of a small (diameter about 15kiloparsecs) ellipsoid galaxy with the Sun close to the center. A different method by Harlow Shapley based on the cataloguing of globular clusters led to a radically different picture: a flat disk with diameter approximately 70kiloparsecs and the Sun far from the center. Both analyses failed {{to take into account the}} absorption of light by interstellar dust present in the galactic plane, but after Robert Julius Trumpler quantified this effect in 1930 by studying open clusters, the present picture of <b>our</b> <b>host</b> galaxy, the Milky Way, emerged.|$|E
25|$|When Dr Johnson and I were by {{ourselves}} at night, I observed of <b>our</b> <b>host,</b> aspectum generosum habet. Et generosum animum, he added. For {{fear of being}} overheard in the small Highland houses, I often talked to him in such Latin as I could speak, and with {{as much of the}} English accent as I could assume, {{so as not to be}} understood, in case our conversation should be too loud for the space.|$|E
60|$|Our {{dinner was}} over. Both Mabane and myself had {{declined}} dessert. <b>Our</b> <b>host</b> rose.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{anxious about}} that bandit," [...] he said. [...] "It {{is not his}} power of {{recovering}} I am afraid of, but <b>our</b> <b>host's</b> willingness {{to take care of}} him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beware, Saracen," [...] he said; [...] "methinks <b>our</b> <b>host's</b> {{imagination}} wanders {{as well on}} {{the subject}} of names as upon other matters. Thy name is Sheerkohf, and he called thee but now by another." ...|$|R
6000|$|Five {{years ago}} and we might have feared them; [...] Now, when they lift the laurelled brow, [...] There shall naught go up from <b>our</b> <b>hosts</b> {{assembled}} [...] But a laugh like thunder. We know them now.|$|R
60|$|MRS. COADE. IS {{it quite}} fair to Lob? After all, he is <b>our</b> <b>host.</b>|$|E
60|$|Now, in thus nocturnally regaling us, <b>our</b> <b>host</b> was {{warranted}} by many {{ancient and}} illustrious examples.|$|E
60|$|<b>Our</b> <b>host</b> {{recovered}} {{his good}} humor. He took a wooden stool, and seated himself by Cristel.|$|E
6000|$|... "We must {{chance it}} now," [...] he said. [...] "If all goes well, {{we ought to}} reach the port {{two or three hours}} before dawn and <b>our</b> <b>hosts</b> won't miss us until the major-domo sends our breakfast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 4. <b>Our</b> <b>hosts</b> {{break off}} {{the debate in}} a towering rage; refuse coffee, and declare that the caravan of [...] "Effendíná" [...] (the Viceroy) shall not be loaded. Mohammed's feet twitch more violently as the camels are made to kneel.|$|R
60|$|Holmes was pacing up {{and down}} {{one side of the}} room whilst the old {{professor}} was talking. I observed that he was smoking with extraordinary rapidity. It was evident that he shared <b>our</b> <b>host's</b> liking for the fresh Alexandrian cigarettes.|$|R
60|$|Bewildered as I was, I obeyed my instructions, {{and went}} on {{stirring}} my tea. <b>Our</b> <b>host</b> smiled.|$|E
6000|$|... "You will understand," [...] she said, [...] "that {{not only}} <b>our</b> <b>host</b> {{but we all}} should have been sacrificed had not the {{messenger}} been rescued. He would have been compelled by threats, and if these failed by tortures, to reveal who his employer was and where he lived, {{and in that case}} a search would have been made, we should have been discovered, and our lives {{as well as that of}} <b>our</b> <b>host</b> would have paid the penalty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The next day, as we {{sat down}} to Dinner," [...] <b>our</b> <b>Host</b> in the above shining costume, [...] "he said, in English tolerably pronounced:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are getting}} {{as bad as}} the sergeant," [...] I {{answered}} impatiently. [...] "Come along when you have finished, if you're not overtired, and we'll smoke one of <b>our</b> <b>host's</b> cigars together. He left the box for us beside the big hearth in the hall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have all}} heard what {{happened}} in London yesterday," [...] he said. [...] "Now that we are here together {{and those who have}} joined us are <b>our</b> <b>host's</b> good friends, it seems opportune to wish a long and useful career to the Head of the House." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Regan, {{this is my}} brother-officer, Mr. Conway, Ralph, this is Miss Regan, <b>our</b> <b>host's</b> sister, {{although}} you would take her for his daughter. Miss Regan, Mr. Conway is most anxious to have {{the pleasure of the}} next dance with you if you are not engaged." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ye behold in me,' said <b>our</b> <b>host,</b> bowing courteously to us, 'the last of {{an ancient}} family. I am Sir Jacob Clancing of Snellaby Hall.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Our</b> <b>host</b> looked familiar, {{but as he}} {{was painted}} and wore a bonnet of eagle {{feathers}} I could not remember where I had seen him.|$|E
60|$|Landing {{at another}} {{quarter of the}} island, we journeyed up a valley called Monlova, and were soon housed in a very {{pleasant}} retreat of <b>our</b> <b>host.</b>|$|E

60|$|Now we saw countless sails of {{mackerel}} fishers abroad on the deep, one fleet in {{the north}} just pouring round the Cape, another standing down toward Chatham, and <b>our</b> <b>host's</b> son went off to join some lagging member of the first which had not yet left the Bay.|$|R
6000|$|On the {{following}} morning, Thursday, {{two of the}} party bade farewell to <b>our</b> <b>hosts</b> at the fort and started {{on one of the}} quickest possible treks, leaving our companion to proceed across country to the fort established by President Burgers, or [...] "Porocororo," [...] as the Basutus call him, at Steelport.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never," [...] replied <b>our</b> <b>host</b> {{in such a}} {{way that}} any but a fool must have {{understood}} that he desired nothing less than such a meeting.|$|E
60|$|The {{father of}} <b>our</b> <b>host,</b> Mr. Cropper, {{was one of}} the first and most {{efficient}} supporters of the cause in Liverpool; and the whole circle was composed of those who had taken a deep interest in that struggle. The wife of <b>our</b> <b>host</b> was the daughter of the celebrated Lord Chief Justice Denman, a man who, for many years, stood unrivalled, at the head of the legal mind in England, and who, with a generous ardor seldom equalled, devoted all his energies to this sacred cause.|$|E
60|$|Tidd at this {{looked very}} knowing; and as <b>our</b> <b>host</b> sank {{off to sleep}} again, pointed archly at his eyebrows, and wagged {{his head at the}} Captain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come along, Ralph; I will {{introduce}} you to <b>our</b> <b>host's</b> sister, Miss Regan. Charming creature, and lots of money. Awfully struck with your appearance. Come on, man; don't be foolish," [...] and, hooking his arm in Ralph's, he led him {{across the room to}} the lady Ralph had before noticed.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't know. Dryfoos {{thought of}} having ladies, but it seems your infallible Fulkerson {{overruled}} him. Their presence might have kept Lindau and <b>our</b> <b>host</b> in bounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is this I {{hear about}} dressing?" [...] asks <b>our</b> <b>host.</b> [...] "Dine in your frock, my good friend, and welcome, if your dress-coat {{is in the}} country." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{you never}} came {{to make friends with}} us has been a great regret to us. We should have liked so much to have seen and thanked <b>our</b> <b>host.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{agree with}} you entirely," [...] Major Forrest declared. [...] "If our friend has {{disappointed}} us at all, {{it is in the}} absence of that primitiveness which he led us to expect. One perceives that one is drinking Veuve Clicquot of a vintage year, and one suspects the nationality of <b>our</b> <b>host's</b> cook." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed as}} if the mysterious picture still held a thrall upon me. I thought also that <b>our</b> <b>host's</b> eye was turned on me with an air of curiosity. In short, I was {{conscious}} that I was the hero of the night, and felt as if every one might read it in my looks.|$|R
