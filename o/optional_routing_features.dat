50|$|All of {{the above}} <b>routing</b> <b>features</b> are {{sometimes}} referred to as static <b>routing</b> <b>features.</b> These routes are put in place and are not usually changed. If changes are required, a customer usually has several options to make changes. A customer can call the IXC or an independent RespOrg directly via a special toll-free number to make changes, or a customer may be able to make changes through direct access to the network via a dedicated terminal provided by the IXC.|$|R

50|$|Because the ITR {{had some}} {{valuable}} trackage and lineside freight customers, it was acquired in June 1956 by nine Class I railroads. These collectively continued to operate ITR as a diesel-powered short line to carry freight to the acquiring railroads. The co-owned reorganized Illinois Terminal Railroad took down its trolley wire and abandoned {{much of its}} trackage, particularly the interurban street running in towns and villages. At various points ITC track was connected to trackage of adjacent lines and was available for <b>optional</b> <b>routing.</b> For the following 25 years (1956-1981) the ITC continued to operate diesel-powered trackage north and east of St. Louis, providing freight business for the railroads that owned it. The Norfolk and Western Railway purchased its partners' interests in the Illinois Terminal Railroad on September 1, 1981, and ITC officially merged into the N&W on May 8, 1982.|$|R
40|$|This is a Design Specification for {{a gateway}} to {{interconnect}} fiber optic local area networks (LAN's). The internetworking protocols for a gateway device that will interconnect multiple local area networks are defined.

30|$|This layer routes {{the data}} and synchronizes the media and IPMS layers. It {{consists}} of the media gateway controller function (MGCF), media resource function controller (MRFC) and breakout gateway control function (BGCF). The BGCF acts as the SIP proxy, {{which is responsible for}} processing the request to route the data from the S-CSCF whenever it determines that a session cannot be established using a DNS. Furthermore, the BGCF contains the <b>routing</b> <b>features</b> based on the telephone records.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) has been {{utilized}} for wireless sensor networks, mobile ad hoc networks, interplanetary networks, pocket switched networks and suburb networks for developing region. Because of these application prospects, DTNs have received attention from academic community. Whereas {{only a few}} {{state of the art}} routing algorithms in DTNs address the problem of aborted messages due to the insufficient encounter duration. In order to reduce these aborted messages, we propose a routing framework which consists of two <b>optional</b> <b>routing</b> functions. Specifically, only one of them is activated according to the encounter angle between pairwise nodes. Besides, the copies of the undelivered message carried by most of the nodes in the network {{are more likely to be}} cleared out after successful transfer, which reduces the number of unnecessary transmissions for message delivery. By means of the priority for message transmission and deletion in case of the limited network resource, the proposed algorithm achieves the high delivery ratio with low overhead as well as less number of aborted messages due to the insufficient encounter duration, thus is more energy efficient...|$|R

Versions 5 and 8 could weed downloaded email messages individually by exact email address matches; however, there were no wildcards, boolean exclusion-filters, or <b>routing</b> <b>features</b> to facilitate this. The company opened a spamdesk to help screen spam at the servers, thus minimizing the amount of spam received by the Juno client.|$|R

40|$|Routing (and forwarding) is a core {{problem in}} {{networks}} for delivering data from one node to another. Today wireless networks are becoming popular {{because of their}} “ 3 Anys” – Any person, Anywhere and Any time. Wireless ad hoc networks are termed as mobile distributed multihop wireless networks without predetermined topology (preexisting fixed infrastructure) or central control.

50|$|On the {{technology}} front, the company released its skills-based <b>routing</b> <b>feature</b> in 2004 and in 2006, released {{a number of}} new features including AutoRoute, which allows calls to automatically be sent directly to ACD queues, support or sales personnel, individual extensions, or voicemail, based on the caller's area code, area code and prefix, or entire phone number. The company acquired Open Communication Systems in 2007, and in 2008, announced VoIP interoperability through native support for open-system VoIP peering using the SIP standard. Its VoIP announcement included mention of a collaboration with Gizmo5, which was formally unveiled in March 2009.|$|R
50|$|With VoIP {{becoming}} a predominate carrier messaging system, routing becomes available from stand alone products and hosted services. These services {{are built on}} top of the RFC 3261 3XX series messaging, which allows for stateless redirection of call signaling. These stand alone LCR systems integrate many powerful <b>routing</b> <b>features</b> such as: jurisdictional, profit margin protected routing along with standard LCR and offload routing from switching components. Other open source platforms such as OpenSER/Kamailo exist that are capable of performing redirect based routing, they are however less specifically geared toward exploiting the market niches involved in carrier telecommunications routing.|$|R
30|$|The Partitioning-Hub Location-Routing Problem (PHLRP) is a hub {{location}} problem involving graph partitioning and <b>routing</b> <b>features.</b> PHLRP {{consists of}} partitioning a given network into sub-networks, locating {{at least one}} hub in each sub-network and routing the traffic within the network at minimum cost. There are various important applications of PHLRP, such as the deployment of network routing protocol problems and the planning of freight distribution problems. In [50] we formulated this problem as an Binary Integer Linear Programming (BILP) and then investigate DCA for solving it. Preliminary numerical results are compared with the well-known commercial solver CPLEX, they show the efficiency and the superiority of DCA.|$|R

The optical router is designed to passively route the optical signal travelling {{in one direction and}} actively route the optical signal making a turn. In the case that an XY dimension-order routing is used, the passive <b>routing</b> <b>feature</b> guarantees that the maximum power consumption to route the data through the network is a constant that is independent of the network size. The fabricated device has an efficient footprint of similar to 460 x 1000 mu m(2). The routing functionality of the device is verified by using a 12. 5 -Gbit/s optical signal.

40|$|Abstract WMN is {{considered}} as a core methodology to provide mobile wireless network service with multi-hop <b>routing</b> <b>feature.</b> It has a merit {{that can be easily}} deployed by utilization of protocols for MANET. However, it has differences in supporting multiple networks and channels, network architecture, and so on. Especially, in case of routing protocols, to apply them intactly to WMN can be a cause of low performance because of do not moving mesh routers. AODV seems like suitable for WMN among the various routing protocols for MANET. However, it has a defect in scalability. In this paper, an enhanced AODV routing method for WMN was proposed. The proposed method was designed to be suitable to the architecture of WM...|$|R

50|$|Most modern non-VoIP PBXs use ISDN-PRI circuits. These are {{connected}} via T1 lines {{with the central}} office switch, replacing older analog two-way and direct inward dialing (DID) trunks. PRI is capable of delivering Calling Line Identification (CLID) in both directions so that the telephone number of an extension, rather than a companys main number, can be sent. It is still commonly used in recording studios, when a voice-over actor is in one studio (possibly telecommuting from home), but the director and producer are in a studio at another location. The ISDN protocol delivers channelized, not-over-the-Internet service, powerful call setup and <b>routing</b> <b>features,</b> faster setup and tear down, superior audio fidelity as compared to POTS (plain old telephone service), lower delay and, at higher densities, lower cost.|$|R

5000|$|The {{system was}} {{primitive}} by modern standards. It initially provided no support for Automatic Number Identification and no itemised record of calls, instead requiring subscribers to obtain expensive fixed-rate lines which included some {{number of hours}} of inbound calling from a [...] "band" [...] of one or several U.S. states or Canadian provinces. Early InWATS 800 calling lacked the complex <b>routing</b> <b>features</b> offered with modern toll-free service. After competitive carriers were allowed to compete with AT&T in establishing toll-free service, the three digit exchange following the 800 prefix was linked to a specific destination carrier and area code; the number itself corresponded to specific telephone switching offices and trunk groups. All calls went to one central destination; there was no means to place a toll-free call to another country.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has made it}} possible to build information agents that retrieve and integrate information from the World Wide Web. Although there now exist solutions for modeling Web sources, query planning, and information extraction, less attention has been given to the problem of optimizing agent execution. In this paper, we describe Theseus, an efficient agent plan execution system. Through its pipelined, dataflow-based architecture, Theseus offers a high degree of parallelism and asynchronous information <b>routing,</b> <b>features</b> that can substantially improve performance. Theseus differs from prior work in reactive planning systems and parallel databases because it gathers information from the Web, a domain where information retrieval is a problem that is network-bound and is often based on interleaved data gathering and navigation. The Theseus plan language and architecture directly address these issues, resulting in a highperformance execution system. 1. INTRODUCTION Gathering informa [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a discrete-event simulator, called QUARTS-II, {{that can be}} used for the design and analysis of routing protocols for ATM networks. This simulator shares many high-level features of the ATM Forum’s P-NNI routing protocol; topology-state advertisement, on-demand source routing, call admission control and generic call admission control, hierarchical routing, and crank-back and rerouting. Simulations can be carried out at both the call and cell levels.

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} kernel {{coordination}} language for mobile agent systems that considers as first-class citizens both the agents and the channels {{they use to}} interact with each other. Channels implement distributed, asynchronous communications with FIFO ordering and multicast <b>routing.</b> <b>Features</b> related to mobility include agent migration as well as remote cloning. Most importantly, a virtual form of channel mobility inspired by the π-calculus is also supported. This expressive feature allows mobile agents to adapt dynamically to their changing environment. The language semantics, presented formally, {{is based on a}} geometrical model named the Interaction Spaces. This provides an intuitive interpretation of the agent features and capabilities in terms of combined spatial projections and transformations. Through spatial composition, we show that standard labeled transition systems and bisimulation-based semantics may be defined above the geometry, enabling reasoning and formal verification. Finally, we describe prototype implementations of the proposed model and language...|$|R

Consequently, many solutions {{that try to}} accelerate the processing by using programmable hardware have appeared recently. TRILL protocol is implemented by devices called RBridges which introduce Layer 3 <b>routing</b> <b>features</b> into link layer and serve for communication within a data center. However connection throughput might be affected {{due to the fact}} that on each hop, processing of the TRILL header needs to be done in order to decide what is the next hop MAC address. Therefore, our idea was to offload the TRILL data plane on the programmable card in order to improve the network performance, mainly to increase the throughput and to decrease the delay.
