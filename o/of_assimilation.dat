5|$|An example <b>of</b> <b>assimilation</b> {{took place}} in Maharashtra, where a {{regional}} deity named Khandoba is a patron deity of farming and herding castes. The foremost center of worship of Khandoba in Maharashtra is in Jejuri. Khandoba has been assimilated {{as a form of}} Shiva himself, in which case he is worshipped {{in the form of a}} lingam. Khandoba's varied associations also include an identification with Surya and Karttikeya.|$|E
5|$|During the {{communist}} era, rapid urbanization {{and growth of}} heavy industry occurred. Whole villages in the coal mining areas were destroyed by the mining activity. These conditions quickened the assimilation of the Poles. Another cause <b>of</b> <b>assimilation</b> was {{the high rate of}} intermarriage. Besides Poles belonging to the minority, many more commuted across the border from Polish People's Republic to work in Czechoslovakia or {{to take advantage of the}} relative abundance of consumer goods in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} forms <b>of</b> <b>assimilation</b> {{are still at}} work today. For example, when a central {{authority}} nationalizes one language, that attaches economic and social advantages to the prestige language. As generations pass, use of the indigenous language often fades or disappears, and linguistic and cultural identity recede as well. However, some groups are seeking to revive their indigenous identities. One important political aspect of this pursuit is petitioning the government for official recognition as a separate and distinct ethnic group.|$|E

5|$|On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper {{issued a}} formal apology, {{on behalf of}} the sitting Cabinet, in front of an {{audience}} of Indigenous delegates, and in an address that was broadcast nationally on the CBC, for the past governments' policies <b>of</b> <b>assimilation.</b> The Prime Minister apologized not only for the known excesses of the residential school system, but for the creation of the system itself. Harper delivered the speech in the House of Commons; the procedural device of a Committee of the Whole was used, so that Indigenous leaders, who were not Members of Parliament, could be allowed to respond to the apology on the floor of the House.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan pursued similar reforms {{with respect}} to Indigenous Australians. In 1962, the Aboriginal Affairs Bill was {{introduced}} to liberalise constraints that had been placed on Indigenous Australians {{in the past and}} had effectively resulted in segregation. The initial proposal still retained some restrictions, placing more controls over full-blooded Aborigines. Dunstan was prominent in Labor's opposition to the double standards, and called for abolition of race-based restrictions, saying that social objectives could be achieved without explicit colour-based schemes. He was successful in forcing amendments to liberalise controls on property and the confinement of Indigenous Australians to reserves. However, his attempt to remove the different standards required of part and full-blooded Aborigines failed, as did his proposal to ensure that {{at least half of the}} members of the Aboriginal Affairs Board be Indigenous Australians. Despite the passage of the bill, restrictions remained in place and Dunstan questioned the policy <b>of</b> <b>assimilation</b> of Aborigines, which he saw as the diluting of their distinctive cultures.|$|E

The chapter considers three documents to be benchmarks in their respective fields for anyone who wishes to study them in greater depth. They are as follows: dynamic modeling of natural land surfaces, methodological aspects <b>of</b> data <b>assimilation,</b> and data assimilation applications to hydrology. The chapter introduces different elements <b>of</b> an <b>assimilation</b> system, including a few insights into the dynamic modeling of natural surfaces. Data assimilation and parameter identification, as well as their foundations, are presented from a theoretical point of view. Finally, the chapter describes more practical aspects <b>of</b> data <b>assimilation...</b>|$|R
