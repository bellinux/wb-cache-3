This allows the remote UPnP device or control point to discover and interact securely {{with any of the}} UPnP device or control points that are contained within the home <b>or</b> <b>small</b> business network. UPnP Forum has recently published the version 2 Remote Access specifications in August 2011. The key feature of this new version of the specifications is to enable seamless connection between two home <b>or</b> <b>small</b> business networks thus allowing UPnP devices or control point in a home <b>or</b> <b>small</b> business network discover and interact with UPnP device and control point in another home <b>or</b> <b>small</b> business network using existing UPnP protocols. The newly published specifications address a number of features including solution for address collision when connecting two home <b>or</b> <b>small</b> business networks together, provisioning of remote access services, network address translation, and the concept of virtual device that allows multiple devices or services to be exposed to a remote home <b>or</b> <b>small</b> business network under the framework of a single device. The purpose of this white paper is to discover these new exciting features of the latest version of the remote access specifications...|$|R

By observing the fracture morphology of the samples using a phenom scanning electron microscope (PSEM), we demonstrated that a large <b>or</b> <b>small</b> plasticity results in a large <b>or</b> <b>small</b> average height of âprojectionâ in the vein-like patterns, respectively. The results indicate that, if the height of âprojectionâ in the vein-like pattern is large <b>or</b> <b>small,</b> the absorptive plastic work is also large <b>or</b> <b>small,</b> in turn indicating that the plasticity of the corresponding metallic glasses is large <b>or</b> <b>small,</b> respectively.

In particular, fast commercial vessels such as container ships can cause major injuries or death when they collide with marine mammals. Collisions occur both with large commercial vessels and recreational boats and cause injury to whales <b>or</b> <b>smaller</b> cetaceans. The critically endangered North Atlantic right whale is particularly affected by vessel strikes. Tourism boats designed for whale and dolphin watching can also negatively impact on marine mammals by interfering with their natural behavior.|$|E
5|$|When {{the mean}} orbital period of an {{asteroid}} is an integer {{fraction of the}} orbital period of Jupiter, a mean-motion resonance with the gas giant is created that is sufficient to perturb an asteroid to new orbital elements. Asteroids that become located in the gap orbits (either primordially because of the migration of Jupiter's orbit, or due to prior perturbations or collisions) are gradually nudged into different, random orbits with a larger <b>or</b> <b>smaller</b> semi-major axis.|$|E
5|$|While {{remaining}} upright may be {{the primary}} goal of beginning riders, a bike must lean in order to maintain balance in a turn: the higher the speed <b>or</b> <b>smaller</b> the turn radius, the more lean is required. This balances the roll torque about the wheel contact patches generated by centrifugal force due to the turn with that of the gravitational force. This lean is usually produced by a momentary steering in the opposite direction, called countersteering. Countersteering skill is usually acquired by motor learning and executed via procedural memory rather than by conscious thought. Unlike other wheeled vehicles, the primary control input on bikes is steering torque, not position.|$|E

5|$|Convict {{cichlids}} {{may show}} extended biparental care and adopt unrelated young {{of the same}} species of similar <b>or</b> <b>smaller</b> body size compared to their own biological offspring. The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect, which is when the risk of predation for an individual is reduced because the group size is larger. Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are larger than the biological offspring may be a direct predatory threat to them. However, {{it has been shown that}} as the biological offspring develop and become stronger swimmers, the parents are less active about rejecting larger foreign young, but when they do reject, often foreign young are rejected before they are large enough to be perceived as a direct threat to the biological offspring. Thus, it can be concluded that the brood adoption and rejection rely more heavily on the protection of the biological offspring from differential predator instead of from larger adopted cichlids.|$|E
5|$|For {{stationary}} shots where Superman is seen flying toward or {{away from}} the camera, blue screen matte techniques were used. Reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen. While a special device made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary (save for banking his body). Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs and dolly in/dolly outs to cause him to become larger <b>or</b> <b>smaller</b> in the frame. The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve's isolated image would be 'inserted' into a matted area of a background plate shot. The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would {{give the appearance of}} flying away or toward the contents of the background plate. The disparity in lighting and color between the matted image and the background plate, the occasional presence of black matte lines (where the matte area and the matted image—in this case, Superman—do not exactly match up), and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots.|$|E
5|$|George Mack, ornithologist of the National Museum of Victoria, was {{the first}} to {{classify}} the three forms melanocephalus, cruentatus and pyrrhonotus as one species, although Richard Schodde reclassified pyrrhonotus as a hybrid from a broad hybrid zone in North Queensland; this area is bounded by the Burdekin, Endeavour and Norman Rivers. Breeding males of intermediate plumage, larger and scarlet-backed, <b>or</b> <b>smaller</b> and orange-backed, as well as forms that resemble one of the two parent subspecies, are all encountered within it. A molecular study published in 2008 focussing on the Cape York population found it was genetically closer to the eastern forest subspecies than to the Top End form. These birds became segregated around 0.27 million years ago, with some gene flow still with eastern birds.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, the {{estimated}} number of dinosaur species {{that existed in}} the Mesozoic era was estimated to be 1,543–2,468. Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous, including seed-eaters, fish-eaters, insectivores, and omnivores. While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal (as are all modern birds), some prehistoric species were quadrupeds, and others, such as Ammosaurus and Iguanodon, could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Cranial modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian traits, and some extinct species had bony armor. Although known for large size, many Mesozoic dinosaurs were human-sized <b>or</b> <b>smaller,</b> and modern birds are generally small in size. Dinosaurs today inhabit every continent, and fossils show that they had achieved global distribution by at least the early Jurassic period. Modern birds inhabit most available habitats, from terrestrial to marine, and there is evidence that some non-avian dinosaurs (such as Microraptor) could fly or at least glide, and others, such as spinosaurids, had semi-aquatic habits.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{up through}} 2012, Valve would {{manually}} select games {{to be included}} on the Steam service, generally limiting these to games that either had a major developer supporting them, <b>or</b> <b>smaller</b> studios with proven track records for Valve's purposes. Valve have sought ways to enable more games to be offered through Steam, while pulling away from manually approving games for the service, short of validating that a game runs on the platforms the publisher had indicated. Alden Kroll, {{a member of the}} Steam development team, said that Valve knows Steam is in a near-monopoly for game sales on personal computers, and the company {{does not want to be}} in a position to determine what gets sold, and thus had tried to find ways to make the process of adding games to Steam outside of their control. At the same time, Valve recognized that unfettered control of games onto the service can lead to discovery problems as well as low-quality games that are put onto the service for a cash grab.|$|E
5|$|In late Precambrian time, {{extension}} {{from a large}} {{tectonic plate}} <b>or</b> <b>smaller</b> plates moving away from Laurentia thinned its continental crust, forming large rift basins that would ultimately fail to split the continent. Eventually, this sunken region of Laurentia was flooded with a shallow seaway that extended from at least present-day Lake Superior to Glacier National Park in Montana to the Grand Canyon and the Uinta Mountains. The resulting Grand Canyon Supergroup of sedimentary units is composed of nine varied geologic formations that were laid down from 1.2billion and 740million years ago in this sea.
