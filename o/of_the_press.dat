5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> all complained that the benefits of the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> regarding that decision.|$|E

30|$|When air was injected, <b>the</b> {{temperature}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{middle layer}} was higher at <b>the</b> pressing temperature <b>of</b> 210 °C than at 190 °C. The {{internal bond strength}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boards <b>pressed</b> at 210 °C was higher than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boards <b>pressed</b> at 190 °C. A big difference in internal bond strength was observed between them. For example, the internal bond strengths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boards <b>pressed</b> at 210 and 190 °C for 8  min were 0.60 and 0.43  MPa, respectively. When the pressing temperature was raised to 230 °C, <b>the</b> temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle layer was higher than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boards <b>pressed</b> at 210 °C, but the internal bond strength did not increase.
