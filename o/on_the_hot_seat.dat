2500|$|The {{matter of}} Costa Rica placed Pallister <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> {{just days before}} the Manitoba general {{election}} 2016. On April 16, and at the request of Canadian news media outlets, The Costa Rica Star published the results of an investigation into the assets owned by Pallister in Costa Rica, which include three pieces of real estate in the upscale coastal town of Tamarindo Beach. A spokesperson for Pallister's party denied the public records investigation conducted by The Costa Rica Star, which prompted rival candidate Dave Chomiak of the New Democratic Party to call on Pallister to tell the truth about his travels and his business interests in Costa Rica.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Chiefs {{loss to the}} New York Jets in the 2007 season finale, {{general manager}} Carl Peterson {{announced}} that both he and head coach Herman Edwards {{would return to the}} Chiefs in 2008. However, team chairman Clark Hunt—who took over leadership of the Chiefs in late 2006 {{after the death of his}} father, team founder Lamar Hunt—declined to immediately comment on Peterson's status. Hunt spoke out weeks later and stated that the Chiefs were his [...] "No. 1 priority" [...] and that [...] "to have the best chance of success in 2008, having Carl here makes a lot of sense.” Hunt wanted to avoid having a new general manager come in with a new head coach, and starting from scratch again. Edwards and Peterson were considered to be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> by the press, but inside the team, both were considered to be safe unless absolutely zero progress was made in 2008. Clark Hunt had expressed his expectations of a winning Chiefs team earning a playoff berth in 2008.|$|E

50|$|After {{back-to-back}} 9-3 {{seasons at}} Miami, where expectations are {{to compete for}} a national championship every year, it was widely believed that Coker was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> proverbial <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> and needed to take the Hurricanes to a BCS bowl to keep his job. In the wake of last year's Peach Bowl loss, Coker fired four assistant coaches. During the offseason, Coker hired Rich Olson as his new offensive coordinator {{in an attempt to}} reinvigorate the Hurricane offense. Olson had previously served as Miami's offensive coordinator during the early 1990s under then-head coach Dennis Erickson.|$|R

5000|$|Expectations of the team's success {{were raised}} {{significantly}} {{for the next}} season and beyond, after the free agent acquisitions of LeBron James and Chris Bosh {{in the summer of}} 2010. After the team started off the 2010-11 season with a 9-8 record, some Heat players reportedly were [...] "frustrated" [...] with Spoelstra, and questioned if he should remain their head coach. Chris Bosh intimated that the team was being worked too hard and that the players would rather [...] "chill". LeBron James famously bumped into Spoelstra {{on his way to the}} bench during a timeout in a game. [...] These two issues, coupled with the relatively poor start to the season, put Spoelstra <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coaching <b>hot</b> <b>seat.</b> <b>The</b> team bounced-back, however, and made the playoffs while posting the second best record in the Eastern Conference. Spoelstra led the Heat to an appearance in the 2011 NBA Finals, but lost to the Dallas Mavericks in six games. After Spoelstra failed to win a championship during his first season as head coach of the [...] "big three", Heat executive Pat Riley was asked if he would consider returning to coach the team. Riley, however, turned down the idea and supported Spoelstra as the head coach going forward. Spoelstra received a $6 million contract extension in December 2011 which lasted through the 2013-14 NBA season.|$|R
40|$|Opposed to a {{conventional}} approach of using ethanol in a spark-ignition engine, this study demonstrates a potential of ethanol utilization in a diesel engine using dual-fuel combustion strategy where ethanol is {{injected into the}} intake manifold and diesel is directly injected into the combustion chamber. The main focus {{of this study is}} the effect of ethanol port fuel injector (PFI) sprays on dual-fuel combustion and emissions. Firstly, details of temporal and spatial development of ethanol PFI sprays were studied using Mie-scattering and high-speed shadowgraph imaging techniques. Momentum flux-based injection rate measurement was also performed. The influences of fuel flow-rate, injection duration, and ambient air cross-flow are of particular interest in an effort to understand ethanol PFI spray characteristics that are relevant to automobile engines. Ethanol sprays are also studied for various PFI positions to examine the potential effect of droplets-airflow interaction and wall wetting. With <b>the</b> clear understanding <b>on</b> ethanol PFI sprays, dual-fuel engine experiments were conducted for various ethanol energy ratios and PFI positions. It is found that the effect of PFI position on global phenomena such as in-cylinder pressure, apparent heat release rate and mean effective pressure is much less significant than the effect of ethanol energy fraction. However, the misfiring limit shows measurable difference such that the PFI position closer to the intake valves results in 10 % higher ethanol energy fraction than that of the further upstream position. Reduced wall-wetting due to surface boiling occurring <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> valve <b>seat</b> is suggested as a possible cause, which is consistent with 30 % lower carbon monoxide and 64 % lower unburnt hydrocarbon emissions. Detailed investigation for various ethanol energy fractions was also conducted. From the in-cylinder pressure measurements, it is found that the increased ethanol energy fraction increases the engine efficiency up to 10 % until it is limited by misfiring. The results are compared to diesel-only operation with varying injection timings in order to explain whether the increased efficiency is due to the combustion phasing or improved combustion associated with fast burning of ethanol. Further analysis of the data reveals that the latter is the primary cause for the efficiency gain. By advancing the diesel injection timing, it is found that the maximum ethanol fraction can be extended to 70 % without the misfiring problem but 20 % increase in nitrogen oxide emissions is also observed, which raises a question <b>on</b> <b>the</b> advantages of utilizing ethanol in a diesel engine. However, negligible smoke emissions are measured at ethanol energy ratio of 20 % or higher suggesting that optimization of these emissions is much easier compared with conventional diesel combustion...|$|R
50|$|With Miami {{failing to}} win a conference {{championship}} or go to a BCS bowl {{the previous two years}} and not having won a national championship since 2001, it was widely assumed that Coker would enter the 2006 season <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> and need to take Miami to a BCS bowl to keep his job.|$|E
