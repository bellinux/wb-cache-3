500|$|Opening the 2011–12 season, Cammalleri {{scored the}} first NHL regular season goal at the MTS Centre as Montreal spoiled {{the debut of}} the new Winnipeg Jets {{franchise}} with a 5–1 victory. He {{had to leave the}} game, however, after suffering a cut on his leg from the skate blade of teammate Yannick Weber. He struggled throughout {{the first part of the}} season, and with the team also losing, was booed by the fans in Montreal during a 3–0 defeat against the St. Louis Blues. Following the game, he expressed his frustration, quoted as saying: [...] "I can't accept that we will display a losing attitude as we're doing this year. We prepare for <b>our</b> <b>games</b> like losers. We play like losers. So it's no wonder why we lose." [...] The commentary sparked controversy, while the Montreal Gazette suggested later that the comments, originally spoken in English, were misrepresented after they were translated to French by Réseau des sports then translated back to English.|$|E

500|$|In her review, Petit of GameSpot {{felt there}} were misogynistic {{undertones}} {{in the treatment}} of women as [...] "strippers, prostitutes, long-suffering wives, humourless girlfriends and goofy, new-age feminists", and that the satirical representation of misogyny legitimises it. Her review was met with backlash as users responded with 20,000 largely negative comments on the webpage and a Change.org petition for her firing. Petit's comments and the backlash against them prompted a wider discussion about {{the role of women in}} Grand Theft Auto V and the gaming community's defensiveness towards criticism. Helen Lewis of The Guardian felt Petit's observations were valid, but were stigmatised by gamers who have become [...] "hyper-sensitive to criticism". Tom Hoggins of The Telegraph felt that the backlash against Petit was predicated on an audience that has become accustomed to women being [...] "shallow and sidelined" [...] in the game. Rob Fahey of GamesIndustry.biz felt that debate about games' thematic concerns could become stigmatised if gamers opposed criticism, writing, [...] "This isn't just about women—it's robbing every single one of us of the opportunity to have intelligent, interesting discussions about how our medium deals with..... complex topics..... It's frustrating, it's stupid, and it's downright boring—and it risks making <b>our</b> <b>games</b> stupid and boring too". Journalist Tom Bissell agreed with Petit's [...] "defensible position", and wrote that gamers respond to game criticism more aggressively than fans of other entertainment mediums. Over a year after publication of her review, Petit stated in her personal blog that the [...] "average straight male player" [...] opposes sociopolitical criticism of video games because Grand Theft Auto Vs satire reinforces their own worldview and [...] "political agenda". She stated that the prominence of [...] "straight white men" [...] in online forums marginalises women, different ethnic groups and the LGBT community, and that those who attack video game criticism should [...] "put themselves in the shoes of people different from themselves".|$|E
500|$|However, in June 2011, users {{found that}} a trailer for Limbo {{appeared}} on the Steam software service, which video game publications such as PC Gamer took as a preliminary sign that a Microsoft Windows version would be released. Similarly, a possible PlayStation 3 version was projected based on the title appearing on the Korea Media Rating Board in June 2011. On 30 June 2011, Playdead announced their ports of the game to the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network, and to Microsoft Windows via Steam, later set for 19 July and 2 August 2011, respectively. Patti clarified that their change of mind from their earlier Xbox 360-exclusive approach was because [...] "we want as many people to play <b>our</b> <b>games</b> as possible". The release was set {{for nearly a year}} after the original availability of the Xbox 360 version, after the expiration of the Xbox 360 exclusivity rights for the game. Both the PlayStation 3 and Windows versions of the game have additional secret content, according to Patti; it is unknown if this content will be added in a patch to the Xbox 360 version. Playdead has since published a Mac OS X version of the game through the Mac App Store in December 2011, fulfilling their promise to release the title before the end of 2011; though they had wanted to also release the Mac Steam version by then, this version was ultimately delayed to mid January 2012. A Linux version of the game, based on a Wine-encapsulated package prepared by CodeWeavers, premiered in the Humble Indie Bundle V charitable sales event in May 2012. A native port for Linux was later released on 19 June 2014, with porter Ryan C. Gordon bringing over the Wwise audio middleware that previously prevented a native port from being possible. The PlayStation Vita version of the game was developed by Playdead with assistance from the UK studio Double Eleven, and was released in June 2013. The Vita version does not use the handheld's touchpad features; Patti stated that they [...] "didn't feel it would suit Limbo at all" [...] and wanted to provide the [...] "original experience" [...] of the game to Vita players. The Vita version has Cross-play support with the PlayStation 3 version, allowing the user to buy the game once to play on either platform. The iOS version of the game was announced shortly before its release in July 2013, and was designed to optimize the game for use on the touchscreen devices.|$|E

2500|$|Hudson did, however, {{note that}} there were some {{challenges}} during development. One of the difficulties was in deciding how much graphical detail to provide. [...] "Since <b>our</b> <b>games</b> generally have a lot of AI and scripting, numerous character models, and huge environments, we stress the hardware in a very different way than most games," [...] Hudson said. This made it difficult to predict how well the game would run. The game uses the Odyssey Engine, based on the Aurora Engine (previously developed by BioWare for use in Neverwinter Nights) but completely rewritten for Knights of the Old Republic. It was highly detailed for its time: grass waves in the wind, dust blows across Tatooine and puffs of sand rise as the player walks across the seabed.|$|E

Both suits assert Valve aiding in underaged gambling. Valve subsequently stated it has no commercial ties with these sites, {{and that it would}} demand these sites cease their use of the Steamworks API as they violate the authorized use policies. In October 2016, the Washington State Gambling Commission required Valve to stop the use of virtual skins for gambling on Steam, stating they would face legal repercussions if they failed to cooperate. Valve sent a letter on October 17, 2016 to the Washington State Gambling Commission stating, [...] "Valve has no business relationship with such gambling sites, and indeed they can come into existence, operate, and go out of existence without Valve's knowledge" [...] and that [...] "We are not aware of any such law that Steam or <b>our</b> <b>games</b> are violating".|$|E

[...] "We have guys in the studio who have spent countless hours and pockets full of money at arcades playing pinball." [...] Kigyossy explained that the design process for the tables begins with a conceptual design on paper. [...] Basic 3D models and shapes are then created and implemented into a test environment. [...] The artists then add graphical details and animations. [...] Once gameplay and visual design is complete a final pass is made [...] "properly lighting the table, so the tables becomes lifelike." [...] Simultaneously other designers work on the LED display system, sound and gameplay mechanics. [...] The game then spends {{two to three months}} in testing before the table is considered ready for release. [...] The entire process takes approximately six months per table. [...] Kigyossy further stated the team plans to [...] "keep the tables coming, support <b>our</b> <b>games</b> long term, and give fans a great selection to choose from." ...|$|E
