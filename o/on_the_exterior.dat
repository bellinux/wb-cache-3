Sculptor Leo Friedlander used Vermont marble {{for the large}} relief sculptures {{on both sides of}} the main entrance. One sculpture depicts Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, and Sacagawea, with a map of their expedition's route on the reverse (Lewis and Clark); the other (Covered Wagon) shows pioneers and a covered wagon, with a map of the Oregon Trail on the reverse.

5|$|Edward Somerset made minor {{improvements}} to {{the interior of the}} castle {{at the start of the}} 17th century, but focused primarily <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>exterior,</b> expanding and developing the gardens and building the moat walk around the Great Tower. The resulting gardens were considered the equal of any other others in the kingdom at the time.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>exterior,</b> the two {{and three}} lower stories in the {{respective}} buildings were of red sandstone, while {{the balance of the}} work to the roof-line was red brick and red terracotta.

5|$|Plans {{called for}} a four-story {{structure}} covered with zinc panels <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>exterior</b> {{with a total of}} , including a three story tall atrium. Plans for zinc <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>exterior</b> were later changed to stainless steel due to costs. Designed by Mayne and the DLR Group, the building was to be built using concrete and steel with a goal of earning Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification for sustainability, with large amounts of natural lighting designed to help secure that distinction. On the outside many security measures were incorporated into the design. The building was to include six courtrooms, administrative offices, and space for the offices of the U.S. Marshals Service. Despite security concerns as a federal building, the architect and judge Michael Robert Hogan sought to have an open feel to the structure. Hogan, the chief judge of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, was the primary government official tasked with working with the architect to design the courthouse.|$|E

The house included castle features such as a moat, drawbridge and turret and attracted paying tourists immediately following its completion.|$|E

These steps {{can also be seen}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>exterior</b> of an Eloi public building in MGM's 1960 version of The Time Machine. John Brahm was nominated for a Directors Guild award for his work on the episode. The book that Bemis was reading in the vault and that flips open when the bomb explodes is A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus by Washington Irving.|$|E
5|$|Later, Millennium Group {{offender}} profilers Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) {{investigate the}} disappearance of a bus full of schoolchildren. They believe the driver was also a victim, and not responsible; they meet with the local sheriff, John Cayce (Steven Rankin), who has dredged the bus from a lake. It is empty, but inside, Black experiences the same vision as Prine. He also finds paint transfer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>exterior,</b> indicating the perpetrator was driving a white van. A false positive results as police apprehend storm chasers in a different van, who warn that a violent tornado is approaching.|$|E

5|$|Raymond {{sought to}} {{mitigate}} {{the effects of the}} Pondicherry climate and oriented the Golconde dormitory (as it became known), so that its main facades faced north and south {{to make use of the}} prevailing breeze. A combination of moveable louvres <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>exterior</b> skin and woven teak sliding doors permitted ventilation without compromising on privacy. The building is still in use as an ashram today. It was the first modernist building in India.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s saw {{additional}} renovations. The auditor's {{office and}} the mayor’s office were both renovated, though work on the mayor's office halted when funds were exhausted. The city expanded {{the office of the}} city's attorney, and in 1982 the Portland Building was finished across the street. This allowed the city to move many city offices into a single location. Work was also completed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>exterior,</b> while a new roof was finished. In 1985, the building began a conversion from steam heating.|$|E

5|$|The Woodstock Neighborhood Association (WNA) {{originally}} {{made plans}} for a mural <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>exterior</b> wall of Lutz Tavern. Following an outreach effort to identify an artist, Lawrence and WNA met for a brainstorming session, during which they agreed on theme's for the proposed public artwork. Even after some funding was secured, efforts stalled. The association later proposed a mural for the nearby Red Fox Vintage building.|$|E

It was designed as essentially an ornamental building, with little defensive value.|$|E
