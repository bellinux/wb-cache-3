5|$|Joseph Meegar (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), a shy {{delivery}} boy {{who lives}} with his mother (Marylouise Burke), arrives late for work and delivers a package to an office building where he comes across Bethany (Diane Davis), a receptionist with whom he's infatuated. Afterward, while in an elevator, Bethany notices Meegar has pictures of her <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cell</b> phone. Meegar's angst then apparently causes the elevator to fall to the underground parking lot levels, killing all but Meegar. He is able to walk away unharmed, but is then startled as all the car alarms go off around him.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Hayes and Komisarjevsky {{escalated}} the aggravated {{nature of}} their crimes: Komisarjevsky sexually assaulted the 11-year-old Michaela. Komisarjevsky, who had photographed the sexual assault of the girl <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cell</b> phone, then provoked Hayes into raping Jennifer. While Hayes was raping her {{on the floor of}} the living room, Komisarjevsky entered the room and announced that William Petit had escaped. Hayes then strangled Jennifer, doused her lifeless body and parts of the house, including the daughters' rooms, with gasoline. While tied to their beds, both daughters had been doused with gasoline; each had her head covered with a pillowcase. A fire was started, and Hayes and Komisarjevsky fled the scene. Hayley and Michaela both died of smoke inhalation.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Paine, {{considered}} too moderate {{by the powerful}} Jacobin wing of the French revolutionaries, was imprisoned for ten months in France. He only escaped the guillotine by accident: the sign marking him out for execution was improperly placed <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cell</b> door. When James Monroe, {{at that time the}} new American Minister to France, secured his release in 1794, Paine immediately began work on Part II of The Age of Reason, despite his poor health. Part II was first published in a pirated edition by H.D. Symonds in London in October 1795. In 1796 Daniel Isaac Eaton published Parts I and II, and sold them at a cost of one shilling and six pence. (Eaton was later forced to flee to America after being convicted of seditious libel for publishing other radical works.) Paine himself financed the shipping of 15,000 copies of his work to America. Later, Francis Place and Thomas Williams collaborated on an edition which sold about 2,000 copies. Williams also produced his own edition, but the British government indicted him and confiscated the pamphlets.|$|E

50|$|In the letter, Norman {{explains}} his collaborations with various scientists {{to determine how}} to build a chamber which will shield him from cosmic rays and a coma-inducing drug. Norman constructs an underground chamber with six-foot leaden walls impervious to the outside radiation’s influence <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cells.</b> Once in the chamber, Norman will use the sleep-drug to fall into a coma where he “shall not awake until is again subjected to radiation,” which will be provided by an X-ray lamp (similar to what one finds next to any dentist's chair) set to power on after five thousand years. In hopes of awaking to a Utopian future, Norman encourages Vincent to live his life in the absence of his father.|$|R

5|$|Spotnitz {{found that}} the main problem with {{developing}} the episode was segueing from a movie that some—but not necessarily all—viewers had seen. The writers sought to bring back characters like Gibson Praise, Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender who {{were not in the}} movie. In addition, the writers also wanted to bring back elements that were also seen in the movie, like the alien. Carter claims to have been thinking about what the episode would entail almost two years prior, when he was working on developing The X-Files movie. The character Sandy, who is killed in the teaser sequence, was played by the show's casting director Rick Millikan on the request of Carter. Millikan later joked that he spent most of the shoot <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cell</b> phone casting other individuals for other X-Files episodes. One of the nuclear power plant workers is named Homer, a reference to Homer Simpson, one of the main characters from the animated Fox television series The Simpsons.|$|E

50|$|Bowser confronts Fawful in the {{transformed}} Peach's {{castle and}} defeats Midbus. The Dark Star's seal finally breaks, and Fawful tries to absorb its power, only for Bowser to punch him away. The Dark Star then enters Bowser's body, where {{it begins to}} leech <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cells</b> and absorb <b>his</b> DNA. Despite the Mario Bros. efforts to stop it, the Dark Star escapes and searches for Fawful to reclaim the power stolen from it, only for Bowser to find and defeat Fawful first. The Dark Star absorbs Fawful's remains and, using Bowser's DNA, becomes a shadowy, powerful doppelgänger of Bowser, named Dark Bowser. Bowser battles Dark Bowser and, {{with the help of}} Mario and Luigi, destroys the Dark Star. Fawful, having been inhaled by Bowser during the battle, initially feigns remorse but suddenly self-destructs in a final effort to destroy the Mario Bros. The explosion causes Bowser to regurgitate everyone he had inhaled. Enraged by the discovery, Bowser proceeds to fight the Mario Bros. but is defeated and retreats back to his castle. The two castles are rebuilt, and Peach sends Bowser a cake as gratitude for his unintentionally heroic efforts.|$|R

Scully attacks him in an ensuing confrontation, incapacitating him, while Skinner breaks up the medical procedure before the young woman is beheaded. Later, Mulder is at home when Scully tells him Father Joe has died. It happened at the same moment, Mulder notes, that Scully disconnected the life support to Tomczeszyn's severed head. Somehow, he surmises, the two men's fates were linked by more than just visions.|$|E
25|$|Standing {{in a large}} atrium, Roberts {{first opened}} fire at the mall's food court that was across from him at his left. The first to be shot was 54-year-old shopper Cindy Ann Yuille, a hospice nurse {{and mother of two}} who was shot in the back; she died despite efforts of {{bystanders}} to treat her wound. 15-year-old Kristina Shevchenko, who was walking through the mall with her friend to reach the Town Center MAX station, was the second person to be shot; she received a bullet to the chest, but she survived and made it out of the mall, where she was treated for her gunshot wound. The final victim was 46-year-old father of two and youth sports coach Steven Forsyth, who was sitting by a rented kiosk and talking with his father <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cell</b> phone when he {{was shot in the head}} and killed.|$|E
25|$|A {{road rage}} {{incident}} {{on the side}} of the highway led to the death of Richard Aderson in 1997. Aderson, an assistant superintendent at the Valley Central School District in Montgomery, was returning to his LaGrange home on the evening of February5, 1997, when he had a minor collision with a relatively new green Jeep Cherokee carrying what appeared to be New Hampshire license plates just before crossing the NewburghBeacon Bridge. The two drivers pulled over near exit12, and after a brief argument the other driver shot Aderson and left the scene. Aderson was able to give the 9-1-1 operator he called <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cell</b> phone a description of his assailant and the vehicle before dying at the scene. A police sketch based on Aderson's description has been widely circulated and is still posted prominently in kiosks at the freeway's rest areas. The case has been dramatized on both America's Most Wanted and Unsolved Mysteries, generating many leads since then but remains open.|$|E
50|$|Researchers first {{discovered}} chimerism {{in the bone}} marrow of marmosets in the 1960s. More recent work has shown that chimerism can occur in all cell lines, including germ cells. This allows {{for the possibility of}} horizontal inheritance. In other words, individuals could pass on the genotype that is different from their majority (or self) genotype. Consider a father marmoset was chimeric in his germ line. This father could potentially pass <b>on</b> <b>his</b> secondary <b>cell</b> line (the majority or self <b>cell</b> line of <b>his</b> brother) to his offspring. In this way, this father's offspring would be more genetically similar to their uncle than to their father.|$|R

50|$|In April 1943, Robert Moog {{infiltrated}} {{the group}} and turned several of its members over to the German authorities. Among them was Edmee Deletraz, who was then observed by the Gestapo. She was later suspected of having betrayed Jean Moulin, {{one of the best-known}} members of the French Resistance, but Devigny always defended her vehemently against this charge. After Devigny met her, he was arrested and sent to the formidable Montluc prison, which was considered escape-proof. There he was tortured by Klaus Barbie and his men, but he gave them no valuable information. He did, however, make an unsuccessful series of attempts to escape, and was punished after each one. He was sentenced to death on 20 August 1943, the execution to be carried out on 28 August. However, Devigny had discovered a way to remove his handcuffs with a safety pin. He ground the end of a spoon to a point <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cell's</b> concrete floor and used it to remove the wooden slats {{near the bottom of the}} cell door and squeeze through the opening. At night, he was able to leave the cell and speak with other prisoners. On the night of 24-25 August, when conditions for escape were optimal, Devigny and another prisoner who had recently been placed in <b>his</b> <b>cell</b> climbed out a skylight, using a rope made from a blanket and a mattress cover and a grappling hook fashioned from the frame of an old lantern, made their way across a roof and descended to the courtyard. Devigny threw a sentry to the ground and stabbed him with his own bayonet. The two inmates climbed an inner perimeter wall and, after a guard patrolling the perimeter corridor on bicycle had passed by, flung the end of the rope with the grappling hook across a 15-ft gap to the outer wall. They swung across the gap on the rope and leapt to the ground, gaining the freedom of the streets. Eluding German search parties, Devigny fled to Switzerland with the help of comrades in the Resistance.|$|R

Hours later he makes it back to the Jeep, but his leg is injured. Wes decides to climb a tall hill on the other side of the clearing to see if he can get a signal <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cell</b> phone. It does not work and the Bear nearly catches him. He quickly climbs back down and gets back to the Jeep though it still will not start. He and Lauren hide in the Jeep with the wounded Sean in the back.|$|E
500|$|The Russian {{characters}} {{from the start}} of the episode came from a [...] "great" [...] Russian acting community in Vancouver, British Columbia who had defected from the Soviet Union. Both Lea and Laurie Holden were required to learn Russian for the first scene following the opening credits. Alex Shostak Jr., who portrayed Dmitri, worked 12–14 hours a day; make-up was applied to give the appearance that his eyes and mouth had been sewed up, and a small straw was pushed between his lips to give him water. During the filming of the episode, he was [...] "literally" [...] blind and guided by the crew members throughout the filming of his scenes. Shostak provided the translation for his own lines from English to Russian. Holden and Lea worked diligently together to perfect their lines in Russian. Holden explained, [...] "we'd come up with these fun ways to test ourselves to know if we had really nailed it. Show tunes come to mind, but I also remember this one time my dialect coach had me call a Russian friend of his <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cell</b> phone to see if he could understand me.

500|$|Late at night, while {{investigating}} an orchard, Mulder is sprayed by a crop-dusting {{helicopter and}} {{ends up in the}} hospital. There, Mulder sees the message [...] "Do It Now" [...] on a TV and realizes that when people are exposed to the pesticide, which contains a chemical called LSDM designed to provoke fear in insects, they see these subliminal messages, and their phobias are exacerbated enough to cause them to kill. Eventually, after being confronted, the city councilman agrees to stop the spraying and blood test the community under the guise of a cholesterol study. Mulder and Scully, reading that Funsch has not been tested yet, arrive at his house to find it strewn with smashed electronic devices. Mulder deduces that blood is Ed's phobia and that he has seen the subliminal messages, and an empty rifle case signals that Funsch is going to act on his paranoia. Funsch positions himself {{at the top of a}} clock tower overlooking a blood drive and begins shooting randomly. Mulder climbs up to Funsch and overpowers him; Funsch is taken away on a stretcher. Mulder makes a call to Scully and sees the message [...] "All done. Bye Bye" [...] <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cell</b> phone display. Scully calls out to Mulder but he is speechless.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} an aerial shot of Las Vegas, Nevada, showing the Palms Casino Resort and {{continues}} with a shot of a marquee hotel that reads [...] "Britney Spears Live From Miami The Onyx Hotel Tour Las Vegas", {{with a picture of}} Spears holding a leather strap and referencing her Showtime concert special from Miami. Christian author Eva Marie Everson compared the image to [...] "Madonna doing her own impersonation of Marilyn Monroe." [...] Spears and her boyfriend (played by Stephen Dorff) are arriving to the hotel inside a limousine. They sit apart from each other, staring out separate windows. Spears wears a Birmingham Barons cap in these scenes. The boyfriend is talking <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cell</b> phone, and when she attempts to touch him, he pushes her away. The entrance is full of fans and paparazzi taking pictures. When they leave the car, fans and paparazzi alike act in an extreme way and fights break in the crowd. While her bodyguards try to protect her, her boyfriend throws magazines at the paparazzi. Stephanie Zacharek of The New York Times compared the shots of the paparazzi with the Jews in the 2004 film The Passion of the Christ. During this scene, she gets hit {{in the head with a}} camera, and unknowingly gets a wound on her head, but keeps walking.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of the show, Darryl Philbin reads from the program that {{contrary}} to Andy's assumption, the actor (Robert Mammana) playing Sweeney Todd has no acting or singing experience, and was discovered by the director while singing karaoke. Put out by this, Michael steals a bottle of wine from the concessions table, which he and his co-workers drink during the show. Andy, upset that Erin is not in the audience, repeatedly checks for messages from her <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cell</b> phone. While he is on stage, his phone rings in his pocket, disrupting the musical and forcing the performers to improvise. To make matters worse, Michael drops his bottle of wine, causing a commotion as it rolls. Then he loses grip of balloons he brought to his seat, which pop as they hit the top of the hall. This startles a baby, and the sound of her cries alerts Jim and Pam to the fact that Erin came to the play with CeCe, exciting Andy, but angering Jim and Pam. At the end of the show, everyone cheers except for Michael, who angrily boos the actor playing Sweeney Todd. During the party for the performers afterwards, the director compliments Michael on the [...] "energy" [...] of his audition and encourages him to audition again, suggesting that he felt that Sweeney Todd simply wasn't the right production for Michael's acting style.|$|E

40|$|The blood {{specimen}} of a 42 -year-old male donor was targeted for detailed {{study at the}} Iranian National Blood Transfusion Services as the ABO blood grouping of <b>his</b> <b>cells</b> and serum did not match. Preliminary results suggested that his group was “Bombay ” (Oh) phenotype. For confirmation, his blood specimen was air-shipped to Bombay, where detailed studies revealed the presence of depressed A antigens <b>on</b> <b>his</b> red <b>cells</b> that were detectable with variable strength with anti-A+B reagents prepared from group O individuals. <b>His</b> red <b>cells</b> failed to show agglutination by anti-H reagents from “Bombay ” phenotype, lectin from Ulex europaeus, and immunized chicken. The donor’s serum agglutinated group B red cells showing a titer of up to 1 : 32 at room temperature, but reacted with A and O red cells only at 4 ˚C in a low titer of 1 : 4 – 8. The reactivity against group A and O cells was partially inhibited by saliva from individuals secreting A/H antigens and was characterized as anti-I. The donor was classified as para-Bombay of AHw phenotype. The anti-I antigen strength on the donor’s red cells, as determined by titration of anti-I and anti-i reagents, was comparable to normal adult individuals {{but not to the}} “Bombay” phenotype, thus supporting his phenotype as para-Bombay. This case provides another example of the para-Bombay phenotype that serologically differs from the one reported earlier in Iran...|$|R
