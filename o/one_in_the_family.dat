No one saw {{the inside of her}} mind--probably, she did not herself. On the outside was a very {{suitable}} pensiveness, and affection for all that she was leaving. The only <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> to whom she talked much was Norman, who continued to see many perfections in George, and contrived, by the force of his belief, to impress the same on the others, and to make them think his great talent for silence such a proof of his discretion, that they were not staggered, even by his shy blundering exclamation that his wedding would be a great nuisance--a phrase which, as Dr. May observed, was, to him, what Est-il-possible was to his namesake of Denmark.|$|E

Millie and Margaret Leith were very nice girls, and the boys were nice, too. Indeed, we liked every <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> except poor old Miss Emily Leith. We tried hard enough to like her, because she seemed to like Diana and me very much, and always wanted to sit with us and talk to us, when we would much rather have been somewhere else. We often felt a good deal of impatience at these times, but I am very glad to think now that we never showed it.|$|E

60|$|Richard and Flora {{agreed with}} her, admiring the spirit which made her, in her {{weakness}} and helplessness, bear the whole burden of family cares alone, and devote herself entirely to spare her father. He was, indeed, her first object, {{and she would}} have sacrificed anything to give him ease of mind; but, perhaps, she regarded him more as a charge of her own, than as, in very truth, the head of the family. She had the government in her hands, and had never been used to see him exercise it much in detail (she did not know how much her mother had referred to him in private), and had succeeded to her authority at a time when his health and spirits were in such a state as to make it doubly needful to spare him. It was no wonder that she sometimes carried her consideration beyond what was strictly right, and forgot that he was the real authority, more especially as his impulsive nature sometimes carried him away, and his sound judgment was not certain to come into play at the first moment, so that it required some moral courage to excite displeasure, so easy of manifestation; and of such courage there was, perhaps, a deficiency in her character. Nor had she yet detected her own satisfaction in being the first with every <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E
