5|$|Calthrop {{appeared}} at the Light Railway Inquiry for the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway on 3–4 August 1897 and spoke particularly on the proposed open level crossings {{and the use of}} transporter wagons.

However the Order was not made until 8 September 1899 and in early 1900 the proprietors reached agreement with the Cambrian Railways to build the line. Their engineer, Alfred J. Collins, took charge of the engineering requirements, with consequent conservative 4-wheel wagons and other provisions.|$|E
