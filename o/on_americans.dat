5|$|In late April, German {{infantry}} {{conducted a}} raid on positions of the 26th Division, {{one of the first}} attacks <b>on</b> <b>Americans</b> during the war. At 0400 on 20 April, German field artillery bombarded the 102nd Infantry's positions near Seicheprey before German stoßtruppen moved against the village. The artillery box barrage, continuing 36 hours, isolated American units. The Germans overwhelmed a machine gun company and two infantry companies of the 102nd and temporarily breached the trenches before elements of the division rallied and recaptured the village. The Germans withdrew before the division could counterattack but inflicted 634 casualties, including 80 killed, 424 wounded, and 130 captured, while losing over 600 men, including 150 killed of their own. Similar raids struck the 101st infantry at Flirey on 27 May, and the 103rd Infantry at Xivray-et-Marvoisin on 16 June, but were repulsed. The 26th Division was relieved by the 82nd Division on 28 June, moved by train to Meaux, and entered the line again northwest of Chateau Thierry, relieving the 2nd Division on 5 July.|$|E

Gregg Herken 2 ̆ 7 s The Winning Weapon {{purports to}} be a {{detailed}} {{examination of the}} impact of the atomic bomb on the post-war world, particularly <b>on</b> <b>American</b> foreign and defense policy. The author aims to show the effect of the bomb <b>on</b> <b>American</b> domestic politics, <b>on</b> <b>American</b> strategic thinking, and, perhaps above all, <b>on</b> <b>American</b> policy toward the Soviet Union after World War II. Herken begins his discussion in September, 1945.

25|$|The Métis would {{establish}} a whole economic system around the bison trade. Whole Métis families {{were involved in the}} production of robes, which was the driving force of the winter hunt.

25|$|To {{alleviate}} this fundamentally flawed {{state of}} affairs, Skidmore {{argued for the}} end of the right of inheritance and for the strict leveling of property among adults. His program was straightforward: all property in the United States should be divvied up and redistributed, in equal shares, to American citizens. From that point <b>on,</b> <b>Americans</b> would own their share as private property, and would relinquish it only when they died. Private inheritance would be abolished, and the wealth of the deceased would be pooled into a fund and reserved, in the future, for young people when they reached the age of 18. Upon reaching that age, all Americans would inherit a generous sum of money, understood as their birthright, to get them started in adult life.|$|E

The Federalists, who had opposed the war to the point of trading with the enemy and threatening secession, were devastated by the triumphant ending of the war. The remaining Indians east of the Mississippi were kept on reservations or moved via the Trail of Tears to reservations in what later became Oklahoma.|$|E

25|$|FATCA was the revenue-raising {{portion of}} the 2010 {{domestic}} jobs stimulus bill, the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment (HIRE) Act, and was enacted as Subtitle A (sections 501 through 541) of Title V of that law. FATCA is controversial because foreign banks {{have been forced to}} comply under threat of a 30% withholding penalty on all their U.S. transactions. The U.S. has yet to comply with FATCA itself, because as of 2017, it has not yet provided the promised reciprocity to its partner countries and it has failed to sign up to the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). FATCA has also been criticised for its impacts <b>on</b> <b>Americans</b> living overseas, and implicated in record-breaking numbers of U.S. citizenship renunciations throughout the 2010s. Bills to repeal FATCA have been introduced in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, citing its unconstitutionality, particularly its breach of 4th amendment rights, as well as its high implementation costs and lack of revenue generation. A hearing on the unintended consequences of FATCA was held by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on 26 April 2017.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before 10 a.m. on June 25, 1996, {{members of}} a {{terrorist}} group detonated a truck bomb outside building 131 (also known as Khobar Towers) of the King Abdul Aziz Air Base.

In the attack, 19 US military personnel and a Saudi local were killed and 372 were wounded, making this the most deadly terrorist attack <b>on</b> <b>Americans</b> abroad since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing.

25|$|Some {{individuals}} and media sources expressed {{concern over the}} Qatari involvement. Because Qatari Diar was involved, the project was required {{to adhere to the}} restrictions of Sharia, or Islamic law. This included a ban on collecting interest. Not only did Qatari Diar provide cash (not interest-bearing loans) for the project, banks were not initially permitted as tenants. There were concerns that the sale of alcohol, pork, or tobacco as well as businesses such as gambling, hotels, movie theaters, and nude entertainment would also be prohibited. The Hines-Archstone group said it had never intended to allow banks, gambling, or liquor stores, and although it was seeking a wine bar (or similar business) as a tenant the Qataris said their interpretation of Sharia permitted such an establishment. The Qataris also said restaurants would be able to serve liquor and pork, because the sale of such items was not a restaurant's primary business. Automated teller machines would also be permitted, and the agreement between Hines-Archstone and Qatari Diar did not bar a bank as a tenant in the future. Concern over the Qatari role in CityCenterDC was expressed by the conservative think tank Center for Security Policy and by Pamela Geller, author of the popular conservative blog Atlas Shrugs, both of whom believed that Islamic law was being imposed <b>on</b> <b>Americans</b> without their consent. Conservative concern over the project was also reported in the Washington City Paper.|$|E
