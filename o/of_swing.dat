5|$|The WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland was {{originally}} {{scheduled to open}} on May 8, 2011, one week after that of Kings Island. On May 24, 2011, after problems were discovered during testing, Canada's Wonderland announced on their Facebook page that it would {{open to the public}} later that day, but it was quickly closed again when further mechanical problems were discovered. From May 24 to mid-June 2011, the ride was intermittently closed because of a variety of problems, most of which have since been resolved. At the beginning of October 2011, the hydraulic dampers used on the Knott's Berry Farm model were added to reduce the amount <b>of</b> <b>swing</b> movement even more.|$|E

25|$|In {{country music}} Jimmie Rodgers, Moon Mullican, and Bob Wills {{combined}} elements <b>of</b> <b>swing</b> and blues {{to create a}} western swing. Mullican left the Cliff Bruner band to pursue solo career that included many songs that maintained a swing structure. Artists like Willie Nelson and Asleep at the Wheel have continued the swing elements of country music. Asleep at the Wheel has also recorded the Count Basie tunes One O'Clock Jump, Jumpin' at the Woodside, and Song of the Wanderer using a steel guitar as a stand-in for a horn section. Nat King Cole followed Sinatra into pop music, bringing with him a similar combination <b>of</b> <b>swing</b> and ballads. Like Mullican, he was important in bringing piano to the fore of popular music.|$|E

25|$|Firstly, a batsman needs {{good eye}} {{reflexes}} which {{are considered to}} be a key skill when facing swing bowling. Secondly a batsman often needs to anticipate beforehand what the ball will do and adjust accordingly to play swing bowling. This can be done by observing the bowler's grip and action (which may have a marked difference depending on which type of swinger is to be delivered), by observing the field set, which may depend on the types of deliveries expected (as a rule outswingers will have more slips assigned) or by means of prior knowledge of the bowler; many can bowl or are proficient in only one type <b>of</b> <b>swing.</b> Traditional methods include the batsmen playing the ball as late as possible, and not playing away from the body. Other effective measures for combating swing bowling include standing well outside the crease, thus giving the ball less time to swing; and guessing the direction <b>of</b> <b>swing</b> based on the seam position observed in the ball's flight.|$|E
25|$|Many casual players use {{a tennis}} ball wrapped in layers of some type of {{adhesive}} tape (often electrical tape), which makes the relatively soft tennis ball harder and smoother.

40|$|Abstract. The work is {{designed}} and {{made as a}} controlled system of rotational inverted pendulum. Small direct current machine is droved by Single chip microcomputer that it controls the angle <b>of</b> <b>swinging</b> <b>of</b> <b>swinging</b> rod when the rotating arm does reciprocating rotation motion. The MC 9 S 12 CXS 128 single-chip microcomputer is adopted as the master control chip of control system, the Angle <b>of</b> <b>swinging</b> rod {{is measured by the}} incremental encoder, power of the rotary arm controlled part provided by PM 35 S- 048 direct current machine and the motor drive module as a control system. It can realize measurement and control of the rotation angle of the rotating arm and the <b>swinging</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>swinging</b> rod precisely. The basic solution system. System of inverted pendulum is a complex, nonlinear, multivariable, strong coupling, natural unstable system. In the process of control, it can reflect many key issues of control effectively, such as stabilizability, robustness, follow-up and track, thus it is an ideal model for testing various control theories. The mechanical structure of system as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Mechanical structure drawing Theoretical analysis and calculation...|$|R
25|$|If these {{variations}} in the escapement's force cause changes in the pendulum's width <b>of</b> <b>swing</b> (amplitude), this will cause corresponding slight changes in the period, since (as discussed at top) a pendulum with a finite swing is not quite isochronous. Therefore, the goal of traditional escapement design is to apply the force with the proper profile, and at the correct point in the pendulum's cycle, so force variations {{have no effect on}} the pendulum's amplitude. This is called an isochronous escapement.|$|E
25|$|Written transcriptions of rhythms {{tend to be}} imprecise. Usually {{only the}} basic idea of the rhythm is {{transcribed}} but the real feeling that it carries can't be easily put down on paper. This {{is due to the}} nature of the West African music—the different types <b>of</b> <b>swing</b> (at least four of them) that are not easily expressible with western notation. For this reason the written material for advanced players is still scarce if not unavailable, while the general and informational literature are readily obtained.|$|E
25|$|Jonathan Haas {{is one of}} the few timpanists who markets {{himself as}} a soloist. Haas, who began his career as a solo timpanist in 1980, is notable for {{performing}} music from many genres including jazz, rock, and classical. He released an album with a rather unconventional jazz band called Johnny H. and the Prisoners <b>of</b> <b>Swing.</b> Glass's Concerto Fantasy, commissioned by Haas, put two soloists in front of the orchestra, an atypical placement for the instruments. Haas also commissioned Susman's Floating Falling for timpani and cello.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{representation}} <b>of</b> <b>Swinging</b> London in three examples of 1960 s British cinema: Blowup (Michelangelo Antonioni, 1966), Smashing Time (Desmond Davis, 1967) and Performance (Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg, 1970). It {{suggests that the}} films chronologically signify the evolution, commodification and dissolution <b>of</b> the <b>Swinging</b> London era. The thesis explores how the concept <b>of</b> <b>Swinging</b> London is both critiqued and perpetuated in each film {{through the use of}} visual tropes: the reconstruction of London as a cinematic space; the Pop photographer; the dolly; representations of music performance and fashion; the appropriation of signs and symbols associated with the visual culture <b>of</b> <b>Swinging</b> London. Using fashion, music performance, consumerism and cultural symbolism as visual narratives, each film also explores the construction of youth identity through the representation of manufactured and mediated images. Ultimately, these films reinforce Swinging London as a visual economy that circulates media images as commodities within a system of exchange. With this in view, the signs and symbols that comprise the visual culture <b>of</b> <b>Swinging</b> London are as central and significant to the cultural era as their material reality. While they attempt to destabilize prevailing representations of the era through the reproduction and exchange of such symbols, Blowup, Smashing Time, and Performance nevertheless contribute to the nostalgia for Swinging London in larger cultural memory...|$|R
