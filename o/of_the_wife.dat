5|$|Wilson married Edna Taggert, {{the older}} sister <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> {{of his best}} friend in Anniston, in a {{ceremony}} in her home in Pittsburgh. After a honeymoon in Miami, Florida, they settled in Baltimore. The couple eventually had two children: Teresa Jane, born in 1921, and Donald, born in 1923.|$|E
5|$|In late 1992 Takanohana {{announced}} his engagement to actress Rie Miyazawa, news which sparked a similar amount of coverage {{to the royal}} wedding held that year. However the engagement was broken off the following year, reportedly because Miyazawa was seen by Takanohana's parents and the Sumo Association as being unwilling to sacrifice her career to become a regular stable wife. The role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> of a head coach in looking after the stable's recruits and liaising with supporter's groups {{is regarded as a}} full-time job.|$|E
5|$|Sejanus {{was born}} in 20 BC at Volsinii, Etruria, into the family of Lucius Seius Strabo. The Seii were Romans of the equestrian class (or knights), the lower of the two upper social classes of the Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire. Sejanus' {{grandfather}} maintained relations with senatorial families through his marriage with Terentia, a sister <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> of Gaius Maecenas, {{who was one of}} Emperor Augustus' most powerful political allies.|$|E

They were also prohibited from marrying another man ever again. (33:53) The Qur'an indicates that <b>the</b> <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> Muhammad {{had to be}} role models in society (33:30-32). She was often looked up to by <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> Muhammad due to her intelligence and political knowledge. Umm Salama herself narrated 378 Hadith, among them being some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important. She was <b>the</b> last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> Muhammad to pass away.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{his fame}} and popularity, like many former {{servicemen}} contending with post-war economic hardship, Smith struggled financially – a predicament compounded by illness. As a consequence he pawned his medals for £20, only {{for them to}} be recovered by the Jewish Historical Society on the urging <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> of Chief Rabbi Joseph Hertz and ultimately reunited with Smith. Smith's varied occupations in post-war Britain included work as an actor with a theatre troupe. He emigrated to Australia in 1925 with his wife Elsie (née McKechnie), whom he had married at Camberwell Register Office. Marriage to Elsie produced two children (Olive and Maurice) and reputedly angered his parents despite the couple's later observance of Jewish religious tradition in a formal ceremony held at Central Synagogue, Hallam Street.|$|E
5|$|In 1368 the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty {{collapsed}} amid widespread internal revolt {{during the}} Red Turban Rebellion, whose Han Chinese leader {{would become the}} founding emperor of the Ming dynasty. A formal resumption of direct trade and contact with Europeans would not be seen until the 16th century, initiated by the Portuguese during the Age of Discovery. The first Portuguese explorer to land in southern China was Jorge Álvares, who in May 1513 arrived at Lintin Island in the Pearl River Delta to engage in trade. This was followed by Rafael Perestrello, a cousin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> of Christopher Columbus, who landed at Guangzhou in 1516 after a voyage from newly conquered Portuguese Malacca. Although the 1517 mission by Fernão Pires de Andrade ended in disaster and his imprisonment by Ming authorities, relations would be smoothed over by Leonel de Sousa, the first governor of the Portuguese trade colony at Macau, China, in the Luso-Chinese treaty of 1554. The writings of Gaspar da Cruz, Juan Gonzáles de Mendoza, and Antonio de Morga all impacted the Western view and understanding of China at the time, offering intricate details about its society and items of trade.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{the image}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> in {{advertising}} has reflected the general {{views of the}} appropriate roles of a wife, images of the husband also reflect the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find images of the husband as performing work outside {{of the home and}} taking care of the family finances. It has been noted that this role has been especially prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one is not likely to find an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in household chores, except when they are depicted as particularly bad at performing the housework. In addition, it has been noted that over time, the portrayal of husbands and wives in an intimate, romantic relationship has been on the rise.|$|E

5|$|On August 30, Arnold sent {{a letter}} {{accepting}} Clinton's terms and proposing a meeting to André through yet another intermediary: William Heron, {{a member of the}} Connecticut Assembly whom he thought he could trust. In an ironic twist, Heron went into New York unaware of the significance of the letter and offered his own services to the British as a spy. He then took the letter back to Connecticut, suspicious of Arnold's actions, where he delivered it {{to the head of the}} Connecticut militia. General Parsons laid it aside, seeing a letter written as a coded business discussion. Four days later, Arnold sent a ciphered letter with similar content into New York through the services <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> of a prisoner of war. Eventually, a meeting was set for September 11 near Dobb's Ferry. This meeting was thwarted when British gunboats in the river fired on his boat, not being informed of his impending arrival.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 2011 Itzhak and Meir Abergil, {{together}} with Sasson Barashy, Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa, were extradited to the US, arriving in Los Angeles on January 13, aboard an American government airplane. They {{were being held}} in the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, facing a 77-page, 32-count federal indictment that alleges murder, massive embezzlement, money laundering, racketeering and running a large Los Angeles-based Ecstasy ring. The trial was set for November 8, 2011 in the Los Angeles Federal District Court. If convicted, they may face life imprisonment, but not the death penalty, as US authorities have promised their Israeli counterparts that even if found guilty of murder, the five suspects would not be given the death penalty. Under {{the terms of the}} extradition agreement, they would likely serve their sentence in an Israeli prison. Shortly after the extradition, a threatening letter was found under the car <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> of the Prosecutor who was involved in the extradition.|$|E
5|$|The Abdullah {{case that}} had brought him to South Africa {{concluded}} in May 1894, and the Indian community organised a farewell party for Gandhi {{as he prepared to}} return to India. However, a new Natal government discriminatory proposal led to Gandhi extending his original period of stay in South Africa. He planned to assist Indians in opposing a bill to deny them the right to vote, a right then proposed to be an exclusive European right. He asked Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary, to reconsider his position on this bill. Though unable to halt the bill's passage, his campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. He helped found the Natal Indian Congress in 1894, and through this organisation, he moulded the Indian community of South Africa into a unified political force. In January 1897, when Gandhi landed in Durban, a mob of white settlers attacked him and he escaped only through the efforts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> of the police superintendent. However, he refused to press charges against any member of the mob.|$|E

5|$|The {{east and}} south chancel stained glass is in memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife,</b> son, and {{daughter}} of Hugh Wynne Jones, {{who died in the}} mid-19th century. He was the first priest to be vicar of the parish (1868–1888); his predecessors had been curates, a lower position. He is depicted as Simeon, who in Luke's Gospel receives Jesus and his family when they visit the Temple of Jerusalem after the birth of Jesus (an event celebrated as the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple). The north transept has a three-light window to the north depicting St Edern, by Franz Mayer & Co. There are also windows with two lights on the east and west sides of the transept, one of which has a window from 1951 by Celtic Studios.|$|E
5|$|The {{stained glass}} in the east window, dated 1856, was made by William Wailes. The glass in a south window in the chancel of 1909 was made by Morris & Co. The east window in the north aisle, dated 1920 is by Irene Dunlop. The stained glass window {{to the left of}} the pulpit was donated by the Greg family of Styal Mill. The stained {{glass in the}} window at the west end of the north aisle is to the memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> of Edward John Bell, rector from 1870 to 1907, and was made by Clayton and Bell in 1877. The tower holds a ring of six bells, hung for change ringing, five of which were cast in 1787 by Rudhall of Gloucester, and the sixth by Charles and George Mears at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1847. A seventh, unused, bell dates from 1686 and has been noted as being of {{historical}} importance by the Church Buildings Council of the Church of England. The parish registers begin in 1629, and the churchwardens' accounts in 1612.|$|E
5|$|In 1097, {{after the}} {{surrender}} of Nicaea to the Byzantines, Alexios named John as commander-in-chief of the Byzantine army in Anatolia, and tasked with recovering the Aegean littoral from the Turks. To avoid conflict and facilitate negotiations, he was given custody <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wife</b> of the sultan of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum Kilij Arslan I (r. 1092–1107) and the daughter of Tzachas, who had been captured at Nicaea. John gave command of the fleet to Kaspax, and marched against Smyrna. After a short siege, Tzachas agreed to surrender the city {{in exchange for his}} safe departure and guarantees of the inhabitants' safety. The megas doux readily accepted and took possession of the city, naming Kaspax as its governor. Even before Kaspax could assume his duties however, he was murdered by a Muslim, and the enraged sailors of the fleet massacred the people of the city. John Doukas was unable to restrain them, and restored order only after the massacre had run its course. He then left the experienced general Hyaleas behind as doux of the city along with the entire fleet to secure the city, and continued his campaign. From Smyrna, John marched south to Ephesus. There, he defeated the Turkish garrison after a long battle, and took 2,000 captives, who were resettled in the Aegean islands. Petzeas was installed as doux of Ephesus, and John with his army turned inland. He took the cities of Sardeis and Philadelphia, which he entrusted to Michael Kekaumenos, and reached Laodicea, which opened its gates to him. From there, he marched to the fortresses of Choma and Lampe, installing Eustathios Kamytzes as governor, and reached Polybotos, where most of the Turks who had survived at Ephesus had fled. Having caught them by surprise, Doukas's army defeated them and took much booty.|$|E
