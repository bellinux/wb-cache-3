5|$|State Route 55 (SR55) is an 18-mile (30-km) long northsouth {{highway in}} the U.S. state of California. The {{portion of the}} route built to freeway {{standards}} {{is known as the}} Costa Mesa Freeway (formerly the Newport Freeway). SR55 runs between Finley Avenue south of Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1) in Newport Beach and the Riverside Freeway (SR 91) in Anaheim to the north, intersecting other major <b>Orange</b> <b>County</b> freeways such as SR22, SR73, and Interstate 405 (I-405). The freeway passes through suburban <b>Orange</b> <b>County.</b>|$|E
5|$|The route was {{originally}} designated County Highway416 in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1930, {{it became the}} easternmost part of New York State Route210 (NY210), a state highway continuing westward into <b>Orange</b> <b>County.</b> In 1982, NY210 was truncated to end in Greenwood Lake, and its former routing east of NY17 was replaced by CR106 in Orange and Rockland counties. CR106 in <b>Orange</b> <b>County</b> was decommissioned on January 1, 2014, when maintenance {{was transferred to the}} Palisades Interstate Park Commission.|$|E

Between 1996 and 2002, the fifth lane in both directions was constructed between I-5 and SR91, funded with a sales tax of half a cent approved by Measure M. In April 2007, the <b>Orange</b> <b>County</b> Transportation Authority approved funds to study the feasibility of extending the Costa Mesa Freeway south to 17th Street via tunnels or flyover ramps. The segment of SR55 from Finley Street to the Newport Channel bridge was legally authorized to {{be turned over to}} the city of Newport Beach in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Below Prado Dam, the Santa Ana River crosses into <b>Orange</b> <b>County,</b> {{and cuts}} between the Santa Ana Mountains and Chino Hills via the narrow Santa Ana Canyon. The river roughly bisects the county as it flows {{southwest}} towards the ocean. In Anaheim, the entire {{flow of the}} river (except during wet seasons) is diverted into spreading grounds for groundwater recharge of the north <b>Orange</b> <b>County</b> aquifer, providing {{about half of the}} county's municipal water supply. Downstream of there, the river is mostly confined to a concrete channel, serving only for flood control and urban runoff drainage, and is usually dry or a small trickle. At Orange it receives Santiago Creek from the east before entering Santa Ana. After crossing under Interstate 5 it passes through the River View Golf Course, one of its few non-concreted sections within <b>Orange</b> <b>County,</b> and then becomes a concrete channel again through most of Santa Ana and Fountain Valley to a point below the 405 Freeway, where the river bed becomes natural (though the banks remain concrete). The mouth of the river is located in a small tidal lagoon between Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa, at the northern end of Santa Ana River County Beach.|$|E
