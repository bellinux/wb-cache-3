5|$|In {{biological}} classification humans are animals, a basic point {{which has been}} known for more than 2,000 years. The creationist J. Rendle-Short asserted in Creation magazine that if people are taught evolution they can be expected to behave like animals: since animals behave in all sorts <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways,</b> this is meaningless. In evolutionary terms, humans are able to acquire knowledge and change their behaviour to meet social standards, so humans behave in the manner of other humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic rules}} of {{probability}} amplitudes {{that will be}} used are that a) if an event can happen in a variety <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> then its probability amplitude is the sum of the probability amplitudes of the possible ways and b) if a process involves a number of independent sub-processes then its probability amplitude is the product of the component probability amplitudes.|$|E

Clips from fights in previous Rocky movies are used during the introductory teaser to introduce Balboa, while stock footage from actual Tarver fights, as well as footage from Dixon's previous fight (shown {{at the beginning of the}} film) are used as clips for Dixon's part of the teaser. The fight itself was shot in High Definition to further enhance the TV-style look of the fight.|$|E
5|$|Though UCSC {{has been}} known for its {{conservation}} efforts and environmentally minded students since it was founded, since 2000 enthusiasm for the UCSC sustainability movement has grown steadily among students and administrators alike. Students established the Student Environmental Center (SEC) in 2001, have held annual Earth Summits, and established a sustainability funding body, the Campus Sustainability Council. In 2004, the UC Policy on Sustainable Practices was released, stating that the University of California Office of the President was committed to minimizing its impact on the environment and reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy. This set the scene for huge breakthroughs in 2006, when a Committee on Sustainability and Stewardship (CSS) was established and a campus-wide Sustainability Assessment was completed. The following year, the pilot Sustainability Office was created to help institutionalize sustainability, coordinate communication and collaboration between the many entities already engaged in campus sustainability activities at UCSC, support policy implementation, and serve as a resource for the campus. Sustainability has become a major part of every aspect of the campus, and students, staff, and faculty campus-wide are working toward sustainability in a variety <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b>|$|E

25|$|Numerous children's toys, {{generally}} {{aimed at}} the teen or pre-teen age bracket, allow experimentation with regular polygons and polyhedra. For example, klikko provides sets of plastic triangles, squares, pentagons and hexagons that can be joined edge-to-edge in a large number <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> A child playing with such a toy could re-discover the Platonic solids (or the Archimedean solids), especially if given a little guidance from a knowledgeable adult.|$|E

This ability to quickly raise potentially large amounts of capital from the marketplace is a key reason many companies seek to go public.|$|E

This finding has been confirmed in a variety <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways,</b> and is the subject of current research. Standard surveillance (including monthly breast self-exams and mammography at the usual schedule for age) is recommended, unless additional tests are indicated because the individual has other risk factors (e.g., family history of breast cancer).|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have found}} that females tend to think more about their body shape and endorse thinner figures than men even into old age. When female {{undergraduates}} were exposed to depictions of thin women their body satisfaction decreased, but rose when exposed to larger models. In addition, many women engage in fat talk (speaking negatively about the weight-related size/shape of one's body), a behavior that {{has been associated with}} weight dissatisfaction, body surveillance, and body shame. In addition, women who overhear others using fat talk may also experience an increase in body dissatisfaction and guilt. As a result, women may experience concerns related to body image in a number <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> and from a variety of sources.|$|E

25|$|In 1389 {{a system}} of {{conscription}} {{was introduced in the}} Ottoman military. In times of need every town, quarter, and village should present a fully equipped conscript at the recruiting office. The new force of irregular infantrymen was called Azabs and it was used in a number <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> They supported the supplies to the front-line, they dug roads and built bridges. On rare occasions they were used as cannon fodder to slow down an enemy advance. A branch of the Azabs were the bashi-bazouk (başıbozuk). These were specialized in close combat and were sometimes mounted. They became notorious for being brutal and undisciplined and were recruited from homeless, vagrants and criminals.|$|E
25|$|One widely {{accepted}} theory about {{the transformation of}} autonomous communities to chiefdoms is that an individual, or group of individuals must have used some degree of coercion to begin controlling others in their community. Stronger factions may have used coercion to force weaker factions to submit to their desires, {{and in order to}} do this they may have obtained their strength through a number <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> First, canny choices of farming plots allowed an individual or group of individuals to systematically gain an upper hand in crop production. Second, good alliance-building tactics may have been performed to stave off attacks by competing factions. And, lastly, healthy offspring would have ensured that an individual's lineage was secure for long after they were gone, allowing strong hereditary associations to control the fate of the dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Law {{enforcement}} {{have used}} mobile phone {{evidence in a}} number <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> Evidence about the physical location of an individual {{at a given time}} can be obtained by triangulating the individual's cellphone between several cellphone towers. This triangulation technique can be used to show that an individual's cellphone was at a certain location at a certain time. The concerns over terrorism and terrorist use of technology prompted an inquiry by the British House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee into the use of evidence from mobile phone devices, prompting leading mobile telephone forensic specialists to identify forensic techniques available in this area. NIST have published guidelines and procedures for the preservation, acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting of digital information present on mobile phones can be found under the NIST Publication SP800-101.|$|E
