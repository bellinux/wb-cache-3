40|$|This study {{aimed to}} test {{probability}} density functions for {{the distribution of}} variables total height, transverse area and individual volume, considering three different <b>class</b> <b>intervals.</b> Data {{were obtained from the}} measurement of diameter (DBH) and total height and from estimation of the individual volume of 338 pine trees in a fragment of Mixed Ombrophylous Forest with an area of 15. 24 ha, which is located in Jardim Botânico campus of UFPR, Curitiba-PR. Ten functions were fitted, including commonly used models for diameter distribution as well as other recently developed models applied to forest science. Selection criteria included Kolmogorov-Smirnov adherence test, standard error of estimate in percentage and adjusted coefficient of determination. Three <b>class</b> <b>intervals</b> were used as obtained by Sturges, Dixon & Kronmal, and Velleman criteria. The Normal function for variable height, and the Weber function for distribution of transverse area and individual volume, provided the best fit, considering the three <b>class</b> <b>intervals</b> adopted.

40|$|Choropleth mapping {{plays an}} {{important}} role in exploratory spatial data analysis and many objectives have been suggested to guide choropleth map construction. Because these objectives often conflict, a choropleth map that is best for one objective may not be best for others. Choosing a set of choropleth <b>class</b> <b>intervals</b> is thus a multiobjective problem. This paper describes a software toolkit, called ChoroWare, that is designed to help cartographers identify a set of <b>class</b> <b>intervals</b> that is suitable for a specific application. The software uses a genetic algorithm to generate a set of nondominated solutions to the choropleth <b>class</b> <b>interval</b> problem and uses a visualization tool to interactively display members of this classification set. Using ChoroWare, cartographers can examine trade-offs between alternatives and find choropleth classifications that meet their objectives. 1...|$|R
40|$|In length based fish stock {{assessment}} using von Bertalanffy growth model, the estimates of growth parameters Lm and K play a key role. A widely used estimation method is the one given by Pauly and David, using lengthfrequency data.

Here, an attempt is made to study this feature through simulation by using length samples simulated for 12 months with input parameters of Sardinella longiceps. Simulated data were used to estimate growth parameters by grouping and estimating for different <b>class</b> <b>intervals</b> ranging from 5 to 25 mm and the results then compared with the actual inputs.

40|$|This {{book has}} eleven chapters. Chapter one {{describes}} {{all types of}} natural <b>class</b> of <b>intervals</b> and the arithmetic operations on them. Chapter two introduces the semigroup of natural <b>class</b> of <b>intervals</b> using R or Zn and study the properties associated with them. Chapter three studies the notion of rings constructed using the natural <b>class</b> of <b>intervals.</b> Matrix theory using the special <b>class</b> of <b>intervals</b> is analyzed in chapter four of this book. Chapter five deals with polynomials using interval coefficients. New types of rings of natural intervals are introduced and studied in chapter six. The notion of vector space using natural <b>class</b> of <b>intervals</b> is built in chapter seven. In chapter eight fuzzy natural <b>class</b> of <b>intervals</b> are introduced and algebraic structures on them is built and described. Algebraic structures using natural <b>class</b> of neutrosophic <b>intervals</b> are developed in chapter nine. Chapter ten suggests some possible applications. The final chapter proposes over 200 problems of which some are at research level and some difficult and others are simple. Comment: 170 pages; Published by The Educational Publisher Inc in 201...|$|R

50|$|Word classes may {{be either}} open or closed. An <b>open</b> <b>class</b> {{is one that}} {{commonly}} accepts the addition of new words, while a closed class is one to which new items are very rarely added. <b>Open</b> <b>classes</b> normally contain large numbers of words, while closed classes are much smaller. Typical <b>open</b> <b>classes</b> found in English and many other languages are nouns, verbs (excluding auxiliary verbs, if these are regarded as a separate class), adjectives, adverbs and interjections. Ideophones are often an <b>open</b> <b>class,</b> though less familiar to English speakers, and are often open to nonce words. Typical closed classes are prepositions (or postpositions), determiners, conjunctions, and pronouns.|$|R
