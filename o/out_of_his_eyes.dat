2500|$|Manager – Appeared in [...] "Upgrade Pt2". He is {{the demon}} manager of 'Pissy Werld'. He never speaks, but instead hisses, as wispy smoke comes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> All the other {{employees}} of Pissy Werld {{seem to be}} afraid of him, as they run away when he comes in.|$|E
2500|$|On May 30, 2017, Griffin {{posted a}} video of herself holding [...] "a mask styled {{to look like the}} severed, bloody head" [...] of U.S. President Donald Trump, which was posted on her Instagram and Twitter accounts. She wrote: [...] "I caption this 'there was blood coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> blood coming out of his…wherever," [...] {{referencing}} a past comment Trump had made about Megyn Kelly. The video was from a shoot with photographer Tyler Shields, who is known for producing [...] "shocking" [...] imagery.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 May, {{they heard}} that the Belgian army was surrendering. [...] General Réquin spoke to Mrs Spears and {{emphasised}} the serious of the military situation. She received telephone calls from Paris – her husband wanted {{her to come to}} Paris before he flew to London. [...] She resisted – how could she leave her unit at a time like this? [...] Spears was insistent but she was reluctant, as was Captain Gosset, who feared the road might be cut and that she would be unable to get back. [...] They heard that Dunkirk had been evacuated. [...] Then Spears rang again – this time ordering her to come to Paris. [...] She decided to make a dash to the capital and back. [...] They met at the British embassy. [...] With the French army collapsing on all fronts, Spears was exhausted. 'His eyes were bloodshot. [...] There were lines inches deep in his face. [...] I saw for one second what was going to happen. [...] The war leapt at me <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] I was terrified.' ...|$|E
60|$|Psmith's eyeglass dropped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> He {{replaced}} it, and gazed, astonished, at Billy.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Vane shifted {{sharply in}} his seat, {{dropping}} the eye-glass <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> in a momentary and not unmanly embarrassment.|$|R

60|$|Sir Daniel, {{brushing}} the blood <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> stared blinkingly upon his captive.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned a}} rapt face towards her. The fire seemed leaping <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Before Jukes had {{squeezed}} the salt water <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{all the stars}} had disappeared.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's quite true; he can't. He can't brush his hair, or tie his cravat, or settle his pantaloons, without misbehaving himself. He {{certainly}} can't look <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> without gross misbehaviour." ...|$|R
50|$|Keith {{also has}} a tattoo of Spock's head on a lawn chair, day dreaming about what he (Spock) would look like with a moustache. Spock has a tear coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> because he cannot grow a moustache.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, {{what does}} this mean?" [...] demanded {{the man who had}} spoken before. He was a burly individual, with a heavy black {{moustache}} and closecut beard. The look <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> was far from a pleasant one.|$|R
60|$|Her companion's {{face grew}} grave. The smile went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> leaving them dark and sorrowful.|$|E
60|$|The febrile gleam died <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> to be {{replaced}} by a look of infinite sadness.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{sank back}} into his chair. His look changed again. The vision died <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|At {{the tenth}} round Bill couldn't see <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>'is</b> <b>eyes,</b> and kept wasting 'is {{strength}} {{on the empty}} air, and once on the referee. Ginger watched 'is opportunity, and at last, with a terrific smash on the point o' Bill's jaw, knocked 'im down and then looked round for the landlord's knee.|$|R
60|$|The Honourable Hilary {{regarded}} his son for {{a moment}} fixedly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> little <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hopper drew {{something}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pocket, <b>eyed</b> Miss Crane, and bit off a corner.|$|R
60|$|Their joyful exclamations {{made the}} child rub the water <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and look at}} his friends questioningly.|$|E

60|$|The visitor's {{expression}} {{remained unchanged}} {{except for the}} faint surprise which shone <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> blue <b>eyes.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Xiahou Dun lost <b>his</b> left <b>eye</b> {{when he was}} a hit by a stray arrow {{during a}} battle against Lü Bu in the late 190s, and {{subsequently}} became known among the rank and file as [...] "Blind Xiahou". His image as a one-eyed warrior was popularised by the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, in which he yanked the arrow <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> and devoured <b>his</b> eyeball.|$|R
60|$|Little Jacob stemmed {{the course}} of two tears which he was {{squeezing}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and instantly subsided into a silent horror.|$|E
60|$|He stopped again, and the {{strained}} expression suddenly sank <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{while the}} girl flushed to the temples {{when they met}} her own.|$|E
60|$|His hand closed fast on my arm. Some lurking {{devil in}} him that I {{had never seen}} yet, leapt {{up and looked at}} me <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|His Lordship {{took the}} rebuke with an oath, and {{presently}} hobbled {{down the stairs}} of the great and silent house to the stable court, where two grooms were in waiting with the horse. He was an animal of amazing power, about sixteen hands, and dapple gray in colour. And it required no special knowledge {{to see that he}} had a devil inside him. It gleamed wickedly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
60|$|After {{waiting a}} little for the displeasure to clear {{away from my}} face, Tedham smiled as if in humorous appreciation, and I perceived, as nothing else could have shown me so well, {{that he was still}} the old Tedham. There was an offer of {{propitiation}} in this smile, too, and I did not like that, either; but I was touched when I saw a certain hope die <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> at the failure <b>of</b> <b>his</b> appeal to me.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{disfigured}} by {{an accident}} which befell him while hunting, when the Duke <b>of</b> Berry put <b>out</b> one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> [...] probably {{before he was}} twenty-five.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{feel much}} {{inclined}} {{to go after}} crawfish or red-snappers to-day, Matt, do you?" [...] asked Dan, brushing the curls <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> with his right hand.|$|E

60|$|Geoffrey's pulse beat faster, and {{the smile}} faded <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> as he noticed, {{for the moon}} was high, the trace of faintly {{heightened}} color in the speaker's face.|$|E
60|$|The seaman, marvelling greatly, withdrew, and the skipper, {{throwing}} {{himself on}} a locker, wiped a bit <b>of</b> grit <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> {{and sat down to}} wait for the mate. He was so long in coming that he waxed impatient, and ascending a step of the ladder again peeped on to the deck. The first object that met his gaze was the figure of the mate leaning {{against the side of the}} ship with a wary eye on the scuttle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Clebber beast!" [...] shouted Quashy, who {{had stood}} with his ten fingers expanded, his great mouth open, and his whole {{emotional}} soul glaring <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> monstrous <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Kotlyarevsky {{was found}} under the dead bodies. Fluid leaked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right <b>eye,</b> {{he had a}} {{fractured}} jaw, and a bullet in his upper leg, but remained alive.|$|R
