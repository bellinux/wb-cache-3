"I own I do not," [...] {{answered}} Julian; [...] "but I {{have seen}} him in a character so different from that he now wears, that I feel it my duty to warn you, how you entrust the charge <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>child</b> to one who can alternately play the profligate or the hypocrite, as it suits his own interest or humour." ...|$|E

But the breakup <b>of</b> <b>your</b> marriage can be even more stressful and painful for <b>your</b> <b>children.</b> You may stop being husband and wife, but you both always will remain parents <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>children.</b> You will celebrate their successes and support them during times <b>of</b> disap-pointment. If <b>your</b> <b>children</b> have children, you will be grandparents together. As difficult as it may be, you have to continue to be responsible parents at what may be a very challenging time. The Parent Education and Awareness Program was designed to help you gain a better understanding <b>of</b> what <b>your</b> <b>children</b> are experiencing and to give you the practical tools and guidelines that can help reduce the stress <b>of</b> <b>your</b> breakup on <b>your</b> <b>children.</b> By participating in the Program, you have taken an important step that we hope will help you assure the emotional and physical well-being <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>children.</b> This Handbook was prepared to summarize the material presented in the classes, so that you can keep it with you and refer to it whenever you wish.

For {{twenty years}} of your life you lived without your child, without a thought <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>child.</b> One day you read in the papers that she had married a rich man. You saw your hideous chance. You knew that to spare her the ignominy of {{learning}} that a woman like you was her mother, I would endure anything. You began your blackmailing, ...|$|E

Learn from her life, a living truth. Learn from the creature dearest to your heart, {{how bad the}} bad are born. See every bud and leaf plucked one by one from off the fairest stem, and know how bare and wretched it may be. Follow her! To desperation!’ ...|$|E

6000|$|... "O, I see," [...] said Mr. Gregg. [...] "Certainly not. On the {{marriage}} <b>of</b> both <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>children</b> a certain sum was paid down and accepted in full of legitim. You have surely not forgotten the circumstance, Mr. Loudon?" ...|$|R
6000|$|But what {{teachers}} {{do you give}} your girls, and what reverence do you show to the teachers you have chosen? Is a girl likely to think her own conduct, or her own intellect, of much importance, when you trust the entire formation of her character, moral and intellectual, to a person whom you let your servants treat with less respect than they do your housekeeper (as if the soul <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>child</b> were a less charge than jams and groceries), and whom you yourself think you confer an honour upon by letting her sometimes sit in the drawing- room in the evening? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{very hard}} for me to explain why I have ventured on writing now, and yet I can't think that I am doing wrong. I heard a few days ago (for I have a friend at Pisa who keeps me informed, by my own desire, of all the {{pleasant}} changes in your life)--I heard <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>child</b> being born; and I thought myself, after that, justified at last in writing to you. No letter from me, at such a time as this, can rob your child's mother of so much as a thought of yours that is due to her. Thus, at least, it seems to me. I wish so well to your child, that I cannot surely be doing wrong in writing these lines.|$|E
6000|$|... "It matters not, Signore; God had {{not made}} you the arbiter of her fate. In tempting her family by your greater riches, you crushed two hearts, and {{destroyed}} the hopes of your fellow-creatures. In her was sacrificed an angel, mild and pure as this fair creature who is now listening so breathlessly to my words; in him a fierce untamed spirit, that had only the greater need of management, since it was as likely to go wrong as right. Before your son was born, this unhappy rival, poor in hopes as in wealth, had become desperate; and the mother <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>child</b> sank a victim to her ceaseless regrets, at her own want of faith as much as for his follies." ...|$|E

60|$|Em.: I wouldn’t trust a {{child with}} any one who had a temper like hers. Oh, Dickie, {{why did you go}} and have such a large family? You always said you wanted me to be the mother <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>children.</b>|$|R
6000|$|When Grandmarina {{had drunk}} her love {{to the young}} couple, and Prince Certainpersonio had made a speech, and {{everybody}} had cried Hip hip hip hurrah!
