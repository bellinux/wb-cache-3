5|$|Prevention {{of malaria}} {{may be more}} {{cost-effective}} than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the initial costs required are {{out of reach of}} many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provinces—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> budget.|$|E
