40|$|The {{objective}} of this research were to study hydrophobicity and antibacterial activity <b>of</b> <b>polyester</b> fibers before and after modification by using silver nanoparticles as antibacterial agent and hexadecyltrimethoxysilane (HDTMS) as self cleaning agent. The research was conducted in stages, chemical preparation of silver nanoparticles, deposit of silver nanoparticles on <b>polyester</b> fiber, modification <b>of</b> <b>polyester</b> fiber through the addition HDTMS, and characterization. Modification <b>of</b> <b>polyester</b> fibers with silver nanoparticles and HDTMS was conducted through dipping method, followed by curing. Characterization was conducted by testing the contact angle and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 35218. Silver nanoparticles has been prepared by adding sodium citrate and polyvinylalcohol as stabilizer. The addition of silver nanoparticles decreased hydrophobicity <b>of</b> <b>polyester</b> fibers without and with modification. Modification with HDTMS increased hydrophobicity <b>of</b> <b>polyester</b> fibers. Modification with silver nanoparticles and HDTMS increased antibacterial activity <b>of</b> <b>polyester</b> fabrics.

40|$|Abstract. Effect of {{different}} gauge of pin carding plate and saw-tooth carding plate respectively installed under the licker-in of carding machine on polyester yarn hairiness was studied. The hairiness <b>of</b> <b>polyester</b> yarns {{produced in the}} condition of installing pin carding plate and saw-tooth carding plate under the licker-in at four different gauges were tested by YG 172 yarn hairiness tester.

When the pin carding plate gauge is 1. 0 mm and the saw-tooth carding plate gauge is 0. 3 mm, the number <b>of</b> <b>polyester</b> yarn hairiness is the most.

40|$|Abstract. The {{alkaline}} hydrolysis <b>of</b> <b>polyester</b> fabric in NaOH solution {{in the presence}} of several 1 -alkyl- 3 - methylimidazolium bromine ionic liquids (ILs), CnMImBr (n= 8, 12, 14, 16) was examined in comparison to the use of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as an accelerant. The weight loss <b>of</b> <b>polyester</b> fabric was found to be greatly dependent on the concentrations of ILs and the length of alkyl groups in ILs. C 14 MImBr and C 16 MImBr exhibited good catalytic actions. The use of C 16 MImBr as an accelerator could endow polyester fabrics with slightly higher weight loss in comparison with CTAB. In the presence of C 16 MImBr, the activation energy <b>of</b> <b>polyester</b> hydrolysis reaction was slightly higher than that for the use of C 14 MImBr as a catalyst. In summary, the CnMImBr with long carbon chain can be employed as the novel accelerator for the weight reduction process <b>of</b> <b>polyester</b> fabrics...|$|R
