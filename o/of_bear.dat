5|$|SH74, {{now known}} as Bear Creek Road, curves east- and northward as it winds out of town. Narrowing to two lanes, the route follows the path <b>of</b> <b>Bear</b> Creek, curving northeasterly toward Kittredge with Pence Park on the east side. In Kittredge, the route meets CR 120 (Myers Gulch Road), which heads {{southeast}} toward Indian Hills. The route again meets Kerr Gulch Road, which bypasses the large curve which SH74 took. From Kittredge, SH74 winds eastward {{on the north side}} <b>of</b> <b>Bear</b> Creek. The roadway passes Idledale north of the Lair O the Bear Park, where it intersects Grapevine Road. East of the town, an abandoned section of SH74 exists, which now serves as a path to private areas. The route heads into Bear Creek Canyon Park, where it curves along the creek in a more rocky terrain. SH74 also passes through Red Rocks Park along the stream. Exiting the park, SH74 enters Morrison, where Bear Creek Road meets SH8 at an intersection. From here, SH8 (Morrison Road) serves as the continuation of the road toward Denver.|$|E
5|$|On 13 July U-255 {{found the}} 7,168 ton Dutch {{merchant}} ship Paulus Potter abandoned and drifting, with 2,250 tons of general goods, ammunition, 34 tanks, 15 aircraft and 103 trucks aboard. The ship {{had been attacked}} by Ju 88 dive bombers of III./KG 30 east-north-east <b>of</b> <b>Bear</b> Island on 5 July, the day after Convoy PQ 17 dispersed. The crew had abandoned the badly damaged ship, believing {{it was about to}} sink. All 76 of the crew had taken five days to reach land at Novaya Zemlya, eventually being rescued by a Soviet whaling vessel. After finding her the II.WO and two mates from U-255 boarded the ship, and attempted to start the engines, but the engine room was flooded. They then searched the vessel, taking blankets, cigarettes, and other useful materials, including confidential documents found on the bridge, and the ship's ensign as a prize, before the ship was sunk with a single torpedo. U-255 returned to Narvik on 15 July.|$|E

5|$|Passing {{the park}} gate, M-203 {{continues}} northeasterly. The roadway skirts the northern shore <b>of</b> <b>Bear</b> Lake {{on the eastern}} end of the state park. At Lakeshore Drive, M-203 turns inland running due east to Cloverland Road then turning north and east along Veterans Memorial Highway. Along this section of roadway, the AADT was measured at 440vehicles in 2007. The highway follows Veterans Memorial Highway through the neighborhood of Tamarack west of Calumet. From there it continues eastward, following Pine Street north of downtown Calumet, looping back to US41/M-26. The northern terminus of M-203 is at the intersection of Pine Street and Calumet Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{continues}} on a northeasterly course running inland along Chippewa Highway {{to the community}} <b>of</b> <b>Bear</b> Lake. US31 rounds {{the east side of}} the community's namesake body of water on Lake Street and exits town on Pleasanton Highway. The trunkline continues northward and northeasterly through Pleasanton and crosses into Benzie County. Over the county line, it follows Benzie Highway northward to an intersection with M-115 (Cadillac Highway). The two merge and run north into Benzonia, following Michigan Avenue in town. Near the south shore of Crystal Lake, M-115 turns westward toward Frankfort and US31 follows Michigan Avenue into Beulah, running around the eastern end of the lake. Near the eastern end of Platte Lake, US31 turns to run easterly into Honor before crossing into Grand Traverse County.|$|E
5|$|The most {{widespread}} {{species is}} the brown bear, which occurs from Western Europe eastwards through Asia {{to the western}} areas of North America. The American black bear is restricted to North America, and the polar bear is restricted to the Arctic Sea. All the remaining species <b>of</b> <b>bear</b> are Asian. They occur {{in a range of}} habitats which include tropical lowland rainforest, both coniferous and broadleaf forests, prairies, steppes, montane grassland, alpine scree slopes, Arctic tundra {{and in the case of}} the polar bear, ice floes. Bears may dig their dens in hillsides or use caves, hollow logs and dense vegetation for shelter.|$|E
50|$|Investor Intelligence Sentiment Index: If the Bull-Bear spread (% of Bulls - % <b>of</b> <b>Bears)</b> {{is close}} to a {{historic}} low, it may signal a bottom. Typically, the number <b>of</b> <b>bears</b> surveyed would exceed the number of bulls. However, {{if the number of}} bulls is at an extreme high and the number <b>of</b> <b>bears</b> is at an extreme low, historically, a market top may have occurred or {{is close to}} occurring. This contrarian measure is more reliable for its coincidental timing at market lows than tops.|$|R
40|$|Human fear is {{important}} in wildlife management, but self-reported fear provides only partial information about fear reactions. Thus, eye movements, skin conductance, and changes in heart rate were assessed during picture viewing, visual search, and implicit evaluation tasks. Pictures <b>of</b> <b>bears,</b> wolves, moose, and hares were presented to participants who self-reported as fearful <b>of</b> <b>bears</b> (n = 8), fearful <b>of</b> <b>bears</b> and wolves (n = 15), or not fearful <b>of</b> <b>bears</b> or wolves (n = 14). The feared animal was expected to elicit strong physiological responses, be dwelled upon, and be associated with negative words. Independent <b>of</b> fearfulness, <b>bear</b> pictures elicited the strongest physiological responses, and wolf pictures showed the strongest negative associations. The bear-fearful group showed stronger physiological responses to bears. The bear- and wolf-fearful group showed more difficulty in associating bears with good words. Presence of a feared animal in the search task, resulted in prolonged response time...|$|R

5|$|In mid-May, Liverpool {{joined a}} group of {{warships}} that was to have escorted Trinidad on her return journey to Britain. After temporary repairs in Russia, Trinidad got underway on 13 May. The group that included Liverpool positioned itself west <b>of</b> <b>Bear</b> Island, in the Barents Sea, to rendezvous with the cruiser. On 14 May, Trinidad came under repeated attack and was set ablaze by bombs. The British had to evacuate and sink her the following day when the fire became uncontrollable. Liverpool {{and the rest of}} Rear-Admiral Burrough's group came under attack themselves on the return journey. On 25 May, Liverpool began escorting PQ 16, a convoy of 35 merchant vessels bound for Murmansk, the largest convoy yet undertaken in support of the Soviet Union. PQ 16 had considerable protection, including the light and heavy cruisers , Kent, and Norfolk, and numerous destroyers and submarines, with distant cover provided by the Home Fleet. Inevitably, the convoy came under attack, beginning with a sortie on 25 May that damaged the freighter SS Carlton. Sustained attacks from U-boats and at least 242 German aircraft yielded a total of seven vessels sunk on 26â€“27 May. The cruiser escort switched to the returning convoy QP 12 on 26 May.|$|E
5|$|The Great Salt Lake is fed {{by three}} major rivers and several minor streams. The three major rivers are each fed {{directly}} or indirectly from the Uinta Mountain range in northeastern Utah. The Bear River starts on the north slope of the Uintas and flows north past Bear Lake, into which some <b>of</b> <b>Bear</b> River's waters have been diverted via a man-made canal into the lake, but later empty back into the river {{by means of the}} Bear Lake Outlet. The river then turns south in southern Idaho and eventually flows into the northeast arm of the Great Salt Lake. The Weber River also starts on the north slope of the Uinta Mountains and flows into the east edge of the lake. The Jordan River does not receive its water directly from the Uintas, rather it flows from freshwater Utah Lake, which itself is fed primarily by the Provo River; the Provo River does originate in the Uintas, {{a few miles from the}} Weber and Bear. The Jordan flows from the north part of Utah Lake into the southeast corner of the Great Salt Lake.|$|E
5|$|US-89 {{meets the}} current {{alignment}} of US-91 {{in the southern}} outskirts of Brigham City, turning east for an overlap on the city's southeast bypass. (SR-13 and SR-90 are the former alignment through Brigham City.) The two routes head east up Box Elder Canyon in the southern Wellsville Mountains, finally leaving {{the valley of the}} Great Salt Lake into a small valley that contains Mantua Reservoir (elevation 5200 feet/1585 m). US-89/US-91 turns north there, bypassing the town of Mantua to the west, and continues to ascend through Dry Canyon to Sardine Summit (elevation 5900 feet/1798 m). Another small valley leads to Wellsville Canyon, where the four-lane roadway again turns east and descends into the Cache Valley. In that valley, US-89/US-91 heads northeast, bypassing Wellsville to the east, into downtown Logan. US-91 continues northerly from Logan into Idaho, but US-89 splits to the east, beginning a long climb of the Bear River Range through Logan Canyon. The Logan Canyon Scenic Byway, a Utah and National Scenic Byway, begins at Logan and follows US-89 up the canyon, past the access road to the Beaver Mountain ski area, to Garden City and on to the state line. Bear Lake Summit (elevation 7800ft/2377 m), {{at the top of the}} range, is the highest point on US-89 in Utah, from which it descends the east slope via horseshoe curves to Garden City on the shore <b>of</b> <b>Bear</b> Lake (elevation 5900ft/1798 m). The final segment of US-89 to the Idaho state line follows the lake's west shore, its location constrained by the Bear River Range just to the west.|$|E

5|$|US219 passes {{along the}} eastern edge of Mount Nebo Wildlife Management Area and crosses Hoop Pole Hill. North of Sand Flat Road, the highway passes Mayhew Inn Road, which leads west to Swallow Falls State Park. US 219 descends from Hoop Pole Ridge and reaches the southwestern shore of Deep Creek Lake in the hamlet of Thayerville. After passing Glendale Road, which heads east toward Deep Creek Lake State Park and other {{destinations}} {{on the east side of}} the lake, the highway turns northwest and parallels the west shore of the lake east of Roman Nose Hill. After passing Lakeshore Drive, US219 crosses the lake on the Deep Creek Bridge. The highway becomes a partially controlled access highway on the hillside above the lake, while Deep Creek Drive follows the shore. US219 continues north through the unincorporated village of McHenry. In McHenry, the highway intersects Mosser Road, which provides access to Garrett College and Garrett County Airport, and Sang Run Road, which leads to Wisp Ski Resort. After meeting the northern end of Deep Creek Drive, the highway leaves Deep Creek Lake and curves northeast at its junction with MD42 (Friendsville Road). US219 continues northeast along Rocklick Creek and the South Branch <b>of</b> <b>Bear</b> Creek. After leaving the South Branch, the highway follows Main Street through the town of Accident. Within the town, the highway intersects Accident Friendsville Road and Accident Bittinger Road, which heads east toward the James Drane House.|$|E
