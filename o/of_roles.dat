40|$|PublishedThe lack <b>of</b> senior female <b>role</b> models {{continues}} to be cited as a key barrier to women's career success. Yet there is little academic research into the gendered aspects <b>of</b> <b>role</b> modelling in organizations, or the utility <b>of</b> <b>role</b> models at a senior level. The paper starts with a review of papers examining the construction <b>of</b> <b>role</b> models in organizational settings. This leads to the inclusion of two related areas – organizational demographics as the contextual factor affecting the availability <b>of</b> <b>role</b> models {{and how they are}} perceived, and work identity formation as a possible key explanatory factor behind the link between the lack <b>of</b> senior female <b>role</b> models and the lack of career progression to top organizational levels. The literature looking at social theories of identity formation is then considered from a gender perspective. The key gaps identified are that while the behavioural value <b>of</b> <b>role</b> models has been well documented, a better understanding is needed of how gender and organizational demography influence the role modelling process. Importantly, the symbolic value and possibly other values <b>of</b> female <b>role</b> models in the identity construction of senior women require further in-depth investigation. Finally, this review calls for a more integrated approach to the study <b>of</b> <b>role</b> models and work identity formation, pulling together literatures on organizational demography, the cognitive construal <b>of</b> <b>role</b> models and their importance for successful work identity formation in senior women...|$|R

40|$|Discrepancy or {{difference}} measures <b>of</b> job-related <b>role</b> perceptions {{have long}} been employed as environmentally-based surrogate measures <b>of</b> occupational <b>role</b> stress (i. e., subjective role conflict and role ambiguity). The validity of these differences measures as alternate indices <b>of</b> <b>role</b> stess, however, has only been assumed. The present research attempted to address this deficiency. Employees (N = 297) of a large public service agency responded to questionnaires concerning role-related activities in their jobs as either caseworkers or clerks, and concerning job-related affective and behavioral states, such as job satisfaction, involvement, and performance. Four competing theoretical models which examined the relationships between discrepancy measures and the affective and behavioral measures were tested. These models were derived for current theoretical and empirical findings. The following conclusions {{can be drawn from}} the results of this research: (1) Discrepancy measures <b>of</b> <b>role</b> perceptions were not related to subjective measures <b>of</b> <b>role</b> stress. (2) Discrepancy scores played a relatively minor role in theory; most of their variability was determined by factors outside the models. (3) Subjective measures <b>of</b> <b>role</b> stress made a fairly substantial contribution to theory as a mediator between organizationally-relevant antecedent and outcome variables. (4) Some group differences were indicated which suggests that discrepancy measures <b>of</b> <b>role</b> perceptions may have been more valid in the clerical sample. Although the continued use of discrepancy measures as surrogates <b>of</b> <b>role</b> stress cannot be recommended, {{further research is needed to}} clarify possible occupational differences in the utility of discrepancy scores.
