50|$|<b>Orange</b> <b>cards</b> may be {{directly}} discarded. However, they cannot {{be directly}} stolen. When a player attempts to steal an <b>orange</b> <b>card,</b> the <b>orange</b> <b>cards</b> are brought into your hand, shuffled, {{and then a}} card is randomly stolen from your hand instead. Afterwards, place down your remaining <b>orange</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Orange</b> <b>cards</b> {{are placed}} {{face down in}} front of you {{whenever}} they are acquired. You may look at them whenever you wish, but they are not for the eyes of other players. When you use <b>orange</b> <b>cards</b> at the appropriate events, flip the card over and do as it specifies. There is a [...] "grace period" [...] when <b>orange</b> <b>cards</b> are played. As long as they are played in a timely manner, they count. If <b>orange</b> <b>cards</b> are laid quickly in succession of one another, treat them as simultaneous. Thus, if 1 <b>orange</b> <b>card</b> is contrary to another, they are nullified. However, if the <b>orange</b> <b>cards</b> are the same, temporality dictates the order and validity of the cards.|$|R

50|$|While the <b>orange</b> <b>cards</b> {{function}} in the above specified way {{at the beginning of}} the game, some of them change when the game reduces to 2 players or your team is eliminated. <b>Orange</b> <b>cards</b> that are designed to solely help teammates provide an option to function as different cards in these situations. Their optional function is specified in the bottom right hand corner of the card. They are placed face down like usual, but these optional functions can only be used on your turn. Altered play is activated for the following: for an Outlaw when he is the last of his team remaining; for a Sheriff when there are no Deputies or Renegades remaining; for Renegades, Sheriffs, and Outlaws when there are only 2 players remaining. Finally, the addition of <b>orange</b> <b>cards</b> also affects card limits. Every player is allowed 1 extra card to their limit, as long as that 1 <b>card</b> is <b>orange.</b> After this <b>card,</b> all <b>orange</b> <b>cards</b> contribute to your limit.|$|R

50|$|<b>Orange</b> <b>cards</b> {{can never}} be played on your turn. Instead, they are played at or during events on other players’ turns, as {{specified}} on each <b>orange</b> <b>card.</b> Most <b>orange</b> <b>cards</b> are designed to enhance teamplay (Deputies with the Sheriff, Outlaws amongst each other, and the Renegade with whatever group he chooses), as they only occasionally help you directly. They {{are also designed to}} speed up the game, and make you more involved in the game when it is not your turn. Thus, <b>orange</b> <b>cards</b> allow players to do actions like these: back up another player when he shoots at someone, push a player out of harm's way when he is shot at (or dive and take a hit for him), confiscate a card in play in front of a player for a round, give a card from your hand to another player, shoot at a player when he shoots at someone else, add/remove distance modifiers to another player for a round, taunt another player which forces him to shoot at you if he can, and so forth.|$|R

2500|$|In the 1885 UK general {{election}} the nationalist Irish Parliamentary Party held {{the balance of}} power in the House of Commons, and entered into an alliance with the Liberals. Its leader, Charles Stewart Parnell convinced William Gladstone to introduce the First Irish Home Rule Bill in 1886. Immediately, an Irish Unionist Party was founded and organised demonstrations in Belfast against the Bill, fearing that separation from Great Britain would bring industrial decline and religious persecution of Protestants by a Roman Catholic-dominated Irish government. English unionist politician Randolph Churchill proclaimed: [...] "the <b>Orange</b> <b>card</b> is the one to play", which was later expressed in the popular slogan, Home Rule means Rome Rule.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{attempts}} to measure spatial vision in infants have encountered serious drawbacks, {{such as the}} expense and sophistication of the equipment required, or the time necessary to complete the test. Adams, Mercer, Courage, and van Hof-van Duin (1992) have developed a prototype contrast sensitivity (CS) <b>card</b> <b>procedure</b> which sidesteps these problems, most notably test time. Despite its success, the prototype possesses several limitations which affect the accuracy and {{the efficiency of the}} procedure. [...] In the present thesis, custom software and printing techniques were developed to construct a new set of CS cards which, compared to the prototype, contain four improvements: (1) Larger, more salient test gratings; (2) higher contrast "warm-up" cards in each spatial frequency set; (3) smaller contrast step size between adjacent cards; (4 -) gratings mounted onto more durable backgrounds. The success of the new cards was evaluated by testing 3 - and 12 -month-old human infants and comparing the results to those obtained with the prototype cards. [...] Results indicate that the new CS cards were very successful. Compared to the prototype, which required 10 to 15 minutes, the new <b>card</b> <b>procedure</b> was completed by most subjects within 5 to 8 minutes. Also, compared to the prototype, individual contrast sensitivity functions (CSFs) of 12 -month-olds tested with the new cards are more typical of healthy infants as measured by more rigorous behavioral procedures. Surprisingly, however, group CSFs obtained with the new cards were lower than those obtained with the prototype, a discrepancy that may be due to differences in space average luminance between the two sets of cards. In all, the new CS <b>card</b> <b>procedure</b> possesses several merits which give it potential as a technique for widespread adoption by both researchers and clinicians. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{determine}} the impact on workload redistribution resulting from the use of government credit cards at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). Because workload requirements, particularly the Supply Department's, may have been redistributed across other departments at NPS, these will be identified and measured. Primary data on procurement cases was collected from the Comptroller's Department and the procurement branch of the Supply Department. Pre-credit <b>card</b> <b>procedures</b> (purchase orders, BPAs and the Imprest Fund) and related purchase action volume were identified and measured, as well as government credit <b>card</b> procurement <b>procedures</b> and related purchase action volume. The intent is to identify any workload requirements, such as technical screening, procurement and material receipt, which may have been redistributed as a result of using government credit cards.

40|$|Despite {{the wide}} {{usage of the}} Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT), it has two main problems: {{it is not so}} {{sensitive}} at low mental workload and it requires a <b>card</b> sorting <b>procedure</b> that is time consuming.

The <b>card</b> sorting <b>procedure</b> {{has been replaced by a}} pair-wise comparison procedure similar to that of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration - Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). In addition, a continuous scale is used instead of the discrete SWAT scale. This Continuous SWAT scale (C-SWAT) has been compared experimentally with the original SWAT scale using simple arithmetic tasks. Results show that the "new" procedure takes significantly less time than the original <b>card</b> sorting <b>procedure.</b> The results also seem to indicate that C-SWAT is sensitive at low mental workloads. At medium mental workloads, the SWAT and C-SWAT scales give similar results...|$|R

Yet FitzGibbon had always been noted for his political moderation: he had a wide circle of friends of differing political views, and his daughter Anne married a close relative of Gladstone. His house, Kilrock, on the Hill of Howth, was one of the centres of Dublin social life: here he entertained not only his legal colleagues, but many of the leading Irish and British politicians of the day.
