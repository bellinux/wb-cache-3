500|$|Pulmonary {{contusion}} or its complications such as {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome {{may cause}} lungs to lose compliance (stiffen), so higher pressures {{may be needed to}} give normal amounts of air and oxygenate the blood adequately. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), which delivers air at a given pressure {{at the end of the}} expiratory cycle, can reduce edema and keep alveoli from collapsing. [...] PEEP is considered necessary with mechanical ventilation; however, if the pressure is too great it can expand the size of the contusion and injure the lung. When the compliance of the injured lung differs significantly from that of the uninjured one, the lungs can be ventilated independently with two ventilators in order to deliver air at different pressures; this helps avoid injury from <b>overinflation</b> while providing adequate ventilation.|$|E

50|$|In {{a patient}} with acute lung injury (ALI), the right level of PEEP is that which optimizes {{arterial}} oxygenation without causing O2 toxicity or ventilatior-induced lung injury. Balancing the benefit of keeping the lung open (during tidal ventilation) against the risk of lung <b>overinflation</b> may require monitoring of the pressure-volume curve, lung morphology, and gas exchange. When loss of aeration has a focal distribution (atelectatic lower lobes coexisting with aerated upper lobes), {{a high level of}} PEEP can cause <b>overinflation</b> of already aerated areas and only partial recruitment of atelectatic areas. Different strategies exist to find the level of PEEP in these patients: ARDSnet, guided by esophageal pressure, Stress Index, static airway pressure-volume curve. In such patients, some experts recommend limiting PEEP to low levels (~10cmH2O). In patients who have diffused loss of aeration PEEP can be used provided it does not cause the plateau pressure to rise above the upper inflection point.|$|E
50|$|Tire bubbles, also {{referred}} to as bulges / bumps / protrusions / carbuncles, occur when the sidewall of the tire has failed, resulting in a protrusion. Causes of bubbles include having an impact at high speed, <b>overinflation,</b> or poor tire construction/manufacturing. It is generally recommended to replace the tire since the probability of tire failure has increased. They can occur on the inner or outer sidewall.|$|E
50|$|In 8% {{of cases}} the {{buoyancy}} compensator malfunctioned. This was usually {{due to a}} problem with the inflator mechanism, but in some cases the BCD could not stay inflated. In 6% of the fatalities, the buoyancy compensator was not used competently, usually by <b>overinflation</b> which caused an uncontrolled ascent, or deflating when more buoyancy was required at the surface. Overweighting can also be classified as misuse of equipment.|$|E
50|$|Clinically {{significant}} atelectasis {{is generally}} visible on chest X-ray; findings can include lung opacification and/or loss of lung volume. Post-surgical atelectasis will be bibasal in pattern. Chest CT or Bronchoscopy {{may be necessary}} if the cause of atelectasis is not clinically apparent. Direct signs of atelectasis include displacement of interlobar fissures and mobile structures within the thorax, <b>overinflation</b> of the unaffected ipsilateral lobe or contralateral lung, and opacification of the collapsed lobe.|$|E
50|$|Congenital lobar {{emphysema}} (CLE), {{also known}} as congenital lobar <b>overinflation</b> and infantile lobar emphysema, is a neonatal condition associated with enlarged air spaces in the lungs of newborn children. It is diagnosed {{around the time of}} birth or in the first 6 months of life, occurring more often in boys than girls. CLE affects the upper lung lobes more than the lower lobes, and the left lung more often than the right lung. Although CLE may be caused by abnormal development of airways (bronchi, for example) or compression of airways by nearby tissues, no cause is identified in half of cases.|$|E
50|$|A true fetish is {{characterized}} in the DSM-IV by its social and occupational impedance. However, {{it is currently}} in the DSM-V (see Paraphilic Disorders) to where a fetish is no longer considered as a disorder (except for fetishistic disorder where if the fetish interferes with the person's life). Yet, fetishism is classified as code F65.0 in the ICD-10. Aside from these hazards, balloon fetishism carries with it the hazards of bursting balloons {{in close proximity to}} one's body. Eye and ear protection is recommended for such exposure to avoid eye damage or hearing loss. These hazards may be heightened since balloon fetishists often employ larger-than-average balloons and high-energy forms of popping them, such as <b>overinflation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The tire {{contact patch}} is readily changed by both over- and underinflation. <b>Overinflation</b> may {{increase}} the wear on the center contact patch, and underinflation will cause a concave tread, resulting in less center contact, though the overall contact patch will still be larger. Most modern tires will wear evenly at high tire pressures, but will degrade prematurely if underinflated. An increased tire pressure may decrease rolling resistance, and may also result in shorter stopping distances If tire pressure is too low, the tire contact patch is greatly increased. This increases rolling resistance, tire flexing, and friction between the road and tire. Under-inflation can lead to tire overheating, premature tread wear, and tread separation in severe cases.|$|E

5000|$|The ambu-bag was {{a further}} {{advancement}} in resuscitation. Introduced in the 1960s by the Danish company Ambu, this device allowed two rescuers to perform CPR and ventilation on a non-breathing patient with an acceptable chance of success. The ambu-bag has now mostly replaced the demand valve {{as the primary}} method of ventilation, largely due to concerns of potential over-inflation with the demand valve by untrained rescuers. The ambu-bag, unlike the older version of the demand valve (all new models of demand valve now have pressure relief valves set at 60 cm of water to prevent accidental <b>overinflation</b> of the lungs), has a [...] "pop-off" [...] valve to prevent inflation at greater than 40 pounds -per-square-inch (275.79 kilo-pascals), with the result being that it is generally {{more common in the}} pre-hospital setting than the demand valve. However, the demand valve remains popular with BLS providers, and in situations where conserving supplies of oxygen is of paramount importance. The demand valve, while less popular today than it was previously, still remains in service, albeit with important safety features added, including the addition of a pressure-relief valve to prevent over-inflation and the restriction of its flow to 40 liters a minute.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: High-frequency {{ventilation}} (HFV) {{may offer}} an attractive alternative to conventional {{strategies in the}} ventilation of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute lung injury (ALI) because it can minimize lung injury. Maintaining ventilation between lower and upper inflection points, it can warrant alveolar recruitment with probably reduced level of <b>overinflation.</b> The goal {{of this study was}} to compare alveolar recruitment and <b>overinflation</b> induced by HFV versus conventional mechanical ventilation with positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP), in three patients with ALI/ARDS. METHODS: This was a prospective study in an Intensive Care Unit of a University Hospital, evaluating three ALI/ARDS patients. Scanographic measurements were done, using special software (Lungview), during HFV and conventional ventilation with or without PEEP, in a randomised order. In HFV and PEEP mean airway pressure was kept constant. Lung density histograms were plotted. Alveolar recruitment was calculated as the percentages of air that entering in sick lung areas. <b>Overinflation</b> was calculated as lung volume under – 900 Hounsfield units. RESULTS: Lung density histograms were similar in both conditions. Alveolar recruitment was 49 ± 35 % versus 48 ± 27 % and <b>overinflation</b> was 15 ± 5 ml (0. 4 ± 0. 1 %) and 2 ± 2 ml (0. 1 ± 0. 1 %) in HFV and PEEP, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In the three patients evaluated application of HFV and conventional mechanical ventilation with PEEP showed, for the same mean airway pressure, similar lung density histograms as well as similar level of alveolar recruitment and lung <b>overinflation...</b>|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Lung-protective {{ventilation}} aims {{at using}} low tidal volumes (VT) at optimum positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP). Optimum PEEP should recruit atelectatic lung regions and avoid tidal recruitment and end-inspiratory <b>overinflation.</b> We examined {{the effect of}} VT and PEEP on ventilation distribution, regional respiratory system compliance (C(RS)), and end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) in an animal model of acute lung injury (ALI) and patients with ARDS by using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) with the aim to assess tidal recruitment and <b>overinflation.</b> METHODS: EIT examinations were performed in 10 anaesthetized pigs with normal lungs ventilated at 5 and 10 ml/kg body weight VT and 5 cmH 2 O PEEP. After ALI induction, 10 ml/kg VT and 10 cmH 2 O PEEP were applied. Afterwards, PEEP was set according to the pressure-volume curve. Animals were randomized to either low or high VT ventilation changed after 30 minutes in a crossover design. Ventilation distribution, regional C(RS) and changes in EELV were analyzed. The same measures were determined in five ARDS patients examined during low and high VT ventilation (6 and 10 (8) ml/kg) at three PEEP levels. RESULTS: In healthy animals, high compared to low VT increased C(RS) and ventilation in dependent lung regions implying tidal recruitment. ALI reduced C(RS) and EELV in all regions without changing ventilation distribution. Pressure-volume curve-derived PEEP of 21 ± 4 cmH 2 O (mean±SD) resulted in comparable increase in C(RS) in dependent and decrease in non-dependent regions at both VT. This implied that tidal recruitment was avoided but end-inspiratory <b>overinflation</b> was present irrespective of VT. In patients, regional C(RS) differences between low and high VT revealed high degree of tidal recruitment and low <b>overinflation</b> at 3 ± 1 cmH 2 O PEEP. Tidal recruitment decreased at 10 ± 1 cmH 2 O and was further reduced at 15 ± 2 cmH(2) O PEEP.
