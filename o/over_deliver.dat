40|$|With {{the rise}} of liquid soaps, and {{consumers}} becoming more environmentally conscious manufacturers have two duties of care; one being to ensure adequate bug inhibition {{and the other to}} ensure that an excessive burden is not placed on the environment by any benefit agent. [1, 2] Recently there have been concerns about the excessive use of certain benefit agents. [3] It is key to deliver the right amount of Triclosan (TC) to {{the right place at the}} right time so that at least the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration is delivered but not to <b>over</b> <b>deliver</b> which causes waste. The antibacterial TC has been studied as a model active ingredient in surfactant systems and on its own to contribute to the understanding of the lifecycle of active ingredients when used in soap formulations. The effect of TC in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and sodium laurate (SL) systems has been investigated using a range of physical chemistry techniques including UV-Vis and NMR to determine the increased solubility of TC in surfactant micelles. The effect of TC on the size and shape of SDS micelles has been examined using small angle neutron scattering. The surface tension of TC/ surfactant mixtures was studied to find the effects of TC on the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the surfactant solutions: TC decreases the CMC of SDS and the effect is pH dependant. The partitioning of the poorly water soluble TC is dependent on pH as well as the concentration of surfactant. It is important to understand the partitioning in these soap system to understand factors such as bioavailability and deposition. I have proposed a model for partitioning between free TC and TC in micelles, and between anionic and neutral forms based on an NMR study. The phenol form of TC partitions much more strongly into micelles than the phenolate: when there is 1...|$|E
