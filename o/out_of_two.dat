5|$|In February, Carlsen won the 3rd Grenke Chess Classic after a five-game tiebreak with Arkadij Naiditsch. Carlsen had {{finished}} joint first with Naiditsch on 4½/7, beating Michael Adams, Anand, and David Baramidze, and losing to Naiditsch in their classical encounter. This tournament victory meant that Carlsen began 2015 by winning two <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> tournaments. Carlsen continued his streak in April, winning Shamkir Chess {{with a score}} of 7/9 (+5–0=4), defeating Mamedyarov, Caruana, Vachier-Lagrave, Kramnik, and Rauf Mamedov. With a performance rating of 2983, this was Carlsen's third best tournament result ever, behind only Nanjing 2009 (3002 TPR) and London 2012 (2993 TPR).|$|E

5|$|Running back Michael Bush was {{predicted}} {{to return to}} form after suffering a foot injury that kept him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> games in November. Bush ran for 121yards and three touchdowns against Connecticut, his first game back from the injury. Heading into the Gator Bowl, Bush earned a school-record 24touchdowns and led the country in scoring. He ran for 1,049yards in nine games. He was also a capable receiver, catching 20passes for 245yards and a touchdown. But with Brohm on the sidelines, it was expected the Cardinals would rely on Bush's legs more than usual, {{in an effort to}} minimize the need for the inexperienced Cantwell to pass the ball.|$|E
5|$|This {{period of}} calm {{came to an}} end when the British consul in Rio de Janeiro nearly sparked a war between Great Britain and Brazil. He sent an {{ultimatum}} containing abusive demands arising <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> minor incidents at the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862. The Brazilian government refused to yield, and the consul issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil prepared itself for the imminent conflict, and coastal defenses were given permission to fire upon any British warship that tried to capture Brazilian merchant ships. The Brazilian government then severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.|$|E
5|$|This tranquility {{disappeared}} {{when the}} British consul in Rio de Janeiro, William Dougal Christie, nearly sparked {{a war between}} his nation and Brazil. Christie sent an ultimatum containing abusive demands arising <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> minor incidents {{at the end of}} 1861 and beginning of 1862. The first was the sinking of a commercial barque on the coast of Rio Grande do Sul after which its goods were pillaged by local inhabitants. The second was the arrest of drunken British officers who were causing a disturbance in the streets of Rio.|$|E

5|$|At least 25 laureates have {{received}} the Nobel Prize for contributions {{in the field of}} organic chemistry, more than any other field of chemistry. Two Nobel Prize laureates in Chemistry, Germans Richard Kuhn (1938) and Adolf Butenandt (1939), were not allowed by their government to accept the prize. They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> laureates to be awarded the Nobel prize twice in the same subject, in 1958 and 1980. John Bardeen is the other and was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1956 and 1972. Two others have won Nobel Prizes twice, one in chemistry and one in another subject: Maria Skłodowska-Curie (physics in 1903, chemistry in 1911) and Linus Pauling (chemistry in 1954, peace in 1962). As of 2017, the prize has been awarded to 177 individuals, including four women: Maria Skłodowska-Curie, Irène Joliot-Curie (1935), Dorothy Hodgkin (1964), and Ada Yonath (2009). There have been eight years in which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was not awarded.|$|E
5|$|During the 43 {{nomination}} years, 150 {{writers have}} had works nominated; 40 {{of them have}} won, including ties and co-authors. Only six writers or editors have won more than once. Jeffrey Ford has won the regular collection award three times out of four nominations, while Karen Joy Fowler, Lucius Shepard, and Gene Wolfe won the regular collection award twice, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>two,</b> four, and two nominations, respectively. Charles L. Grant and Kirby McCauley won the award as editors of anthologies while those were eligible; Grant was nominated nine times as an editor and once for a collection, while McCauley won both times he was nominated for anthologies. Grant's ten nominations are {{the most of any}} writer or editor, followed by Ramsey Campbell, Harlan Ellison, and Charles de Lint at five, with two of Campbell's nominations coming for anthologies. Dennis Etchison, Stephen King, Fritz Leiber, Kelly Link, and Stuart David Schiff have had the most nominations without winning at four; one of Etchison's and all of Schiff's nominations were for anthologies.|$|E
5|$|Holmes {{began his}} {{professional}} career {{playing for the}} Toronto Blueshirts of the National Hockey Association (NHA) in 1912–13. Holmes played with the Blueshirts for three seasons. In his first season with the Blueshirts, Holmes had a 6–7 (win-loss) record over 15 games with a shutout, and a 4.47goals-against average. The Blueshirts ended up missing the playoffs. In the 1913–14 season, Holmes' second season with the Blueshirts, he won the Stanley Cup for the first time. It {{was the first time}} a Toronto-based team won the Stanley Cup. In the NHA playoffs, Holmes won one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> games, and recorded a 1.00goals-against average and one shutout; in the Stanley Cup final, Holmes won all three games and finished with a 2.59goals-against average. The next season, the Blueshirts missed the playoffs, as Holmes had only eight victories over 20games, ending up with a 4.18goals-against average.|$|E

5|$|On December 12, 2000, the Tiger-Cats {{announced}} that they had re-signed Akins. Due to the CFL's import ratio requirements, Hamilton Spectator reporter Steve Milton speculated that Akins would be cut before the regular season. Instead, Akins made the regular season roster and regularly started at wide receiver {{for the first time}} in his career. Due to Akins' speed, he was moved to the slotback position in August. He later lost his starting position to wide receiver Corey Grant but continued to see regular playing time. Akins was held <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> games entirely near the end of the season to allow offensive lineman Gary Brown to return from the injured list. Akins' role as a receiver increased in the 2001 season, and he finished his season with 29 catches for 461 receiving yards. Conversely, his role as a kick and punt returner decreased substantially. Akins averaged 5.1 yards per punt return and 15.5 yards per kickoff return, decreasing from 10.3 yards and 24.0 yards in the 2000 season, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The bucket bong is made <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> {{container}}s, {{with the}} larger, {{open top container}} filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong {{is made up of}} only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Andres is one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> {{tropical}} cyclones {{on record}} to strike El Salvador. The first named storm {{of the active}} 1997 Pacific hurricane season, Andres formed on June 1 {{off the coast of}} Mexico. It initially moved toward the coast, although a change in steering winds turned the storm toward Mexico and Guatemala. After passing just offshore, Andres again changed direction toward the southeast, gradually weakening in the process. On June 7, it turned toward and hit El Salvador before dissipating. The storm brought rainfall to coastlines along much of its path, destroying some houses and inflicted damage. Two fishermen were reported missing in Nicaragua due to high seas, and there were four deaths in El Salvador.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Chicago, Brundage {{accepted}} a position as construction superintendent for John Griffith and Sons Contractors. Among the structures he worked on for Griffith were the Cook County Hospital, the Morrison Hotel, the Monroe Building, and the National Biscuit Company warehouse. In 1915, he struck {{out on his own}} in construction, founding the Avery Brundage Company, of which his uncle Edward was a director. Brundage continued his athletic career as well. He was US all-around champion in 1914, 1916, and 1918. Once he had ceased to be a track star, he took up handball. As a young man, he was ranked in the top ten in the country and even in 1934, at the age of 46, he won one game <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> against Angelo Trulio, who had recently been the US national champion.|$|E
5|$|Mutation bias {{effects are}} {{superimposed}} on other processes. If selection would favor either one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> mutations, {{but there is}} no extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population. Mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new, fully functional gene. Most loss of function mutations are selected against. But when selection is weak, mutation bias towards loss of function can affect evolution. For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost. This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias, and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss. Loss of sporulation ability in Bacillus subtilis during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias, rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability. When there is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective population size, indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift. In parasitic organisms, mutation bias leads to selection pressures as seen in Ehrlichia. Mutations are biased towards antigenic variants in outer-membrane proteins.|$|E
