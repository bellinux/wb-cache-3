40|$|Abstract This article {{reviews and}} categorizes {{empirical}} studies related to instructional technology that {{were published in}} three prominent journals: Educational Technology Research and Development, Instructional Science, and the Journal of Educational Computing Research from the year 2000 through 2004. Four questions guided this review: 1) What instructional technology research topics have been conducted? How do these topics fluctuate <b>over</b> the <b>five</b> <b>years?</b> 2) What types of research methods have been applied? How do these research methods fluctuate <b>over</b> the <b>five</b> <b>years?</b> 3) What data collection methods are prevalent in instructional technology research? How do these data collection methods fluctuate <b>over</b> the <b>five</b> <b>years?</b> and 4) In what settings have instructional technology research been conducted? How do these settings fluctuate <b>over</b> the <b>five</b> <b>years?</b> Based on these findings, we discuss current research trends and possible implications for which future research in instructional technology research can take...|$|R

Alan Wake was awarded the first spot in Time magazine's list of the top 10 video games of 2010. Alan Wake's American Nightmare, a full stand-alone title, was released in February 2012 on the Xbox Live Arcade service. A sequel was in development but was cancelled.

The toll houses were demolished, replaced by seating in 1868; investment income from the revenue accumulated during the 83years the tolls had been charged was sufficient to pay for the bridge's maintenance.|$|E
