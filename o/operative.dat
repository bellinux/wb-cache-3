Better players would be rewarded with access to the better <b>Operatives</b> to add to their teams, making those players even stronger. <b>Operatives</b> will be stylistically represented as trading cards, which can be sold, auctioned, traded and given to friends and other players.|$|R

25|$|At {{the same}} time, the United Textile Workers (UTW) {{attempted}} {{to break the}} strike, claiming {{to speak for the}} workers of Lawrence. The striking <b>operatives</b> ignored the UTW. The IWW had successfully united the <b>operatives</b> behind ethnic based leaders. These leaders, members of the strike committee, were able to communicate the message of Joseph Ettor to stage only peaceful demonstrations. Ettor did not consider intimidating <b>operatives</b> trying to enter the mills as breaking the peace. The IWW was successful, even with AFL affiliated <b>operatives,</b> because it defended the grievances of all <b>operatives</b> from all the mills. Conversely, the AFL and the mill owners preferred to keep negotiations between each mill and its own <b>operatives.</b> But in a move that frustrated the UTW, Oliver Christian, national secretary of the Loomfixers Association—an AFL affiliate itself—said he believed John Golden—Massachusetts UTW president—was a detriment to the cause of labor. This statement and missteps by William M. Wood quickly shifted public sentiment to favor the strikers.|$|R
