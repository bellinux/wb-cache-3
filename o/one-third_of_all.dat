5|$|Many {{objective}} measures {{show the}} positive impact of Hubble data on astronomy. Over 9,000 papers based on Hubble data {{have been published}} in peer-reviewed journals, and countless more have appeared in conference proceedings. Looking at papers several years after their publication, about <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> astronomy papers have no citations, while only 2% of papers based on Hubble data have no citations. On average, a paper based on Hubble data receives about twice as many citations as papers based on non-Hubble data. Of the 200 papers published each year that receive the most citations, about 10% are based on Hubble data.|$|E

Seventeen schools were selectedand 231 students were followed from school to home. Results showed that 15 % ofobserved subjects were involved in conflicts. Average walking time is 17 minutes;almost half of this time is spent either by walking on street or crossing. Femalesare involved in less conflict and they spend less time in traffic.

5|$|The Northwest Pacific Ocean is {{the most}} active basin on the planet, {{accounting}} for <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> tropical cyclone activity. Annually, an average of 25.7 tropical cyclones in the basin acquire tropical storm strength or greater; also, an average of 16 typhoons occurred each year during the 1968–1989 period. The basin occupies all the territory north of the equator and west of the International Date Line, including the South China Sea. The basin sees activity year-round; however, tropical activity is at its minimum in February and March.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Carol {{produced}} hurricane and gale force winds across New England. Strong winds from Hurricane Carol destroyed nearly 40% of the apple, corn, peach, {{and tomato}} crops from eastern Connecticut to Cape Cod. Overall crop damage {{was estimated at}} $22.25million. The hurricane destroyed several thousand homes in New England, {{many of which were}} destroyed from the waters or the powerful winds. Overall, 11,785families were directly impacted by the hurricane, including 9,720houses that were damaged and 1,545that were destroyed. High winds left over 150,000people without power in New England, potentially as many as <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> of New England, and many residents also lost phone service. The hurricane also destroyed 3,500cars and 3,000boats in the region. Heavy rainfall from the storm caused traffic accidents, but only minor flooding.|$|E

30|$|This study {{suggested}} that while many FMSs were conducting medical audits and providing feedback {{to their health}} clinics staff, {{less than half of}} the respondent perceived FMSs being involved in medical research and writing for publication. Every FMS who had graduated from any residency programs in Malaysia had in fact successfully conducted and completed a medical research. Abstracts of their studies might have been presented in scientific conferences. However, owing to the many duties and responsibilities of a public FMS, many might not be able to publish previous works or initiate new research projects (Weber-Main et al. 2013). It was reported that even in the United States only about <b>one-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the abstracts presented in family medicine and primary care conferences were actually published (Post et al. 2013). Thus, FMSs would need to enhance personal motivation, professional skills in research collaboration with other FMSs or academic FMSs in research project, scientific writing and publication. They may require practical support such as protected time, incentives and rewards in conducting and publishing researches in order to increase their research expertise and visibility (Weber-Main et al. 2013).|$|R
