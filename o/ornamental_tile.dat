5000|$|The {{successful}} {{operation of}} Philkeram {{during its first}} two years of its existence drew the attention of international investors. In 1963, the English Richard Tiles Ltd became a 50% partner in the company, renaming it to Philkeram - Richards S.A. This tripled the production and substantially increased the company’s exports.In 1966 Philkeram - Richards S.A. introduced, for the first time, the embossed tile, thereby increasing its exports to the EEC and the Middle East. The increased demand was dealt with investment in new equipment and the quadrupling of staff. In 1969 Richard Tiles Ltd merged with H & R Johnson Ltd, leading the company's title to be changed again to Philkeram - Johnson S.A. The invested capital reached 100,000,000 GRD, while the ownership structure is maintained at previous levels. The staff stood at 350 people and the sheltered company area covered 21,000 m2. In 1979, H & R Johnson was acquired by Nocros Plc, which today still owns 50% of Philkeram - Johnson S.A. In 1982 Industrial Mining S.A. is founded, which produces and markets building materials, with special expretise in tile adhesives and grouts.At first Philkeram Johnson produced only white square tiles (15x15 cm). Soon, however, the range spread to other colours. Then the company proceeded to install decorative machines that allowed the company to present a wider range of designs and colours, thus beginning the first exports. Development continued with the production of wall tiles of various dimensions as well as experimenting with and studying the production of tiles and flooring.After extensive research and testing, production began in new facilities in 1982. The main features of these facilities was not only flexibility in production but also a significant advantage in quality output. Foundations were placed for subsequent development in single-fired technology which were completed in August 1988. The production method of the single-fired tiles was based on Western European technology. Philkeram Johnson {{was one of the first}} units of its field who adopted and implemented this technology. This new method is automatic, producing high quality products, and is mainly used for flooring indoor and outdoor spaces, with the necessary technical specifications.In 1987, the company invested heavily in new technology. The same year a new product became available to the market, Kerastar. These are floor tiles for special purposes, made with the most innovative technological global developments and exceeding even the highest standards. The company participated in the exhibition tiles in Los Angeles, 1987, and was awarded second prize among 400 exhibitors, thus entering dynamically in the U.S. market.In 1994, Hippocampus S.A. was founded, focusing on the production of specific pieces for pools and accompanying <b>ornamental</b> <b>tiles.</b> The pool sector had to be separated, being an area which must strictly adhere to basic standards of safety and hygiene. Two years later, Philkeram Johnson was certified with the ISO: 9002, while Industrial Mining with ISO: 9001.In 2003, [...] "Jumpo I", a sophisticated production line is installed, an investment of €6.000.000 which radically changed the production structure of the company. Five years later, in 2008, the second sophisticated production line, [...] "Jumpo II", was installed, which premiered in October 2008 at an event attended by the Minister of Development. In these difficult economic times, the company dares to invest and modernize, expressing its willingness to strengthen and maintain leadership, but also continues to valuably contribute to society.|$|R

Többféle módszer egybevetése esetén is az ásatási megfigyelés adatai az elsődlegesek. 			 | 				Following {{the topic}} of the {{previous}} paper (HOLL 2005 a), we discuss questions of methodology – in this paper focusing on archaeological dating, considering possible sources of error, and critical use of the results. The most important, primary method is stratigraphy, which could establish the relative dating of the finds. Stratigraphical protocols should be followed through the excavations, and observations should be documented properly, as this is the cornerstone of authenticity, and thus one of the main responsibilities of the excavator. Critical analysis of style might be helpful for some archaeological material, especially for finding analogies. It helps with the material with artistic qualities – goldsmith’s work, <b>ornamental</b> pottery, stove <b>tiles,</b> architectural carved stones – too: in recognising workshops, or establishing dating. Although there are researchers, who deny the applicability, or refrain from using tipology, it is fundamental, used together with stratigraphy, for dating many finds. It uses stratigraphic information itself. Tipology is often unable to provide better dating than 50 – 100 years, but for certain types it can be more precise (in these cases datings are used even by those who would not attempt using tipology otherwise). The preconditions of tipology are: a priori grouping, and defining types within the groups, regional data collection, use of well-dated finds. Useful not only for dating, but can help finding regional/cultural differences, or finding destinations of long distance commerce. The use of written sources could help in absolute dating – but one needs to know its limitations (see Holl 2005 a, 181 – 182, also in the case of pictures). ...|$|R

Lokalitet se nalazi jugozapadno od središta Suhopolja, u Virovitičko − podravskoj županiji. Nastavljeno je istraživanje u prošlogodišnjoj sondi 1, gdje je istraženo deset novih grobova, a otvorena je i nova sonda na mjestu gdje se nazirala arhitektura od opeka. Rezultati su potvrdili očekivanja pa su u sondi 1 u jednom grobu pronađene karike sa S petljom, a u novoj sondi otkrivena je srednjovjekovna arhitektura od opeka i grobovi od kojih su istražena tri. The {{research}} on the position of Kliškovac was made possible through the financial support of the Croatian Ministry of Science, Education and Sports within the project “Medieval Archaeological Heritage in Croatia (5 th- 16 th ct.) ”. Leader of this project and of the {{research on}} Kliškovac is prof. dr. sc. Željko Tomičić. The research is a sequel to an experimental excavation from 2005, and this year the financial support, apart from the Ministry, was provided by the Authorities of the Municipality Suhopolje and the Foundation of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts (HAZU). The research was continued in trench 1, which was first investigated in the previous year. It was still not finished this year, because of the stratification of the burials on this position. In this trench, ten grave entities were investigated this year, out of which grave 33 with finds of jewelry (Fig. 3.) is the most interesting. We are dealing with six earing with S-loop, two of which were discovered {{on the left side of}} the scull, and four on the right side. Besides the earing with S-loop, tiny and extremely corroded iron fragments were found, seemingly parts of a costume, connected to the earing with S-loop. These finds are of importance for this site, because they provide clear information on the question of the period of burial on this cemetery, i. e. the 12 th and the first half of the 13 th century, more precisely the stage III of the culture of Bijelo Brdo. In the newly opened trench at the north side of the railway track, medieval brick architecture of a currently unclear function was discovered (Plan 1, Fig. 1.). According to the toponym of Kliškovac, a sacral object was supposed to be positioned here, and further research is supposed to show whether the architecture discovered belongs to an object of that type. On one of the discovered walls, medieval silver coins were also found. Apart from the medieval coins, numerous finds of late-medieval ceramics, <b>ornamental</b> glazed oven <b>tiles</b> and forged nails, discovered in the layers and fillings (Fig. 2.), are of importance for the temporal picture of the site. Based on previous research and finds, architecture, graves and toponyms, we may conclude that on this position, an ancestral cemetery of the culture of Bijelo Brdo existed in the 12 th and the first half of the 13 th century. There was also a later cemetery related to the sacral objects and a settlement in this position or in its immediate proximity...|$|R
