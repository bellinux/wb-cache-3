5|$|The Chalukyan architects {{retained}} features {{from both}} {{northern and southern}} styles. However, in the overall arrangement of the main temple and of the subsidiary shrines, they inclined towards the northern style and tended to build <b>one</b> <b>main</b> shrine with four minor shrines, making the structure a panchayatna or five-shrined complex. Chalukyan temples were, almost always, built facing the east.|$|E
5|$|Domains are a {{relatively}} new grouping. First proposed in 1977, Carl Woese's three-domain system was not generally accepted until later. <b>One</b> <b>main</b> characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of Archaea and Bacteria, previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called Monera), with the Eukaryota for all organisms whose cells contain a nucleus. A small number of scientists include a sixth kingdom, Archaea, but do not accept the domain method.|$|E

5|$|Traffic {{lights were}} downed by high winds, causing {{numerous}} traffic delays. Landslides along major roadways caused several accidents, one involving a bus that was damaged by rocks. One business was significantly damaged, {{with at least}} <b>one</b> <b>main</b> wall collapsing. To speed up the removal of debris, members of the Mexican army were deployed throughout Sinaloa. According to officials in Mexico, Tropical Depression One-E was the first known tropical cyclone to impact the state of Sinaloa {{during the month of}} June on record. With the system impacting land on June19, it marked the earliest date that a tropical cyclone had impacted the state, with the average date of first impact being August15.|$|E
5|$|McCudden's {{long-term}} interest in mechanics {{prompted him to}} modify his own aircraft to increase combat performance. He {{made a series of}} modifications to his aircraft which caused them to excel in performance in comparison to any other S.E.5 at the front and perhaps any other German fighter available at the time. Performance, a generic term, required improvements in all-round capability. McCudden's changes were made with <b>one</b> <b>main</b> objective in mind: high-altitude performance. He had achieved some success without these personal experiments. On 23 December 1917, for example, he intercepted an enemy aircraft at 18,000 feet and drove it down to 8,000 feet before shooting it down for his 30th victory. Incidentally, he was nearly killed in action when one of the wings broke away from his victim and nearly struck his own aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The Anderson Street Station had a wood {{siding with}} a {{shingled}} roof, two brick chimneys {{off the roof}} and two asphalt platforms in both directions. The station also had a garage door on the southern side of the building. No official style of architecture was mentioned for Anderson Street in the 1920 Final Engineering Report {{due to lack of}} design. Nearby, a wooden watchman's shanty was constructed near the team track. The station had two tracks run through it (<b>one</b> <b>main</b> track and a team track) and had a rail crossing between tracks. By 1870, the tracks had been extended northward to Hillsdale, and public service began on the line on March 4 of that year. Trains terminated at Hillsdale with fare of only $0.75 (1870 USD), but just one year later, the extension northward. The service was extended northward to the community of Haverstraw, New York, and in 1896, the rail line was leased by the private company to the Erie Railroad.|$|E

5|$|The bay {{has been}} {{strategically}} {{important for the}} military. General Zachary Taylor stationed his men on Rincon Point during the Mexican-American War, and a Union invasion was halted by Confederates on the same point in 1862, during the American Civil War. The Port of Corpus Christi {{was used by the}} Confederates to bring in supplies during the war effort until the Union bombarded Corpus Christi and occupied the bay and port from 1863 to 1870. In 1940, the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi was established on the bay, and by 1944 had transformed into a major base with <b>one</b> <b>main</b> air station and six additional stations. Notably, during a March 1960 practice run from the base, future Senator John McCain lost track of his altitude and speed, and his single-seat, single-pistoned-engine AD-6 Skyraider crashed into Corpus Christi Bay and sank to the bottom. He squeezed out of the cockpit, swam ten feet to the surface, and was carried to safety by a rescue helicopter, therefore escaping without major injuries.|$|E

The city's north district traffic police headquarters is located along Tebrau Road while the south district is in Skudai. There is <b>one</b> <b>main</b> prison called Johor Bahru Prison located in the city along the Ayer Molek road, but this has been closed down since 9 December 2005.

5|$|The {{design of}} a Floorless Coaster has <b>one</b> <b>main</b> {{difference}} from traditional steel roller coasters around the world: it has no floors between the seats. While a train is in the station, a floor is used only for loading and unloading purposes. Because the front row has nothing {{in front of it}} to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. The gate then opens, allowing the train to move forward. When the train returns to the station, the floor is brought back up and the gate is closed as the next riders board the roller coaster. Aside from the station, a Floorless Coaster has several inversions similar to B's Sitting Coasters.|$|E

5|$|The {{school has}} <b>one</b> <b>main</b> church, St Peter's, and five chapels: the Boys' Chapel, the Chapel of the Angels, the Sodality Chapel, the St Francis Chapel and the St Ignatius Chapel. The last two are {{both within the}} towers of St Peter's Church, and are not {{normally}} used by pupils. The Sodality Chapel {{is the home of}} the relics of the 3rd-century Roman convert St Gordianus. The Jesuits brought his remains from the College of St Omer and held them beneath the altar since 1859. His bones were temporarily removed in 2006 whilst the chapel underwent restoration, but they have since been returned. The chapel is again used by the re-established Sodality. Adjacent to the Old Infirmary is the Rosary Garden, a place for spiritual contemplation, at the centre of which is a stone statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary.|$|E
