5|$|On a computer, if {{the result}} of an {{addition}} is too large to store, an arithmetic <b>overflow</b> occurs, resulting in an incorrect answer. Unanticipated arithmetic <b>overflow</b> is a fairly common cause of program errors. Such <b>overflow</b> bugs may be hard to discover and diagnose because they may manifest themselves only for very large input data sets, which {{are less likely to be}} used in validation tests. One especially notable such error was the Y2K bug, where <b>overflow</b> errors due to using a 2-digit format for years caused significant computer problems in 2000.|$|E

5|$|The main {{rivers of}} Rùm were {{essentially}} just trickling streams, so Cranbourne {{came up with}} a plan to increase the power of the Kinloch River, by diverting the other two. In 1849, he built a dam at the end of Loch Sgathaig, allowing him to diverting the <b>overflow</b> into the Kilmory River (northwards), rather than the Abhainn Rhangail (southwards). In 1852, he attempted to dam the Kilmory River, half a mile north of Loch Sgathaig, the plan being to send the <b>overflow</b> into the Kinloch River via a short canal; unfortunately Salisbury's Dam collapsed shortly after being built.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of Apollo11 was to land safely {{rather than to}} touch down with precision on a particular spot. Three minutes into the lunar descent burn, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the Eagle would probably touch down beyond the planned landing zone by several miles. As the Eagles landing radar acquired the surface, several computer error alarms appeared. The first was a code 1202 alarm, and even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin was aware of what this code meant. They promptly received word from CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston that the alarms were not a concern; the 1202 and 1201 alarms were caused by an executive <b>overflow</b> in the lunar module computer. As described by Buzz Aldrin in the documentary In the Shadow of the Moon, the <b>overflow</b> condition was caused by his own counter-checklist choice of leaving the docking radar on during the landing process, so the computer had to process unnecessary radar data {{and did not have}} enough time to execute all tasks, dropping lower-priority ones. Aldrin stated that he did so with the {{objective of}} facilitating re-docking with the CM should an abort become necessary, not realizing that it would cause the <b>overflow</b> condition.|$|E

50|$|The United Kingdom Environment Agency {{identified}} unsatisfactory intermittent discharges {{and issued}} an Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive requiring action to limit pollution from combined sewer <b>overflows.</b> In 2009 the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment adopted a Canada-wide Strategy for the Management of Municipal Wastewater Effluent including national standards to (1) remove floating material from combined sewer <b>overflows,</b> (2) prevent combined sewer <b>overflows</b> during dry weather, and (3) prevent development or redevelopment from increasing frequency of combined sewer <b>overflows.</b>|$|R
50|$|CSOs {{should not}} be {{confused}} with sanitary sewer <b>overflows.</b> Sanitary sewer <b>overflows</b> are caused by sewer system obstructions, damage, or flows in excess of sewer capacity (rather than treatment plant capacity.) Sanitary sewer <b>overflows</b> may occur at any low spot in the sewer system rather than at the CSO relief structures. Absence of a diversion outfall often causes sanitary sewer <b>overflows</b> to flood residential structures and/or flow over traveled road surfaces before reaching natural drainage channels. Sanitary sewer <b>overflows</b> may cause greater health risks and environmental damage than CSOs if they occur during dry weather when there is no precipitation runoff to dilute and flush away sewage pollutants.|$|R
5|$|As with FreeBSD and OpenBSD, the {{developers}} of DragonFly BSD are slowly replacing K style C code with more modern, ANSI equivalents. Similar to other operating systems, DragonFly's {{version of the}} GNU Compiler Collection has an enhancement called the Stack-Smashing Protector (ProPolice) enabled by default, providing some additional protection against buffer <b>overflow</b> based attacks. It {{should be noted that}} , the kernel is no longer built with this protection by default.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Rewa {{started to}} affect New Caledonia on 5January, before it passed over Grand Terre Island later that day. Rewa dumped over 300mm (12in) of rain on {{parts of the}} archipelago, which made {{all of the major}} rivers <b>overflow</b> and burst their banks. Several {{landslides}} and a death were recorded within New Caledonia, while on the Loyalty Island of Mare, waves from Rewa partially destroyed the harbour wall at Tadine's port.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its initial}} threat, Chris caused little {{impact in the}} Lesser Antilles. Overall damage from Chris was minimal. The storm dropped light {{rainfall}} in Puerto Rico, peaking at 3.09inches (78mm) in Fajardo. The rainfall from the storm caused the Fajardo River to <b>overflow</b> its banks, which temporarily closed a highway in the northeastern portion of the island.|$|E
40|$|While {{numerous}} {{approaches have}} been proposed to prevent stack <b>overflows,</b> heap <b>overflows</b> remain both a security vulnerability and a frequent source of bugs. Previous approaches to preventing these <b>overflows</b> require source code or can slow programs down {{by a factor of}} two or more. We present HeapShield, an approach that prevents all library-based heap <b>overflows</b> at runtime. It works with arbitrary, unaltered binaries. It incurs no space overhead and is efficient, imposing minimal impact on real application performance (2 % on average). 1...|$|R

5|$|Some {{reaches of}} Keyser Creek {{experience}} total flow loss {{and there is}} no regular flow in the watershed's lower reaches. There are also extensive piles of culm and silts piled up in the creek's floodplain, left over from the coal mining era. There is at least one sanitary sewer <b>overflow</b> in the watershed. As of 2013, there are an estimated four stormwater detention facilities in the watershed. The creek has no perennial flow, since it loses flow to mine pools during dry weather. For this reason, it is unlikely to attain its designated uses. However, it still has flow during storms. During storm flows, the creek carries large amounts of sediment containing coal waste. Additionally, there are some discharges of rusty water into the creek, in addition to a combined sewer <b>overflow.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stafford Meadow Brook {{has very}} high water quality as far {{downstream}} {{as the old}} Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad corridor. The stream has received little impact from development above the Williams Bridge Reservoir. However, its banks are affected by urban debris such as yard waste {{in some parts of}} its lower reaches. Municipal sewers also sometimes <b>overflow</b> into the stream during rainy conditions. The borough of Moosic has a permit to discharge stormwater into the stream.|$|E
40|$|For open {{channels}} significant pollution sources {{during the}} intensive precipitations are outflows from storm-water <b>overflows</b> on the sewer network. When combined with low discharges in rivers, the water released from <b>overflows</b> can cause {{high concentration of}} pollution in receiving open channels. In this paper, the results of computer modeling {{of the impact of}} storm-water <b>overflows</b> on the stream water quality in three municipalities in Czech Republic are shown.
