5|$|Thelephora palmata (commonly {{known as}} the stinking earthfan or the fetid false coral) is a species of clavarioid fungus in the family Thelephoraceae. The fruit bodies are {{leathery}} and coral-like, with branches that are narrow at the base before widening <b>out</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fan and splitting into numerous flattened prongs. The wedge-like tips are whitish when young, but darken as the fungus matures. The common names of the fungus refers to its pungent odor, likened to fetid garlic. A widely distributed but uncommon species, it is found in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America, where it fruits {{on the ground in}} both coniferous and mixed forest.|$|E
5|$|Don meets Rachel {{for dinner}} {{to make amends}} for the meeting. During the dinner, Don says he is living life to extract {{the maximum amount of}} {{pleasure}} as there is no tomorrow, while Rachel recognizes in Don the element of the disconnected outsider, for whom the world is laid <b>out</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> puzzle waiting to be solved. The two of them begin to bond, and she agrees to give Sterling Cooper another shot. Meanwhile, Pete and some of his co-workers go to a gentlemen's club to celebrate Pete's impending wedding. There, a waitress rejects Pete's advances. Dejected from this rejection and Don's recent criticisms, Pete arrives drunk at Peggy's apartment, and she invites him in. Don takes a train to a large house in the suburbs, where he is greeted by his loving wife Betty (January Jones), whom he has made no mention of thus far in the episode. He checks on their two sleeping children as she watches admiringly from the doorway.|$|E

25|$|From 1937 to 1962, the LDS Church reacquired and {{restored}} the lot {{on which the}} temple stood. In 1999, church president Gordon B. Hinckley announced the rebuilding of the temple on its original footprint.

25|$|Ceratobasidium cornigerum is {{a species}} of fungus in the order Cantharellales. Basidiocarps (fruit bodies) are thin, spread on the {{substrate}} <b>out</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> film (effused) and web-like. A Rhizoctonia-like anamorphic state, sometimes referred to the genus Ceratorhiza, is frequently obtained when isolates are cultured. Ceratobasidium cornigerum is saprotrophic, but is also a facultative plant pathogen, causing a number of economically important crop diseases, and an orchid endomycorrhizal associate. The species is genetically diverse and is sometimes treated as a complex of closely related taxa.|$|E

Bonney {{followed}} the bird principle, abandoned the aileron, or balancing contrivance which airplane designers have always considered an essential feature of {{stability in the}} air. His plane had new features: an expanding and contracting tail, like a blackbird's, for varying loads; variable camber in the wings, {{so that they could}} flatten <b>out</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> gull's when flying level; a varying angle of incidence to its wings, so that they could turn sideways into the wind on landing...|$|E
25|$|Most {{reptiles}} lack {{a secondary}} palate, {{meaning that they}} must hold their breath while swallowing. Crocodilians have evolved a bony secondary palate {{that allows them to}} continue breathing while remaining submerged (and protect their brains against damage by struggling prey). Skinks (family Scincidae) also have evolved a bony secondary palate, to varying degrees. Snakes took a different approach and extended their trachea instead. Their tracheal extension sticks <b>out</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fleshy straw, and allows these animals to swallow large prey without suffering from asphyxiation.|$|E

25|$|The last match saw two US {{champion}}s the 2006 champion Maria Sharapova and {{the current}} champion Samantha Stosur. Stosur, the No.7 seed at the year-end finale, turned the tables {{on one of the}} most lopsided head-to-heads in the upper echelon of the women's game, coming <b>out</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> house on fire then surviving some tense moments to close out a No.2-ranked, No.2-seeded Sharapova in straight sets 6–1, 7–5. Having lost her last 11 sets in a row to Sharapova, Stosur stormed through the opening set in just 28 minutes, then rallied from 3–0 down in the second set, with Sharapova missing a backhand return on match point. Both players had a similar number of winners throughout the match – Stosur 18, Sharapova 17 – but Sharapova's 30 unforced errors far outweighed Stosur's 17 miscues.|$|E
25|$|Advantages of {{long-term}} use include rider {{familiarity with the}} bicycle and a mode of travel that is always nearby and instantly ready for use. The bicycle can be checked <b>out</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> library book, a liability waiver can be collected at check-out, and the bike can be returned any time. A Library Bike in a person's possession can be chosen for some trips instead of a car, thus lowering car usage. The long-term rental system generally results in fewer repair costs to the scheme administrator, as riders are incentivised to obtain minor maintenance {{in order to keep}} the bike in running order during the long rental period. Most of the long-term systems implemented to date are funded solely through charitable donations of second-hand bicycles, using unpaid volunteer labour to maintain, and administer the bicycle fleet. While reducing or eliminating the need for public funding, such a scheme imposes an outer limit to program expansion. The Arcata Bike Library, in California, has loaned over 4000 bicycles using this system.|$|E
