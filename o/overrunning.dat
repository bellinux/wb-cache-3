40|$|Abstract — Time <b>overruns</b> and Cost <b>overruns</b> {{has been}} a major issue in many Indian {{construction}} projects. The successful execution of construction projects and keeping them within prescribed schedule and cost is very important for effective time performance and cost performance. This research work is carried out on studying significant factors causing Time <b>overruns</b> and Cost <b>overruns</b> in Indian construction projects. A valid questionnaire for the survey was developed based on factors for time <b>overruns</b> and factors for cost <b>overruns</b> identified from literature review. These factors are grouped into 12 categories for time <b>overruns</b> and 8 categories for cost <b>overruns</b> and distributed to Contractors, Consultants, and Owners of Indian construction Industry. The data from the questionnaire was analyzed statistically. Relative important index method was used to found out the most significant factors affecting Time and Cost <b>overruns.</b> The result accomplished from the survey revealed that the major cause for time <b>overruns</b> are material market rate, contract modification, and high level of quality requirement and the major cause for cost <b>overruns</b> are high transportation cost, change in material specification, and escalation of materials price. The study findings highlight the significant factors and some recommendations are given to control time and cost <b>overruns</b> in Indian construction Industry...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{methodology}} {{similar to that}} used the in the worldwide research, the cost performance of Dutch large-scale transport infrastructure projects is determined. In the Netherlands, cost <b>overruns</b> are as common as cost underruns but because cost <b>overruns</b> are larger than cost underruns projects on average have a cost <b>overrun</b> of 16. 5 %. The focus on one country further enabled to consider cost <b>overruns</b> during different project development phases. It turned out that in the Netherlands the majority of the cost <b>overrun</b> occurs in the pre-construction phase (the period between the formal decision to build and the start of construction). The frequency as well as the magnitude of pre-construction cost <b>overrun</b> is significantly higher than in the construction phase. The used methodology of calculating cost <b>overruns</b> does however not take lock-in into account. This phenomenon shows that the real decision to build was taken much earlier in the decision-making process. Since estimated costs are usually lower during these earlier stages, the cost <b>overruns</b> based on this real decision to build are likely to be much higher. Cost <b>overruns</b> presented in studies are therefore often underestimated and the problem of cost <b>overruns</b> is much larger than we think...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} five essays, four on cost <b>overruns</b> {{and one on}} behavioral economics witha focus on real estate investments. The main aim of the thesis was to answer the questions: • Is it common with cost <b>overruns</b> in infrastructure projects? • What explains the cost <b>overruns?</b> • What {{can be done to}} prevent cost <b>overruns?</b> This thesis contributes to the current state of knowledge within the field: • It is yet another evidence that cost <b>overruns</b> are a significant problem. • Optimism bias is an explanation of cost <b>overruns.</b> However, the thesis adds, by Article two, arationality explanation. • Dismisses in part the Successive method as a tool to reduce cost <b>overruns.</b> • Provide recommendations on how action against cost <b>overruns</b> can be systematized. The first article, which is a result of my Licentiate thesis deals with real estate investments and the fact that investors sometimes are influenced by behavioral aspects that make them deviate fromwhat is rational. The result is some what uncertain but shows that investors in these cases were influenced by myopic behaviour. The second article deals with cost <b>overruns</b> and rationality. The question is whether it can be rational in a procurement, using a unit‐price contract, to expect cost <b>overruns.</b> The result shows that it is possible in situations where the decision maker has to take renegotiation costs and monitoring costs into account. The third article examines how well the successive method can pvents cost <b>overruns.</b> Established results in research on cost <b>overruns</b> indicated that strategic factors, psychological factors (optimism bias) and technical factors are important to explain cost <b>overruns.</b> The review suggests that the Successive method has limitations as a method to reduce cost <b>overruns</b> because it cannot deal with strategic and psychological factors. The fourth article focus on why cost <b>overruns</b> incurred. The article presents a new framework based on microeconomic cost theory and also results based on a survey to project managers in infrastructure projects, suggesting that cost <b>overruns</b> are common and that cost <b>overrun</b> mainly aredue to the optimism bias. The issue addressed in the fifth article is {{what can be done to}} prevent cost <b>overruns.</b> The conclusion, based on questionnaire survey and literature review, suggests that a variety of policy measures are needed at different levels such as (1) : Organizational macrostructure where e. g. cost <b>overruns</b> in a project in one region leads to less projects in that region. (2) Organizational quality: improved transparency within organizations to see where and when cost <b>overruns</b> occur. (3) Organizational processes: e. g. the use of external reviewers.

50|$|Recent {{works by}} Ahiaga-Dagbui and Smith {{suggests}} a rethink {{of what is}} traditionally referred to as <b>overruns</b> in construction.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} three independent explanatory {{variables and}} their relation with cost <b>overrun</b> {{in order to}} decide whether this is different for Dutch infrastructure projects compared to worldwide findings. The three independent variables are project type (road, rail, and fixed link projects), project size (measured in terms of estimated costs) {{and the length of}} the project implementation phase. For Dutch projects, average cost <b>overrun</b> is 10. 6 % for rail, 18. 6 % for roads and 21. 7 % for fixed links. For project size, small Dutch projects have the largest average percentage cost <b>overruns</b> but in terms of total <b>overrun,</b> large projects have a larger share. The length of the implementation phase and especially the length of the pre-construction phase are important determinants of cost <b>overruns</b> in the Netherlands. With each additional year of pre-construction, percentage cost <b>overrun</b> increases by five percentage points. In contrast, the length of the construction phase has hardly any influence on cost <b>overruns.</b> This is an important contribution to current knowledge about cost <b>overruns,</b> because the period in which projects are most prone to cost <b>overruns</b> is narrowed down considerably, at least in the Netherlands. This means that period can be focused on to determine the causes and cures of <b>overruns...</b>|$|R

Unlike previous analyses of cost <b>overruns,</b> we analyse projects over a long time period to capture the cyclical effects. We document a statistically significant positive relationship between oil price developments and cost <b>overruns,</b> with shocks or surprises to the oil price during the project implementation having a larger impact on cost <b>overruns</b> than the oil price level itself. Cost <b>overrun</b> ultimately leads to reduced competitiveness for the industry, and we discuss consequences and policy implications for business and society of these cost <b>overruns...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cost <b>overruns</b> are {{a global}} phenomenon. By {{assuming}} that companies are profit maximizing, we imply that inaccurate estimates of project costs are unwanted {{as the basis}} for investment analysis is weakened. The aim of this thesis is therefore to identify which factors affect the ability to set accurate budgets and meet the estimated costs. I highlight this topic by analyzing the differences in cost <b>overruns</b> between projects from the Norwegian oil industry and the public sector, by introducing macroeconomic variables for analysis and by looking into whether the cost <b>overruns</b> from one sector affects the other. Firstly, descriptive statistics and univariate regressions were run in order to obtain a better overview of the topic. Both public and oil projects are statistically more prone to cost <b>overruns</b> than underruns, however, oil projects experience <b>overruns</b> of larger magnitude. Public projects show a trend where increasing project size reduces cost <b>overruns,</b> while cost <b>overruns</b> in oil projects tend to increase with the duration of the project. To further analyze the dynamics of cost <b>overruns,</b> multivariate regressions were performed. This includes using forward selection by iterative processes in order to arrive at the final models. For oil projects, I find the variables Duration, Pension fund surprise, GDP growth and NCS investment surprise to significantly affect the magnitude of cost <b>overruns,</b> explaining about 25 % of the variability in cost <b>overruns</b> for oil projects. As for public projects, the corresponding model includes the variables Duration, Employment level, GDP from marine activities and Export, explaining about 13 % of the variability. The models above indicate that cost <b>overruns</b> in both sectors depend on the macroeconomic environment at the time of project execution. The explanatory power for the oil model is rather acceptable, however, I fail to find a good general model for cost <b>overruns</b> in public projects. When comparing the two sectors by running the models on the opposite dataset, no causal relationship in cost <b>overruns</b> between the two was found, and I therefore fail to confirm whether the different sectors affect the cost <b>overruns</b> of each other...|$|R

40|$|Cost <b>overrun</b> of {{transport}} projects {{is one of}} the most important problems in transport planning. Apart from causing budget <b>overruns,</b> it also results in uncertain cost-benefit for decision making. This thesis studies cost <b>overruns</b> in Sweden and internationally, factors affecting cost <b>overruns</b> and possible improvements of cost calculations. The literature study confirms that cost <b>overrun</b> problem is a global phenomenon. The average cost <b>overruns</b> in rail projects are always higher than in road projects. We have compared cost estimations and outcomes of 167 road and rail projects in Sweden during the period 1997 - 2009. This reveals that average cost <b>overruns</b> are 11 % (SD = 24. 6 %) and 21 % (SD = 50. 5 %) for road and rail projects, respectively. In Sweden, the average cost <b>overrun</b> in road projects is similar to other countries, while the average cost <b>overrun</b> in rail projects is lower than in other countries. However, the standard deviation of cost <b>overruns</b> in Swedish rail projects is very high. The cost <b>overruns</b> in road and rail projects in Sweden have been constant for the 13 -year period and cost estimates have not improved over time. Furthermore, small Swedish transport projects (< 100 million SEK) have much higher percentage of cost <b>overruns</b> than large projects. To improve cost estimates in Sweden, the Successive Calculation method has recently been applied. We have collected data for 295 planned projects and find that the variance is significantly lower in these than in actual outcomes, and that the difference is surprisingly small between projects in different planning stages. Another method, Reference Class Forecasting, is demonstrated in two case studies - Stockholm bypass and Västlänken. The two methods are also compared in the thesis. For both case studies, the project costs by using the Reference Class Forecasting method are higher than the project costs by using the Successive Calculation based on the equal costs at 50 % confident level of cost <b>overrun...</b>|$|R

As {{a result of}} failing the fulfillment of expected accuracy, the cost <b>overrun</b> of the projects would result.

However, cost <b>overrun</b> {{is one of the major}} negative consequences that may influence to the economy of a developing country, like Sri Lanka. In order to fill the aforesaid financial gap, the necessity of pumping additional funds through the consolidated fund by the GOSL would be arisen.
