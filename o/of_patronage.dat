He often criticized her decisions, which negatively affected their otherwise affectionate relationship.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, Scottish kings, {{particularly}} James V, built palaces in a Renaissance style, beginning at Linlithgow. The trend soon spread {{to members of}} the aristocracy. Painting was strongly influenced by Flemish art, with works commissioned from the continent and Flemings serving as court artists. While church art suffered iconoclasm and a loss <b>of</b> <b>patronage</b> {{as a result of the}} Reformation, house decoration and portraiture became significant for the wealthy, with George Jamesone emerging as the first major named artist in the early seventeenth century. Music also incorporated wider European influences although the Reformation caused a move from complex polyphonic church music to the simpler singing of metrical psalms. Combined with the Union of Crowns in 1603, the Reformation also removed the church and the court as sources <b>of</b> <b>patronage,</b> changing the direction of artistic creation and limiting its scope. In the early seventeenth century the major elements of the Renaissance began to give way to Stoicism, Mannerism and the Baroque.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Conservatives' {{ties to the}} CPR, Rutherford's Liberals {{enjoyed the}} incumbent's {{advantage}} of controlling the levers <b>of</b> <b>patronage,</b> and the election's result was never really in doubt. Before the election, Talbot predicted {{that the government would}} win 18 of the province's 25 seats. Immediately after the election it appeared that the Liberals had won 21; when all the votes had been counted they had won 23 seats to the Conservatives' two. Bennett himself was defeated in his Calgary riding. When the outcome was clear, the people of Strathcona feted Rutherford with a torchlight procession and bonfire.|$|E

5|$|Donnchadh's {{career is}} not well {{documented}} in the surviving sources. Charters provide a little information about some of his activities, but overall their usefulness is limited; this is because no charter-collections (called cartularies) from the Gaelic south-west have survived the Middle Ages, and the only surviving charters relevant to Donnchadh's career come from the heavily Normanised English-speaking area to the east. Principally, the relevant charters record his acts <b>of</b> <b>patronage</b> towards religious houses, but incidental details mentioned {{in the body of}} these texts and the witness lists subscribed to them are useful for other matters.|$|E
5|$|Hand still {{regarded}} {{his main}} job as judging. As circuit leader, {{he sought to}} free himself and his judges from too great an administrative burden. He concentrated on maintaining good relations with his fellow judges and on cleansing the court <b>of</b> <b>patronage</b> appointments. Despite the Manton case and constant friction {{between two of the}} court's judges, Charles Edward Clark and Jerome Frank, the Second Circuit under Hand earned {{a reputation as one of}} the best appeal courts in the country's history.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} art from what is now Scotland are highly decorated carved stone balls from the Neolithic period. From the Bronze Age there are examples of carvings, including the first representations of objects, and cup and ring marks. More extensive Scottish examples of patterned objects and gold work are found the Iron Age. Elaborately carved Pictish stones and impressive metalwork emerged in Scotland the early Middle Ages. The development of a common style of Insular art across Great Britain and Ireland influenced elaborate jewellery and illuminated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells. Only isolated examples survive of native artwork from the late Middle Ages and of works created or strongly influenced by artists of Flemish origin. The influence of the Renaissance {{can be seen in}} stone carving and painting from the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century the crown began to employ Flemish court painters who have left a portrait record of royalty. The Reformation removed a major source <b>of</b> <b>patronage</b> for art and limited the level of public display, but may have helped in the growth of secular domestic forms, particularly elaborate painting of roofs and walls. Although the loss of the court {{as a result of the}} Union of Crowns in 1603 removed another major source <b>of</b> <b>patronage,</b> the seventeenth century saw the emergence of the first significant native artists for whom names are extant, with figures such as George Jamesone and John Michael Wright.|$|E

The station building survives today and is close to Down Street's junction with Piccadilly. Part of it is now converted to a retail outlet.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{despite a}} {{symbolic}} emphasis on royal power, Henry's rule was relatively circumscribed and constitutional. He generally acted within {{the terms of}} the charters, which prevented the Crown from taking extrajudicial action against the barons, including the fines and expropriations that had been common under John. The charters did not address the sensitive issues of the appointment of royal advisers and the distribution <b>of</b> <b>patronage,</b> and they lacked any means of enforcement if the King chose to ignore them. Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court. The inconsistency with which he applied the charters {{over the course of his}} rule alienated many barons, even those within his own faction.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Oslo Airport {{location}} controversy, {{after the}} new airport was decided located to Gardermoen, there was a public discussion {{as to what to}} do with the general aviation which had operated from Fornebu. While some local aircraft owners wanted to keep a small part of Fornebu for general aviation, the authorities decided to close the airport completely. Instead, the general aviation was distributed to various private airports in Eastern Norway, including Notodden. In May 1998, Air Team started flights from Notodden to Bergen. Air Team gradually moved all its operations, including its pilot school, to Notodden. After Fornebu was closed in October, the airline experienced a quadrupling <b>of</b> <b>patronage,</b> as Gardermoen had given longer travel time for people in Buskerud and Telemark. In addition to business travel, the airline catered offshore workers commuting to the North Sea via Bergen. The airline stated that it intended to also open routes to Stavanger and Copenhagen.|$|E

5|$|Ashmole {{embarked}} on further catalogues, {{including one of}} the Roman coin collection of the Bodleian Library, which he finally completed in 1666 {{after eight years of}} work. It may have taken so long because Ashmole's progress was interrupted by the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, when Ashmole's loyalty was richly rewarded with political offices. He was appointed Secretary and Clerk of the Courts of Surinam and Comptroller of the White Office. While these two titles do not seem to have provided either an income or any specific duties, he also became Commissioner and then Comptroller for the Excise in London, and later was made the Accountant-General of the Excise, a position that made him responsible for {{a large portion of the}} King's revenue. These latter posts yielded him considerable income as well as considerable power <b>of</b> <b>patronage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system <b>of</b> <b>patronage</b> networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E

He entered national politics with his election to the United States House of Representatives in 1800, but was immediately tapped by Jefferson to become Attorney General. Lincoln served Jefferson as a consultant {{on the politics of}} New England, and was influential in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>patronage</b> in the region. He served on a commission that resolved claims emanating from the Yazoo land scandal in Georgia, and advised Jefferson on matters related to the Louisiana Purchase.|$|E

5|$|During {{its first}} month of operations, 125,971 {{passengers}} travelled on the Borders Railway. Demand was far in excess of what ScotRail had expected, with the line carrying 19.4% of its predicted annual patronage of 650,000 in one month. The unexpected level <b>of</b> <b>patronage</b> resulted in overcrowding on services and passengers unable to board at intermediate stations, leading ScotRail to run four or six carriages with morning and peak trains. ScotRail also leased additional parking space near Tweedbank station as the 235-space car park provided was generally full before 9am. The National Mining Museum near Newtongrange station reported a hike in visitor numbers, while the nearby towns of Melrose and St Boswells confirmed a rise in business and tourism.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the start}} of the Arab Spring in 2011, Gaddafi spoke out in favour of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, then {{threatened}} by the Tunisian Revolution. He suggested that Tunisia's people would be satisfied if Ben Ali introduced a Jamahiriyah system there. Fearing domestic protest, Libya's government implemented preventative measures by reducing food prices, purging the army leadership of potential defectors and releasing several Islamist prisoners. They proved ineffective, and on 17 February 2011, major protests broke out against Gaddafi's government. Unlike Tunisia or Egypt, Libya was largely religiously homogeneous and had no strong Islamist movement, but there was widespread dissatisfaction with the corruption and entrenched systems <b>of</b> <b>patronage,</b> while unemployment had reached around 30%.|$|E

5|$|Idris' {{government}} was increasingly unpopular {{by the latter}} 1960s; it had exacerbated Libya's traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralising the country's federal system {{in order to take}} advantage of the country's oil wealth, while corruption and entrenched systems <b>of</b> <b>patronage</b> were widespread throughout the oil industry. Arab nationalism was increasingly popular, and protests flared up following Egypt's 1967 defeat in the Six-Day War with Israel; allied to the Western powers, Idris' administration was seen as pro-Israeli. Anti-Western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with Egypt. By 1969, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was expecting segments of Libya's armed forces to launch a coup. Although claims have been made that they knew of Gaddafi's Free Officers Movement, they have since claimed ignorance, stating that they were monitoring Abdul Aziz Shalhi's Black Boots revolutionary group.|$|E
5|$|In April 1306, {{shortly before}} turning twenty-one, Edmund was granted {{possession}} of his father's title and land. On 22 May 1306, he was knighted by Edward I, {{along with the}} young Prince Edward– the future Edward II. The knighting was done in expectation of military service the Scottish Wars, and after the campaign was over, Arundel was richly rewarded. Edward I pardoned the young earl a debt of £4,234. This flow <b>of</b> <b>patronage</b> continued {{after the death of}} Edward I in 1307; in 1308 Edward II returned the hundred of Purslow to Arundel, an honour that Edward I had confiscated from Edmund's father. There were also official honours {{in the early years of}} Edward II's reign. At the new king's coronation on 25 February 1308, Arundel officiated as chief butler (or pincerna), a hereditary office of the earls of Arundel.|$|E
5|$|James VI (r. 1566–1625) {{was a major}} {{patron of}} the arts in general. He rebuilt the Chapel Royal at Stirling in 1594 and the choir was used for state {{occasions}} like the baptism of his son Henry. He followed the tradition of employing lutenists for his private entertainment, as did other members of his family. When he went south to take the throne of England in 1603 as James I, he removed one of the major sources <b>of</b> <b>patronage</b> in Scotland. The Chapel Royal now began to fall into disrepair, and the court in Westminster would be the only major source of royal musical patronage. Holyrood Abbey was remodelled as a chapel for Charles I's royal visit in 1633 and reclaimed by Charles II after the Restoration, becoming a centre of worship again during the future James VII's residency in the early 1680s, but was sacked by an anti-papist mob during the Glorious Revolution in 1688.|$|E
40|$|The {{book is a}} {{collection}} of nine essays which, as the introduction co-authored with David Drogin details, together provide the first critical assessment <b>of</b> the <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> Italian Renaissance sculpture. It takes into account the particularities of the medium that make sculptural patronage different from that of painting, especially ithe expense and durability of sculpture that made it suitable for display in public view. The book traces the remarkable appropriation <b>of</b> the <b>patronage</b> <b>of</b> sculpture by private citizens, who adapted its long-lived associations with civic and ecclesiastical bodies as they became increasingly bold in commissioning expensive works that encroached upon pubic space. Our introduction to the book discusses these issues while it takes a critical stance towards current literature, calling for the more subtle analysis <b>of</b> agency in <b>patronage</b> studies generally...|$|R
