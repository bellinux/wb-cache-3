5|$|Anna Schwartz {{collaborated with}} Friedman to produce one of monetarism's major works, A Monetary History of the United States (1963), which linked money {{supply to the}} {{business}} cycle. The Keynesians of the 1950s and 60s had adopted the view that monetary policy does not impact aggregate output or the business cycle based on evidence that, during the Great Depression, interest rates had been extremely low but output remained depressed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that Keynesians <b>only</b> <b>looked</b> at nominal rates and neglected the role inflation plays in real interest rates, which had been high {{during much of the}} Depression. In real terms, monetary policy had effectively been contractionary, putting downward pressure on output and employment, even though economists looking only at nominal rates thought monetary policy had been stimulative.|$|E
5|$|Quantum of Solace was {{the last}} in Ford Motor's three-film deal that began with 2002's Die Another Day. Although Ford sold over 90% of the Aston Martin company in 2007, the Aston Martin DBS V12 {{returned}} for the film's car chase around Lake Garda; Dan Bradley was hired as second unit director because of {{his work on the}} second and third Bourne films, so the film would continue the gritty action style begun in Casino Royale. He had intended to use Ford GTs for the opening chase, but it was replaced by the Alfa Romeo 159. After location filming in Italy, further close-ups of Craig, the cars and the truck were shot at Pinewood against a blue screen. Originally three Alfa Romeos were in the sequence: but Forster felt the scene was running too long and re-edited the scene so it <b>only</b> <b>looked</b> like two Romeos were chasing Bond. Six Aston Martins were destroyed during filming, {{and one of them was}} purchased by a fan.|$|E
5|$|Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) {{built an}} eight-foot foam {{model of the}} Zeppelin to {{complement}} shots of Ford and Connery climbing into the biplane. A biplane model with a two-foot wingspan {{was used for the}} shot of the biplane detaching. Stop motion animation was used for the shot of the German fighter's wings breaking off as it crashes through the tunnel. The tunnel was a 210 feet model that occupied 14 of ILM's parking spaces for two months. It was built in eight-foot sections, with hinges allowing each section to be opened to film through. Ford and Connery were filmed against bluescreen; the sequence required their car to have a dirty windscreen, but to make the integration easier this was removed and later composited into the shot. Dust and shadows were animated onto shots of the plane miniature to make it appear as if it disturbed rocks and dirt before it exploded. Several hundred tim-birds were used in the background shots of the seagulls striking the other plane; for the closer shots, ILM dropped feather-coated crosses onto the camera. These <b>only</b> <b>looked</b> convincing because the scene's quick cuts merely required shapes that suggested gulls. ILM's Wes Takahashi supervised the film's effects sequences.|$|E

25|$|Walker {{argues that}} the {{independent}} inquiry was flawed for two reasons. Firstly, because the time period over which it was conducted (August 2005 to January 2006) surrounded the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Ariel Sharon's stroke, which produced more positive coverage than usual. Furthermore, he wrote, the inquiry <b>only</b> <b>looked</b> at the BBC's domestic coverage, and excluded output on the BBC World Service and BBC World.|$|E

The team struggled {{in the first}} class matches, where they drew two and lost three matches, and <b>only</b> <b>looked</b> like having a chance of winning in the last match against Kent. The one-day series went slightly better, with Bangladesh A winning two, losing one and abandoning a fourth, but for a second string national team against mainly second elevens from English domestic cricket, it was a highly disappointing tour.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Bosson, Swann and Pennebaker tested seven {{measures}} of implicit self-esteem, including the birthday-number task and name-letter task, and four {{measures of}} explicit self-esteem. They used a 7-point rating scale {{instead of the}} 6-point scale Kitayama and Karasawa had used, and they <b>only</b> <b>looked</b> at {{the day of the}} birthday. On average respondents scored their birthday number 0.73 higher than the other numbers. When the researchers retested all seven implicit self-esteem measures, the birthday-number task was one of three that produced similar results. [...] From the weak or non-significant correlations between the implicit and explicit self-esteem measures they concluded that implicit and explicit self-esteem are tapping different underlying constructs.|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} {{move with the}} Yankees, Barrow brought Red Sox coach Paul Krichell with him to New York as a scout. He {{purchased}} {{a share in the}} club in 1924. He also discovered executive George Weiss, whom he mentored. [...] Barrow also orchestrated a series of trades with his former club, mainly to keep Frazee afloat. [...] These trades netted the Yankees such stars as Bullet Joe Bush, Joe Dugan and George Pipgras. [...] It has been argued that these trades <b>only</b> <b>looked</b> lopsided in favor of the Yankees only because the players sent to Boston suffered a rash of injuries. [...] However, this is belied by the fact that Barrow almost certainly knew who was coming to New York in these deals; he'd managed nearly all of them in Boston.|$|E
500|$|Audio {{tracks were}} mixed with {{recorded}} sounds from real subway cars, {{as well as}} PA system announcements, to make the episode sound more authentic. In the original episode, Pembleton grabbed Biedron by {{the collar of his}} shirt while Biedron sat {{in the back of a}} squad car during one of the final scenes. The scene was modified so that Pembleton <b>only</b> <b>looked</b> at Biedron, because Yoshimura felt that the scene was just as effective without him grabbing Biedron. During the last scene of the episode, in which Lange's girlfriend jogs by the subway station and ignores the emergency vehicles, Rabinowitz was originally instructed to include a musical score. He tried many different types of music, including rock music, Irish music, classical music, jazz, and piano riffs. When none of the music worked, Fontana suggested including no music at all, and it was agreed the silence was the most effective solution. Fontana said that after watching the episode repeatedly during the editing process, he liked the final product but doubted he would watch it again for a long time because it was [...] "too emotionally draining".|$|E
500|$|The Verge {{gave the}} HTC One an 8.3 out of 10; {{aside from the}} {{positioning}} of its power button and navigation keys, which {{were considered to be}} hard to reach, its hardware design was praised for having a [...] "totally unique and somehow still understated" [...] look, while its 1080p display was considered {{to be one of the}} sharpest displays on a smartphone—although not bright enough to be seen properly in direct sunlight. In combination with its stereo speakers, the One was considered a good phone for viewing videos and playing games, while its call quality was judged as being sufficient. In regards to performance, the HTC One was considered to be [...] "an impressively powerful phone across the board" [...] due to its high scores on various benchmark tests. Its camera received mixed reviews; while it had better low-light performance than its competitors as advertised, the One’s photos were criticized for looking [...] "soft and mushy" [...] due to extensive post-processing and <b>only</b> <b>looked</b> relatively good at the smaller sizes applied by services such as Facebook and Instagram. The Zoe features were considered unique and useful, but the HTC Share service was panned for being [...] "kind of like Vine, except [...] your clips only last a few months and no one’s ever going to use it." [...] The One was also criticized for its [...] "decidedly average" [...] battery life, and for some of the [...] "unintuitive" [...] design changes that HTC made to the Android UI.|$|E

500|$|Paul Gadbois, {{developer}} at Beenox Studios, {{identified that}} their {{goal for the}} game was {{to focus on the}} music from the past games in the Guitar Hero series, and that the selection of the soundtrack was one of the core features they focused on first. Songs were selected based on several factors, including songs that were not formerly available to Wii and PlayStation 3 owners, and songs that played well in both single player and band modes. They also thought of playing the [...] "greatest songs" [...] in the [...] "greatest places", and developed eight new venues based on Wonders of the World, including [...] "Amazon Rain Forest", [...] "The Polar Ice Caps" [...] and [...] "The Grand Canyon". The team opted to reuse the original Guitar Hero characters instead of attempting to bring in musical celebrities as was done in Guitar Hero World Tour and Guitar Hero: Metallica, fearing that the star power would have outshone the music selection. Beenox performed all of the major development efforts, including designing the venues, selecting the songs, and creating the note tracks, though Neversoft provided their own development tools and provided Beenox with their own insight from developing the other Guitar Hero games in the series. While the Beenox developers were provided with the note charts from the songs in their original games, they <b>only</b> <b>looked</b> at these after developing new charts for the songs on their own, and modified their new charts to accommodate sections from the originals that made them fun to play in the first place. The game's full setlist was revealed over the course of April and May 2009 by allowing users to vote on the order of the remastered tracks from the four previous games.|$|E

2500|$|The gandharva Kali was in {{love with}} Varuthini and had been {{rejected}} by her in the past. He saw how she hungered for the Brahmin, so he took on the appearance of Pravara and came before the courtesan. He led her into the bedchamber and told her to close her eyes during their sex [...] [...] As they made love, Varuthini noticed that his body became flaming hot and believed it was because his Brahmin spirit was infused with the sacrificial fire. After climax, Kali, still-as-Pravara, left the apsara and returned to his abode. Varuthini soon became pregnant and nine months later gave birth to a human child that not <b>only</b> <b>looked</b> like the Brahmin but possessed his soul as well. The authors of the book Science in Culture comment this was an example of the Sanskrit phrase [...] "from his semen and from her thinking," [...] meaning the child was indeed Pravara's child because she believed it was his.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2012, WKMG-TV {{television}} in Orlando reported that police never investigated Firefox browser evidence on Casey Anthony's computer {{the day of}} Caylee's death; they <b>only</b> <b>looked</b> at Internet Explorer evidence. The browser history showed that someone at the Anthony household, using a password-protected account Casey Anthony used, did a Firefox Google search for [...] "foolproof suffocation" [...] at 2:51p.m. and then clicked on an article criticizing pro-suicide websites promoting [...] "foolproof" [...] ways to die, including the idea of committing suicide by taking poison and putting a plastic bag over one's head. The browser then recorded activity on MySpace, a site used by Casey Anthony but not George Anthony. The station learned about this information from Casey Anthony's attorney Jose Baez who mentioned it in his book on the case, speculating that George had contemplated suicide after Caylee's death. He conceded to reporters that the records are open to interpretation; however, he speculated that the state may {{have chosen not to}} introduce the search at trial because, according to Baez, the computer records tend to refute the timeline stated by George Anthony, which was that Casey left at 12:50p.m. An analysis by John Goetz, a retired engineer and computer expert in Connecticut, revealed that her password-protected computer account shows activity on the home computer at 1:39p.m., with activity on her AIM account, as well as MySpace and Facebook.|$|E
2500|$|In 1924, John Wilkinson {{left the}} company, {{allegedly}} though never verified, after a falling-out with Herbert Franklin over the insistence by Franklin {{that the new}} designs should [...] "look more like other cars." [...] The company had {{taken a lot of}} criticism in the popular press and from dealerships because of their unconventional front hood that didn't sport a radiator. Franklin had recently hired [...] J. Frank de Causse, a well-known car designer who had previously worked on the Rolls Royce and Locomobile. Wilkinson may have been alarmed when a new model, designed by de Causse, [...] "wore a fake radiator-grille shell {{to make up for the}} fact that Franklin cars did not have a radiator. Wilkinson, who had always strived for light weight and form following function, could have felt that the faux grille not <b>only</b> <b>looked</b> out of place, but it also weighed more than the traditional one-piece aluminum hood grille that he had designed. [...] It is more likely, however, that Wilkinson left the company well before the deCausse car was designed for other reasons. [...] Since the inception, all engineering was Wilkinson's responsibility, and all sales and business was HH Franklin's responsibility, and there was a tacit understanding that neither would interfere in the other's territory. [...] But a series of small instances began to occur in the early 1920s which appeared to challenge Wilkinson's authority—the Model Z affair, the Stromberg carburetor—culminating with HHF's decision to change the appearance of the car. These were business decisions, for Wilkinson should have been well aware that he could not make advancements in engineering without money from the business, but it could have still been more than John Wilkinson was willing to bear.|$|E
