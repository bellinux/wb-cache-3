5|$|Baird was {{the first}} cabinet {{minister}} to support Jim Flaherty's campaign to succeed Mike Harris as Progressive Conservative Party leader in the party's 2002 leadership election. The election was won by Flaherty's rival Ernie Eves, and early media reports suggested that Baird might be dropped from the new premier's cabinet in April 2002.

5|$|Closely {{related to}} power metal is {{progressive}} metal, which adopts the complex compositional approach of bands like Rush and King Crimson.

30|$|Now, {{it seems}} to me that, at least in Western Europe, <b>the</b> <b>progressives</b> (i.e., <b>the</b> left) have always embraced <b>the</b> option <b>of</b> {{inclusive}} solidarity: they have always been solidary (in <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> attributing priority to <b>the</b> norm <b>of</b> equality over <b>the</b> norms <b>of</b> reciprocity and self-reliance), and multicultural (in <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> favoring international solidarity and inclusiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national solidarity). The problem for <b>the</b> <b>progressives</b> is that their traditional constituency has not followed suit, but has been attracted by <b>the</b> appeals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new populist right, which, in response to its success in the working class, has gradually been shifting its position from its original nationalist neoliberalism towards welfare chauvinism and welfare populism. As a result of these corresponding shifts on the demand and <b>the</b> supply side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political space, the progressives’ constituency has become predominantly middle class. More specifically, it has become dominated by the social and cultural professionals who form a key segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new middle class and for whom <b>the</b> inclusive solidarity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>progressives</b> has been most appealing. Formulated in somewhat different terms, <b>the</b> dilemma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>progressives</b> (<b>the</b> left) is that they need to forge an alliance between their traditional and their new constituencies both of whom agree in terms of national solidarity, but who could not be more different in terms of inclusion. Or, more pointedly, <b>the</b> core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dilemma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>progressives</b> is that their traditional constituency does not endorse multiculturalism.|$|R

5|$|The party split grew, and in 1912, Taft and Roosevelt were rivals for the Republican nomination. The 1912 Republican National Convention was bitterly divided. At Taft's request, Harding gave {{a speech}} nominating the president, but the angry delegates were not {{receptive}} to Harding's oratory. Taft was renominated, but Roosevelt supporters bolted the party. Harding, as a loyal Republican, supported Taft. The Republican vote was split between Taft, the party's official candidate, and Roosevelt, running under the label <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Progressive</b> Party. This allowed the Democratic candidate, New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson, to be elected.|$|E
5|$|Thick as a Brick {{was viewed}} by some critics as Jethro Tull's first {{progressive}} rock album.

Although the finished album runs as one continuous piece, it is made up of a medley of individual songs that run into each other, none of which individually lasts {{more than a couple of}} minutes. Parts of the suite blend classical and folk music into the typical rock music framework.|$|E
5|$|A {{period of}} {{rebellion}} {{at the start}} of the 19th century led to the rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>progressive</b> Sultan Mahmud II and eventually to the Tanzimat period, which produced political reforms and allowed new technology to be introduced to the city. Bridges across the Golden Horn were constructed during this period, and Istanbul was connected to the rest of the European railway network in the 1880s. Modern facilities, such as a water supply network, electricity, telephones, and trams, were gradually introduced to Istanbul over the following decades, although later than to other European cities. The modernization efforts were not enough to forestall the decline of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
