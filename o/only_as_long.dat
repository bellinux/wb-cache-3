A unified political {{system could be}} maintained <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the government had the means of quickly dispatching officials, troops, or messengers as needed.

5|$|Although the Loons were afforded {{respect as}} {{principal}} peace chiefs, this status was not permanent. The Cranes, led in Buffalo's time by his sub-chief Tagwagane, maintained {{that they were}} the hereditary chiefs. They said the Loons' status as spokesmen hinged upon recognition by the Cranes. A chief's power in Ojibwa society was based on persuasion and consensus; it was contingent, holding <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the community of elders, including the women, chose to respect and follow the chief's lead.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{originating}} {{theories on}} the entrepreneur and spatial economics, Cantillon {{also provided a}} dedicated theory on population growth. Unlike William Petty, who believed there always existed {{a considerable amount of}} unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as there are economic opportunities present. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon's population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth, including the tendency for population growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.|$|E

5|$|The GCD of two numbers a and b is {{the product}} of the prime factors shared by the two numbers, where a same prime factor can be used {{multiple}} times, but <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the product of these factors divides both a and b. For example, since 1386 can be factored into 2×3×3×7×11, and 3213 can be factored into 3×3×3×7×17, the greatest common divisor of 1386 and 3213 equals 63=3×3×7, the product of their shared prime factors. If two numbers have no prime factors in common, their greatest common divisor is 1 (obtained here as an instance of the empty product), in other words they are coprime. A key advantage of the Euclidean algorithm is that it can find the GCD efficiently without having to compute the prime factors. Factorization of large integers is believed to be a computationally very difficult problem, and the security of many widely used cryptographic protocols is based upon its infeasibility.|$|E
5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} team sent {{north on}} the evening of July 5 reported seeing tanks south of Osan. The team attempted to destroy a tank it spotted in the village of Sojong but was unsuccessful; it suffered one killed (Private Kenneth R. Shadrick) and was forced to return to Pyongtaek. Shortly after, several survivors from Task Force Smith arrived at 1st Battalion's command post telling stories of their defeat at Osan, but Ayres did not believe they were accurate. Brigadier General George B. Barth, acting division artillery commander for the 24th Infantry Division, stopped by the command post and ordered that the battalion hold <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as it could, and not to risk being flanked or surrounded, wary of the defeat at Osan. Barth then moved to the 34th Infantry Regiment's command where he ordered regimental commander Colonel Jay B. Lovless to consolidate the Regiment at Cheonan to the south. Lovless subsequently moved 3rd Battalion south, without having ever engaged the enemy. Barth believed the 34th Infantry {{would not be able to}} defend Pyongtaek as long as the 21st Infantry defended Osan. From 3rd Battalion, L Company was detached and ordered to hold south of Pyongtaek to cover the 1st Battalion when it retreated. This order was not carried out, and L Company left for Chonan.|$|E

5|$|Vowel length. The {{pronunciation}} of {{long and}} short vowels depends on the syllable's position in the word. In word-initial syllables there is a phonemic contrast in length. A long vowel has about 208% {{the length of a}} short vowel. In word-medial and word-final syllables, formerly long vowels are now <b>only</b> 127% <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> short vowels in initial syllables, but they are still distinct from initial-syllable short vowels. Short vowels in noninitial syllables differ from short vowels in initial syllables by being <b>only</b> 71% <b>as</b> <b>long</b> and by being centralized in articulation. As they are nonphonemic, their position is determined according to phonotactic requirements.|$|R

The Rainbow Family organizes gatherings in National Forests of the United States each year around age old models of ad hoc mutual aid.|$|E
25|$|These {{mutations}} have {{a common}} end result; they destabilise the cytoskeletal scaffold of cells. This stability is especially important in erythrocytes as they are constantly {{under the influence of}} deforming shear forces. As disc-shaped erythrocytes pass through capillaries, which can be 2-3 micrometres wide, they are forced to assume an elliptical shape in order to fit through. Normally, this deformation lasts <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as a cell is present in a capillary, but in hereditary elliptocytosis the instability of the cytoskeleton means that erythrocytes deformed by passing through a capillary are forever rendered elliptical. These elliptical cells are taken up by the spleen and removed from circulation when they are younger than they would normally be, meaning that the erythrocytes of people with hereditary elliptocytosis have a shorter than average life-span (a normal person's erythrocytes average 120 days or more).|$|E

30|$|Thus the Markov chain model (and the {{associated}} diffusion approximation) is <b>only</b> appropriate <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> {{the distance between}} the individual populations is large enough.

25|$|Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) {{equations}} are {{the oldest}} approach to turbulence modeling. An ensemble {{version of the}} governing equations is solved, which introduces new apparent stresses known as Reynolds stresses. This adds a second order tensor of unknowns for which various models can provide different levels of closure. It is a common misconception that the RANS equations {{do not apply to}} flows with a time-varying mean flow because these equations are 'time-averaged'. In fact, statistically unsteady (or non-stationary) flows can equally be treated. This is sometimes referred to as URANS. There is nothing inherent in Reynolds averaging to preclude this, but the turbulence models used to close the equations are valid <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the time over which these changes in the mean occur is large compared to the time scales of the turbulent motion containing most of the energy.|$|E
25|$|In April 1874, Robert E. and Mary Lee's eldest son, George Washington Custis Lee, petitioned Congress {{for payment}} for the Arlington estate. Lee argued that tax sale of the entire {{property}} (rather than just that portion needed to pay the tax debt) amounted to confiscation and was unconstitutional. He also argued that the tax collectors' refusal to accept payment made the proceedings null and void. Finally, he asserted {{that the federal government}} should only be able to secure a life interest in the property (in other words, seize it <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as Mary Lee lived) and could not assert title to the estate without the consent of the state of Virginia. He offered not to litigate the seizure of Arlington if paid. Lee's petition was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary on April 6, but it was not acted on.|$|E
25|$|Cromwell {{was safe}} <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as he {{retained}} royal favour.

Cromwell realised that a divorce would result in a massive loss of face for him as the promoter of the marriage and its associated political machinations and that it could lead, not only to his ruin, but {{to the end of the}} Reformation in England. He made the fatal mistake of hesitating when the king asked him to look to a solution to end the marriage. Taking advantage of the king's marital discontent and Thomas Cromwell's hesitation over the divorce, Gardiner and the Norfolk together came up with a plan to bring down the Earl of Essex. Norfolk used his pretty, young niece, Catherine Howard at court, to distract the king, and while Henry VIII was distracted, he and Gardiner plotted their rival's demise. Stephen Gardiner entertained the king and the girl in his episcopal palace, while their agents were searching for any damning evidence that could be used against Cromwell.|$|E
