In this paper, numerical method is used to investigate the fluid flow characteristics and the valve core movement inside PCGV under different <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing times of pilot valve. The result shows that, shorter <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing time of valve core results in the shorter vibration of valve core {{as well as the}} stronger unstable fluid in main valve <b>and</b> faster <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing process of PCGV. Longer <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing time of valve core can do less damage to valve body. This work can give some guides for the optimal design work of PCGV and someone who are researching on valves with similar structures...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing {{strategies}} of Malaysian vlogs. Aside from these strategies, the non-verbal communication of the vloggers are analysed as well. This paper also investigates the vlog viewers’ perception regarding the importance of <b>openings</b> <b>and</b> closings in vlogs. Frobenius’s (2011) taxonomy of <b>opening</b> strategies <b>and</b> Coronel-Molina’s (1998) closing strategies are used as the framework for analyzing the data. Qualitative research is {{used to examine the}} data, which consists of 30 monologue vlogs from YouTube. The <b>openings</b> <b>and</b> closings of the vloggers are analysed using Conversation Analysis (CA). This approach facilitates the transcription of their monologues and the study {{of the structure of the}} <b>openings</b> <b>and</b> closings. Meanwhile, 40 viewers are interviewed online to obtain their opinions of <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing sequences. Content analysis is employed to inspect the responses of the viewers as it allows the extraction of lexical items that reflect their opinions. Apart from Frobenius’s (2011) strategies, the Malaysian vloggers used four other types of opening strategies: small talk, pleasantries, request for feedback and apologies. They also used three other closing strategies, which are not found in Coronel-Molina’s (1998) data: apologies, request for feedback and self-identification. Such findings suggest that <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing strategies are influenced by social and cultural expectations. Furthermore, the interview results show that Malaysian viewers generally consider <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing sequences important as they believe these sequences serve necessary functions.

40|$|The {{governor}} actuators in some heat-engine {{plants have}} nonlinear valves. This nonlinearity of valves {{may lead to}} the inaccuracy of the <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing time constants calculated based on the whole segment fully open and fully close experimental test curves of the valve. An improved mathematical model of the turbine governor actuator is proposed to reflect the nonlinearity of the valve, in which the main <b>and</b> auxiliary piecewise <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing time constants instead of the fixed oil motive <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing time constants are adopted to describe the characteristics of the actuator. The main <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing time constants are obtained from the linear segments of the whole fully open and close curves. The parameters of proportional integral derivative (PID) controller are identified based on the small disturbance experimental tests of the valve. Then the auxiliary <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing time constants <b>and</b> the piecewise <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing valve points are determined by the fully open/close experimental tests. Several testing functions are selected to compare genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm (GA-PSO) with other basic intelligence algorithms. The effectiveness of the piecewise linear model and its parameters are validated by practical power plant case studies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Early {{stages of}} aortic valve disease involve a subtle {{increase}} in leaflet stiffness which affects valve performance seen {{particularly in the}} <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing of the valve. In this study, a pulse duplicator which recreates physiologic flow waveforms {{was used to evaluate}} how changes in experimental conditions such as downstream resistance and flow rate affect the <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing patterns of valves with varying stiffness. A photographic technique which allowed for analysis of valve leaflet motion revealed various trends in relation to the flow, resistance, and stiffness of the valves. Increased flow and resistance lead towards shorter <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing times for the valves, while increased valve stiffness demonstrated an increase in the <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing times of the valves. Pressure drops across the aortic valves decreased during the closing cycles as the area decreased, and increased during the opening cycles as the area increased. These results indicate that hemodynamic factors influence the severity of the disease as demonstrated by the trends observed during the <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing cycles of the valve. 1...|$|R
