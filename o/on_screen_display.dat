Points are scored by winning a round, a round consists of 3 matches in Battlemode or Scrum. The number of matches per round may be varied in game, an <b>on</b> <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> will inform you of the current game settings and clearly shows the number of matches required to win the round. A single team point is awarded for each round won, however if a team wins the round without their opposing team winning a match then two team points are awarded. Individual scoring is based upon a single point for every kill in battlemode and a single point for every goal scored in scrum.|$|E
50|$|The {{videocassette}} recorder {{remained in}} home use throughout the 1980s and 1990s, despite {{the advent of}} competing technologies such as LaserDisc (LD) and Video CD (VCD). While Laserdisc offered higher quality video and audio, the discs are heavy (weighing about one pound each), cumbersome, much more prone to damage if dropped or mishandled, and furthermore only home LD players, not recorders, were available. The VCD format found a niche with Asian film imports, but did not sell widely. Many Hollywood studios did not release feature films on VCD in North America because the VCD format had no means of preventing perfect copies being made on CD-R discs, which were already popular when the format was introduced. In an attempt to lower costs, manufacturers began dropping nonessential features from their VCR models. The built-in display was dropped in favor of <b>on</b> <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> for setup, programming, and status, and many buttons were eliminated from the VCR's front panel, their functions accessible only from the VCR's remote control.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{a version}} of the popular {{computer}} game Tetris was developed. The game was fully implemented in the VHDL hardware design language with a focus on modular design. A module was developed for operations on the active element that implements horizontal movement, rotations, falling and fast descent. Other game logic was implemented in the module for pseudorandom selection of next element and the module for full row removal. Both of these were connected to the developed module for the playing field. <b>On</b> <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> was implemented in the developed module for display of characters and the module for pipelined rendering, the later of which represents the top level hardware-independent module. Several hardware-dependent modules were developed for interacting with the player: a 7 -segment display controller, a VGA controller and a module for tactile buttons. These modules were all connected with the game via a hardware-dependent top level module for the Digilent Nexys 4 development board...|$|E

40|$|Analysis and {{observation}} of the user’s task domain unveils a window of understanding into the behavioural patterns, contexts and scenarios that are required and utilized by users to attain success in completing a task. Task Analysis (TA) forms the foundation for interaction, behavior and usage since prioritisation of design elements is a serious issue for both users and designers. Successful User Interface (UI) designs often utilise insight into tasks by studying user interactions, intentions, and expectations. User interaction itself amounts to the interplay of cognition and information processing as embodied by task routines or sequences that are commonly captured in a TA. This chapter will focus on procedures for uncovering cognitive processes relative to user goals and tasks including decision-making systems, the impact of information overload <b>on</b> <b>screen</b> <b>display,</b> and the significance of user roles to tasks. The notion of a “cognitive archeology ” {{as a means to}} investigating task cognition will be explored and explained as a novel best practice in TA. “Cognitive archeology ” or the capture of cognitive processes required and utilized by users for task completion offers a necessary insight into the interchange of cognitive and task generated needs as they unfold at the design level. Concentrated analysis of explicit and implicit needs, decisionmaking processes, procedural knowledge, and motivation strategies creates a means for prioritization thereby improving interface effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. A computer controlled weld quality assurance system has been developed to detect weld defects ultrasonically whilst welding is in progress. This system, including a flash analogue to digital converter and built-in memories to store sampled data, a peak characters extractor and a welding process controller, enabled welding processes to be controlled automatically and welding defects to be detected concurrently with welding. In this way, the weld quality could be satisfactorily assured if no defect was detected and the welding cost was minimised either through avoiding similar defects to occur or by stopping the welding process if repair was necessary. This work demonstrated that the high temperature field around the weld pool was {{the major source of}} difficulties and unreliabilities in defect detection during welding and, had {{to be taken into account}} in welding control by ultrasonic means. The high temperatures not only influence ultrasonic characteristic parameters which are the defect judgement and assessment criterion, but also introduce noise into signals. The signal averaging technique and statistical analysis based on B-scan data have proved their feasibility to increase 'signal to noise ratio' effectively and to judge or assess weld defects. The hardware and the software for the system is explained in this work. By using this system, real-time 'A-scan' signals <b>on</b> <b>screen</b> <b>display,</b> and, A-scan, B-scan or three dimensional results can be printed on paper, or stored on disks, and, as a result, weld quality could be fully computerized.

40|$|The {{projector}} {{technology has}} continually developed {{to satisfy the}} consumer's needs in high quality. Base on the DLP (Digital Light Processing) technology proposed by TI, the OPTEA AB intends to introduce a graphic processor REON to its new projector VEO+. TI provides a complete DLP design supporting package DDP 2000 which includes DDP 2000 chip set, SDK and API for the third party device. This project is aimed to establish communication between the DDP 2000 system and the REON chip set, and then design a new GUI (graphic user interface) for the end user. After weeks ‟ document study, I found that the REON chip set is connected with DDP 2000 via I 2 C bus of DDP 2000. According to the discussion result from the meeting between OPTEA and Silicon Optix (The supplier of REON), I set the DDP 2000 system as the master device of the I 2 C bus. By using the I 2 C port functions from API of DDP 2000, I realized the communication between DDP 2000 and REON. The GUI {{was based on the}} original DDP 2000 GUI system OSD (<b>On</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>Display,</b> a GUI used in for the projector), which has 33 k lines of code. After digesting the large amount of code, I have modified the GUI relating to 8 k lines of code and I also added a button function to enable one REON function into the original OSD system for the end user. I 2 C/SPI/MDIO Protocol Analyzer had been used for the validation of the communication between DDP 2000 and REON by capturing all the data on the I 2 C bus. The results show all the data were sent to the right I 2 C addresses. To validate the improved OSD, we set operational tests to ensure that the output images are correct.

40|$|The {{following}} {{research focuses on}} the effect of measuring blast induced vibrations and the effect of the monitoring equipment and procedure on the outcomes. Mining and quarrying operations today are faced with ever increasing restrictions on their operations especially in the environmental field. Development applications for new operations have to contend with environmental issues such as dust, air pollutants, blast induced vibration and noise levels that at times restrict production outputs. Vibration monitoring has {{become an integral part of}} the mine/quarry operations and it is essential that the operators have confidence in the equipment that is used to measure these environmentally sensitive parameters. These issues were addressed in this thesis in both a laboratory investigation and a more practically oriented set of field trials. A standard technique used for measuring blast induced vibration levels was investigated and the error associated with the procedure was detailed. This standard technique was then compared to other commonly used mounting techniques. Some of these techniques have been accepted by the industry for many years basically because they are easy to carry out and do not require much time to set up. The errors encountered during this comparative trial were attributed to the poor bonding of the soil to the mounting device. This study was focused on the practicality aspect of vibration monitoring. The procedure recommended was found to have small random errors which were attributed to the complex nature of the vibration wave travelling through the ground. The laboratory investigation highlighted areas where care should be taken when bonding the mounting block to a soil type environment. Field trials were conducted in both surface and underground mining operations and a large range of vibration levels were used as the vibration sources for these trials. A n understanding of the vibration waveform and the importance of examining this waveform was discussed. The <b>on</b> <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> of all vibration monitoring equipment can give a misleading result as only the peak levels are displayed on the screen. What caused this peak level was examined. A special purpose laboratory vibration rig was designed and constructed to test some of the soil properties and their effect on the vibration wave transmission through the soil. The standard monitoring technique was used in the laboratory study to test properties such as moisture content of the soil, compaction of the soil in close proximity to the mounting block, type and size distribution of the soil. All of these soil properties had an effect on the vibration transmission through the soil and this effect was quantified. The fields trial phase of this study was mainly carried out at a local open cut coal mine. This coal mine site proved ideal as the frequency of the blasting operation allowed for a large number of trials to be carried out in a small period of time. Also the operations had variable explosive charge weights per delay and the distance from the blast to the monitoring location was regularly varied. In the field trial phase of this study the variability of the standard technique was investigated and the error level that could be expected was quantified. A comparison between typical mounting techniques and the standard technique quantified errors that could occur with these other methods. The density of the mounting block was also investigated with no significant change being measured for a large range of mount densities used. The investigation led to many conclusions and recommendations as follows: 1. The coupling or bonding of the soil to the monitoring equipment was found to be the most important factor. 2. A vibration monitoring procedure and equipment was recommended for soil monitoring applications. 3. The variation in the recommended procedure was measured and measurements within 1 0 % of each other were shown to be similar because of the nature of the vibration wave travelling through the ground. 4. Variations in industry accepted mounting procedures were shown to be quite significant with the recommended procedure having a sound scientific background. 5. Modern day electronics have made important advances in the equipment used to monitor blast induced vibrations and careful selection is recommended. 6. Analysis of the blast induced vibration waveform was shown to be critical as erroneous results can occur if instrument read outs are only used. 7. Vibration monitoring and subsequent modelling and prediction can play a useful role in establishing greenfield site vibration data...|$|E
