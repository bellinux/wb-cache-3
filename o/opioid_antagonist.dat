25|$|If {{laxatives}} are insufficiently effective (which {{is often}} the case), opioid formulations or regimens that include a peripherally-selective <b>opioid</b> <b>antagonist,</b> such as methylnaltrexone bromide, naloxegol, alvimopan, or naloxone (as in oxycodone/naloxone), may be tried. A 2008 Cochrane review found that the evidence was tentative for alvimopan, naloxone, or methylnaltrexone bromide.|$|E
50|$|While {{there have}} been no human studies of <b>opioid</b> <b>antagonists</b> for the {{treatment}} of excoriation disorder, {{there have been}} studies showing that these products can reduce self-chewing in dogs with acral lick, which some have proposed is a good animal model for the body-focused repetitive behavior. Furthermore, there have been case reports that support the use of these <b>opioid</b> <b>antagonists</b> to treat excoriation disorder. <b>Opioid</b> <b>antagonists</b> work by affecting dopamine circuitry, thereby decreasing the pleasurable effects of picking.|$|R

25|$|The Sinclair {{method is}} a method of using opiate antagonists such as {{naltrexone}} to treat alcoholism. The patient takes the medication about an hour (and only then) before drinking to avoid side effects that arise from chronic use. The <b>opioid</b> <b>antagonist</b> blocks the positive reinforcement effects of alcohol and allows the person to stop or reduce drinking.|$|E
25|$|Although {{nalbuphine}} possesses <b>opioid</b> <b>antagonist</b> activity, {{there is}} evidence that in nondependent patients it will not antagonize an opioid analgesic administered just before, concurrently, or just after an injection. Therefore, patients receiving an opioid analgesic, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, or other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with Nalbuphine may exhibit an additive effect. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{to other}} opiates, {{overdose}} by heroin alone is rather rare, and most reported overdoses occur either due to {{combination with other}} sedatives, such as benzodiazepines and ethanol, or after a person has been abstinent {{for some time and}} then uses. Their tolerance level will have decreased but user does not often account for time abstinent and overdoses or as a purposeful act of suicide. Heroin overdose is also reversible within minutes with administration of the <b>opioid</b> <b>antagonist</b> Naloxone.|$|E

25|$|Aside from antipsychotics, {{there is}} scant {{reliable}} research {{about the effectiveness}} or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. Results of the handful of randomized controlled trials that have been performed suggest that risperidone, the SSRI fluvoxamine, and the typical antipsychotic haloperidol may be effective in reducing some behaviors, that haloperidol {{may be more effective}} than the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine, and that the <b>opioid</b> <b>antagonist</b> naltrexone hydrochloride is not effective. In small studies, memantine has been shown to significantly improve language function and social behavior in children with autism. Research is underway on the effects of memantine in adults with autism spectrum disorders. A person with ASD may respond atypically to medications and the medications can have adverse side effects.|$|E
25|$|Opioid effects (adverse or otherwise) can be {{reversed}} with an <b>opioid</b> <b>antagonist</b> such as naloxone or naltrexone. These competitive antagonists bind to the opioid receptors with higher affinity than agonists {{but do not}} activate the receptors. This displaces the agonist, attenuating or reversing the agonist effects. However, the elimination half-life of naloxone can be shorter {{than that of the}} opioid itself, so repeat dosing or continuous infusion may be required, or a longer acting antagonist such as nalmefene may be used. In patients taking opioids regularly it is essential that the opioid is only partially reversed to avoid a severe and distressing reaction of waking in excruciating pain. This is achieved by not giving a full dose but giving this in small doses until the respiratory rate has improved. An infusion is then started to keep the reversal at that level, while maintaining pain relief. Opioid antagonists remain the standard treatment for respiratory depression following opioid overdose, with naloxone being by far the most commonly used, although the longer acting antagonist nalmefene may be used for treating overdoses of long-acting opioids such as methadone, and diprenorphine is used for reversing the effects of extremely potent opioids used in veterinary medicine such as etorphine and carfentanil. However, since opioid antagonists also block the beneficial effects of opioid analgesics, they are generally useful only for treating overdose, with use of opioid antagonists alongside opioid analgesics to reduce side effects, requiring careful dose titration and often being poorly effective at doses low enough to allow analgesia to be maintained.|$|E

2500|$|Schmidt et al. (1985) reviews nalbuphine’s pre-clinical {{pharmacology}} and report comparative data {{relative to other}} types of opioid compounds. [...] The authors {{point out that the}} nalbuphine moiety is approximately ten times more pharmacologically potent than the mixed opioid agonist-antagonist butorphanol on an “antagonist index” scale which quantitates the drug’s ability to act both as an analgesic (via opioid κ-receptor agonism) as well as an μ-receptor antagonist. [...] The <b>opioid</b> <b>antagonist</b> activity of Nalbuphine is one-fourth as potent as nalorphine and 10 times that of pentazocine.|$|E
2500|$|According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), {{patients}} stabilized on adequate, sustained {{doses of}} methadone or buprenorphine can keep their jobs, avoid crime and violence, and reduce {{their exposure to}} HIV and Hepatitis C by stopping or reducing injection drug use and drug-related high risk sexual behavior. Naltrexone is a long-acting <b>opioid</b> <b>antagonist</b> with few side effects. It is usually prescribed in outpatient medical conditions. [...] Naltrexone blocks the euphoric effects of alcohol and opiates. [...] Naltrexone cuts relapse risk during the first 3 months by about 36%. However, it is far less effective in helping patients maintain abstinence or retaining them in the drug-treatment system (retention rates average 12% at 90 days for naltrexone, average 57% at 90 days for buprenorphine, average 61% at 90 days for methadone).|$|E
2500|$|Some {{studies suggest}} {{acupuncture}} causes {{a series of}} events within the central nervous system, and {{that it is possible to}} inhibit acupuncture's analgesic effects with the <b>opioid</b> <b>antagonist</b> naloxone. Mechanical deformation of the skin by acupuncture needles appears to result in the release of adenosine. The anti-nociceptive effect of acupuncture may be mediated by the adenosine A1 receptor. A 2014 review in Nature Reviews Cancer found that since the key mouse studies that suggested acupuncture relieves pain via the local release of adenosine, which then triggered nearby A1 receptors [...] "caused more tissue damage and inflammation relative to the size of the animal in mice than in humans, such studies unnecessarily muddled a finding that local inflammation can result in the local release of adenosine with analgesic effect." ...|$|E

50|$|Authors of a {{previous}} paper in the Annals of Emergency Medicine surmised from the available evidence that the Moscow emergency services had not been informed {{of the use of}} the agent, but were instructed to bring <b>opioid</b> <b>antagonists.</b> Not knowing to expect hundreds of patients exposed to high doses of strong opioids, the emergency workers did not bring enough naloxone or naltrexone (the two most commonly-used <b>opioid</b> <b>antagonists)</b> to counteract the carfentanil and remifentanil and save the lives of many of the victims. 125 people exposed to the gas used in the rescue attempt are confirmed to have died from both respiratory failure and aerosol inhalation during the incident. The authors state that, assuming carfentanil and remifentanil were the only active ingredients of the knockout gas, that the worst danger to the theater victims would have been apnea (loss of breathing), and that mechanical ventilation and/or treatment with <b>opioid</b> <b>antagonists</b> could have saved many lives.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Numerous {{neurotransmitter}} systems [e. g. dopamine, y-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the endogenous opioids, and serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) ] {{are involved}} in the regulation of alcohol consumption. Because 5 -HT reuptalce inhibitors and <b>opioid</b> <b>antagonists</b> modify the activity of neurotransmitters, it has been hypothesized that they may also mediate the desire to drink alcohol by acting on specific receptors in the brain. Animal studies have shown that concomitant administration of 5 -HT and <b>opioid</b> <b>antagonists</b> reduces alcohol consumption; therefore, the combined use of several pharmacotherapies may be the most effective treatment for alcohol dependence...|$|R
