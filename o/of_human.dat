5|$|Approximately two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>human</b> serpins perform {{extracellular}} roles, inhibiting proteases in {{the bloodstream}} in order to modulate their activities. For example, extracellular serpins regulate the proteolytic cascades central to blood clotting (antithrombin), the inflammatory and immune responses (antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, and C1-inhibitor) and tissue remodelling (PAI-1). By inhibiting signalling cascade proteases, they can also affect development. The table <b>of</b> <b>human</b> serpins (below) provides examples {{of the range of}} functions performed by human serpin, {{as well as some of}} the diseases that result from serpin deficiency.|$|E

5|$|Gould was a {{champion}} of biological constraints, internal limitations upon developmental pathways, {{as well as other}} non-selectionist forces in evolution.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} what view <b>of</b> <b>humans</b> that emerges when priests/reverends talk about man in relation to baptism. The study consists of qualitative interviews with four priests/reverends. There were two representatives from the church of Sweden, and two from the Pentecostal church. The aim and questions in the study focus on what view <b>of</b> <b>humans</b> that emerges. Will there be similarities and differences in the view <b>of</b> <b>humans,</b> and is it possible to refer the result to the respective church. The theory that is being used focusses on so called components <b>of</b> how <b>humans</b> are viewed and these components can be seen as building blocks in how a view <b>of</b> <b>humans</b> is formed. The background comes from the varying view of the baptism tradition that exists in Christianity. The church of Sweden mainly baptizes children, whereas the Pentecostal church practices believer´s baptism. The result demonstrates that the reflected view <b>of</b> <b>humans</b> in different ways can prove what each church of the interviewee represents...|$|R
