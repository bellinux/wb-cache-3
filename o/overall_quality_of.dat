5|$|SCI is {{extremely}} disruptive to sexuality, and it most frequently happens to young people, {{who are at}} a peak in their sexual and reproductive lives. Yet the importance of sexuality {{as a part of}} life is not diminished by a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual, research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most paraplegics rated sexual function as their top priority, and most tetraplegics rated it second, after hand and arm function. Sexual function has a profound impact on self-esteem and adjustment to life post-injury.

40|$|The spatial <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> {{automotive}} audio {{systems is}} often compromised {{due to their}} unideal listening environments. Automotive audio systems {{need to be developed}} quickly due to industry demands. A suitable perceptual model could evaluate the spatial <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> automotive audio systems with similar reliability to formal listening tests but take less time. Such a model is developed in this research project by adapting an existing model <b>of</b> spatial <b>quality</b> for automotive audio use. The requirements for the adaptation were investigated in a literature review. A perceptual model called QESTRAL was reviewed, which predicts the <b>overall</b> spatial <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> domestic multichannel audio systems. It was determined that automotive audio systems are likely to be impaired in terms of the spatial attributes that were not considered in developing the QESTRAL model, but metrics are available that might predict these attributes. To establish whether the QESTRAL model in its current form can accurately predict the <b>overall</b> spatial <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> automotive audio systems, MUSHRA listening tests using headphone auralisation with head tracking were conducted to collect results to be compared against predictions by the model. Based on guideline criteria, the model in its current form could not accurately predict the <b>overall</b> spatial <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> automotive audio systems. To improve prediction performance, the QESTRAL model was recalibrated and modified using existing metrics of the model, those that were proposed from the literature review, and newly developed metrics. The most important metrics for predicting the <b>overall</b> spatial <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> automotive audio systems included those that were interaural cross-correlation (IACC) based, relate to localisation of the frontal audio scene, and account for the perceived scene width in front of the listener. Modifying the model for automotive audio systems did not invalidate its use for domestic audio systems. The resulting model predicts the <b>overall</b> spatial <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> 2 - and 5 -channel automotive audio systems with a cross-validation performance of R^ 2 = 0. 85 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 11. 03...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{research on}} ontologies for representing requirements models (and metamodels), little {{progress has been}} made in using ontologies to represent non-functional requirements. Non-functional requirements define the <b>overall</b> <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> the resulting system. Because they are restrictions on system services, non-functional requirements are often of critical importance, and functional requirements may need to be sacrificed to meet them. However, because of their diverse nature, non-functional requirements are often expressed in non-standard domain-specific ways.
