5|$|The naturalism {{of natural}} {{selection}} conflicted with presumptions of purpose in nature and while this could be reconciled by theistic evolution, other mechanisms implying more progress or purpose were more acceptable. Herbert Spencer had already incorporated Lamarckism into his popular philosophy of progressive free market human society. He popularised the terms evolution and survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fittest,</b> and many thought Spencer was central to evolutionary thinking.|$|E
5|$|Joust 2: Survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fittest</b> is an arcade game {{developed}} by Williams Electronics and released in 1986. It is {{a sequel to}} Williams' 1982 game Joust. Like its predecessor, Joust 2 is a 2D aerial combat game with platforms to land on. The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards. Joust 2 features improved audio-visuals and new features such as mutant buzzards created by eggs falling into lava, the ability to transform from an ostrich to a flying horse, and differently themed levels. Waves no longer seamlessly flow into each other; the gameplay is divided into separate screens with transitions between them.|$|E
5|$|The one Germanic-language {{speaking}} {{country that}} {{was not included in}} the Pan-Germanic unification aim was the United Kingdom, in spite of its near-universal acceptance by the Nazi government as being part of the Germanic world. Leading Nordic ideologist Hans F. K. Günther theorized that the Anglo-Saxons had been more successful than the Germans in maintaining racial purity and that the coastal and island areas of Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall and Wales had received additional Nordic blood through Norse raids and colonization during the Viking Age, and the Anglo-Saxons of East Anglia and Northern England had been under Danish rule in the 9th and 10th centuries. Günther referred to this historical process as Aufnordung ("additional nordification"), which finally culminated in the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Britain was thus a nation created by struggle and the survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fittest</b> among the various Aryan peoples of the isles, and was able to pursue global conquest and empire-building because of its superior racial heredity born through this development.|$|E

5|$|They {{dropped the}} tag team {{title to the}} CM Punk and Colt Cabana at ROH's Chicago-area debut, ROH Reborn: Stage Two, working in ROH {{for the first time}} as outward heels. At the next show, Round Robin Challenge III, the title {{switched}} three times among the teams in the round robin challenge, the Second City Saints (Punk and Cabana), the Briscoe Brothers, and the Prophecy team of Dan Maff and B.J. Whitmer. The Briscoes defeated Maff and Whitmer in the fourth match of the night to win the title for a second time, and then lost it back to Punk and Cabana in the main event. The Brothers both participated in ROH's inaugural Survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fittest</b> tournament, with Mark going over Alex Shelley in his qualifier and Jay falling to Homicide. Mark did not, however, win the elimination final. After losing a two out of three falls tag team title match to Punk and Cabana at Death Before Dishonor II Part 1, ending that feud, they lost in separate singles matches to members of The Rottweilers the next night. Between that and their victory in tag team action at Testing the Limit, it is likely that a feud was planned between the Briscoes and the Rottweilers.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{selection}} is commonly equated with survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fittest,</b> but this expression originated in Herbert Spencer's Principles of Biology in 1864, {{five years after}} Charles Darwin published his original works.

These connections become visible whenever balance calibration data is supplied in its design format {{and both the}} Iterative and Non-Iterative Method are used to process the data. First, it is shown how <b>the</b> regression coefficients <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fitted</b> balance loads <b>of</b> a force balance can {{be approximated by using}} the corresponding regression coefficients <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fitted</b> strain-gage outputs.

40|$|In {{order to}} provide {{discrimination}} between the $Wt$ channel signal and its backgrounds for analyses that try to measure single top-quark production in the $Wt$ channel, a kinematic <b>fit</b> to <b>the</b> lepton+jets decay mode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> $Wt$ channel has been implemented using the KLFitter package. <b>The</b> <b>fit</b> has been validated by studying its performance in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fit</b> to correctly assign <b>the</b> final-state quarks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fit</b> model to <b>the</b> measured jets {{as a function of}} various parameters, as well as <b>the</b> improvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy resolutions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fitted</b> particles due to <b>the</b> <b>fit.</b> By combining <b>the</b> output variables <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kinematic <b>fitter</b> using neural networks, {{it has been shown that}} <b>the</b> <b>fit</b> results are suitable to identify <b>the</b> decay mode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top quark in $Wt$ events and to identify whether <b>the</b> kinematic <b>fit</b> succeeded in correctly assigning the final-state quarks to the measured jets.

He believed that reforms made by Peter the Great and Emperor Meiji were excellent examples of the political restructuring that needed to take place to save China. From Kang's work, Phan realized why Emperor Tự Đức's decision to ignore Nguyễn Trường Tộ's proposed modernization reforms had led to the downfall of Vietnam and had allowed for French rule in Vietnam.|$|E

It was later revealed Danielson had become frustrated in general with professional wrestling and planned {{to take some time}} off to evaluate his career options. Danielson had several dates booked in Europe and Japan, however, leading fans to believe that the periodical was likely a storyline claim for Danielson's absence during this period. In May 2005, rumors started that Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) was interested in signing Danielson, and he also had some more tryout matches with WWE at that time, but none of these events led to anything and he remained in ROH.|$|E

At the October 2 Ring of Honor Wrestling tapings they defeated the team of Grizzly Redwood and Mike Sydal. They lost to Steve Corino and Kevin Steen on October 15, and the All Night Express of Kenny King and Rhett Titus at a show on October 16. They defeated the Bravado Brothers (Lance and Harlem) on the November 8 episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling. On November 12, O'Reilly participated in the 2010 edition of the Survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fittest</b> tournament, but was eliminated by Kevin Steen in the first round. The following night in Toronto, O'Reilly and Cole defeated the Bravado Brothers. O'Reilly made his ROH pay-per-view debut on December 18 at Final Battle 2010, where he and Cole were defeated by the All Night Express (Rhett Titus and Kenny King). On April 1 and 2 at Chapter One and Two of Honor Takes Center Stage, O'Reilly and Cole faced The Briscoe Brothers (Jay and Mark) and The Kings of Wrestling (Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli) in two losing efforts, despite putting on strong performances. On July 8, O'Reilly and Cole defeated the Bravado Brothers to earn a future shot at the ROH World Tag Team Championship. On July 25, ROH announced that O'Reilly had re-signed with the promotion. At the August 13 tapings of Ring of Honor Wrestling, the tag team of O'Reilly and Cole was named Future Shock.|$|E

500|$|For Darwin and his contemporaries, natural {{selection}} was in essence synonymous with evolution by {{natural selection}}. After {{the publication of}} On the Origin of Species, educated people generally accepted that evolution had occurred in some form. However, natural selection remained controversial as a mechanism, partly because it was perceived to be too weak to explain the range of observed characteristics of living organisms, and partly because even supporters of evolution balked at its [...] "unguided" [...] and non-progressive nature, a response that has been characterised as the single most significant impediment to the idea's acceptance. However, some thinkers enthusiastically embraced natural selection; after reading Darwin, Herbert Spencer introduced the phrase survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fittest,</b> which became a popular summary of the theory. The fifth edition of On the Origin of Species published in 1869 included Spencer's phrase {{as an alternative to}} natural selection, with credit given: [...] "But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fittest</b> is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient." [...] Although the phrase is still often used by non-biologists, modern biologists avoid it because it is tautological if [...] "fittest" [...] is read to mean [...] "functionally superior" [...] and is applied to individuals rather than considered as an averaged quantity over populations.|$|E
