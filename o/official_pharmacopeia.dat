40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} work was to obtain directly compressible enteric recrystallized agglomerates of erythromycin containing enteric polymers by emulsion solvent diffusion technique. Selected solvent for the process includes the best solvent (ethyl alcohol), non-solvent (distilled water) and bridging liquid (chloroform) according to their solubility in different organic solvent. The different enteric coating polymers like cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), Eudragit S 100 and Eudragit L 100 {{were used in the}} crystallization system. The impact of these enteric coating polymers in drug: polymer ratio 1 : 0. 25 and 1 : 0. 5 on the release of erythromycin in 0. 1 N HCl were studied. The other physicochemical properties like flowability and packability were also studied. There is significant improvement in flowability and packability of enteric recrystallized agglomerates as compared to the raw crystals of erythromycin. The enteric recrystallized agglomerates having drug: polymer ratio 1 : 0. 5 shows below 10 % release of erythromycin in 0. 1 N HCl therefore selected for tablet preparation. The directly compressed tablets of these optimized enteric recrystallized agglomerates were prepared with microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel pH 102) and lactose monohydrate (Flowlac 200) as diluents. These prepared tablets shows below 10 % release of erythromycin in 0. 1 N HCl and above 80 % in phosphate buffer pH 6. 8 which indicate that these tablets complies the release pattern as per the <b>official</b> <b>pharmacopeia...</b>|$|E
40|$|The recent {{appreciation}} of phytotherapy {{is related to}} the evidence of efficacy of herbal medicines, {{as well as to the}} continuous improvement of scientific and clinical knowledge of their effects. Unfortunately among herbal medicine it is frequent to find products that are neither registered nor controlled by regulatory bodies, with a lack of proofs regarding their constituents and quality. Phytotherapy can find its role among medical therapies only if each medication is standardised and controlled according to the requirements of an official Pharmacopoeia, and produced on the basis of Good Manufacturing Practices similar to those used in pharmaceutical companies. This is even more important in paediatric age, also because often parents administer herbal medications to their children, without asking the physician or the pharmacist for advice, being convinced that “natural products” are always safe and do not have adverse events or interactions. The evaluation of these products, ensuring their safety and efficacy through registration and regulation, is an important challenge. To improve an evidence-based and safe use, herbal medicines should be titrated, standardised and labelled. Clinical applications, pharmacology, dosage, possible contraindications and precautions (i. e. during pregnancy, breastfeeding and paediatric age), and potential adverse reactions should be clearly described and codified, for example in the <b>official</b> <b>Pharmacopeia</b> and in the various Monographs (ESCOP, The European Scientific Cooperative On Phytotherapy, and WHO, World Health Organization). The purpose of this article is to provide a review on the safety and efficacy of some medicinal plants widely used in the paediatric age: echinacea, cranberry, and chamomile.

40|$|Psoriasis vulgaris is {{a common}} skin {{disorder}} characterized by focal formation of inflamed, raised plaques that constantly shed scales derived from excessive growth of skin epithelial cells. Prevalence of Psoriasis is 2 - 3 % in general population. Currently, Topical Corticosteroids remain a pivotal treatment due to their effective anti-inflammatory properties; however potential adverse effects associated with chronic application limit long-term continuous therapy. Vitamin D analogues provide another mechanism of action reducing lesions through effects on keratinocytes and on cytokine environment. A topical combination of corticosteroid & Vitamin D derivative appears to provide a balanced approach to psoriasis treatment. When Calcitriol is used in combination with topical steroids, some improvement in psoriasis treatment was observed. The main side effect of Calcitriol is skin irritation. Topical steroids Clobetasol {{used in conjunction with}} Calcitriol may lessen skin irritation. Combination reduces hazards associated with long term use of topical Corticosteroids (atrophy and rebound) as well as irritation associated with Calcipotriol.

40|$|Ever since {{cannabis}} pharmaceuticals {{were removed}} from <b>official</b> <b>pharmacopeias</b> in the Western world in the mid-twentieth century there have been ongoing campaigns to re-legalise medicinal cannabis. This political and social struggle for legalisation tends to be cyclical, with its proponents and detractors fluctuating between characterising its use {{as a form of}} deviance through to viewing it as a legitimate response to serious medical conditions. This thesis poses the research question, ‘Is there a case for reform of the law to allow for the use of cannabis for medicinal purpose in New South Wales?’ The thesis is written for the thousands of seriously ill people who could benefit greatly from medicinal cannabis if it were legal and available. It addresses the what, who, how and why of the topic, only omitting ‘when’ which is a function of political timing {{beyond the scope of this}} study. Throughout it utilises forms of risk/benefit analysis, mindful of the potential hazards of the drug while being cognisant of its unique properties. It is designed to function as an evidentiary base for use by health care advocates, activists and reformist politicians seeking to raise the issue of medicinal cannabis with a view to initiating legislation, initially in the state of New South Wales and subsequently in all Australian states and territories. Adopting a multi-disciplinary triangulated methodology, the thesis sets out to assess the evidence for medicinal cannabis legalisation. This includes a narrative of my own experiences with Parkinsons disease, the jurisprudential and criminological issues raised, whether there is sufficient evidence of the efficacy of medicinal cannabis to warrant its legalisation and whether there is a large enough constituency of potential medicinal cannabis users to render legalisation politically feasible. After examining the history of medicinal cannabis use both overseas and in Australia, the study examines overseas and Australian legislation and case law, dissects three case studies explaining some pitfalls of drug research, a legal defence for medicinal cannabis arrestees and an ethical and safer source of medicinal cannabis.

40|$|Section 505 (d) of the Act {{requires}} “substantial evidence ” {{of effectiveness}} before a drug {{can be placed}} on the market and sold to consumers. In most instances, the Agency has interpreted this to mean that a drug manufacturer must provide adequate and well-controlled clinical studies distinguishing a drug’s effectiveness “from other influences, such as spontaneous change {{in the course of the}} disease, placebo effect, or biased observation. ” 21 C. F. R. § 314. 126. The Act’s language makes clear that homeopathic drugs fall under the definition of the term “drug ” as used broadly in the Act. Section 201 (g) (1) of the Act defines the term “drug ” as used in the Act to include “articles recognized in the <b>official</b> United States <b>Pharmacopeia</b> [“USP”], the <b>official</b> Homeopathic <b>Pharmacopeia</b> of the United States [“HPUS”], or official National Formulary [“NF”], or any supplement to them; and articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or the prevention of disease in man or other animals; articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals; and articles intended for use as a component of any articles ” so specified. Whether or not they are official homeopathic remedies, those products offered for the cure, mitigation, prevention, or treatment of disease conditions are regarded as drugs within the meaning of Section 201 (g) (l) of the Act. Section 400. 400 of the FDA Compliance Policy Guidelines, “Conditions Under Which Homeopathic Drugs May be Marketed, ” states that a product’s “compliance with requirements of the HPUS, USP, or NF does not establish that it has been shown by appropriate means to be safe, effective, and not misbranded for its intended use. ” The plain meaning of the Act therefore permits the Agency to subject OTC homeopathic drugs to the same effectiveness standards that apply to other OTC drugs.

Additionally, according to the Anvisa resolution RDC 31 / 2010, the dissolution profile of the drug must be tested and compared with that of the branded reference, as a benchmark of quality. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the quality of 500 mg sodium metamizole (dipyrone) tablets produced by seven different laboratories in Brazil: three generic drugs (G 1, G 2, G 3), three (branded) similar drugs (S 1, S 2,S 3) and their reference branded product (Novalgina®, Sanofi-Aventis, drug R). All tests were carried out by methods specified in the Brazilian Pharmacopeia 4 th edition (Farmacopeia Brasileira IV). The following tests were performed: uniformity of mass, friability, disintegration time, hardness, assay, uniformity of dosage units, salicylic acid limit assay, dissolution and identification. The dissolution profile was also recorded, as recommended in RDC 31 / 2010. Whereas every sample was approved in all the Farmacopeia Brasileira IV tests, the results in the dissolution profile test showed that four of the test drugs (G 1, G 2, S 1 and S 2) were notpharmaceutically equivalent to drug R. Thus, only drugs G 3 and S 3 showed dissolution profiles similar to that of drug R and the other four drugs could not be considered equivalent to it and were not approved...|$|R
