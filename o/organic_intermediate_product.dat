40|$|International audienceA {{combined}} process coupling an electro-Fenton pretreatment and {{a biological}} degradation was implemented {{in order to}} mineralize synthetic and industrial pharmaceutical effluents, containing a veterinary antibiotic, sulfamethazine (SMT). The electro-Fenton pretreatment of SMT synthetic solution was first examined and the obtained results showed total SMT degradation after 30 min of electrolysis at pH 3, 18 °C, 500 mA and an initial SMT concentration of 0. 2 mM, while the level of mineralization remained low (2. 1 and 18. 1 % for 30 and 60 min electrolysis times), ensuring significant residual organic content for a subsequent biological treatment. In a second part, biological treatments were performed to complete the mineralization of the electrolyzed solutions of SMT, showing a significant level of mineralization after about 18 days of culture, 61. 4 % for 30 min pretreatment. The same electrolysis conditions were then applied to the pretreatment of an industrial pharmaceutical effluent, showing a total SMT removal in the effluent after 100 min of electrolysis, while mineralization yield remained also low (7. 5 %), showing the formation of <b>organic</b> <b>intermediate</b> <b>products.</b> Fortunately, the mineralization yield during the subsequent biological treatment increased to almost 80 %, namely an overall yield of 81. 4 %. Consequently, the integrated electro-Fenton–biological treatment process {{proved to be an}} efficient technology to remediate industrial pharmaceutical effluents...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{bench scale}} system {{integrated}} with a non-thermal plasma (NTP) and a biotricking filtration (BTF) unit {{for the treatment}} of gases containing dimethyl sulfide (DMS) was investigated. DMS removal efficiency in the integrated system was up to 96 %. Bacterial communities in the BTF were assessed by PCR–DGGE, which play the dominant role in the biological processes of metabolism, sulfur oxidation, sulfate-reducing and carbon oxidation. The addition of ozone from NTP made microbial community in BTF more complicated and active for DMS removal. The NTP oxidize DMS to simple compounds such as methanol and carbonyl sulfide; the <b>intermediate</b> <b>organic</b> <b>products</b> and DMS are further oxidized to sulfate, carbon dioxide, water vapors by biological degradation. These results show that NTP–BTF is achievable and open new possibilities for applying the integrated with NTP and BTF to odour gas treatment...|$|R

40|$|A {{simplified}} {{kinetic model}} {{for studying the}} anaerobic digestion of wastewater derived from the pressing of orange rind {{as a result of}} orange juice production was proposed {{on the basis of the}} experimental results obtained. The process was conducted in a laboratory-scale completely stirred tank reactor operating in batch mode at mesophilic temperature (35 °C), with COD loads in the range of 2 – 5 g COD. The following simplified three-step reaction scheme was proposed: (1) hydrolysis and conversion of complex <b>organic</b> compounds into <b>intermediate</b> <b>products</b> of lower molecular weight; (2) conversion of these intermediates to volatile fatty acids (VFA); and (3) methanization of the VFA by methanogenic microorganisms. A mathematical model based on four segregated differential equations was formulated assuming that a fraction of this substrate is non-biodegradable and the above-mentioned steps follow first-order kinetics. It was found that the kinetic constants corresponding to these three stages (K 0, K 1 and K 2) decreased markedly with the load added to the reactor, showing the occurrence of an inhibition process. In addition, it was observed that the methanogenic step was the slowest in the overall anaerobic process. Finally, the model was validated by comparing the theoretical curves obtained with the corresponding experimental data of organic matter, VFA and methane. The deviations obtained (less than 20 %) in most cases demonstrated the suitability of the mathematical model proposed and suggested that the parameters obtained represent and predict the activity of the microorganisms involved in the anaerobic digestion process of this wastewate...|$|R
