5|$|Brucie's win in 1940 {{coincided with}} the American Cocker Spaniel {{becoming}} the most popular breed of dog in the United States, and they would remain the most popular until 1952. The most recent victory was in 1954 with the victory going to Ch. Carmor's Rise and Shine.

5|$|The rivalry {{had been}} less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals {{for the first time}} since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series 4–2.

5|$|At first, {{the balance}} of power {{appeared}} to move slightly in Matilda's favour. Robert of Gloucester besieged Stephen in 1143 at Wilton Castle, an assembly point for royal forces in Herefordshire. Stephen attempted to break out and escape, resulting in the Battle of Wilton. Once again, the Angevin cavalry proved too strong, and for a moment it appeared that Stephen might be captured for a second time, before finally managing to escape. Later in the year Geoffrey de Mandeville, the Earl of Essex, rose up in rebellion against Stephen in East Anglia. Geoffrey based himself from the Isle of Ely and began a military campaign against Cambridge, with the intention of progressing south towards London. Ranulf of Chester revolted <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1144.|$|E
5|$|At the 2007 World Championships, Lysacek {{made his}} first attempt at landing a quadruple jump in the short program.

He placed fifth in the short program and earned himself his first new short program personal best in two years. In the long program, he completed a quadruple toe-loop as the first part of a quad-triple combination, but lost control of the landing, adding a three turn after it, and was unable to complete the following triple as intended. He performed a double loop instead of a planned triple loop and placed fifth <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long program, placing fifth over all.|$|E

5|$|Davenport {{experienced}} {{an economic and}} building boom in the 1920s and early 1930s. The Kahl Building and the Capitol Theatre, the baseball stadium, the Parker Building, and the Blackhawk Hotel {{are a few of}} the buildings built during this time period that are still standing. The Great Depression brought economic tough times to the city. The inclusion of new factories in the 1940s and 1950s helped turn the economy around after World War II. Davenport was on hard times once again with the farm crisis of the 1980s, when the Caterpillar Plant closed, costing 35,000 jobs. The city was rejuvenated <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s and present by renovations and building additions.|$|E
5|$|Despite the club's Grand Final defeat, Harley {{collected}} {{a range of}} individual accolades following his performances throughout the season. He earned his first All-Australian honour and was named as vice-captain of the team. Harley was also recognised by the AFLPA, as {{he was awarded the}} AFLPA Best Captain award in just his second season at the helm. After setting career-highs of 209 handballs and 378 disposals during the season, Harley was awarded a career-high seven Brownlow Medal votes during the count and named <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South Australian State of Origin team.

On 9 February, Drogba lost 4–2 to hosts Ghana and thus ended their run in the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The 2003 Trojans {{finished}} {{the season with}} a 12–1 record and shared the national title with the Louisiana State University (LSU) Tigers; USC won the Associated Press championship while LSU played for and won the BCS National Championship. The 2004 Trojans finished with a 13–0 record that included a win in the national championship game. The team became only the second team to be ranked first in the AP Poll from pre-season {{until the end of the}} season, and the tenth team to repeat as national champions. Returning fourteen starters from 2004, including Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Matt Leinart, and with a 22-game winning streak, the Trojans were ranked at the top of the polls <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pre-season.|$|E
5|$|The Harrietstown–Gabriels highway {{became a}} signed route <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1950s {{when it became}} NY192A. Both NY192 and NY192A {{remained}} unchanged through the late 1970s. On January7, 1980, NY192A was supplanted by a realigned NY192. Maintenance of NY192's former routing between Gabriels and Bloomingdale {{was transferred to the}} counties it ran through—namely Franklin and Essex—in stages. The Franklin County portion was given to the county on April1, 1980, while the section in Essex County was transferred to county control on April1, 1985, as part of highway maintenance swaps between the state of New York and Franklin and Essex counties. On March28, 1989, NY192 was supplanted by a realigned NY86.|$|E

5|$|The {{teaching}} of evolution in American secondary school biology classes was uncommon {{in most of}} the first half of the 20th century. The Scopes Trial decision of 1925 caused the subject to become very rare in American secondary biology textbooks for a generation, but it was gradually re-introduced later and became legally protected with the 1968 Epperson v. Arkansas decision. Since then, the competing religious belief of creationism was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s, but it returned in pseudoscientific form as intelligent design (ID), to be excluded <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2005 Kitzmiller v.

5|$|As {{the train}} departs towards King's Cross, Rubeus Hagrid waves riders goodbye {{outside of the}} window. Shadows of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger can also been seen walking down the train corridor, looking for an empty compartment. Following this, Buckbeak flies outside the window, while Hogwarts {{can be seen in}} the background. Shortly after, the train enters a forest where centaurs are running. Upon exiting the forest, Hogwarts can be seen <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background. Fred and George Weasley appear, flying broomsticks and playing with fireworks. The Hogwarts Express then enters a tunnel, after which riders find {{themselves}} in the middle of a storm and pass Malfoy Manor. The journey then enters a second tunnel; Harry, Ron, and Hermione appear again in the train corridor. As a spider crawls up the compartment door, Ron eats it and the trio continue to walk on down the corridor. After the tunnel the journey continues into London passing by an industrial factory and then a residential area. The Knight Bus then appears; squeezing between buildings and shrinking to pass under a bridge. As the bus drives away, the train enters King's Cross station, where Alastor Moody greets passengers.|$|E
5|$|For a period, the {{situation}} continued to worsen. Ranulf of Chester revolted <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1144, splitting up Stephen's Honour of Lancaster {{between himself and}} Prince Henry. In the west, Robert of Gloucester and his followers continued to raid the surrounding royalist territories, and Wallingford Castle remained a secure Angevin stronghold, too close to London for comfort. Meanwhile, Geoffrey of Anjou finished securing his hold on southern Normandy and in January 1144 he advanced into Rouen, {{the capital of the}} duchy, concluding his campaign. Louis VII recognised him as Duke of Normandy shortly after. By this point in the war, Stephen was depending increasingly on his immediate royal household, such as William of Ypres and others, and lacked the support of the major barons who {{might have been able to}} provide him with significant additional forces; after the events of 1141, Stephen made little use of his network of earls.|$|E
