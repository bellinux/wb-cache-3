2500|$|A {{month in}} advance of the 2011 World Cup in March, Sangakkara decided that he would resign the {{captaincy}} after the tournament. Sri Lanka reached the final of the tournament. Throughout the tournament Sangakkara was in prolific form with the bat scoring 465 runs from 9 matches and was the third highest run-scorer behind team-mate Tillakaratne Dilshan and India's Sachin Tendulkar. Days after guiding Sri Lanka to the finals of the World Cup, Sangakkara announced to the public he was stepping down as captain of the T20 and ODI teams. He offered to continue as Test captain if deemed necessary for transition to new skipper, but Dilshan was appointed captain across all formats. Reflecting on the decision afterwards, he said that [...] "captaining Sri Lanka is a job that ages you very quickly... It's rarely a job you will last long in... I also had a two-year stint, and I enjoyed it at times, certainly on the field where <b>our</b> <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> we were one of the top two sides in the world for one-and-a-half years, especially in the shorter form of the game." ...|$|E
