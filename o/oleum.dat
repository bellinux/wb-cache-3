5|$|The {{volatile}} oil, <b>oleum</b> cubebae, was {{the form}} in which cubeb is most commonly used as a drug, the dose being 5 to 20 minims, which may be suspended in mucilage or given after meals in a wafer. The drug exhibited the typical actions of a volatile oil, but exerted some of these to an exceptional degree. As such, it was liable to cause a cutaneous erythema {{in the course of}} its excretion by the skin, had a marked diuretic action, and was a fairly efficient disinfectant of the urinary passages. Its administration caused the appearance in the urine of a salt of cubebic acid which was precipitated by heat or nitric acid, and was therefore liable to be mistaken for albumin, when these two most common tests for the occurrence of albuminuria were applied.|$|E

500|$|Its {{most stable}} form, the grey {{trigonal}} allotrope, {{is sometimes called}} [...] "metallic" [...] selenium because its electrical conductivity is several orders of magnitude {{greater than that of}} the red monoclinic form. The metallic character of selenium is further shown by its lustre, and its crystalline structure, which is thought to include weakly [...] "metallic" [...] interchain bonding. Selenium can be drawn into thin threads when molten and viscous. It shows reluctance to acquire [...] "the high positive oxidation numbers characteristic of nonmetals". It can form cyclic polycations (such as Se) when dissolved in <b>oleums</b> (an attribute it shares with sulfur and tellurium), and a hydrolysed cationic salt in the form of trihydroxoselenium (IV) perchlorate +·ClO.|$|R
40|$|With their {{potentially}} extraordinary mechanical, thermal, {{and electrical}} properties, Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWNT) /polymer composites and composite fibers {{may be the}} ultimate building blocks for next generation ultra-light-weight, ultra-high performance structural applications. However, the dispersity and processibility of SWNT in polymer matrices have been a challenge because of the strong van der Waal attraction between individual nanotubes and their chemical inertness. Predicated on <b>oleum's</b> (100 % H 2 SO 4 with excess SO 3) ability to intercalate between individual SWNT inside SWNT ropes, two types of reinforcing SWNT with much improved solubility and dispersity in common solvents were developed: supra-roped SWNT (SWNT-R) and soluble, ultra-short (length< 60 nm), carboxylated SWNT(US-SWNT). SWNT-R hold much improved dispersity in super acid and other solvents, and can facilitate the processing of SWNT/polylmer composites and composites fibers. US-SWNT exhibit up to 2 wt% solubility in common solvents. The availability of SWNT-R and US-SWNT open the opportunities for forming high performance composites, blends, and copolymers without inhibiting their processibility. Studies on the synthesis, processing, properties, and morphology of SWNT-R or US-SWNT/polymer composites and composite fibers have demonstrated the reinforcement efficacy of these SWNT in typical thermoset, thermoplastic and liquid crystalline polymer matrices. The epoxy composite system reinforced with 0. 5 [...] 1 wt% of US-SWNT has shown an average 15 % increase in tensile modulus and 50 % increase in tensile toughness over those of the neat epoxy. A linear rule-of-mixture calculation indicates the high reinforcement efficiency of US-SWNT in epoxy matrix. The calculated SWNT's elastic modulus approaches the theoretical value. This processible and high performance US-SWNT/Epoxy resin {{may serve as a}} matrix material for advanced fiber composites. A novel solution-processing method was introduced to achieve good dispersion of SWNT-R or US-SWNT in Nylon (6, 6) matrix. In comparison to neat resin, increase in tensile modulus and glass transition temperature were observed with 5 wt% nanotubes incorporation. However, the tensile toughness was significant decreased. An advanced SWNT-R/US-SWNT poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide(PPTA) composite fiber system was developed to realize the ultimate SWNT properties and make them processible by conventional fiber spinning processes...|$|R

25|$|At the time, {{formic acid}} {{was formed by}} the {{distillation}} of dead ants, and Döbereiner's ant bodies probably contained some plant matter. In 1840, the Scottish chemist John Stenhouse found that the same chemical could be produced by distilling {{a wide variety of}} crop materials, including corn, oats, bran, and sawdust, with aqueous sulfuric acid; he also determined an empirical formula of (C5H4O2). George Fownes named this oil furfurol in 1845 (from furfur - bran, and <b>oleum).</b> This name persisted prominently in the literature until 1901 when the German chemist Carl Harries deduced furfural's structure.|$|E
500|$|The modern use of cubeb in England {{as a drug}} {{dates from}} 1815. There were various preparations, {{including}} <b>oleum</b> cubebae (oil of cubeb), tinctures, fluid extracts, oleo-resin compounds, and vapors, which were used for throat complaints. A small percentage of cubeb was commonly included in lozenges designed to alleviate bronchitis, in which the antiseptic and expectoral properties of the drug are useful. The most important therapeutic application of this drug, however, was in treating gonorrhea, where its antiseptic action was of much value. William Wyatt Squire wrote in 1908 that cubebs [...] "act specifically on the genito-urinary mucous membrane. (They are) given in all stages of gonorrhea". As compared with copaiba in this connection cubeb has the advantages of being less disagreeable to take and somewhat less likely to disturb the digestive apparatus in prolonged administration.|$|E

[...] Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim (1493–1541), better known as Paracelsus, discovered the analgesic properties of diethyl ether around 1525. It was first synthesized in 1540 by Valerius Cordus, who noted some of its medicinal properties. He called it <b>oleum</b> dulce vitrioli, a name that {{reflects the fact that}} it is synthesized by distilling a mixture of ethanol and sulfuric acid (known at that time as oil of vitriol). August Sigmund Frobenius gave the name Spiritus Vini Æthereus to the substance in 1730.|$|E
2500|$|Although bulk {{fluorite}} is {{a suitable}} precursor {{and a major}} source of world HF production, HF is also produced as a by-product of the production of phosphoric acid, which is derived from the mineral apatite. Apatite sources typically contain a few percent of fluoroapatite, acid digestion of which releases a gaseous stream consisting of sulfur dioxide (from the H2SO4), water, and HF, as well as particulates. [...] After separation from the solids, the gases are treated with sulfuric acid and <b>oleum</b> to afford anhydrous HF. [...] Owing to the corrosive nature of HF, its production is accompanied by the dissolution of silicate minerals, and, in this way, significant amounts of fluorosilicic acid are generated.|$|E
2500|$|In industry, TNT is {{produced}} in a three-step process. First, toluene is nitrated {{with a mixture of}} sulfuric and nitric acid to produce mononitrotoluene (MNT). The MNT is separated and then renitrated to dinitrotoluene (DNT). In the final step, the DNT is nitrated to trinitrotoluene (TNT) using an anhydrous mixture of nitric acid and <b>oleum.</b> Nitric acid is consumed by the manufacturing process, but the diluted sulfuric acid can be reconcentrated and reused. [...] After nitration, TNT is stabilized by a process called sulfitation, where the crude TNT is treated with aqueous sodium sulfite solution to remove less stable isomers of TNT and other undesired reaction products. [...] The rinse water from sulphitation is known as red water and is a significant pollutant and waste product of TNT manufacture.|$|E
2500|$|SDS is {{synthesized}} {{by treating}} lauryl alcohol with sulfur trioxide gas, <b>oleum,</b> or chlorosulfuric acid to produce hydrogen lauryl sulfate.

[...] When produced from these sources, commercial samples of these [...] "SDS" [...] products are actually not pure SDS, rather a mixture of various sodium alkyl sulfates with SDS being the main component. [...] For instance, SDS is a component, along with other chain-length amphiphiles, when produced from coconut oil, and is known as sodium coco sulfate (SCS). SDS is available commercially in powder, pellet, and other forms (each differing in rates of dissolution), as well as in aqueous solutions of varying concentrations.|$|E
