Thirty-six silk cloths of domestic manufacture, not previously used in parachute construction are compared with some silk cloths of foreign manufacture. These foreign cloths were ones proven by trial and extended use to be suitable materials for parachute construction. Contrary {{to the belief that}} domestic woven cloths were not suitable materials for parachute construction, it is shown that many domestic silk cloths are satisfactory and in some respects superior to the foreign products.

5|$|The body is {{the main}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloth,</b> and is filled {{with a wide variety}} of patterns. The body can be divided into two {{alternating}} patterns and colours called pagi-sore ('dawn-dusk'). Brighter pattern are shown during the day, while darker pattern are shown in the evening. The alternating colours give the impression of two batik sets.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{patterns}} are only used in certain sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloth.</b> For example, {{a row of}} isosceles triangles, forming the pasung motif, as well as diagonal floral motifs called dhlorong, are commonly used for the head. However, pasung and dhlorong are occasionally found in the body. Other motifs such as buketan (flower bouquet) and birds are commonly used in either the head or the body.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{cultivated}} {{the image}} of a Renaissance man, and his court was a centre of scholarly and artistic innovation and glamorous excess, epitomised by the Field <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cloth</b> of Gold. He scouted the country for choirboys, taking some directly from Wolsey's choir, and introduced Renaissance music into court. Musicians included Benedict de Opitiis, Richard Sampson, Ambrose Lupo, and Venetian organist Dionisio Memo.|$|E

40|$|Three {{filter cloth}} fabrics {{commonly}} used in drains for coal waste embankments were tested by <b>the</b> Bureau <b>of</b> Mines for clogging behavior and deterioration under simulated field conditions. The objective was to provide guidelines for the mining industry for the proper selection and use of filter cloths to assure safer embankments at mine waste disposal sites. <b>The</b> filter <b>cloths</b> were tested with three coal waste samples in stand-pipes used to simulate coal mine waste disposal environments. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloths</b> showed a tendency to become clogged with fines from the wastes. One waste caused clogging by precipitating an iron-silicon compound on <b>the</b> test <b>cloths.</b> No apparent cloth deterioration resulted from exposures to the simulated coal waste environments. (The exposures ranged from 2 to 12 months.) In other tests, exposures to waters in <b>the</b> pH range <b>of</b> 2 to 12 and to reagents used in coal-preparation plants resulted in insignificant or no deterioration, as measured by tensile strength. However, long exposures to sunlight (ranging from 4. 6 to 6 months) caused major deterioration in two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloths</b> (86 -and 98 -pct losses in tensile strength) and slight deterioration in <b>the</b> third <b>cloth</b> (9 -pct loss in strength) ...|$|R

5|$|In 1469 Thomas Mathew (died 1469), {{the third}} or fourth son of Sir David Mathew (died 1484) of Llandaf, {{inherited}} the land by marriage to Catherine, heiress of Radyr, and built Radyr Court, a manor house on the site of what is now the Radyr Court Inn in Danescourt. The house was used as a court. Although it was destroyed by a fire in the 19th century, the three large dungeons survived and can still be seen at the Inn. On Thomas' death, his lands passed to his eldest son David and then to his younger son William Mathew (died 1528), who was knighted by King Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. Sir William accompanied Henry VIII to the Field <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cloth</b> of Gold in 1520. His successor was his eldest son Sir George Mathew, who became MP for Glamorganshire and in 1545 Sheriff of Glamorgan.|$|E
5|$|Several years later, {{according}} to a narration collected by historian Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad was involved with a well-known story about setting the Black Stone {{in place in the}} wall of the Kaaba in 605 CE. The Black Stone, a sacred object, was removed during renovations to the Kaaba. The Meccan leaders could not agree which clan should return the Black Stone to its place. They decided to ask the next man who comes through the gate to make that decision; that man was the 35-year-old Muhammad. This event happened five years before the first revelation by Gabriel to him. He asked for a cloth and laid the Black Stone in its center. The clan leaders held the corners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloth</b> and together carried the Black Stone to the right spot, then Muhammad laid the stone, satisfying the honour of all.|$|E
5|$|The {{greens are}} mostly verdigris, {{although}} those predominant {{in the landscape}} are mostly blends of blue and yellow pigments, and the green <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloth</b> worn by Mary Salome is malachite mixed with yellow lake. The browns are blends of reds and blacks. John's red robe is composed from cinnabar and vermilion made from rubia and insect dyes. Some of the reds are mixed with earth colours not susceptible {{to the effects of}} light, and have thus survived close to their original appearance. The black pigments are generally bone blacks but in places from charcoal. The blacks are mixed with chalk in areas, producing a red to brownish 'earthy' appearance.|$|E
30|$|It is {{reasonable}} to suggest that <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> scratches is significantly affected by <b>the</b> hardness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plastic and the pressure exerted during the cleaning process.

5|$|In 1660 the {{population}} of the town (only including the urban parts of the parish) has been estimated at 1,800, which made it the 10th largest town in Devon and Cornwall. The town's population grew to 2,750 by 1750 (meaning it was the 8th largest town) but it then fell rapidly so that it was only 2,275 by 1805 - only the 23rd largest town in Devon and Cornwall. This fall in population, in a period when many other towns grew rapidly, was probably due to the decline in the importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloth</b> trade in this period. The population of the parish changed little {{from the start of the}} 19th century until the 1970s, remaining at around 3,000 (see chart). However it increased rapidly in the last part of the 20th century and the start of the 21st. Cullompton's population growth looks set to continue as Mid Devon's core strategy foresees 95 new dwellings being built per year in the period to 2026.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, Victoria took a keen {{interest}} in the improvement of relations between France and Britain. She made and hosted several visits between the British royal family and the House of Orleans, who were related by marriage through the Coburgs. In 1843 and 1845, she and Albert stayed with King Louis Philippe I at chÃ¢teau d'Eu in Normandy; she was the first British or English monarch to visit a French one since the meeting of Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France on the Field <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cloth</b> of Gold in 1520. When Louis Philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844, he became the first French king to visit a British sovereign. Louis Philippe was deposed in the revolutions of 1848, and fled to exile in England. At the height of a revolutionary scare in the United Kingdom in April 1848, Victoria and her family left London for the greater safety of Osborne House, a private estate on the Isle of Wight that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped. Demonstrations by Chartists and Irish nationalists failed to attract widespread support, and the scare died down without any major disturbances. Victoria's first visit to Ireland in 1849 was a public relations success, but it had no lasting impact or effect on the growth of Irish nationalism.|$|E
5|$|The cloth {{on which}} the work was painted had been lined with a more finely woven piece of linen and restretched, {{probably}} by the same person who stretched and lined the other works identified with the larger altarpiece. It was placed under glass, probably in the early 19th century and certainly before its acquisition by the National Gallery (Eastlake noted that it was under glass in 1858). The piece was evidently sent rolled and unframed to its patron. The brown border painted along the four sides indicates where the frame should be positioned when it is added to its final support. The row of rust-stained nail holes running along the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloth</b> {{is evidence that the}} frame was eventually positioned within the pictorial field, at a point far lower than Bouts had intended. This low framing protected a portion of the canvas from deterioration and allows us {{to see some of the}} colours as they would have originally appeared.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Tenun Gringsing (Gringsing woven cloth) is a craft made {{of colored}} cotton yarn with weaving technique. The woven fabric is in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> sheet with various sizes, colors, and motifs. Tenun Gringsing is {{commonly}} called double ikat, which is <b>the</b> landmark <b>of</b> Tenganan Pegringsingan village. <b>The</b> woven <b>cloth</b> {{functions as a}} ritual medium in customary, religious, and marital activities inherited from their ancestors. Commodification with creative touch creating a product with new meanings emerges as <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> modernization. It causes <b>the</b> shift <b>of</b> values from sacred to secular ones, which has soft power. It is marked by <b>the</b> change <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clothâs</b> function from ritual purposes to fashion, which still upholds local values possessing cultural force ensuring victory in the global competition. The research used commodification and the main theory. <b>The</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study is Tenganan Pegringsingan village, Karangasem, Bali. It is a qualitative descriptive study with ethnographic and historical approaches. The data were collected by observing <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> Tenun Gringsing, interviewing relevant informants including crafters, community leaders, merchants, and tourists. In conclusion, <b>the</b> commodification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clothâs</b> meaning is <b>the</b> villagersâ openness to global culture.

5|$|The street plan of {{the town}} still {{reflects}} the medieval layout of the town. Most shops lie along Fore Street with courts behind them linked by alleyways. The length of the high street reflects the prosperity of the town from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century {{when it was a}} centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloth</b> trade. The street plan is still fundamentally the same as shown on a map of 1663, with a wider area at the North end where markets were held, roads to Tiverton and Ponsford and a small lane leading down to a mill (now known as Lower Mill). This map has only two buildings with roofs coloured blue (conventionally meaning they were of slate) â St Andrew's church and the Walronds. There are two grade I listed buildings in Cullompton: the fifteenth century parish church (St Andrew's) and the Walronds at 6 Fore Street. There are also seven grade II* listed buildings and ninety grade II listed buildings. The centre of the town is a conservation area â {{the only one in the}} Mid Devon area. Hillersdon House, a Victorian manor house is near to the town centre and within the parish.|$|E
5|$|This theory {{stems from}} the various rumours {{spreading}} after Centaurs sinking. If Centaur had been in breach of the Hague Convention of 1907, and someone had informed the Japanese of this, I-177 may have been under valid orders to attack. When Centaur left Sydney, her decks were packed with green-uniformed men, and as Field Ambulance uniforms were only distinguishable from other Army uniforms by badge insignia and the colouration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloth</b> band ringing the hat, a distant observer could {{have concluded that the}} hospital ship was transporting soldiers. Those witnessing the loading in Sydney would have seen the ambulance drivers bring their weapons aboard, and could have come to a similar conclusion. If a spy or informant had passed this information to the Japanese, I-177 could have been lying in wait. The main flaw in this theory is the question of how Nakagawa and his crew were able to predict that Centaur was taking an alternative route and how they were able to determine the new route selected.|$|E
5|$|Charles V {{ascended the}} thrones of both Spain and the Holy Roman Empire {{following}} {{the deaths of}} his grandfathers, Ferdinand in 1516 and Maximilian in 1519. Francis I likewise became king of France upon the death of Louis in 1515, leaving three relatively young rulers and {{an opportunity for a}} clean slate. The careful diplomacy of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey had resulted in the Treaty of London in 1518, aimed at uniting the kingdoms of western Europe {{in the wake of a}} new Ottoman threat, and it seemed that peace might be secured. Henry met Francis I on 7 June 1520 at the Field <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cloth</b> of Gold near Calais for a fortnight of lavish entertainment. Both hoped for friendly relations in place of the wars of the previous decade. The strong air of competition laid to rest any hopes of a renewal of the Treaty of London, however, and conflict was inevitable. Henry had more in common with Charles, whom he met once before and once after Francis. Charles brought the Empire into war with France in 1521; Henry offered to mediate, but little was achieved and by the end of the year Henry had aligned England with Charles. He still clung to his previous aim of restoring English lands in France, but also sought to secure an alliance with Burgundy, then part of Charles' realm, and the continued support of Charles. A small English attack in the north of France made up little ground. Charles defeated and captured Francis at Pavia and could dictate peace; but he believed he owed Henry nothing. Sensing this, Henry decided to take England out of the war before his ally, signing the Treaty of the More on 30 August 1525.|$|E
25|$|In 1532, {{the shroud}} {{suffered}} damage from {{a fire in}} a chapel of ChambÃ©ry, capital <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Savoy region, where it was stored.
