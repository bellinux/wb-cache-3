5|$|Avoidance of risk factors, {{including}} {{smoking and}} air pollution, {{is the primary}} method of prevention. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend {{on the type of}} cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's <b>overall</b> <b>health.</b> Most cases are not curable. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{prevention}} {{programs have been}} found to reduce the cost of treating obesity-related disease. However, the longer people live, the more medical costs they incur.

5|$|Porpoises {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to anthropogenic disturbances, and are keystone species, which can indicate the <b>overall</b> <b>health</b> of the marine environment. Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are under increasing pressure from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises. Increasing pollution is a serious problem for marine mammals. Heavy metals and plastic waste are not biodegradable, and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring. Harbour porpoises from the English Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals.|$|E

5|$|The {{specific}} type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a person's prognostic factors (see above) and general health. For good-prognosis leukemias (i.e. inv(16), t(8;21), and t(15;17)), people will typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy, known as consolidation chemotherapy. For people {{at high risk of}} relapse (e.g. those with high-risk cytogenetics, underlying MDS, or therapy-related AML), allogeneic stem cell transplantation is usually recommended if the person is able to tolerate a transplant and has a suitable donor. The best postremission therapy for intermediate-risk AML (normal cytogenetics or cytogenetic changes not falling into good-risk or high-risk groups) is less clear and depends on the specific situation, including the age and <b>overall</b> <b>health</b> of the person, the person's values, and whether a suitable stem cell donor is available.|$|E
5|$|From March 1958 Formby {{appeared}} in the musical comedy Beside the Seaside, a Holiday Romp in Hull, Blackpool, Birmingham and Brighton. By the time it reached Brighton the play was playing to increasingly small audiences, and the run was cut short as a result. The play {{may not have been}} to southern audiences' tastes—the plot centres on a northern family's holiday in Blackpool—and the Brighton audiences may have been too small, but those in the north, particularly Blackpool, thought highly of it and the show was a nightly sell-out. When the show closed Formby was disappointed, and vowed never to appear in another stage musical. The year 1958 was professionally quiet for him; in addition to Beside the Seaside, he also worked in one-off appearances in three television shows. He began 1959 by appearing in Val Parnell's Spectacular: The Atlantic Showboat in January, and in April hosted his own show, Steppin' Out With Formby. During the summer season he appeared at the Windmill Theatre, Great Yarmouth, although he missed two weeks of performances when he was involved in a car crash on the August Bank Holiday. When doctors examined him, they were concerned with his <b>overall</b> <b>health,</b> {{partly as a result of}} his forty cigarettes-a-day smoking habit. He also had high blood pressure, was overweight and had heart problems.|$|E
5|$|Mario's health {{consists}} of a three-piece health meter, which is depleted through contact with enemies and hazards. When swimming underwater, Mario has an air supply meter, which quickly depletes his main health meter if it runs out. Mario's health and air supply can be restored by collecting coins, or through touching bubbles if underwater. When the health meter becomes empty, the player loses a life and must {{go back to a}} predetermined checkpoint. The health meter can be temporarily expanded to six units {{through the use of a}} Life Mushroom, with the maximum health returning to three units if the <b>overall</b> <b>health</b> falls to three units from enemy or hazard contact, or if Mario suffers instant death. Instant death can occur by being swallowed by quicksand or dark matter; falling into bottomless pits, which either consist of black holes or by leaving a planet's gravitational pull and falling into space. The player can obtain extra lives by collecting 1-Up Mushrooms, 50 coins without losing a life, or 50 Star Bits.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background A {{growing body}} of {{epidemiologic}} evidence links oral health, obesity, and cardiovascular health, though few studies have reported on these relationships in children. While underlying mechanisms are unclear, adult studies have suggested sub-acute systemic inflammation, also implicated in the etiology of both obesity and cardiovascular disease. This study investigated associations between self-reported dental hygiene, obesity, and systemic inflammation in children. Methods 128 children Results Participants ranged from 3. 0 - 18. 7 years. Univariate analysis demonstrated an association between parent-reported dental hygiene, including frequency of preventive dental care and parent-assessed <b>overall</b> dental <b>health,</b> and markers of systemic inflammation but not obesity. In multivariable regression, parent-assessed <b>overall</b> dental <b>health</b> and obesity were independent predictors of systemic inflammation, after adjustment for age, gender, and parent education. Conclusions This is the first known study of the association between dental hygiene, obesity, and systemic inflammation in children. These results highlight the importance of preventive dental care in <b>overall,</b> systemic <b>health</b> in children and are consistent with previous reports in adults. </p...|$|R
