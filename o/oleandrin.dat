The fatal blood concentration of <b>oleandrin</b> has been estimated for humans to be approximately 20 ng/ml in decreased blood by extrapolation of intoxication symptoms. In practice, there have been adult cases wherein 14-20 oleander leaves (of unknown <b>oleandrin</b> concentration) proved not to be fatal, but also a lethal case of a child that consumed only one leaf.|$|E

50|$|It is {{excreted}} {{mostly in}} feces, {{but also in}} urine. Because the main route of excretion is through biliary excretion into the feces, it is mainly the liver that is exposed to <b>oleandrin.</b> As excretion in urine is only a smaller route, the kidneys are less exposed. There is also accumulation in the cardiac tissue, which explains its potential for cardiac toxicity. In mouse studies, it also appeared that <b>oleandrin</b> rapidly accumulates in brain tissue, as it can pass through the blood-brain barrier. The data suggest that other components within oleander extract may enhance transport of <b>oleandrin</b> across the blood-brain barrier.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Oleandrin</b> is a {{promising}} agent for anti-cancer treatment. Studies show potential in vitro effect for cancers of the colon, non-small cell lung cancer, leukemia, pancreas, melanoma [...] and prostate. It may {{work as a}} cytotoxic agent, generating reactive oxygen species or inducing apoptosis, but has also shown to be synergistic with current chemotherapy. This {{may be due to}} its potential to inhibit P-glycoprotein. This transporter is responsible for phenotypes of cancer resistant to chemotherapeutic agents.Although this sounds promising, in general, concentrations needed for therapeutic effect are not achievable in patient plasma. Apart from being a chemosensitizer, <b>oleandrin</b> has shown to be a potent radiosensitizer. <b>Oleandrin</b> increases caspase 3 activity in radiodamaged tumor cells and, therefore, increases radiation-induced apoptosis. It is unclear as to whether normal cells suffer the same degree of radiosensitization; however, if they do, <b>oleandrin</b> might not be suitable for combined treatment with radiation therapy.|$|E

50|$|Because of its {{properties}} as {{a cardiac}} glycoside, <b>oleandrin</b> interferes in some essential processes within the cell, {{the most important}} of these being the inhibition of the Na-K ATPase. This protein enables the cell to exchange the cations Na+ and K+ between the intercellular and extracellular spaces by which, for instance, electronic signaling is made possible in nerve cells. <b>Oleandrin</b> binds to specific amino acids in the protein, causing it to lose its function. After depolarization of the cell in which Na+ flows into the cell, the Na+ cannot be transported back into the extracellular membrane, causing the sodium gradient to disappear. This gradient is the driving force for other transport proteins, such as the sodium-calcium exchanger, which plays an important role in cardiomyocytes.|$|E
5000|$|Onset of {{symptoms}} may {{vary with the}} way of intake. Teas made of leaves or root of N. oleander {{give rise to a}} more acute onset, while eating raw leaves causes a slower onset {{of symptoms}}. Management of <b>oleandrin</b> poisoning is done in the following steps: ...|$|E
50|$|Previously forced {{vomiting}} or performing {{gastric lavage}} {{was part of}} the treatment of poisoning, but is no longer recommended.There is a lack of evidence that weighs efficacy versus harm.Activated charcoal is still used, since it binds toxins in the gastrointestinal tract to reduce absorption. It is uncertain whether repeated administration of activated charcoal is effective, in theory interrupting enterohepatic cycling. This treatment is used for digoxin poisoning, another cardiac glycoside.Supportive care like monitoring vitals and electrolyte and fluid balance is important. Patients may present hypovolemic due to vomiting and diarrhea, but severely elevated potassium can also occur.Electrolyte balance is vital, since patients with low cardiac glycoside levels can still die after adequate digoxin Fab antibody treatment if they have disturbed electrolyte levels.Treatment of bradyarrhythmias is by many done with intravenous isoprenaline and/or atropine.In moderate cases, prolonging of the PR interval and progression to AV dissociation, cardiac pacing is used.The effectiveness of all these interventions is unknown and are associated with side-effects. Therefore, consultation with a cardiologist is recommended when managing significant N. Oleander induced arrhythmias. The use of anti-digoxin Fab IV has proven successful in cases of <b>oleandrin</b> poisoningThese antibodies have shown to bind in vitro with <b>oleandrin</b> and thus reduce the active concentration in the blood A dose of 400 mg is used in digoxin poisoning, but a dose of 800 mg is recommended for <b>oleandrin</b> poisoning due to the lower binding affinity of the antibody to <b>oleandrin.</b> Patients receiving an adequate dose of anti-digoxin Fab show a good response, resolving serious arrhythmias in two hours in fifty percent of the cases. Treated patients showed a rapid increase in heart rate and a significant decline in serum potassium levels. The reason anti-digoxin Fab is sparingly used in developing countries is its high cost, even though it is such an effective treatment.|$|E
50|$|Oleander has {{historically}} been considered a poisonous plant because some of its compounds may exhibit toxicity, especially to animals, when consumed in large amounts. Among these compounds are <b>oleandrin</b> and oleandrigenin, known as cardiac glycosides, which {{are known to have}} a narrow therapeutic index and can be toxic when ingested.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis of <b>oleandrin</b> {{poisoning}} {{is mainly}} {{based on a}} detailed history. Whether or not a plant is ingested, description of the plant, or the plant itself, {{how much of it}} was ingested, time between ingestion and symptoms are all relevant questions. These can be asked only when the patient is not unconscious, which may happen due to cardiac symptoms, or when a third person is present. Supportive treatment should always be given to those with severe cardiac arrhythmias. History of poisoning (of a plant), ECG abnormalities that fit digoxin poisoning, and being in a region with N. oleander suggest poisoning with the plant.Three methods are used for detecting <b>oleandrin</b> in the blood. Fluorescence polarization immunoassay is widely used. This test is slower and has a lower sensitivity than digoxin immunoassay (Digoxin III).A direct analytic technique like liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry is used when there are medicolegal issues.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of <b>oleandrin</b> contains a central steroid nucleus with an unsaturated lactone ring structure on C17 and a dideoxy arabinose group on C3. In addition, the steroid ring has a substitute of an acetyloxy group on C16.Oleandrin resembles very much other glycosides like ouabain and digoxin but has less effect than digoxin. It is however, just like its derivate oleandrigenin, a more potent glycoside than ouabain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oleandrin</b> {{poisoning}} {{by eating}} oleander leaves can be lethal at low dosages. Cases of sheep lethality {{have been reported}} to only one leaf of Oleander.Symptoms present in poisoned animals include bloody diarrhea and colic, the latter especially in horses. Because the leaf itself is quite bitter, only starving animals will be likely to eat the plant. The lethal dosage for animals is estimated to be about 0.5 mg/kg.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from being}} a potent toxic compound, {{it may also be}} used in {{therapeutic}} ways. Both <b>oleandrin</b> and oleandrigenin, as well as their relatives, may be able to inhibit proliferation of tumor cells and stimulate their apoptosis {{as a result of the}} high concentration of intracellular calcium. In addition, it inhibits excretion of fibroblast growth factor 2 through membrane interaction and through inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase pump. However, there are no results from clinical testing on humans that support any use as a cancer treatment.|$|E

On 29 April Nearula started 2/1 favourite against fifteen opponents in the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket. Ridden by Britt, he took the lead two furlongs from the finish and drew clear of the field to win decisively by four lengths from the filly Bebe Grande, with <b>Oleandrin</b> a further three lengths back in third place. Nearula's success was the first 2000 Guineas win of the century for a Yorkshire-trained horse.|$|E
5000|$|Symptoms of <b>oleandrin</b> {{poisoning}} {{can cause}} both gastrointestinal and cardiac effects. The gastrointestinal effects can consist of nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting, {{as well as}} higher salivation and diarrhea (which may contain blood). After these first symptoms, the heart may be affected by tachyarrhythmia, bradyarrhythmia, premature ventricular contractions, or atrioventricular blockage. Also, xanthopsia (yellow vision), a burning sensation of the mucous membranes of the eyes, and gastrointestinal tract and respiratory paralysis can occur. [...] Reactions to poisonings from this plant can also affect the central nervous system. These symptoms can include drowsiness, tremors, or shaking of the muscles, seizures, collapse, and even coma {{that can lead to}} death. Oleander sap can cause skin irritations, severe eye inflammation and irritation, and allergy reactions characterized by dermatitis when administered topically.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{despite the}} common [...] "poisonous" [...] {{designation}} of this plant, very few toxic events in humans have been reported. According to the Toxic Exposure Surveillance System, in 2002, 847 human exposures to oleander {{were reported to}} poison centers in the United States. Despite this exposure level, from 1985 through 2005, only three deaths were reported. One cited death was apparently due to the ingestion of oleander leaves by a diabetic man. His blood indicated a total blood concentration of cardiac glycosides of about 20 μg/l, which is well above the reported fatal level. Another study reported {{on the death of}} a woman who self-administered [...] "an undefined oleander extract" [...] both orally and rectally and her <b>oleandrin</b> tissue levels were 10 to 39 μg/g, which were in the high range of reported levels at autopsy. In 2000, the death of two toddlers in El Segundo was attributed to eating oleander.|$|E

40|$|<b>Oleandrin</b> is a {{glycoside}} that inhibits {{the ubiquitous}} enzyme Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase.

Here, we evaluated {{for the first time}} the effect of <b>oleandrin</b> on brain tumors. To this aim, mice were transplanted with human or murine glioma and analyzed for tumor progression upon <b>oleandrin</b> treatment. In both systems, <b>oleandrin</b> impaired glioma development, reduced tumor size, and inhibited cell proliferation. We demonstrated that <b>oleandrin</b> does the following: (1) enhances the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level in the brain; (2) reduces both microglia/macrophage infiltration and CD 68 immunoreactivity in the tumor mass; (3) decreases astrogliosis in peritumoral area; and (4) reduces glioma cell infiltration in healthy parenchyma. In BDNF-deficient mice (bdnftm 1 Jae/J) and in glioma cells silenced for TrkB receptor expression, <b>oleandrin</b> was not effective, indicating a crucial role for BDNF in oleandrin's protective and antitumor functions.

40|$|Our {{previous}} study has reported the anti-tumor effect of <b>oleandrin</b> on osteosarcoma (OS) cells. In the current study, we mainly explored its potential regulation on intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathway in OS cells. Cells apoptosis, {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were detected using fluorescence staining and flow cytometry. Caspase- 3 activity was detected using a commercial kit. The levels of cytoplasmic cytochrome c, mitochondrial cytochrome c, bcl- 2, bax, caspase- 9, Fas, FasL, caspase- 8 and caspase- 3 were detected by Western blotting. z-VAD-fmk was applied to block both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways, and cells apoptosis was also tested. Furthermore, we used z-LEHD-fmk and Fas blocking antibody to inhibit intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, separately, and the selectivity of <b>oleandrin</b> on these pathways was explored. Results showed that <b>oleandrin</b> induced the apoptosis of OS cells, which was accompanied {{by an increase in}} ROS and a decrease in MMP.

In addition, the suppression of both apoptotic pathways by z-VAD-fmk greatly reverted the oleandrin-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the suppression of one pathway by a corresponding inhibitor did not affect the regulation of <b>oleandrin</b> on another pathway.

40|$|Cardiac glycosides such as <b>oleandrin</b> {{are known}} to inhibit the Na,K-ATPase pump, {{resulting}} in a consequent increase in calcium influx in heart muscle. Here, we investigated the effect of <b>oleandrin</b> on the growth of human and mouse cancer cells in relation to Na,K-ATPase subunits. Olean-drin treatment resulted in selective inhibition of human cancer cell growth but not rodent cell proliferation, which corresponded to the relative level of Na,K-ATPase α 3 sub-unit protein expression. Human pancreatic cancer cell lines were found to differentially express varying levels of α 3 protein, but rodent cancer cells lacked discernable expression of this Na,K-ATPase isoform. A correlation was observed between the ratio of α 3 to α 1 isoforms {{and the level of}} <b>oleandrin</b> uptake during inhibition of cell growth and initiation of cell death; the higher the α 3 ex-pression relative to α 1 expression, the more sensitive the cell was to treatment with <b>oleandrin.</b> Inhibition of pro-liferation of Panc- 1 cells by <b>oleandrin</b> was significantly re-duced when the relative expression of α 3 was decreased by knocking down the expression of α 3 isoform with α 3 siRNA or increasing expression of the α 1 isoform through transient transfection of α 1 cDNA to the cells. Our data suggest that the relative lack of α 3 (relative to α 1) in rodent and some human tumor cells may explain their un-responsiveness to cardiac glycosides. In conclusion, the relatively higher expression of α 3 with the limited expres-sion of α 1 may help predict which human tumors are likely to be responsive to treatment with potent lipid-soluble car-diac glycosides such as <b>oleandrin.</b> [Mol Cancer Ther 2009; 8 (8) : 2319 – 28...|$|E

In PANC- 1 cells, a human pancreatic cancer cell line, cell death occurs not through apoptosis but rather through autophagy. <b>Oleandrin</b> at low nanomolar concentrations potently inhibited cell prolifera-tion associated with induction of a profound G 2 /M cell cycle arrest. Inhibition of cell cycle was not accompanied by any significant sub G 1 accumulation of cells, suggesting a nonapoptotic mechanism. Oleandrin-treated cells exhib-ited time- and concentration-dependent staining with acri-dine orange, a lysosomal stain. Subcellular changes within PANC- 1 cells included mitochondrial condensation and translocation to a perinuclear position accompanied by vacuoles. Use of a fluorescent <b>oleandrin</b> analog (BODIPY-oleandrin) revealed co-localization of the drug within cell mitochondria. Damaged mitochondria were found within autophagosome structures. Formation of autophagosomes was confirmed through electron microscopy and detection of green fluorescent protein–labeled light chain 3 associa-tion with autophagosome membranes. Also observed was a drug-mediated inhibition of pAkt formation and up-regula-tion of pERK. Transfection of Akt into PANC- 1 cells or inhibition of pERK activation by MAPK inhibitor abrogated oleandrin-mediated inhibition of cell growth, suggesting that the reduction of pAkt and increased pERK are impor-tant to oleandrin’s ability to inhibit tumor cell prolifera-tion.

40|$|Neuroblastoma {{is a type}} of {{malignant}} solid {{tumors in}} the sympathetic nervous system, which has unknown etiology until now. Also, in the childhood, it is the most frequently encountered cancer after central nervous system tumors [1]. For the treatment of neuroblastoma, chemotherapy drugs are often used and they provide a reduction of the tumor size or partial recession. However, the results are not stable, because after the treatment, the cancer could relapse [3]. Likewise, it is known that many chemotherapy agents, such as Cyclophosphamide, Ifosfamide, Doxorubicin, Cisplatin, and Carboplatin have many side effects, e. g., hematuria, infertility, etc. At the same time, they could damage heart, and affect hearing and kidneys [4]. Considering all treatment strategies for neuroblastoma, {{there is a need for}} alternative drugs. <b>Oleandrin,</b> is a molecule that is a group of cardiac glycosides and derived from Nerium oleander (Oleander). It is shown that low concentrations of <b>Oleandrin</b> selectively kills tumor cells [5, 6, 7], reduces the side effects of chemotherapy and strengthens the immune system [8]. In vitro testing a drug in three-dimensional (3 D) cell culture systems is more effective than monolayer, two-dimensional (2 D) cell culture systems. Because, 3 D systems simulate pathological conditions and mimick human tissue micro-environment much closely in vitro. Additionally, the drug can diffuse across multi-layers of cells to reach the target area inside and/or around of a 3 D micro tissue [9]. In this study, we performed a comparative study on cytotoxic effects of <b>Oleandrin</b> in 2 D and 3 D in vitro models of human neuroblastoma using SH-SY 5 Y cell line.
