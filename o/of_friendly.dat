5|$|The {{campaign}} was brought forward by {{one day to}} 20 September. The change of schedule caused the JNA 1st Guards Mechanised Division to commit to battle as it arrived in eastern Slavonia with no reconnaissance or preparation. The resulting traffic jam on the ŠidTovarnikStari Jankovci road prevented bridging units from reaching the Bosut River. That in turn prevented the 1st Guards Division from crossing the river and confined it to the area between the Bosut and the Danube, east of Vinkovci. Besides the bridging units, the division did not receive the 80th Motorised Brigadewhich appears to have disintegrated before reaching the Croatian frontierand the 2nd Guards Mechanised Brigadea victim <b>of</b> <b>friendly</b> fire bombardment in the area between Tovarnik and Ilača adjacent to the border. Several units of the Novi Sad Corps also disintegrated when morale declined after a number <b>of</b> <b>friendly</b> fire incidents.|$|E

5|$|At 1:55p.m., {{just before}} the start of the war, a {{reconnaissance}} force swam to the east bank of the Suez Canal, two kilometers south of Fort Lahtzanit, and laid two ropes across the canal to facilitate the crossing <b>of</b> <b>friendly</b> forces. At 2:05p.m., as Operation Badr began, an artillery barrage was initiated against the fort using just the 85mm guns and B-10 recoilless rifles of the brigade's anti-tank company; the use of high trajectory artillery guns was forbidden since a number of Egyptian aircraft were flying over this area.|$|E
5|$|From 2000 to 2011, {{the stadium}} was the almost-permanent home of Welsh football.

The first Welsh football game at the stadium was played against Finland in 2000, and drew a then-record home crowd for Welsh football of over 66,000. This has since been beaten on several occasions. However, since 2011, the majority of home games have been played at the smaller Cardiff City Stadium, the home of Cardiff City.|$|E

Fearing for the dog's safety because Judd drinks and treats his hunting dogs poorly, Marty does not want to return Shiloh. His father insists that Shiloh be returned to his rightful owner and they take the dog home to Judd.|$|E

Each benchmark contains six categories: completion time, number of enemies destroyed, shot accuracy, number <b>of</b> <b>friendly</b> craft and structures saved, number of bonuses collected and lives remaining. If a player's performance exceeds {{one of the}} level's four benchmarks in all five categories, a medalbronze, silver, gold or platinumis awarded on completion.

5|$|The {{remaining}} 18 N-3PBs {{were used}} to equip No. 330 (Norwegian) Squadron RAF in Reykjavík, Iceland. The N-3PBs sent to Iceland were all shipped across the Atlantic in crates on board the Norwegian steamer , the voyage from New York to Reykjavik taking 13 days to complete. Part {{of the reason for}} deploying the N-3PBs to Iceland were to avoid having the unusual aircraft operating over the United Kingdom, with the involved risk <b>of</b> <b>friendly</b> fire incidents. The exiled Norwegian military authorities had originally wanted to base the squadron in the United Kingdom {{in order to be able}} to operate off German-occupied Norway.|$|E
5|$|After {{deciding}} not {{to renew}} the lease on the Four Acres, Albion moved to their fifth ground, Stoney Lane, {{in time for the}} 1885–86 season. The ground was located close to the Plough and Harrow public house, which served as the club's headquarters at the time. Albion took out an initial seven-year lease on the Stoney Lane site, paying an annual rent of £28 to its owner, a local undertaker named Mr Webb. The pitch was returfed and levelled, with ashes spread around the perimeter, and a wooden grandstand was built that {{came to be known as}} 'Noah's Ark'. The ground cost £370 to build, a sum that was offset by a number <b>of</b> <b>friendly</b> matches that took place early in the season.|$|E

5|$|After obtaining {{permission}} from the Mexican government to mount an expedition into Indian territory {{to search for the}} legendary silver mine, Bowie, his brother Rezin, and ten others set out for San Saba on November 2, 1831. Six miles (10km) from their goal, the group stopped to negotiate with a large raiding party of Indians—reportedly more than 120 Tawakoni and Waco, plus another 40 Caddo. The attempts at parley failed and Bowie and his group fought for their lives for the next 13hours. When the Indians finally retreated, Bowie reportedly had lost only one man, while more than 40Indians had been killed and 30 were wounded. In the meantime, a party <b>of</b> <b>friendly</b> Comanche rode into San Antonio bringing word of the raiding party, which outnumbered the Bowie expedition by 14 to 1. The citizens of San Antonio believed the members of the Bowie expedition must have perished, and Ursula Bowie began wearing widow's weeds.|$|E
5|$|After the Davis Cup tie Cochet only {{played in}} minor tournament and doubles matches. He won the singles in La Baule against Raymond Rodel and the mixed doubles in Vals-les-Bains. Rodel, Cochet, Jacques Brugnon and Pierre Henri Landry, {{representing}} the Racing Club de Paris, sailed to Japan {{for a series}} <b>of</b> <b>friendly</b> matches against the Japanese Davis Cup team where Cochet suffered a surprise defeat against Takeichi Harada. They then visited India to face the Indian Davis Cup team {{in a series of}} exhibitions. Cochet won all of his matches. In 1929 Cochet was ranked number one by several journals and journalists most notably by A Wallis Myers, Hungarian tennis magazine Tennisz és Golf, edited by Béla von Kehrling and on the list of rival Bill Tilden. Evidently he led the French rankings as well. In December he was inducted as Honorary Member to the U.S.L.T.A. in New York.|$|E

5|$|Britain had {{recognised}} Zanzibar's {{sovereignty and}} its sultanate in 1886, {{after a long}} period <b>of</b> <b>friendly</b> interaction, and generally maintained {{good relations with the}} country and its sultans. However, Germany was also interested in East Africa, and the two powers vied for control of trade rights and territory in the area throughout the late 19th century. Sultan Khalifah had granted rights to the land of Kenya to Britain and that of Tanganyika to Germany, a process resulting in the prohibition of slavery in those lands. Many of the Arab ruling classes were upset by this interruption of a valuable trade, which resulted in some unrest. In addition, the German authorities in Tanganyika refused to fly the flag of the Zanzibar Sultanate, which led to armed clashes between German troops and the local population. One such conflict in Tanga claimed the lives of 20 Arabs.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage for {{aircraft}} {{is complicated by}} the fact that the aircraft's background varies widely, depending on the location of the observer, the nature of the background and the aircraft's motion. For this reason, military aircraft were often painted to match the sky when viewed from below, and to either match the ground or break up the aircraft's outline when viewed from above. This is a form of countershading, likely to work best on aircraft such as heavy bombers that do not do fly inverted during combat. Because of the way light hits it, patterns of dark and light will often be present on an aircraft even if it is entirely one color, making it easier to see Reflections and specular highlights can be counteracted by painting an aircraft in neutral shades with a non-reflective, matte finish. There is a trade-off between the effectiveness of camouflage and the size of recognition markings: larger markings reduce the risk <b>of</b> <b>friendly</b> fire through misrecognition, but compromise camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there was}} damage to two Spanish frigates: the Sabina {{was struck by}} cannon fire during the night killing one man and {{wounding}} five, {{although it was not}} determined which ship had fired on the flagship and James suggested that it may have been from one of the destroyed 112-gun ships in a case <b>of</b> <b>friendly</b> fire. In addition, the Spanish 34-gun frigate Perla was seen wallowing off the North African coast of the Strait of Gibraltar on the morning of 13 July, sinking later in the day due to severe damage. How Perla came to be engaged in the action has never been explained. The ship was not part of Moreno's squadron at Algeciras and none of the British ships reported engaging a frigate during the night – during the hours of darkness Perla must have encountered the battle and become caught in the cross-fire, suffering fatal damage.|$|E
