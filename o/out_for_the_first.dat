5|$|L'Empire des Mille Planètes (Empire of a Thousand Planets) premiered in Pilote in 1969 {{and marked}} a further {{development}} for the Valérian series and for Mézières art. This story was the series' first full-blown attempt at space opera and it set <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time the two main signature elements of Valérian: the use of science fiction as a political allegory and Mézières' meticulously detailed depictions of alien worlds. The follow-up story World Without Stars saw the final evolution of Mézières' art into the style that became prevalent in the Valerian stories of the 1970s and 1980s, with the first realistic renderings of Valérian and Laureline, {{as opposed to the}} caricatures of the earlier stories.|$|E

5|$|During spring {{training}} in 2005, Nathan signed a two-year deal {{that includes a}} club option for 2008. He picked up from where he left off in 2004, allowing no earned runs in 15 appearances from April 5 to May 10. He also had streaks of 13 and 12 consecutive save opportunities converted between April and July. As a result, Nathan was named the American League Player of the Week for the week of June 27. Nathan earned another All-Star appearance in 2005 for his pitching {{in the first half}} of the season. Although his record was 1–3 with a 3.57 ERA in 37 appearances, he had struck out 43 batters in 35 innings pitched, and lead the AL with 23 saves in 25 opportunities. Nathan pitched in the 2005 MLB All-Star Game alongside fellow pitcher Johan Santana. Pitching the eighth inning of the game, he got Morgan Ensberg to pop <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> out, then gave out a double to Moisés Alou. Felipe López singled, and Nathan was able to get Miguel Cabrera and Luis Castillo out, but not before Alou scored. Nathan had a brilliant second half as he went 6–1 with 18 saves in 20 chances, and posted an ERA of 1.76. He finished the season with a 7–4 record, a 2.70 ERA, 43 saves in 48 opportunities, and 94 strikeouts. Nathan also became the third pitcher in club history to post consecutive 40 save seasons. The Twins however missed the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The {{series has}} {{generally}} sold well during its lifetime. The series' strongest sales base has been Japan: in 2007, sales distribution was 87% in Japan, 8% in North America, 3% in Europe and 2% in mainland Asia. The best-selling titles {{of the series}} {{at the time were}} Symphonia (953,000 copies for the GameCube, 486,000 for PlayStation 2), Destiny (1.1 million copies for PlayStation), Xillia (1 million copies for PlayStation 3) and Destiny 2 (977,000 copies for PlayStation 2). The sales data did not include mobile and online games. The success of entries has also been linked with the consoles they are released on: Vesperias release on the Xbox 360 caused the console to sell <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time in Japan, while Namco decided to release Zestiria on the PlayStation 3 due to the low sales prospects for next-gen consoles in their target audience. As of December 2013, the series has shipped 16 million units worldwide across 100 different countries.|$|E

They pushed this over 1,000W within weeks. The main Birmingham team gave up on the klystron and began work on this new cavity magnetron, and by the summer had examples producing 15kW. In April, GEC was told of their work {{and asked if they}} could further improve the design.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{preparing}} for the 2003 season, Fulton {{was hit in the}} eye by a ball from a bowling machine, whilst practising the pull shot.

Despite this, he still managed to score over 600 runs in eleven matches. He consistently scored runs for the next three seasons, whilst helping Kent challenge for first-class honours. 2004 saw Kent finish second to Warwickshire, and his side also challenged for the 2005 title.|$|E
