5|$|The {{exploits}} of the Brunswickers caught the British Victorian public's imagination: an example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> {{be found in}} John Everett Millais's painting The Black Brunswicker.

50|$|Molecular {{evolution}} occurs {{through small}} changes in the molecular or cellular level. Over a long period <b>of</b> time, <b>this</b> <b>can</b> cause big effects on the genetics of organisms. Taxonomic evolution occurs through small changes between populations and then species. Over a long period <b>of</b> time, <b>this</b> <b>can</b> cause big effects on the taxonomy of organisms, {{with the growth of}} whole new clades above the species level. Morphological evolution occurs through {{small changes in}} the morphology of an organism. Over a long period <b>of</b> time, <b>this</b> <b>can</b> cause big effects on the morphology <b>of</b> major clades. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> be clearly seen in the Cetacea, where throughout the group's early evolution, hindlimbs were still present. However over millions of years the hindlimbs regressed and became internal.|$|R

5|$|However, {{the same}} {{processes}} that create hoodoos will also eventually destroy them. In {{the case of}} Bryce Canyon, the hoodoos' rate of erosion is 24feet (0.61.3m) every 100 years. As the canyon continues to erode to the west it will eventually capture (in perhaps 3 million years) the watershed of the East Fork of the Sevier River. Once this river flows through Bryce Amphitheater it will dominate the erosional pattern; replacing hoodoos with a V-shaped canyon and steep cliff walls typical of the weathering and erosional patterns created by rivers. A foreshadowing <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> be observed in Water Canyon while hiking the Mossy Cave Trail. A diversion canal has been taking {{a portion of the}} East Fork of the Sevier River through this section of the park for over 100 years.|$|E
