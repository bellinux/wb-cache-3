25|$|If a batsman {{has been}} {{dismissed}} {{in every single}} innings, then their total number of runs scored divided by the number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>they</b> have been out gives exactly {{the average number of}} runs they score per innings. However, for a batsman with innings which have finished not out, this statistic is only an estimate of the average number of runs they score per innings – the true average number of runs they score per innings is unknown as it is not known how many runs they would have scored if they could have completed all their not out innings. If their scores have a geometric distribution then total number of runs scored divided by the number of times out is the maximum likelihood estimate of their true unknown average.|$|E

25|$|SQL Server {{also allows}} stored {{procedures}} to be defined. Stored procedures are parameterized T-SQL queries, that {{are stored in}} the server itself (and not issued by the client application {{as is the case}} with general queries). Stored procedures can accept values sent by the client as input parameters, and send back results as output parameters. They can call defined functions, and other stored procedures, including the same stored procedure (up to a set number <b>of</b> <b>times).</b> <b>They</b> can be selectively provided access to. Unlike other queries, stored procedures have an associated name, which is used at runtime to resolve into the actual queries. Also because the code need not be sent from the client every time (as it can be accessed by name), it reduces network traffic and somewhat improves performance. Execution plans for stored procedures are also cached as necessary.|$|E
25|$|In cricket, a player's {{batting average}} {{is the total}} number of runs they have scored divided by the number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>they</b> have been out. Since the number of runs a player scores and how often they get out are {{primarily}} measures of their own playing ability, and largely independent of their teammates, batting average is a good metric for an individual player's skill as a batsman. The number is also simple to interpret intuitively. If all the batsman's innings were completed (i.e. they were out every innings), this is the average number of runs they score per innings. If they did not complete all their innings (i.e. some innings they finished not out), this number is an estimate of the unknown average number of runs they score per innings. Batting average has been used to gauge cricket players' relative skills since the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|All {{characters}} have {{a light and}} a heavy attack, and all three can roll, block and sprint. Players can also perform critical strikes; when a yellow indicator appears {{over the head of}} an enemy a heavy attack will produce a critical strike, which are extra-strong attacks that often kills the enemy with a single hit. During a single-player game, players may issue orders to their AI companions; ordering them to either seek out enemies and attack, or stay near the player character and defend. Players may also revive fallen allies; if the player character dies, the player must wait to be revived by an AI ally. Another aspect of combat is the player's ability to summon a Great Eagle to aid them. The eagle can target a single foe for a large amount of damage. However, the player is limited in the number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>they</b> can summon him, and he can be summoned only when the player is in an outdoors location.|$|E

500|$|Mechanical type systems {{introduced}} {{near the}} end of the 19th century, such as the Linotype and Monotype machines, allowed for some variable sentence spacing similar to hand composition. [...] Just as these machines revolutionized the mass production of text, the advent of the typewriter around the same time revolutionized the creation of personal and business documents. [...] But the typewriters' mechanical limitations did not allow variable spacing—typists could only choose the number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>they</b> pressed the space bar. [...] Typists in some English-speaking countries initially learned to insert three spaces between sentences to approximate the wider sentence spacing used in traditional printing, but later settled on two spaces, a practice that continued throughout the 20th century. [...] This became known as English spacing, and marked a divergence from French typists, who continued to use French spacing.|$|E

Lord Kitchener ordered that no horses under [...] should be confiscated, {{at the request}} of many British children, who were concerned for the welfare of their ponies. The British Army Remount Service, in an effort to improve the supply of horses for potential military use, provided the services of high quality stallions to British farmers for breeding their broodmares. The already rare Cleveland Bay was almost wiped out by the war; smaller members of the breed were used to carry British troopers, while larger horses were used to pull artillery. New Zealand found that horses over [...] fared worse than those under that height. Well-built Thoroughbreds of 15hands and under worked well, as did compact horses of other breeds that stood [...] Larger crossbred horses were acceptable for regular work with plentiful rations, but proved less able to withstand short rations and long journeys. Riflemen with tall horses suffered more from fatigue, due to the number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>they</b> were required to mount and dismount the animals. Animals used for draught work, including pulling artillery, were also found to be more efficient when they were of medium size with good endurance than when they were tall, heavy and long-legged.|$|E

2500|$|More strictly, cells cannot 'count' {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>they</b> have divided [...] Telomeres {{are not a}} {{counting}} mechanism , {{though they may be}} used to indicate the number of times a particular chromosome has been replicated. Cellular processes for genetic material replication occur in both directions along DNA, 5' to 3' and on the other strand, 3' to 5'. As the 3' or 5' end is impossible for DNA polymerase to grab at the 1 base pair mark, a handful of basepairs (10-15) are cut off each replication. Over time, this cutting short of the DNA results in no telomeres, and the cell is unable to replicate that chromosome without cutting into genes.|$|E

2500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Athrun's character {{has often been}} positive. THEM Anime Reviews' Derrick L.

Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment stated that while Gundam SEED was primarily focused on Kira's growth, Athrun often [...] "stole the show {{in a lot of}} ways" [...] citing their rivalry and his angst displayed during its final episodes. Comments have also been focused on Athrun's and Kira's relationship with IGN's Andy Patrizio disliking the number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>they</b> shouted each other's names. Writing for Mania Entertainment, Kim Wolstenholme was worried about how much would Kira's and Athrun's relationship would be focused in Gundam SEED, but liked how Lacus's introduction added tension to it, because of how she and Kira started relating despite Athrun being engaged with her. Moreover, Ross Liversidge from UK Anime Network enjoyed the development from their rivalry as it resulted in well done fight scenes from each of their mobile suits. Furthermore, Athrun's confrontations with Cagalli across the series were praised due to how their characters' were developed while talking with each other.|$|E
2500|$|The battle {{system of}} the {{original}} Final Fantasy was designed by Akitoshi Kawazu.

He also added elements such as weapon and item abilities based on their successful implementation in [...] This first version of the battle system was a traditional turn-based system with characters appearing on the left-hand side of the screen, a feature later adopted by multiple other role-playing games (RPGs). For Final Fantasy II, Kawazu designed a battle system based around a more focused approach to story, along with accommodating for character classes being locked to specific characters. In Final Fantasy II, character abilities improved {{based on the number}} <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>they</b> were used and the number of hit points accumulated during battles: if a character used magic, they would become strong in magic while other attributes would suffer. For Final Fantasy III, the system changed back to a traditional class-based model: Kawazu stated that the reason for this was because no-one could fully understand the system he had created for Final Fantasy II.|$|E

However, Lindelof, who also reworked Prometheus and co-wrote Star Trek Into Darkness, {{did not have time}} to script the new ending and in July 2012, Paramount hired Lindelof's Lost partner, Drew Goddard. Lindelof explained there were inefficiencies in the script in relation to the shooting, which started before the script was finalized thus making the ending [...] "abrupt and incoherent" [...] and was missing a large chunk of footage. Lindelof presented two options to executives, who ultimately chose to shoot 30 to 40 minutes of additional footage to make a coherent ending. Goddard later told Creative Screenwriting, [...] "To me the big lesson of World War Z was that Paramount, Plan B and Brad Pitt simply said, 'Let's take the time to make this movie the best version of the movie before we put it on the screen for audience.'
