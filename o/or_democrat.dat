5000|$|Carmichael always {{championed the}} need for a two-party system in {{politics}} whether this meant [...] "Democrats and Republicans <b>or</b> <b>Democrats</b> and Loyal Democrats."

25|$|The {{results of}} the 1955 {{election}} {{have been attributed to}} fraud and intimidation. Voters were intimidated by a voting system involving colored pieces of paper that had to be put into a box in full view of Sihanouk's political figures, soldiers and local police. In many cases, voting results were simply falsified as in the case where a district that had been a Viet Minh stronghold for years did not return a single vote for the far left. Writer Philip Short points to a 1957 statement by Sihanouk admitting that thirty six electoral districts had voted Pracheachon <b>or</b> <b>Democrat</b> majority whereas the official results said that they had won none.|$|E
2500|$|National Public Radio (NPR) {{directed}} {{its staff}} in 2010 {{to use the}} adjective Democratic rather than Democrat. According to Ron Elving, NPR's senior Washington editor, it was the organization's policy to call parties by the name that they use to refer to themselves, saying: [...] "We should not refer to Democrat ideas <b>or</b> <b>Democrat</b> votes. Any deviation from that by NPR reporters on air or on line should be corrected".|$|E
2500|$|Romney said of {{the measure}} overall, [...] "There really wasn't Republican <b>or</b> <b>Democrat</b> in this. People ask me if this is {{conservative}} or liberal, and my answer is yes. It's liberal {{in the sense that}} we're getting our citizens health insurance. It's conservative in that we're not getting a government takeover." [...] The law was {{the first of its kind}} in the nation and became the signature achievement of Romney's term in office. [...] When Romney's official portrait was made for the Massachusetts State House, the composition included a leather binder with a medical seal representing the healthcare legislation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{political}} {{dominance of}} the liberal consensus even into the Nixon years can best be seen in policies such as the successful establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency or his failed proposal to replace the welfare system with a guaranteed annual income {{by way of a}} negative income tax. Affirmative action in its most quota-oriented form was a Nixon administration policy. Even the Nixon [...] "War on Drugs" [...] allocated two-thirds of its funds for treatment, a far higher ratio than was to be the case under any subsequent President, Republican <b>or</b> <b>Democrat.</b> Additionally, Nixon's normalization of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and his policy of détente with the Soviet Union were probably more popular with liberals than with his conservative base.|$|E
2500|$|Though she {{considered}} herself a Democrat at the time, Crosby was a keen admirer {{of the leading}} Whig, U.S. Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky, who in 1848 made a tour of large eastern cities. He visited the New York Institution for the Blind in New York City, where Crosby lived. The visit came {{two years after the}} death of Henry Clay, Jr., in the Mexican-American War. Crosby recalled that [...] "the great statesman was never quite himself after his son's death, and I purposely avoided all mention of it in the address of welcome on the day he came to visit us, lest I mighty wound the heart of the man whom I had learned not only to venerate but to love; for Mr. Clay was always an especial favorite among public men. There was a strength in his character and an earnestness in his speeches that appealed to me more than I can tell. ... I would have challenged any person, whether Whig <b>or</b> <b>Democrat,</b> Northerner or Southerner to come within range of the man's eloquence [...] without being moved to admiration and profound respect; for his personal magnetism was wonderful." ...|$|E

60|$|Then we loafed along {{past the}} Nickersons, {{and of course}} they asked if that was the new {{stranger}} yonder, and where'd he come from, and what was his name, and which communion was he, Babtis' or Methodis', and which politics, Whig <b>or</b> <b>Democrat,</b> and how long is he staying, and all them other questions that humans always asks when a stranger comes, and animals does, too. But Tom said he warn't able to make anything out of deef and dumb signs, and the same with goo-gooing. Then we watched them go and bullyrag Jake; because we was pretty uneasy for him. Tom said it would take him days to get so he wouldn't forget he was a deef and dummy sometimes, and speak out before he thought. When we had watched long enough to see that Jake was getting along all right and working his signs very good, we loafed along again, allowing to strike the schoolhouse about recess time, which was a three-mile tramp.|$|E

50|$|As an {{economic}} ideal, mixed economies {{are supported by}} people of various political persuasions, typically centre-left and centre-right, such as social <b>democrats</b> <b>or</b> Christian <b>Democrats.</b> Supporters view mixed economies as a compromise between state socialism and free-market capitalism that is superior in net effect to either of those.|$|R
