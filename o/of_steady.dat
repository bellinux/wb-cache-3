5|$|Hurricane Fred was the easternmost Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{to form in}} the tropics, and {{the first}} to move through Cape Verde since 1892. The second hurricane and sixth named storm of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season, Fred originated from a well-defined tropical wave over West Africa in late August2015. Once offshore, the wave moved northwestward within a favorable tropospheric environment and strengthened into a tropical storm on August30. The following day, Fred grew to a Category1 hurricane with peak winds of 85mph (140km/h) as it approached Cape Verde. After passing Boa Vista and moving away from Santo Antão, it entered a phase <b>of</b> <b>steady</b> weakening, dropping below hurricane status by September1. Fred then turned to the west-northwest, enduring increasingly hostile wind shear, but maintained its status as a tropical cyclone despite repeated forecasts of imminent dissipation. It fluctuated between minimal tropical storm and tropical depression strength through September45. Curving sharply to the north, Fred's circulation pattern had diminished considerably by September6, and the storm dissipated later that day.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} moved northwestward due to {{a weakness}} in the subtropical ridge. Despite early predictions <b>of</b> <b>steady</b> strengthening to reach 60mph (95km/h) within 48hours, the depression remained weak due to strong south-southwesterly wind shear. The shear remained strong, and though the National Hurricane Center forecast the system to remain a depression through September 30, the depression unexpectedly strengthened to Tropical Storm Kate on September 27, coinciding {{with an increase in}} deep convection near the center. Kate turned to the north and northeast, and despite 35mph (55km/h) of shear over the storm Kate continued to strengthen. A banding eye developed early on September 29, and later that day it intensified into a hurricane while located 655mi (1,055km) southwest of the Azores.|$|E

Secondly, the estimated vertical component <b>of</b> the <b>steady</b> velocity in each of the stations was positive (indicating uplift), while the estimated long-term exp component was negative (indicating subsidence).|$|R
5|$|Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley (1886) {{repeated}} Fizeau's {{experiment with}} improved accuracy, addressing several concerns with Fizeau's original experiment: (1) Deformation of the optical components in Fizeau's apparatus could cause artifactual fringe displacement; (2) observations were rushed, since the pressurized {{flow of water}} lasted only a short time; (3) the laminar flow profile of water flowing through Fizeau's small diameter tubes meant that only their central portions were available, resulting in faint fringes; (4) there were uncertainties in Fizeau's determination of flow rate across {{the diameter of the}} tubes. Michelson redesigned Fizeau's apparatus with larger diameter tubes and a large reservoir providing three minutes <b>of</b> <b>steady</b> water flow. His common path interferometer design provided automatic compensation of path length, so that white light fringes were visible at once as soon as the optical elements were aligned. Topologically, the light path was that of a Sagnac interferometer with an even number of reflections in each light path. This offered extremely stable fringes that were, to first order, completely insensitive to any movement of its optical components. The stability was such that it was possible for him to insert a glass plate at h or even to hold a lighted match in the light path without displacing the center of the fringe system. Using this apparatus, Michelson and Morley were able to completely confirm Fizeau's results.|$|E
