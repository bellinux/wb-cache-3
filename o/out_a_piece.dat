5|$|While Ferdinand {{kept the}} French occupied, Prussia {{had to contend}} with Sweden, Russia, and Austria, all of which wanted to carve <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of Prussia for themselves. Prussia could lose Silesia to Austria, Pomerania to Sweden, Magdeburg to Saxony, and East Prussia to Poland or Russia: an entirely nightmarish scenario. By 1758, Frederick was {{increasingly}} concerned by the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it. Just east of the Oder river in Brandenburg-Neumark, at the Battle of Zorndorf, on 25 August 1758 a Prussian army of 35,000 men fought a Russian army of 43,000. Both sides suffered heavy casualties but the Russians withdrew, and Frederick claimed victory. At the Battle of Tornow a month later, a Swedish army repulsed the Prussian army, but did not move on Berlin. By late summer, fighting had resulted in a draw. None of Prussia's enemies seemed willing to take the decisive steps to pursue Frederick into Prussia's heartland. The Austrian Feldmarshalleutnant Leopold Josef Graf Daun could have ended the war in October at Hochkirch, but he failed to follow up on his victory with a determined pursuit of Frederick's retreating army. This allowed Frederick time to recruit a new army over the winter.|$|E
25|$|In March 1949, he {{was arrested}} by the regime's secret police, the Securitate. The latter {{discovered}} his name while investigating the Bucharest connections of the armed resistance movement. Late in 1948, Tonegaru had obtained a Belgian Red Cross parcel for Teohar Mihadaş, a poet and {{former member of the}} fascist Iron Guard, who, unbeknown to his benefactor, had passed it on to an anti-communist fighter in his native Bistriţa. Caught up in the subsequent Securitate clampdown, Mihadaș was tortured until he implicated his connections. According to one account, the Securitate officers storming into Tonegaru's house treated him like a ringleader, and, having misinterpreted a piece of paper on which the poet had sketched <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> titled Pistolul lui Werther ("Werther's Gun"), pressed him to hand in his weapons, and repeatedly beat him with a crop.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the album's release, {{mainstream}} hip hop was dominated by West Coast hip hop. Enter the Wu-Tang (along with the critically acclaimed Illmatic and the commercial success of Ready to Die) was able to shift the emphasis away from the melodious, synthesizer-driven G-funk and restore interest into the East Coast hip hop scene. According to one columnist, [...] "When Enter the Wu-Tang: The 36 Chambers first graced the pages of rap lore in 1993, Dr. Dre's funk-filled, West Coast gangster rap dominated the business. Though this initial dominance was difficult to overcome, Wu-Tang still managed to carve <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of rap history." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{sick man}} begins {{to recover and}} Scully talks to him while the townspeople are gone. He {{does not seem to}} know who he is or how he arrived. She {{inspects}} his wound again and finds a lump moving along the man's spine; digging into the open wound, she pulls <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of a large worm. Scully talks with the hitchhiker, whose name is revealed to be Hank, about the creature and thinks she cannot get it out without killing him. Scully goes to find a car but, moments after leaving, Hank immediately tells the townspeople what she is up to and that [...] "another swap" [...] is needed. Concurrently, Doggett arrives in Utah and informs the Sheriff about a series of X-Files involving similar back wounds and death by stoning.|$|E
500|$|Originally the {{locomotive}} had a [...] "diamond" [...] smoke stack. It is unknown {{when that was}} changed to a straight [...] "shotgun" [...] stack. Sometime during the early 20th century {{the locomotive}} was converted from coal burning to oil burning and its wooden [...] "cowcatcher" [...] pilot was replaced with a steel pipe pilot. [...] The wooden cab was replaced with an all-steel cab, and its kerosene [...] "box" [...] headlamp was replaced with an electric one. [...] When the engine was relocated from Louisiana to Vermont its steel cab roof was removed {{in preparation for the}} ride on a flat car. [...] The roof was later mistaken for scrap metal as a worker at Steamtown cut <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> for use as a stack cover for the locomotive. [...] In 1970 the train underwent what the Steamtown Historical Study refers to as a [...] "misguided" [...] restoration, and given a diamond-shaped smoke stack and a kerosene [...] "box" [...] headlamp, both of which bearing very little resemblance to the stack and headlamp originally worn by the engine. [...] The restoration thus gave the engine an appearance unlike any form it had assumed during its service life.|$|E

Meanwhile, The Mysterious Man gives Milky White back to the Baker.|$|E
2500|$|Once the tedding {{process had}} finished, the hay {{was made into}} a ruck. In Boho, {{depending}} on the moisture of the ground, it was traditional to place some branches on the ground or [...] old hay to stop the bottom of the new ruck getting wet. The ruck was constructed by two or three people pitching up hay to a person on top of the ruck (sometimes a child) who tramped the hay down so that it was compact. When the ruck was high enough, usually the height of the person pitching the hay plus the length of their pitchfork, somebody would pull out the bottom circumference of the ruck and pitch that hay up on top as well. Two hay ropes made with a twister were usually thrown {{over the top of the}} ruck at right angles to each other and secured by pulling <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of hay at the bottom of the ruck and making another short attachment, so that the ropes and the bottom of the ruck could be connected. After this was done, the ruck would be [...] "dressed" [...] by raking down the outside so that water would run off the top during the rain. The surrounding ground was raked for hay, which was transferred over to the next ruck.|$|E
