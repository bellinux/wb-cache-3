40|$|Background. Institute of Pharmacy and Drug Research is a {{competent}} authority for post-licensing analytical control of medicines on their quality and safety on Slovenian market. Human blood products {{as a possible}} way for transmiting some viruses, represent potential danger for the donor pacient. Slovenian act on medicines classifies these products as risky medicines and put more strict postlicensing quality control prior to <b>release</b> of each <b>batch</b> on the market, so called a special quality control. Equally, human blood products in EU market are subjects to a more unitary post-licensing quality control and release procedure named the <b>Official</b> Control Authority <b>Batch</b> <b>Release</b> (OCABR procedure). Conclusions. In present article four years experiences on special quality control of human blood products on Slovenian market are presented. The most frequent reason for negative results after special control of human blood products is uncomplete documentation for every batch of the human blood products prior to its placement to the market. Other deficiences are classified into four major groups: disaccordances {{with the demands of}} Slovenian subsidary act, disaccordances with marketing authorisation dossier, disaccordances with the nomenclature and group of others deficiences and disaccordances. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractManufacturers of {{veterinary}} vaccines frequently incorporate animal-based <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> safety tests into their quality assurance monitoring protocols {{to meet their}} internal quality standards and to conform to government regulatory requirements. These tests are conducted by vaccinating target species animals or laboratory animals with a single dose or multiple doses of the test batch, and observing the vaccinated animals for signs of local or systemic adverse reactions. Manufacturers, standard-setting bodies, animal welfare advocacy groups, and regulatory agencies are actively investigating alternative methods to reduce their reliance on animal-based methods for <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> safety testing. Approaches which have been implemented or proposed include harmonizing technical requirements, developing in vitro tests, refining the existing animal tests, improving adverse reaction monitoring (vaccinovigilance), and improving manufacturing methods and quality controls to reduce batch-to-batch variability. An approach, known as the consistency approach, is increasingly being acknowledged as a potentially viable alternative to animal-based <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> tests for vaccines. This paper will {{provide an overview of}} currently utilized <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> safety tests for veterinary vaccines, the associated regulatory requirements, and some potentially acceptable alternative approaches for reducing, refining, and replacing the use of animals in these tests...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{main goal}} of {{wastewater}} treatment is to obtain high quality effluent. This study proposes a methodology to estimate in real-time the effluent quality in a biological nutrient removal (BNR) sequencing batch reactor (SBR) process. Results: This is achieved by: (i) detecting the batch quality; and (ii) predicting {{the classification of}} the release according to different effluent characteristics. A principal component analysis (PCA) model is built to discern normal or abnormal behavior of the <b>batch</b> <b>release.</b> An index is given to every phase of the process by means of contribution analysis, and a fault signature (FS) is created. The FS in a classification model {{is associated with a}} biological removal quality. Conclusion: The model is applied as a soft-sensor in real-time to new <b>batch</b> <b>releases</b> to obtain a qualitative estimate of the effluent. A correct estimation for the qualitative variables, of above 95 %, would provide a reliable tool to estimate BNR performances. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R
40|$|Current <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> {{testing of}} {{established}} vaccines emphasizes quality {{control of the}} final product and is often characterized by extensive use of animals. This report summarises the discussions of a joint ECVAM/EPAA workshop on {{the applicability of the}} consistency approach for routine release of human and veterinary vaccines and its potential to reduce animal use. The consistency approach is based upon thorough characterisation of the vaccine during development and the principle that the quality of subsequent batches is the consequence of the strict application of a quality system and of a consistent production of batches. The concept of consistency of production is state-of-the-art for new generation vaccines, where <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> is mainly based on non-animal methods.

40|$|Polyclonal and {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{are often}} used in regulatory testing of biologicals (vaccines and related prod-ucts). One {{of the most common}} applications for antibody-based immunoassays is as a <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> test. <b>Batch</b> <b>release</b> tests, whether they measure serological responses to vacci-nation or they quantify individual antigens by in vitro meth-ods, must provide an acceptable estimate of potency of an individual batch of vaccine. Thus, due consideration must be given to the type of antibody used or quantified in such assays. Differences in specificity and avidity may affect the utility of an assay as an indicator of potency; case examples are given to illustrate these concepts. Concerns associated with antigen quantification assays (e. g., reagent denatur-ation upon binding to solid substrates, and interference from nontarget antigens or additives in a complex vaccine) are also discussed. International efforts to harmonize test meth-ods in recent years have increased the importance of estab-lishing standardized antibodies.

40|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are pivotal in the {{induction}} of adaptive immune responses {{because they can}} activate naive T-cells. Moreover, they steer these adap-tive immune responses by integrating various stimuli, such as from different pathogen associated molecular patterns and the cytokine milieu. Immature DC are very well capable of ingesting protein antigens, whereas mature DC are effi-cient presenters of peptides to naive T cells. Human DC can be readily cultured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which are isolated from human blood. There is a strong need to moni-tor in a high-throughput fashion the immunogenicity of candidate vaccines {{during the process of}} vaccine develop-ment. Furthermore, regulators require efficacy and safety testing for <b>batch</b> <b>release.</b> For some vaccines, these tests require animal testing, causing pain and discomfort, which cannot be contested because it would interfere with the test results. With the aims of promoting vac-cine development and reducing the num-ber of animals for <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> testing, we propose to use more broadly human DC for vaccine immunogenicity testing. In this commentary, this proposition is illustrated by several examples in which the maturation of human DC was suc-cessfully used to test for vaccine and adjuvant immunogenicity...|$|R
40|$|Safety and potency {{assessment}} for <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> testing of established vaccines still relies partly on animal tests.

40|$|A Mg/Al layered double {{hydroxide}} (LDH) was intercalated {{with the}} anionic herbicides 2, 4 -D, MCPA, and picloram by using three different methodologies: (i) direct synthesis (DS), (ii) regeneration (RE), and (iii) ion exchange (IE). The resulting complexes were characterized and assayed by <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> and column leaching tests, aiming at the controlled release of these herbicides. All the tested LDH-herbicide complexes displayed similar slow herbicide release properties in water, although the IE method seemed {{to result in}} complexes with a greater fraction of herbicide in a readily available form. Apparently, the LDH-herbicide complexes released most of the active ingredient present in the complexes {{at the end of}} the <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> experiment. This was attributed to the replacement of the intercalated herbicide by carbonate and hydroxyl anions from the aqueous solution. Compared to the free herbicides, the application of the three LDH-herbicide complexes (RE) to soil columns resulted in reduction in the maximum herbicide concentration in leachates and led to the retardation of herbicide leaching through the soil. All LDH-herbicide complexes presented an herbicidal efficacy similar to that of the free (technical) herbicides. Our results indicated the potential applicability of LDHs as supports for the preparation of slow release formulations of acid herbicides such as 2, 4 -D, MCPA, or picloram. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Batch</b> (wave) <b>release</b> {{policies}} are prevalent in warehouses with an automated sorter, and take different forms {{depending on how}} <b>batches</b> <b>released</b> consecutively may overlap downstream in the sorter. Continuous (waveless) release constitutes an emerging alternative recently adopted by several firms. Although that new policy presents several advantages relative to waves, it requires more expensive technology and involves the possibility of congestion-induced collapse (gridlock) at the sorter. Using an extensive data set of detailed warehouse flow information from a leading U. S. online retailer, we first develop a model with validated predictive accuracy for a warehouse operating under waveless release. We then use that model to compute operational guidelines for dynamically managing the main control lever of that policy {{with the goal of}} maximizing throughput while keeping the risk of gridlock under a specified threshold. Second, we leverage that model and data set to compare the performance of wave-based and waveless policies through simulation. The best waveless policy yields larger or equal throughput than the best wave-based policy in all scenarios considered, and thus appears to merit some consideration by practitioners. inventory theory and control, production planning and scheduling, dynamic programming, queueing theory, simulation...|$|R
