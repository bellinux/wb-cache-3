500|$|At {{the press}} conference in Hamburg, I was asked if Michael, Eve and Lucifer were {{historical}} figures {{of the past and}} I answered that they exist now, for example Lucifer in New York. In my work, I have defined Lucifer as the cosmic spirit of rebellion, of anarchy. He uses his high degree of intelligence to destroy creation. He does not know love. After further questions about the events in America, I said that such a plan appeared to be Lucifer's greatest work of art. Of course I used the designation [...] "work of art" [...] to mean the work of destruction personified in Lucifer. In the context <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>other</b> comments this was unequivocal.|$|E

[...] Norris, who has played several cops before in film and television, stated: Having played so many cops, I've talked with a lot of technical advisers, so I've been able to pick up a lot. Coincidentally, {{one of my best friends}} growing up is a cop in Chicago, and one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>other</b> best friends out in LA is a sheriff.

[...] The Reggio Calabria Airport, near his birthplace, was named after Minniti and still bears his name.

It is preserved in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome.|$|E

He stated in an early 1960s interview with the Mainichi Newspaper, [...] "But my movie company has produced a very interesting script that combined King Kong and Godzilla, so I couldn't help working on this instead <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>other</b> fantasy films. The script is special to me; it makes me emotional because it was King Kong that got me interested in the world of special photographic techniques when I saw it in 1933." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early 1976, Mitchell {{traveled}} with {{friends who were}} driving cross country to Maine. Afterwards, she drove back to California alone and composed several songs during her journey which featured on her next album, 1976's Hejira. She stated that [...] "This album was written mostly while I was traveling in the car. That's why there were no piano songs..." [...] Hejira was arguably Mitchell's most experimental album so far, due to her ongoing collaborations with jazz virtuoso bass guitarist Jaco Pastorius on several songs, namely the first single, [...] "Coyote", the atmospheric [...] "Hejira", the disorienting, guitar-heavy [...] "Black Crow", and the album's last song [...] "Refuge of the Roads". The album climbed to No. 13 on the Billboard Charts, reaching gold status three weeks after release, and received airplay from album oriented FM rock stations. Yet [...] "Coyote", backed with [...] "Blue Motel Room", failed to chart on the Hot 100. Hejira [...] "did not sell as briskly as Mitchell's earlier, more [...] "radio friendly" [...] albums, [...] its stature in her catalogue has grown over the years". Mitchell herself believes the album to be unique. In 2006 she said, [...] "I suppose {{a lot of people}} could have written a lot <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>other</b> songs, but I feel the songs on Hejira could only have come from me." ...|$|E
