40|$|International audienceIn many {{research}} domains, studies need to {{be addressed}} in a multidisciplinary manner: each expert deals with a particular aspect of the problem.

For this, an easily-understandable knowledge model for any raw data source, statistical <b>operator,</b> <b>indicator</b> or business process to be available for experts, is needed. In this paper, we propose a goal-oriented meta-model, to index and reuse treatments and an extension of existing semantic Web standards to index goal-oriented services and assist and/or automate their selection.

The literature review covered the history of charters including their founders, characteristics, and growth patterns. The data items used in the analyses were downloaded from the 2007 - 2008 Academic Excellence Indicator System (AEIS), which contains a variety of data from all Texas public schools. Multiple statistical analyses were utilized including chi-square, ANOVA, multiple regression and discriminate analysis. In order to evaluate Texas standard AP open enrollment charter campuses, their accountability ratings were compared with those of standard AP traditional public school campuses. The research evaluated twelve independent variables for charter schools to determine their relationship to accountability ratings, thereby providing charter <b>operators</b> <b>indicators</b> or predictors of accountability ratings to facilitate better academic quality.

Nevertheless, the maximum average fraction y_I of infected nodes in both SIS and SIR can be written as a quadratic form of the graph's Laplacian.

We focus on correlation functions containing twist operators, combining these with anchored loops, boundaries with SLE processes and with double SLE processes.

The collection of c= 0 logarithmic CFT operators that we use deriving the winding probabilities is novel, highlighting a potential incompatibility caused by the presence of two distinct logarithmic partners to the stress tensor within the theory.

40|$|ABSTRACT Governments and {{companies}} are continually {{faced with a}} challenge to effectively manage all risks so as to protect their assets, financial health, property, reputation, constituents, and natural resources. “Risk management is the decision-making process whereby a policy or regulation is developed after a risk has been identified and is integrated with other issues including political, social, historical, and economic factors” (Zondi, 2000). In South Africa, environmental risk (i. e. risks associated with environmental damage and compliance) in waste management is currently considered {{in the setting of}} standards for landfill siting, design and water quality monitoring. It is the author’s opinion that this current approach has been poorly managed because potential sources of major environmental liability have not been identified and quantified (DWAF, 1998). Environmental liability is defined as the obligation to compensate or restore the environmental damage caused by the past, use, release, or threatened release of a particular substance; or by other activities that adversely affect the environment and/or human health (ICMA, 2001). The author looks at a case study of a landfill in Johannesburg highlighting their implementation of the water quality monitoring plan and proposes that the monitoring plan be integrated into a proposed environmental liability and risk management approach to managing ground water pollution from landfill sites. As not every landfill {{is the same as the}} other, a comprehensive analysis as stated in the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) Minimum Requirements (1998) is used to gather a list of relevant parameters for that landfill. The comprehensive analysis constitutes macro-constituents and all other constituents likely to be present in quantities higher than the normal background values or to contaminate the groundwater storage (aquifer) in the future. Once done, the landfill operator can then discuss with the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEAT) on how to prioritise the parameters. They would also decide which parameters are to be used for the regular indicator analysis when monitoring because of cost reasons. All the parameters above background value are to be used as environmental liability parameters for that landfill site. The indicator analysis constitutes measurement of the most likely parameters that would, at an early stage, indicate the possibility of groundwater pollution. It is to be used in the regular monitoring exercises at the landfill by the <b>operator.</b> If an <b>indicator</b> parameter exceeds standards, a full comprehensive analysis must be performed and reported to DEAT. Each environmental liability parameter will be assigned a penalty charge and weight depending on a number of factors including: • Location of the landfill i. e. distance to acquifer and GW level • Geology of area • Type of aquifer • Type of landfill i. e. General of Hazardous • Risk level of that parameter to human health i. e. Health Risk Assessment The author proposes the introduction of an environmental liability costs fund with a compulsory monthly fee, which will be set up by both the landfill operator and the relevant government department. The water quality monitoring protocol will not differ much from the present structure. If pollution is shown during detection monitoring and a further detailed investigation indicates that exposure is higher than allowable limits, then a combined environmental liability penalty will be evaluated and the monetary value will be charged into the landfill operator’s account in the liability costs fund, although the landfill operator and DEAT can decide to use another method to determine the environmental liability e. g. liability insurance assessors. If the penalty required exceeds what has been accumulated in the liability fund account, then the difference will be demanded directly from the landfill operator. If the quarterly monitoring reports compiled by the operators show no mitigation claims into the liability find then the money accumulates in their account and a certain percentage will be paid back to the landfill operator as an incentive...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Developing an {{approach}} that delivers improved environmental performance for metal cycles is {{the aim of this}} thesis. Integral to the sustainable use of metals is the need to reduce environmental impacts associated with the mining, refining and recycling activities that supply metal to the economy. Currently, the links between the location and duration of these activities, their resultant impacts and the responsible parties are poorly characterised. Consequently, the changes to technology infrastructure and material flow patterns that are required to achieve sustainable metal cycles remain unclear to both industry and government actors. To address this problem, a holistic two-part methodology is developed. Firstly, a reference schema is developed to address the complexity of structuring analyses of the material chain at different geographical and time scales. The schema identifies actors and system variables at each scale of analysis and guides the level of information detail and performance indicators to be used in material chain characterisation. Material chain characterisation involves modelling material and energy flows for current activities as a series of connected nodes and linking these flows to resultant environmental impacts. The approach identifies the material chain activity responsible for each environmental impact and makes trade-offs between impacts explicit. Sensitivity analysis of the models identifies the key variables that enhance performance. The influence of actors over these variables is assessed to target areas for improvement. This first part of the methodology is illustrated using case studies that assess the current performance of copper material chain configurations at different geographical scales within the reference schema. The analysis of global material and energy flows indicates that the majority of environmental burden in the copper material chain is attributable to primary refining of metal from ore. Modelling of the dominant primary refining technologies using region-specific information for ore grade, technology mix and energy mix reveals that the total environmental impact differs by factors of 2 – 10 between world regions. The study of refined copper imports to Europe from various regions outside of Europe reveals that lower global warming impacts are achieved at the expense of increased local impacts from the producing regions. Overall, only limited improvements are possible without investing in new technology infrastructure. Evaluation of an innovative copper refining technology finds that collaboration with clean energy suppliers reduces global warming impacts more than changing process design parameters. To better assess the local impacts that are directly controllable by the technology <b>operator,</b> a new <b>indicator</b> incorporating the stability of solid waste is developed. In {{the second part of the}} methodology, the link established between actors, their control over key system variables and resultant impacts is used to design preferred future configurations for the material chain. Dynamic models are developed to evaluate transition paths towards preferred futures for individual and collaborative action by industry in the context of externally changing variables (for example, increasing demand for copper and declining available ore grades). Both new copper technology infrastructure and new material flow patterns are assessed in transitions toward preferred futures for a case study of the United States. The improvements resulting from the introduction of new primary refining technology by individual actors are negated by increasing impacts from declining copper ore grades over time. Achieving a combined reduction in local and global environmental impacts requires collaboration between industry actors to immediately increase the recycling of secondary scrap. Significantly, this methodology links actor decisions with their impacts across scales to prompt accountability for current performance and guide useful collaborations between actors. The methodology then delivers a comprehensive assessment of the scale and timing of required interventions to achieve more sustainable metal cycles...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{initiate}} a validation process of the Norwegian Index for Emergency Medical Assistance (Index). Before we could do that, however, we had to explore to which extent the Index actually {{is used by the}} Norwegian emergency medical communication centres (EMCCs). The Index is the emergency medical dispatch guidelines used by operators at EMCC when they receive and handle calls at the emergency medical line. In Norway, 113 is the specific toll-free line for medical emergencies. The Index was developed in 1994, and is now available in the 3 rd edition (2009). All EMCCs and a majority of the local emergency medical communication centres (LEMCs) in Norway claim to use the Index upon receipt of 113 calls. In 2010, knowledge on the epidemiology of 113 calls was non-existing. Criteria-based dispatch guidelines are designed to be used in close cooperation with experienced health educated EMCC operators, and the operators are intended to bring their knowledge, experience and skill into the assessment process. This has complicated past research, as {{it is difficult to determine}} whether the determined criteria code or dispatched response is due to the guidelines themselves, the operator’s own assessment or a combination of both. In addition, the Index is still paper-based, so that its use remains unable to track. After the initial mapping of the place, situation and the patient’s vital functions found on the start page, the rest of the Index criteria cards are symptom-based. This makes it challenging to compare specific Index criteria codes with specific discharge diagnoses from hospitals, as a measure on Index validity. Criteria card “ 27 Altered levels of consciousness – paralysis”, specifically the criteria codes A. 27. 03 – 06, was considered comparable to the diagnosis of stroke, including intracerebral haemorrhage, acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack. The objectives of the individual studies were to gain more knowledge about: 	 The 113 epidemiology in Norway 	 Use of the Index by the EMCCs 	 The Index’s validity in identification and prediction of stroke Study 1 was a cross-sectional survey of all 113 -enquiries to the 19 EMCCs during a 72 -hour period in August 2011. The final material consisted of 2 298 printouts from the electronic EMCC records, Emergency medical information system (AMIS), and contained information about time, caller, patient, Index criteria code, response and resources allocation. The national mean 113 contact rate was 56 / 1 000 population per year, but the variation among the different EMCCs was from 33 to 114. The acute contact rate was 21 / 1 000 per year, with a variation of 5 to 31. Urgency distribution showed 37 % acute, 34 % urgent and 27 % non-urgent contacts. The most frequently used Index criteria card was “ 06 Unclear problem”, which was used in 20 % of the contacts, with a variation of 10 to 42 % among the EMCCs. Study 2 was a national questionnaire study to all EMCC operators, to explore selfreported use of the Index. The questionnaire contained questions about use of the Index, education, EMCC experience, and training in, and repetition on the use of the Index at their workplace. Response rate was 63. 4 %, and the typical operator among the respondents was a female registered nurse with six years of EMCC experience, who worked in rotation with either the emergency department or ambulance. Mean self-reported use of the Index was calculated to be 3. 95, corresponding to the response format 4 = “often, > 75 %”. Rotation with ambulance reduced use of the Index, while experienced focus on use of the Index at workplace increased the use. The operators checked whether the patient was conscious or not in 93 % of the calls, but claimed to use the start page in only 47 %. Availability of the electronic AMIS was the most frequent stated reason for not using the start page or the Index as a whole. Study 3 was a review of the audio logs from the same time period as Study 1, to assess use of the Index in an objective manner, and then see if the guideline adherence affected the emergency medical dispatch (EMD) response interval. Seven EMCCs participated, with a total of 299 randomized calls, 174 acute and 125 urgent. The EMCC selection was strategic, based on variation in size, geographical location, various health trusts, and the EMCCs’ mean self-reported use of the Index from Study 2. The listening form measured whether and how fast the <b>operator</b> got various <b>indicators</b> on use of the Index confirmed. The indicators “location”, “consciousness” and “criteria compliance” were combined in an overall guideline adherence variable, where 0 indicated no guideline adherence and 3 the maximum guideline adherence. Mean guideline adherence was 2. 41, equivalent to 80 % of the maximum score. EMD response interval increased with decreased guideline adherence score. Study 4 was a retrospective registry study comparing patients with EMCC stroke suspect criteria codes and patients with hospital stroke diagnoses. The material consisted of AMIS-printouts from Bergen EMCC, and patient data from Haukeland University Hospital, Haraldsplass Diaconal Hospital and Voss Hospital. Less than half of the confirmed stroke patients’ initial EMCC contact was via 113 line, 52 % of the patients were in contact with the primary health care services first. By combining patient data from the stroke database at Haukeland University Hospital and the 113 - data from Bergen EMCC, we calculated sensitivity for stroke identification at EMCC contact of 57. 9 %, specificity of 99. 1 %, positive predictive value (PPV) of 45. 7 % and negative predictive value (NPV) of 99. 4 %. Stroke patients whom initial EMCC contact was via the 113 line had a higher proportion of acute responses and stroke suspect criteria codes. Although the majority of stroke patients who came in contact with the EMCC via primary health care services did not receive stroke suspect criteria codes, 85 % of these calls had free-text notes addressing stroke suspicion. Main findings: 	 The national mean 113 contact rate was 56 / 1 000 a year, but the individual contact rates for the different EMCCs varied between 33 and 114. The urgency distribution was 37 % acute, 34 % urgent and 27 % non-urgent contacts. Index criteria card “ 06 Unclear problem” was the most frequently used, used in between 10 and 42 % of the contacts among the different EMCCs. 	 Self-reported use of the Index by the operators was > 75 %. Working in rotation, with shifts at both the EMCC and the ambulance service, was associated with reduced use of the Index, while focus on use of the Index at the EMCC increased use. AMIS was the most frequent stated reason for not using the Index. 	 Measured mean guideline adherence was 80 % of the maximum score. Low guideline adherence score correlated with longer EMD response interval. 	 The Index’s ability to identify or predict stroke patients is modest, with a sensitivity of 57. 9 %, specificity of 99. 1 %, PPV of 45. 7 % and NPV of 99. 4 %. More than half of the stroke patients initially contacted primary health care services instead of 113. </p...|$|R
