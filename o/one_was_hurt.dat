5|$|In the 1980s Adkins again {{found himself}} {{in trouble with the}} law. In 1983 he was living with his girlfriend who was still a minor. Her mother {{reported}} to police that she had been raped, and Adkins was subsequently charged with third-degree sexual assault, although the girl insisted the sexual acts were consensual. In October the same year, another relationship ended with jail time, when a shootout occurred between Adkins and a jealous husband. No <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt,</b> but Adkins was charged with felony illegal possession of a shotgun and spent five months in jail.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{moved to}} a small island in the Bahamas called White Cay for the {{beginning}} and end of the Isla Cruces battle, before production took a break until August, where in Los Angeles the interiors of the Flying Dutchman were shot. On September 18, 2005, the crew moved to Grand Bahama Island to shoot ship exteriors, including the working Black Pearl and Flying Dutchman. Filming there was a tumultuous period, starting with the fact that the tank had not actually been finished. The hurricane season caused many pauses in shooting, and Hurricane Wilma damaged many of the accessways and pumps, though no <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> nor were any of the ships destroyed. Filming completed on September 10, 2005.|$|E
5|$|In {{their last}} year in Minneapolis, the Lakers went 25–50. On January 18, 1960, the team was coming off a loss and {{traveling}} to St. Louis when their plane crash-landed. Snow storms had driven the pilot 150 miles off course when {{he was forced to}} land in a cornfield. No <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt.</b> Their record earned them the number two pick in the 1960 NBA draft. The team selected Jerry West from West Virginia University. During the 1960 off-season, the Lakers became the NBA's first West Coast team when owner Bob Short decided to move the team to Los Angeles. Led by Baylor's 34.8ppg and 19.8rpg, Los Angeles won 11 more than the year before in West's first season. On November 15 that season, Baylor set a new NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks while grabbing 25 rebounds. In doing so, Baylor broke his own NBA record of 64 points. Despite a losing record, the Lakers made the playoffs. They came within two points of the NBA Finals when they lost in game seven of their second round series against St. Louis.|$|E

5|$|Sunday, August 24, 1924, was a {{warm summer}} day in Brooklyn, and Helen Palsgraf, a 40-year-old janitor and housekeeper, was taking her two daughters, Elizabeth and Lillian, aged 15 and 12, to Rockaway Beach. Having paid the {{necessary}} fare, {{they were on the}} platform at the East New York station of the LIRR on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, when a train, not theirs, pulled in. As it began to move again, two men raced for the train, and one made it without incident, as the doors had not closed. The other, a man carrying a package, leapt aboard, {{with the help of a}} platform guard pushing him from behind as a member of the train's crew pulled him into the car. But in the process, the man lost the package, which dropped and exploded, for it apparently contained fireworks. Either the force of the explosion or the panicking of those on the platform caused a tall, coin-operated scale to topple onto Helen Palsgraf. No <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> enough to spend the night in the hospital, though several people, Palsgraf among them, were listed as injured.|$|E

60|$|I wiped {{something}} that trickled {{from my face}} and {{was shocked to see}} my hand covered with blood. I looked at myself and saw what seemed to me an astonishing quantity of blood running down my arm and shoulder. I perceived my mouth was full of blood. It's a queer moment when <b>one</b> realises <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>hurt,</b> and perhaps badly hurt, and has still to discover just how far <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>hurt.</b> I explored my face carefully and found unfamiliar contours on the left side. The broken end of a branch had driven right through my cheek, damaging my cheek and teeth and gums, and left a splinter of itself stuck, like an explorer's fartherest-point flag, in the upper maxillary. That and a sprained wrist were all my damage. But I bled as though I had been chopped to pieces, {{and it seemed to me}} that my face had been driven in. I can't describe just the horrible disgust I felt at that.|$|R
