5|$|The {{defensive}} play of Taylor, Oliver, and Johnson greatly {{affected the}} course of the game and is apparent in Georgia's time <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> and average starting position in each of the quarters. During the first and second quarters, Georgia had average starting positions on their own 19and26-yard lines, respectively. Their first-quarter time <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> was just 5:41, and their second-quarter possession time was 6:34. During the third and fourth quarters, when all four Virginia Tech turnovers took place, Georgia's time <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> jumped to 10:41 and 7:47, respectively. In the third quarter, their average starting possession gained tenyards to the Georgia 36, and during the final quarter, their average starting position was the Virginia Tech 36-yard line. This fact allowed Georgia to capitalize on the Virginia Tech turnovers, turning them into points on the scoreboard.|$|E

5|$|In {{the event}} that the Court {{rejected}} the argument that Pedra Branca was terra nullius in 1847, Singapore contended that the selection of Pedra Branca as the site for Horsburgh Lighthouse and the construction of the lighthouse between 1847 and 1851 constituted a taking <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> of the island à titre de souverain (with the title of a sovereign). The British Crown obtained title over the island in accordance with legal principles governing the acquisition of territory at that time. This title was maintained by the United Kingdom and its lawful successor, the Republic of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Maryland had {{previously}} shown {{an ability to}} strike quickly on offense and did so again in the game. In the 2008 season, the team scored 18out of 28touchdowns in drives consisting of six or fewer plays or {{less than two minutes}} of game time. This led to the team often trailing opponents in time <b>of</b> <b>possession.</b> In the Humanitarian Bowl, Maryland continued the pattern by scoring in the first 1:01 with a 59-yard Chris Turner pass to Adrian Cannon. Maryland also possessed the ball for 2:26 less than Nevada.|$|E

5|$|New York won the {{following}} week against Minnesota before facing the Buffalo Bills in their regular season home finale. Despite holding a significant advantage in time <b>of</b> <b>possession,</b> they lost 17–13, for their third loss in four games.

His replacement, Jeff Hostetler, was an unproven career backup, who had thrown a mere 68 passes coming into the season.|$|E

5|$|Over {{two-thirds of}} Kansas' offense {{came through the}} air as the Jayhawks racked up 249net passing yards. The Hokies, meanwhile, earned almost half their offense on the ground. The end result of the varying {{offensive}} strategies was much the same, however. Kansas successfully converted six of its 17third-down attempts, while Virginia Tech converted seven of its 17attempts. The time <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> was one key stat in favor of Kansas, as Kansas controlled the ball for 33:47, over 7 minutes more than Virginia Tech's possession time of 26:13.|$|E
5|$|Under {{new head}} coach Jim Caldwell, Manning started the 2009 {{season with a}} victory by {{throwing}} for 301 yards.

Manning was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month {{for the fourth time}} in his career in September. Against the Seattle Seahawks Manning passed for 353 yards and two touchdowns for his fourth consecutive 300-yard passing game set a new franchise record.|$|E
5|$|Although Captain Edward Edwards {{discovered}} the atoll in 1791, Ducie {{was not considered}} a British possession. In 1867 Ducie was claimed by the United States under the Guano Islands Act, which established that an uninhabited territory with guano deposits could be claimed as a US possession, {{so long as it}} was unclaimed by any other country. Despite claims on several other territories, based on various documents such as the Guano Islands Act, neither the United States nor the United Kingdom recognised the sovereignty claimed by each other. Neither of the two considered that the mere discovery of an island was sufficient to claim sovereignty over it, and often a formal act <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> was considered the proper procedure to claim rights over a territory. Ultimately, the United States did not assert its sovereignty over most of its claimed territories.|$|E

5|$|At home {{in front}} of 75,321 fans, the Giants played the Washington Redskins in Week 8. Each team totaled 16 first downs, four punts and five penalties, and the {{difference}} in time <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> was less than one minute. However, the Giants committed no turnovers while coercing three from the Redskins. Giants cornerback Everson Walls intercepted two passes—including one that he returned for his first career touchdown—and free safety Greg Jackson intercepted another. Walls' interception set up a Giants touchdown and a 14–0 lead in the second quarter. Jackson then intercepted a pass {{in the end zone}} in the third quarter to preserve a 14–10 lead, and Walls returned his second interception 28yards for a touchdown that made the score 21–10 and put the game of reach in the fourth quarter.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-final, Chelsea faced local rivals Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley. The {{first half}} was even, {{with both sides}} enjoying long spells <b>of</b> <b>possession,</b> until Didier Drogba put Chelsea ahead just before the break. Chelsea scored {{at the start of}} the second half. However, Juan Mata's goal that did not appear to cross the line, but referee Martin Atkinson awarded the goal. Gareth Bale put Tottenham back in it with a goal shortly after a Petr Čech {{challenge}} on Emmanuel Adebayor. Despite the goal, Tottenham never took control of the game and Ramires scored in the 77th minute, followed minutes later by a Frank Lampard free kick, and a Florent Malouda strike in the fourth minute of added time. This secured Chelsea's place in their first FA Cup Final since their 2010 triumph over Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|In {{what would}} turn out to be a preview of Super Bowl XXV, the Giants lost at home to the Buffalo Bills 17–13 in Week 15. The game was played in inclement weather, which caused 10,295 no-shows at Giants Stadium. They led the Bills in total yards (313 to 264), rushing yards (157 to 65), first downs (20 to 13) and time <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> (37:59 to 22:01), but lost nonetheless. Simms broke his foot during the game, causing him to miss the {{remainder}} of the season, and was replaced by Jeff Hostetler, who had engineered the Giants' Week 7 fourth-quarter comeback against Phoenix. The Bills built a 14–10 second quarter lead behind 74- and 78-yard touchdown drives. The teams alternated field goals to make the score 17–13. However, the Giants could not score in the fourth quarter despite mounting drives to the Bills' 18 and 23yard lines. This was Lionel Manuel's last game as a Giant, as he was waived afterwards.|$|E
