40|$|A new {{computer}} program named CutLHCO is introduced, whose function is {{the implementation of}} generic data selection cuts on collider event specification files in the standardized. lhco format. This software is intended to fill an open market niche for a lightweight yet flexible "consumer-level" alternative to the ROOT data analysis framework. The primary envisioned application is as a filter on output produced by the PGS 4 and DELPHES detector simulations, which are themselves lightweight alternatives to the GEANT 4 based solutions favored by the large LHC experiments. All process control instructions are provided via a compact and powerful <b>card</b> <b>file</b> input syntax that efficiently facilitates the reasonable approximation of most event selection strategies and specialized discovery statistics commonly employed by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations. The structure, function, invocation and usage {{of the most recent}} CutLHCO 2. 0 program version are documented thoroughly, including a detailed deconstruction of several example <b>card</b> <b>file</b> specifications.

Thus, it is required the deployment of profile management systems enabling the reliable creation and efficient management of enriched user profiles. Toward to this effort, in this paper, we propose a smart <b>card</b> <b>file</b> system design for the user healthcare smart cards incorporated in a healthcare profile management system applying in a typical ubiquitous healthcare system.

Mindful of the criticisms of the recent investigation into the Yorkshire Ripper, which had become overwhelmed due to the volume of information <b>filed</b> in a <b>card</b> <b>filing</b> system, one of Clark's first decisions upon taking overall charge of the murder investigation was to introduce computer technology into the investigation; he and other senior officers agreed that {{the most efficient way}} to cooperate in an investigation of this scope was to collate their information on the Hogg murder into a computerised database, which all forces involved in the manhunt could access.

30|$|A {{series of}} {{comparative}} experiments {{have also been}} carried out. In any case, the pH is adjusted in the solution without TGA; the chalcopyrite nor wurtzite CuInS 2 can be synthesized. The synthesized products both in the acidic and alkaline environment are CuS (JCPDS <b>card</b> <b>file</b> no. 06 - 0464) and In(OH) 3 (JCPDS <b>card</b> <b>file</b> no. 76 - 1464) (Additional file 1 : Figure S 3). It {{is due to the}} reason that the Cu 2 + cannot be reduced to Cu+ in the solution in the absence of TGA, and CuS is generated when the Na 2 S is added. Simultaneously, Na 2 S is a strong alkaline compound; as a result, In(OH) 3 is also formed. The comparative experiment also indicates that TGA plays a crucial role for the formation of CuInS 2 because of its complexation and reducibility [20, 21].|$|R
