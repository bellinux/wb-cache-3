5|$|In music, {{noise is}} {{variously}} described as unpitched, indeterminate, uncontrolled, loud, unmusical, or unwanted sound. Noise {{is an important}} component of the sound of the human voice and all musical instruments, particularly in unpitched percussion instruments and electric guitars (using distortion). Electronic instruments create various colours <b>of</b> <b>noise.</b> Traditional uses <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> are unrestricted, using all the frequencies associated with pitch and timbre, such as the white noise component of a drum roll on a snare drum, or the transients present in the prefix of the sounds of some organ pipes.|$|E

5|$|Auditory camouflage, {{at least}} in the form <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> reduction, is practised in various ways. The {{rubberized}} hull of military submarines absorbs sonar waves and {{can be seen as a}} form of auditory camouflage. Some modern helicopters are designed to be quiet. Combat uniforms are usually equipped with buttons rather than snap fasteners or velcro to reduce noise.|$|E
5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> is called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> will be omitted here.|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: The {{expressive}} {{speech of}} Thai had been studied {{for a short}} period of time. An important feature of speech was fundamental frequency (F 0) which defines the human speech prosody. It could be used to distinguish the difference between several types of expressive speech. The environmental noises affect the F 0 contour for Thai dialects as concluded in the previous study. The study prosodic information of Thai speech with various speaking styles and several types <b>of</b> <b>noises</b> had not been conducted. Approach: Four different types of speaking styles were used; meanwhile four types <b>of</b> environmental <b>noises</b> were recorded with different levels of power. They were subsequently mixed together. The F 0 contours from different types of speaking styles, different types <b>of</b> <b>noises</b> and different levels <b>of</b> <b>noises</b> were extracted. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the F 0 contour of clean speech and the noise-corrupted speech was calculated. Results: In the experiments, four types <b>of</b> <b>noises</b> were included train, factory, car and air conditioner. Each type of speaking style included 10 samples of 10 utterances of male and female speech. Five levels <b>of</b> <b>noises</b> were varied from 0 - 20 dB compared with the clean speech. It could be notified that the effects of distinguishing types <b>of</b> <b>noises</b> were different. Four different types of speaking styles were also caused the differences in RMSEs. Conclusion: The recorded noises deteriorate the F 0 contours for all types of speaking styles in Thai...|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} aspect {{of all of these}} examples <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> in European keyboard and string music before the 19th century is that they are used as sound effects in programme music. Sounds that would likely cause offense in other musical contexts are made acceptable by their illustrative function.

5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} used {{in many of the}} same {{applications}} as lumped element filters, such as selectivity of radio channel, bandlimiting <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> and multiplexing of many signals into one channel. Distributed element filters may be constructed to have any of the bandforms possible with lumped elements (low-pass, band-pass, etc.) with the exception of high-pass, which is usually only approximated. All filter classes used in lumped element designs (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) can be implemented using a distributed element approach.|$|E
5|$|From 1920 John Carson, {{also working}} for AT, {{began to develop}} a new way of looking at signals using the {{operational}} calculus of Heaviside which in essence is working in the frequency domain. This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel to invent many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished many of the old ideas. For instance the old telegraph engineers thought of the signal as being a single frequency and this idea persisted into the age of radio with some still believing that frequency modulation (FM) transmission could be achieved with a smaller bandwidth than the baseband signal right up until the publication of Carson's 1922 paper. Another advance concerned the nature <b>of</b> <b>noise,</b> Carson and Zobel (1923) treated noise as a random process with a continuous bandwidth, an idea that was well ahead of its time, and thus limited the amount <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> {{that it was possible to}} remove by filtering to that part of the noise spectrum which fell outside the passband. This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with wide-band FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry Nyquist whose thermal noise power formula is well known today.|$|E

The service was discontinued after three return flights because <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> complaints from the Malaysian government; it could only be reinstated on a new route bypassing Malaysian airspace in 1979. A dispute with India prevented Concorde from reaching supersonic speeds in Indian airspace, so the route was eventually declared not viable and discontinued in 1980.|$|E

The system, called HALOsonic Internal and External Electronic Sound Synthesis, is a suite <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> solutions that uses patented technologies from Lotus and Harman International. The audio system generates engine sounds inside the vehicle through the audio system. The system also generates the external sound through speakers mounted at {{the front and rear}} to provide a warning to increase pedestrian safety. The system comes with four driver-selectable engine sounds, two of which have been designed to have characteristics of a multi-cylinder conventional V6 and V12 engine.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{truncation}} spurs can {{be reduced}} substantially {{by the introduction of}} white gaussian noise prior to truncation. The so-called dither noise is summed into the lower W+1 bits of the PA output word to linearize the truncation operation. Often the improvement can be achieved without penalty because the DAC noise floor tends to dominate system performance. Amplitude truncation spurs can not be mitigated in this fashion. Introduction <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> into the static values held in the PAC ROMs would not eliminate the cyclicality of the truncation error terms and thus would not achieve the desired effect.|$|E
