25|$|Input {{and output}} {{impedances}} of a negative-feedback amplifier (closed-loop amplifier) become {{sensitive to the}} gain of an amplifier without feedback (open-loop amplifier)—that exposes these impedances to variations in the <b>open-loop</b> <b>gain,</b> for example, due to parameter variations or nonlinearity of the <b>open-loop</b> <b>gain.</b>|$|E
25|$|Finite gain: <b>Open-loop</b> <b>gain</b> is {{infinite}} in {{the ideal}} operational amplifier but finite in real operational amplifiers. Typical devices exhibit open-loop DC gain ranging from 100,000 to over 1 million. So {{long as the}} loop gain (i.e., the product of open-loop and feedback gains) is very large, the circuit gain will be determined entirely {{by the amount of}} negative feedback (i.e., it will be independent of <b>open-loop</b> <b>gain).</b> In cases where closed-loop gain must be very high, the feedback gain will be very low, and the low feedback gain causes low loop gain; in these cases, the operational amplifier will cease to behave ideally.|$|E
25|$|Below, {{the voltage}} gain of the {{amplifier}} with feedback, the closed-loop gain AFB, is derived {{in terms of}} the gain of the amplifier without feedback, the <b>open-loop</b> <b>gain</b> AOL and the feedback factor β, which governs how much of the output signal is applied to the input (see Figure 1). The <b>open-loop</b> <b>gain</b> AOL in general may be a function of both frequency and voltage; the feedback parameter β is determined by the feedback network that is connected around the amplifier. For an operational amplifier, two resistors forming a voltage divider may be used for the feedback network to set β between 0 and 1. This network may be modified using reactive elements like capacitors or inductors to (a) give frequency-dependent closed-loop gain as in equalization/tone-control circuits or (b) construct oscillators. The gain of the amplifier with feedback is derived below {{in the case of a}} voltage amplifier with voltage feedback.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{phase-locked loop}} (PLL) and delay-locked loop (DLL) design with adaptively {{adjusting}} bandwidth enables optimal performance {{over a wide}} frequency range and across process, voltage, and temperature variations. A design methodology of such adaptive-bandwidth PLLs and DLLs is described. To {{assess the impact of}} each circuit parameter directly, we derive a discrete-time, open-loop dynamic model of the PLL/DLL that characterizes the change in output variables in response to the sampled error and we express the adaptive-bandwidth criteria in terms of the <b>open-loop</b> <b>gains,</b> instead of the traditional closed-loop parameters, and. Applying these criteria, we derive scaling equations for the charge-pump current and filter resistance that achieve adaptive bandwidth in charge-pump PLL/DLLs. We show that previously published adaptive-bandwidth PLL/DLLs, a self-biased PLL/DLL and a regulated-supply PLL/DLL, rely on the small-signal conductance tracking the large-signal conductance of the voltage-controlled oscillator/voltage-controlled delay-line and, thus, sustain constant �� � and only if the voltage swing is sufficiently higher than the device threshold voltage „r.

5000|$|The output {{signals of}} all {{amplifiers}} exhibit a time delay {{when compared to}} their input signals. This delay causes a phase difference between the amplifier's input and output signals. If there are enough stages in the amplifier, at some frequency, the output signal will lag behind the input signal by one cycle period at that frequency. In this situation, the amplifier's output signal will be in phase with its input signal though lagging behind it by 360°, i.e., the output will have a phase angle of &minus;360°. This lag is of great consequence in amplifiers that use feedback. The reason: the amplifier will oscillate if the fed-back output signal is in phase with the input signal at the frequency at which its <b>open-loop</b> voltage <b>gain</b> equals its closed-loop voltage <b>gain</b> and the <b>open-loop</b> voltage <b>gain</b> is one or greater. The oscillation will occur because the fed-back output signal will then reinforce the input signal at that frequency. [...] In conventional operational amplifiers, the critical output phase angle is &minus;180° because the output is fed back to the input through an inverting input which adds an additional &minus;180°.|$|R
2500|$|Feedback voltage {{regulators}} operate {{by comparing the}} actual output voltage to some fixed reference voltage. Any difference is amplified and used to control the regulation element {{in such a way}} as to reduce the voltage error. This forms a negative feedback control loop; increasing the <b>open-loop</b> <b>gain</b> tends to increase regulation accuracy but reduce stability. (Stability is avoidance of oscillation, or ringing, during step changes.) There will also be a trade-off between stability and the speed of the response to changes. [...] If the output voltage is too low (perhaps due to input voltage reducing or load current increasing), the regulation element is commanded, up to a point, to produce a higher output voltage–by dropping less of the input voltage (for linear series regulators and buck switching regulators), or to draw input current for longer periods (boost-type switching regulators); if the output voltage is too high, the regulation element will normally be commanded to produce a lower voltage. However, many regulators have over-current protection, so that they will entirely stop sourcing current (or limit the current in some way) if the output current is too high, and some regulators may also shut down if the input voltage is outside a given range (see also: crowbar circuits).|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to examine whether a simple linear feedback model of arterial pressure (AP) control by the sympathetic nervous system would be able to reproduce the characteristic features of normal AP variability by using AP and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) data collected in conscious sinoaortic baroreceptor denervated (SAD) rats. As compared with baroreceptor-intact rats (n = 8), SAD rats (n = 10) had increased spectral power (+ 680 %) of AP in the low frequency range (LF, 0. 0003 – 0. 14 Hz) and reduced power (− 19 %) in the mid-frequency range (MF, 0. 14 – 0. 8 Hz) containing Mayer waves. In individual SAD rats, RSNA data were translated into ‘sympathetic’ AP time series by using the RSNA–AP transfer function that had been previously characterized in anaesthetized rats. AP ‘perturbation’ time series were then calculated by subtracting ‘sympathetic’ from actual AP time series. Actual RSNA and AP ‘perturbation’ time series were introduced in a reflex loop that was closed by using the previously identified baroreflex transfer function (from baroreceptor afferent activity to RSNA). By progressively increasing the <b>open-loop</b> static <b>gain,</b> it was possible to compute virtual AP power spectra that increasingly deviated from their progenitor spectra, with spectral power decreasing in the LF range (as a result of baroreflex buffering of haemodynamic perturbations), and increasing in the MF band (as a result of increasing transients at the resonance frequency of the loop). The most accurate reproduction of actual AP and RSNA spectra observed in baroreceptor-intact rats was obtained at 20 – 30 % of the baroreflex critical <b>gain</b> (<b>open-loop</b> static <b>gain</b> resulting in self-sustained oscillations at the resonance frequency). In conclusion, while the gain of the sympathetic component of the arterial baroreceptor reflex largely determines its ability to provide an efficient correction of slow haemodynamic perturbations, this is achieved at the cost of increasing transients at higher frequencies (Mayer waves). However, the system remains fundamentally stable...|$|R
