The milling, in {{combination}} with the non-circular shape of the 20p and 50p, serve as the primary means of identification and differentiation between coinage for blind <b>or</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> people.

In 2001, the arrest of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov for alleged infringement of the DMCA was a highly publicized example of the law's use to prevent or penalize development of anti-DRM measures. He was arrested in the US after a presentation at DEF CON, and spent several months in jail. The DMCA has also been cited as chilling to non-criminal inclined users, such as students of cryptanalysis including, Professor Felten and students at Princeton University; security consultants, such as Netherlands based Niels Ferguson, who declined to publish vulnerabilities he discovered in Intel's secure-computing scheme due to fear of being arrested under the DMCA when he travels to the US; and blind <b>or</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> users of screen readers or other assistive technologies.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the causes of}} childhood blindness and severe visual impairment in pupils attending schools for the blind in Burundi in order to assist planning for services in the country. Materials and Methods: All pupils attending three schools for the blind in Burundi were examined. A modified WHO/PBL eye examination record form for children with blindness and low vision was used to record the findings. Data was analyzed for those who became blind <b>or</b> severely <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> {{before the age of}} 16 years. Results: Overall, 117 pupils who became <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> before 16 years of age were examined. Of these, 109 (93. 2 %) were blind <b>or</b> severely <b>visually</b> <b>impaired.</b> The major anatomical cause of blindness or severe visual impairment was cornea pathology/phthisis (23. 9 %), followed by lens pathology (18. 3 %), uveal lesions (14. 7 %) and optic nerve lesions (11. 9 %). In the majority of pupils with blindness or severe visual impairment, the underlying etiology of visual loss was unknown (74. 3 %). More than half of the pupils with lens related blindness had not had surgery; among those who had surgery, outcomes were generally poor. Conclusion: The causes identified indicate the importance of continuing preventive public health strategies, as well as the development of specialist pediatric ophthalmic services in the management of childhood blindness in Burundi. The geographic distribution of pupils at the schools for the blind indicates a need for community-based programs to identify and refer children in need of services...|$|R
