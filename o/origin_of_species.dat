5|$|After Charles Darwin {{published}} <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species</b> in 1859, much of {{the focus}} of paleontology shifted to understanding evolutionary paths, including human evolution, and evolutionary theory.|$|E
5|$|From Aristotle until Darwin, {{the natural}} world was {{predominantly}} considered static and unchanging. Prior to The <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species,</b> there was little appreciation or understanding of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between organisms, their adaptations, and the environment. An exception is the 1789 publication Natural History of Selborne by Gilbert White (1720–1793), considered {{by some to be}} one of the earliest texts on ecology. While Charles Darwin is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution, he was one of the founders of soil ecology, and he made note of the first ecological experiment in The <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species.</b> Evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} Genetics and the <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species</b> (1937), Theodosius Dobzhansky {{established}} {{the idea that}} mutation, once seen as a rival to selection, actually supplied the raw material for natural selection by creating genetic diversity.|$|E
40|$|Coral reefs exhibit highly {{congruent}} {{patterns of}} biodiversity, with a prominent hotspot in the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA). Unlike many terrestrial systems, the IAA hotspot exhibits extensive latitudinal and longitudinal biodiversity gradients. Conflicting hypotheses have highlighted {{the importance of}} the area as a centre <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> overlap or accumulation, with the location of endemics being used as the primary criterion for testing these hypotheses, by identifying the presumed geographical <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>species.</b> We evaluate the utility of marine endemics for resolving these hypotheses, and examine recent molecular phylogenetic evidence for coral reef species that has revealed the antiquity of the endemics and the other species that make up this hotspot. These analyses emphasize {{the importance of the}} IAA in the survival rather than the <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>species...</b>|$|R

5|$|When Darwin {{received}} Alfred Russel Wallace's {{paper that}} described natural selection, Hooker and Charles Lyell {{arranged for a}} joint reading of papers by Darwin and Wallace to the Linnean Society on July1, 1858. Since Darwin had nothing prepared, the reading included excerpts from his 1844 Essay and from a letter he had sent to Asa Gray in July 1857 outlining his theory on the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>species.</b> By that time, Darwin had begun writing his book On the <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species.</b> The correspondence with Gray was thus a key piece of evidence in establishing Darwin's intellectual priority {{with respect to the}} theory of evolution by natural selection. Neither Darwin nor Wallace attended the meeting. The papers were published by the society as On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection. By summer 1859 it was obvious to Gray and others working with Darwin that On the <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species</b> would be a ground-breaking book.|$|E
5|$|Between 1835 and 1837, the {{zoologist}} Edward Blyth {{worked on}} the area of variation, artificial selection, and how a similar process occurs in nature. Darwin acknowledged Blyth's ideas in the first chapter on variation of On the <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species.</b>|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{quoted a}} passage from Aristotle's Physics II 8 in The <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species,</b> which entertains the {{possibility}} of a selection process following the random combination of body parts. However, Aristotle immediately rejected the possibility, and he was in any case discussing ontogeny, the Empedoclean coming into being of an individual from component parts, not phylogeny and natural selection.|$|E

5|$|Darwin's {{work has}} {{continued}} to be celebrated by numerous publications and events. The Linnean Society of London has commemorated Darwin's achievements by the award of the Darwin–Wallace Medal since 1908. Darwin Day has become an annual celebration, and in 2009 worldwide events were arranged for the bicentenary of Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species.</b>|$|E
5|$|He also {{continued}} his critical {{work and in}} 1860 reviewed On the <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species</b> by Charles Darwin. He {{was one of the}} few contemporary critics to be sympathetic to Darwin, although he was reluctant to show he was convinced of the theories.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, {{particularly}} {{after the publication}} of On the <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species</b> in 1859, the idea that life had evolved was an active source of academic debate centred on the philosophical, social and religious implications of evolution. Today, the modern evolutionary synthesis is accepted by a vast majority of scientists. However, evolution remains a contentious concept for some theists.|$|E

5|$|Pet {{birds are}} kept in their millions, as are {{domestic}} fowls, bantams, and pigeons. These last had an important effect on evolutionary biology, as Charles Darwin took an especial interest in pigeon fancying, adopted the hobby himself, and made use of the wide variation between breeds as an argument for the power of selection in his 1859 <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species.</b>|$|E
5|$|This naturalistic {{explanation}} fitted {{well with}} the recent account of evolution by Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin, as outlined in his famous 1859 book The <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species.</b> Because this Darwinian explanation required no supernatural forces, it met with considerable criticism from anti-evolutionists, both in academic circles and in the broader social realm.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s, {{whether or}} not species evolved was a subject of intense debate, with {{prominent}} scientists arguing {{both sides of the}} issue. The publication of Charles Darwin's On the <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species</b> fundamentally transformed the discussion over biological origins. Darwin argued that his branching version of evolution explained a wealth of facts in biogeography, anatomy, embryology, and other fields of biology. He also provided the first cogent mechanism by which evolutionary change could persist: his theory of natural selection.|$|E

5|$|Charles Darwin {{mentioned}} evolutionary {{interactions between}} flowering plants and insects in On the <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species</b> (1859). The term coevolution was coined by Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964. The theoretical underpinnings of coevolution are now well-developed, and demonstrate that coevolution {{can play an}} important role in driving major evolutionary transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction or shifts in ploidy. More recently, it has also been demonstrated that coevolution influences the structure and function of ecological communities as well as the dynamics of infectious disease.|$|E
5|$|Gould became {{widely known}} through his popular essays on {{evolution}} in the Natural History magazine. His essays were published in a series entitled This View of Life (a phrase from the concluding paragraph of Charles Darwin's <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species)</b> starting from January 1974 and ended in January 2001, amounting to a continuous publication of 300 essays. Many of his essays were reprinted in collected volumes that became bestselling books such as Ever Since Darwin and The Panda's Thumb, Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes, and The Flamingo's Smile.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} eleven fossils include {{impressions}} of feathers. Because these feathers are of an advanced form (flight feathers), these fossils are {{evidence that the}} evolution of feathers began before the Late Jurassic. The type specimen of Archaeopteryx was discovered just two years after Charles Darwin published On the <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>Species.</b> Archaeopteryx seemed to confirm Darwin's theories and has since become a key piece of evidence for the origin of birds, the transitional fossils debate, and confirmation of evolution.|$|E
