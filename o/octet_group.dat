50|$|More specifically, the IEEE 802 {{standards}} {{are restricted to}} networks carrying variable-size packets. By contrast, in cell relay networks data is transmitted in short, uniformly sized units called cells. Isochronous networks, where data is transmitted as {{a steady stream of}} <b>octets,</b> or <b>groups</b> of <b>octets,</b> at regular time intervals, are also out of the scope of this standard. The number 802 was simply the next free number IEEE could assign, though “802” is sometimes associated with the date the first meeting was held — February 1980.|$|R
5000|$|Coming from this, Spira mirabilis has no fixed set-up, but it {{answers to}} what the chosen score asks for: {{it can be a}} quintet, an <b>octet,</b> a small <b>group</b> of winds or strings up to a full symphonic {{orchestra}} with choir and soloists. No matter what the set-up is, the method, the rules and the common wish stays the same. A part of the repertoire is studied and played on period instruments.|$|R
50|$|There {{are over}} 10 {{different}} publications on campus, including news and literary magazines. There are several music groups, including the Chamber Singers, Miltones, Chamber Orchestra, jazz combos and four a cappella groups—two all-female <b>groups</b> (Epic and <b>Octet),</b> an all-male <b>group</b> (Miltones), and two co-educational groups (3FU and Rezon9), which have performed throughout the United States, {{as well as}} Europe, Asia, and Africa. Milton Academy {{is also home to}} a jazz program, focused on small combos, that tours South Africa every other year. Beatnik Café, an independently run exhibition of student performances (such as jazz, improvisational skits, poetry readings, and singing), occurs three times a year. Theatrical productions provide about ten plays each year. Two student choreographed Dance Concerts are put up each year, the larger one occurring in the winter.|$|R
5000|$|By the mid-1950s, he {{was also}} {{appearing}} {{as a member of}} the BBC Welsh Singers (also known as the BBC <b>Octet),</b> a singing <b>group</b> retained by the BBC specifically to perform the music in its weekly religious broadcasts which included services and other meditative programmes such as Lighten Our Darkness. Consisting of two sopranos, two altos, two tenors and two basses, the typical character of the octet’s work is reflected in an early notice seen in the BBC Annual Report: [...] "The BBC Welsh Singers gave notable performances of a number of Bach cantatas sung in Welsh. Their quiet, nostalgic programmes of Welsh part-songs of the nineteenth century were especially popular." [...] From 1964 Griffiths was the official secretary of the octet, but in 1957 it was his membership of that group that led directly to his involvement in TV’s Land of Song. Through founder octet member and Cardiff music teacher Clifford Bunford, the BBC singers provided the core of the adult chorus recruited by ITV's music director Norman Whitehead for TWW's new Welsh musical show.|$|R
