25|$|As {{with other}} opioids, {{tolerance}} and {{physical and psychological}} dependence develop with repeated dihydrocodeine use.

25|$|Cement {{manufacture}} causes {{environmental impacts}} at {{all stages of}} the process. These include emissions of airborne pollution {{in the form of}} dust, gases, noise and vibration when <b>operating</b> <b>machinery</b> and during blasting in quarries, and damage to countryside from quarrying. Equipment to reduce dust emissions during quarrying and manufacture of cement is widely used, and equipment to trap and separate exhaust gases are coming into increased use. Environmental protection also includes the re-integration of quarries into the countryside after they have been closed down by returning them to nature or re-cultivating them.|$|E
25|$|Zopiclone causes {{impaired}} driving skills {{similar to}} those of benzodiazepines. Long-term users of hypnotic drugs for sleep disorders develop only partial tolerance to adverse effects on driving with users of hypnotic drugs even after 1 year of use still showing an increased motor vehicle accident rate. Patients who drive motor vehicles should not take zopiclone unless they stop driving due to a significant increased risk of accidents in zopiclone users. Zopiclone induces impairment of psychomotor function. Driving or <b>operating</b> <b>machinery</b> should be avoided after taking zopiclone as effects can carry over to the next day, including impaired hand eye coordination.|$|E

25|$|The {{committee}} {{recommended that}} all benzodiazepine treatment be withdrawn gradually and recommended that benzodiazepine treatment {{be used only}} in carefully selected patients and that therapy be limited to short-term use only. It was noted in the review that alcohol can potentiate the central nervous system-depressant effects of benzodiazepines and should be avoided. The central nervous system-depressant effects of benzodiazepines may make driving or <b>operating</b> <b>machinery</b> dangerous, and the elderly {{are more prone to}} these adverse effects. High single doses or repeated low doses have been reported to produce hypotonia, poor sucking, and hypothermia in the neonate, and irregularities in the fetal heart. The committee recommended that benzodiazepines be avoided in lactation.|$|E
25|$|Portland cement {{manufacture}} can cause environmental impacts at {{all stages of}} the process. These include emissions of airborne pollution {{in the form of}} dust; gases; noise and vibration when <b>operating</b> <b>machinery</b> and during blasting in quarries; consumption of large quantities of fuel during manufacture; release of CO2 from the raw materials during manufacture, and damage to countryside from quarrying. Equipment to reduce dust emissions during quarrying and manufacture of cement is widely used, and equipment to trap and separate exhaust gases are coming into increased use. Environmental protection also includes the re-integration of quarries into the countryside after they have been closed down by returning them to nature or re-cultivating them.|$|E
25|$|Special {{calibrated}} strobe lights, {{capable of}} flashing up {{to hundreds of}} times per second, are used in industry to stop the appearance of motion of rotating and other repetitively <b>operating</b> <b>machinery</b> and to measure, or adjust, the rotation speeds or cycle times. Since this stop is only apparent, a marked point on the rotating body will either appear to move backward or forward, or not move, depending on {{the frequency of the}} strobe-flash. If the flash occurs equal to the period of rotation (or evenly multiplied, i.e. 2*π*n/ω, where n is an integer and ω the angular frequency) the marked point will appear to not move. Any non integer flash setting will make the mark appear to move forward or backward, e.g. a slight increase of the flash frequency will make the point appear to move backward.|$|E

25|$|The 12-inch/40 calibre Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1893/96 gun was {{a typical}} {{built-up}} French heavy gun of its period. It used a Welin interrupted-screw breech and bagged propellant with a de Bange obturator {{to get a good}} gas seal during firing. It was mounted in twin-gun turrets which had a couple of unusual features. First, most of the turret's <b>operating</b> <b>machinery</b> was housed inside the turret, with only an armored tube to protect the ammunition hoists. This made little difference in the overall weight of the turret, but did raise the machinery higher in the ship than the turrets of other nations, which did have implications for stability. Secondly, they used a hydraulic pivot to lift the turret when it rotated; this was lowered onto a seating ring when the turret was in the proper position to fire. Each turret had a nominal 300° of traverse, although each ship had its own specific limitations.|$|E
25|$|Child labour {{is still}} common {{in many parts}} of the world. Estimates for child labour vary. It ranges between 250 and 304 million, if {{children}} aged 5–17 involved in any economic activity are counted. If light occasional work is excluded, ILO estimates there were 153 million child labourers aged 5–14 worldwide in 2008. This is about 20 million less than ILO estimate for child labourers in 2004. Some 60 percent of the child labour was involved in agricultural activities such as farming, dairy, fisheries and forestry. Another 25 percent of child labourers were in service activities such as retail, hawking goods, restaurants, load and transfer of goods, storage, picking and recycling trash, polishing shoes, domestic help, and other services. The remaining 15 percent laboured in assembly and manufacturing in informal economy, home-based enterprises, factories, mines, packaging salt, <b>operating</b> <b>machinery,</b> and such operations. Two out of three child workers work alongside their parents, in unpaid family work situations. Some children work as guides for tourists, sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and restaurants. Child labour predominantly occurs in the rural areas (70%) and informal urban sector (26%).|$|E
500|$|The A1 {{merges with}} the North Circular Road (A406) {{and the two}} routes run briefly together, {{crossing}} over the Henlys Corner interchange. Henlys Corner is a junction with the 1820s turnpike road, Finchley Road, which was built to provide a by-pass to the route north from London through Hampstead; the name changes to Regents Park Road on the northern, Finchley, side of the junction. The junction had an £8 million upgrade completed in January 2012, which included Britain's first [...] "hands-free" [...] pedestrian crossing to allow Orthodox Jews to reach the nearby Finchley Synagogue, one of Europe's largest, without <b>operating</b> <b>machinery</b> on the Sabbath.

2500|$|The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) has {{invested}} nearly US$1 billion in widening and modernizing the canal, {{with the aim}} of increasing capacity by 20%. The ACP cites a number of major improvements, including the widening and straightening of the Gaillard Cut to reduce restrictions on passing vessels, the deepening of the navigational channel in Gatun Lake to reduce draft restrictions and improve water supply, and the deepening of the Atlantic and Pacific entrances to the canal. This is supported by new equipment, such as a new drill barge and suction dredger, and an increase of the tug boat fleet by 20%. In addition, improvements have been made to the canal's <b>operating</b> <b>machinery,</b> including an increased and improved tug locomotive fleet, the replacement of more than [...] of locomotive track, and new lock machinery controls. Improvements have been made to the traffic management system to allow more efficient control over ships in the canal.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} industries {{were those}} connected with agriculture, {{such as the}} brewing of traditional beers and ales. Lime-burning and chalk-mining also had their place.
