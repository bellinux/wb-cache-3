25|$|If the {{three-phase}} bridge rectifier is operated symmetrically (as {{positive and negative}} supply voltage), the center point of the rectifier on the <b>output</b> <b>side</b> (or the so-called isolated reference potential) opposite the center point of the transformer (or the neutral conductor) has a potential difference in form of a triangular common-mode voltage. For this reason, the two centers must never be connected to each other, otherwise short-circuit currents would flow. The ground of the {{three-phase bridge}} rectifier in symmetrical operation is thus decoupled from the neutral conductor or the earth of the mains voltage. Powered by a transformer, earthing of the center point of the bridge is possible, provided that the secondary winding of the transformer is electrically isolated from the mains voltage and the star point of the secondary winding is not on earth. In this case, however, (negligible) leakage currents are flowing over the transformer windings.|$|E
25|$|Is {{the main}} {{amplifier}} block also a two-port? The main amplifier {{is shown in}} the upper shaded box. The ground connections are labeled. Figure 7 shows the interesting fact that the main amplifier does not satisfy the port conditions at its input and output unless the ground connections are chosen to make that happen. For example, on the input side, the current entering the main amplifier is IS. This current is divided three ways: to the feedback network, to the bias resistor RB and to the base resistance of the input transistor rπ. To satisfy the port condition for the main amplifier, all three components must be returned to the input side of the main amplifier, which means all the ground leads labeled G1 must be connected, as well as emitter lead GE1. Likewise, on the <b>output</b> <b>side,</b> all ground connections G2 must be connected and also ground connection GE2. Then, {{at the bottom of the}} schematic, underneath the feedback two-port and outside the amplifier blocks, G1 is connected to G2. That forces the ground currents to divide between the input and output sides as planned. Notice that this connection arrangement splits the emitter of the input transistor into a base-side and a collector-side – a physically impossible thing to do, but electrically the circuit sees all the ground connections as one node, so this fiction is permitted.|$|E

40|$|Most partial {{equilibrium}} {{models of}} the agricultural sector have not incorporated a dynamic and interlinked module for agricultural input expenditure. The South African Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy (BFAP) model, which models a major share of agricultural output in South Africa, has also up to now not integrated input expenditure into the modelling framework. In most models, input costs are treated as exogenous and the recursive link between the input and <b>output</b> <b>sides</b> of the sector is overlooked in the models that attempt to incorporate input expenditures. This article addresses both issues by integrating agricultural input expenditures into the South African sectoral partial equilibrium model by endogenising input costs and recursively linking both the input and <b>output</b> <b>sides</b> of the agricultural sector. Thus, the impact of increasing the input cost may not only signal a fall in the gross value added and net farming income, but also a growth in subsequent years when the recursive effect of the impact is fully accounted for.

50|$|The Torsen {{differential}} {{works just}} like a conventional differential, but can lock up if a torque imbalance occurs, the maximum ratio of torque imbalance being defined by the Torque Bias Ratio (TBR).

When the traction difference exceeds the TBR, the slower <b>output</b> <b>side</b> of the differential receives the tractive torque of the faster wheel multiplied by the TBR; any extra torque remaining from applied torque contributes to the angular acceleration of the faster <b>output</b> <b>side</b> of the differential.|$|E
