60|$|In the {{dim light}} the {{sentinel}} saw the retreating figure of Mr. Britling make an extravagant gesture, and wondered what it might mean. Signalling? What <b>ought</b> <b>an</b> intelligent sentry to do? Let fly at him? Arrest him?... Take no notice?...|$|R

60|$|What <b>ought</b> <b>a</b> {{wise man}} {{to do in the}} midst of these circumstances? He is silent. He waits the moment when the passions give way; he waits till reason shall preside, and till the {{multitude}} shall listen to her voice.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} Meinong’s and Veber’s {{conceptions of}} ‘ought’. Meinong’s theory of <b>ought</b> is <b>a</b> {{part of his}} value theory. In Über emotionale Präsentation the <b>ought</b> is <b>a</b> property of being, which cannot be viewed as separated from a desiring subject. The <b>ought</b> is <b>an</b> ideal object of higher order; it concerns neither factuality nor non-factuality, but subfactuality, that is the realm of possibility. In Die Natur des Sollens, Veber proposes <b>a</b> theory of <b>ought,</b> which is grounded on Meinongian concepts. The ought {{is the object of}} a volition, it is a genuine object, even though ideal. Finally, the differences between Veber’s and Meinong’s conceptions of the ought are portrayed...|$|R

6000|$|<b>Ought</b> <b>a</b> man not to smoke?--from a moral {{point of}} view. The {{economical}} view-point, the view-point of convenience, {{and all the}} rest of them, are not now in question; the simple question is: Is it immoral to smoke? And again--still from the moral point of view: Is it immoral to drink wine? Is it immoral to play at cards?--to visit theaters? (In Boston you go to some ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so, but I {{never do}} what I <b>ought,</b> <b>a</b> fact for which I am {{grateful}} {{now come to}} think of it, since otherwise I should not be here to-night. I wish to make the worst of myself, the very worst, for whatever I am not, at least I am honest. Now having told you that I am, or was half an hour ago, an idler, a good-for-nothing, prospectless failure, I ask you--if you care to hear any more?" ...|$|E

I started with it from Boston ten days or a fortnight ago, and I've found it everywhere I've stopped, and sometimes where I didn't stop.

40|$|Some irrational {{states can}} be avoided {{in more than one}} way. For example, if you believe that you <b>ought</b> to <b>A</b> you can avoid akrasia by {{intending}} to A or by dropping the belief that you <b>ought</b> to <b>A.</b> This supports the claim that some rational requirements are wide-scope. For instance, the requirement against akrasia is a requirement to intend to A or not believe that you <b>ought</b> to <b>A.</b> But some writers object that this Wide-Scope view ignores asymmetries between the different ways of avoiding irrationality. In this paper I defend the Wide-Scope view against recent objections of this sort from Mark Schroeder and Niko Kolodny. I argue that once we are clear about what the Wide-Scope view is committed to—and, importantly, what it is not—we can see that Schroeder and Kolodny’s objections fail. <br/...|$|R

Most likely, my fancies {{would never have been}} fulfilled. She will save me from my own foolishness. What <b>ought</b> <b>a</b> man to wish for more than a person sure to make him good? And--well, after all, it cannot be for a long time. They must write to Lima. Perhaps they will wait till her father's return, or at least till I have taken my degree.' ...|$|E
60|$|First of all {{the attack}} on the poop, two nights ago, in Margaret's watch. No; first, I have made another invention. Assisted by the old steward, who knows, as a Chinese <b>ought,</b> <b>a</b> deal about fireworks, and getting my {{materials}} from our signal rockets and Roman candles, I manufactured half a dozen bombs. I don't really think they are very deadly, and I know our extemporized fuses are slower than our voyage is at the present time; but nevertheless the bombs have served the purpose, as you shall see.|$|E
60|$|Therefore St. Paul says, You are {{the sons}} of God. Not--you may be, if you are very good: but you are, in order that you may become very good. Your being good does not {{tell you that you}} are {{the sons of}} God: your baptism tells you so. Your baptism gives you a right to say, I am the child of God. How shall I behave then? What <b>ought</b> <b>a</b> child of God to be like? Now St. Paul, you see, knew well that we could not make {{ourselves}} God's children by any feelings, fancies, or experiences of our own. But he knew just as well that we cannot make ourselves behave as God's children should, by any thoughts and trying of our own.|$|E

6000|$|... "Talk o' woman's rights, as {{one hears}} about, and woman's having <b>a</b> vote; we <b>ought</b> to have <b>a</b> vote as to strikes. It's us as bears the worse o't, and we <b>ought</b> to have <b>a</b> say on't; {{if we did}} there wouldn't be another strike in the country." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ought</b> not <b>a</b> government, vested {{with such}} {{extensive}} and indefinite authority, {{to have been}} restricted by a declaration of rights? It certainly <b>ought.</b> So clear <b>a</b> point is this, that I cannot help suspecting that persons who attempt to persuade people that such reservations were less necessary under this Constitution than under those of the States, are wilfully endeavoring to deceive, and to lead you into an absolute state of vassalage.|$|R
6000|$|I {{began to}} reflect. I said to myself: [...] "What <b>ought</b> <b>a</b> boy to do who has stolen a green {{watermelon}}? What would George Washington do, {{the father of}} his country, the only American who could not tell a lie? What would he do? There is only one right, high, noble thing for any boy to do who has stolen a watermelon of that class he must make restitution; he must restore that stolen property to its rightful owner." [...] I said I would do it when I made that good resolution. I felt {{it to be a}} noble, uplifting obligation. I rose up spiritually stronger and refreshed. I carried that watermelon back--what was left of it--and restored it to the farmer, and made him give me a ripe one in its place.|$|E
60|$|Sir Thomas More.--It is not {{implicit}} assent that I require, but reasonable conviction after {{calm and}} sufficient consideration. David {{was permitted to}} choose between the three severest dispensations of God's displeasure, and he made choice of pestilence as the least dreadful. <b>Ought</b> <b>a</b> reflecting and religious man to be surprised, if some such punishment were dispensed to this country, not less in mercy than in judgment, as the means of averting a more terrible and abiding scourge? An endemic malady, as destructive as the plague, has naturalised itself among your American brethren, and in Spain. You have hitherto escaped it, speaking with reference to secondary causes, merely because it has not yet been imported. But any season may bring it to your own shores; or at any hour it may appear among you homebred.|$|E
60|$|That in immolating {{herself by}} refusing him, and leaving him free to work wonders {{for the good}} of his fellow-creatures, she would in all {{probability}} add to the sum of human felicity, consoled her by its breadth as an idea even while it tortured her by making herself the scapegoat or single unit on whom the evil would fall. <b>Ought</b> <b>a</b> possibly large number, Swithin included, to remain unbenefited because the one individual to whom his release would be an injury chanced to be herself? Love between man and woman, which in Homer, Moses, and other early exhibitors of life, is mere desire, had for centuries past so far broadened as to include sympathy and friendship; surely it should in this advanced stage of the world include benevolence also. If so, it was her duty to set her young man free.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{case was}} much canvassed in the Army," [...] says poor Kuster; [...] "it was the topic in every tent among Officers and common Men. And among us Army-Chaplains too," [...] poor honest souls, [...] "the {{question}} of conflicting duties arose: Your King ordering one thing, {{and your own}} Conscience another, what <b>ought</b> <b>a</b> man to do? What ought an Army-Chaplain to preach or advise? And considerable mutual light in regard to it we struck out from one another, and saw how a prudent Army-Chaplain might steer his way. Our general conclusion was, That neither the King nor Saldern could well be called wrong. Saldern listening to the inner voice; right he, for certain. But withal the King, in his place, might judge such a thing expedient and fit; perhaps Saldern himself would, had Saldern been King of Prussia there in January, 1761." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I enclose {{a picture}} in {{perspective}} and colour of my 'form.' I have taken great pains with this, but am far from satisfied with it. I know nothing about drawing, and consequently am unable to put upon the paper just what I see. The faults which I find with the picture are these. The rectangles stand out too distinctly, as something lying on the plane instead of being, as they <b>ought,</b> <b>a</b> part of the plane. The view is taken of necessity from an unnatural stand-point, and some way or other the region 1-12 does not look right. The landscape is altogether too distinct in its features. I rather {{know that there is}} grass, and that there are trees in the distance, than see them. But the grass within a few feet of the line I see distinctly. I cannot make the hill at the right slope down to the plane as it ought. It is too steep. I have had my poor success in indicating my notion of the darkness which overhangs the region of eleven. In reality it is not a cloud at all, but a darkness.|$|E
60|$|This drawback, rather {{severely}} felt by {{most people}} who engaged in commercial transactions with the inhabitants of Bleeding Heart Yard, was a large stumbling-block in Mrs Plornish's trade. When Mr Dorrit had established her in the business, the Bleeding Hearts had shown an amount of emotion and a determination to support her in it, that did honour to human nature. Recognising her claim upon their generous feelings as one who had long {{been a member of}} their community, they pledged themselves, with great feeling, to deal with Mrs Plornish, come what would and bestow their patronage on no other establishment. Influenced by these noble sentiments, they had even gone {{out of their way to}} purchase little luxuries in the grocery and butter line to which they were unaccustomed; saying to one another, that if they did stretch a point, was it not for a neighbour and a friend, and for whom <b>ought</b> <b>a</b> point to be stretched if not for such? So stimulated, the business was extremely brisk, and the articles in stock went off with the greatest celerity. In short, if the Bleeding Hearts had but paid, the undertaking would have been a complete success; whereas, by reason of their exclusively confining themselves to owing, the profits actually realised had not yet begun to appear in the books.|$|E
