25|$|The statue was rededicated on October 19, 2012 by General John Mulholland. At {{the time}} of the {{original}} battle he was Lieutenant general and Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Special Forces Command. He dedicated the statue in its new location in front of One World Trade Center across from Ground Zero and 9/11 Memorial. The bronze statue was positioned so the soldier atop the horse is keeping a watchful eye as he looks back <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the World Trade Center and its tenants. Soldiers representing the United States Army Special Operations Command attended the ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|Love Imprisoned {{features}} a nude woman, {{seated on the}} ground, who has bound Cupid between two trees with a garland of flowers. [...] The annoyed deity looks <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> his captor, whose back is to the viewer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mechanic}} {{said he had}} {{remarked to}} Denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant. Denver had asked how much fuel was shown. He told Denver there was [...] "less than half in the right tank and {{less than a quarter}} in the left tank". He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so he could look <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the fuel gauges. The mirror was later recovered in the wreckage. Denver said he would use the autopilot inflight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve. He turned down an offer to refuel, saying he would be flying for about an hour.|$|E
60|$|He strolled along blithely, {{casting a}} glance <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>at</b> the dusty cloud which {{hung over the}} Seamew as he went. It was virgin soil to him, and he thirsted for adventure.|$|R
60|$|At Yarmouth {{the door}} was {{snatched}} open, {{and there was a}} confusion of shouting and running; a swarm of humanity, clamouring, attached itself at the carriage doorway, which was immediately blocked by a stout man who heaved a leather bag in front of him as he cried in German that here was room for all. Faces innumerable--hot, blue-eyed faces--strained to look <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>at</b> the shocked girl and the amazed Siegmund.|$|R
60|$|Shoulder-high {{beside him}} hung the {{photogravure}} {{that had already}} saved his life once. Why not again? He snatched it from its hangings, lifted it above his head in both hands, and hurled it {{at the head of}} the old man. The glass shattered full upon the ancient's crown, the man's head went through the picture, and the frame settled <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders.</b> <b>At</b> the same instant Barney Custer leaped across the bed, seized a light chair, and turned to face his foe upon more even turns.|$|R
2500|$|He also recounts a {{chain of}} events which led to a major change in the International Laws of Association Football. On 13 May 1967, Stoke City visited Old Trafford to play Manchester United, just after United had been {{confirmed}} as the old Division One champions. Paddy Crerand of United had an altercation with Peter Dobing of Stoke. Unknown to Partridge, TV cameras picked up Crerand's action of spitting <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> Tony Allen, another Stoke player. Partridge later received a letter from Alan Hardaker, the then secretary of the Football League, asking for his observations on the incident, but was unable to respond with conclusive evidence. Nevertheless the International Board changed the Laws of the Game to put spitting on a par with violent conduct, and therefore a dismissible offence.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the first}} day, Cowan pulled the tanks {{out of the}} town during the night, {{although}} he left patrols to defend the area already captured. The next day, 1 March, Cowan had the Corps commander (Lieutenant General Frank Messervy) and General Slim watching anxiously <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> his headquarters, both worried that the Japanese might hold out for weeks. In the event, in spite of desperate resistance, the town fell {{in less than four}} days. Although the Japanese had plenty of artillery, they were unable to concentrate their fire sufficiently to stop any single attacking brigade. Lack of anti-tank weapons gravely handicapped the defenders. Slim later described watching two platoons from 1/7th Gurkha Rifles supported by a single M4 Sherman tank overrun several Japanese bunkers and eliminate their defenders in a few minutes, with only a few casualties to themselves. In an attempt to improvise anti-tank defences, some Japanese soldiers crouched in trenches, clutching [...] aircraft bombs, with orders to strike the detonator when an enemy tank loomed over the trench. Most were shot by an officer of 255 Brigade and Indian soldiers.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this point}} Adorno {{reversed}} his earlier priorities: now his musical activities came {{second to the}} development of a philosophical theory of aesthetics. Thus, in the middle of 1929 he accepted Paul Tillich's offer to present an Habilitation on Kierkegaard, which Adorno eventually submitted under the title The Construction of the Aesthetic. At the time, Kierkegaard's philosophy exerted a strong influence, chiefly through its claim to pose an alternative to Idealism and Hegel's philosophy of history. Yet when Adorno turned his attention to Kierkegaard, watchwords like [...] "anxiety," [...] "inwardness" [...] and [...] "leap"—instructive for existentialist philosophy—were detached from their theological origins and posed, instead, as problems for aesthetics. As the work proceeded—and Kierkegaard's overcoming of Hegel's idealism was revealed to be a mere interiorization—Adorno excitedly remarked in a letter to Berg that he was writing without looking <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the faculty who would soon evaluate his work. Receiving favourable reports from Professors Tillich and Horkheimer, as well as Benjamin and Kracauer, the University conferred on Adorno the venia legendi in February 1931; on the very day his revised study was published, 23 March 1933, Hitler seized dictatorial powers.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What part are {{you working}} at to-day, Artie?' said the old shoemaker, looking <b>over</b> <b>his</b> son's <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the blank music paper before him. 'Quartette of Biological Professors, eh?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A job for Burgess and Co. at any rate,' {{said the}} visitor, looking <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> compassionately <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own legs, which were very wet {{and covered with}} splashes. 'Oh, how-de-do, Mr Gills?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, {{you have}} {{completely}} turned the boat, Miss Graye?' he said, looking <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> 'Look <b>at</b> our track on the water--a great semicircle, {{preceded by a}} series of zigzags {{as far as we can}} see.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{then pointed}} <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the attic {{up in the}} wall.|$|E
60|$|He glanced <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> Razumov, {{who waited}} for him to move on.|$|E
60|$|The {{physician}} stared <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> Bindon's expression, {{and then}} altered the prescription.|$|E
60|$|He {{rose and}} looked <b>over</b> <b>his</b> son's <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the letter {{which he was}} reading--one thin sheet of foreign note paper, covered with closely written lines of faint, angular writing, and {{emitting}} even now a delicate musky scent.|$|R
60|$|Up to {{now they}} had been rowing in an easy and leisurely manner, {{avoiding}} all appearance of haste. They now bent to their oars, and the boat began to travel a good deal faster through the water. Vincent glanced <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> frequently <b>at</b> the steam launch.|$|R
60|$|The little party {{mounted the}} road until they {{stood on the}} {{platform}} from which the bridge started. One {{of them was a}} tall figure, dressed in armour, and with long black hair flowing down from under <b>his</b> helmet <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Wulf <b>at</b> once, from the descriptions he had heard of the chief's appearance, recognized him as Llewellyn ap Rhys.|$|R
60|$|He nodded <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> Zack, {{and walked}} away quickly in the {{direction}} of Kirk Street.|$|E
60|$|At a loss, Ernest Augustus stared a moment, then flung {{a glance}} <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the Countess.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Kantwise said nothing, but {{he looked}} round <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> Kenneby, and then shut his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|The Malay, {{without the}} least flinch of feature or pose, {{as if he}} had been an inanimate object called {{suddenly}} into life by some hidden magic of the words, spun the wheel rapidly, letting the spokes pass through his hands; and when the motion had stopped with a grinding noise, caught hold again and held on grimly. After a while, however, he turned <b>his</b> head slowly <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> glanced <b>at</b> the sea, and said in an obstinate tone: ...|$|R
60|$|That {{was on a}} Monday. On Tuesday {{he climbed}} the stone stair of the Gold King, looking <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> gloriously <b>at</b> each step, and on Wednesday he struck three and went into knickerbockers. For the Kensington Gardens, you must know, are full of short cuts, {{familiar}} to all who play there; and the shortest leads from the baby in long clothes to the little boy of three riding on the fence. It is called the Mother's Tragedy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you would, would you?" [...] demanded her father, {{delighted with}} her defiance, and {{twisting}} his fat head around <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> to look <b>at</b> her. [...] "Well, you wouldn't {{do it on}} my money, {{if you were a}} son of MINE, young lady." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's no {{imagination}} in his eye,' returned Mr Willet, glancing <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the organ in question, 'certainly.' ...|$|E
60|$|He looked upward, <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>at</b> {{the little}} cluster of farm-buildings and cottages, and the gray stone church.|$|E
60|$|Rose peeped <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> it, {{and then}} turned to the arithmetical puzzle in her hand with a sigh of despair.|$|E
6000|$|... "As twelve o'clock sounded, {{the prison}} gates opened, an aide appeared, {{followed}} by Peytel, {{leaning on the}} arm of the curé. Peytel's face was pale, he had a long black beard, a blue cap on his head, and <b>his</b> great-coat flung <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and buttoned <b>at</b> the neck.|$|R
6000|$|... "Scarcely," [...] said Attwater; [...] "or {{there was}} one day at least when we gave up. There were five of the dead that morning, and {{thirteen}} of the dying, and no one able to go about except the sexton and myself. We held a council of war, took the ... empty bottles ... into the lagoon, and ... buried them." [...] He looked <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> back <b>at</b> the bright water. [...] "Well, so you'll come to dinner, then? Shall we say half-past six? So good of you!" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} he {{observed}} that Flora blushed, smiled in a peculiar manner, and, instead of looking in <b>his</b> face, glanced <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> as if <b>at</b> some object behind him. Turning quickly round, he beheld Thackombau, still decked out in his Sunday clothes, gazing at them in open-mouthed amazement.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of niggers!" [...] shouted Harry, looking <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> Hamilton, {{with a broad}} grin; [...] "no, Jacques, {{not exactly}} of niggers--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Speak to him," [...] whispered Dick, looking <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> March, who advanced, and, {{kneeling}} at {{the side}} of the couch, said-- ...|$|E
60|$|The Jew {{walked to}} the door: looking <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the boy as he went. Suddenly stopping, he called him by his name.|$|E
60|$|He stopped. Regina had {{suddenly}} changed colour. Instead {{of looking at}} him, she was looking <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> apparently <b>at</b> something behind him. He turned {{to see what it}} was. A lady, short and stout, with strange wild sorrowful eyes, had noiselessly entered the room while he was speaking: she was waiting, as it seemed, until he had finished what he had to say. When they confronted each other, she moved to meet him, with a firm heavy step, and with her hand held out in token of welcome.|$|R
60|$|This pleasantry so tickles Mr. Smallweed that he laughs, {{long and}} low, before the fire. But ever while he laughs, he glances <b>over</b> <b>his</b> paralytic <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> Mr. George and eagerly watches {{him as he}} unlocks the padlock of a homely {{cupboard}} at the distant end of the gallery, looks here and there upon the higher shelves, and ultimately takes something out with a rustling of paper, folds it, {{and puts it in}} his breast. Then Judy pokes Mr. Smallweed once, and Mr. Smallweed pokes Judy once.|$|R
6000|$|But {{never had}} the {{extraordinary}} advantages of open-air study presented themselves so vividly. Before breakfast he took {{half an hour of}} open-air reading along the allotments lane near the Frobishers' house, after breakfast and before school he went through the avenue with a book, and returned from school to his lodgings circuitously through the avenue, and so back to the avenue for thirty minutes or so before afternoon school. When Mr. Lewisham was not looking over the top of his book during these periods of open-air study, then commonly he was glancing <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> And <b>at</b> last who should he see but--! ...|$|R
