40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this thesis is to account for a new method of {{limiting}} the risk of smoke leaking out from the open fireplace into the room. The improved functionality is obtained by adding a turnplate to the open fireplace mounted horizontally inside the lower edge at {{the hood of the}} open fire. The streams of smoke and air, which are cold of the contact with the cool surfaces in the stove, have a tendency to fall down along the inside of the hood and continue out into the room. The stream is stopped and redirected back up into the chimney by the turnplate. The development of the method is based on measuring of temperatures and air flows in a monitored fireplace. Tests have been carried out partially in a test fireplace in full scale and partially in a model of the test fireplace at the scale 1 : 2. The model fireplace is made in glass which makes it possible to study and photograph the streams of smoke inside of the fireplace and <b>oil</b> <b>fog</b> has been used for the demonstration. Temperatures on surfaces and gases in the fireplace have been measured during different periods of time. These measurements have shown that the greatest risk for backwards floating air currents occurs directly after having lit the fire and during some hour after that. It is during this time the temperatures in the fireplace will rise. Measurements and also film-recordings have therefore been concentrated to these periods of time. The heat gain from the fire has been measured in connection to the tests. The distribution of the heat through radiation and convection based on the temperature measurements is shown.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for quantifying population dynamics and food source value of insect fauna in areas subjected to <b>fog</b> <b>oil</b> smoke was developed. Our approach employed an environmentally controlled re-circulating wind tunnel {{outfitted with a}} high-heat vaporization and re-condensation <b>fog</b> <b>oil</b> generator that {{has been shown to}} produce aerosols of comparable chemistry and droplet-size distribution as those of field releases of the smoke. This method provides reproducible exposures of insects under realistic climatic and environmental conditions to <b>fog</b> <b>oil</b> aerosols that duplicate chemical and droplet-size characteristics of field releases of the smoke. The responses measured take into account reduction in food sources due to death and to changes in availability of relevant life stages of insects that form the prey base for the listed Threatened and Endangered Species. The influence of key environmental factors, wind speed and canopy structure on these responses were characterized. Data generated using this method was used to develop response functions related to particle size, concentration, wind speed, and canopy structure that will allow military personnel to assess and manage impacts to endangered species from <b>fog</b> <b>oil</b> smoke used in military training...|$|R

Early smoke screen experiments attempted the use of colored pigment, but found that titanium dioxide was the most light scattering particle known and therefore best for use in obscuring troops and naval vessels. Colored smoke became primarily used for signaling rather than obscuring. In today's military, smoke grenades {{are found to be}} non-cancer causing, unlike the 50's AN-M8 model.|$|R
40|$|Fish-oil supplementation {{may play}} a {{positive}} role in inflammation. Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important in controlling tumor growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Several tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) are known to regulate the activity of specific MMPs. PURPOSE: To {{examine the effects of}} dietary fish-oil supplementation and acute eccentric exercise on MMP- 1, - 2, - 9, and - 10 and TIMP- 1, - 2, - 3, and - 4 during two different phases of menstrual cycle. METHODS: As a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled design, 22 college-aged women (age= 20. 86 ± 1. 39 years) were randomly assigned to either a fish <b>oil</b> (<b>FOG,</b> N= 11) or a placebo group (PG, N= 11). Participants in the FOG ingested 6 capsules of fish oil per day (total 6. 0 g, containing 2. 4 g eicosapentaenoic acid and 1. 8 g docosahexaenoic acid), while the PG took 6 capsules of safflower oil per day for 3 weeks. Participants in each group performed an acute bout of eccentric single-leg exercise (10 sets of 10 repetitions with a 3 -min rest between sets at an isokinetic speed of 30 ⁰/second) during the mid-follicular (MF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases. The leg exercised for the MF phase was randomly selected and the opposing leg exercised during the ML phase. Overnight blood samples were collected at baseline, 6 -hr post-exercise (6 hr-PE), and 24 -hr PE during the MF and ML phases. Data were analyzed by a separate 2 x 2 x 3 ANOVA with repeated measures along with an appropriate post-hoc test for any significant interactions (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). RESULTS: A significant interaction effect (p= 0. 005) in MMP- 1 indicated that MMP- 1 in the FOG (193. 71 ± 21. 72 pg/mL) was higher than that of the placebo group (120. 79 ± 21. 72 pg/mL) during the MF phase. Both TIMP- 1 and - 3 were significantly higher (p=. 043 and p=. 037, respectively) in the FOG (68674. 71 ± 2238. 56 and 3827. 12 ± 193. 67 pg/mL, respectively) than the placebo group (62119. 26 ± 2178. 86 and 3238. 94 ± 186. 73 pg/mL, respectively). CONCLUSION: Acute eccentric exercise did not affect MMPs and TIMPs in healthy, young females. MMP- 1 was the only proteinase affected by the menstrual cycle and a decrease in MMP- 1 during the ML phase might be related to elevated estradiol levels. Elevated TIMP- 1 and - 3 following the 3 -weeks of fish-oil supplementation suggested a potential anti-inflammatory effect of the fish-oil supplementation by inhibiting activation of MMPs. It is recommended that an extended period of fish oil supplementation be implemented to further examine its anti-inflammatory effect on other inflammatory biomarkers in different sample groups including both pre- and post-menopausal women...|$|E
