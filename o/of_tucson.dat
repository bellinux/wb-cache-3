5|$|Ranchers grazed {{thousands}} of cattle {{on public land}} that would later {{become part of the}} park, and homesteaders farmed and ranched {{at the base of the}} Rincons, filing homestead applications from the 1890s through 1930. The remains of the former Freeman Homestead, established in 1929, lies along a nature trail in the RMD. The homestead is on the Arizona State Register of Historic Places. Manning Cabin, built in 1905 as a summer retreat for Levi Manning, a wealthy businessman and one-term mayor <b>of</b> <b>Tucson,</b> is part of the infrastructure at Manning Camp near Mica Mountain. Modified and restored after falling into disrepair, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Cultural resources in the park include more than 450 archeological sites and more than 60 historic structures.|$|E
5|$|Since so {{many new}} sets had to be created, the {{production}} commenced filming with location photography. Four days were spent in the Titan Missile Museum, south <b>of</b> <b>Tucson,</b> Arizona—the disarmed nuclear missile was fitted with a fiberglass capsule shell to stand in for the Phoenixs booster and command module. The old missile silo provided a large set that the budget would have prohibited building from scratch, but the small size created difficulties. Each camera move was planned in advance to work around areas where the lighting would be added, and electricians and grips donned rock-climbing harnesses to move down the shaft and attach the lights. To give greater dimension to the rocket and lend the missile a futuristic appearance, Leonetti chose to offset the missile's metallic surface with complementary colors. Using different-colored gels made the rocket appear longer than it actually was; to complete the effect, shots from the Phoenixs nose downwards and from the engines up were filmed with a 30mm lens to lengthen the missile.|$|E
5|$|Tank Girl {{was filmed}} over sixteen weeks, in three locations: desert scenes were filmed in White Sands, New Mexico, the Liquid Silver club set was built at an {{abandoned}} shopping mall in Phoenix, Arizona, and all remaining scenes were filmed within forty miles <b>of</b> <b>Tucson,</b> Arizona. Many scenes were filmed {{in an abandoned}} open-pit mine, where filming had to be halted one day due to a chemical leak. Permission was received to film the water pipe scenes at the Titan Missile Museum, near the mine, but the day before shooting permission was withdrawn. These scenes were filmed instead in a tunnel at the abandoned mine. New sets were often found by simply searching the mine. Principal photography was completed on September27, 1994, two days over schedule though still within the original budget.|$|E

25|$|Construction of {{military}} bases in Arizona was undertaken for several reasons. The state's warm weather, clear skies, large amounts of unoccupied land, good railroads, cheap labor, low taxes, and its proximity to California, made it attractive to both the military and private manufacturers. In August 1940, the government announced its intention to turn Tucson's airport, Davis-Monthan, into a major airbase. Within the next few months, the base was expanded from 300 acres to 1,600 so as to accommodate 3,000 personnel and {{the largest of the}} Air Corps' bombers. Consolidated Aircraft established a plant at Tucson Municipal Airport to modify bombers flying in from San Diego, Fort Worth, and Detroit. Two other bases were also built nearby: Ryan Field, located west <b>of</b> <b>Tucson,</b> and the Marana Field, located north <b>of</b> <b>Tucson,</b> near the town of Marana.|$|E
