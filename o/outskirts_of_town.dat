5|$|In late 1869, Earp courted 20-year-old Urilla Sutherland (c. 1849–1870), the {{daughter}} of William and Permelia Sutherland, who operated the Exchange Hotel in Lamar. They were married by his father Nicholas in Lamar on January 10, 1870, and in August 1870, Wyatt bought {{a lot on the}} <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> for $50, where he built a house. Urilla was pregnant and about to deliver their first child when she suddenly died from typhoid fever. In November, Earp sold the lot and a house on it for $75. Hoping to keep the office to which he had been appointed, he ran against his elder half-brother Newton for the office of constable. The Earps may have hoped to keep the job in the family one way or another. Wyatt won by 137 votes to Newton's 108, but their father Nicholas lost the election for justice of the peace in a very close four-way race.|$|E
5|$|White was {{a lifelong}} {{member of the}} Democratic Party. In 1876, White was {{nominated}} at the West Virginia Democratic Party Convention held in Charleston as the party's candidate for Attorney General of West Virginia despite not expressing interest in the position. That November, White {{was elected to the}} office by the largest majority won by politician in West Virginia up until that time. At the time of his election, the state's capital was Wheeling and on April 1, 1877, he relocated there with his family to serve in his post. On the morning of his departure from Romney, the residents of the community bid White farewell by turning out with two brass bands and escorting White and his family to the <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> There, an address was delivered by one of Romney's elder residents, and the White family left for Wheeling.|$|E

5|$|Burnham was {{trekking}} the 1,000 miles (1,609km) {{north from}} Durban to Matabeleland {{with his wife}} and son, an American buckboard and six donkeys when war broke out between Rhodes's British South Africa Company and the Matabele (or Ndebele) King Lobengula in late 1893. He signed up to scout for the Company immediately on reaching Matabeleland, and joined the fighting. Leander Starr Jameson, the Company's Chief Magistrate in Mashonaland, hoped to defeat the Matabele quickly by capturing Lobengula at his royal town of Bulawayo, and so sent Burnham and a small group of scouts ahead to report on the situation there. While on the <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> they watched as the Matabele burned down and destroyed everything in sight. By the time the Company troops had arrived in force, Lobengula and his warriors had fled and there was little left of old Bulawayo. The Company then moved into the remains of Bulawayo, established a base, and sent out patrols to find Lobengula. The most famous of these patrols was the Shangani Patrol, led by Major Allan Wilson and the man he chose as his Chief of Scouts, Fred Burnham.|$|E

25|$|Many {{streets in}} Chico, most notably Nord Avenue/Walnut Street, change street names after small bridges.

25|$|Richmond's Northside {{is home to}} {{numerous}} listed historic districts.

Other prominent Northside neighborhoods include Azalea, Barton Heights, Bellevue, Chamberlayne, Ginter Park, Highland Park, and Rosedale.|$|E
25|$|All {{residents}} of Brugg were thereafter subjects of Bern. Nonetheless, this changed {{little on the}} <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> as Bern's border had been pushed to the north by only a few kilometers, and conflict continued to impair the town's economy. During the eighty years subsequent to the “Brugg Night of Murder” the population of Brugg was halved and surrounding communities were able to expand their trading areas and markets {{at the expense of}} Brugg.|$|E
25|$|Bodie {{also had}} a {{cemetery}} on the <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> and a nearby mortuary. It is the only building in the town built of red brick three courses thick, most likely for insulation to keep the air temperature steady during the cold winters and hot summers.

25|$|In Okfuskee County, SH-84 {{crosses the}} North Canadian River. North of the crossing, the highway turns {{northwest}} {{to remain in}} the river valley. It then bridges Bad Creek, a tributary of the North Canadian, just upstream of its mouth. At this point, the route turns to the west, paralleling the North Canadian. The highway has a level crossing with a railroad east of Weleetka. SH-84 follows alongside the railroad until reaching its terminus at US-75 on the eastern <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E
25|$|Connecting the new Philadelphia Branch to {{the rest}} of the B system was a {{considerable}} engineering challenge. A new surface line across the center of town was politically impossible and prohibitively expensive. Building around the <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> would have required massive regrading and bridging, as the terrain is extremely hilly and the line would cut across every watershed flowing into the harbor. As a temporary expedient, traffic was handled through Baltimore on carfloats, but it was clear that a direct connection would have to be built.|$|E
