6000|$|I {{must confess}} that my imagination, in spite even of spurring, refuses {{to see any}} sort of {{submarine}} doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea. It must involve physical inconvenience of the most demoralizing sort simply to be in one {{for any length of}} time. A first-rate man who has been breathing carbonic acid and <b>oil</b> <b>vapour</b> under a pressure of four atmospheres becomes presently a second-rate man. Imagine yourself in a submarine that has ventured a few miles out of port, imagine that you have headache and nausea, and that some ship of the Cobra type is flashing itself and its search-lights about whenever you come up to the surface, and promptly tearing down on your descending bubbles with a ram, trailing perhaps a tail of grapples or a net as well. Even if you get their boat, these nicely aerated men you are fighting know they have a four to one chance of living; while for your submarine to be [...] "got" [...] is certain death. You may, of course, throw out a torpedo or so, with as much chance of hitting vitally as you would have if you were blindfolded, turned round three times, and told to fire revolver-shots at a charging elephant. The possibility of sweeping for a submarine with a seine would be vividly present in the minds of a submarine crew. If you are near shore you will probably be near rocks--an unpleasant complication in a hurried dive. There would, probably, very soon be boats out too, seeking with a machine-gun or pompom for a chance at your occasionally emergent conning-tower. In no way can a submarine be more than purblind, it will be, in fact, practically blind. Given a derelict ironclad on a still night within sight of land, a carefully handled submarine might succeed in groping its way to it and destroying it; but then it would be much better to attack such a vessel and capture it boldly with a few desperate men on a tug. At the utmost the submarine will be used in narrow waters, in rivers, or to fluster or destroy ships in harbour or with poor-spirited crews--that is to say, it will simply be an added {{power in the hands of}} the nation that is predominant at sea. And, even then, it can be merely destructive, while a sane and high-spirited fighter will always be dissatisfied if, with an indisputable superiority of force, he fails to take.[42] ...|$|E

Exposure to thyme <b>oil</b> <b>vapours</b> prior to cold storage resulted in up-regulation of the PAL gene expressionin both ‘Hass’ and ‘Ryan’ avocado when compared with untreated fruit and those treated with prochloraz®. The higher expression of PAL gene was observed in ‘Ryan’. Thyme <b>oil</b> <b>vapours</b> exposure resulted in thehigher epicatechin content. At the same time, exposure to thyme <b>oil</b> <b>vapours</b> led to down-regulation of LOX geneexpression in both cultivars.

AIMS: To assess the efficacy of Citri-V™, a vaporized blend of citrus EOs (orange: bergamot, 1 : 1 v/v) (Belmay, Northampton, UK), at removing Enterococcus sp. and S. aureus from stainless steel surfaces; and to investigate its effect on the formation of bacterial biofilms. METHODS: A microplate assay was used to assess the effect of the citrus vapour on the formation of biofilms and their metabolic activity. Biofilm removal from stainless steel surfaces was measured by a colorimetric assay and by digital microscopy. FINDINGS: The citrus vapour reduced VRE and MRSA on stainless steel surfaces by 1. 5 - 3 log(10) after 24 h exposure. Staphylococcal biofilms were reduced both during and after formation, whereas enterococcal biofilms were significantly reduced (P≤ 0. 05) only after formation.

Part of the gas from the compressor is recycled to the bottom of the retort to cool the combusted shale (shale ash) and carry the recovered heat back up the retort. Cooled shale ash exits the retort through the discharge grate in the bottom of the retort. After processing, shale ash is disposed of.

Carbon conversion to volatile products {{in the first stage}} increased from 49 % during thermal pyrolysis to 81 % at 15 MPa H 2 partial pressure.

Carbon deposition on to the combusted shale in the second stage was reduced to zero at 15 MPa H 2 partial pressure. The n-alkane distributions of the oils as determined by gas chromatography clearly demonstrated that higher hydrogen pressure, contact with combusted shale, or both contributed to lower-molecular-weight products...|$|R
40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) Brown rot {{caused by}} Monilinia fructicola {{is a major}} postharvest fungal disease in stone fruit. The need to control this disease has led to {{considerable}} reliance on synthetic fungicides.

Essential oils, which have long been generally recognised as safe for human use, {{are known for their}} antifungal properties. This project focuses on the postharvest application of lemon myrtle essential <b>oil</b> <b>vapour</b> to control brown rot on stone fruit. Sets of 20 fruit in 3 replicates were exposed to three different concentrations of lemon myrtle essential <b>oil</b> <b>vapour</b> in air; 25, 000 ppm; 30, 000 ppm and 40, 000 ppm, by placing each set within closed plastic containers with small fans to circulate the vapour during fumigations at 20 oC and 25 oC. Nectarines which were exposed to lemon myrtle <b>oil</b> <b>vapour</b> from 4 to 16 hours developed phytotoxic symptoms, while the minimum effective treatment times were 2 hour fumigations. Exposing ‘Diamond Bright’ nectarine and ‘Tam Hoa’ plum to lemon myrtle <b>oil</b> <b>vapour</b> concentrations of 25, 000 ppm, 30, 000 ppm and 40, 000 ppm at 20 oC and 25 oC for 2 hours significantly inhibited the growth of postharvest brown rot on artificially infected fruit. Phytotoxicity generally appeared as a result of concomitant high temperatures during treatment and high vapour concentrations. However, ‘Red Gold’ nectarines were most sensitive to lemon myrtle oil, with higher temperature treatments found to cause phytotoxicity in this variety even at lower vapour concentrations. Thus lower levels of lemon myrtle essential <b>oil</b> <b>vapour</b> are shown to be more active and toxic when treatment temperatures are increased from 20 oC to 25 oC. The experiment successfully established maximum tolerable <b>oil</b> <b>vapour</b> concentrations, treatment times and temperatures, which if exceeded could cause phytotoxicity.

Methods and Results: The disc diffusion method was used to screen the <b>oils</b> and <b>vapours</b> against three strains of A. butzleri. In vitro bergamot was the most inhibitory essential oil (EO) and both citral and linalool were effective. On cabbage leaf, the water isolate was the least susceptible to bergamot EO, citral and linalool (1 – 2 log reduction), with the chicken isolate being the most susceptible (6 – 8 log reduction). However, the latter appeared not to be susceptible to vapours over 24 h although type strain and water isolate populations reduced by 8 logs. On chicken skin, {{the effectiveness of the}} oils was reduced compared with that on cabbage leaf. Conclusions: Bergamot was the most effective of the oils tested and linalool the most effective component. All strains tested were less susceptible in food systems than in vitro.
