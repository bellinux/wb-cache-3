50|$|<b>Oxymetazoline</b> is a {{selective}} α1 adrenergic receptor agonist and α2 adrenergic receptor partial agonist. It is a topical decongestant, {{used in the}} form of <b>oxymetazoline</b> hydrochloride. It was developed from xylometazoline at E. Merck Darmstadt by Fruhstorfer in 1961. <b>Oxymetazoline</b> is generally available as a nasal spray.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxymetazoline</b> is {{available}} over-the-counter as a topical decongestant {{in the form}} of <b>oxymetazoline</b> hydrochloride in nasal sprays such as Otrivin, Afrin, Operil, Dristan, Dimetapp, Oxyspray, Facimin, Nasivin, Nostrilla, Sudafed OM, Vicks Sinex, Zicam, SinuFrin, and Mucinex Full Force.|$|E
50|$|It is {{recommended}} that <b>oxymetazoline</b> {{not be used for}} more than three days, as rebound congestion, or rhinitis medicamentosa, may occur. Patients who continue to use <b>oxymetazoline</b> beyond this point may become dependent on the medication to relieve their chronic congestion.|$|E

50|$|Imidazolines are {{sympathomimetic}} agents, {{with primary}} effects on α adrenergic receptors and {{little if any}} effect on β adrenergic receptors. <b>Oxymetazoline</b> is readily absorbed orally. Effects on α receptors from systemically absorbed <b>oxymetazoline</b> hydrochloride may persist for up to 7 hours after a single dose. The elimination half-life in humans is 5-8 hours. It is excreted unchanged both by the kidneys (30%) and in feces (10%).|$|E
5000|$|... 2-Imidazoline derivatives, such as <b>oxymetazoline,</b> may {{participate}} in negative feedback on endogenous norepinephrine production. Therefore, after cessation of prolonged use, {{there will be}} inadequate sympathetic vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa, and domination of parasympathetic activity can result in increased secretions and nasal edema. However, if <b>oxymetazoline</b> is used only nightly for allergic rhinitis, {{it can be used}} longer than one week without risk of rhinitis medicamentosa.|$|E

50|$|Decongestant nasal sprays and eye drops often contain <b>oxymetazoline</b> and {{are used}} for topical decongestion. Pseudoephedrine acts {{indirectly}} on the adrenergic receptor system, whereas phenylephrine and <b>oxymetazoline</b> are direct agonists. The effects {{are not limited to}} the nose, and these medicines may cause hypertension (high blood pressure) through vasoconstriction; {{it is for this reason}} that people with hypertension are advised to avoid them. Most decongestants, however, are not pronounced stimulants, due to lack of response from the other adrenoreceptors. Besides hypertension, common side-effects include sleeplessness, anxiety, dizziness, excitability, and nervousness.|$|E
50|$|If accidentally ingested, {{standard}} {{methods to}} remove unabsorbed drugs should be considered. There is no specific antidote for <b>oxymetazoline,</b> although its pharmacological effects may be reversed by α adrenergic antagonists such as phentolamine. In {{the event of}} a possibly life-threatening overdose (such as a hypertensive crisis), benzodiazepines should be considered to decrease the likelihood of seizures and convulsions, as well as reduce anxiety and to lower blood pressure. In children, <b>oxymetazoline</b> may produce profound central nervous system depression due to stimulation of central α2 receptors and imidazoline receptors, much like clonidine.|$|E
50|$|Due to its vasoconstricting properties, <b>oxymetazoline</b> is {{also used}} to treat nose bleeds and eye redness due to minor {{irritation}} (marketed as Visine L.R. in the form of eye drops).|$|E
50|$|Many imidazolines are biologically active. Most bio-active {{derivatives}} bear a substituent (aryl or alkyl group) on {{the carbon}} between the nitrogen centers. Some generic names include <b>oxymetazoline,</b> xylometazoline, tetrahydrozoline, and naphazoline.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{cold and}} flu {{medications}} containing decongestants may also contain pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, phenylephrine, naphazoline and <b>oxymetazoline.</b> These may {{be avoided by}} the use of decongestants formulated to prevent causing high blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|Phenylephrine {{is used as}} a {{decongestant}} sold as an oral {{medicine or}} as a nasal spray. It is a common ingredient in over-the-counter decongestants in the United States. Other decongestants include <b>oxymetazoline</b> and pseudoephedrine.|$|E
50|$|Some {{studies have}} found that {{benzalkonium}} chloride, a common additive to <b>oxymetazoline</b> nasal sprays, may damage nasal epithelia and exacerbate rhinitis medicamentosa. However, the majority of studies find benzalkonium chloride to be a safe preservative.|$|E
50|$|Use of {{intranasal}} decongestants (such as <b>oxymetazoline)</b> {{for more}} than three days leads to tachyphylaxis of response and rebound congestion, caused by alpha-adrenoceptor mediated down-regulation and desensitization of response. Oxymetazoline-induced tachyphylaxis and rebound congestion are reversed by intranasal fluticasone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxymetazoline</b> is a {{sympathomimetic}} that selectively agonizes α1 and, partially, α2 adrenergic receptors. Since vascular beds widely express α1 receptors, {{the action}} of <b>oxymetazoline</b> results in vasoconstriction. In addition, the local application of the drug also results in vasoconstriction due to its action on endothelial postsynaptic α2 receptors; systemic application of α2 agonists, in contrast, causes vasodilation because of centrally-mediated inhibition of sympathetic tone via presynaptic α2 receptors. Vasoconstriction of vessels results in relief of nasal congestion in two ways: first, it increases {{the diameter of the}} airway lumen; second, it reduces fluid exudation from postcapillary venules. It can reduce nasal airway resistance (NAR) up to 35.7% and nasal mucosal blood flow up to 50%.|$|E
50|$|Vicks Sinex is a {{brand of}} topical nasal {{decongestant}} spray produced by Vicks, a division of Procter & Gamble. The active ingredient contained in the Sinex nasal spray is <b>Oxymetazoline</b> which acts to relieve blocked nasal passages. The recommended dosage is 2-3 sprays in each nostril every 10-12 hours, though users should check the packaging for the specific product purchased. Excessive use of this product {{could lead to a}} dependency on it whereby the nasal passages block without use of <b>Oxymetazoline</b> again. Thus it is recommended that Sinex not be used for more than three days. Extra ingredients include camphor, eucalyptol, and menthol, which give Sinex Nasal Spray products the characteristic aroma of Vicks products but could also cause irritation of the mucous membrane.|$|E
50|$|Rhinitis medicamentosa (or RM) is a {{condition}} of rebound nasal congestion brought on by extended use of topical decongestants (e.g., <b>oxymetazoline,</b> phenylephrine, xylometazoline, and naphazoline nasal sprays) and certain oral medications (e.g., sympathomimetic amines and various 2-imidazolines) that constrict {{blood vessels in the}} lining of the nose.|$|E
50|$|The local {{application}} of a vasoconstrictive agent {{has been shown to}} reduce the bleeding time in benign cases of epistaxis. The drugs <b>oxymetazoline</b> or phenylephrine are widely available in over-the-counter nasal sprays for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, and they may be used for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|The Food and Drug Administration places <b>oxymetazoline</b> in {{category}} C, indicating risk to {{the fetus}} cannot be ruled out. While {{it has been shown}} that a single dose does not significantly alter either maternal or fetal circulation, this subject has not been studied extensively enough to draw reliable conclusions.|$|E
50|$|Rhinitis medicamentosa {{is a form}} of drug-induced nonallergic {{rhinitis}} {{which is}} associated with nasal congestion brought on by the use of certain oral medications (primarily sympathomimetic amine and 2-imidazoline derivatives) and topical decongestants (e.g., <b>oxymetazoline,</b> phenylephrine, xylometazoline, and naphazoline nasal sprays) that constrict the blood vessels in the lining of the nose.|$|E
50|$|Alpha-adrenergic {{agonists}} are {{the first}} treatment of choice. They relieve congestion by constricting the {{blood vessels in the}} nasal cavity, thus resulting in relieved symptoms. Examples include <b>oxymetazoline</b> and phenylephrine. Both influenza and the common cold are self-limiting conditions that improve with time; however, drugs such as acetaminophen (paracetamol), aspirin, and ibuprofen may help with the discomfort.|$|E
50|$|Breathing {{low-temperature}} steam such {{as from a}} {{hot shower}} or gargling can relieve symptoms. There is tentative evidence for nasal irrigation. Decongestant nasal sprays containing <b>oxymetazoline</b> may provide relief, but these medications {{should not be used}} for more than the recommended period.

50|$|Dristan 12-Hour Nasal Spray and Dristan Cold Multi-Symptom Tablets are {{medications}} made by Pfizer. Dristan 12-Hour Nasal Spray is a nasal decongestant, {{the active}} ingredient of which is <b>oxymetazoline</b> hydrochloride 0.05%. Dristan Cold Multi-Symptom Tablets contain three active ingredients: acetaminophen, USP 325 mg (a pain reliever and fever reducer), chlorpheniramine maleate, USP 2 mg (an antihistamine), and phenylephrine HCl, USP 5 mg (a nasal decongestant).|$|E
50|$|Bronchospasm {{are caused}} {{by a number of}} reasons. Lower {{respiratory}} tract conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and emphysema can result in contraction of the airways. Other causes are side effects of topical decongestants such as <b>oxymetazoline</b> and phenylephrine. Both of these medications activate alpha-1 adrenergic receptors that result in smooth muscle constriction. Non-selective beta blockers are known to facilitate bronchospasm as well. Beta blockers bind into the β2 receptors and block the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine from binding to its receptors, causing shortness of breath.|$|E
50|$|Many {{patients}} {{seeking a}} quick form of relief achieved it by rinsing the nose with a saline solution. This treatment option is easily available {{and can be}} repeated several times throughout the day to obtain relief. An example of a nasal spray {{that can be used}} to alleviate symptoms is <b>Oxymetazoline</b> HCl, which seems to provide relief for a longer time period. The relief achieved by the use of nasal sprays seems to be because it results in the blockage of the nostril that does not allow any air to enter the olfactory cleft.|$|E
50|$|The <b>oxymetazoline</b> brand Afrin {{was first}} {{sold as a}} {{prescription}} medication in 1966. After finding substantial early success as a prescription medication, it became available as an over-the-counter drug in 1975. Schering-Plough did not engage in heavy advertising until 1986. From the late 1980s to mid 1990s, Afrin featured in many notable television advertisements. Some of these commercials showed men, women, and children using other brands of nasal sprays, and then standing upside down or hanging upside down from playground equipment to prevent their nasal spray from dripping out. This was juxtaposed with Afrin users having no problems.|$|E
