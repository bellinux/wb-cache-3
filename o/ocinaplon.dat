50|$|The {{mechanism}} of action by which <b>ocinaplon</b> produces its anxiolytic effects is by modulating GABAA receptors, although <b>ocinaplon</b> is more subtype-selective than most benzodiazepines.|$|E
50|$|Development of <b>ocinaplon</b> is {{discontinued}} due to liver {{complications that}} occurred {{in one of the}} Phase III subjects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ocinaplon</b> is an {{anxiolytic}} {{drug in the}} pyrazolopyrimidine {{family of}} drugs. Other pyrazolopyrimidine drugs include zaleplon and indiplon.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ocinaplon</b> has {{a similar}} {{pharmacological}} profile to the benzodiazepine family of drugs, but with mainly anxiolytic properties and relatively little sedative or amnestic effect.|$|E
5000|$|Condensation of 4-Acetylpyridine with N,N-Dimethylformamide {{dimethyl}} acetal (DMFDMA) gives the [...] "enamide" [...] (3). This is then condensed with (3-Amino-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)(2-pyridinyl)methanone (4) (96219-90-8). This {{is the same}} intermediate as {{was used in the}} synthesis of zaleplon in which the nitrile is replaced by a 2-acetylpyridil moiety. This affords the anxiolytic agent <b>ocinaplon</b> (5).|$|E
40|$|Benzodiazepines remain {{widely used}} for the {{treatment}} of anxiety disorders despite prominent, often limiting side effects including sedation, muscle relaxation, and ataxia. A compound producing a robust anxiolytic action comparable to benzodiazepines, but lacking these limiting side effects at therapeutic doses (an anxioselective agent), would represent an important advance in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, and perhaps other anxiety disorders. Here we report that the pyrazolo[1, 5 -a]-pyrimidine, <b>ocinaplon,</b> exhibits an anxioselective profile in both preclinical procedures and in patients with generalized anxiety disorder, the most common of the anxiety disorders. In rats, <b>ocinaplon</b> produces significant muscle relaxation, ataxia, and sedation only at doses > 25 -fold higher than the minimum effective dose (3. 1 mg/kg) in the Vogel “conflict” test. This anticonflict effect is blocked by flumazenil (Ro 15 - 1788), indicating that like benzodiazepines, <b>ocinaplon</b> produces an anxiolytic action through allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors. Nonetheless, in eight recombinant GABAA receptor isoforms expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the potency and efficacy of <b>ocinaplon</b> to potentiate GABA responses varied with subunit composition not only in an absolute sense, but also relative to the prototypical benzodiazepine, diazepam. In a double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial, a 2 -week regimen of <b>ocinaplon</b> (total daily dose of 180 - 240 mg) produced statistically significant reductions in the Hamilton rating scale for anxiety scores. In this study, the incidence of benzodiazepine-like side effects (e. g., sedation, dizziness) in ocinaplon-treated patients did not differ from placebo. These findings indicate that <b>ocinaplon</b> represents a unique approach both for the treatment and understanding of anxiety disorders...|$|E
40|$|Background Compounds {{targeting}} the benzodiazepine binding {{site of the}} GABA A -R are widely prescribed {{for the treatment of}} anxiety disorders, epilepsy, and insomnia as well as for pre-anesthetic sedation and muscle relaxation. It has been hypothesized that these various pharmacological effects are mediated by different GABA A -R subtypes. If this hypothesis is correct, then {{it may be possible to}} develop compounds targeting particular GABA A -R subtypes as, for example, selective anxiolytics with a diminished side effect profile. The pyrazolo[1, 5 -a]-pyrimidine <b>ocinaplon</b> is anxioselective in both preclinical studies and in patients with generalized anxiety disorder, but does not exhibit the selectivity between α 1 /α 2 -containing receptors for an anxioselective that is predicted by studies using transgenic mice. Results We hypothesized that the pharmacological properties of <b>ocinaplon</b> in vivo might be influenced by an active biotransformation product with greater selectivity for the α 2 subunit relative to α 1. One hour after administration of <b>ocinaplon,</b> the plasma concentration of its primary biotransformation product, DOV 315, 090, is 38 % of the parent compound. The pharmacological properties of DOV 315, 090 were assessed using radioligand binding studies and two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology. We report that DOV 315, 090 possesses modulatory activity at GABA A -Rs, but that its selectivity profile is similar to that of <b>ocinaplon.</b> Conclusion These findings imply that DOV 315, 090 could contribute to the action of <b>ocinaplon</b> in vivo, but that the anxioselective properties of <b>ocinaplon</b> cannot be readily explained by a subtype selective effect/action of DOV 315, 090. Further inquiry is required to identify the extent to which different subtypes are involved in the anxiolytic and other pharmacological effects of GABA A -R modulators. </p...|$|E
