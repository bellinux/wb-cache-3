5|$|A precise {{description}} {{and interpretation of}} the work has remained elusive since its initial discovery in the 19th century. Scholars agree on some aspects and disagree on others. British Greek art scholar Martin Robertson notes that both women can be seen wearing the tubular peplos garment common to the Classical period. According to the descriptive text found in the Atlas database of the exhibited works <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>at</b> the Louvre, the women also are wearing a kekryphalos, a hairnet in the Greco-Roman hairstyle, and appear to hold a type of flower, perhaps poppy or pomegranate. One {{of the women in}} the stele carries what resembles a bag, presumed to be carrying seeds in the interpretation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Harry {{obtained}} a place at Liverpool's College <b>of</b> <b>Art</b> <b>at</b> 68 Hope Street. After studying typography and page layouts, he borrowed the college's duplicating machine and published a newspaper called Jazz in 1958, which reported concerts at the Liverpool Jazz Society club, the Temple Jazz Club and the Cavern Club. He also worked as assistant editor on University of Liverpool's charity magazine, Pantosphinx, and on a music newsletter for Frank Hessy's musical instruments store called Frank Comments. The title was suggested by the owner, Frank Hesselberg, as a play on his own comments, but was abandoned after a few issues.|$|E

5|$|Stoddart {{was born}} in Edinburgh and raised in Renfrewshire, where he {{developed}} an early interest {{in the arts and}} music, and later trained in fine art at the Glasgow School of Art (1976–1980) and read the History <b>of</b> <b>Art</b> <b>at</b> the University of Glasgow. During this time he became increasingly critical of contemporary trends in art, such as pop art, and concentrated on creating figurine pieces in clay. Stoddart associates the lack of form in modern art with social decay; in contrast, his works include many classical allusions.|$|E
5|$|The {{symmetry}} {{on earth}} mirrors the symmetric perfection of heaven. The purpose <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>at</b> this time—in architecture, the visual arts, and music—was {{not to create}} something entirely new, but to reflect this divine perfection, {{and in this way}} to praise God. We find such a symmetric outline in many pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach,19 but only in a few cases is this outline as consequent as in the B Minor Mass. The parts Kyrie, Gloria and Credo are all designed with choral sections as the outer movements, framing an intimate center of theological significance.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, Skagen {{became the}} summer venue of a group of artists who were {{attracted}} by the way of life in the fishing village and by the opportunities for painting the fishermen and surrounding landscapes. Skagens Museum was founded on 20 October 1908 in the dining room at Brøndums Hotel. Among the founders were artists Michael Ancher, P.S. Krøyer and Laurits Tuxen, who were elected to form the first board of governors together with Victor Christian Klæbel, the local pharmacist, and Degn Brøndum, who was the proprietor of Brøndums Hotel and brother of Anna Ancher. In 1982, the exhibition rooms were extended with an annex designed by the Royal Surveyor, architect Jacob Blegvad. Blegvad also planned the later extension to the museum that was inaugurated in 1989. Today Skagens Museum has more than 1,900 works <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>at</b> its disposal.|$|E
