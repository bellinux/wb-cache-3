Closed simulations for {{the determination of the}} dynamic responses of the harvester boom during luffing motion considering the cylinder drive system and luffing angle position control have been realized. Using the ADAMS mechanical system dynamics analysis software, six different arm poses were selected and simulated based on the cylinder as the analysis object.

The movement of the <b>oil</b> <b>cylinder</b> under different conditions were analyzed, and the main operation dimensions of the harvester boom and the force condition of the <b>oil</b> <b>cylinder</b> were obtained. The calculation results show that the dynamic responses of the boom are more sensitive to the luffing acceleration, in comparison with the luffing velocity. It is seen that this method is very effective and convenient for boom luffing simulation.

40|$|Abstract. From the {{perspective}} of stress and heat distribution, the influence of material and heat on working reliability of the turret seal is analysed. Based on the actual working condition of a servo turret, the FEA (finite element analysis) of structural mechanics and thermal structural coupling is carried out on the key reciprocating seal between piston and <b>oil</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The analysis re that material hardness and temperature have great influence on the seal contact pressure and the leakage. To be specific, the lower seal material hardness leads to the lower maximum contact stress and longer seal’s service life without increasing the net leakage under 3. 5 Mpa oil pressure. The result demonstrates that the material with hardness 90 is better than that with hardness 95 under the hydraulic pressure 3. 5 Mpa. Besides, temperature distribution of seal under the working condition is gained through the thermal structural coupling analysis. It is concluded that increasing temperature lead to decreased leakage and enhanced contact stress. Consequently, {{the influence of the}} temperature should be taken into consideration on the research of seal numerical model...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In the {{traditional}} {{design of the}} working equipment of the hydraulic excavator, its stress distribution was almost determined by adopting the static calculation method, and then its strength was ensured by selecting the safety factor, which is not fully considered because of the dynamic stresses resulting from shocks and vibrations in the operating process of the hydraulic excavator. Based on the finite element analysis software ANSYS, the 3 D models of the main components (boom and bucket rod) of the working equipment for certain type of hydraulic excavator were analyzed. The inherent frequency and the main vibration mode were analyzed by extracting the first 6 -th order modal. The research results show that {{with the increase of}} modal order, the vibrating mode form increased in complexity. The first and the second orders vibrating mode can be both a linear bending deformation or muster within a certain plane individually. From the beginning of the third order, the model deflection begins to become a mutual coupling complex vibrating type which showed multiple orders of bending and torsion deformation. The maximum deflection of boom is concentrated near the ear plate as well as the hinge point connected with boom and <b>oil</b> <b>cylinder.</b> On the other sides, the maximum deflection of bucket rod is concentrated on its middle part. i. e. between the hinge joints of rocker and the ear plate as well as near the rear supporting plate. Therefore, in order to ensure strength and working safety of the working equipment, it is necessary to improve the structure of the maximum deformation. The Modal analysis provides important modal parameters for the corresponding analysis of the boom and bucket rod of the working equipment in hydraulic excavator, and provides a basi...|$|E
