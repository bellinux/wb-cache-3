40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} study into {{the effects of}} using recycled Polyamide 12 (PA 12) powder on the manufacture of a Selective Laser Sintered (SLS) part. It was found that through using recycled PA 12 material, a poor and unacceptable surface finish was achieved. The aim {{of this paper is}} therefore to develop a strategy to ideally eliminate the coarse surface texture found on the product (<b>Orange</b> <b>Peel</b> <b>effect)</b> by controlling the most important SLS process parameters. The reason for employing the strategy is to ensure consistent surface quality of the resultant parts and more efficient use of the SLS recycled material. A suitable laser scanning strategy and energy density value along with an appropriate recycled material was chosen as the main process parameters. In this experiment 3 replications were experimentally tested. PA 12 recycled materials with a Melt Flow Rate (MFR) of 18 - 19 MFR and 15 - 16 MFR were used in the experiments. An in-house surface texture scoring system was introduced to evaluate the surface quality produced on the parts. This paper extends the understanding of the SLS process and in particular the relationship between the SLS parameters and part quality. The experimental results suggest that through employing an effective laser scanning strategy and energy density value, the resulting part surface quality was improved. The proposed method provides a threshold MFR value for the PA 12 powder and shows that materials with MFR values lower than 18 MFR created parts of poor and unacceptable surface quality...|$|E

30|$|Several {{works have}} been done on {{essential}} oil and pectin extractions from <b>orange</b> <b>peels,</b> though the <b>effects</b> of processing factors on the extractions were not considered in some. Ezejiofor et al. (2011) worked on essential oil extraction from <b>orange</b> <b>peels.</b> Also, Hashmi et al. (2012) studied essential oil and pectin extraction from sweet orange. Nonetheless, the reports did not study the influence of processing factors on the oil and pectin yields. The effects {{of one of the}} process parameters on pectin yield during extraction from <b>orange</b> <b>peels</b> have been studied by several researchers. Pandharipande and Makode (2012) worked on the separation of oil and pectin from <b>orange</b> <b>peel</b> and studied the effect of pH on the pectin yield. Njoku and Evbuomwan (2014) considered the effect of extraction time on oil extracted from orange, lemon, and lime peels. Yadav et al. (2017) also studied the effects of pH on pectin yield extraction from sweet lime peels. In the above studies, other processing factors were not considered. According to Fan et al. (2011), the traditional one-factor-at-a-time approach is time-consuming and is almost impossible to achieve the true optimal conditions; therefore, it seems unrealistic to optimize the essential oil and pectin extraction processes using that approach. Some researchers studied the effects of more processing factors on pectin yield during extraction from orange peels; howbeit, the processing parameters were not optimized. Dehankar et al. (2015) studied the removal of essential oil and extraction of pectin. For the latter, the pH, process period, and solvent used were considered but not optimized. El-Nawawi and Shehata (1987) and Rehmann et al. (2004) investigated the effects of temperature, pH, and duration on pectin extraction from <b>orange</b> and mango <b>peels,</b> respectively. However, the process was not optimized. Nevertheless, there have been reports on the optimization of processing factors on pectin extraction from other fruit peels. Kliemann et al. (2009) optimized the effects of temperature, pH, and extraction time on pectin acid extraction from passion fruit peel. Tang et al.

40|$|The surface {{topography}} of a bulk material {{is not only}} responsible for its optical appearance; {{it also has a}} strong influence on its physical properties like tensile strength or corrosion resistance. The topography develops during deformation due to extrinsic effects like tool-contact or due to intrinsic effects like microstructure related inhomogeneous deformation. The object of this investigation is {{to examine the relationship between}} microstructure and surface roughness during compressive and tensile deformation. The formation of the matt surface during foil rolling was taken as an example for the compressive deformation and the one-dimensional tensile test was taken as an example for the tensile deformation. The potential applicability of the crystal-plasticity finite element method was tested with regard to microstructure dependent roughness evolution. The microstructure was characterized with EBSD (electron backscattering diffraction) in a high resolution SEM with a field emission gun. The topography was measured using a white light confocal microscope. A small tensile test frame was constructed for use with the confocal microscope thus allowing in-situ surface measurements during tensile testing. The local strain distribution was calculated from the topographic dataset with a photogravimetric method. The foil rolling experiments showed an exponential relation between the roughness of the matt side and the strain. Neither the rolling velocity nor the viscosity of the rolling lubricant had a direct effect on the evolution of the matt side. An increase of the rolling force and a decrease of the viscosity of the separating lubricant reduced the roughness of the matt side because of the shift to from hydrodynamic lubrication to mixed lubrication. The homogenisation procedure after continuous casting and the modification of the chemical composition of the alloy has a strong influence on the roughness. A fine globular grain or subgrain structure has a positive effect. Such a microstructure evolves if a high volume fraction of fine particles is present. The type and fraction of precipitates was simulated with the Calphad-method. The influence of the iron, silicon, manganese and magnesium content on the roughening behaviour was investigated. Two different mechanisms were found for the roughness evolution during tensile testing. As a result of the grain structure a valley and hill structure was formed parallel to the tensile direction. In agreement with earlier publications a linear relation between roughness and strain was found. The second mechanism is based on the formation of shear bands. This leads to a surface texture, which is transverse to the tensile direction and shows an exponential relation to the strain. A method based on the classification of the localized necking of a tensile specimen was developed for the estimation of the roughening tendency of a material. With this method it is possible to make a first approximation of the roughening behaviour of an alloy during rolling without cost intensive rolling experiments. This could be advantageously used during alloy development. With a simple model the possibilities of the implementation of a crystal plasticity material law into the finite element simulation were demonstrated. The model can be used for the simulation of the <b>orange</b> <b>peel</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|E
