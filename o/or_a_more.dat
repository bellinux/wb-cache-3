5|$|Changing the {{relative}} {{phase of the}} subwoofer {{with respect to the}} woofers in other speakers may or may not help to minimize unwanted destructive acoustic interference in the frequency region covered by both subwoofer and main speakers. It may not help at all frequencies, and may create further problems with frequency response, but is even so generally provided as an adjustment for subwoofer amplifiers. Phase control circuits may be a simple polarity reversal switch <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> complex continuously variable circuits.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} motivation {{or driving}} force behind the re-establishment of religious houses in the kingdom of the English, living in strict accordance with the Rule of Saint Benedict, was a desire to restore to their former glory some of the ancient houses known from the pages of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, from other literary works, from historical traditions of the later eighth and ninth centuries, or indeed from the physical remains of buildings... Modern historians will recognise how much was owed to the monastic reform movements on the continent, and will find extra dimensions, such as a wish to extend royal influence into areas where a king of the West Saxons might not expect his writ to run, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> general wish to revive a sense of 'Englishness', through raising awareness of the tradition of the past.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{should not}} be taken by people who are {{allergic}} to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin {{should not be}} given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.|$|E

5|$|Mimas, the {{innermost}} {{of the round}} moons of Saturn and directly interior to Enceladus, is a geologically dead body, even though it should experience stronger tidal forces than Enceladus. This apparent paradox can be explained in part by temperature-dependent properties of water ice (the main constituent of the interiors of Mimas and Enceladus). The tidal heating per unit mass is given by the formula , where ρ is the (mass) density of the satellite, n is its mean orbital motion, r is the satellite's radius, e is the orbital eccentricity of the satellite, μ is the shear modulus and Q is the dimensionless dissipation factor. For a same-temperature approximation, the expected value of qtid for Mimas is about 40 times that of Enceladus. However, the material parameters μ and Q are temperature dependent. At high temperatures (close to the melting point), μ and Q are low, so tidal heating is high. Modeling suggests that for Enceladus, both a 'basic' low-energy thermal state with little internal temperature gradient, and an 'excited' high-energy thermal state with a significant temperature gradient, and consequent convection (endogenic geologic activity), once established, would be stable. For Mimas, only a low-energy state {{is expected to be}} stable, despite its being closer to Saturn. So the model predicts a low-internal-temperature state for Mimas (values of μ and Q are high) but a possible higher-temperature state for Enceladus (values of μ and Q are low). Additional historical information is needed to explain how Enceladus first entered the high-energy state (e.g. more radiogenic heating <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> eccentric orbit in the past).|$|E
5|$|The 2010 census {{estimated}} that 1,057 people in Omak have attended college, while 504 residents received an academic degree; {{more than five}} {{percent higher than the}} state average. Approximately 91.5 percent graduated from high school <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> advanced institution; two percent higher than the state average. Omak's schools are administered by the county's largest educational district, Omak School District, which operate two mainstream high schools, one mainstream middle school, two mainstream elementary schools and three virtual schools. Omak High School, built in 1919, had a 2010–11 enrollment of 435 students, while the Omak Alternative High School had an enrollment of 48 students. In contrast to the municipal average as a whole with 2,540 females and 2,305 males, Omak Alternative High School had 28 males and 20 females attending the institution. Omak Middle School, with an enrolment of 339 children, had 171 males and 169 females in the 2010–11 school season. The city's primary schools are East Omak Elementary and North Omak Elementary which had a combined 2010–11 enrollment of 748 children.|$|E
