5|$|Anthozoan larvae {{either have}} large yolks or {{are capable of}} feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding {{capabilities}} extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding <b>of</b> <b>sites.</b> Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.|$|E
5|$|Cuba's {{inclusions}} on {{the list}} include a variety <b>of</b> <b>sites.</b> Two sites are selected for their natural significance: Alejandro de Humboldt National Park in the eastern provinces of Holguín and Guantánamo, and Desembarco del Granma National Park, named for the yacht which carried {{the members of the}} 26th of July Movement who started the Cuban Revolution. City landscapes include Old Havana, Trinidad, and Camagüey, all founded by early Spanish colonists in the 16th century. The sites also include historical agricultural regions, including the coffee plantations of southeastern Cuba, and the tobacco region of Viñales Valley.|$|E
40|$|The Bachelor´s thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{operating}} costs <b>of</b> <b>site</b> equipment. The theoretical section provides the information about the function, the structure and the process <b>of</b> <b>site</b> equipment design, and then it also describes the costs associated with equipment construction site. The practical part is focused on design <b>of</b> <b>site</b> equipment and its operating costs calculation. The comparison <b>of</b> designed <b>site</b> equipment with the real operation is mentioned in the final part...|$|R

5|$|Eastern Africa {{represents}} some of {{the most}} reliable dates, due to the use of radiocarbon dating on volcanic ash deposits, as well as {{some of the}} earliest MSA sites. Faunal preservation, however, is not spectacular, and standardization in site excavation and lithic classification was, until recently, lacking. Unlike northern Africa, shifts between lithic technologies were not nearly as pronounced, likely due to more favorable climatic conditions that would have allowed for more continuous occupation <b>of</b> <b>sites.</b> Central Africa reflects similar patterning to eastern Africa, yet more archaeological research of the region is certainly required.|$|E
5|$|Ethnographies also caution against over-interpretation <b>of</b> <b>sites.</b> At {{a site in}} Chaco Canyon can {{be found}} a {{pictograph}} with a star, crescent and hand. It has been argued by some astronomers {{that this is a}} record of the 1054 Supernova. However recent reexaminations of related 'supernova petroglyphs' raises questions about such sites in general and anthropological evidence suggests other inrepretations. The Zuni people, who claim a strong ancestral affiliation with Chaco, marked their sun-watching station with a crescent, star, hand and sundisc, similar to those found at the Chaco site.|$|E
5|$|In February 1994 (when {{air strikes}} were {{originally}} threatened), NATO {{had created a}} heavy weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo, and collected weapons at a number <b>of</b> <b>sites.</b> On 5 August, the VRS seized several weapons from the Illidža Weapons Collection site in clear violation of the exclusion zone agreement. During the seizure, Serb forces injured a Ukrainian UNPROFOR peacekeeper. In response to the attack, the UN once again requested NATO air support. Two U.S. A-10 aircraft repeatedly strafed Serb targets, and the Serbs returned the seized weapons to the collection site.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe have {{reported}} previously that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates two sites on acetyl-CoA carboxylase (site 1 : Arg-Met-Ser(P) -Phe, and site 2 : Ser-Ser(P) -Met-Ser-Gly-Leu), while the AMP-activated protein kinase also phosphorylates site 1, plus site 3 (Ser-Ser-Met-Ser(P) -Gly-Leu), {{the latter being}} two residues C-terminal to site 2. We now report that prior phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>site</b> 2 by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase prevents the subsequent phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>site</b> 3 and the consequent large decrease in Vmax produced by the AMP-activated protein kinase. Similarly, prior phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>site</b> 3 by the AMP-activated protein kinase prevents subsequent phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>site</b> 2 by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase...|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 13thcentury, Crusader castles were mostly built by Military Orders {{including}} the Knights Hospitaller, Knights Templar, and Teutonic Knights. The orders {{were responsible for}} the foundation <b>of</b> <b>sites</b> such as Krak des Chevaliers, Margat, and Belvoir. Design varied not just between orders, but between individual castles, though it was common for those founded in this period to have concentric defences.|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} Italian Alps, the Alpine chough nests {{in a greater}} variety <b>of</b> <b>sites</b> than red-billed chough, using natural cliffs, pot-holes and {{abandoned}} buildings, whereas the red-billed uses only natural cliffs (although it nests in old buildings elsewhere). The Alpine chough lays its eggs about one month later than its relative, although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Norte Chico {{sites are}} notable for {{exceptional}} collective density, {{as well as}} individual size. Haas argues that the density <b>of</b> <b>sites</b> in such a small area is globally unique for a nascent civilization. During the third millennium BC, Norte Chico may have been the most densely populated area of the world (excepting, possibly, northern China). The Supe, Pativilca, Fortaleza, and Huaura River valleys each have several related sites.|$|E

5|$|The central Petén {{style of}} {{architecture}} is modelled {{after the great}} city of Tikal. The style is characterized by tall pyramids supporting a summit shrine adorned with a roof comb, and accessed by a single doorway. Additional features are the use of stela-altar pairings, and the decoration of architectural façades, lintels, and roof combs with relief sculptures of rulers and gods. One of the finest examples of Central Petén style architecture is Tikal Temple I. Examples <b>of</b> <b>sites</b> in the Central Petén style include Altun Ha, Calakmul, Holmul, Ixkun, Nakum, Naranjo, and Yaxhá.|$|E
5|$|The first World War I {{air raid}} on London, Operation Turkenkreuz, {{took place on}} 13 June 1917, when 20 Gotha G.IV bombers {{attacked}} the capital. The raid struck a number <b>of</b> <b>sites</b> including Liverpool Street. Seven tons of explosives were dropped on the station, killing 162 people and injuring 432. Three bombs hit the station, of which two exploded, having fallen through the train shed roof, near to two trains, causing multiple fatalities. It was the deadliest single raid on Britain during the war.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>sites</b> that were {{previously}} listed as being in danger, but they were later removed from the list after improvements in management and conservation. The Everglades National Park was listed from 1993 to 2007 and again since 2010; the Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve was listed from 1996 to 2007 and again since 2011. Both are therefore included {{in the list of}} currently listed sites (above).|$|E

5|$|This civilization flourished at the {{confluence}} of three rivers, the Fortaleza, the Pativilca, and the Supe. These river valleys each have large clusters <b>of</b> <b>sites.</b> Further south, there are several associated sites along the Huaura River. The alternative name, Caral-Supe, {{is derived from the}} city of Caral in the Supe Valley, a large and well-studied Norte Chico site. Complex society in Norte Chico arose a millennium after Sumer in Mesopotamia, was contemporaneous with the Egyptian pyramids, and predated the Mesoamerican Olmec by nearly two millennia.|$|E
5|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>sites</b> {{associated}} with Macdonald are preserved. His gravesite {{has been designated}} a National Historic Site of Canada. Bellevue House in Kingston, where the Macdonald family lived in the 1840s, is also a National Historic Site administered by Parks Canada, and has been restored to that time period. His Ottawa home, Earnscliffe, still stands and is today the official residence of the British High Commissioner to Canada. Statues have been erected to Macdonald across Canada; one stands on Parliament Hill in Ottawa (by Louis-Philippe Hebert c. 1895). A statue of Macdonald stands atop a granite plinth originally intended for a statue of Queen Victoria in Toronto's Queen's Park, looking south on University Avenue. Macdonald's statue also stands in Kingston's City Park; the Kingston Historical Society annually holds a memorial service in his honour.|$|E
5|$|After {{the city}} was {{captured}} by British forces during World War I, Nablus was incorporated into the British Mandate of Palestine in 1922. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, {{the city was}} captured and occupied by Transjordan, which subsequently annexed it unilaterally, until its occupation by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. Today, the population is predominantly Muslim, with small Christian and Samaritan minorities. Since 1995, {{the city has been}} governed by the Palestinian National Authority. In the Old City, there are a number <b>of</b> <b>sites</b> of archaeological significance, spanning the 1st to 15th centuries.
