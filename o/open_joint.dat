25|$|When Richard Nixon {{selected}} Melvin Laird as his Secretary of Defense {{in early}} 1969, Laird directed the Department of Defense {{to undertake a}} comprehensive review of U.S. biological warfare (BW) programs. Laird's push for a review of both the chemical and biological programs arose when Congress attempted to push the Pentagon for <b>open,</b> <b>joint</b> Congressional hearings on chemical-biological warfare (CBW). The Pentagon balked and the result was Laird's memo to National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger urging a review of those weapons programs.|$|E
2500|$|When Vladivostok Air {{celebrated its}} 15th anniversary as an <b>open</b> <b>joint</b> stock company on 20 January 2009, it had {{transformed}} from a regional carrier into the largest company in the Russian Far East and [...] East Siberia. Passenger numbers increased to over 900,000 annually because of fleet expansion and modernisation. June 2009 saw {{the introduction of the}} first long-haul Airbus A330-300 service, connecting Vladivostok and Moscow, with more A320's and A330's expected to join the fleet between October 2009 and the summer of 2010. Orders for four Antonov An-148 with two options were placed at the 2009 MAKS Airshow.|$|E

50|$|The {{volume of}} the newly created array of <b>opened</b> <b>joints</b> within the HDR {{reservoir}} is much less than 1% of the {{volume of the}} pressure-stimulated rock mass. As these joints continue to pressure-dilate, the overall flow impedance across the reservoir becomes very low, leading to a high thermal productivity.|$|R

50|$|The <b>open</b> head <b>joint</b> {{process is}} done by leaving out mortar from the <b>joints.</b> This create <b>open</b> holes {{of the same size}} of the typical spacing of the joints. This is the most common method and most {{effective}} way to evaporate water from the cavity. The spacing between <b>open</b> head <b>joints</b> can be done at every 24 in. One of the problems with this method is that the <b>open</b> head <b>joints</b> create large holes which may not be appealing. Some maintenance workers may also inadvertently patch those holes up without realizing they are weep holes. There are some products such as aluminum vent and plastic grid that can be inserted into the weep holes to make them less conspicuous.|$|R

40|$|Geological {{investigations}} and seismic refraction tomography reveal {{a series of}} 70 ° steep, parallel and continuous fractures at 2950 m asl within the Gemsstock rock ridge (Central Swiss Alps), at the lower fringe of alpine permafrost. Temperature measurements in a 40 m horizontal borehole through {{the base of the}} ridge show that whilst conductive heat transfer dominates within the rock mass, brief negative and positive temperature anomalies are registered in summer. These have very small amplitudes and coincide with summer rainfall events lasting longer than 12 h. In contrast, a complete lack of anomalous thermal signals during spring snowmelt suggests that runoff does not penetrate the <b>open</b> <b>joints,</b> despite high snow water equivalents of around 400 mm. This is attributed to the development of an approximately 20 cm thick, continuous and impermeable basal ice layer which forms at the interface between the snow cover and the cold rock on the shady North facing rock wall during snowmelt. Spring snowmelt water therefore does not affect rock temperatures in the centre of the rock mass, despite the presence of deep <b>open</b> <b>joints.</b> The mechanical impact of snowmelt infiltration on rock wall stability at depth is thus assumed to be negligible at this site...|$|R

40|$|Walls of {{excavations}} in the Bandelier Tuff for pipelines {{and foundations}} for structures provide excellent areas {{to determine the}} orientation (strike and dip) and characteristics of the joints (frequency, width, and type of material filling the joint). Joints or fractures are commonly associated with structural adjustments such as faulting; however, joints formed in the tuff mainly result from the shrinkage of the ash-flow tuff as it cools. The presence of faults can restrict the siting of buildings or structures. In waste disposal operations, <b>open</b> <b>joints</b> can be pathways for the transport of contaminants...|$|R
