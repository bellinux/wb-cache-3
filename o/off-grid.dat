5|$|<b>Off-grid</b> system {{users can}} either adapt to {{intermittent}} power or use batteries, photovoltaic or diesel systems {{to supplement the}} wind turbine. Equipment such as parking meters, traffic warning signs, street lighting, or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a small wind turbine, possibly combined with a photovoltaic system, that charges a small battery replacing {{the need for a}} connection to the power grid.|$|E
5|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of electricity produced worldwide is used immediately, since storage is usually more expensive and because traditional generators can adapt to demand. However both solar power and wind power are variable renewable energy, meaning that all available output must be taken whenever it is available by moving through transmission lines to {{where it can be}} used now. Since solar energy is not available at night, storing its energy is potentially an important issue particularly in <b>off-grid</b> and for future 100% renewable energy scenarios to have continuous electricity availability.|$|E
5|$|Wind farms {{consist of}} many {{individual}} wind turbines which {{are connected to}} the electric power transmission network. Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electric power, competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants. Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land, and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher. Small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electric power to isolated <b>off-grid</b> locations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Off-grid</b> PV {{systems have}} {{traditionally}} used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity {{can be sent}} to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.|$|E

25|$|According to the World Bank, the {{potential}} for the development of <b>off-grid</b> and small renewable sources largely unexploited, {{due to a lack of}} incentives and clear and consistent policy framework.|$|E
25|$|With a major {{section of}} its {{citizens}} still surviving <b>off-grid,</b> India's grid system is considerably under-developed. Availability of cheap solar can bring electricity to people, and bypass the need of installation of expensive grid lines.|$|E
25|$|In Bolivia, the National Interconnected System (SIN) connects major {{population}} centers and represents 83% of the installed capacity. The SIN provides electricity {{to the largest}} cities and operates in the Departments of Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, Oruro, Potosí and Chuquisaca. Its grid extends over 1,200 miles and covers the central and southern {{parts of the country}}. The population in the northern and western parts of the country remains largely unconnected to the national grid, either served by the <b>off-grid</b> system (the Aislado) or having no access to electricity at all. The <b>off-grid</b> system consists of numerous self producers and independent power plants in rural or isolated areas.|$|E
25|$|Autonomous {{buildings}} are usually energy-efficient in operation, and therefore cost-efficient, for the obvious reason that smaller energy needs {{are easier to}} satisfy <b>off-grid.</b> But they may substitute energy production or other techniques to avoid diminishing returns in extreme conservation.|$|E
25|$|The {{companies}} {{that belong to}} the National Interconnected System (SIN) must be vertically unbundled. However, the companies in the <b>off-grid</b> system (the Aislado) are allowed to perform {{more than one of}} the activities defined in the electricity industry (i.e. generation, transmission, distribution).|$|E
25|$|Hydro-Québec Distribution is also {{responsible}} {{for the production of}} power in remote communities not connected to the main power grid. The division operates an <b>off-grid</b> hydroelectric dam serving communities on the Lower North Shore and 23 small diesel power plants in the Magdalen Islands, in Haute-Mauricie and in Nunavik.|$|E
25|$|Renewable {{energy is}} energy that is {{collected}} from renewable resources, which are naturally replenished {{on a human}} timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas: electricity generation, air and water heating/cooling, transportation, and rural (<b>off-grid)</b> energy services.|$|E
25|$|In {{isolated}} rural areas, {{electricity grid}} extensions {{are often not}} economical. <b>Off‐grid</b> renewable technologies provide a sustainable and cost‐effective alternative to the diesel generators that would be otherwise be deployed in such areas. Renewable technologies can also help to displace other unsustainable energy sources such as kerosene lamps and traditional biomass.|$|E
25|$|Renewable {{energy is}} {{generally}} defined as energy {{that comes from}} resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves and geothermal heat. Renewable energy replaces conventional fuels in four distinct areas: electricity generation, hot water/space heating, motor fuels, and rural (<b>off-grid)</b> energy services.|$|E
25|$|Renewable {{energy is}} {{generally}} defined as energy {{that comes from}} resources that are not significantly depleted by their use, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves and geothermal heat. Renewable energy is gradually replacing conventional fuels in four distinct areas: electricity generation, hot water/space heating, motor fuels, and rural (<b>off-grid)</b> energy services.|$|E
25|$|Abundance Eco-Village is {{designed}} as an <b>off-grid,</b> and fully self-supporting development. In March 2008, the development had five family dwellings; in early 2012, there were 14 homes built in three clusters. Eco-Village has {{plans for a}} total of 30 homes. In addition to relying on solar and wind for electricity, the development collects its own rainwater and grows organic food in common areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{supply is}} {{dominated}} by thermal generation (65%), while hydropower (35%) has a smaller share in its generation mix compared to other South American countries. (Latin America and the Caribbean, or LAC, average hydropower capacity is 51%.) In 2014, national electricity supply of 1580,35 MW comfortably exceeded the 1298,2 MW maximum demand. Like in other countries, Bolivia’s electricity sector consists of a National Interconnected System (SIN) and <b>off-grid</b> systems (known as the Aislado).|$|E
25|$|Interest in {{renewable}} energies {{has increased in}} recent years due to environmental concern about global warming and air pollution, reduced costs of the technologies themselves, and improved efficiency and reliability. In recent years, supportive programs from governments, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and community cooperatives have expanded access to these <b>off-grid</b> technologies and the energy services they provide. Program planners should select “low-hanging fruit” first, aiming for maximum access to modern energy services with the least effort.|$|E
25|$|For example, Zara Solar, an E+Co {{portfolio}} {{company in}} Tanzania, sells solar photovoltaic systems to <b>off-grid</b> households. These systems substantially reduce users’ reliance on highly polluting methods of energy like wood, kerosene and diesel generators. This has positive environmental benefits including reductions in deforestation, {{air pollution and}} carbon emissions. In addition, reduced ongoing fuel costs and improved indoor air and light quality bring positive social benefits including better respiratory health, financial stability and increased time for work and study at home.|$|E
25|$|Solar cells produce {{direct current}} {{electricity}} from sunlight {{which can be}} used to power equipment or to recharge a battery. The first practical application of photovoltaics was to power orbiting satellites and other spacecraft, but today the majority of photovoltaic modules are used for grid connected power generation. In this case an inverter is required to convert the DC to AC. There is a smaller market for <b>off-grid</b> power for remote dwellings, boats, recreational vehicles, electric cars, roadside emergency telephones, remote sensing, and cathodic protection of pipelines.|$|E
25|$|On 27 April 2008, Khan {{established}} a technical {{college in the}} Mianwali District called Namal College. It was built by the Mianwali Development Trust (MDT), and is an associate college of the University of Bradford in December 2005. Imran Khan Foundation is another welfare work, which aims to assist needy people all over Pakistan. It has provided help to flood victims in Pakistan. Buksh Foundation has partnered with the Imran Khan Foundation to light up villages in Dera Ghazi Khan, Mianwali and Dera Ismail Khan under the project 'Lighting a Million Lives'. The campaign will establish several Solar Charging Stations in the selected <b>off-grid</b> villages and will provide villagers with solar lanterns, which can be regularly charged at the solar-charging stations.|$|E
25|$|Small wind {{turbines}} {{may be used}} for a variety of applications including on- or <b>off-grid</b> residences, telecom towers, offshore platforms, rural schools and clinics, remote monitoring and other purposes that require energy where there is no electric grid, or where the grid is unstable. Small {{wind turbines}} may be as small as a fifty-watt generator for boat or caravan use. Hybrid solar and wind powered units are increasingly being used for traffic signage, particularly in rural locations, as they avoid the need to lay long cables from the nearest mains connection point. The U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) defines small wind turbines as those smaller than or equal to 100 kilowatts. Small units often have direct drive generators, direct current output, aeroelastic blades, lifetime bearings and use a vane to point into the wind.|$|E
25|$|Developing {{countries}} where many villages {{are often more}} than five kilometers away from grid power are increasingly using photovoltaics. In remote locations in India a rural lighting program has been providing solar powered LED lighting to replace kerosene lamps. The solar powered lamps were sold at {{about the cost of}} a few months' supply of kerosene. Cuba is working to provide solar power for areas that are off grid. More complex applications of <b>off-grid</b> solar energy use include 3D printers. RepRap 3D printers have been solar powered with photovoltaic technology, which enables distributed manufacturing for sustainable development. These are areas where the social costs and benefits offer an excellent case for going solar, though the lack of profitability has relegated such endeavors to humanitarian efforts. However, in 1995 solar rural electrification projects had been found to be difficult to sustain due to unfavorable economics, lack of technical support, and a legacy of ulterior motives of north-to-south technology transfer.|$|E
25|$|Power {{engineering}} {{deals with}} the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity {{as well as the}} design of a range of related devices. These include transformers, electric generators, electric motors, high voltage engineering, and power electronics. In many regions of the world, governments maintain an electrical network called a power grid that connects a variety of generators together with users of their energy. Users purchase electrical energy from the grid, avoiding the costly exercise of having to generate their own. Power engineers may work on the design and maintenance of the power grid as well as the power systems that connect to it. Such systems are called on-grid power systems and may supply the grid with additional power, draw power from the grid, or do both. Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid, called <b>off-grid</b> power systems, which in some cases are preferable to on-grid systems. The future includes Satellite controlled power systems, with feedback in real time to prevent power surges and prevent blackouts.|$|E
500|$|Photovoltaics were {{initially}} solely {{used as a}} source of electricity for small and medium-sized applications, from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an <b>off-grid</b> rooftop PV system. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. [...] The 392MW Ivanpah installation is the largest concentrating solar power plant in the world, located in the Mojave Desert of California.|$|E
500|$|Renewable {{energy is}} also the most {{economic}} solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources. As the cost of renewable power falls, the scope of economically viable applications increases. Renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity. Where [...] "oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source (e.g. on islands, <b>off-grid</b> and in some countries) a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today". As of 2012, renewable power generation technologies accounted for around half of all new power generation capacity additions globally. In 2011, additions included 41 gigawatt (GW) of new wind power capacity, 30 GW of PV, 25 GW of hydro-electricity, 6 GW of biomass, 0.5 GW of CSP, and 0.1 GW of geothermal power.|$|E
