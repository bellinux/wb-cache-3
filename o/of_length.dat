40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the system <b>of</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> non-finitely {{generated}} atomic Puiseux monoids (a Puiseux monoid is an additive submonoid of Q_> 0). We begin by presenting a BF-monoid M with full system <b>of</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>lengths,</b> {{which means that}} for each subset S of Z_> 2 there exists an element x ∈ M whose set <b>of</b> <b>lengths</b> L(x) is S. It {{is well known that}} systems <b>of</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>lengths</b> do not characterize numerical monoids. Here, we prove that systems <b>of</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>lengths</b> do not characterize non-finitely generated atomic Puiseux monoids. In a recent paper, Geroldinger and Schmid found the intersection of systems <b>of</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> numerical monoids. Motivated by this, we extend their result to the setting of atomic Puiseux monoids. Finally, we relate the sets <b>of</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> the Puiseux monoid P = 〈 1 /p | p is prime〉 with the Goldbach's conjecture; in particular, we show that L(2) is precisely the set of Goldbach's numbers.

40|$|Transfer Krull monoids are monoids {{which allow}} a weak {{transfer}} homomorphism to a commutative Krull monoid, {{and hence the}} system <b>of</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> a transfer Krull monoid coincides {{with that of the}} associated commutative Krull monoid. We unveil a couple of new features of the system <b>of</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> transfer Krull monoids over finite abelian groups G, and we provide a complete description of the system for all groups G having Davenport constant D(G) = 5 (these are the smallest groups for which no such descriptions were known so far). Under reasonable algebraic finiteness assumptions, sets <b>of</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> transfer Krull monoids and of weakly Krull monoids satisfy the Structure Theorem for Sets <b>of</b> <b>Lengths.</b> In spite <b>of</b> this common feature we demonstrate that systems <b>of</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>lengths</b> for a variety of classes of weakly Krull monoids are different from the system <b>of</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> any transfer Krull monoid...|$|R
5|$|Attempts {{to resolve}} the {{electrical}} units in terms <b>of</b> <b>length,</b> mass, and time using dimensional analysis was beset with difficulties—the dimensions depended on whether one used the ESU or EMU systems. This anomaly was resolved in 1900 when Giovanni Giorgi published a paper in which he advocated using a fourth base unit alongside the existing three base units. The fourth unit could be chosen to be electric current, voltage, or electrical resistance.|$|E
5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position {{can be summarized}} as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be measured in terms <b>of</b> <b>length,</b> weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E
5|$|In 1670, Gabriel Mouton, a French abbot and astronomer, {{published}} the book Observationes diametrorum solis et lunae apparentium {{in which he}} proposed a decimal system of measurement <b>of</b> <b>length</b> for use by scientists in international communication, {{to be based on}} the dimensions of the Earth. The milliare would be defined as a minute of arc along a meridian and would be divided into 10 centuria, the centuria into 10 decuria and so on, successive units being the virga, virgula, decima, centesima, and the millesima. Mouton used Riccioli's estimate that one degree of arc was 321,185 Bolognese feet, and his own experiments showed that a pendulum <b>of</b> <b>length</b> one virgula would beat 3959.2 times in half an hour. Current pendulum theory shows that such a pendulum would have had an equivalent length of 205.6mm – using today's knowledge of the size of the earth, the virgula would have been approximately 185.2mm. He believed that with this information scientists in a foreign country would be able to construct a copy of the virgula for their own use.|$|E
