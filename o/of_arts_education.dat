Abstract: The {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} issue <b>of</b> creativity in <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> The theoretical {{part of the}} work first explains the general foundation of the social context, which {{plays a key role in}} education focused on the development of creativity. The author outlines the historical roots of the relationship between <b>art</b> <b>education</b> and creativity against the background of emerging interest in creativity in the subject of drawing in the Czechoslovak Republic in the 1920 s. Using key historical milestones in the field <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>education,</b> the work looks back at the period of "intense interest in <b>art</b> <b>education</b> and creativity" between the 1960 s and 1980 s in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. On the basis of an evaluation <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> experts, the theoretical {{part of the work}} highlights the perceived problems that arose in the implementation of creativity training as part <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> The selected aspects of the self-evaluation conducted by schools on creativity in <b>art</b> <b>education</b> and reflections on the cross-cultural contexts of creativity chart contemporary issues in the given subject. Special attention is devoted to a definition of the term "creativity" [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the field}} <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> has, in recent years, {{acknowledged}} {{the prevalence of}} non-formal educational sites, our literature is divided on whether this trend poses an opportunity for cooperation and strength or {{a threat to the}} status <b>of</b> <b>art</b> as a school subject. This paper consults the literature of critical theory within the domains <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> <b>education,</b> and leisure studies in order {{to examine the relationship between}} formal and non-formal <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> First, it considers ways in which tradition conceptualizations <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> <b>education,</b> leisure, and work foster an acceptance <b>of</b> <b>art</b> as experience and knowledge to be gained outside of school. Second, it explores the notions of lifelong learning and education, which are frequently offered as umbrellas under which school and community-based <b>art</b> <b>education</b> can peacefully co-exist. The paper suggests that neither an uncritical call for cooperation nor a more entrenched territoriality between formal and non-formal institutions is likely to serve the future interests <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> Rather, a complex problem is revealed which requires a reconceptualization of education, a consideration of values surrounding democratic access to knowledge, and a challenge to work toward more egalitarian institutional and social structures...|$|R
