This paper considers using multivariate and data envelopment analyses to facilitate the energy management of chiller systems. The system studied contains five sets of chillers, pumps and cooling waters and it operates for an institutional building.

The resulting materials {{are composed of}} completely accessible metallic crystallites with a diameter of about 3 nm, located inside silica particles exhibiting a monodisperse microporous distribution centered on a pore width of about 0. 8 nm. Voids between silica particles and between aggregates of silica particles constitute the material meso- and macroporous texture. The EDAS/TEOS ratio is the main <b>operating</b> <b>variable</b> to tailor the material morphology. When the EDAS/TEOS ratio decreases, metallic particle size decreases, whereas silica particle size increases. Thus the meso- and macropores between silica particles are larger.
