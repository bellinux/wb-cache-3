50|$|<b>Orciprenaline</b> (INN), {{also known}} as metaproterenol (USAN), is a {{bronchodilator}} used {{in the treatment of}} asthma. <b>Orciprenaline</b> is a moderately selective β2 adrenergic receptor agonist that stimulates receptors of the smooth muscle in the lungs, uterus, and vasculature supplying skeletal muscle, with minimal or no effect on α adrenergic receptors. The pharmacologic effects of β adrenergic agonist drugs, such as <b>orciprenaline,</b> are at least in part attributable to stimulation through β adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenylyl cyclase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP. Increased cAMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from many cells, especially from mast cells.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 1980s isoetharine was largely {{replaced}} {{in the marketplace}} by <b>orciprenaline</b> (metaproterenol), which seemed to have slightly less cardiac side effect and lasted {{a couple of hours}} longer. <b>Orciprenaline</b> in turn was replaced by salbutamol (albuterol). Some practitioners still believe that these later aerosolized bronchodilators never gave quite as quick of relief from asthmatic shortness of breath as did isoetarine. Thus they see a continued specialty role in treatment of severe shortness of breath that does not improve in the first five minutes of salbutamol treatment.|$|E
50|$|In 1967, it {{was shown}} that the β2-receptor was {{responsible}} for bronchodilation and this led to development of more selective drugs. In 1961 <b>orciprenaline,</b> a longer acting β2-agonist was found, {{but it was not}} as potent as isoproterenol. <b>Orciprenaline</b> does not have the catechol structure which was the reason for the longer action time. In the mid-1960s, albuterol or salbutamol was discovered, followed by terbutalin and fenoterol a few years later. Albuterol and terbutaline gave fewer side effects, such as increased heart rate, than isoproterenol. The pharmaceutical company Glaxo discovered salmeterol, a long-acting β2-agonist that had bronchodilation activity for up to 12 hours. It was marketed in 1990. Formoterol, another long-acting β2-agonist, was marketed shortly after. This long duration of action made the treatment for severe asthma and COPD more convenient for the patients because it is inhaled twice a day.In 2013 an extra long-acting β2-agonist, vilanterol, was marketed. Its duration of action lasts for 24 hours which should improve patients' compliance and make the treatment more convenient.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{drugs have}} been used as {{supportive}} therapeutic intervention such as lidocaine, naloxone, thiamine, lorazepam, vecuronium, etomidate, propofol, tolazoline, yohimbine, atropine, naloxone, <b>orciprenaline,</b> metoclopramide, ranitidine, metoprolol, enoxaparin, flucloxacillin, insulin, and irrigation of both eyes with saline. Effects of xylazine are also reversed by the analeptics 4-aminopyridine, doxapram, and caffeine, which are physiological antagonists to central nervous system depressants. Combining yohimbine and 4-aminopyridine in an effort to antagonize xylazine is superior as compared to the administration of either of these drugs individually due to reduction of recovery time. Research initiatives may be necessary in order to standardize treatment and determine effective measures for identifying chronic xylazine usage and intoxication.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to answer the {{question}} of whether stimulation after administration of catecholamines is mandatory for identifying unsuccessful ablations of atrioventricular node re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT). BackgroundThe success of radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation in AVNRT is confirmed in many centers by noninducibility of tachycardias during stimulation after the administration of catecholamines. MethodsA total of 131 patients (81 women and 50 men; mean age 53. 6 ± 13. 7 years [range 20 to 77]) were studied. Electrical stimulation was performed without and with the beta-adrenergic amine <b>Orciprenaline</b> (metaproterenol) before and after RF catheter ablation. ResultsIn 100 patients (76. 3 %; confidence interval [CI] 68. 1 % to 83. 3 %) an AVNRT was inducible without administration of <b>Orciprenaline.</b> Thirty minutes after the initially successful ablation in 95 patients, tachycardia was inducible in none of these patients, not even after <b>Orciprenaline</b> administration. In the 31 patients (23. 7 %; CI 16. 7 % to 31. 9 %) in whom there was no tachycardia inducible before ablation, <b>Orciprenaline</b> was given, and the stimulation protocol was repeated. In only five patients (3. 8 %; CI 1. 3 % to 8. 7 %) was there still no tachycardia inducible. After an initially successful ablation in the 26 patients who had inducible tachycardias with <b>Orciprenaline</b> before ablation, no tachycardia could be re-induced. After <b>Orciprenaline,</b> the tachycardia was inducible again in only one patient. ConclusionsOnly patients who require catecholamines for tachycardia induction before ablation need catecholamines for control of the success of the ablation of AVNRT...|$|E

40|$|The {{positive}} inotropic {{responses of}} guinea-pig left atria and papillary muscles and positive chronotropic responses of right atria to sympathomimetic amines were examined at 38 degrees and 30 degrees C. At the lower temperature, supersensitivity to <b>orciprenaline</b> and isoprenaline was exhibited as shifts of the dose-response curves {{to the left}} and significant reductions in EC 50 values. This supersensitivity could not be attributed to reduced metabolism since the experiments were performed in the presence of metanephrine (10 (- 5) M) and U- 0521 (3 ', 4 '-dihydroxy- 2 -methylpropiophenone) (10 (- 4) M) as inhibitors of extraneuronal uptake and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) respectively, and the agonists are not susceptible to neuronal uptake. After incubation of the tissues with Ro 03 - 7894 (1 -(5 -chloracetylaminobenzfuran- 2 -yl) - 2 -isopropylaminoethanol), followed by its prolonged washout (greater than 2 h), the maximum responses to isoprenaline and <b>orciprenaline</b> were depressed, confirming the apparently irreversible beta-adrenoceptor antagonism. Dissociation constants (KA) for isoprenaline and <b>orciprenaline</b> were determined from the equiactive concentrations obtained before (A) and after (A') incubation with Ro 03 - 7894, plotted as 1 /A against 1 /A' (KA = (slope- 1) /intercept). KA values were the same for <b>orciprenaline</b> in the three cardiac preparations and for isoprenaline in the atria. This applied at 38 degrees and 30 degrees C and indicates that the beta-adrenoceptors mediating the inotropic and chronotropic responses of the guinea-pig heart do not differ. The KA values of both agonists were, however, consistently and significantly lower at 30 degrees than at 38 degrees C, indicating an increase in affinity. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists and the activity of carbonic anhydrase I and II in erythrocyte, clinical and vessel studies. Kinetic studies were performed. Adrenergic agonists increased erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase as follows: adrenaline by 75 %, noradrenaline by 68 %, isoprenaline by 55 %, and <b>orciprenaline</b> by 62 %. The kinetic data indicated a non-competitive mechanism of action. In clinical studies carbonic anhydrase I from erythrocytes increased by 87 % after noradrenaline administration, by 71 % after <b>orciprenaline</b> and by 82 % after isoprenaline. The increase in carbonic anhydrase I paralleled the increase in blood pressure. Similar results were obtained in vessel studies on piglet vascular smooth muscle. We believe that adrenergic agonists may have a dual mechanism of action: the first one consists of a catecholamine action on its receptor {{with the formation of}} a stimulus-receptor complex. The second mechanism proposed completes the first one. By this second component of the mechanism, the same stimulus directly acts on the carbonic anhydrase I isozyme (that might be functionally coupled with adrenergic receptors), so that its activation ensures an adequate pH for stimulus-receptor coupling for signal transduction into the cell, resulting in vasoconstriction...|$|E

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} to sympathomimetic amines of isolated atria removed from sham-injected and 6 -hydroxydopamine-treated (6 -OHDA) guinea-pigs was {{examined in the}} presence of an extraneuronal uptake blocker and an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist. Three weeks of pretreatment with 6 -OHDA resulted in leftwards shifts of the dose-response curves for the positive chronotropic and inotropic responses of right and left atria to isoprenaline. The responses to the partial agonist salbutamol were also potentiated after 6 -OHDA pretreatment, revealed as an increase in the maximum response relative to isoprenaline. The supersensitivity was post-synaptic in origin and independent of changes in disposition or metabolism, since it was observed with agonists immune to neuronal uptake and O-methylation, and {{in the presence of}} extraneuronal uptake inhibition by metanephrine. It was also specific for the beta-adrenoceptor, no super{{sensitivity to}} histamine being found. In the right atria, the supersensitivity was partially masked by an opposing depressant effect after 6 -OHDA pretreatment which was observed with histamine.

Atria from 6 -OHDA-pretreated animals were supersensitive to <b>orciprenaline,</b> but the KA value did not differ from that after sham injection.

The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the effect of esmolol on cerebral blood flow, cerebral vasoreactivity, and cognitive performance. Ten healthy volunteers were investigated in two separate experimental sessions using functional magnetic resonance imaging. During the first experimental session, a hyperventilation task and a cognitive task, subjects had to perform both tasks twice, once after administration of an esmolol bolus of 1 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 150 microg. kg. min and once without beta-blockade, in a random order. During the second experimental session subjects were scanned at resting state after administration of esmolol.

40|$|The acute {{influence}} of NO 2 on mechanics of breathing and respiratory gas exchange {{was investigated in}} a total of 111 subjects, aged 25 to 74 years, with chronic nonspecific lung disease (CNSLD). They breathed NO 2 -air mixtures containing 0. 5 to 8. 0 ppm NO 2 for up to 15 to 60 min. Additionally in nine subjects the protective action of atropine, meclastine, and <b>orciprenaline</b> was investigated. While the alveolar P 02 remained nearly constant during inhalation of 5 and 4 ppm NO 2, a significant decrease of the arterial P 02 and a corresponding increase of the arterial to alveolar P 02 gradients occurred. Inhalation of 2 ppm NO 2 had not such an effect. Inhalation of NO 2 at concentrations down to 1. 5 ppm resulted in a significant increase of airway resistance. Lower concentrations had no significant effect. Prolongation of the exposure period from 15 to 60 min at a NO 2 concentration of 5 ppm did not result in a more pronounced disturbance of the respiratory gas exchange for oxygen beyond the extent observed after exposure to 5 ppm NO 2 for 15 min. Meclastine, in comparison with <b>orciprenaline</b> and atropine, showed a pronounced protective effect on the negative impact of NO 2 on respiratory gas exchange and airway resistance. It is concluded that NO 2 may act by release of histamine, causing a bronchiolar, alveolar, and interstitial edema, thus differing from irritant air pollutants like SO 2, where reflex bronchoconstriction causes in some bronchitics dramatic increases of airway resistance at similar low concentrations...|$|E

40|$|Terbutaline in {{children}} with asthma. A double-blind, single-dose trial was carried out on 30 asthmatic children to study the effect of oral terbutaline in two different concentrations and of a placebo on ventilatory function and pulse rate. The higher dose of terbutaline (0 075 mg/kg) gave a satisfactory and prolonged action on ventilation without cardiovascular side effects. Sympathomimetic amines have an established place {{in the treatment of}} bronchial asthma. Since the introduction of isoprenaline, a search has been undertaken for compounds with a more prolonged broncholytic action combined with fewer cardio-vascular side effects. <b>Orciprenaline</b> was a success-ful result of this search (Engelhardt, Hoefke, and Wick, 1961). Lands, Groblewski, and Brown showed in 1966, and Lands et al. in 1967, that there were two distinct receptors of the 3 -adrenergic type; the optimal structural requirements for cardiac stimu-lation were different from those for the advanta-geous broncholytic activity. After this differentia-tion, salbutamol was introduced, having more P 2 - and less [l-stimulating properties than pre-viously known catecholamines (Hartley et al., 1968; Brittain et al., 1968), and about the same time terbutaline was investigated by Bergman, Persson, and Wetterlin (1969). Terbutaline differs chemically from <b>orciprenaline</b> in that the N-isopropyl group is replaced by an N-tertiary butyl group. This change makes dealkylation more difficult and enhances the, 8 -receptor stimulating properties of terbutaline. Animal experiments have shown that terbutaline acts selectively on bronchial muscle, with little or no effect on cardiac musculature (Persson and Olsson, 1970). Clinical trials in adults (Arner, 1970; Formgren, 1970 a, b; Freedman, 1971) have confirmed the pronouncedand long-lasting broncho-lytic activity and the negligible cardiovascular side effects.

40|$|The {{measurement}} {{of response to}} bronchodilators by recording the change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (F. E.

In 18 patients given isoprenaline, the time of peak response varied, but a 30 -minute testing time gave the closest approximation to peak response. In order to test whether repeated doses would increase the response, inhalations of isoprenaline were given at 30 -minute intervals, the F. E. V. 1 · 0 being measured after each dose. There was a further response after successive doses until a plateau was reached, usually after the third dose. The maximum response obtained was often considerably greater than the response after the first administration of isoprenaline, the average increase in F. E.

Four patients were given repeated inhalations of isoprenaline until the response reached a plateau, and then 250 mg. of aminophylline was injected intravenously. None of these patients showed any further improvement with aminophylline. The significance of these findings is discussed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development and}} utilisation of techniques for characterisation and transdermal delivery of various systems for pharmaceutical applications. The degree of dissociation of drug molecules and the mobilities of the different species formed are essential factors affecting the rate of drug delivery by iontophoresis. Hence, determination of drug mobility parameters and equilibrium constants are important {{for the development of}} iontophoretic systems. With capillary zone electrophoresis using a partial filling technique and methyl-β-cyclodextrin as chiral selector, the enantiomers of <b>orciprenaline</b> were separated. The association constants between the enantiomers of the drug and the selector were also evaluated. Precision conductometry studies were performed for the hydrochloride salts of lidocaine and 5 -aminolevulinic acid in aqueous propylene glycol and water as media, respectively. Iontophoresis is a technique for drug delivery where charged molecules are transported into and through skin by application of a weak direct electrical current. The drugs 5 -aminolevulinic acid and its methyl ester were used as model compounds and incorporated in two different drug delivery vehicles, a sponge phase and carbopol gel. The bicontinuous structure of the sponge phase, constituted of monoolein and a mixture of propylene glycol and water, makes it interesting for use in iontophoretic delivery, since ions can move more or less freely in the aqueous {{as well as in the}} lipid domains. Furthermore, all three components are known for their penetration enhancing abilities. Hydrogels like carbopol gels are interesting media with respect to iontophoretic studies, since devices for iontophoresis often utilize hydrogels as contact interfaces between the skin and the electrodes. The results indicate that the transport achieved iontophoretically using the gel (1 % active substance) was comparable with the passive delivery of clinically used formulations (16 % - 20 % active substance) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Diff erent reentry {{circuits}} within A-V node {{region are}} able to sustain A-V nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). On this basis, electrophysiological criteria {{for at least three}} AVNRT types – slow/fast, fast/slow, and slow/ slow–have been proposed. Th e aim was to reevaluate these criteria in a group of our patients. In addition, clinical profi le and long-term success rate of catheter ablation procedure were studied. Methods: All consecutive patients referred for catheter ablation of AVNRT from September 2004 to December 2006 were prospectively recruited. Th e informed consent was signed by all and the study had been approved by the competent state’s ethics committee. A standard electrophysiological study with programmed single or double extrastimuli or high-rate electrostimulation until the development of refractoriness or tachycardia induction was performed. <b>Orciprenaline</b> i. v. was used to facilitate AVNRT induction and to test the ablation result. Slow-pathway electrograms at inferoposteroseptal right atrium and ablation-induced nodal rhythm were ablation targets. Th e radiofrequency energy of 30 – 50 W for a duration of at least 20 seconds was used. Non-inducibility of AVNRT and of echo-beats was the procedure end point. In addition, antegrade and retrograde A-V junction conduction times were measured and analysed manually. Patients underwent a detailed re-evaluation aft er at least 1 year of follow-up. Th e descriptive statistic was used to present the data. Results: One hundred and four patients, 72 % female, mean age 53 years, were included. Th ey had their fi rst tachycardia episode at a mean age of 35 years with an average recurrence rate of 1 - to 3 -times a year. Syncope was experienced in 9. 5 % of patients. Familial tachycardias were reported in 4 % of patients. One third (34 %) were hypertensive (≥ 140 / 90 mmHg). In majority, slow/fast AVNRT type (98 / 104 – 94 %) was induced. Th e fast/slow and slow/slow types were rare (3 / 104 each). Th e mean heart rate of induced AVNRT was 166 beats/min. Measurements were available for 92 patients. Our best diagnostic criteria were: V-A’interval ( 150 fast/slow, 70 – 120 slow/slow), H-A’interval (200 fast/slow; 120 – 170 slow/ slow), and A’-H/H-A’ ratio (> 2, 3 slow/fast, < 1 fast/slow, 1 – 2, 3 slow/slow). Th e slow/fast type was generally induced from the atrium, while the fast/slow and slow/slow also from the ventricle. In the slow/fast type, the earliest retrograde atrial activation was recorded from the His bundle position in 95 % (proximal coronary sinus (CS) in 5 %). Th e earliest retrograde atrial activation was recorded from proximal CS in the fast/slow type, but from CS or His in the slow/slow. A transient A-V block was documented in 6 patients during ablation procedure. None of them needed a permanent pacemaker implantation. Aft er 16 months of follow-up, 96 % of our patients were free of tachycardia recurrences. Conclusions: Electophysiologic criteria for three AVNRT types, clinical characteristics, and AVNRT long-term radiofrequency catheter ablation success rate are consistent with data reported in the literature...|$|E
