In 1982, Applewhite and Nettles allowed their disciples to call their families. They further relaxed their control in 1983, permitting their followers to visit relatives on Mother's Day. They were only allowed short stays and were instructed to tell their families that they were studying computers at a monastery.

Fairley had some Shiga anti-toxin with him, but it proved ineffective in serious cases, even when administered in large doses.

The drug was administered to a patient with severe shigellosis who was not expected to live, and the patient soon recovered.

5|$|Melkhior the wizard's castle {{consists}} {{of a series of}} 128 rooms, each displayed on a single, non-scrolling screen. Sabreman must navigate the 3D maze of stone blocks in each room, usually to retrieve a collectible object, whilst avoiding spikes and enemies, which kill him on contact. The player begins with four lives, and loses one for each death; running out of lives ends the game. Stone blocks serve as platforms for the player to jump between; some fall under the player's weight, some move <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>accord,</b> and some can be pushed by ghosts. Sabreman jumps higher when in werewolf form, which helps in specific puzzles. The player often needs to move blocks to reach distant objects, which are then used as platforms to reach areas in other puzzles. To complete the game, the player must return 14 sequential objects from throughout the castle to the wizard's cauldron room. At the end of the game, the player receives a final score based on the remaining time and amount of the quest completed.|$|E

5|$|For Operation Barbarossa, {{initially}} four Einsatzgruppen were created, each numbering 500–990 men {{to comprise}} a total force of 3,000. Einsatzgruppen A, B, and C {{were to be}} attached to Army Groups North, Centre, and South; Einsatzgruppe D {{was assigned to the}} 11th Army. The Einsatzgruppe for Special Purposes operated in eastern Poland starting in July 1941. The Einsatzgruppen were {{under the control of the}} RSHA, headed by Heydrich and later by his successor, SS-Obergruppenführer Ernst Kaltenbrunner. Heydrich gave them a mandate to secure the offices and papers of the Soviet state and Communist Party; to liquidate all the higher cadres of the Soviet state; and to instigate and encourage pogroms against Jewish populations. The men of the Einsatzgruppen were recruited from the SD, Gestapo, Kriminalpolizei (Kripo), Orpo, and Waffen-SS. Each Einsatzgruppe was under the operational control of the Higher SS Police Chiefs in its area of operations. In May 1941, General Wagner and SS-Brigadeführer Walter Schellenberg agreed that the Einsatzgruppen in front-line areas were to operate under army command, while the army provided the Einsatzgruppen with all necessary logistical support. Given their main task was defeating the enemy, the army left the pacification of the civilian population to the Einsatzgruppen, who offered support as well as prevented subversion.

25|$|Since a team {{almost always}} scores fewer {{runs in a}} {{baseball}} game than its number of outs, a baserunner will frequently take risks attempting to advance an extra base or to score a run, resulting in close plays at a base.

In general, cricket batsmen are run out due to exceptional fielding, poor judgment/communication, or a combination of said factors. In baseball, runners are often out not <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>accord</b> – they are simply forced out.|$|E

According to some other historians, a few Karnataka officials, who were subordinate to the Pala kings, had established their independent kingdom in the region of Radha, taking advantage of the weakness of the Pala powers.

50|$|The high {{poverty rate}} in Rome {{led to a}} need for public baths, or thermae since it was {{uncommon}} {{for the middle class}} citizens to <b>own</b> one <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>according</b> to journalist Jay Stuller. When the heated bath water was not chemically cleansed or filtered with chemicals such as chlorine, bacteria thrived and spread. When Christianity came to Rome, it saw the public nudity of the bathing system and saw it as debauchery and therefore frowned upon. While the bathing system may not have been pristine, abstaining from cleanliness altogether brought upon many more potentially fatal diseases, especially in infants. This trend started and ended in Rome. As the necessity for bathing became recognized, the protests of the Christian church died down and a new elaborate bathing system was designed under the rule of Emperor Augustus. Even an imperial-version sauna was created for cleansing the body of toxins.|$|R
