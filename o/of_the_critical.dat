40|$|Recent {{research}} in <b>the</b> domain <b>of</b> real-time scheduling theory has tackled <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> scheduling mixed-criticality systems upon uniprocessor or multiprocessor platforms, {{with the main}} objective being to respect <b>the</b> timeliness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most <b>critical</b> tasks, at <b>the</b> expense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> less <b>critical</b> ones. In particular, <b>the</b> less <b>critical</b> tasks are carelessly discarded when <b>the</b> computation demand <b>of</b> (some <b>of)</b> <b>the</b> high <b>critical</b> tasks increases. This might nevertheless result in system failure, as these less critical tasks could be accessing data, <b>the</b> consistency <b>of</b> which should be preserved. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a method to cautiously handle task suspension. Furthermore, it is usually assumed that <b>the</b> less <b>critical</b> tasks will never be re-enabled once discarded. In this paper, we also address this concern by proposing an approach to re-enable <b>the</b> less <b>critical</b> tasks, without jeopardizing <b>the</b> timeliness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high <b>critical</b> ones. <b>The</b> suggested approaches apply to systems having two or more criticality levels...|$|R
5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} and testing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> detonators was shared between Lauritsen's group at Caltech and Robert Henderson's group at Los Alamos. By mid-1945, the object was to produce 1,000 detonators each week. Meeting this target proved challenging. Reliability was the key problem, with initial batches containing unacceptably high numbers of failures. In May 1945, a box of detonators manufactured by Raytheon fell from a truck and tumbled down a mountain side, but were found to still be in working order.|$|E

5|$|Although some {{of these}} {{restrictions}} were later loosened or rescinded, Johnson (with McNamara's support) kept a tight rein on the campaign, which continuously infuriated the American military commanders, right-wing members of Congress, and even some within the administration itself. One of the primary objectives of the operation, {{at least to the}} military, should have been the closure of Haiphong and other ports by aerial mining, thereby slowing or halting the flow of seaborne supplies entering the north. President Johnson refused to take such a provocative action, however, and such an operation was not implemented until 1972. There was also little consultation between Johnson and the military chiefs during the target selection process. Even the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Earl G. Wheeler, was not present for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> discussions of 1965 and participated only occasionally thereafter.|$|E

These repeats were accompanied by a disclaimer that the GAIA organisation depicted in the programme was not connected with the Gaia publishing company supported by Prince Philip.

Starting 5 June, the Israeli engineers started to fix the road so that it let civil transport trucks pass to supply the city. 150 workers, working in four teams, installed a pipeline to supply the city with water, because the other pipeline, crossing Latrun, had been cut by the Jordanians. In O Jerusalem, Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins talked about heroic action, when during the night of 6–7 June, in fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> situation of Jerusalem and to improve {{the morale of the}} population, 300 inhabitants of Tel Aviv were requisitioned to carry on their backs, for the few kilometers not yet ready for the trucks, what would be needed to feed {{the inhabitants of}} Jerusalem one more day.|$|E

In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material.

Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.|$|E
5|$|Realising the {{symbolic}} {{significance of the}} dam to the Portuguese, FRELIMO proceeded to spend seven years attempting to halt its construction by force. No direct attacks were ever successful, but FRELIMO had some success in attacking convoys {{en route to the}} site. FRELIMO also lodged a protest with the United Nations about the project, and their cause was aided by negative reports of Portuguese actions in Mozambique. In spite of the subsequent withdrawal of much foreign financial support for the dam, it was finally completed in December 1974. The dam's intended propaganda value to the Portuguese was overshadowed by the adverse Mozambican public reaction to the extensive dispersal of the indigenous populace, who were forced to relocate from their homes to allow for the construction project. The dam also deprived farmers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> annual floods, which formerly re-fertilised the plantations.|$|E

5|$|The {{isotopes}} neptunium-235, -236, and -237 are {{predicted to}} be fissile; only neptunium-237's fissionability has been experimentally shown, with the critical mass being about 60kg, only about 10kg {{more than that}} of the commonly used uranium-235. Calculated values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> masses of neptunium-235, -236, and -237 respectively are 66.2kg, 6.79kg, and 63.6kg: the neptunium-236 value is even lower than that of plutonium-239. In particular 236Np also has a low neutron cross section. Despite this, a neptunium atomic bomb has never been built: uranium and plutonium have lower critical masses than 235Np and 237Np, and 236Np is difficult to purify as it is not found in quantity in spent nuclear fuel and is nearly impossible to separate in any significant quantities from its parent 237Np.|$|E
