The severe damage to Resolution caused Operation Menace to be abandoned and Barham had to tow her to Freetown for temporary repairs, before escorting a convoy to Gibraltar where she arrived on 15 October where her <b>own</b> <b>damage</b> was repaired.

Immediately prior to this, Ray {{had been forced to}} dive under Kumano in order to escape aerial and surface attack, and would subsequently ground in shoal water, shearing off her starboard sound head and blowing the sound head cable back into the torpedo room. To prevent further flooding, the submarine came to periscope depth where she saw the bowless cruiser being towed away by a transport. Her <b>own</b> <b>damage</b> and the Japanese escorts kept Ray from following up the attack. Kumano was destroyed off Luzon by Navy carrier planes 25 November.|$|E

50|$|Historically, only {{parents could}} sue for their <b>own</b> <b>damages</b> {{incurred}} {{as a result}} of the birth of a disabled child (e.g., the mother's own pregnancy medical bills and cost of psychiatric treatment for both parents' emotional distress resulting from the realization that their child was disabled). This cause of action is known as wrongful birth. But the child could not sue for his or her <b>own</b> <b>damages,</b> which were often much more substantial, in terms of the cost of round-the-clock personal care and special education.|$|R

60|$|The idea {{on which}} this mode of {{treatment}} is founded--namely, {{that it is a}} matter of course that children should do right, so that when they do right there is nothing to be said, and that doing wrong is the abnormal condition and exceptional action which alone requires the parent to interfere--is, to a great extent, a mistake. Indeed, the matter of course is all the other way. A babe will seize the plaything of another babe without the least compunction long after it is keenly alive to the injustice and wrongfulness of having its own playthings taken by any other child. So in regard to truth. The first impulse of all children, when they have just acquired the use of language, is to use it in such a way as to effect their object for the time being, without any sense of the sacred obligation of making the words always correspond truly with the facts. The principles of doing justice to the rights of others to one's <b>own</b> <b>damage,</b> and of speaking the truth when falsehood would serve the present purpose better, are principles that are developed or acquired by slow degrees, and at a later period. I say developed or acquired--for different classes of metaphysicians and theologians entertain different theories in respect to the way by which the ideas of right and of duty enter into the human mind. But all will agree in this, that whatever may be the origin of the moral sense in man, it does not appear as a practical element of control for the conduct till some time after the animal appetites and passions have begun to exercise their power. Whether we regard this sense as arising from a development within of a latent principle of the soul, or as an essential element of the inherited and native constitution of man, though remaining for a time embryonic and inert, or as a habit acquired under the influence of instruction and example, all will admit that the period of its appearance as a perceptible motive of action is so delayed, and the time required for its attaining sufficient strength to exercise any real and effectual control over the conduct extends over so many of the earlier years of life, that no very material help in governing the appetites and passions and impulses can be reasonably expected from it at a very early period. Indeed, conscience, so far as its existence is manifested at all in childhood, seems to show itself chiefly in the form of the simple fear of detection in what there is reason to suppose will lead, if discovered, to reproaches or punishment.|$|E

5000|$|Critics {{today have}} hailed {{the film as}} a masterpiece.

5000|$|The game {{is played}} in a {{simplified}} logic of the older games: each unit [...] "life" [...] is measured by hit points and can only move {{a certain number of}} squares depending on their action points.

Each weapon also has its <b>own</b> <b>damage</b> rating and range.|$|E
50|$|To {{determine}} {{damage from}} an attack, {{the body is}} divided into 26 areas, each with its <b>own</b> <b>damage</b> points, and separate tables for determining damage to each area. Damage is further divided based {{on the type of}} weapon used, and the type of damage it could cause (blunt, crushing, burning, edged, etc.); then modified based on armor worn, again divided based on how the armor countered different damage types. Still more tables are used to find continuing damage from bleeding, recovery times, unconsciousness, temporary and permanent disabilities, or possibly death.|$|E
50|$|With the Leyte {{invasion}} now underway, TG 38.4, with Mugford, sped to {{meet the}} threat posed by major Japanese fleet movements, and on 24 October, planes from the force hit the Japanese center force in the Mindanao Sea, then headed north on receiving reports of a Japanese carrier force off northern Luzon. The next day strikes were flown against the Japanese, opening the battle off Cape Engano phase of an American victory, the battle for Leyte Gulf. Further action came 30 October, when a Japanese airstrike damaged Enterprise (CV-6), Belleau Wood (CVL-24), and Franklin (CV-13). Mugford and other destroyers guarded the damaged ships to safety at Ulithi, repaired their <b>own</b> <b>damage,</b> and returned to patrol duty in Leyte Gulf.|$|E

5000|$|The game uses turn-based strategy, {{as players}} choose a move from their wrestler's arsenal as their {{opponent}} does the same, {{and depending on}} the situation, one move will successfully be done. Each wrestler has five [...] "basic" [...] moves (which cause two damage points), four [...] "major" [...] moves (which cause four damage points), and one [...] "super" [...] move (which causes six damage points {{and is the only}} way to attempt to pin the opponent). Each wrestler also has a block option, which if done successfully will remove two of their <b>own</b> <b>damage</b> points. In addition, face wrestlers can attempt a special move in which they rally the crowd to gain momentum and recover some of their damage. Heel wrestlers can attempt special cheating tactics, but this runs the risk of disqualification.|$|E

Battle backgrounds were re-introduced, and are separated into top and bottom halves. Spells, skills, and items can all now have their <b>own</b> <b>damage</b> and recovery formulas, although a quick calculation method reminiscent of the older RPG Makers is available. The VX RTP was redesigned for VX Ace, and a new soundtrack featuring higher quality techno-pop tracks was included.

50|$|During {{the night}} of 12 September, Africaine outran her compatriots and {{attacked}} both French ships in the darkness. On the second broadside from AstrÃ©e, Corbet's right foot was shot off, the captain collapsing to the deck and being taken below. Although their captain had gone, the crew continued to fight and AstrÃ©e hauled off to allow IphigÃ©nie to attack. Two hours later, Africaine surrendered, her casualties mounting and the ship in a battered state. The French took possession but later abandoned the ship when Boadicea arrived. By the time British officers had resumed control of the ship, Corbet was dead. Almost immediately rumours spread that his death had not simply {{been the result of}} his wound: Stories were repeated in reputable histories that Corbet had been either murdered by his crew, or committed suicide to avoid the shame of defeat. Although the truth is unknown, Corbet's crew had displayed an unwillingness to enter action with him in command and once he was dead expressed a desire to pursue the French ships despite their <b>own</b> <b>damage</b> and casualties.|$|E
