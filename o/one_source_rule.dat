40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges facing gravitational wave astronomy in the low frequency band is the confusion noise generated by the vast numbers of unresolved galactic and extra galactic binary systems. Estimates of the binary confusion noise suffer from several sources of astrophysical uncertainty, such as the form of the initial mass function and the star formation rate. There is also considerable uncertainty about what defines the confusion limit. Various ad-hoc rules have been proposed, such as the <b>one</b> <b>source</b> per bin <b>rule,</b> and the <b>one</b> <b>source</b> per three bin rule. Here information theoretic methods are used to derive a more realistic estimate for the confusion limit. It is found that the gravitational wave background becomes unresolvable when there is, on average, more than <b>one</b> <b>source</b> per eight frequency bins. This raises the best estimate for the frequency at which galactic binaries become a source of noise from 1. 45 mHz to 2. 54 mHz. Comment: 4 pages, 1 Figur...|$|R

40|$|The <b>source</b> {{of income}} <b>rules</b> {{used in the}} United States and {{elsewhere}} in large part establish the contours of tax jurisdiction exercised by countries. The <b>source</b> <b>rules</b> {{play a vital role}} in the foreign tax credit system applicable to U. S. persons with foreign investment or business activities. The <b>source</b> <b>rules</b> also play a central role in the United States’ exercise of source taxation over foreign persons with U. S. businesses or investments. Other countries likewise use <b>source</b> <b>rules</b> or their equivalent in applying foreign tax credit or territorial systems to their residents and exercising source taxation over nonresidents. The current approach for sourcing income suffers from two related problems. First, the <b>source</b> <b>rules</b> lack coherence in that they fail to advance a consistent normative tax policy. More fundamentally, the rules fail to reflect the consistent application of the key principle appropriate for allocating nations’ primary taxing rights – namely, the benefits principle. The second problem is the variation in the <b>source</b> <b>rules</b> used worldwide. This may produce double taxation or non-taxation. This article addresses both of these problems by offering an approach for sourcing income that has the potential for being adopted by countries on a multilateral basis. The article develops an equity-based standard for sourcing that would allow for the derivation of <b>source</b> <b>rules</b> for various types of income. The core idea underlying the proposed sourcing standard is the benefits principle: income should be sourced to the country that provides the taxpayer with significant governmental benefits related to the income. Specifically, the article develops a standard that would devise <b>source</b> <b>rules</b> by evaluating the source of income on the basis of three factors: the destination of the services, property or capital giving rise to income; the location(s) of the activities giving rise to income; and the residence of the person receiving income. Based on this evaluation, the rule for a given type of income may divide the source of the income among multiple locations. By basing the <b>source</b> <b>rules</b> on an equity-based standard that allows source to be divided when appropriate, this article seeks to rationalize and harmonize the provisions used to source income for purposes of taxing cross-border investment and business activities...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} 2 ̆ 2 source 2 ̆ 2 {{is central to}} the {{functioning}} of the current international tax system. To the extent the 2 ̆ 2 source 2 ̆ 2 of income is meant to reflect the spatial location of income; however, many academic commentators have come to regard the concept as completely incoherent. Further, that incoherence is viewed as a partial explanation of the perceived artificiality and frailties of current instantiations of <b>source</b> <b>rules.</b> In this Paper I make three basic claims. First, it is in fact coherent to conceive of the source concept in terms of the spatial location of income. Second, most of the problems with current instantiations of <b>source</b> <b>rules</b> can be understood as reflections of fundamental complications in designing an income tax in a closed economy and thus {{have nothing to do with}} spatial indeterminacy. This observation allows for incremental improvement to <b>source</b> <b>rules</b> in the same fashion as one can make incremental improvement to a closed economy income tax. Third, from an efficiency perspective, a novel and ambitious way to approach <b>source</b> <b>rules</b> would be to use such rules to segregate rents from non-rents and mobile income from non-mobile income. Traditionally, scholars have viewed the efficiency characteristics of a rents-only tax as an affirmative argument for cashflow taxes over income taxes. Holding the existence of the income tax constant, however, <b>source</b> <b>rules</b> could theoretically achieve an efficient result on this dimension. The practical implementation hurdles, though, are substantial...|$|R
40|$|When {{the common}} law {{collateral}} <b>source</b> <b>rule</b> first arose {{in the area of}} tort law over one hundred years ago, only a minority of individuals maintained health insurance coverage to protect against loss in the event that a negligent actor injured them. Today, however, the vast majority of Americans are covered. Because of this change in the landscape of insurance coverage, many jurisdictions have abrogated or greatly eroded the collateral <b>source</b> <b>rule</b> under the belief that the rule no longer holds a justified role in personal injury litigation. Wisconsin, however, continues to follow {{the common law}} form of the rule and recently rejected legislation that would have effectively abrogated it. Wisconsin is not alone; many jurisdictions still adhere to the common law collateral <b>source</b> <b>rule,</b> and find support from many voices in the legal community. This support is grounded in the belief that the rationales that have long said to justify the rule still maintain their significance. This Comment agrees with them and argues that, while the collateral <b>source</b> <b>rule</b> may have its shortcomings, the many justifications for the common law form of the rule remain crucially valid today and are significantly overlooked by the suggested alternatives...|$|R
40|$|According to Posnerian law and economics, {{common law}} (i. e., judge-made law) tends to promote efficiency. Public choice teaches that {{statutory}} (legislated) law need {{have no such}} efficiency property because, unlike appointed judges, legislators are subject to short election cycles and are beholden to special interests for election and re-election. The collateral <b>source</b> <b>rule</b> is a common law norm that permits an injured party to recover damages from both the tortfeasor (injurer) and from private insurance. Published work in the law and economics literature indicates that despite an appearance that the rule permits unwarranted double recover, the rule is indeed generally efficient. Despite its efficiency properties, the rule has been modified by statute in many jurisdictions in recent decades. Insurers reap transitory gains if exceptions to the collateral <b>source</b> <b>rule</b> are granted by statute whereas medical care providers achieve an ongoing gain if their sector is specifically excluded from the rule's application. The authors report {{the results of their}} exhaustive survey of statutory law concerning the collateral <b>source</b> <b>rule</b> in the fifty states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands. The categorized findings reveal significant exceptions to the collateral <b>source</b> <b>rule</b> introduced into statutory law to the benefit of the special interests identified. forensic economics...|$|R

This application is set forth in Hayes v. Wieber Enterprises, Inc., where the plaintiff sued a restaurant for injuries she sustained from falling down the restaurant’s basement stairs. Why should the collateral <b>source</b> <b>rule</b> compel the defendant in Hayes to pay the original amount billed, $ 5, 800, when the physician accepted $ 3, 300 as payment in full? Is not $ 3, 300 the reasonable or {{market value of the}} medical services provided to the plaintiff?

40|$|In this Article, I {{relate the}} {{discomfort}} with fundamental principles in taxing individuals’ worldwide income {{to a problem}} that has attracted greater attention in recent years: the assignment of geographical sources to income.

Many scholars portray <b>source</b> and residence <b>rules</b> as inadequate means for achieving purportedly given normative objectives in the age of intense globalization and claim that we need better tools than these “meaningless” or “incoherent” concepts. Instead, I argue that the meaningfulness and coherence of the residence and source concepts are easily defended, and they are unsatisfactory mostly because the purported normative objectives of international taxation either do not stand scrutiny or attract little consensus. The intellectual perplexity of international income taxation pertains to ends, not means...|$|R
