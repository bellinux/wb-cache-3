5|$|Around {{this time}} Steinitz {{publicly}} spoke <b>of</b> <b>retiring,</b> but {{changed his mind}} when Emanuel Lasker, 32 years younger and comparatively untested at the top level, challenged him.

5|$|By {{the time}} of his match in 1890–91 against Gunsberg, some {{commentators}} showed an understanding of and appreciation for Steinitz's theories. Shortly before the 1894 match with Emanuel Lasker, even the New York Times, which had earlier published attacks on his play and character, paid tribute to his playing record, the importance of his theories, and his sportsmanship in agreeing to the most difficult match of his career despite his previous intention <b>of</b> <b>retiring.</b>|$|E
5|$|In spite <b>of</b> <b>retiring</b> {{from the}} military, Matsui {{hoped to get}} another job in China working with the Japanese-sponsored {{government}} there. Ultimately, he instead accepted the position of Cabinet Councillor, an advisory post, in June 1938. He continued to serve in this capacity until January 1940 when he resigned to protest Prime Minister Mitsumasa Yonai's opposition to an alliance with Nazi Germany.|$|E

5|$|During {{his second}} round match, O'Sullivan {{opened up a}} four frame {{advantage}} over Murphy in the first session to lead 6−2. In the second session, O'Sullivan maintained his advantage to lead 10−6 going into the final session. The third session saw no comeback from Murphy and O'Sullivan progressed to the quarter-finals 13−7. The quarter-finals would be the furthest O'Sullivan would progress, as he fell behind Ding Junhui 6–10 after the opening two sessions. Despite scoring the tournament's highest break with a 146 in the final session, he would eventually lose 10–13. Following his loss, O'Sullivan stated {{that he had no}} intention <b>of</b> <b>retiring.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} <b>of</b> <b>retiring</b> significant names {{was started}} during 1955 by the United States Weather Bureau in the Atlantic basin, after hurricanes Carol, Edna, and Hazel struck the Northeastern United States and caused {{a significant amount}} of damage in the previous year. Initially the names were only designed to be retired for ten years after which they might be reintroduced, however, it was decided at the 1969 Interdepartmental hurricane conference that any significant hurricane in the future would have its name permanently retired. Several names have been removed from the Pacific naming lists for various reasons other than for causing {{a significant amount of}} death/destruction, which include being pronounced in a very similar way to other names and for political reasons.|$|E
5|$|White by {{then was}} in failing health, but {{made no move}} to resign when Harding was sworn in on March 4, 1921. Taft called on the chief justice on March 26, and found White ill, but still {{carrying}} on his work and not talking <b>of</b> <b>retiring.</b> White did not retire, dying in office on May 19, 1921. Taft issued a tribute to the man he had appointed to the center seat, and waited and worried if he would be White's successor. Despite widespread speculation Taft would be the pick, Harding made no quick announcement. Taft was lobbying for himself behind the scenes, especially with the Ohio politicians who formed Harding's inner circle.|$|E

5|$|Blaine {{accepted}} his narrow defeat and {{spent most of}} the next year working on the second volume of Twenty Years of Congress. The book continued to earn him enough money to support his lavish household and pay off his debts. Although he spoke to friends <b>of</b> <b>retiring</b> from politics, Blaine still attended dinners and commented on the Cleveland administration’s policies. By the time of the 1886 Congressional elections, Blaine was giving speeches and promoting Republican candidates, especially {{in his home state of}} Maine. Republicans were successful in Maine, and after the Maine elections in September, Blaine went on a speaking tour from Pennsylvania to Tennessee, hoping to boost the prospects of Republican candidates there. Republicans were less successful nationwide, gaining seats in the House while losing seats in the Senate, but Blaine’s speeches kept him and his opinions in the spotlight.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} brought Cardus to England in 1948 was the {{prospect}} of succeeding Newman, whose retirement as chief music critic of The Sunday Times {{was assumed to be}} imminent. However, Newman had no intention <b>of</b> <b>retiring,</b> and {{made it clear that he}} would resent any successor-designate looking over his shoulder. Feeling slighted, Cardus resigned from the paper and accepted an offer from the London Evening Standard to be its music critic. This new appointment was short-lived; Cardus's lengthy and discursive concert reviews were incompatible with this paper's style, and were ruthlessly cut by subeditors. At the end of 1948 he was back in Australia, proclaiming his intention to settle there permanently. This determination, too, was brief; the lure of London life proved irresistible. Because of the commercial success of his Autobiography, published in 1947, and the immediate commissioning of a second autobiographical work, Cardus was not under immediate financial pressure. He left Australia again in the spring of 1949, and although he spent the English winter of 1950–51 in Australia, writing about the 1950–51 England v. Australia Test series for the Sydney Morning Herald, London was thereafter his permanent home. Here he worked as a freelance writer, in which role he resumed his association with The Manchester Guardian. In December 1951 he was appointed the paper's London music critic, on a permanent salaried basis.|$|E
5|$|In 737, Asad again led {{his troops}} {{north of the}} Oxus in a retaliatory {{campaign}} against Khuttal, whose ruler had allied himself with both Harith and the Turgesh. While Asad captured a few fortresses and pillaged the land, the Khuttalan regent, Ibn al-Sa'iji, called for aid from the Turgesh khagan, Suluk. The Turgesh army's arrival caught the Arab troops, widely dispersed while ravaging the countryside, by surprise, and precipitated a headlong flight across the Oxus. The Turgesh followed after them and attacked and almost annihilated the Arab baggage train, which Asad had sent ahead. The timely arrival of Asad's main army saved the baggage train's remnants, before both sides settled for winter quarters. Ominously for the Arabs, the khagan remained in Khurasan instead <b>of</b> <b>retiring</b> north, and Harith now emerged from hiding and joined him. Harith now counselled the khagan {{to take advantage of}} the dispersal of the Arab army to its winter quarters, and to resume his advance. In early December the khagan led the Turgesh army, 30,000 strong with contingents from virtually every native ruler of Transoxiana and Upper Tokharistan, south. They bypassed Balkh and marched into Juzjan, hoping to raise the Hephthalite princes of Lower Tokharistan in revolt as well. In this the Turgesh failed, as the king of Juzjan joined Asad, who was approaching with what forces he could muster. Asad's advance caught the khagan and Harith off guard; Asad came upon them near Kharistan, where they were accompanied by only 4,000 men, the rest having scattered to plunder and forage. In the ensuing Battle of Kharistan, Asad routed the Turgesh. Harith and the khagan barely escaped and fled north over the Oxus. The Turgesh detachments south of the Oxus were largely destroyed piecemeal by Juday' al-Kirmani, ending the threat to Khurasan.|$|E
