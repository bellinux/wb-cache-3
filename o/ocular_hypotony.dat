Lupus flare represents an important issue because of its potential threat in organ damage and drug toxicity after adjusting the dosage of immune-modulating agents. A 34 -year-old female was referred for trabeculectomy surgery for her poor-controlled steroid-related glaucoma with a 5 -year history of SLE under systemic steroids control. Remission status was confirmed with normal serum complement levels. However, lupus flare with clinical <b>ocular</b> findings as <b>hypotony</b> maculopathy presented 1 -week after uneventful surgery.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of phacoemulsification for management of post-filtering <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony.</b> Methods: This prospective interventional case series study recruited 21 consecutive patients with an established diagnosis of <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony</b> with or without maculopathy. Clear corneal incision phacoemulsification was done for all patients. Nineteen cases that completed a follow-up of at least 6 months were considered for final analysis. Results: Mean baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) was 2. 95 ± 1. 43 mm Hg, which increased to 8. 84 ± 4. 67 mm Hg at 6 months (P < 0. 001). Hypotony was resolved in 13 cases (68 %) at 6 months while 6 cases (32 %) showed persistent hypotony at this time point. Postoperative IOP change at all follow-up time points was not correlated with patient age, time interval between filtering surgery and phacoemulsification, baseline IOP, baseline anterior chamber depth and IOP on the first postoperative day. Three cases (16 %) showed filtering bleb failure with dramatic IOP rise around the first postoperative month and required glaucoma medication for IOP control. No significant intra- or postoperative complications were noted. Conclusion: Cataract surgery alone seems promising in resolving hypotony in patients with post-filtering <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony,</b> and {{can be considered as}} an effective treatment modality before proceeding to more complicated procedures...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} {{preliminary}} study, performed on post-surgical hypotony, was {{the evaluation of the}} effects on <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony</b> of the concomitant administration of ibopamine and corticosteroids. Methods: 14 patients (11 males - 3 females; mean age 47 years) with <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony</b> following several vitroretinal surgical intervention in different districts, were enrolled. The inclusion criteria were: mean IOP during tonometric curve equal or lower than 6 mmHg, stable IOP for at least 60 days, ongoing treatment with 0. 1 % dexamethasone (4 times/day), successful surgical intervention, 2 % ibopamine (4 times/day) was added to the corticosteroid therapy for 30 - 60 days. Results: Before ibopamine administration, mean IOP was 4. 07 mmHg SD 1. 71. At the end of the treatment period, mean IOP increased by 89 % in comparison to baseline values (+ 3. 64 mmHg SD 5. 57). This difference was statistically significant (paired t = 2. 39; P = 0. 03). One month after ibopamine-treatment discontinuation, mean IOP decreased to pre-treatment values (4. 86 mmHg SD 3. 50). Conclusions: The results of the present study, although preliminary, suggest the possibility of a future pharmacological treatment of <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony</b> with ibopamine, whose rationale is based on the increase of aqueous humor production by stimulating the D 1 dopaminergic receptor...|$|E

40|$|Importance: The {{purpose of}} this case report is to {{evaluate}} risk factors associated with post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony</b> compared to post-CABG ischemic optic neuropathy. Observations: The patient described here is a single case at the University of California, Irvine Medical Center, from July 2016. This case demonstrates the rare incidence of acute post-CABG <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony</b> and vision loss in a patient with prior history of optic atrophy. Both vision loss and hypotony resolved completely to baseline without intervention within 3 days postoperatively. Conclusions and Relevance: Severe anemia and large fluctuations in central venous pressure and blood pressure can occur in any patient undergoing CABG surgery. These hemodynamic shifts can cause transient ischemia to pressure controlling systems such as the ciliary body and reduce episcleral venous pressure. Other risk factors for acute hypotony {{in the setting of}} CABG surgery also include the use of hypertonic agents, cardiopulmonary bypass, and intravenous anesthesia...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Ibopamine is a non-selective dopamine- and adrenalin-receptor agonist {{that has}} been shown to cause pupillary {{dilation}} and an increase in aqueous humour secretion. This novel drug {{can be used as a}} mydriatic agent, as a provocative test in open-angle glaucoma, and for the treatment of persisting <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony.</b> HISTORY AND SIGNS: This 47 -year-old man had a history of uveitis associated with Crohn's disease. Six years after deep sclerectomy for uveitic secondary glaucoma, he developed severe hypotony in his left eye with drop of visual acuity (VA). The hypotony did not respond to topical steroid treatment. 2 % Ibopamine solution was ordered t. i. d. concomitant to 1 % prednisolone acetate. THERAPY AND OUTCOME: Intraocular pressure (IOP) began to rise after 3 weeks of Ibopamine treatment and returned to normal (12 mmHg) with continuous recovery of VA after 8 weeks. Ibopamine was discontinued at an IOP of 16 mmHg after a course of 12 weeks. IOP and VA remained stable during the 12 -month follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Ibopamine 2 % eye drops in combination with topical steroids are a therapeutic option in uveitis-associated <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony...</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Myotonic {{dystrophy}} is an {{autosomal dominant}} form of muscular dystrophy {{associated with a}} mutation that affects a gene on chromosome 19. Extremely low intraocular pressure {{is one of a}} constellation of clinical signs that sometimes accompany this disorder. This study was performed to determine if the <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony</b> can be explained by aqueous humor hyposecretion. Methods. Seventeen persons with myotonic dystrophy and seventeen age-matched controls were studied. Intraocular pressure, light scattering (flare), fluorescein clearance at various times of day, and the response of the eye to the topical timolol were measured. Results. Intraocular pressure was 40 % lower in the persons with myotonic dystrophy (8. 4 mm Hg vs 14. 0 mm Hg) and flare was 50 % higher (55. 8 mg/dl albumin equivalent vs 37. 1 mg/dl albumin equivalent). Fluorescein clearance in persons with myotonic dystrophy was indistinguishable from normal at all times of day. Myotonic eyes responded normally to topical timolol. The physiological data of this study are most consistent with the conclusion that the rate of aqueous humor flow is reduced approximately 9 %, and the rate of inward leakage of light scattering proteins is increased approximately 37 % in well-established myotonic dystrophy with <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony...</b>|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{report on}} a new {{treatment}} for hyperfiltering bleb {{as well as its}} diagnostic criteria. METHODS: Twenty eyes with hypotony due to hyperfiltering bleb caused by trabeculectomy with mitomicin C were treated with bleb resection. The diagnosis of hyperfiltering bleb followed these criteria: intraocular pressure lower than six mmHg (Goldmann tonometer); no inflammation in the anterior segment; presence of an elevated and/or diffuse and avascular bleb with or without microcysts; negative Seidel test; no ciliochoroidal detachment found with ultrasound biomicroscopy. We registered the following data pre and post operatively: type of glaucoma, visual acuity, bleb aspect and fundoscopic findings. A successful resolution of hypotony was achieved when intraocular pressure ranged from six to 14 mmHg with or without antiglaucomatous medication. RESULTS: At a minimum follow-up of 19 months <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony</b> had been reversed in all eyes. At the last exam, intraocular pressure varied from eight to 14 mmHg in 18 (90 %) eyes; 12 (66. 7 %) eyes had no medication and six (33. 3 %) used antiglaucomatous medication. In two (10 %) eyes, another trabeculectomy was necessary to control intraocular pressure. Hypotonic maculopathy developed preoperatively in seven eyes and was reversed after bleb resection. Visual acuity improved in 15 (75 %) eyes but did not change in five (25 %). CONCLUSION: Bleb resection is a safe and adequate treatment for <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony</b> due to hyperfiltering bleb. It also restores vision in a considerable number of patients. The diagnosis of hyperfiltering bleb must follow rigorous criteria...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ocular</b> <b>hypotony</b> due to choroidal {{detachment}} (CD) following endocyclophotocoagulation (ECP) is transient. If hypotony {{lasts for}} more than 1 week, it could affect vision.

After 5 months, the intraocular pressure was restored to 16 mmHg with one topical glaucoma medication, uncorrected vision improved to 20 / 300, and with aphakic soft contact lens, it was 20 / 50. Ophthalmologists facing such complications need not panic and manage hypotony, and the prognosis of such intervention seems to be promising...|$|E

40|$|Ibopamine as eyedrops, {{following}} adminis-tration in the conjunctival sac, {{is readily}} hy-drolysed to epinine, a dopamine analogue, by the esterases {{present in the}} aqueous hu¬mour and in the ocular tissues. lbopamine stimulates a-adrenergic recep¬tors and D-l dopaminergic receptors at ocu¬lar level. The non-cycloplegic mydriatic effect of ibopamine is due to an a-adrenergic stimu¬lation, while the D-l dopaminergic activity determines an increase in aqueous humour production. lbopamine induces a marked short-term non-cycloplegic mydriasis, lacking both top¬ical and systemic undesireble side-effects,, which enables its use in the diagnostic exam-ination of the ocular fundus, particularly in the newborn and pediatric patients. lbopamine may be employed to substitute phenylephrine in the association with tropi¬camide and/ or cyclopentolate; moreover it proves to be effective as a mydriatic prior to and after surgical procedures. The D-l dopaminergic activity of ibopamine represents the more interesting property of the drug under different aspects: in the diag¬nosis of glaucoma, {{in the treatment of}} <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony</b> and in studies on the physiopathol¬ogy of the intraocular pressure. Several clin¬ical investigations confirmed the usefulness of ibopamine in the diagnostic iter of glau¬coma as a pharmacological test to evaluate the functionality of the outflow pathways of the aqueous humour. The test is simple to perform; positive in 92 % of patients suffer¬ing from open-angle glaucoma, while it is negative in the healthy eye. lts use is recom¬mended in relatives of glaucomatous pa¬tients. The increase in aqueous humour production induced by ibopamine proves to be very use¬ful in the treatment of <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony</b> fol¬lowing vitreo-retinal or antiglaucomatous filtering surgery and in the treatment in chronic hypotony secondary to long-lasting uveitis...|$|E

During implantation, the manufacturer recommends to cover the sclerotomy site with a patch of processed human pericardium to prevent postoperative hypotony and conjunctival erosion by the underlying electronics case. Due to biomedical regulations prohibiting {{the use of this}} material in France, we developed an alternative technique combining a scleral flap protecting the sclerotomy and an autogenous graft of superior temporalis fascia overlying the electronics case. Methods: The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe the 4 -year outcomes of this modified procedure in three subjects who underwent Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System implantation. Clinical data consisting of intraocular pressure measurements and tolerance in terms of conjunctival erosion or inflammation were retrospectively assessed over a 4 -year postoperative follow-up. Results: None of the three patients implanted with the modified technique developed <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony</b> over 4 years. A normal, transient conjunctival inflammation occurred during the first postoperative month but conjunctival erosion was not observed in any of the three patients over 4 years. Four years after implantation, the autogenous temporalis fascia graft remained well tolerated and the retinal prosthesis was functional in all three patients. Conclusion: The combination of an autograft of superficial temporalis fascia and a scleral flap efficiently prevented leakage through the sclerotomy site, <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony,</b> and conjunctival erosion by the extrascleral electronics case. This modified technique is suitable for the implantation of existing and forthcoming retinal prostheses. Superficial temporalis fascia may also be used as alternative to commercial tectonic tissues for scleral wound repair in clinical settings where they are not available.

40|$|SUMMARY: We {{report the}} MR imaging {{findings}} of {{an unusually large}} fluid collection, so-called giant reservoir, around an Ahmed glaucoma valve implant that caused progressive proptosis in a patient with posttraumatic glaucoma. Although other cystic lesions of the juxtalacrimal area of the orbit, such as dermoid cyst, can present similar imaging findings, the characteristic morphology and location should lead the radiologist to the correct nature of this cystic lesion. Glaucoma drainage devices provide an alternative treat-ment in complicated and refractory glaucoma cases. 1, 2 The Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) implant (New World Medical, Rancho Cucamonga, Calif) is 1 of the common ocu-lar tube devices currently used for this surgical technique. To prevent <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony,</b> it has a unidirectional valve designed to offer a set resistance to the aqueous outflow from the ante-rior chamber with an intraocular pressure of 8 mm Hg or less. 3, 4 The aqueous humor forms a fibrous encapsulated bleb on the endplate of the implant, which is resorbed through intercellular spaces and the lymphatic system of the adjacen...|$|E
30|$|Demographic data, {{anatomic}} classification, {{association with}} uveitis, best corrected visual acuity, onset of uveitis {{and the time}} at which glaucoma was diagnosed were recorded for each patient. The presence of typical uveitis-related complications were documented, e.g. band keratopathy, cataract formation, secondary glaucoma (presence of typical glaucomatous disc cupping as measured by biomicroscopy), posterior synechies, vitreous opacities, macular oedema, <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony,</b> phthisis or retinal detachment. In addition, the number of topical and systemic antiglaucomatous and immunosuppressive medications administered was documented. In addition, the number of previous surgeries, especially transscleral diode cyclophotocoagulation (TDCPC), and lens status were evaluated. Assessment of IOP was done by Goldman applanation tonometry after topical anaesthesia between 8 and 12  a.m. Patients were also on their regular scheme for application of IOP-reducing topical medications. Surgery was performed in all patients after quiescence of inflammation was achieved for at least 2  months. All patients received topical unpreserved dexamethasone phosphate 1 % eye drops five times daily for 1  week prior to surgery to reduce conjunctival inflammation [9]. Topical and systemic antiglaucomatous medications had to be continued until surgery due to the high range of IOP.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Ocular</b> <b>hypotony</b> {{results in}} an {{increased}} break down of the blood-aqueous barrier {{and an increase in}} inflammatory mediator release. We postulate that this release may lead to an increased risk of trabeculectomy failure through increased bleb scarring. This study was designed to try to address the question if hypotony within one month of trabeculectomy for Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG), is a risk factor for future failure of the filter. Methods We performed a retrospective, case notes review, of patients who underwent trabeculectomy for POAG between Jan 1995 and Jan 1996 at our hospital. We identified those with postoperative hypotony within 1 month of surgery. Hypotony was defined as an intraocular pressure (IOP) 21 mmHg, or commencement of topical antihypertensives or repeat surgery. Results 97 cases matched our inclusion criteria, of these 38 (39 %) experienced hypotony within 1 month of surgery. We compared the survival times in those patients who developed hypotony with those who did not using the log-rank test. This data provided evidence of a difference (P = 0. 0492) with patients in the hypotony group failing more rapidly than the control group. Conclusion Early post-trabeculectomy hypotony (within 1 month) is associated with reduced survival time of blebs. </p...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} the clinical features of complicated retinal detachment secondary to acute retinal necrosis (ARN) and {{to present the}} long-term results of vitreous surgery in these cases. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 16 immunocompetent patients (18 eyes). The average follow-up period was 60 months. Results: Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) grade C, with the predominance of anterior PVR, and characteristic changes in the vitreous base area were present in all cases before surgery. All eyes underwent vitrectomy, membrane peeling, endolaser photocoagulation, and intraocular tamponade without scleral buckling. Additional procedures were performed in 13 eyes. Retinal reattachment was achieved in the 18 eyes (100 %) in the short term. Variable degrees of reproliferation occurred in all cases after surgery. Other delayed complications included <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony,</b> macular pucker, peripheral retinal neovascularization, and severe preretinal fibrosis. Improvement of visual acuity occurred in 13 eyes (72. 2 %). Eleven eyes (61. 1 %) achieved final ambulatory visual acuity of 5 / 200 or better. Conclusions: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment secondary to ARN has characteristic clinical features. Severe proliferative vitreoretinopathy with the predominance of anterior PVR develops rapidly. Reproliferation {{is the most important}} late postvitrectomy complication necessitating multiple surgical procedures in these cases.

40|$|AbstractA 29 -year-old male {{experienced}} abrupt visual loss in {{the left}} eye following an elastic cord rebounding injury that resulted in <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony.</b> He received topical atropine and prednisolone eye drops {{for more than one}} month without improvement. On examination, his visual acuity was 1. 0 OD and counting fingers at 80 cm OS. Initial intraocular pressure (IOP) was 15 mmHg OD and 6 mmHg OS. Gonioscopic evaluation of his left eye revealed a cyclodialysis cleft positioned between 6 and 7 o'clock. A fundus photograph showed signs of hypotony maculopathy including optic disc edema, tortuous vessels, and chorioretinal folds. B-scan ultrasound displayed choroidal thickening and optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated macular edema, subretinal fluid, retinal striae, and choroidal folds. Pars plana vitrectomy and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) tamponade were performed. After gas absorption, IOP was 11 mmHg OS and remained steady during follow-up. One week after surgery, his visual acuity improved to 0. 9. The present case highlights that pars plana vitrectomy with gas tamponade is worth considering for patients with cyclodialysis cleft associated with hypotony maculopathy. Early surgical intervention remains the treatment of choice when hypotony maculopathy and deteriorated vision are noted. Conservative management may be suitable in cases when visual function is not impaired...|$|E
40|$|Glaucoma is {{the leading}} cause of {{irreversible}} blindness worldwide. An increased intraocular pressure (IOP) is known as major risk factor. Currently, drainage devices that are implanted by means of minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) represent a promising approach for IOP low-ering. Commercially available devices for MIGS suffer from unregulated drainage involving <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony.</b> Further-more, long term drainage capability of current devices is limited by fibrotic encapsulation processes. Therefore, our group focusses on the development of a valved drug-eluting microstent for MIGS. Within the current work, we developed two alternative injector devices for minimally invasive mi-crostent implantation. Both injector devices were based on a cannula in which the microstent is loaded and a mandrel inside the cannula. Injector device A is designed to push the microstent out of the cannula and injector device B is de-signed to withdraw the cannula above the microstent. Manu-facturing of injector devices was conducted using rapid prototyping. Simplified polymeric microstents were manu-factured from polycarbonate based silicone elastomer. Simulated use was performed in a silicone eye model. The presented injector devices were suitable for minimally in-vasive ab interno microstent implantation into suprachoroidal space. Ongoing miniaturization of the microstent system will allow the use of a 22 G cannula in future ex vivo experiments...|$|E
40|$|Aims : To {{report a}} {{prospective}} non-comparative consecutive interventional {{study on the}} safety and efficacy of 23 -Gauge transconjunctival sutureless pars plana vitrectomy for primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). Materials and Methods: Fifty eyes of 50 consecutive patients were recruited between June 2007 and January 2008. All surgeries were performed using the one-step 23 -Gauge system with angled incisions. The surgical protocol consisted of a minimum of eight clinical visits: baseline, 1 day, 1 week, 1 -, 3 - and 6 - months after the initial surgery. The endpoints were anatomical, functional results and complications arising from the surgery. Results : Anatomical success was achieved in 82 % of cases (41 out of 50) with single surgery and rose to 98 % (49 out of 50) with additional surgery. Mean visual acuity improved from logMAR 0. 48 (SD 0. 36) to 0. 26 (SD 0. 31), P < 0. 001. Two cases with <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony,</b> defined as an intraocular pressure ≤ 6 mmHg, that were associated with a choroidal detachment were seen. Conclusions : Acceptable anatomical and functional success rates can be achieved with primary 23 -Gauge transconjunctival sutureless vitrectomy for RRD. We found that the approach technique is different from conventional vitrectomy and the complications arising from post surgical hypotony and leakage from sclerotomies are potentially higher compared to 20 -Gauge vitrectomy...|$|E

METHODS: Glaucoma patients underwent (same eye) the ibopamine provocative test with two concentrations, 1 % and 2 %, in a random sequence at least 3 weeks apart, {{but not more than}} 3 months. The normal individuals were randomly submitted to one of the concentrations of ibopamine (1 % and 2 %). The test was considered positive if there was an IOP rise greater than 3 or 4 mmHg at 30 or 45 minutes to test which subset of the test has the best sensitivity (Se) /specificity (Sp). RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in any of the IOP measurements, comparing 1 % with 2 % ibopamine. The IOP was significantly higher at 30 and 45 minutes with both concentrations (p< 0. 001). The best sensitivity/specificity ratio was achieved with the cutoff point set as greater than 3 mmHg at 45 minutes with 2 % ibopamine (area under the ROC curve: 0. 864, Se: 84. 6 %; Sp: 73. 3 %). All patients described a slight burning after ibopamine's instillation. CONCLUSION: 2 % ibopamine is recommended as a provocative test for glaucoma. Because both concentrations have similar ability to rise IOP, 1 % ibopamine may be used to treat <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony...</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the anterior keratoprosthesis-cornea interface in eyes with Boston type I keratoprosthesis (Kpro). Methods: In a prospective non-interventional study, patients with Boston type I Kpro underwent ultra-high resolution {{optical coherence tomography}} (UHR-OCT) evaluation. The images were used to measure and describe characteristics of the anterior keratoprosthesis-cornea interface, epithelial interaction at the keratoprosthesis edge and the keratoprosthesis-cornea interface gap. Results: Ten patients including 4 male and 6 female subjects with different preoperative diagnoses, i. e. 8 multiple corneal graft failures and 2 immunological ocular surface diseases, were studied. Mean age was 62. 1 ± 20. 0 (range, 33. 0 - 83. 0) years and mean interval between surgery and UHR-OCT evaluation was 15. 2 ± 11. 09 months. In eight patients, 360 ° epithelial growth over the peripheral edge of the Kpro was documented. We detected keratoprosthesis-cornea interface gap in three patients. One subject had developed postoperative endophthalmitis 8 months after surgery {{and the other two}} cases were among the high risk group according to the preoperative diagnosis. In one patient with severe <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony,</b> the Kpro edge was inserted into the anterior stroma and covered with epithelium. Conclusion: UHR-OCT showed that corneal epithelium covers the Kpro edge and seals the potential space between the Kpro and cornea in 80 % of cases. The presence of a gap in the interface and lack of epithelial sealing around the Kpro edge might be associated with endophthalmitis...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{needling}} {{procedure is}} the standard method for restoring the function of an encapsulated bleb after trabeculectomy. However, postoperative hypotony represents a possible hazard. This study describes a new surgical approach for treating encapsulated blebs with reduced risk of early postoperative hypotony: bleb needling combined with transconjunctival sutures tightening the scleral flap directly. The study included two groups of 23 patients with failing bleb following trabeculectomy: "Group 1 " underwent simple needling revision of the filtering bleb {{and served as a}} control group, while "Group 2 " received needling revision with additional transconjunctival scleral flap sutures, if intraoperatively the intraocular pressure was estimated to be very low. Intraocular pressure (IOP), postoperative management and complications were analyzed over a follow-up period of 4 weeks postoperatively. Results were compared using t-test or Mann-Whitney U-tests. Adverse effects occurred with a higher frequency after sole needling of the bleb (5 cases of choroidal effusion and 1 case of choroidal hemorrhage) than after the combined method with additional scleral sutures (1 case of choroidal effusion). The IOP on the first postoperative day was significantly lower in group 1, with 9. 43 ± 9. 01 mm Hg vs. 16. 43 ± 8. 35 mm Hg in group 2 (P = 0. 01). Ten patients with <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony</b> (IOD of 5 mmHg or lower) were found in group 1 and only two in group 2. One week and one month after surgery the intraocular pressure was similar in both groups (P> 0. 05). This new needling technique with additional transconjunctival scleral flap sutures appears to reduce postoperative hypotony, and may thus protect from further complications, such as subchoroidal hemorrhage...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{verify the}} {{influence}} of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ophthalmic solution on the intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction induced by 0. 005 % latanoprost and 0. 5 % timolol eyedrops, in patients affected by primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Methods Randomized, prospective, masked clinical study. Thirty-two POAG adults, compensated with 0. 5 % timolol, were randomized into two study groups (A and B). Timolol was continued for two weeks in all patients. At the 3 rd week, group A started a 5 -week therapy with topical 0. 1 % diclofenac, whereas placebo were administered to group B. On the 15 th day, in both groups timolol was replaced by latanoprost, and this regimen lasted for eight weeks. IOP was recorded at 7 -day intervals during the first seven weeks and at the 10 th week. Results NSAID and placebo did not modify the IOP-lowering effect induced by timolol. In both groups, latanoprost induced a significant IOP decrease. NSAID-treated patients exhibited a marked fall in IOP (p < 0. 01) whereas, in placebo-treated patients, this diminution was less noticeable (p < 0. 05). After NSAID withdrawal, in group A IOP significantly increased (p < 0. 01), remaining approximately at the same level up {{to the end of the}} study. In group B there were no significant differences in IOP at the same checks. Conclusion In POAG patients, diclofenac significantly enhances the latanoprost-induced IOP-lowering effect, without affecting the timolol hypotensive efficacy. The synergism between NSAID and latanoprost could represent an advantage, but also an unconsidered risk of <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony,</b> during the long-term treatment of glaucomatous patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Topically {{administered}} 2 % ibopamine (a dopaminergic agonist) induces a transitory ocular hypertension in 92 % {{of patients}} with primary open-angle glaucoma and in 52 % {{of patients with}} normal tension glaucoma. In normal eyes, ibopamine {{has no effect on}} IOP. Purpose: The aim {{of the present study was}} to verify, by means of fluorophotometric techniques, which hydrodynamic changes could be induced in normal and glaucomatous eyes, stimulating the D 1 receptor with 2 % ibopamine administered topically. In addiction, we wanted to evaluate if ibopamine could modify IOP before and after an experimentally induced outflow system impairment in rabbits. Methods: In study 1 we performed a measurement of aqueous humor flow in 6 healthy volunteers and in 6 glaucomatous patients, before and after 2 % ibopamine administration. In study 2 the alteration of outflow pathways was induced by means of Laminaria Digitata in 10 rabbits. Results: After 2 % ibopamine administration we found a significant increase in aqueous humor production, both in glaucomatous (P = 0. 035) and normal eyes (P = 0. 004). In rabbits, we found no significant change in IOP at basal conditions. After experimentally induced outflow system impairment by laminaria, we observed a marked increase in IOP (+ 13. 5 mmHg SD 7. 2; P < = 0. 001) following ibopamine administration. Conclusions: These experimental data have a diagnostic value in glaucoma, since they show how an intraocular hypertensive response due to ibopamine in normotensive eyes is a sign of initial outflow impairment, Moreover, the possibility to increase the aqueous humor production sets new trends in the treatment of post surgical <b>ocular</b> <b>hypotony...</b>|$|E
