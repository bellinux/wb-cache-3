From 1938 to 1940, he edited a new edition of Tribuna in Cluj, as both the FRN's <b>official</b> <b>paper</b> and Transylvania's only daily. Toward the end of the 1930s, he wrote in opposition to the revisionist policy of the Kingdom of Hungary, and in August 1940, after the Second Vienna Award granted Northern Transylvania to Hungary, he fled Cluj for Sibiu. The new authorities called for his expulsion, but he received the order after he had departed Cluj.|$|E

25|$|William was {{encouraged}} by the great parliamentarian and abolitionist, William Wilberforce, to continue his work against the slave trade in Antigua. The work would be arduous and unpaid, but he agreed to undertake it, and in 1813 he traveled to Antigua {{with his wife and}} daughter Judith. In spite of his frequently poor health, his endeavors met with great success. His main duties involved founding and operating schools for the children of slaves. He also worked as a correspondent for the Church Missionary Society's <b>official</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|E
25|$|From the 1920s Ireland {{had high}} trade {{barriers}} {{such as high}} tariffs, particularly during the Economic War with Britain in the 1930s, and a policy of import substitution. During the 1950s, 400,000 people emigrated from Ireland. It became increasingly clear that economic nationalism was unsustainable. While other European countries enjoyed fast growth, Ireland suffered economic stagnation. The policy changes were drawn together in Economic Development, an <b>official</b> <b>paper</b> published in 1958 that advocated free trade, foreign investment, and growth rather than fiscal restraint as the prime objective of economic management.|$|E

2500|$|But {{the freshly}} {{constituted}} party {{still had to}} impose itself on the political stage, spread its ideology and rally the supporters of a still-powerful Destour. It also had to convince lower classes that the Neo Destour was their defender, inviting them to join and recover a [...] "dignity manhandled by {{half a century of}} protectorate". In order to do so, tours were organized throughout the country, which drew a distinction between the new and old parties in their communication field. Despite its significant influence, the Destour did not succeed in mobilizing the illiterate masses whose political weight was still not existing. Cells were created and a structure was formed all around the country, making the Neo Destour a powerful engine more effective than all the preceding nationalist formations. If the elders addressed the colonial power to express their requests, the secessionists addressed the people. To reach these aims, Tahar Sfar created El Amal, an Arabic version of L'Action Tunisienne, which became the party's <b>official</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The interim {{president}} of the Republic of Texas, David G. Burnet, requested that Borden bring the press to Harrisburg, where the interim government had fled. [...] The Bordens successfully set up the press in Harrisburg, and on April 13 the Telegraph was named the <b>official</b> <b>paper</b> of the Republic of Texas. [...] The following day they began printing the first issue in Harrisburg. [...] It contained extracts from the Constitution of the Republic of Texas and a proclamation from Burnet calling all men to arms. [...] Only six issues were printed. [...] Shortly after the sixth sheet was printed on April 14, Mexican soldiers arrived in Harrisburg and seized the press. [...] The soldiers threw the type and press into Buffalo Bayou and arrested the printers. [...] The Texas Revolution ended one week later, when Santa Anna was captured following the Mexican defeat at the Battle of San Jacinto. [...] For the next few months, there were no newspapers in Texas.|$|E

[Footnote: The original of this peculiarly interesting document, written on <b>official</b> <b>paper,</b> was kept in a tin box under lock at the Captain-General's office, Santa Cruz, and in 1864 it was transferred to the archives of Madrid. The writing is that of a secretary, who put by mistake 1796 for 1797. A copy of it, published in Harrison's Life of Nelson (vol. i. p. 215), was thence transferred to Nicolas's Despatches and Letters. It is bonâ fide the first appearance of Nelson's signature with his left hand, despite the number of 'first signatures' owned by the curious of England.] ...|$|E
