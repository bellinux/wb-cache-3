5|$|On 2 March 2003, Arsenal {{opened up}} an eight-point lead {{at the top}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> winning 2–0 against Charlton Athletic. The result was enough for Irish {{bookmaker}} Paddy Power to pay out on punters backing Arsenal to retain their lead, despite Manchester United having a game in hand. The gap was cut to two points after Arsenal suffered their first defeat in 2003, against Blackburn Rovers. By the time Arsenal played Everton on 23 March 2003, they were displaced at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> by Manchester United. A goal by Vieira moved the team two points clear once more.|$|E

5|$|Although {{precursors}} to {{this table}} exist, its invention is generally credited to Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. Mendeleev invented {{the table to}} illustrate recurring ("periodic") trends in {{the properties of the}} elements. The layout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> has been refined and extended over time, as new elements have been discovered, and new theoretical models have been developed to explain chemical behavior.|$|E
5|$|From left {{to right}} across the {{standard}} form of periodic table, as metallic character decreases, nonmetals therefore adopt structures that show a gradual reduction {{in the numbers of}} nearest neighbours—three or two for the polyatomic nonmetals, through one for the diatomic nonmetals, to zero for the monatomic noble gases. A similar pattern occurs more generally, {{at the level of the}} entire periodic table, in comparing metals and nonmetals. There is a transition from metallic bonding among the metals on the left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> through to covalent or Van der Waals (electrostatic) bonding among the nonmetals on the right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Metallic bonding tends to involve close-packed centrosymmetric structures with a high number of nearest neighbours. Post-transition metals and metalloids, sandwiched between the true metals and the nonmetals, tend to have more complex structures with an intermediate number of nearest neighbours. Nonmetallic bonding, towards the right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> features open-packed directional (or disordered) structures with fewer or zero nearest neighbours. As noted, this steady reduction in the number of nearest neighbours, as metallic character decreases and nonmetallic character increases, is mirrored among the nonmetals, the structures of which gradually change from polyatomic, to diatomic, to monatomic.|$|E

5|$|In the {{periodic}} table published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside the main body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> {{at the end of}} each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals. This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871, which contained the modern carbon group (group 14), titanium group (group 4), cerium, and thorium, because their maximum oxidation state was +4. Cerium was soon removed from the main body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and placed in a separate lanthanide series; thorium was left with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as titanium and zirconium.|$|E

5|$|Manchester City {{started the}} 1936–37 season poorly, {{and were in}} the bottom half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> until December. The club were better known for goalscoring than solid defence, but {{frequently}} both eluded City; {{at one point the}} club gained just one win in twelve matches. However, Christmas proved to be a turning point for the club. Swift conceded five goals in consecutive matches on 19 and 25 December, but a Boxing Day win against Middlesbrough was the start of a long unbeaten run. By April City were second in the table, and faced a fixture against Arsenal, league leaders and the dominant club of the period. Peter Doherty inspired the team to a 2–0 win, and City reached the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> The unbeaten run continued {{until the end of the}} season, and City secured their first league championship with a 4–1 win over Sheffield Wednesday. City's third goal in this match came as the result of a long clearance by Swift, who was noted for the distance he could propel the ball.|$|E
5|$|Morgan did {{not stay}} long in Port Royal and in October 1668 sailed with ten ships and 800 men for Île-à-Vache, {{a small island}} he used as a {{rendezvous}} point. His plan was to attack the Spanish settlement of Cartagena de Indias, the richest and most important city on the Spanish Main. In December he was joined by a former Royal Navy frigate, Oxford, which {{had been sent to}} Port Royal to aid in any defence of Jamaica. Modyford sent the vessel to Morgan, who made it his flagship. On 2 January 1669 Morgan called a council of war for all his captains, which took place on Oxford. A spark in the ship's powder magazine destroyed the ship and over 200 of its crew. Morgan and the captains seated on one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> were blown into the water and survived; the four captains on the other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> were all killed.|$|E
