5|$|While Old Coast Road's dual {{carriageway}} was advancing north from Bunbury, and Kwinana Freeway was progressively being extended south from Perth, the alignment through Mandurah was constrained by existing development. Keeping the existing alignment {{would result in}} a traffic bottleneck through Mandurah. To <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem,</b> Main Roads began planning for a new route east of the Peel Inlet in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The Allied Expeditionary Air Force (AEAF) {{undertook}} over 3,200 photo reconnaissance sorties from April 1944 {{until the}} start of the invasion. Photos of the coastline were taken at extremely low altitude to show the invaders the terrain, obstacles on the beach, and defensive structures such as bunkers and gun emplacements. Inland terrain, bridges, troop emplacements, and buildings were also photographed, in many cases from several angles, to give the Allies as much information as possible. Members of Combined Operations Pilotage Parties clandestinely prepared detailed harbour maps, including depth soundings. At Gold, frogmen discovered the shore between Asnelles and La Rivière was soft and could not support the weight of tanks. Twelve Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVREs) were fitted with bobbins to <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> by deploying a roll of matting over the soft surface. The material would then be left in place to create a route for more conventional tanks.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the American {{palaeontologist}} Kenneth Carpenter {{pointed out}} that the dorsal vertebrae {{from the back of the}} pachycephalosaur Homalocephale show that the back curved downwards just before the neck (which was not preserved), and unless the neck curved upwards, the head would point to the ground. He therefore inferred that the necks of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs were held in a curved posture (as is the norm in dinosaurs), and that they would therefore not have been able to align their head, neck, and body horizontally straight, which would be needed to transmit stress. Their necks would have to be held below the level of the back, which would have risked damaging the spinal cord on impact. Modern bighorn sheep and bison <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> by having strong ligaments from the neck to the tall neural spines over the shoulders (which absorb the force of impact), but such features are not known in pachycephalosaurs. These animals also absorb the force of impact through sinus chambers at the base of their horns, and their foreheads and horns form a broad contact surface, unlike the narrow surface of pachycephalosaur domes. Because the dome of Stegoceras was rounded, it would have given a very small area for potential impact, and the domes would have glanced off each other (unless the impact was perfectly centred). Combating pachycephalosaurs would have had difficulty seeing each other while their heads were lowered, due to the bony ridges above the eyes.|$|E
50|$|Environmental weeds pose {{a serious}} threat to the {{survival}} of native flora and fauna in the reserve. Erosion is another issue of concern. Regeneration and revegetation works are slowly <b>overcoming</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|R
50|$|Helicopters <b>overcame</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> as {{they were}} able to hover over the victim and give aid by {{dropping}} a line to them with either a basket or diver to assist their extraction.|$|R
50|$|Access to {{reliable}} and uninterrupted electricity is a chronic demand in villages {{all over the}} world. The best solution for <b>overcoming</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> is utilization of alternative energy with modern advancement with implementation of off-grid system.|$|R

25|$|To <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem,</b> Schmidhuber's {{multi-level}} {{hierarchy of}} networks (1992) pre-trained one level {{at a time}} by unsupervised learning, fine-tuned by backpropagation. Behnke (2003) relied only on {{the sign of the}} gradient (Rprop) on problems such as image reconstruction and face localization.|$|E
25|$|Foul odors may be {{emitted from}} the feces vault because the {{contents}} of the feces vault have become too wet.

50|$|At the start, {{one of the}} machine's major {{drawbacks}} was {{the necessity}} of using one wash formula for all items. Modern computerized tunnel washers can monitor and adjust the chemical levels in individual pockets, effectively <b>overcoming</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{illiteracy}} {{is high in}} {{this village}} and liquor is indeed at the alarming rate and most villagers feel that the village administration has been not able to <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> <b>problems.</b> Light comes 5-6 hrs in a day.|$|R
50|$|Also, {{there is}} no {{compulsory}} stop when a red signal is passed. The newer TPWS, which is installed at certain stop signals, the approach to reductions of permissible speed {{of more than a}} third and buffer stops, <b>overcomes</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|R
25|$|The amine group, in aminoallyl-modified nucleotide, is {{reactive}} with dyes {{such as the}} cyanine series, {{or other}} patented dyes.

25|$|In a {{detailed}} study released in 2016 and less detailed studies by others suggest that once cloned animals {{get past the}} first month or two of life they are generally healthy. However, early pregnancy loss and neonatal losses are still greater with cloning than natural conception or assisted reproduction (IVF). Current research endeavors are attempting to <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} feature of this stadium is the rainwater drainage system. Often, matches are abandoned due to heavy downpour. To <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem,</b> MCA opted for sand-based outfield developed departmentally with technical assistance from STRI Limited, UK. Due to this technology, even during heavy showers, water on the outfield drained out fast making it ready for play again just in few minutes.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} version of prospect theory {{gave rise to}} violations of first-order stochastic dominance. That is, prospect A might be preferred to prospect B even if the probability of receiving a value x or greater {{is at least as}} high under prospect B as it is under prospect A for all values of x, and is greater for some value of x. Later theoretical improvements <b>overcame</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem,</b> but at the cost of introducing intransitivity in preferences. A revised version, called cumulative prospect theory <b>overcame</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> by using a probability weighting function derived from rank-dependent expected utility theory. Cumulative prospect theory can also be used for infinitely many or even continuous outcomes (for example, if the outcome can be any real number).|$|R

25|$|Undercuts from etching are {{somewhat}} {{different than the}} undercuts explained above, {{because it is a}} side effect, not an intentional feature. Undercuts from etching can occur from two common causes. The first is over etching, which means the etchant was applied too long. The second is due to an isotropic etchant, which means the etchant etches in all directions equally. To <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> an anisotropic etchant is used.|$|E
25|$|The {{median age}} of Singaporean {{residents}} is 39.3, and the total fertility rate {{is estimated to be}} 0.80 children per woman in 2014, the lowest in the world and well below the 2.1 needed to replace the population. To <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem,</b> the Singapore government has been encouraging foreigners to immigrate to Singapore for the past few decades. The large number of immigrants has kept Singapore's population from declining.|$|E
25|$|Because {{keyboards}} {{have only}} a limited number of keys, English keyboards do not have keys for accented characters. The concept of dead key, a key that modified the meaning of the next key press, was developed to <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem.</b> This acute accent key was already present on typewriters where it typed the accent without moving the carriage, so a normal letter could be written on the same place.|$|E
50|$|Scholes {{was ruled}} {{out for the}} second half of the 2005-06 {{campaign}} with blurred vision. The cause of this was initially uncertain, sparking fears that it could end his career.

5000|$|The [...] "flick pass" [...] {{had become}} a legal and common style of handpass, but its {{execution}} blurred the lines between a legal handpass and an illegal throw, leading to confusion and inconsistency on how it was policed by umpires.

50|$|As the {{telescope}} was an east-west instrument, most imaging observations involved 12-hour observations {{in order to}} fill the synthesised aperture (calibration observations are routinely interleaved). Another consequence of the geometry was {{that it is not}} practical to image sources near the equator, or in the south. The two-dimensional Large Array <b>overcomes</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> with its new north-south baselines.|$|R
25|$|Statutes {{and common}} law rules that are {{declared}} unconstitutional are void ab initio (from the beginning) – {{it is as}} if they never existed. This may create a problem as past cases decided {{on the basis of the}} unconstitutional legislation or precedent may be open to re-litigation. To <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem,</b> the Court of Appeal may apply the doctrine of prospective overruling to preserve the state of law prior to the date when the unconstitutional law is overruled.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} EVs and HEVs during their {{charging}} process draw very high current {{for a short}} duration of time which creates power pulsation on the grid. Power pulsation not only reduces {{the efficiency of the}} grid and cause voltage drop in the common coupling bus, but it can cause considerable frequency fluctuation in the entire system. To <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem,</b> supercapacitors can be implemented as an interface between the charging station and the grid to buffer the grid from the high pulse power drawn from the charging station.|$|E
25|$|As {{opposed to}} lentiviruses, {{adenoviral}} DNA does not integrate into the genome {{and is not}} replicated during cell division. This limits their use in basic research, although adenoviral vectors are still used in in vitro and also in vivo experiments. Their primary applications are in gene therapy and vaccination. Since humans commonly {{come in contact with}} adenoviruses, which cause respiratory, gastrointestinal and eye infections, majority of patients have already developed neutralizing antibodies which can inactivate the virus before it can reach the target cell. To <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> scientists are currently investigating adenoviruses that infect different species to which humans do not have immunity.|$|E
40|$|Current {{techniques}} for visualising large-scale microarray data {{are unable to}} present temporal features without {{reducing the number of}} elements being displayed.

50|$|While the Dines {{anemometer}} had {{an error}} of only 1% at 10 mi/h km/h {{it did not}} respond very well to low winds due to the poor response of the flat plate vane required to turn the head into the wind.

25|$|Glue smears and {{droplets}} {{are sometimes}} present around the joints of furniture. They {{can be removed}} {{using a combination of}} scraping, scrubbing and sanding. These approaches remove surface glue, but not the glue beneath the wood surface. Sub-surface glue will reduce the absorption of stain by wood, and may alter the scratch pattern created by sanding. Both these effects will influence {{the way in which the}} wood colours when stains are used to finish the wood. To <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> it may be necessary to locally stain and touch-up areas previously covered by glue to ensure that the finish on such areas matches that of the surrounding wood.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} – which even if {{able to be}} banded require special bands to fit the unique shape of their legs – will crush bands with their powerful bills and claws. The ability to <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> varies between species, and with some such as the Gang-gang cockatoo, it {{is known to be}} too dangerous to attempt banding. New World vultures also cannot be banded on their legs because they urinate onto their legs, causing corrosion of the bands into a powdery oxide that sticks to the vulture’s leg and injures the bird. Dippers are also dangerously handicapped by ringing because the rings induce drag that makes it extremely difficult for them to catch prey in fast-flowing water.|$|E
25|$|More-powerful {{locomotives}} {{tend to be}} longer, {{but long}} rigid-framed designs are impractical for the tight curves frequently found on narrow-gauge railways. Various designs for articulated locomotives were developed to <b>overcome</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem.</b> The Mallet and the Garratt were the two most popular, both using a single boiler and two engines (sets of cylinders and driving wheels). The Garratt has two power bogies, whereas the Mallet has one. There were also {{a few examples of}} triplex locomotives that had a third engine under the tender. Both the front and tender engines were low-pressure compounded, though they could be operated simple (high-pressure) for starting off. Other less common variations included the Fairlie locomotive, which had two boilers back-to-back on a common frame, with two separate power bogies.|$|E
