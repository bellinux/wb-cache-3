5|$|Earlier, {{the first}} {{recorded}} use <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>paper</b> {{was made in}} 589 by the scholar-official Yan Zhitui (531–591), and in 851 an Arab Muslim traveler commented on how he believed the Tang era Chinese were not careful about cleanliness {{because they did not}} wash with water (as was his people's habit) when going to the bathroom; instead, he said, the Chinese simply used paper to wipe themselves.|$|E
5|$|Toilet paper: Toilet {{paper was}} first {{mentioned}} by the Sui Chinese politician and artist Yan Zhitui (531–591) {{in the year}} 589 during the Sui Dynasty, with full evidence of continual use in subsequent dynasties. By the mid 14th century during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368), it was written that ten million packages of 1,000 to 10,000 sheets <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>paper</b> were manufactured annually in Zhejiang province alone.|$|E

Others, often in more rural, older areas in European countries, simply have a hole with two indents on either side for your feet. In Eastern societies, there is a hole in the floor, over which the user crouches. A roll <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>paper</b> is usually available. Old corn cobs, leaves, or other types of paper are also used.|$|E

25|$|In {{many parts}} of Asia, people {{traditionally}} use the toilet in a squatting position. This applies to defecation and urination by males and females. Therefore, homes and public washrooms have squat toilets, with the toilet bowl installed in the floor. This has the advantages of not needing an additional toilet seat and also being more convenient for cultures where people use water to wash their genitals instead <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>paper.</b> However, Western-style toilets that are mounted at sitting height and which have a plastic seat have become popular as well. Many public washrooms have both squatting and sitting toilets.|$|E
25|$|Morton Ann Gernsbacher, a {{professor}} of psychology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, compares the orientation <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>paper</b> to the orientation of cutlery in a dishwasher, the choice of which drawer in a chest of drawers to place one's socks, and the order of shampooing one's hair and lathering one's body in the shower. In each choice, there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority, and it is tempting to offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different. She warns that neuroimaging experiments—which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from mental rotation and facial expressions to grocery shopping and tickling—must strive to avoid such cultural bias and stereotypes.|$|E
25|$|Reducing water {{consumption}} and protecting water quality are key objectives in sustainable building. One critical issue of {{water consumption}} {{is that in}} many areas, the demands on the supplying aquifer exceed its ability to replenish itself. To the maximum extent feasible, facilities should increase their dependence on water that is collected, used, purified, and reused on-site. The protection and conservation of water throughout {{the life of a}} building may be accomplished by designing for dual plumbing that recycles water in toilet flushing or by using water for washing of the cars. Waste-water may be minimized by utilizing water conserving fixtures such as ultra-low flush toilets and low-flow shower heads. Bidets help eliminate the use <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>paper,</b> reducing sewer traffic and increasing possibilities of re-using water on-site. Point of use water treatment and heating improves both water quality and energy efficiency while reducing the amount of water in circulation. The use of non-sewage and greywater for on-site use such as site-irrigation will minimize demands on the local aquifer.|$|E

500|$|Pound {{spent three}} weeks in {{isolation}} in the heat, sleeping on the concrete, denied exercise and communication, except for conversations with the chaplain. After {{two and a half}} weeks he began to break down under the strain. Richard Sieburth wrote that Pound recorded it in Canto LXXX, where Odysseus is saved from drowning by Leucothea: [...] "hast'ou swum in a sea of air strip / through an aeon of nothingness, / when the raft broke and the waters went over me." [...] Medical staff moved him out of the cage the following week. On 14 and 15 June he was examined by psychiatrists, one of whom found symptoms of a mental breakdown, after which he was transferred to his own tent and allowed reading material. He began to write, drafting what became known as The Pisan Cantos. The existence of a few sheets <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>paper</b> showing the beginning of Canto LXXXIV suggests he started it while in the cage.|$|E

She was also a special guest star on the tenth season of American Idol on April 14, 2011. The performance featured Rihanna in a floor-length, heavily textured rose-colored gown, which she adorned as she appeared from behind flowing ceiling height curtains. Kara Warner of MTV News complimented the performance, saying [...] "the 23-year-old rocked the house with an ethereal performance of her ballad 'California King Bed. A writer of Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "It's a classy, laid-back performance with Rihanna in a lovely gown, backed up by interpretative dancers caressing large pieces of fabric that are probably meant to evoke bed sheets, but look a bit more like giant strips <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>paper</b> hanging from the ceiling. But either way, this is quite nice." [...] In March 2011, Rihanna was appointed spokeswoman for the [...] "100 Years of Skin Care" [...] Nivea Commercial campaign, which featured [...] "California King Bed" [...] as the song used in the commercials. As part of promotion for the campaign, Rihanna {{performed the}} song at private events in several European cities in May 2011, including Hamburg, Milan and Paris. The song was also performed on NBC's Today show on May 27, 2011, as part of their Summer Concert Series.

500|$|Known {{for taking}} the stage at early concerts with {{hundreds}} of clothespins attached to his hair and clothes, Haynes would often strip throughout a show until he was down to his underwear, or less, by the end. Other attire included flasher-style trench coats over his nakedness, ridiculously home-styled wigs and cross-dressing; often enjoying a skirt made of an American flag and a large '60s torpedo-style stuffed bra. At other times he would hide condoms full of stage blood in his clothes and repeatedly fall to the floor, appearing to bleed profusely. Some of Haynes' other favorite tricks involved throwing handfuls of photocopied cockroach images into the crowd, rolls and rolls <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>paper</b> tossed across the audience, as well as filling an inverted cymbal with lighter fluid, setting it (and sometimes his hand) on fire, and repeatedly hitting it with a mallet. As previously mentioned he would sing through almost anything that would alter his voice, including toilet paper rolls and megaphones early on, which eventually evolved into [...] "Gibby's kit", a.k.a. [...] "Gibbytronix," [...] a rack of vocal effects stacked as high as he could reach, before which he would often stand {{for the majority of}} the show in later performances. He also often utilized various foot switches which would be used to activate certain vocal effects, and when thought to be dancing during some performances he would actually be stepping on his various pedals. Adding to the spectacle were Coffey and Nervosa, who played in unison on stand-up drum kits; behind which they would collapse onto the floor and out of eyeshot, to collect their breath and strength before rising just in time to play the next song. Finally, the whole band would often tear apart stuffed animals while on stage, throwing the stuffing through the air, creating a rather disturbing throbbing effect, caused by the stroboscopes that were always on.|$|E
