40|$|Abstract — Instability {{and poor}} {{performance}} are two wellknown problems encountered in bilateral teleoperation over a communication channel with variable time delays, where force {{feedback from the}} slave side is provided to the master side. When unknown disturbances or external forces act on the master and/or the slave manipulators, the teleoperation system {{will be even more}} prone to stability and performance degradation. By adopting a Lyapunov approach, we present a novel nonlinear disturbance <b>observer</b> <b>based</b> <b>control</b> scheme for teleoperation systems that are subject to variable time delays and disturbances. Lumping the effects of dynamic uncertainties, unknown forces/torques exerted by the human operator and the remote environment, and external disturbances into a single disturbance term enables us to use a disturbance observer and suppress these disturbances in order to alleviate their adverse effects on the teleoperation system stability and performance. The proposed disturbance <b>observer</b> <b>based</b> <b>control</b> laws guarantee asymptotic disturbance tracking, asymptotic position tracking, and stability of teleoperation system in both constrained and free motions.

A simple PD controller is selected for the moving base regulation control, while a Lyapunov function candidate based on a very simple energy relationship is utilized for the PZT input voltage to make the closed-loop system energy dissipative and hence stable. In this paper, the PZT input voltage control uses the velocity related signals estimated by the reduced-order observer, which makes the control structure simpler.

40|$|Abstract: A novel {{control scheme}} for the active {{steering}} of railway vehicles {{is presented in}} the paper using disturbance <b>observer</b> <b>based</b> <b>control</b> (DOBC) techniques. In contrast to existing DOBC schemes which are mainly for single-input-single-output (SISO) systems and designed by trial and error, a new DOBC technique for multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems is developed. This is achieved by reforming the DOBC into the parameterisation of all stabilising controllers and then the disturbance observer is designed to minimise the inuence of disturbances. In this scheme, the disturbance observer does not have inuence on tracking/regulation performance and stability. The developed DOBC scheme is then applied to the control of railway vehicles, where an LQG controller is designed as the primal controller for the vehicle running on straight tracks and the disturbance observer is employed to improve the curving performance. This overcomes the di ¢ culty in compromising the performance and wheelset stability on straight tracks and the curving performance when a single controller is used. The simulation reveals that the curving performance of railway vehicles is improved while the straight track performance/wheelset stability remains the same. Copyright c 2005 IFA...|$|E
