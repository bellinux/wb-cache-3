According to the Damascene historian and Hasan's contemporary, Muhammad Amin al-Muhibbi, Hasan Pasha had numerous wives and concubines and fathered 85 children.

5|$|Robert Kennedy {{was chosen}} by McCarthy as a counsel for his investigatory committee, but {{resigned}} after six months due to disagreements with McCarthy and Committee Counsel Roy Marcus Cohn.

The Kennedy patriarch hoped that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons</b> would be president. Mindful of the anti-Catholic prejudice Al Smith faced during his 1928 campaign for that office, Joseph Kennedy supported McCarthy as a national Catholic politician who might {{pave the way for}} a younger Kennedy's presidential candidacy.|$|E
5|$|After Bahá'u'lláh died on 29 May 1892, the Will and Testament of Bahá'u'lláh {{named his}} son `Abdu'l-Bahá as Centre of the Covenant, {{successor}} and interpreter of Bahá'u'lláh's writings, and the appointment was readily accepted by almost all Bahá'ís, since the appointment was written and unambiguous, and `Abdu'l-Bahá had proved himself a capable and devoted assistant. However, the appointment given to `Abdu'l-Bahá was {{a cause of}} jealousy within Bahá'u'lláh's family. Bahá'u'lláh had also stated that another <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons</b> Mírzá Muhammad `Alí was to be subordinate and second in rank after `Abdu'l-Bahá. Mírzá Muḥammad `Alí, however, insisted that `Abdu'l-Bahá was exceeding his powers, and started a rebellion, at first covert, and then public to discredit `Abdu'l-Bahá. Mírzá Muḥammad `Alí's actions, however, were rejected {{by the majority of}} the Bahá'ís. Due to this conflict, `Abdu'l-Bahá later ex-communicated his brother as a covenant-breaker. The conflict was not long lived; after being alienated by the Bahá'í community, Muhammad Ali died in 1937 with a handful of followers.|$|E
