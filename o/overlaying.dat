40|$|Abstract — Recently, <b>overlay</b> {{networks}} {{have been proposed}} to provide {{a significant portion of}} value-added applications, such as resilient <b>overlay</b> routing, content distribution, <b>overlay</b> multicasting. An important module of these <b>overlay</b> networks is to timely and efficiently monitor the <b>overlay</b> link (IP path) performance between each pair of <b>overlay</b> nodes. Although several work has been proposed to achieve scalable <b>overlay</b> link monitoring, they either use a centralized solution[1] or cannot provide accurate information [2]. A distributed <b>overlay</b> link monitoring technique called Monet is proposed in this paper. Based on the proposed X-Set concept, each <b>overlay</b> node collaborates with a set of neighboring nodes (friend nodes) to determine the necessary <b>overlay</b> links to directly monitor. Whenever an <b>overlay</b> link performance query arrives, an <b>overlay</b> node can reply with accurate <b>overlay</b> link performance based on its local knowledge or by collaborating with its friend nodes.

5|$|The {{two cities}} were later pushed toward merger by a {{disaster}} that nearly {{wiped out the}} falls. The geological formation of the area consisted of a hard, thin layer of limestone <b>overlaying</b> a soft sandstone formation. As the sandstone eroded away, large blocks of limestone would fall off. The expansion of milling and industry at the falls accelerated the process of erosion. If the fragile limestone cap ever eroded away completely, the falls would turn into a rapids that would no longer provide water power. This process {{came to a head}} on October 4, 1869, when a tunnel under Hennepin Island and Nicollet Island collapsed and filled with water. With the limestone cap breached, the tunnel quickly created a torrent of water that blasted Hennepin Island and threatened to destroy the falls. The falls were shored up quickly, and over the next several years, the falls were repaired by building a wooden apron, sealing the tunnel, and building low dams above the falls to avoid exposing the limestone to the weather. This work was assisted by the federal government, and was eventually completed in 1884. The federal government spent $615,000 on this effort, while the two cities spent $334,500.

Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated full motion video (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train.

While {{this was not a}} new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect. The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory.
