They ran a successful business, and in 1882 they were purchasing direct from British suppliers <b>on</b> <b>cash</b> <b>terms.</b> Within ten years trade had increased to $110,000, staff productivity had more than doubled (to $9,200 per clerk), expenses had fallen from 16 to 11 percent of turnover and profits were averaging 10 percent. Smallman and Ingram expanded their business by acquiring new premises in 1892. They purchased adjacent properties and added shoe and toy departments (only to be discarded as insufficiently profitable). Soon an even larger location was secured. By {{the turn of the}} century the store employed more than 100 clerks.|$|E

50|$|Tariff levels do {{not allow}} for full cost recovery. In the case of AyA, there are cross-subsidies from the {{metropolitan}} area of San José to the other {{urban and rural areas}} of the country. The tariff is set based <b>on</b> short <b>term</b> <b>cash</b> flow needs rather than on real economic costs of service provision. AyA requests tariff increases when its financial situation is precarious and not a result of long-term investment planning. The regulator tends to approve these requests only partrially..|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the financing terms that support {{international trade and}} sheds light on how and why these arrangements affect trade. Using detailed transaction level data from a U. S. based exporter of frozen and refrigerated food products, primarily poultry, it begins by describing broad patterns {{about the use of}} alternative financing terms. These patterns help discipline a model in which the trade finance mode is shaped by the risk that an importer defaults on an exporter and by the possibility that an exporter does not deliver goods as specified in the contract. The empirical results indicate that transactions are more likely to occur <b>on</b> <b>cash</b> in advance or letter of credit terms when the importer is located in a country with weak contractual enforcement and in a country that is further from the exporter. Letters of credit, however, are rarely used by the exporter. As an importer develops a relationship with the exporter, transactions are less likely to occur on terms that require prepayment. During the recent crisis, the exporter was more likely to demand <b>cash</b> in advance <b>terms</b> when transacting with new customers, and customers that traded <b>on</b> <b>cash</b> in advance <b>terms</b> prior to the crisis disproportionately reduced their purchases. These results can be rationalized by the model whenever (i) misbehavior {{on the part of the}} exporter is of little concern to importers, and (ii) local banks in importing countries are typically more effective than the exporter in pursuing financial claims against importers. ...|$|R
25|$|Water {{and sewer}} tariffs in Costa Rica are {{approved}} by the regulatory agency ARESEP and instituted by AyA, the water and sewer agency for Costa Rica. Revenues from user fees do not cover {{operation and maintenance costs}} and the financial situation of the sector is weak. Furthermore, tariff levels do not allow for full cost recovery. In the case of AyA, there are cross-subsidies from San José to the other urban and rural areas of the country. The tariff is set based <b>on</b> short <b>term</b> <b>cash</b> flow needs rather than on real economic costs of service provision. AyA requests tariff increases when its financial situation is precarious and not a result of long-term investment planning. The regulator, ARESEP tends to approve a partial percentage of these requests.|$|R

30|$|The {{volatility}} of cash flow has an insignificant effect <b>on</b> <b>cash</b> holdings {{in the three}} sub-periods. This result is inconsistent with most studies that have reported a significant effect of {{volatility of}} <b>cash</b> flows <b>on</b> <b>cash</b> holdings (e.g.: Bigelli and Sánchez-Vidal 2012; Guney et al. 2007; Kariuki et al. 2015; Shabbir et al. 2016).

50|$|This {{points to}} the major role trade credit {{insurance}} plays in facilitating international trade. Trade credit is offered by vendors to their customers {{as an alternative to}} prepayment or <b>cash</b> <b>on</b> delivery <b>terms,</b> providing time for the customer to generate income from sales to pay for the product or service. This requires the vendor to assume non-payment risk. In a local or domestic situation as well as in an export transaction, the risk increases when laws, customs communications and customer's reputation are not fully understood. In addition to increased risk of non-payment, international trade presents the problem of the time between product shipment and its availability for sale. The account receivable is like a loan and represents capital invested, and often borrowed, by the vendor. But this is not a secure asset until it is paid. If the customer's debt is credit insured the large, risky asset becomes more secure, like an insured building. This asset may then be viewed as collateral by lending institutions and a loan based upon it used to defray the expenses of the transaction and to produce more product. Trade credit insurance is, therefore, a trade finance tool.|$|R

This paper directly examines whether Chinese listed firms use cash reserves to smooth their investment expenditures. We estimate the dynamic model of Brown and Petersen(2011) and the modified model of it using the data of the listed companies in China A share market from 1998 to 2010, and the total sample regression results show that Chinese listed companies face financing constraints in general and rely extensively <b>on</b> <b>cash</b> reserves to smooth their investment expenditures.
