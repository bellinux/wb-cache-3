5|$|An {{increase}} in intermarriage in the United States {{has led to}} the blurring of ethnic lines. Anti-miscegenation laws (laws banning interracial marriages) were abolished in the United States in 1967 and now it is estimated that <b>one-fifth</b> <b>of</b> the population in the United States by 2050 {{will be part of the}} polyethnic population. In 2000, self-identified Multiracial Americans numbered 6.8 million or 2.4% of the population.|$|E

5|$|For natural uranium, about 49% of its {{alpha rays}} are emitted {{by each of}} 238U atom, and also 49% by 234U (since the latter is formed from the former) and about 2.0% of them by the 235U. When the Earth was young, {{probably}} about <b>one-fifth</b> <b>of</b> its uranium was uranium-235, but the percentage of 234U was probably much lower than this.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{the section}} of M-69 east of Randville was decommissioned, and the {{concurrency}} with M-95 was removed. This truncated the highway to , approximately <b>one-fifth</b> <b>of</b> its previous length. The transfer to county control {{was part of a}} program to reduce the total state highway mileage in the state. After October 5, 1970, this section was renamed G-30 with the beginning of the County-Designated Highway program in Michigan.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April 1845, fire {{destroyed}} much of London, {{which was}} at the time largely constructed of wooden buildings. One of the first casualties was the town's only fire engine. This fire burned nearly 30 acres of land destroying 150 buildings before burning itself out later the same day. <b>One-fifth</b> <b>of</b> London was destroyed and this was the province's first million dollar fire.|$|E

It also tied for fourth in league scoring with Drayson Bowman of the Spokane Chiefs. He was selected to the WHL East First All-Star Team and received the Doc Seaman Trophy as WHL Scholastic Player of the Year (beating out defenceman Jared Cowen of the Spokane Chiefs).|$|E
5|$|Financial Times {{questioned}} why the Japanese auditor firm {{signed off}} on the financial statements in the same year when other members of its global network apparently refused to give clean bills of financial heath to Olympus subsidiaries such as Gyrus in the UK, and elsewhere. One analyst suggests the poor performance of Japanese auditors may be due to low pay, and overwork due to the shortage of certified public accountants: audit fees are up to <b>one-fifth</b> <b>of</b> that of comparable US companies; there are 17,000 CPAs in Japan, compared with 330,000 in the US.|$|E

5000|$|From 1893, the organisations began {{producing}} union {{labels for}} members to place inside hats they had made. [...] The unions undertook a major strike in 1907, {{in an attempt}} to prevent the employment of youths on certain machines. [...] The resolution of this led to an unusual position where the unions had a role in regulating apprenticeships in the industry, restricting their numbers to a maximum <b>of</b> <b>one-fifth</b> the number <b>of</b> journeymen in any workplace.|$|R
25|$|British cloth {{could not}} compete with Indian cloth because India's labor cost was {{approximately}} <b>one-fifth</b> that <b>of</b> Britain's. In 1700 and 1721 the British government passed Calico Acts {{in order to protect}} the domestic woollen and linen industries from the increasing amounts of cotton fabric imported from India.|$|R
5|$|Prevention {{of malaria}} {{may be more}} {{cost-effective}} than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the initial costs required are {{out of reach of}} many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provinces—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated <b>one-fifth</b> <b>of</b> the public health budget.|$|E
5|$|Soluble {{fluorides}} are moderately toxic: 5–10g sodium fluoride, or 32–64mg fluoride ions per kilogram of body mass, {{represents a}} lethal dose for adults. <b>One-fifth</b> <b>of</b> the lethal dose can cause adverse health effects, and chronic excess consumption {{may lead to}} skeletal fluorosis, which affects millions in Asia and Africa. Ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach which is easily absorbed by the intestines, where it crosses cell membranes, binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes, before urinary excretion. Exposure limits are determined by urine testing of the body's ability to clear fluoride ions.|$|E
5|$|The Old School faction was {{convinced}} that the Plan of Union with the Congregational churches had undermined Presbyterian doctrine and order. At the 1837 General Assembly, the Old School majority successfully passed resolutions removing all judicatories found under the Plan from the Presbyterian Church. In total, three synods in New York and one synod in Ohio along with 28 presbyteries, 509 ministers, and 60 thousand church members (<b>one-fifth</b> <b>of</b> the PCUSA's membership) were excluded from the church. New School leaders reacted by meeting in Auburn, New York, and issuing the Auburn Declaration, a 16-point defense of their Calvinist orthodoxy.|$|E

50|$|When ASC {{machines}} {{first became}} {{available in the}} early 1970s they outperformed almost all other machines, including the CDC STAR-100, and under certain conditions matched that of the infamous one-off ILLIAC IV. However only seven had been installed when the famous Cray-1 was announced in 1975. The Cray-1 dedicated almost all of its design to sustained high-speed access to memory, including over one million 64-bit words of semiconductor memory and a cycle time that was <b>one-fifth</b> that <b>of</b> the ASC (12.5 ns). Although the ASC was in some ways a more expandable design, in the supercomputer world outright speed wins, and the Cray-1 was simply much faster. ASC sales ended almost overnight, and although an upgraded ASC had been designed with a cycle time <b>one-fifth</b> that <b>of</b> the original, Texas Instruments decided to exit the market entirely.|$|R
5|$|The Patries {{design as}} a {{semi-rigid}} airship {{required that the}} pressure of both the lifting gas in the gas-bag and {{the air in the}} ballonet be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of , at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately <b>one-fifth</b> <b>of</b> the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet to take up the volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved.|$|E
5|$|The flag {{proportions}} are not fixed, but 3:5 is {{most commonly}} used, {{as with other}} flags of {{the countries of the}} United Kingdom. (Flag manufacturers themselves may adopt alternative ratios, including 1:2 or 2:3). Lord Lyon King of Arms states that 5:4 is suitable. The ratio of the width of the bars of the saltire in relation to the width of the field is specified in heraldry in relation to shield width rather than flag width. However, this ratio, though not rigid, is specified as one-third to <b>one-fifth</b> <b>of</b> the width of the field.|$|E
5|$|The {{high winds}} {{produced}} by Emily caused considerable impact in Quintana Roo, {{especially in the}} municipality of Solidaridad, leaving nearly 200,000 residences without power. In terms of structural damage, 851 homes were impacted in varying degrees. Roughly 13,345acres (5,400hectares) of forests and agricultural land was affected by the storm; some swathes of trees experienced defoliation. The most substantial losses associated with the hurricane stemmed from the tourism industry, with hotels experiencing 947million pesos ($88.7million) worth of damage. More than 12,500 rooms, nearly <b>one-fifth</b> <b>of</b> the state's available hotel infrastructure, sustained damage. Overall, damage in the state reached 1.11billion pesos ($104.3million).|$|E
