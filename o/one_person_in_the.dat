5|$|An {{estimated}} 646people {{were inside}} the building when the bomb exploded. By {{the end of the}} day, 14 adults and 6 children were confirmed dead, and over 100 injured. The toll eventually reached 168confirmed dead, not including an unmatched left leg that could have belonged to an unidentified 169th victim or could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg. Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Athenian Building, one woman in a parking lot across the street, a man and woman in the Oklahoma Water Resources building, and a rescue worker struck on the head by debris.|$|E
5|$|China has {{installed}} a grassroots network of officials throughout Xinjiang, its predominantly Muslim north-west frontier region, to address social risks and spot {{early signs of}} unrest: Hundreds of cadres have been transferred from southern Xinjiang, the region’s poorest area, into socially unstable neighbourhoods of Ürümqi; a policy has been implemented where if all family members are unemployed, the government arranges for <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> household to get a job,; official announcements are calling upon university students to register for those payouts. The areas around slums are being redeveloped to reduce social risks, opening way to new apartment blocks. However, independent observers believe that fundamental inequalities need to be addressed, and the mindset must change {{for there to be}} any success; Ilham Tohti warned that the new policy could attract more Han immigration, and further alienate the Uyghur population.|$|E
5|$|Offshore the Arabian Peninsula, the cyclone {{produced}} rough {{waves that}} disabled an oil tanker; {{the crew was}} rescued by the Omani Coast Guard after being stranded for a few days. A fishing boat was damaged after being washed ashore near Ras Madrakah, killing <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crew of nine. Near where the storm moved ashore, the storm's strong winds heavily damaged the village of Ras Madrakah. Considered the worst storm in memory, the cyclone wrecked workshops and buildings, including damaging {{the roof of the}} desalination plant, leaving residents without water for several days. Strong winds of over 93km/h (58mph) knocked down 20trees in Rima that were planted to provide shade for government buildings. Across the storm's track through Oman, the rains replenished water levels in aquifers, while also washing out roads and isolating villages. This lack of transportation prevented prompt repair work. The Jiddat al-Harasis desert was flooded for over a month due to the storm, killing two people due to drowning in Al-Ghubra. The floods provided grazing for the endangered oryx population, although many livestock were killed. Three airports in the country were closed due to floods up to four days.|$|E

25|$|To reduce {{noise from}} the street, Wright {{eliminated}} street level windows in the temple. Instead, natural light comes from stained glass windows in the roof and clerestories along the upper walls. Because {{the members of the}} parish {{would not be able to}} look outside, Unity Temple's stained glass was designed with green, yellow, and brown tones in order to evoke the colors of nature. The main floor of the temple is accessed via a lower floor (which has seating space), and the room also has two balconies for the seating of the congregation. These varying seating levels allowed the architect to design a building to fit the size of the congregation, but efficiently: no <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> congregation is more than 40 feet from the pulpit. Wright also designed the building with very good acoustics.|$|E

25|$|Trujillo {{began to}} {{interfere}} {{more in the}} domestic affairs of neighboring countries. He expressed great contempt for Venezuela's president Rómulo Betancourt. An established and outspoken opponent of Trujillo, Betancourt associated with Dominicans who had plotted against the dictator. Trujillo developed an obsessive personal hatred of Betancourt and supported numerous plots by Venezuelan exiles to overthrow him. This pattern of intervention led the Venezuelan government to take its case against Trujillo to the Organization of American States (OAS). This infuriated Trujillo, who ordered his agents to plant a bomb in Betancourt's car. On 24 June 1960, while Betancourt was driving {{through the streets of}} Caracas, Venezuela, during the annual Army Day parade, a powerful bomb exploded in his motorcade. The bomb had been placed in a green Oldsmobile parked near the parade route and contained 65 kilos of TNT. The blast exploded right under the car carrying Betancourt and his party. The car was sent flying across the street. <b>One</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> auto was killed, and Betancourt suffered severe burns to his hands.|$|E
25|$|The branch Forcade de Biaix and {{a little}} known, but closely related, branch Forcade de Baure, both also claimed a common lineage from {{ancestors}} in Orthez in the late 17th century, however, the authors of early books {{on the topic of}} genealogies of noble families are silent about the ancestry of the Forcade-Biaix branch's founder, Noble Jean de Forcade, Seigneur de Biaix. These same early books name only <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Forcade-Baure branch, Noble Pierre de Forcade, Seigneur de Baure. Recent 21st century research, however, demonstrates that Jean de Forcade, Seigneur de Biaix, Fermier des monnaies de Béarn et (Lower) Navarre (Lessee of the Mints of Béarn and (Lower) Navarre), was the grandson of Pierre de Forcade, lawyer, Garde en la monnaie de Pau (1622–36), a resident of Boeil in 1624. Pierre de Forcade, Seigneur de Baure was his eldest son. The elder Pierre was also the son of the same Noble Jean de Forcade aka Jean de Laforcade, Seigneur de La Fitte-Juson, who was stripped of his nobility {{in the first half of}} the 17th century, for the dérogeance of having acquired some farms in the Pays de Marsan.|$|E

500|$|The {{advanced}} Chakra Nature Transformation {{is a type}} of kekkei genkai {{which allows}} the users to manipulate elements other than the five basic chakra nature: fire, water, wind, lightning, and earth. The combination is usually achieved through mixing two (or three in the case of kekkei tōta) separate elements to create an entirely new one; thus the users are able to use the elements that composed the advanced element in addition to the kekkei genkai (such as Yamato being able to use water and earth in addition to the wood). Due to the nature of kekkei genkai, ninja with no blood limit required to use the elements are unable to use them even when they had mastered the basic components of the element. Some advanced elements may be unique to <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clan, the most notable being the Wood Style, which is only present in Hashirama Senju.
