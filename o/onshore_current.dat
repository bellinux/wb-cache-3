40|$|To-date the {{upwelling}} {{process and}} the associated forcing mechanism over the continental shelf of the Northern South China Sea (NSCS) remain unclear. Therefore a three-dimensional Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS), was used to conduct a process-orientated investigation {{in order to better}} understand the intrinsic upwelling dynamics in the NSCS. The model uses an orthogonal curvilinear grid with a horizontal resolution of about 3 km and it has 30 terrain-following vertical levels. A physical-sensible forced open boundary condition is implemented, which divides total velocity into global and local solutions. The local solution is provided by a two-dimensional submodel and the global solution is obtained from a radiation condition. Forced with idealized upwelling favorable winds, the model simulates the observed upwelling characteristics in the NSCS well. In particular, {{it was found that the}} upwelling over the shelf of NSCS has a strong alongshore variation with intensified upwelling occurring off Shantou where the shelf extends offshore abruptly and in the lee of coastal promontories. Strong upwelling was also found in the waters south of Hainan Island where wind-induced Ekman transport is strong. Dynamic analysis indicates that the strength of the onshore transport in the upwelling circulation is highly controlled by the interaction between the coastal upwelling jet and the local shelf topography. The strong <b>onshore</b> <b>current</b> represented by a positive Coriolis force is balanced by a negative pressure gradient force induced at the lee of coastal promontories or sharply widened shelf. Relatively strong upwelling also occurs where the shelf slope is steep such as Daya Bay - Red Sea Gulf. The steep continental slope with offshore tongue-shaped bottom isobaths tends to enhance the <b>onshore</b> <b>current</b> at depth. Upwelled water at the sea surface is advected offshore by the intensified upwelling jet at the same location. Cold and nutrient-rich water is more likely to be found east of Hong Kong due to stronger upwelling over the steep slope. The relatively flat bottom at the mid-shelf around Shantou, where the shelf extends offshore abruptly, acts as a platform to allow upwelled water to be retained at the mid-shelf. The upward current in the south of the Taiwan Shoals, forced by the upwelling favorable wind, is not strong enough to push the bottom water to the sea surface, suggesting that the observed dense water is likely formed by a force other than local wind stress. The effects of fresh water discharge from the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) on the upwelling circulation were investigated. It was found that the fresh water plume is formed in the central part of the shelf and advected towards the eastern part of the shelf by the upwelling jet. The river discharge tends to strengthen onshore currents in the interior of the water column over the inner shelf. A simulation forced with observed upwelling favorable winds reveal that the upwelling intensity at the near shore location was sensitive to the orientation and strength of the local wind stress...|$|E

First, the model is driven by constant wind forcing, then qualitative and quantitative estimations of the dynamics of the basin are made reproducing the strong Bora event of the 25 June 2002. Numerical results show good agreement with in situ measurements and remotely sensed images. The relevance of coastal upwelling and its persistence are also assessed. The results prove that mixing and coastal upwelling (both wind-driven) govern the circulation of the basin. When bora starts blowing, buoyant surface water is moved by EKMAN transport offshore inducing a bottom <b>onshore</b> <b>current.</b> Simultaneously, wind driven stirring breaks the initial stable stratification. The surface offshore current generates a sea surface level setup on the northern boundary.

40|$|Many coastal {{activities}} {{are concerned with}} the interaction of coastal sedimentary processes and coastal works, such as the construction of structures for shore protection and stabilization, and beach nourishment. It is important to measure sand properties, sediment moving processes and transport rates, as well as the resulted nearshore morphology to understand the sediment transport mechanism under various wave and current conditions. In this study, we are interested in understanding the sediment transport mechanism, especially the influence of wave-induced boundary layer streaming on sediment transport under combined wave and current conditions in the sheetflow regime. Recently, sediment net transport rate measured through the large wave flume (LWF) experiments presents a more onshore tendency, i. e., a larger onshore net transport, than the result from the small oscillatory flow tunnel (OFT) experiments. Various researchers argue that the wave-induce onshore streaming could be the reason to cause such difference. The objective of this research is to understand the physical features of this phenomenon and answer the question: Does onshore streaming really enhance the onshore sheetflow net sand transport? If so, then, how and how much does it affect the onshore transport? If not, what is the real reason behind? The second is to obtain new insights into the importance of the boundary layer onshore streaming and to understand the transport processes under wave and current conditions. To achieve the objectives and to measure the sediment net transport rate under sheet flow conditions, laboratory experiments were conducted under the combined asymmetric wave-current conditions to quantitatively evaluate the influence from the onshore streaming. The second order Stokes'wave theory with a velocity asymmetric index of 0. 57 was applied for wave generation with three well-sorted sands with medium sand size of D 50 = 0. 3 mm (coarse), 0. 16 mm (fine) and 0. 13 mm (very fine). For fine sand without <b>onshore</b> <b>current,</b> the net transport increases with increasing velocity, and it is directed to the onshore. However, for larger velocity case, the net transport rate decreases and the direction also changes to the offshore. As for the very fine sand, the net transport rate decreases and is directed to the offshore even for a small velocity case. Considering the coarse sand, the net transport is in the onshore direction. To understand the effect of onshore streaming, a small current Uc of 10 cm/s and 20 cm/s was generated in the onshore direction. Experiment results for small current 10 cm/s indicate the magnitude offshore net transport rate reduces and the direction is to the offshore for the very fine sand and fine sand with large velocity case. When increasing the small current value to 20 cm/s, the net transport rate of fine and very fine sand increases and changes to onshore direction with small velocity case. But for large velocity case, even though the magnitude of offshore net rate reduces, the direction is still directed to offshore with fine sand case. Taking into account the net transport rate measured under the combined wave and current cases, the onshore net transport for coarse sand continuously increases. It is noted that the tendency of increasing of net transport rate is not observed in fine grains when the velocity becomes increases without the contribution of current. In case of the contribution of small onshore streaming, although the magnitude of offshore net transport rate of fine and very fine sand reduces, it still directs to offshore under large velocity case. It indicates that the onshore streaming, indeed, enhances offshore net transport rate for fine sand and very fine sand with large velocity. On the other hand, the small onshore streaming may be partly important for the case of fine sand under small velocity condition. Sediment particle velocity within the sand-laden sheetflow layer was measured by means of a PIV technique. By averaging the sediment particle velocity over one wave period, the mean flow velocity was also evaluated. From the mean velocity profile under pure wave conditions, it is found that, in case of the coarse sand, an onshore streaming is detected in the pick-up layer and leads to offshore in the upper sheet-flow layer. Nevertheless, in case of fine sand, the profiles show a negative streaming due to the strong phase-lag effect. The positive near-bed streaming is not observed. The large phase-lag can induce a negative (offshore) net transport. Thus, the phase-lag effect seems {{to play an important role}} for the sediment sheetflow transport in the OFT test. For coarse sand under combined wave and current conditions, a very small <b>onshore</b> <b>current</b> exists in the pick-up layer (z< 0 mm) and the mean flow velocity leads to onshore direction in the sheet flow layer. In the suspension layer, when the elevation is higher than 15 mm, the mean flow changes its direction from onshore to offshore. In the case of fine sand, the time-averaged velocity indicates the streaming is positive in the pick-up layer as well as in the sheet flow layer. After that, the velocity decreases for increasing the depth (z) mm. Clearly, the additional <b>onshore</b> <b>current</b> in the tunnel does contribute to more onshore sediment transport. Besides that, it is also confirmed that the phase-lag effect plays an important role in the sediment transport under the sheetflow conditions, especially for the fine sand case with large velocity case as it produces offshore net transport rate. Here also, the streaming profiles are very sensitive to sand size. Furthermore, the measured net transport rates are compared with the results from surface wave under same flow conditions. For very fine and fine sand with onshore streaming, the sediment rate under oscillatory flow tunnel can predict about 75 % of net rates under surface wave with small velocity case. Now, the new experiments indicated the difference of sediment rate between these was about 1. 5 times for fine sand with onshore streaming. In addition, the results of coarse sand with streaming produce larger onshore net sediment rate compared to surface wave. It means the contribution of streaming is quite large enough to enhance the more onshore net transport rate for the coarse sand. As a result, the streaming effect is very dependent on sand size. The maximum erosion depth was estimated from the temporal change of the measured erosion depth. A linear relationship was found between the relative maximum erosion depth δem/D and the maximum Shields parameter, θm. The erosion depth under crest is larger than under trough for fine sand and coarse sand under combined wave and current conditions. The influence of wave period and velocity on erosion depth was also measured for two types of sand. And then, in order to know how much the distribution of small onshore streaming enhanced the larger net rate, the results of net transport rate with onshore streaming are compared with SANTOSS model which include surface wave effects. In this study, SANTOSS model was also considered as streaming-related model including the streaming effect by analytically to represent the surface wave phenomenon. The comparison results showed that although the results of fine and coarse sand with onshore streaming overestimated compared to the results of streaming-related model, it lies with a factor of two differences. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 09 - 27; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科社会基盤学専...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDiel {{vertical}} migration (DVM) {{is a common}} zooplankton behavior in which organisms reside in surface or near-surface waters at night and at deeper depths during the day. In many upwelling regions, DVM reduces the transport of organisms away from the region. It is unclear, however, what role DVM plays in recruitment (the arrival of larvae or juveniles to locations where they will become reproducing adults) to upwelling regions. In this study, we estimate the influence of DVM on zooplankton transport, the level of recruitment of locally produced propagules (self-recruitment), and sources of recruits in the upwelling region near Monterey Bay, California, by simulating the trajectories of fixed-depth and vertically migrating organisms with a drifter-tracking algorithm driven by climatological velocity fields from a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. Our simulations suggest that DVM into subsurface poleward and <b>onshore</b> <b>currents</b> during the day does not fully compensate for equatorward and offshore transport in the surface Ekman layer at night and does not retain zooplankton in the Monterey Bay region. Our simulations also suggest that DVM decreases the ability of zooplankton {{to return to the}} region after being transported away and shifts source regions for recruits closer to the bay. While DVM does not appear to substantially increase the potential for self-recruitment to the region, this study indicates that other mechanisms, such as transport during non-upwelling periods, continuous transport below the surface, increases in mean transport depth over time, or seasonal changes in hydrography, may still enable relatively high levels of self-recruitment to this highly advective region...|$|R

Minimum buoyancy periods range from 4. 8 to 6 min, with the maximum density gradient occurring at 50 to 60 m depth in summer and deepening to approximately 150 to 200 m in winter. The bottom slope angle around all of Moorea is super-critical relative to the vertical stratification angle suggesting that energy propagating into shallow water is {{only a portion of}} total incident internal wave energy. Vertical gradient Richardson numbers indicate dominance by density stability relative to current shear with relatively limited diapycnal mixing. Coherence and lagged cross-correlation of semi-diurnal temperature variation indicate complex patterns of inter-site arrival of internal waves and no clear coherence or lagged correlation relationships among island sides. Semi-diurnal and high frequency internal wave packets likely arrive on Moorea from a combination of local and distant sources and may have important impacts for nutrient and particle fluxes in deep reef environments. © 2012 American Geophysical Union.

We investigated larval transport mechanisms at a ripchanneled beach. Because tracking larvae {{in the surf}} zone is infeasible, we used a three-dimensional biophysical model to simulate the processes. The coupled model consists of a physical module for currents and waves, and a biological module for adding larval traits and behaviors as well as Stokes drift to Lagrangian particles. Model calculations were performed with and without onshore wind forcing. Without wind, wave-driven onshore streaming occurs in the bottom boundary layer outside the surf zone. With <b>onshore</b> wind, <b>onshore</b> <b>currents</b> occur near the surface. In the surf zone, offshore-directed rip currents and compensating onshore-directed currents over shoals are formed in both no-wind and wind cases. In the biological module, neutral, negative, and positive buoyant particles were released offshore. Additionally, particles either sank {{in the presence of}} turbulence or not. Two scenarios achieved successful onshore migration: Negatively buoyant larvae without wind forcing sink in the turbulent bottom boundary layer and are carried onshore by streaming; positively buoyant larvae drift toward shore in wind-driven surface currents to the surf zone, then sink in the turbulent surf zone and remain near the bottom while transported shoreward. In both cases, the larval concentration is highest in the rip channel, consistent with field data. This successful result is only obtained if turbulence-dependent sinking behavior and Stokes drift are included in the transport of larvae.

In this study, we compare the results of different approaches which deal with the Early Palaeogene {{evolution of}} the Egyptian shelf, including new data from the Galala platform. Microfacies analyses along a platform to basin transect reveal a sedimentological response to a massive tectonic uplift along the Syrian Arc-Fold Belt in the Early Eocene. This uplift triggered the restriction of the Egyptian shelf by modulating and weakening Tethyan <b>onshore</b> <b>currents</b> from the North. The increasing deposition of quartz and proliferating gastropods, green algae and radiolaria, which indicate elevated nutrient levels, reflect an intensified eutrophication of shallow-marine platforms and deeper-marine shelf environments. Strongly depleted carbon isotope ratios in the sediments of the Galala succession strongly suggest the presence of restricted conditions throughout the Early Eocene. We assume that a strong climatic divergence with arid conditions on the shelf and humid conditions at the African hinterland triggered intensified chemical weathering at the Nubian-Arabian Craton. The enhanced riverine transport of terrestrial organic material to the North African shelf caused the increased availability of trophic resources and a strong negative shift of carbon isotope ratios between NP 10 and NP 14 a. The recovery to open ocean conditions is linked to the termination of tectonic uplift along the Syrian Arc-Fold Belt in the latest Early Eocene and to stronger ocean currents, caused by increasing latitudinal temperature gradients. Additionally, the post-PETM carbon isotope evolution at the Galala platform indicates at least two further negative carbon isotope excursions, which reflect hyperthermal events on a global scale. The associated reorganization of shallow-marine assemblages as described for example for the Larger Foraminifera Turnover at the PETM boundary event is, however, missing.

Warm bore fronts had concentrating currents resulting from high-frequency internal motions and from a larger twoway flow; the two-way flow featured surface <b>currents</b> <b>onshore</b> and bottom <b>currents</b> offshore. A sharp thermocline depression and high-frequency, large-amplitude internal motions followed {{the leading edge of the}} bore, with downwelling currents on the trailing side of the crest of the nonlinear internal waves and upwelling currents in front of the crest.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The diurnal-period fluctuations of winds and surface currents are analyzed for September 1992 {{in and around}} Monterey Bay. Wind records are compared for three coastal stations and two mooring sites. Remotely-sensed surface current observations from two CODAR (HF radar) sites are used to explore the ocean's response to diurnal-period forcing. An average diurnal cycle is formed at each wind station and at all CODAR bins. The earliest sea breeze response is seen at the coastal wind stations where morning winds accelerate toward the coastal mountain ranges. A few hours later, the coastal winds accelerate to the southeast down the Salinas Valley. Offshore afternoon winds rotate from their normal alongshore orientation to also become aligned with the valley. The CODAR-derived surface currents respond in less than the two-hour sampling rate to {{the onset of the}} diurnal <b>onshore</b> winds. <b>Currents</b> accelerate {{in the direction of the}} Salinas Valley.

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} the ecology of marine larvae suggest that {{retention}} near coastal areas and self-recruitment are probably much more common than previously thought. In light of this, the advective potential of pelagic stages can be partially determined by the timing of propagule release. We sampled the upper-shore levels of a subtropical coastline in southeastern Brazil to examine the temporal patterns of propagule release for the common barnacle Chthamalus bisinuatus and the periwinkle Nodilittorina lineolata. The release timing in both species was very consistent between sites a few kilometers apart. Barnacles released nauplii in a rhythmic pattern, mostly coinciding with neap tides, when the speed of tidal currents was lowest. There was no variation in propagule release in relation to diel or flood-ebb tidal cycles. Periwinkles released propagules in a very irregular pattern, which remarkably matched a time series of wave heights. Egg capsules were released during periods of rough seas, when <b>onshore</b> surface <b>currents</b> were expected to prevail. Eggs were released mostly during ebb tides, {{and there was no}} diel variation. Propagule release rhythms are usually viewed as a means to ensure fast offshore advection, thus avoiding presumed hazardous conditions for larvae. However, propagule release strategies in these upper-shore species would more likely contribute to the retention of offspring close to parental stocks.

On the 1 st January 2013 the IMO are expected to enforce mandatory measures to reduce shipping carbon emissions and these measures will directly and indirectly affect the daily operations of seafarers, onshore performance staff, and managerial personnel with influence over operational procedures.

40|$|In wave flumes an <b>onshore</b> {{boundary}} layer <b>current</b> is present {{that is not}} present in oscillating flow tunnels. We investigate numerically the hypothesis that this streaming explains the measured increase of onshore directed sediment transport in flumes over tunnels. In the formulation and validation of the model special {{attention has been given}} to the wave-generated net current profile. From model experiments we conclude that the additional current indeed contributes to onshore transport, but can not be the full explanation of the measured differences in transport rates. Other contributing mechanisms are the amplification/reduction of the fall velocity by vertical sediment advection (only relevant for fine grains) and the amplification/reduction of the concentration at maximum onshore/offshore velocity by intra-wave gradients in horizontal sediment flux. The latter contributes, for the investigated cases, to onshore transport with comparable order as the {{boundary layer}} current. These conclusions are relevant for further development of parameterizations of wave-induced sediment transport for morphodynamic models...|$|R
40|$|The {{northern}} {{sector of}} Waihi Beach {{is an example}} of chronic erosive tendency. The sediment deficit along the area of beach fronting the seawall means that there is often no beach at high tide. This existing situation, and the various remedial options suggested, has created an emotive issue for beach residents. Accordingly, the current study was undertaken to identify and evaluate the fundamental coastal processes impacting upon the erosion at northern Waihi Beach. Methods used to investigate this problem included: beach profiling and shallow water hydrographic surveying; mapping of sediments and the distribution of bedforms on the inner shelf using side-scan sonar, identification of nearshore sediment transport pathways from sediment textural analyses; collection and analysis of nearshore wave and current data; and numerical modelling of wave refraction and sediment transport processes. A side-scan sonar survey, ground-truthed by surficial sediment analyses and underwater video and diver observations, indicated that the shallow inshore zone is characterised by a relatively featureless seabed dominated by fine sands. Large shore-normal sand ridges (η= 0. 4 - 2. 5 m, λ= 300 - 1400), with crests oriented northeast to southwest were identified between 15 - 30 m water depth offshore northern Waihi Beach. These very pronounced features consist of coarse megarippled (η≈ 0. 12 m, λ≈ 1 m) sediment. Sediment textural analyses revealed that offshore sediments vary from fine to coarse sand, showing a seaward-coarsening progression. Beach sediments consist of predominantly fine sands, with a slight inferred fining in grain size that occurs towards the northern end of the beach. This is possibly a result of lower wave energy when subject to swell and sea waves from the north, due to sheltering in the lee of Rapitiotio Point. 80 days of wave and current data were collected offshore northern Waihi Beach, during two separate deployments in Nov/Dec 2007 and May/June 2008. The summer deployment was characterised by waves from a northeast-east origin (Hs= 1. 09 m; Ts= 7. 13 s). Similar conditions were exhibited during the winter deployment (Hs= 0. 95 m; Ts= 6. 79 s). Observed relationships between wind direction and near-bed current direction, combined with calculated sediment entrainment rates, enabled predictions of the frequency of shoreward sediment transport by bottom currents to be made. <b>Onshore</b> <b>currents,</b> associated with winds from the southwest, prevailed during the deployment period. However, observed current velocities alone were generally incapable of inducing sediment motion. Analysis suggests that wave properties are likely to govern the frequency of sediment transport in the nearshore, as their presence is required to lift sediment into suspension for dispersal by ambient background <b>currents.</b> <b>Onshore</b> movement of sediment was estimated to be ~ 11, 800 m 3 /year or 2. 6 m 3 /m. Monochromatic wave statistics measured during the field study were used to calibrate a numerical wave refraction model. The wave refraction influence of Mayor Island was found to be the major feature influencing the distribution of wave energy along the shoreline, which is likely to contribute to localised accelerated beach erosion and dune setback. Wave energy focusing at northern Waihi Beach is maximised by swell waves, resulting in greater wave heights along eroding sectors of the beach. Potential sediment transport rates were investigated. Results suggest the littoral drift direction was bi-directional at northern Waihi Beach, although net littoral drift was southeasterly during the study period. An estimated net loss of 46, 200 m 3 /year or 10. 3 m 3 /m was predicted for northern Waihi Beach during the present study. Longer-term drift patterns were examined using a five year record of wave data collected offshore Pukehina by Environment Bay or Plenty from 2003 - 2008. Similar patterns but with lower magnitudes of sediment transport were obtained, with net annual drift rates estimated to range from 1, 300 - 58, 000 m 3 /year. A conceptual model of nearshore sediment dynamics is proposed for Waihi Beach to identify the major factors contributing to long-term erosion in the northern sector. Approximately 115, 000 m 3 of sediment was estimated to be moving within the defined northern Waihi Beach littoral cell during the study period. The derived sediment budget produced a net deficit of sediment of approximately 36, 000 m 3 /year or - 8 m 3 /year during the year commencing November 2007. The net southeasterly littoral drift was determined the major contributor to the net erosion rate during the study period, with alongshore transport rates exceeding available supply to the beach from diabathic movement of sediment onshore. Several aspects of the erosion problem at northern Waihi Beach are recommended to be researched further to identify what coastal management options are required...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{studies of}} the tides in the South China Sea (SCS) and circulations in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) and {{adjacent}} shelf are carried out by developing a numerical modeling system that includes a tidal circulation model in the SCS basin, a conceptual and a realistic three-dimensional coupled estuary-shelf circulation models forced by wind stress, tides, and river discharge around the PRE. The high resolution tidal model utilizes a physically sensible domain and assimilates Topex/Poseidon (T/P) data through an efficient generalized inverse scheme. The coupled estuary-shelf modeling is a physically novel study that investigates the interactive roles of the wind, tide and buoyancy forcing and dynamic processes of buoyant plume, estuarine circulation and shelf circulations in the PRE region. Tidal simulation in the SCS well simulates the observed feature and provides tidal forcing for the subsequent coupled estuarine-shelf circulation models around the PRE, and investigates the dynamics and energy of tides in a semi-enclosed sea. The study, for the first time, reveals the amplified K 1 tide in the SCS basin {{as a result of}} the Helmholtz resonance. Analysis of tidal energy shows that the energy dissipates mostly in the LS and strong dissipation of M 2 tide also occurs in the Taiwan Strait (TS). The work rate of the tidal generating force in the SCS basin is negative for M 2 and positive for K 1. The different responses of the M 2 and K 1 tides in the SCS are largely controlled by the intruding directions of the tides from the Pacific, the tidal frequency, the wavelengths, the local geometry and the bottom topography. A conceptual coupled estuary-shelf model that utilizes representative, but idealized forcing and topography is developed to better identify the fundamental but extremely complex physical processes in a simple but physically well-defined system. Results show that a buoyancy-driven anti-cyclonic eddy is developed inside the idealized PRE under both the gravitational and Coriolis effects, but dissolved by additional tide or wind forcing. The shape and spreading speed of the Pearl River plume are greatly modified by the wind and tidal forcing, in which, the thickness of the plume is increased and the propagation speed is retarded by strong tidal mixing in the estuary, while the plume is narrowed and accelerated by the wind-driven coastal currents over the shelf. The upwelling/downwelling coastal jet intrudes into the estuary with different current patterns and these shelf processes largely influence the estuarine circulation. Forced by observed time-dependent wind, buoyancy, and tidal forcing, the direct simulation in the coupled estuarine-shelf model in the PRE adopts high spatial resolution that better resolves the realistic topography and coastal geometry. With the implementations of suitable numerical schemes and physically sensible open boundary conditions, circulation and related dynamics resulting from the interactions between the topography and multi-forcing processes are explored. It is found that the patterns of the coastal upwelling currents are largely controlled by the topography and greatly modified by the tide and buoyancy forcing over the shelf, and the coastal bays and estuaries with wide entrance are favorable for the intrusion of the upwelling coastal jets. Tidal residual currents and tide-induced redistribution of the sea surface pressure gradient field strengthen/weaken the coastal upwelling jet and bottom <b>onshore</b> <b>currents</b> on the eastern/western shelf. The buoyant plume enhances the eastward and southward motion of the surface upwelling currents as a result of thinned surface Ekman layer and formation of pressure gradient between the plume and ambient sea water. Inside the PRE, the circulation has little response to the wind forcing in the upper part, but is largely influenced by the intrusion of the time-dependent coastal circulation. Analysis of the plume and current features in spring-neap cycle reveals that the variable competition of the tide and buoyancy forcing determines the circulation around the entrance of the PRE...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages 118 - 131. Temporal {{and spatial}} {{changes in the}} {{abundance}} and distribution of anchovy and sardine eggs and larvae in the southern Benguela ecosystem were investigated during 14 cruises over 2 consecutive summer upwelling seasons {{as part of the}} South African Sardine and Anchovy Recruitment programme (SA-SARP). Cruises were conducted each month between August 1993 and March 1994 (SARP I) and September 1994 and March 1995 (SARP II). Anchovy spawning was largely confined to the western Agulhas Bank, reaching a definite peak during spring (October and November). Sardine ·spawning extended up the west coast ·duiing·periods when anchovy spawning reached a peak on the western Agulhas Bank. However, sardine eggs were dense on the western Agulhas Bank during peak spawning activity which appears to be bimodal, reaching a peak in the early spring (August/September) and again in late summer (February). · Although the midshelf region on the W AB appeared to be the centre of both anchovy and ·sardine spawning in the southern Benguela ecosystem, these data suggest that anchovy and sardine spawning activity may be both spatially, and temporally separated to some extent. Mean anchovy egg densities on the W AB decreased by 53 % from 1993 / 94 to 1994 / 95 while a slight increase in mean sardine egg density (16 %) over the entire region was observed from one season to the next. Lloyd's Patchiness Index was used to investigate the distribution patterns of spawning products and the results showed that the distribution of both anchovy and sardine eggs and larvae was extremely patchy, but that the eggs of both species were more patchy than their larvae. Anchovy eggs were most abundant at sea surface temperatures ranging from 16 - 20 °C. Changes in the extent of 16 -l 9 °C water (as a measure of spawning habitat) and the abundance of large copepods within this region reflect intra-annual changes in the intensity of anchovy spawning activity. Sardine eggs were found predominantly in water of between 14. 5 - 21. 5 °C. The seasonal intensity of sardine spawning appears to vary independently of the area of 16 - 19 °C water, but· a positive correlation between the spawning activity of sardine and the monthly chlorophyll a concentrations on the W AB suggests that spawning may be related to their feeding conditions. A comparison of egg and larval distributions with current features from selected months during SARP supports previous studies which indicate that the frontal jet {{plays an important role in}} the transport of the early life history stages of anchovy and sardine but that the position of such transport can vary between the 200 m and 500 m isobaths. Areas of possible egg loss included the W AB, the offshore currents which can develop west of the Cape Peninsula and the outer branch of the jet off Cape Columbine. However, there is evidence that <b>onshore</b> <b>currents</b> further north may transport the eggs back to the region of the jet. The monthly estimates of anchovy egg mortality were highly variable and imprecise and these results were probably due to a combination of small sample sizes and reduced egg abundances, usually encountered at the start and end of the anchovy spawning season. The annual estimates of anchovy egg mortality during November between 1984 and 1994 were positively correlated with the patchiness of anchovy eggs during the same cruises. The effect of cannibalism in areas where eggs are particularly dense was invoked as a possible explanation for this result. It was concluded that the spawning behaviour of anchovy and sardine may be influenced by sea surface temperatures, feeding conditions for adult fish and advective processes in the southern Benguela ecosystem and these factors were discussed in terms of their possible impact on recruitment...|$|R

40|$|Buoyancy {{acting on}} plankton, i. e. the {{difference}} in specific gravity between plankton and the ambient water, {{is a function of}} salinity and temperature. From specific gravity measurements of marine fish eggs salinity appears to be the only determinant of the buoyancy indicating that the thermal expansions of the fish egg and the ambient seawater are equal. We analyze the mechanisms behind thermal expansion in fish eggs in order to determine to what extent it can be justified to neglect the effects of temperature on buoyancy. Our results confirm the earlier assumptions that salinity is the basic determinant on buoyancy in marine fish eggs that, in turn, influence the vertical distributions and, consequently, the dispersal of fish eggs from the spawning areas. Fish populations have adapted accordingly by producing egg specific gravities that tune the egg buoyancy to create specific vertical distributions for each local population. A wide variety of buoyancy adaptations are found among fish populations. The ambient physical conditions at the spawning sites form a basic constraint for adaptation. In coastal regions where salinity increases with depth, and where the major fraction of the fish stocks spawns, pelagic and mesopelagic egg distributions dominate. However, in the larger part of worlds' oceans salinity decreases with depth resulting in different egg distributions. Here, the principles of vertical distributions of fish eggs in the world oceans are presented in an overarching framework presenting the basic differences between regions, mainly coastal, where salinity increases with depth and the major part of the world oceans where salinity decreases with depth. We show that under these latter conditions, steady-state vertical distribution of mesopelagic fish eggs cannot exist as it does in most coastal regions. In fact, a critical spawning depth must exist where spawning below this depth threshold results in eggs sinking out of the water column and become lost for recruitment to the population. An example of adaptation to such conditions is Cape hake spawning above the critical layer in the Northern Benguela upwelling ecosystem. The eggs rise slowly in the <b>onshore</b> subsurface <b>current</b> below the Ekman layer, hence being advected inshore where the hatched larvae concentrate with optimal feeding conditions...|$|R
