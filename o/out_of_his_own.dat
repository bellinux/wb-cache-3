5|$|In September 2009, Tharoor and S. M. Krishna {{were accused}} of staying in luxurious 5-star hotels. Tharoor {{said it was because}} of the delayed {{readiness}} of his official residence and that he had paid <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> pocket for the accommodation. Later, on Pranab Mukherjee's request, Tharoor and Krishna moved out of the hotels.|$|E
5|$|In 1848 Anderssen drew a {{match with}} the {{professional}} player Daniel Harrwitz. On {{the basis of}} this match and his general chess reputation, he was invited to represent German chess at the first international chess tournament, to be held in London in 1851. Anderssen was reluctant to accept the invitation, as he was deterred by the travel costs. However the tournament's principal organizer, Howard Staunton, offered to pay Anderssen's travel expenses <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> pocket if necessary, should Anderssen fail to win a tournament prize. Anderssen accepted this generous offer.|$|E
5|$|Spencer W. Kimball {{suggested}} that Arrington write a serious biography of Brigham Young, and Arrington paid assistants {{for the project}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> pocket, possibly to insulate it from donor influences. Arrington wrote the in-depth biography with help from many of his associates at the History Division. One of Arrington's biographers, Gary Topping, praised the research in Brigham Young: American Moses, but criticized its lack of psychological depth, missing the opportunity to re-examine the Mountain Meadows massacre and how Young's wives were treated.|$|E

5|$|The {{dimensions}} of Christian meditation develop from God's having completed his self-revelation in two directions: Speaking <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> and speaking as a man, through his Son, disclosing {{the depths of}} man.... And this meditation can take place only where the revealing man, God's Son, Jesus Christ, reveals God as his Father: in the Holy Spirit of God, so we may join in probing God's depths, which only God's Spirit probes.|$|E
5|$|During a cold open scene, Ron (Nick Offerman) horrifies {{the entire}} parks {{department}} by apparently pulling an aching tooth <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> {{mouth with a}} pair of pliers. He later admits it was a prank, as a dentist had removed the tooth the previous day. Later, Andy (Chris Pratt) and April (Aubrey Plaza) invite everyone to a dinner party at the home of Andy's band-mate Burly (Andrew Burlinson), where Andy is living. Ben (Adam Scott) tells Leslie (Amy Poehler) that his boss in Indianapolis wants him back on the road, but he has also been offered a job to work under Chris (Rob Lowe) in Pawnee. Although Leslie wants Ben to stay, she is hesitant to say so outright, disappointing him and leaving him conflicted over which job to take.|$|E
5|$|In October 1675 the Swedish fleet under Gustaf Otto Stenbock put to sea, but sailed {{no further}} than Stora Karlsö off Gotland before it had to turn back to Stockholm after less than two weeks, beset by cold and stormy weather, disease, {{and the loss of}} vital equipment. Stenbock, held {{personally}} responsible for the failure by King Charles XI, was forced to pay for the campaign <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> pocket. During the winter of 1675–76 the Swedish fleet was placed under the command of Lorentz Creutz, who attempted to put to sea in January to February 1676, but was iced in by exceptionally cold weather.|$|E

5|$|The {{script for}} Allah jang Palsoe was {{released}} by the Batavia-based publisher Tjiong Koen Bie in mid-1919. This edition included a foreword from the author, four illustrations of recommended stage decor, a number of performance guidelines, and a brief outline {{of the state of}} the theatre among the ethnic Chinese. Kwee Tek Hoay paid for this printing, a run of 1,000 copies, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> pocket and saw large financial losses. The stage play was republished in 2006, using the Perfected Spelling System, as part of the first volume of the Lontar Foundation's anthology of Indonesian stage dramas.|$|E
5|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{requisition}} promised to the legions, Germanicus paid them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> pocket. All 8 legions were given money, {{even if they}} didn't demand it. Both the armies of the Lower and Upper Rhine had returned to order. It seemed prudent to satisfy the armies, but Germanicus took it a step further. In a bid to secure the loyalty of his troops, he led them on a raid against the Marsi, a Germanic people on the upper Ruhr river. Germanicus massacred the villages of the Marsi he encountered and pillaged the surrounding territory. On {{the way back to}} their winter quarters at Castra Vetera, they pushed successfully through the opposing tribes (Bructeri, Tubantes, and Usipetes) between the Marsi and the Rhine.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1991 season, Zerex {{ended their}} {{sponsorship}} of Kulwicki's team. Junior Johnson came calling again, {{looking for a}} driver for his revived second team that had last seen Neil Bonnett behind the wheel in 1986. Kulwicki turned down Johnson's $1 million offer thinking that he had secured a sponsorship deal with Maxwell House Coffee. Johnson then went to Maxwell House himself and obtained the sponsorship for his new car, which Sterling Marlin was hired to drive instead. Kulwicki was forced to begin the season without a sponsor, paying all of the team's expenses <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> pocket. At the opening race of the season, the 1991 Daytona 500, fivecars raced with paint schemes representing different branches of the United States military to show support for the American forces involved in the Gulf War. It was the first use of special paint schemes in NASCAR history. Kulwicki's car {{was sponsored by the}} United States Army in a one-race deal. After running the second and third races of the season in a plain white unsponsored car, Kulwicki's luck finding a sponsor changed for the better at Atlanta Motor Speedway.|$|E

60|$|I {{went out}} arter a bit, {{as far as}} the Clarendon Arms, for a breath of fresh air, and I 'ad just {{finished}} a pint and was wondering whether I ought to 'ave another, when Ted Dennis came in, and my mind was made up. He 'ad been in the Army all 'is life, and, so far, he 'ad never seen anything that 'ad frightened 'im. I've seen him myself take on men twice 'is size just for the love of the thing, and, arter knocking them silly, stand 'em a pint <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>'is</b> <b>own</b> pocket. When I asked 'im whether he was afraid of ghosts he laughed so 'ard that the landlord came {{from the other end of}} the bar to see wot was the matter.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{some rules}} for [...] "concealment" [...] and [...] "hidden initial placement", {{most of the}} game is played where each player can always see what forces the enemy has and {{precisely}} where they are placed, even if <b>out</b> <b>of</b> LOS <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> units. There is little [...] "fog of war." [...] Attempts to redress this - some have suggested using multiple copies of the game and a third party to act as [...] "umpire" [...] - are cumbersome and in some cases book-keeping intensive.|$|R
5|$|Charles Buller Heberden became {{principal}} in 1889. He saw sporting {{as a means}} to the institution of civility than an end in itself; together with Richard Lodge, it was this spirit that dominated his tenure as principal. Academic rigour was reintroduced to the college, and the staff of Brasenose were increasingly successful in maintaining discipline. Until the end of the century, however, the number of students achieving blues outnumbered those attaining firsts. Author John Buchan joined in 1895, a man of this new era– although his work continued to portray Brasenose as its previous muscular stereotype. Heberden was also the first lay principal, although he was personally committed to the church– purchasing an organ for the chapel <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> personal funds. Brasenose was frequently represented as boasting no academic prowess at all. Three of the ten fellows were set aside for non-classicists; a Junior Common Room (JCR) was created in 1887; in 1897 the library was opened up to undergraduates; in 1899, Fellows were granted a right to sabbatical leave. The fellows themselves were increasingly secular; only four of fourteen fellows were clergy.|$|E
5|$|Doggett and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{return to}} Squamash, {{and the two}} ask the sheriff about the murder of an {{unidentified}} transient. Doggett believes that the transient was murdered by Mulder. Doggett and Skinner travel to the cemetery and discover that the grave dug up by the backhoe earlier {{is that of the}} transient. The two find the casket empty, but Doggett notices that the transient tunneled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> coffin. The sheriff arrives with the creature—revealed to be a soul eater, a creature that subsists off human disease—at the Hangemuhl home, where the symbol in blood is on the door again. The hideous creature opens its jaws wide and bites Hangemuhl. Doggett suggests to Skinner that Mulder shot someone to protect Hangemuhl from the man {{who was supposed to be}} in that grave. Meanwhile, deep underground, the creature vomits what appears to be the visceral remains of Marie into a person-shaped mold in the soil.|$|E
25|$|Ginsberg {{continued}} {{to help his}} friends {{as much as he}} could, {{going so far as to}} give money to Herbert Huncke <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> pocket, and housing a broke and drug addicted Harry Smith.|$|E

And surely his face, to anyone who could have seen him being conveyed to Piccadilly, would have suggested a fevered invalid rather than a healthy, middle-aged sculptor in a cab.|$|R

50|$|Instead of {{signalling}} {{the force}} of the ships in sight to the vice-admiral, Watson continued standing towards them under full sail, and was soon <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> fleet. The French ships were much separated; and at 5 pm Northumberland caught up with the stern most, which proved to be the Mars. Mars opened fire upon the Northumberland, which was immediately returned with vigour. But Captain Watson, whose bravery must ever be considered to have ranked higher than <b>his</b> discretion, instead <b>of</b> continuing to engage the Mars, pushed on and endeavoured to close the Content also; maintaining all the time, a running action with the Mars.|$|R

25|$|Rice was {{involved}} in creating a Tiki bar called Tiki Boyd's at the East Coast Bar in Denver, Colorado. Rice decorated the entire establishment <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> pocket due to his fondness of Tiki culture, asking an open tab at the bar in return. Boyd has long expressed a love of Tiki culture, {{in contrast to the}} other elements of his public persona.|$|E

25|$|The Cotton Bowl Classic {{was founded}} in Dallas in 1937 at the Texas State Fair Grounds, when Texas oil {{executive}} J.
