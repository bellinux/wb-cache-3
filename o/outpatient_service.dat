25|$|However, {{in early}} 2011, representatives from school {{employee}} health care trust funds, nursing associations, community health clinics, and others accused Benefis of raising prices 16 percent in 2010 and 30 percent overall since {{removal of the}} COPA agreement. But Benefis also said its costs fell 2 percent in the 2008-2009 period, and another 8 percent in 2010. Benefis denied the accusation, saying the 16 percent figure was overstated because much of that number came from a discontinuation of health care price breaks the health system used to provide. Benefis officials also said their charges for inpatient care were still 2.6 percent below those of its peers, while charges for <b>outpatient</b> <b>service</b> were 29.2 percent lower. Benefis also said it would implement no price increase in 2011, and hoped to reduce costs another 5.2 percent.|$|E

40|$|Enhancement of {{the quality}} of <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> and the {{problems}} of accessibility of services become more and more important part of the health care reform. The importance of increasing the provision of the <b>services</b> in <b>outpatient</b> institutions and developing of <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> of physicians-specialists are the priorities in the plan of re-structuring of health care. Aim of the study. To analyze the provision and tendencies of the secondary and tertiary level <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> to inhabitants of the area Vilnius Territorial Patient Fund in 2003 - 2005. Objectives. To evaluate the provision of the secondary level <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> by specialty, by municipalities and age groups. To analyze the tertiary level <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> by municipalities. To evaluate the changes and tendencies in providing secondary and tertiary level <b>outpatient</b> <b>services.</b> Materials and methods. Analysis was done using the data of health insurance information system SVEIDRA on inhabitants registered to primary health care institutions and <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> provided to inhabitants of the area of Vilnius Territorial Patient Fund in 2003 - 2005. In order to evaluate distribution of services by municipalities, the number of <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> per one inhabitant, registered to primary health care institution, was calculated. Four age groups (0 - 5, 5 - 18, 18 - 65, over 65 years old) were chosen to analyze distribution of services by age groups. The existence of statistically significant differences was tested using t-test. Regression line method was used to assess the tendencies of <b>outpatient</b> <b>services.</b> Statistical analysis is done using “EXEL 2003 “ and “SPSS 11. 0 “. Results. During the investigated period the provision of second level <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> increase by 7 %, tertiary level – by 12. 9 %. The investigations and procedures make 26. 8 % of all provided secondary level <b>outpatient</b> <b>services.</b> Distribution of services was unequal: in 2005 inhabitants of Vilnius city, where the consultants are concentrated, get 1. 97 services per one inhabitant, inhabitants of Alytus city – 0. 98 of services per one inhabitant. One person up to 5 years old living in district municipalities gets twice as less services than children living in Vilnius city. One inhabitant over 65 years old living in Vilnius city gets as much as 1. 5 times services more than inhabitants of other municipalities. The highest rate of use of tertiary <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> is for inhabitants of Trakai district (0. 51 services per inhabitant), the lowest for Alytus city inhabitants (0. 15 services per inhabitant). The ratio of tertiary and secondary <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> differs between the municipalities from 2. 58 to 11. 46 of secondary services per one tertiary service. The differences of <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> provided to inhabitants of Vilnius city and other municipalities will decrease. The provision of tertiary level <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> will increase by 23 %. Conclusions. The provision of <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> to the inhabitants of the area of Vilnius Territorial Patient Fund partly reflects the direction of the health care reform. Inhabitants of Vilnius city get more <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> than inhabitants of other municipalities of the area. The inhabitants using more tertiary level <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> use less secondary level <b>outpatient</b> <b>services.</b> During health care reform the attention should be paid to the development of <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> to inhabitants of rural districts...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the impact of regulatory policy on the supply of <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> and on their geographical distribution in the Czech Republic. The analysis of regulatory policy is based on the review of literature. Trends and regional distribution were analysed quantitatively on the data for the period of 1990 to 2002. Regulation introduced in 1997 led to a financial stability of the health sector, but it did not have a great impact on the level and distribution of <b>outpatient</b> <b>services.</b> Regulatory policy can be seen as a failure if one assumes that improved quality, effectiveness, and efficiency are the objectives of the health system. The supply of <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> is unevenly distributed. For example, one-quarter of <b>outpatient</b> <b>services</b> in psychiatry is concentrated in the capital.

After arrival in late January 1880, he found a run-down hospital located in a former hotel and energetically took measures to construct a new building, establish <b>outpatient</b> <b>service,</b> and combat perception that the hospital was a place to die rather than to get well. In 1880, the hospital had 522 inpatients and 1,144 outpatients compared to just 19 patients during 1879. The position paid well, expenses were low, so he was able to quickly repay debts and accumulate savings. Basanavičius also wrote medical research articles, liberal political articles supporting Bulgarian politician Petko Karavelov, and cultural articles for Prussian Lithuanian press, including Tilžės Keleivis and Lietuwißka Ceitunga, and academic journal Mitteilungen der Litauischen literarischen Gesellschaft. However, these publications were too much under German control and did not satisfy growing needs of Lithuanian activists. Basanavičius contemplated establishing a truly Lithuanian newspaper.|$|E
