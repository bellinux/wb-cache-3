5|$|As older {{generation}} of Waffen-SS scribes has died off, a new, post-war cadre of writers has {{done much to}} perpetuate {{the image of the}} force as a revolutionary European army.

5|$|After the shootout in Tombstone, {{his pursuit}} {{and murder of}} those who {{attacked}} his brothers, and after leaving Arizona, Wyatt was often the target of negative newspaper stories that disparaged his and his brothers' reputation. His role in history has stimulated considerable ongoing scholarly and editorial debate. A large body of literature {{has been written about}} Wyatt Earp and his legacy, some of it highly fictionalized. Considerable portions of it are either full <b>of</b> <b>admiration</b> and flattery or hostile debunking.|$|E
5|$|Already as a teenager, Sorabji {{took great}} {{interest}} in recent developments in art music—in the work of Schoenberg, Scriabin, Mahler and Debussy, among others—at {{a time when they}} received scant attention in the United Kingdom. This interest, along with his ethnicity, cemented his reputation as an outsider. He and his music had their detractors, but some musicians received his work positively: Frederick Delius, who heard a 1930 radio broadcast of Sorabji playing his own piece Le jardin parfumé: Poem for Piano Solo, sent a letter <b>of</b> <b>admiration</b> to Sorabji; the French–Swiss pianist Alfred Cortot expressed interest in performing Sorabji's piano concertos; and Alban Berg reportedly took an interest in Sorabji's music.|$|E

5|$|They are an {{essential}} part of the most impressive and famous of the frescoes, the Creation of Adam. Adam gazes at God. God looks directly at Adam. And under God's protective arm, Eve turns her eyes sideways in a look <b>of</b> <b>admiration</b> for her husband-to-be. Again and again, Michelangelo painted telling gazes into the faces of his characters. The eye sockets of the family in the Zorobabel lunette are empty as are the eyes of the man in the Aminadab lunette, but the removal that has caused the most distress to the critics are the eyes of the little figure in green and white who once looked out of the gloom above the lunette of Jesse.|$|E
5|$|Years later, due to Betances' {{experience}} as a logistics facilitator of armed revolts, a fund raiser for the Cuban independence cause, and as a diplomat, José Martí asked Betances to become the leader of Cuban revolutionaries in France. Betances never met Martí personally, but Martí did know Betances' younger sister, Eduviges, who lived in New York City and shared her brother's revolutionary ideals. Martí assisted her financially in her final days, out <b>of</b> <b>admiration</b> for the Betances' family. Betances accepted the assignment out of gratitude towards Martí. Soon after, Martí died in battle in Cuba in 1895, an event that brought Tomás Estrada Palma to {{the leadership of the}} Cuban insurrection movement.|$|E

25|$|Ancient Rome was {{a source}} <b>of</b> <b>admiration</b> in Europe since the enlightenment. In France, Voltaire (1694-1778) {{was one of the}} most fervent admirers of Rome. He {{regarded}} highly the Roman republican values of rationality, democracy, order and justice. In early-eighteenth century Britain, it was poets and politicians like Joseph Addison (1672-1719) and Richard Glover (1712 –1785) who were vocal advocates of these ancient republican values.|$|E
25|$|Narcissistic {{supply is}} a concept {{introduced}} into psychoanalytic theory by Otto Fenichel in 1938, to describe a type <b>of</b> <b>admiration,</b> interpersonal support or sustenance drawn by an individual {{from his or her}} environment and essential to their self-esteem.

25|$|It {{was in the}} mid-eighteenth {{century that}} ancient Greece became a source <b>of</b> <b>admiration</b> among the French and British.

Ghat still harbors a sense <b>of</b> <b>admiration</b> for the single-mindedness of Corwids. Regardless, when he encounters them a fight ensues.|$|E
25|$|The {{reputation}} of Weldon Kees has seen as much neglect {{as it has}} keen attention. Weeks before his disappearance, a young poet in Florida, Donald Justice, attempted to write Kees a letter <b>of</b> <b>admiration</b> and to send him a sestina he had written since Kees excelled in that form. His letter {{found its way to}} Kees’s father, John, who eventually gave Justice permission to compile and edit The Collected Poems of Weldon Kees (Iowa City, IA: The Stone Wall Press, 1959), which was subsequently released as a trade paperback in the 1960s. Kees’s work attracted the attention of other younger poets and his work gradually became anthologized and received critical attention.|$|E
25|$|A {{few weeks}} later, Tebbit gave an {{interview}} to John Mortimer for The Spectator where he said of Thatcher: It's a question of her leadership when our aims aren't clearly defined. When people understand what she's doing there's a good deal <b>of</b> <b>admiration</b> for her energy and resolution and persistence, even from those people who don't agree with her. Now there's a perception that we don't know where we're going so those same qualities don't seem so attractive. Thatcher disagreed and her biographer claims she was suspicious of Tebbit's motives. Furthermore, Thatcher commissioned the firm Young and Rubicam {{to carry out their}} own polling, which concluded that Thatcher's leadership was not the problem. Throughout the rest of 1986 and into the 1987 election, Thatcher continued to use Young and Rubicam, which eventually caused tensions with Tebbit during the election campaign.|$|E
