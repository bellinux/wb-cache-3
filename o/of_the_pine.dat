5|$|As in {{the colonial}} period, the Pine Bush {{continued}} to be tapped for its natural resources, with water becoming a target for development. The Patroon Creek, roughly where three feeder streams joined in the heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Bush along Albany's northern border, was dammed in 1850 to form Rensselaer Lake waterworks.|$|E

5|$|Rum-runners {{used the}} Everglades as a hiding spot during Prohibition; {{it was so}} vast there were never enough law {{enforcement}} officers to patrol it. The arrival of the railroad, and the discovery that adding trace elements like copper was the remedy for crops sprouting and dying quickly, soon created a population boom. New towns such as Moore Haven, Clewiston, and Belle Glade sprouted like the crops. Sugarcane became the primary crop grown in South Florida. Miami experienced a second real estate boom that earned a developer in Coral Gables $150million. Undeveloped land north of Miami sold for $30,600 an acre. In 1925, Miami newspapers published editions weighing over , {{most of it in}} real estate advertising. Waterfront property was the most highly valued. Mangrove trees were cut down and replaced with palm trees to improve the view. Acres of South Florida slash pine were cleared. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pine</b> was for lumber, but most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pine</b> forests in Dade County were cleared for development.|$|E

5|$|In 1879 Henry Colton, {{who worked}} for the Williamsport Lumber Company, {{supervised}} the cutting of white pine on the land owned by Silas Billings; this land would later become the park. Colton gave his name to the Colton Point overlook on the west rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Creek Gorge. Deadman Hollow Road in the park is named for a trapper whose decomposed body was found in his own bear trap there in the early 20th century. Fourmile Run flows through the park: its O'Connor Branch is named for the dead trapper's brothers, who were loggers in the area.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after {{crossing}} into Vaughan, Highway407 encounters {{the first}} of three large interchanges with other 400-series highways in York Region. The Highway427 interchange is a four-level partial stack located just north of Steeles Avenue in Vaughan and adjacent to the 407 ETR Concession Company offices. The interchange features weaved ramps which connect to former Highway27, located just east. The route continues eastward, parallel and between Steeles Avenue and Highway7. It dives through the Humber River valley alongside a CN line and along the northern border of Thackeray Conservation Lands, passing beneath a CP line. After an interchange with Pine Valley Drive (York Regional Road57), the route becomes sandwiched between the industrial lands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Valley Business Park and the Emery Creek Corporate Park. A partial interchange with Weston Road (York Regional Road56) lies just west of the large four-level stack interchange with Highway400, the only of its kind in Ontario. An interchange with Jane Street (York Regional Road55) is interwoven into {{the east side of the}} Highway400 interchange, below which pass the completed tunnels of the currently under-construction future Line 1 Yonge–University subway line.|$|E
5|$|Just {{north of}} the {{community}} of Hale the road enters the Huron National Forest near Loon Lake. The trunkline takes a turn to the east as it passes along the Au Sable River. The River Road National Scenic Byway starts on M-65 at Rollways Road, and the highway generally follows the river as it passes by a former logging community which is commemorated by Lumberman's Monument. At the intersection with River Road, M-65 turns north to cross the Au Sable, and the byway designation continues east along River Road to follow the river to Oscoda. The M-65 bridge over the Au Sable is just downstream of the Five Channels Dam, crossing high above the water below. The highway turns northwesterly through forest land to cross into Alcona County. North of the county line, the trunkline follows Baker and State roads near Vaughn and Hunters lakes. M-65 meets the western terminus of county road F-30 in the community of Glennie. The highway also crosses the South Branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> River.|$|E

5|$|North of Glennie, {{the highway}} passes Clear Lake as it {{continues}} through rural Alcona County. Near the West Branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> River, M-65 merges with M-72. The two trunklines run concurrently curving {{to the northwest}} past the eastern terminus of county road F-32 into Curran. North of town, they separate as M-72 turns westward and M-65 continues north, exiting the Huron National Forest. The highway jogs along the Alcona–Alpena County line and crosses the Beaver Creek in the process. The trunkline runs {{to the east of}} Beaver Lake as it runs north through mixed forest and fields toward the community of Lachine. Southeast of that town, M-65 turns eastward along M-32 for a short distance before turning north into town. North of Lachine, the highway crosses the Thunder Bay River near the community of Long Rapids. As M-65 runs through the northern portion of Alpena County, it runs through the Mackinaw State Forest. The highway passes through the community of Posen in eastern Presque Isle County. The road continues due north to its terminus at an intersection with US23; the junction is inland from Lake Huron near Big and Little Trout lakes southeast of Rogers City.|$|E
5|$|Past here, Route 70 {{loses the}} Marlton Pike name and {{continues}} east into the heavily wooded Pine Barrens. It passes {{to the south}} of the Leisuretowne retirement village before entering predominantly rural areas, with two fire lanes paralleling the road on either side. Route 70 eventually turns slightly to the northeast and forms the border between Southampton Township to the north and Woodland Township to the south. Along this borderline, the route comes to the Four Mile Circle, where it intersects the western terminus of Route 72 as well as CR 644 and CR 646. Past the traffic circle, Route 70 becomes the border between Pemberton Township to the north and Woodland Township to the south. The road passes {{to the south of}} the wooded Presidential Lakes Estates residential development before turning northeast through more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Barrens entirely within Pemberton Township. The road passes near some cranberry bogs before intersecting CR 530. At this intersection, CR 530 heads east concurrent with Route 70.|$|E
5|$|Route 72 {{begins at}} the Four Mile Circle {{intersection}} with Route 70, CR 644, and CR 646 in Woodland Township, Burlington County, heading to the southeast on Barnegat Road, a two-lane undivided road. The route passes through heavily wooded areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Barrens that {{are a part of}} the Brendan T. Byrne State Forest. The road passes near a state hospital before coming to an intersection with the northern terminus of CR 563. Past CR 563, the route continues through the Pine Barrens, passing under an abandoned railroad line prior to a junction with CR 532. Here, Route 72 forms a concurrency with CR 532 and the road enters Barnegat Township in Ocean County, where it comes to a crossroads with CR 539. From this intersection, Route 72 and CR 532 continue to a junction with CR 610, where CR 532 splits from the route by heading to the east. A short distance later, the route intersects the western terminus of CR 554, which continues along Barnegat Road, and Route 72 turns to the south-southeast through more wooded areas.|$|E

5|$|Route 73 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 322 (Black Horse Pike) in Folsom, Atlantic County, {{heading to the}} northwest on Blue Anchor Road, a two-lane undivided county-maintained road signed as County Route 561 Spur. This portion of the route is officially considered a part of Route 73 but is not signed as such. The road runs through forested areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Barrens with some homes and farms, coming to a crossroads with Route 54. Following this intersection, the road continues northwest as Mays Landing Road, crossing over a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line. It enters a small corner of Hammonton before it crosses into Winslow Township in Camden County. Here, Route 73 crosses over a Southern Railroad of New Jersey railroad line and intersects County Route 725. From this point, the road heads north to a partial interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway that has access from southbound Route 73 to the eastbound Atlantic City Expressway and from the westbound Atlantic City Expressway to northbound Route 73.|$|E
5|$|Some of the driest {{land in the}} Everglades is pineland (also called pine rockland) ecosystem, {{located in}} the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod. Some floors, however, may have flooded {{solution}} holes or puddles {{for a few months}} at a time. The most significant feature of the pineland is the single species of South Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii). Pineland communities require fire to maintain them, and the trees have several adaptations that simultaneously promote and resist fire. The sandy floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pine</b> forest is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable. South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat. Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor, and opens pine cones to germinate seeds. A period without significant fire can turn pineland into a hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines. The understory shrubs in pine rocklands are the fire-resistant saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and West Indian lilac (Tetrazygia bicolor). The most diverse group of plants in the pine community are the herbs, of which there are two dozen species. These plants contain tubers and other mechanisms that allow them to sprout quickly after being charred.|$|E
5|$|The Albany Pine Bush {{is home to}} {{hundreds}} of species of Lepidoptera (moths), including over 40 Noctuidae considered to be pine barrens specialists. The most well-known species in the area is the Karner blue (Lycaeides melissa samuelis), discovered in the 1940s and named by the author Vladimir Nabokov. The butterfly {{is now on the}} Endangered Species List. Once found in large numbers throughout the grassy openings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pine</b> barrens, it is today extremely rare and found in a handful of sites. Attempts to reintroduce the butterfly focus on the food and host plant for its larvae – the wild blue lupine, which needs frequent forest fires to maintain its habitat. Other regionally rare butterflies include the dusted skipper (Atrytonopsis hianna), Henry's elfin (Incisalia henrici), frosted elfin (Incisalia irus), and Edward's hairstreak (Satyrium edwardsii). The inland barrens buck moth (Hemileuca maia) is a state-listed special concern animal; and other rare moths include the broad-lined catopyrrha (Catopyrrha coloraria), several noctuid moths (Apharetra purpurea, Chaetaglaea cerata, Chytonix sensilis, Macrochilo bivittata, and Zanclognatha martha), bird dropping moth (Cerma cora), and a geometrid moth (Itame). The Albarufan dagger moth was last seen in the Pine Bush in 1983 and is presumed locally extinct.|$|E
