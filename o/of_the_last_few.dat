During the interrogation, the barely functioning Spark had breached the Rubicon's firewalls and overpowered the onboard A.I.

5|$|The {{morning of}} the {{evacuation}} promised a perfect day. The sun rose out of a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. The sky was hopelessly blue {{and the sight of}} Hirta, green and pleasant as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7am boarded the Harebell. Although exhausted by the strain and hard work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.|$|E
5|$|Unbiunium has not {{yet been}} synthesised. Nevertheless, because it is only three {{elements}} away from the heaviest known element, oganesson (element 118), its synthesis may come in the near future; it is expected to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> reachable elements with current technology, and the limit may be anywhere between element 120 and 124. It will also likely be far more difficult to synthesise than the elements known so far up to 118, and still more difficult than elements 119 and 120. The team at RIKEN in Japan has plans to attempt the synthesis of element 121 in the future after its attempts on elements 119 and 120.|$|E

25|$|Much {{evidence}} suggests that for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> centuries, nutritional differences accounted for majority of variation of pubertal timing in different populations, and even among social classes in the same population.

In many populations the amount of variation attributable to nutrition is shrinking.|$|E
