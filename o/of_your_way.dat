500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} day of the trial, Winthrop recorded, [...] "Mrs. Hutchinson, the court you see hath labored to bring you to {{acknowledge}} the error <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> that so you might be reduced. The time now grows late. We shall therefore give you a little more time to consider of it and therefore desire that you attend the court again in the morning." [...] The first day had gone fairly well for Hutchinson, who had held her own in a battle of wits with the magistrates. Biographer Eve LaPlante suggests, [...] "Her success before the court may have astonished her judges, but it was no surprise to her. [...] She was confident of herself and her intellectual tools, largely because of the intimacy she felt with God." ...|$|E
500|$|At 13:32, {{during the}} zig-zag, it became {{apparent}} that Queen Mary would come too close to the cruiser and the liner's officer of the watch interrupted the turn to avoid Curacoa. Upon hearing this command, Illingworth told his officer to: [...] "Carry on with the zig-zag. These chaps are used to escorting; they will keep out <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> and won't interfere with you." [...] At 14:04, Queen Mary started the starboard turn from a position slightly behind the cruiser and at a distance of two cables (about [...] ). Boutwood perceived the danger, but the distance was too close for either of the hard turns ordered for each ship to make any difference at the speeds that they were travelling. Queen Mary struck Curacoa amidships at full speed, cutting the cruiser in half. The aft end sank almost immediately, {{but the rest of the}} ship stayed on the surface a few minutes longer.|$|E

It depicts six migrants travelling through extreme climates in the Sonoran Desert to reach Devil's Highway {{in an attempt to}} cross the Mexico – United States border. They journey from Tamaulipas and through the mountains along Devil's Highway. Partway into the journey, the migrants are abandoned by their coyote guide and subsequently lose one another one by one. They experience thirst, hunger, injury, and fear, culminating with the only two surviving migrants being turned away by a vigilante at the border. Cooder said of the route's background and the narrative in an interview, [...] "t's been a migrant trail for 200 years. People go out there and try to do it on foot, but if you make one mistake and go five minutes out <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>way,</b> you become disorientated and dehydrated. And they find these mummified bodies out there. The heat has just baked them through. And the people who live through it often refer to having a vision of the Virgin of Guadalupe flying overhead. This is a very common vision when the dehydration sets in." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah! I was {{speaking}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> looks then, and <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>ways</b> now. You {{used to be}} so rough to me, and so masterful, and would have <b>your</b> own <b>way,</b> like the little man that you were. I can see you now with your touzled brown hair and your mischievous eyes. And now you are so gentle and quiet and soft-spoken." ...|$|R
2500|$|That such {{a letter}} was a fiction was {{demonstrated}} very soon after; when Stephen asked Desiderius to fulfil the promises {{he had made}} over the body of Saint Peter, the Lombard king responded: ”Be content that I removed Christophorus and Sergius, who were ruling you, out <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>way,</b> and ask not for rights. Besides, if I do not continue to help you, great trouble will befall you. For Carloman, king of the Franks, is the friend of Christophorus and Sergius, and will be wishful to come to Rome and seize you.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2001, Zhang was {{transferred}} to the eastern coastal province of Shandong to become governor. He began serving as provincial party chief, the first-in-charge of the province, beginning in 2002. In Shandong, Zhang told a gathering of assembled local officials, [...] "whether it is my relatives, children, friends; if they go to where you are, please do not go out <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> to receive them, do not curry favour with them, and do not offer to do things for them." [...] This was seen as Zhang trying to send a signal that he intended to distance himself from a political culture rife with corruption and complex rules around guanxi. In Shandong, Zhang was known to conduct 'undercover visits' to survey the lives of ordinary people. When Zhang left office, Shandong's GDP had exceeded 2 trillion yuan (~$300 billion), ranking second among provinces in the country.|$|E

5000|$|Although quick-witted, {{and quick}} to respond, Eliphaz loses his {{composure}} in chapter 22, accusing Job of oppressing widows and orphans, {{a far cry}} from how he had originally described Job: [...] "Behold you have admonished many, and you have strengthened weak hands. Your words have helped the tottering to stand, and you have strengthened feeble knees. But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; it touches you, and you are dismayed.
