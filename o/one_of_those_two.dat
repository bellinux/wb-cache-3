By 1962, all but two major West Coast cities had made the change and begun subsidizing transit, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> exceptions was Portland, served by the Rose City Transit Company (with San Diego being the other). By 1967, RCT was the last remaining privately owned big-city transit system on the West Coast, after San Diego Transit became municipalized. Rose City Transit's annual ridership declined from 32.3million in 1956 to 15.7million in 1968.|$|E

The Nottinghamshire side of the late 1920s was a settled and successful unit under the captaincy of Arthur Carr, with apparently ageless batsmen such as George Gunn, Wilfred Payton and the slightly younger William Whysall, Willis Walker and Carr himself dominating the batting line-up. Keeton and other young batsmen such as Charles Harris and George Gunn junior were given few first-team opportunities, and Keeton played in just five games in 1928 and two in the Championship-winning season of 1929 – <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> was against Oxford University – and none at all in both 1927 and 1930.|$|E

The DMK routed the INC in the 1967 elections and {{took control of the}} state government, ending INC's stronghold in Tamil Nadu. C.N. Annadurai became the DMK's first Chief Minister. M Karunanidhi took over as Chief Minister and party leader after Annadurai's death in 1969. Karunanidhi's leadership was soon challenged by MG Ramachandran, popularly known as MGR. In 1972, he split from DMK and formed the Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK) and later renamed the party as All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. He was the Chief Minister of the state from 1977 until his death in 1987. After the death of MGR, AIADMK was defeated in 1989 assembly polls because of the split of the party into two factions headed by Janaki (wife of MGR) and Jayalalithaa. Later on J. Jayalalithaa took control of the party. She was elected as the General Secretary of the unified AIADMK.

2500|$|The verb {{classes in}} Arabic are formed along two axes. The first or derivational axis (described as [...] "form I", [...] "form II", etc.) {{is used to}} specify {{grammatical}} concepts such as causative, intensive, passive or reflexive and mostly involves varying the consonants of a stem form. For example, from the root K-T-B [...] "write" [...] are derived form I kteb/ykteb [...] "write", form II ketteb/yketteb [...] "cause to write", form III kateb/ykateb [...] "correspond with (someone)" [...] etc. The second or weakness axis (described as [...] "strong", [...] "weak", [...] "hollow", [...] "doubled" [...] or [...] "assimilated") {{is determined by the}} specific consonants making up the root, especially whether a particular consonant is a [...] "w" [...] or [...] " [...] y", and mostly involves varying the nature and location of the vowels of a stem form. For example, so-called weak verbs have <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> letters as the last root consonant, which is reflected in the stem as a final vowel instead of a final consonant (ṛma/yṛmi [...] "throw" [...] from Ṛ-M-Y).

2500|$|In {{trying to}} show that quantum {{mechanics}} was not a complete theory, Einstein started with the theory's prediction that two or more particles that have interacted in the past can appear strongly correlated when their various properties are later measured.

[...] The argument is worked out in a famous paper, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (1935; abbreviated EPR), setting out {{what is now called}} the EPR paradox. Assuming what is now usually called local realism, EPR attempted to show from quantum theory that a particle has both position and momentum simultaneously, while according to the Copenhagen interpretation, only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> properties actually exists and only at the moment that it is being measured.

In the same year, Erwin Schrödinger used the word [...] "entanglement" [...] and declared: [...] "I would not call that one but rather the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics."

An article written by a staff member of The Philadelphia Inquirer refuted allegations of McNabb throwing up during the Super Bowl and even labeled the alleged incident [...] "a myth". Both head coach Andy Reid and McNabb have denied any physical problems that led to the puzzlingly slow pace of play.

It {{is not clear}} whether the combinations of predictive findings might imply diverse severities or different mortalities. MethodsA prospective two centre cohort study was performed of 385 severe CAP patients fulfilling three or more IDSA/ATS minor criteria amongst 1430 patients. ResultsHospital mortality rose sharply from 5. 7 %, 9. 9 %, and 16. 5 %, respectively, for patients with none of three predictive findings most strongly associated to mortality (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤ 250 mm Hg, confusion and uraemia), <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those,</b> and <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> to 38. 6 % for patients with all those (p< 0. 001). The number of three predictive findings present had a significantly increased odds ratio for mortality of 2. 796 (p< 0. 001), and had the degree of positive association with sequential organ failure assessment scores at 72 hours, incurring significantly longer hospital stay and higher costs. ConclusionsDifferent combinations of 2007 IDSA/ATS minor criteria for severe CAP were associated to diverse severities and different mortalities.
