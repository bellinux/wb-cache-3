5|$|After the shooting, Yousafzai was airlifted to a {{military}} hospital in Peshawar, where doctors were forced to begin operating after swelling developed in the left portion <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain,</b> which had been damaged by the bullet when it passed through her head. After a five-hour operation, doctors successfully removed the bullet, which had lodged in her shoulder near her spinal cord. The day following the attack, doctors performed a decompressive craniectomy, in which part of the skull is removed to allow room for the brain to swell.|$|E

25|$|Acquaintances said Spencer {{expressed}} {{hostility toward}} policemen, {{had talked about}} shooting one, and had talked of doing something big to get on TV. Although Spencer showed exceptional ability in photography, winning first prize in a Humane Society competition, she was generally uninterested in school; one teacher recalled frequently inquiring if she was awake in class. Later, during tests {{while she was in}} custody, it was discovered Spencer had an injury to the temporal lobe <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain.</b> It was attributed to an accident on her bicycle.|$|E
25|$|Curtiss, Fromkin, and Krashen {{continued}} to measure Genie's mental age {{through a variety}} of measures, and she consistently showed an extremely high degree of scatter. She measured significantly higher on tests which did not require language, such as the Leiter Scale, than on tests with any kind of language component, such as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. In addition, throughout Genie's stay with the Riglers they tested a variety <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain</b> functions and her performance on different tasks. For these they primarily used tachistoscopic tests, and during 1974 and 1975 they also gave her a series of evoked response tests.|$|E

25|$|Another case {{described}} {{the onset of}} anterograde amnesia {{as a result of}} cell death in the fornix, another structure that carries information from the hippocampus to the structures of the limbic system and the diencephalon. The patient in this case did not show any disconnection syndrome, which is unexpected since the structures involved divide the brain hemispheres (both sides <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain</b> were able to communicate). Instead, she showed signs of amnesia. The final diagnosis was made by MRI. This particular amnesic syndrome is difficult to diagnose and often is misdiagnosed by physicians as an acute psychiatric disorder.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in January 1971 {{scientists}} {{conducted a}} series of neurolinguistic tests on Genie to determine and monitor the course and extent of her mental development, making her the first language-deprived child to undergo any detailed study <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain.</b> Genie's entire brain was physically intact and Shurley's sleep-studies found sleep patterns typical of a left-hemisphere dominant person, leading scientists to believe she was most likely right-handed. Over the following years multiple tests of her handedness bolstered this conclusion, as did observations of her in everyday situations. Based on their early tests, doctors suspected Genie's brain was extremely right-hemisphere dominant.|$|E
25|$|Starting in {{the fall}} of 1971, under the {{direction}} of Curtiss, Victoria Fromkin, and Stephen Krashen—who was then also one of Fromkin's graduate students—linguists continued to administer regular dichotic listening tests to Genie until 1973. Their results consistently corroborated the initial findings of Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima. Researchers therefore concluded that Genie was acquiring language in the right hemisphere <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain,</b> and definitively ruled out the possibility that Genie's language lateralization was only reversed. Due to the lack of physiological problems with Genie's left hemisphere, they believed abnormal neurological activity in her left hemisphere—which they speculated came from her atrophied language center—blocked all language reception in her right ear but did not obstruct non-language sounds.|$|E

25|$|Genie's {{language}} acquisition also refined existing hypotheses and {{gave rise to}} additional hypotheses about what parts of language the right hemisphere could acquire after the critical period. Throughout {{the course of her}} linguistic development her language had remained largely congruous with adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients. By contrast, in both previous and subsequent studies, people with the same conditions who began acquiring language in their right hemispheres prior {{to the end of the}} critical period had developed normal vocabulary and grammar. This further convinced the scientists that Genie's {{language acquisition}} was abnormal because she had started after the critical period, and therefore was processing language in the right hemisphere <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain.</b>|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} case studies of {{language}} acquisition in a child with delayed linguistic development outside of studies on deaf children. Susan Curtiss argued that, even if humans possess the innate ability to acquire language, Genie demonstrated the necessity of early language stimulation in the left hemisphere of the brain to start. Since Genie never fully acquired grammar, Curtiss submitted that Genie provided evidence for a weaker variation of the critical period hypothesis. Genie's nonverbal skills were exceptionally good, which demonstrated that even nonverbal communication was fundamentally different from language. Because Genie's language acquisition occurred in the right hemisphere <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain,</b> its course also aided linguists in refining existing hypotheses on the capacity for right-hemisphere language acquisition in people after the critical period.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{performance}} on these tests led the scientists {{to believe that}} her brain had lateralized, and that her right hemisphere had undergone specialization. Because Genie's performance was so high on such {{a wide variety of}} tasks predominantly utilizing the right hemisphere <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain,</b> they concluded her exceptional abilities extended to typical right-hemisphere functions in general and were not specific to any individual task. They attributed her extreme right hemisphere dominance to the fact that what very little cognitive stimulation she did receive was almost entirely visual and tactile. While even this had been extremely minimal it had been enough to commence lateralization in her right hemisphere, and the severe imbalance in stimulation caused her right hemisphere to become extraordinarily developed.|$|E

6000|$|Her {{faith in}} her father had an {{infinite}} pathos at the moment. She loved the house. It was a part <b>of</b> <b>her</b> very <b>brain</b> and blood.

50|$|While Quinlan {{was alive}} the extent <b>of</b> damage to <b>her</b> <b>brain</b> stem {{could not be}} {{precisely}} determined. After she died <b>her</b> entire <b>brain</b> and spinal cord were studied carefully. While her cerebral cortex had moderate scarring, it seemed that her thalamus was extensively damaged bilaterally. <b>Her</b> <b>brain</b> stem (which controls breathing and cardiac functions) was undamaged. These {{findings suggest that the}} thalamus plays a particularly important role in consciousness.|$|R
25|$|By {{the time}} the {{scientists}} finished working with Genie, she had not fully mastered English grammar and her rate of acquisition had significantly slowed down. Linguists ultimately concluded that because Genie had not learned a first language before the critical period had ended, {{she was unable to}} fully acquire a language. Furthermore, despite the clear improvements in her conversational competence it remained very low, and her vocalizations remained highly atypical. While she had expanded her use of language to serve a wider range of functions, she had an unusually difficult time utilizing it during social interactions. Tests on Genie's brain found she was acquiring language in the right hemisphere <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain</b> despite being right-handed, giving rise to many new hypotheses and refining existing hypotheses on cerebral lateralization and its effect on linguistic development.|$|E
25|$|Linguists also {{administered}} several brain exams specifically geared towards measuring Genie's language comprehension. On {{one such}} test {{she had no}} difficulty giving the correct meaning of sentences containing familiar homophones, demonstrating that her receptive comprehension was significantly better than her expressive language. Genie also did very well at identifying rhymes, both tasks that adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients had previously been recorded performing well on. During these tests an EEG consistently picked up more activity from the two electrodes over the right hemisphere <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain</b> than from those over the normal locations of the Broca's area and Wernicke's area, and found especially high involvement from her right anterior cerebral cortex, lending further support to the researchers' conclusion that Genie was using her right hemisphere to acquire language.|$|E
25|$|In early March of that year, neuroscientists Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima {{came from}} the Salk Institute for Biological Studies to {{administer}} their own series of brain exams on Genie. Audiometry tests confirmed that she had regular hearing in both ears, but {{on a series of}} dichotic listening tests Bellugi and Klima found that she identified language sounds with 100% accuracy in her left ear while correctly answering at only a chance level in her right ear. Such an extreme level of asymmetry on these tests had previously only been documented in patients with either split-brain or who had undergone a hemispherectomy as an adult. When they gave her monaural tests for both language and non-language sounds she answered with 100% accuracy in both ears, which was normal. On non-language dichotic listening tests she showed a slight preference for identifying non-language sounds in her left ear, which was typical for a right-handed person and helped rule out the possibility <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>brain</b> only being reversed in dominance for language.|$|E

Halsey justifies her actions through her belief that the suffering of a few is acceptable for the benefit of many. Sergeant Johnson, however, unknowingly causes Halsey to rethink her position, and she decides to [...] "save each and every member of humanity beginning with herself" [...] during Halo: First Strike. She hijacks a shuttle for her own private mission to the planet Onyx; there, she assists in deciphering the surrounding Forerunner glyphs on the planet and leads the surviving Spartan-IIs and Spartan-IIIs to a Dyson Sphere at the heart of Onyx.
