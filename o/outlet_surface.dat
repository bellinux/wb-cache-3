40|$|The {{moisture}} transport in capillary-porous {{building materials}} {{is governed by}} their microstructure. This thesis describes the calculation of hygric material properties from three-dimensional representations of the building materials' microstructures using finite element methods. The moisture transport processes considered comprise the water permeation, the water diffusion and the capillary absorption. Three hardened cement pastes with two different water to cement ratios, and two sandstones, a Fontainebleau and a Bentheimer sandstone serve as examples of capillary-porous materials. The basis of the calculations are microtomographic images (µCT) of the hardened cement pastes and the sandstones, as well as microstructures of the hardened cement pastes generated with the simulation software CEMHYD 3 D. To what extend the latter are realistic is investigated by comparing the fractal dimension and the autocorrelation function of the pore spaces of the simulated microstructures {{as well as their}} pore space distribution with the corresponding values of the µCT images. In order to simulate the different moisture transport processes the medial axis of the pore spaces of the microstructures is first extracted. Afterwards the medial axis is converted into a transportation network, consisting of cylindrical tubes, which possesses the same moisture transport properties as the original pore space. In case of permeability Bernoulli's law is applied to every tube in the transportation network. An arbitrary pressure difference of 1 bar is imposed between the inlet and the <b>outlet</b> <b>surface</b> of the network and the resulting mass flow is calculated by finite element methods. The overall mass flow results from the sum of the mass flows of the tubes traversing the <b>outlet</b> <b>surface.</b> Using Darcy's law the permeability coefficient of the porous medium is derived. The water vapor diffusion is simulated using Fick's first law for every tube {{as well as for the}} mass current density within the porous medium. Between inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>surface</b> a water vapor concentration difference of 10 % is applied and the water vapor diffusion coefficient of the hardened cement pastes and the sandstones is deduced from the resulting mass flow. Finally the capillary water absorption of the porous media is simulated analogously to the heat conduction. The individual tubes of the network are replaced by one-dimensional heat conducting elements. The temperature conduction coefficients of the elements and the boundary conditions are adjusted so that the time needed for the heat flow to traverse an element is equivalent to the time required by the water front during the capillary water uptake. The water absorption coefficients of the materials contemplated are then obtained from the amount of absorpted water at each time step of the finite element calculation. The validation of the presented model is accomplished by comparing the simulated moisture transportation coefficients with experimental values...|$|E

This study {{shows how the}} reacting flow within a gas turbine combustion chamber can {{be influenced by the}} description of the downstream boundary. LES calculations are performed on a combustion chamber terminated by a High Pressure Stator (HPS) containing vanes where the flow is usually choked and submitted to strong rotation effects. HPS are present in all real gas turbines but they are often not computed and simply replaced by a constant pressure outlet condition. This study compares an LES calculation where the HPS is replaced by a constant pressure <b>outlet</b> <b>surface</b> and an LES where the HPS is included in the computational domain and explicitly computed. The comparison of the flow in the chamber in both LES reveals that the presence of the HPS modifies the mean flow {{in the second part of}} the chamber but does not affect the primary combustion zone. The unsteady field, on the other hand, is strongly affected by the HPS. Results demonstrate that HPS should be included in realistic LES of combustion chambers for gas turbines...|$|E

40|$|The {{control of}} the surface {{temperature}} of ceramic tiles in a real industrial production line is developed. The process consists of a transportation band that carries the hot tiles through a water sprayer {{whose objective is to}} reduce its temperature. Two input signals can be modified: the velocity of the transportation band and the flow rate of the sprayer. In order to control the <b>outlet</b> <b>surface</b> temperature, the quantity of water deposited (and hence evaporated) per tile, that is a static function of the velocity and the flow rate, is used as the control input. The inlet temperature has a tile to tile fast pattern variation and a slow average change. First, the experimental identification of the process model is carried out. Then a feedback PI controller based on the measurement of the outlet temperature is then tested, showing a good average tracking, but a poor compensation of the fast variations. An adaptive feedforward control based on the measurement of the inlet and outlet temperatures is developed and also tested in the plant, showing a much better performance, but a higher cost. Finally, a disturbance observer based feedforward control is tested, showing an intermediate performance and cost. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} survey, various methods for the {{acoustic}} design of aeroengine nacelle are first briefly introduced {{along with the}} comments on their advantages and disadvantages for practical application, and then detailed analysis and discussion focus {{on a kind of}} new method which is called “transfer element method” (TEM) with emphasis on its application in the following three problems: turbomachinery noise generations, sound transmission in ducts and radiation from the inlet and outlet of ducts, as well as the interaction between them. In the theoretical frame of the TEM, the solution of acoustic field in an infinite duct with stator sound source or liner is extended to that in a finite domain with all knows and unknowns on the interface plane, and the relevant acoustic field is solved by setting up matching equation. In addition, based on combining the TEM with the boundary element method (BEM) by establishing the pressure and its derivative continuum conditions on the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>surface,</b> the sound radiation from the inlet and outlet of ducts can also be investigated. Finally, the effects of various interactions between the sound source and acoustic treatment have been discussed in this survey.

40|$|Due to the {{combined}} effect {{of wind and}} rain, the importance of storm movement to surface flow has long been recognized, at scales ranging from headwater scales to large basins. This study {{presents the results of}} laboratory experiments designed to investigate the influence of moving rainfall storms on the dynamics of sediment transport by surface runoff. Experiments were carried out, using a rain simulator and a soil flume. The movement of rainfall was generated by moving the rain simulator at a constant speed in the upstream and downstream directions along the flume. The main objective {{of the study was to}} characterize, in laboratory conditions, the distribution of sediment grain-size transported by rainfall-induced overland flow and its temporal evolution. Grain-size distribution of the eroded material is governed by the capacity of flow that transports sediments. Granulometric curves were constructed using conventional hand sieving and a laser diffraction particle size analyser (material below 0. 250 mm) for overland flow and sediment deliveries collected at the flume <b>outlet.</b> <b>Surface</b> slope was set at 2 %, 7 % and 14 %. Rainstorms were moved with a constant speed, upslope and downslope, along the flume or were kept static. The results of laboratory experiments show that storm movement, affecting the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall, has a marked influence on the grain-size characteristics of sediments transported by overland flow. The downstream-moving rainfall storms have higher stream power than do other storm types.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from December 10, 2015 - December 10, 2016 Stream discharge is a key water balance component and important factor in global change evaluations. Nevertheless, the mechanisms for streamflow generation are poorly understood. Near- stream surface saturation during precipitation events {{is one of the}} most iconic, visible indicators of rapid runoff production in upland humid catchments around the world. Despite years of study, we lack understanding of what occurs within the near-stream saturated area, its mixing dynamics and how this affects catchment geochemical- and flow-response dynamics during events. This thesis explores the mechanisms that control near-stream saturated area behavior in a headwater catchment. First, I explore the relation between catchment geochemical response and the flow duration curve (FDC) for the 46 -ha Weierbach catchment in Luxembourg across 10 years of runoff monitoring. The shape of the Weierbach FDC suggested a two-phase system, a high-flow, precipitation-driven period and a dry, evapotranspiration-driven, low-flow period. I hypothesized that the two phases were correlated with activation of shallow hillslope and subsurface streamflow sources and that the activation of these sources would be reflected in stream chemistry and surface saturation dynamics. During high-flow periods of the FDC, stream geochemistry was largely unchanging, lacking a dilution effect and appeared a mix of the highly variable soil and groundwater. Thermal infrared (TIR) imagery suggested large surface saturation dynamics at high flows. The geochemical signature of streamflow and soil riparian water during low-flow periods most closely resembled groundwater chemistry and led to increasing base cation concentrations and electrical conductivity. Secondly, to better understand the effect of rain falling on saturated areas and the contribution of rainfall to saturation excess overland flow, I quantified surface saturation dynamics in a near- stream area during rainfall events using high-frequency TIR imagery. During 10 rainfall events across a 34 -day period starting December 2013, a total of 161 mm of rainfall elicited 133 mm of runoff at the 6 -ha <b>outlet.</b> <b>Surface</b> saturation within a 25 -m² thermal infrared imaged area increased from 2 to 20...|$|E
