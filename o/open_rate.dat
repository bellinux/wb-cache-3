40|$|Abstract—Billions {{of dollars}} of {{services}} and goods are sold through email marketing. Subject lines have a strong influence on <b>open</b> <b>rates</b> of the emails, as the consumers often open emails based on the subject. Traditionally, the email-subject lines are compiled based on the best assessment of the human editors. We propose a method to help the editors by predicting subject line <b>open</b> <b>rates</b> by learning from past subject lines. The method derives different types of features from subject lines based on keywords, performance of past subject lines and syntax. Furthermore, we evaluate the contribution of individual subject-line keywords to overall <b>open</b> <b>rates</b> based on an iterative method—namely Attribution Scoring—and use this for improved predictions. A random forest based model is trained to combine these features to predict the performance. We use a dataset {{of more than a}} hundred thousand different subject lines with many billions of impressions to train and test the method. The proposed method shows significant improvement in prediction accuracy over the baselines for both new as well as already used subject lines. Keywords-email; deals; subject; learning I...|$|R

The effectiveness of the push notification is generally measured by message <b>open</b> <b>rate.</b> A push message can contain a recommended product, a shopping news and etc., but often {{only one or two}} items can be shown in the push message due to the limit of display space.

40|$|Abstract. Ontology reuse saves {{costs and}} {{improves}} interoperability between ontologies. Knowing which ontology to reuse is difficult {{without having a}} quality assessment. We employ user ratings to determine the user-perceived quality of ontologies. The combination of an <b>Open</b> <b>Rating</b> System (ORS), user ratings, and information on trust between users, allow us to compute a personalized ranking of ontologies. In this paper, we present our extension, the Topic-Specific Trust <b>Open</b> <b>Rating</b> System (TS-ORS). To overcome {{the limitations of the}} ORS, the TS-ORS features topic-specific trust and multi-faceted ratings. In a user study, we show that having user ratings and result ranking based on a TS-ORS significantly facilitates ontology assessment and selection for the end user. ...|$|R

When they become full of sediment, {{they control the}} amount of outwash {{in accordance with the}} gradient of the sedimentation slope. On the other hand, the slit type sabo dams discharges sediment downstream during the usual small scale floods, while it dams up and catches sediment to control the amount of outwash during large scale floods are not planned. Moreover, the slit type sabo dams are considered to be preferable environmentally because the direct connection between the upstream and downstream areas of the channel is maintained so that fish can pass through the dam freely. In this study, {{in order to determine the}} appropriate width of the slit of the slit sabo dams to promote the effective catching of bed load sediment during large scale flood, examples of hydraulic model experiments are described using topographic models that reproduced a field model. The results are summarized as follows: Even if the total width of the slits is appropriate, the amount of controlled sediments changed with the difference in the width of each slit. Moreover, paying attention to the <b>open</b> <b>rate</b> of slit sabo dams and the occurrence of dam-up, height and length of dam-up were investigated experimentally by changing the <b>open</b> <b>rate.</b> The results are summarized as follows: Whether dam-up occurrence depends largely on the <b>open</b> <b>rate,</b> and the smaller <b>open</b> <b>rate</b> causes dam-up to occur more easily.

A retractable structure based on threefold-symmetric Bricard linkages and rotating rings of tetrahedra is proposed and developed in this paper. By replacing each link of a threefold-symmetric Bricard linkage with a tetrahedron, a retractable structure is obtained which can repeatedly open and close by rotating the tetrahedra. The geometric relationship between the retractable structure and the threefold-symmetric Bricard linkage is derived and ranges of main geometric parameters are determined to ensure a continuous and smooth movement in the deployment of the structure. Then {{the relative displacement of}} the support and the <b>open</b> <b>rate</b> of the structure, two main parameters concerned in practical applications, are investigated.

40|$|Background: Although, {{there are}} {{studies in the}} {{literature}} having shown the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic adrenalectomy, there are still debates for tumour size and the requirement of the minimal invasive approach. Our hypothesis was {{that the use of}} laparoscopy facilitates minimally invasive resection of large adrenal tumours regardless of tumour size. Materials and Methods: Within 7 years, 149 patients underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy at one institution. The patients were divided into two study groups according to tumour size. Group 1 included patients with adrenal tumours smaller than 5 cm and group 2 included larger than 5 cm. Patient demographics and clinical parameters, operative time, complications, hospital stay and final pathology were analysed. Statistical analyses of clinical and perioperative parameters were performed using Student′s t-test and Chi-square tests. Results: There were 88 patients in group 1 and 70 in group 2. There {{were no significant differences between}} study groups regarding patient demographics, operative time, hospital stay, and complications. Estimated blood loss was significantly higher in group 2 (P = 0. 002). The conversion to <b>open</b> <b>rate</b> was similar between study groups with 5. 6 % versus 4. 2 %, respectively.
