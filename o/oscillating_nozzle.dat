40|$|Many {{semiarid}} and arid {{soils are}} prone to irrigation-induced ero-sion. Polyacrylamide (PAM) greatly reduces erosion from furrow irrigation. We hypothesized that PAM applied via sprinklers will provide erosion control and benefit water infiltration and aggregate stability. Screened (6. 4 mm) Rad silt loam (coarse silty, mixed, super-active mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplocambid) was placed in 1. 5 by 1. 2 by 0. 2 m steel boxes with 2. 4 % slope. An <b>oscillating</b> <b>nozzle,</b> 3 m above the soil, produced a median drop size of 1. 2 mm diameter. We applied 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 kg ha ' PAM in 20 mm {{of water in the}} first irrigation, followed by two 20 -mm water-only irrigations. In a second test, we applied 0, 2, and 4 kg ha ' PAM in 8 mm of water in the first irrigation, followed by two 20 -mm water-only irrigations. Two kilograms per hectare PAM in the first 20 -mm irrigation reduced runoff 70 % and soil loss 75 % compared to control. Polyacrylamide in 8 mm of wate...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} of {{hydrodynamic}} modulation voltammetry (HMV) is introduced, {{based on the}} microjet electrode (MJE) with an <b>oscillating</b> <b>nozzle</b> position. In MJE-HMV a jet of solution is fired at high velocities from a nozzle (with a typical diameter in the range 25 - 50 mu m) {{onto the surface of}} a disk ultramicroelectrode (UME). The mass transport rate to the electrode is modulated by oscillating the lateral position of the jet between two different coordinates: one where the jet impinges directly on the electrode surface and the other where the flowing stream (largely) misses the electrode. The resulting modulated (transport-limited) current in phase with the moving jet is quantitative and discriminates effectively against background processes. Studies of iridium (III) hexachloride (IrCl 63 -) oxidation at a Pt MJE serve to demonstrate the general capabilities of the technique. For this system, detection limits are estimated to be similar to 5 x 10 (- 9) mol dm(- 3). In its present form, modulation frequencies of as much as 20 Hz can be successfully employed without serious attenuation of the current signal, and there is scope for further improvement through the use of smaller nozzles and electrodes and piezoelectric positioners with improved frequency responses...|$|E
40|$|The {{key feature}} of liquid wall {{chambers}} {{is the use}} of a renewable liquid layer to protect chamber structures from target emissions. Two primary options have been proposed and studied: wetted wall chambers and thick liquid wall (TLW) chambers. With wetted wall designs, a thin layer of liquid shields the structural first wall from short ranged target emissions (x-rays, ions and debris) but not neutrons. Various schemes have been proposed to establish and renew the liquid layer between shots including flow-guiding porous fabrics (e. g., Osiris, HIBALL), porous rigid structures (Prometheus) and thin film flows (KOYO). The thin liquid layer can be the tritium breeding material (e. g., flibe, PbLi, or Li) or another liquid metal such as Pb. TLWs use liquid jets injected by stationary or <b>oscillating</b> <b>nozzles</b> to form a neutronically thick layer (typically with an effective thickness of {approx} 50 cm) of liquid between the target and first structural wall. In addition to absorbing short ranged emissions, the thick liquid layer degrades the neutron flux and energy reaching the first wall, typically by {approx} 10 x x, so that steel walls can survive {{for the life of the}} plant ({approx} 30 - 60 yrs). The thick liquid serves as the primary coolant and tritium breeding material (most recent designs use flibe, but the earliest concepts used Li). In essence, the TLW places the fusion blanket inside the first wall instead of behind the first wall...|$|R

This paper presents the an experimental investigation on the impact of using nozzle oscillation cutting technique in minimising or reducing these AWJ cut surface irregularities. The technique was used for cutting ductile materials, i. e. mild steel and aluminium, at various traverse speeds, oscillation angles and frequencies of oscillation. The results show that by <b>oscillating</b> the <b>nozzle</b> during cutting, the improvement in surface finish as measured by center-line average Ra can be obtained by as much as 30 %...|$|R
50|$|Train horns are {{operated}} by compressed air, typically 125-140 psi (8.6-9.6 bar), and fed from a locomotive main air reservoir. When the engineer opens the horn valve, air flows through a supply line into the power chamber {{at the base}} of the horn (diagram, right). It passes through a narrow opening between a nozzle and a circular diaphragm in the power chamber, then out through the flaring horn bell. The flow of air past the diaphragm causes it to vibrate or <b>oscillate</b> against the <b>nozzle,</b> producing sound.|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 109 - 113. Various {{transducers}} {{have been}} developed turbulent shear in the ocean. The airfoil probe with it's piezoceramic beam encapsulated in a rubber airfoil has the simplest electronic processing system. However, the beam is very fragile and displays unpredictable thermal effects. An airfoil probe with semiconductor strain gauges on an aluminium cantilever beam has been developed {{as an alternative to}} the piezoceramic beam. The probe was calibrated by exciting it with a known shear generated by the water flow from an <b>oscillating</b> <b>nozzle.</b> During the calibration the thermal sensitivity of the probe was established to be - 1. 7 % °C- 1 • The probe, along with it's high gain, low noise processing system, is fitted to a tethered free-fall vehicle. A solid state data logger situated in the vehicle is used to record the data generated by the turbulence probe and a pressure transducer. Field trials at St. Helena Bay and Hout Bay showed that the sensitivity of the system is 20 dB lower than that of similar systems using piezoceramic beams. The system is able to resolve turbulent dissipation levels above 10 - 8 W kg- 1, making it useful in regions characterised by a typical mixed layer (dissipation level of 10 -W kg- 1); however, it's sensitivity is not adequate for deep sea measurements where dissipation levels may be as low as 10 - 10 W kg- 1...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. In line jets are used throughout industry for drying and heat transfer. A simple modification to an in line jet offers significant enhancement of transport properties. The addition of a collar to an in line jet exit introduces an acoustic standing wave and flow fluctuations that need no external input. The new oscillating jet when used for impingement surface transport was labeled the Self-Oscillating Jet Impingement Nozzle. The objectives of this research were to characterize the gains in heat transfer caused by utilizing this nozzle in contrast to standard non-oscillating jets. The study consisted of flow visualization, acoustic measurements and heat transfer testing for many parameters. The parameters included nozzle length, flow rate, collar length, and nozzle-to-surface spacing. A nozzle was designed using previous research analysis. A method of freezing the oscillating flow structures for visualization was developed. The acoustically driven oscillations issuing from the <b>oscillating</b> <b>nozzle</b> caused enhanced vortex shedding from jet shear layers and higher mixing rates. The turbulence level on the impingement surface was greatly increased and a large amplitude unsteady stagnation point location was introduced. Heat transfer test and acoustic mapping were carried out for all the listed parameters. Correlations for frequency were obtained to predict nozzle frequency performance...|$|E
40|$|Soil surface {{roughness}} is commonly identified {{as one of}} the dominant factors governing runoff and interrill erosion. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare several existing soil {{surface roughness}} indices and to test the use of the revised triangular prism surface area method (RTPM) to calculate the fractal dimension as a roughness index. A silty clay loam soil was sampled, sieved to four aggregate sizes, and each size was packed in soil trays in order to derive four different soil surface roughness classes. Rainfall simulations using an <b>oscillating</b> <b>nozzle</b> simulator were conducted for 90 min at 50. 2 mm h- 1 average intensity. The surface microtopography was digitized by an instantaneous profile laser scanner before and after the rainfall application. Calculated roughness indices included random roughness, variogram sill and range, fractal dimension and fractal length using a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) model, variance and correlation length according to a Markov-Gaussian model, and fractal dimension using the RTPM. Random roughness is shown to be the best estimator to significantly distinguish soil surface roughness classes. When taking spatial dependency into account, the variogram sill was the best alternative. The fractal dimension calculated from the fBm model did not yield good results, as only short-range variations were incorporated. The MG variance described the large-scale roughness better than the parameters of the fBm model did. The fractal dimension from the RTPM performed well, although it could not significantly discriminate between all roughness classes. Since it covered a greater range of scales, we believe that it is a good estimator of the overall roughness...|$|E
40|$|Particle Image Velocimetry {{measurements}} were {{obtained in the}} highly unsteady turbulent flow issuing from a triangular <b>oscillating</b> jet (TOJ) <b>nozzle</b> into a fluid of different density. The TOJ nozzle comprises a triangular jet partially confined within an axi-symmetric chamber that produces a large-scale flow oscillation which is analogous {{to that in a}} precessing jet nozzle previously investigated. The initial spreading angle of the emerging jet was found to depend upon the density ratio, but in a more complex and different way to that of an unconfined jet. Instead, an increase in the density ratio of the jet fluid to the surroundings is found to be analogous to a decrease in the ratio of the nozzle length to diameter...|$|R
40|$|The nozzle {{oscillation}} {{technique was}} shown recently {{to enhance the}} performance of Abrasive Water Jet (AWJ) cutting. However, the fundamental reasons behind these process improvements have not been well established. In addition, presently available models of AWJ cutting, which are used for predicting depth of cut and, in some cases, surface quality are not capable of tackling the nozzle oscillation technique. The paper presents a semi-empirical model {{that can be used}} for predicting the maximum depth of cut in both oscillation and normal cutting processes. The model was constructed by integrating the results of a visualisation and parametric experimental study of the AWJ cutting process that compares the nozzle oscillation technique with conventional AWJ cutting to the theoretical potential of the cutting process. The experimental results for ductile materials processing show that by <b>oscillating</b> the <b>nozzle</b> during cutting at relatively small angle and high frequencies of oscillation, the efficiency of the erosion process is appreciably increased. At the optimum, oscillation parameter settings, about 30 % improvements in performance were obtained for oscillation cutting of mild steel compared to normal cutting samples, while the level of improvement that was found for aluminium samples were about 20 %. Outside this optimum range, the process performance for nozzle oscillation was found to be worse than normal cutting...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{near field}} data were {{collected}} with model single and twin jet nozzles to determine if closely spaced nozzles produce higher acoustic loading than do single nozzles. The tests were spurred by structural failure of the B- 1 exhaust nozzle external flaps and similar damage on the F- 15. The test was performed using two 5 / 8 in. ID pipes machined and placed side-by-side to mimic B- 1 nozzles. A microphone mounted on the internozzle fairing measured acoustic levels near the nozzle exit plane. The <b>nozzles</b> <b>oscillated</b> significantly more than did a single nozzle {{over a wide range}} of nozzle pressure ratios. Acoustic levels in the dual jets exceeded single jet noise by as much as 20 dB, making acoustic resonance a definite candidate for structural damage in the twin jet configuration...|$|R
40|$|This study aims at {{identifying}} {{the influence of}} soil surface roughness from small to large aggregates (random roughness) on runoff and soil loss and to investigate the interaction with soil surface seal formation. Bulk samples of a silty clay loam soil were sieved to four aggregate-size classes of 3 to 12, 12 to 20, 20 to 45, 45 to 100 mm, and packed in soil trays set at a 5 % slope. Rainfall simulations using an <b>oscillating</b> <b>nozzle</b> simulator were conducted for 90 min at an average rainfall intensity of 50. 2 mm h(- 1). Soil surface roughness was measured using an instantaneous profile laser scanner and surface sealing was studied by macroscopic analysis of epoxy impregnated soil samples. The rainfall simulations revealed longer times to initiate runoff with increasing soil surface roughness. For random roughness levels up to 6 mm, a decrease in final runoff rate with increasing roughness was observed. This {{can be attributed to}} a decreased breakdown of the larger roughness elements on rougher surfaces, thus keeping infiltration rate high. For a random roughness larger than 6 mm, a greater final runoff rate was observed. This was caused by the creation of a thick depositional seal in the concentrated flow areas, thus lowering the infiltration rates. Analysis of impregnated soil sample blocks confirmed the formation of a structural surface seal on smooth surfaces, whereas thick depositional seals were visible in the depressional areas of rougher surfaces. Therefore, from our observations it can be learned that soil surface roughness as formed by the presence of different aggregate sizes reduces runoff but that its effect diminishes due to aggregate breakdown and the formation of thick depositional seals in the case of rough soil surfaces. Sediment concentration increased with increasing soil surface roughness, due to runoff concentration in flow paths. Nevertheless, final soil loss rates were comparable for all soil roughness categories, indicating that random roughness is only important in influencing runoff rates and the time to initiate runoff, but not in influencing sediment export through soil loss rates...|$|E
40|$|Three-Dimensional Printing (3 DPTM) is a rapid-manufacturing process {{originally}} developed at MIT for building parts directly from CAD-generated models. Parts are fabricated in "slices" {{by creating a}} complete layer of powder and then selectively joining powder particles with a polymer binder deposited using a moving printhead. Traditional 3 DPTM builds layers by spreading dry powder and prints binder using a rastering scheme with a continuous-jet printhead. For smaller parts and greater accuracy, {{a variation on the}} process called slurry 3 DPTM (s 3 DPTM) uses raster-built slurry layers and a vector-printing scheme with a drop on demand (DoD) printhead. This here thesis presents efforts to improve core technology in both dry-powder 3 DPTM and slurry 3 DPTM. One of the most critical steps in s 3 DPTM is the building of the slurry layers. To avoid intra- and interlayer defects the slurry layer must be rastered at high deposition rates to promote line merging and better layer quality. The difficulty lies in the design of a machine capable of <b>oscillating</b> the slurry <b>nozzle</b> at the required frequencies. Fortunately, such a design was completed and the machine built as part of a collaborative effort with TDK Japan to build an s 3 DPTM machine for manufacturing small parts. The design uses a reciprocating countermass strategy to recycle mechanical energy and eliminate troublesome vibrations. A general overview of this slurry layer forming station (LFS) is given, along with an in-depth treatment of several components, including the forcers, centering system, and interface software. And speaking of rastering, dry-powder 3 DPTM relies on this strategy for printing binder, just as the LFS uses a raster method to build powder layers. Beginning with observations made during the design of the LFS, the fluid-handling system was redesigned to improve binder droplet stream stability during the carriage traverse and turnaround. The improvement was made possible by repositioning a smaller version of the "Clamshell" constant pressure vessel used to set the fluid flow rate to the printhead carriage itself and using a closed-loop control system to maintain a constant fluid level in the Clamshell. Drawings, parts lists, schematic diagrams, and assembly instructions are included for building additional fluid control systems. by David C. Ables. Thesis (S. M.)
