5|$|Ancient texts use ahimsa to mean non-injury, {{a broader}} concept than non-violence. Non-injury implies not killing others, {{as well as}} not hurting others mentally or verbally; it {{includes}} avoiding all violent means—including physical violence—anything that injures others. In classical Sanskrit literature of Hinduism, another word Adrohi is sometimes used instead of Ahimsa, {{as one of the}} cardinal virtues necessary for moral life. One example is in Baudhayana Dharmasutra 2.6.23: वाङ्-मनः-कर्म-दण्डैर् भूतानाम् अद्रोही (One who does not injure <b>others</b> <b>with</b> words, thoughts or acts is named Adrohi).|$|E
