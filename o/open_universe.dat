2500|$|Hawking did {{not rule}} out the {{existence}} of a Creator, asking in A Brief History of Time [...] "Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence?" [...] In his early work, Hawking spoke of God in a metaphorical sense. In A Brief History of Time he wrote: [...] "If we discover a complete theory, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reasonfor then we should know the mind of God." [...] In the same book he suggested that the existence of God was not necessary to explain the origin of the universe. Later discussions with Neil Turok led to the realisation that the existence of God was also compatible with an <b>open</b> <b>universe.</b>|$|E

40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{developments}} in inflationary cosmology indicating the possibility of obtaining genuinely <b>open</b> <b>universes</b> in some models, we compare the predictions of Cold Dark Matter models in <b>open</b> <b>universes</b> {{with a variety of}} observational information.

We normalize the power spectrum using the recent analysis of the two year COBE DMR data by Gorski et al. (1995). We then consider a variety of observations, namely the galaxy correlation function, bulk flows, the abundance of galaxy clusters and the abundance of damped Lyman alpha systems. For the last two of these, we provide a new treatment appropriate to <b>open</b> <b>universes.</b> We find that if one allows an arbitrary h, then a good fit is available for any Ω_ 0 greater than 0. 35, though for Ω_ 0 close to one the required h is alarmingly low.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the effect of {{gravitational}} lensing on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy in flat and <b>open</b> <b>universes.</b> We develop a formalism to calculate the changes on the radiation power spectrum induced by lensing in the Newtonian and synchronous-comoving gauges. The previously considered negligible contribution to the CMB radiation power spectrum of the anisotropic term of the lensing correlation is shown to be appreciable. However, considering the nonlinear evolution of the matter power spectrum produces only slight differences on the results based on linear evolution. The general conclusion for flat as well as <b>open</b> <b>universes</b> is that lensing slightly smoothes the radiation power spectrum.

40|$|We {{consider}} space-times {{with two}} isometries which represent gravitational waves with distinct wavefronts which propagate into exact Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universes. The geometry of possible wavefronts is analysed {{in detail in}} all three types of FRW models. In the spatially flat and <b>open</b> <b>universes,</b> the wavefronts can be planar or cylindrical; in the closed case they are toroidal. Exact solutions are given which describe gravitational waves propagating into the FRW universes with a fluid with a stiff equation of state. It is shown that the plane-fronted waves may include impulsive or step (shock) components, while the cylindrical waves in the spatially flat and <b>open</b> <b>universes</b> and the toroidal waves in closed universes may contain steps.

40|$|In {{the context}} of a {{recently}} proposed nonlinear massive gravity with Lorentz-invariant mass terms, we investigate <b>open</b> Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) <b>universes</b> driven by arbitrary matter source. While the flat FRW solutions were recently shown to be absent, the proof does not extend to the <b>open</b> <b>universes.</b> We find three independent branches of solutions to the equations of motion for the Stückelberg scalars. One of the branches does not allow any nontrivial FRW cosmologies, as in the previous no-go result. On the other hand, both of the other two branches allow general <b>open</b> FRW <b>universes</b> governed by the Friedmann equation with the matter source, the standard curvature term and an effective cosmological constant Λ_±=c_±m_g^ 2. Here, m_g is the graviton mass, +and - represent the two branches, and c_± are constants determined by the two dimensionless parameters of the theory. Since an <b>open</b> FRW <b>universe</b> with a sufficiently small curvature constant can approximate a flat FRW universe but there is no exactly flat FRW solution, the theory exhibits a discontinuity at the flat FRW limit.
