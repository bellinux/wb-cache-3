40|$|It is very {{important}} to understand the mechanical response <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> under deformation since their aesthetic properties and performance are directly related to their mechanical properties, such as tensile, bending and shear. During use, fabric is always stressed by these kinds <b>of</b> deformations. <b>Fabric</b> properties such as drape, handle, and bagging are also aected by the bending and shear characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>fabric.</b> Thus, this study was carried out {{to gain a better understanding}} of the bending and shear behavior <b>of</b> knitted <b>fabric.</b> The eects <b>of</b> several factors such as tightness factor, relaxation treatment and the direction of bending and shear on the response <b>of</b> <b>fabric</b> under deformation are discussed. The results indicate that the increase in the tightness factor and relaxation <b>of</b> the <b>fabric</b> generally lead to an increase in rigidity fabric against bending and shear deformation.

40|$|In this paper, a {{purpose-built}} apparatus {{was used}} to analyze the moisture liberation <b>of</b> textile <b>fabrics.</b> Fabrics were wetted and placed in an air-conditioned room to test the variation of weight and surface temperature during the process of moisture liberation. Effects of textile materials and fabric structures on the velocities of moisture liberation <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> were analyzed; the temperature variation and its relationship with moisture regains <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> in the moisture liberation were also studied. Moisture liberation velocities of polyester and silk fabrics are much higher than that of wool and cotton fabrics. For the same textile materials, knitted fabrics absorbed more water and thus took longer time to liberate the water. The surface temperature <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> showed three stages during moisture liberation. With the decrease <b>of</b> moisture regain, <b>fabric</b> temperature decreased gradually and jumped quickly to ambient temperature. In this way we could evaluate the moisture desorption <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> and develop quick-drying fabrics with improved moisture and thermal properties. ...|$|R

The most common method for having such clean fabric surface is the removal of protruding (floating) fiber from the surface <b>of</b> the <b>fabric.</b> Many studies have proved that enzymatic treatment, commonly called biopolishing, removes the floating fibers from the surface <b>of</b> <b>fabric</b> and gives a smooth surface to the fabric. This study is an effort to assess and measure the impact of biopolishing <b>of</b> knitted <b>fabric</b> through objective and subjective evaluation on warm-cool feeling <b>of</b> <b>fabric</b> because <b>of</b> change in surface profile <b>of</b> the <b>fabric.</b> For testing purposes, 31 knitted <b>fabric</b> samples <b>of</b> various kinds were produced.
