5|$|<b>Okay</b> Africa {{wrote that}} by its second year, the fair had become Europe's {{foremost}} contemporary African art fair, and Naomi Rea of Artnet News {{called it a}} necessary visit during the London Frieze Art Fair. In New York, Ben Davis of Artnet wrote that 1:54 NY was a highlight of the city's art fair week. Critics had typically questioned whether art fairs with narrow geographic scope like 1:54 highlight or ostracize minority artists. A gallery owner from Seattle saw the fair as a route for further integration into larger markets. Artnet Davis expressed distaste at the art fair trend of lumping artists by their geographic region and generalizing trends based on its parts, but nonetheless considered important 1:54's representation of Africa. Critics initially noted the fair's lack of African gallery representation, but cited justification including the African art scene's nascent state and the continent's history of political instability, which affects both overseas trade and gallery security. At the 2015 New York show, reviewers noted elements including the predominantly white gallery exhibition staff and the marquee display of a popular artist at a fair for marginal artists.|$|E
