60|$|I was {{fortunate}} enough to find a disengaged omnibus, and filled it with our rugs and smaller belongings. Then we made <b>our</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>back</b> to the little space prepared for the reception of the heavier baggage, and around which a barrier had already been erected. There was a slight nervousness in my companion's manner which made conversation difficult. I, too, could not help feeling that the situation was a difficult one for her.|$|R

50|$|In {{the annals}} of history, the first {{inhabitants}} LABO were the Subanons. These Tribal Groups partly shaped our humble beginnings that of being a healthy Barangay. They owned big tracks of land which should have been fortunately handed down to their children, but because of fear and ignorance, they're forced to barter their lands to the new settlers with bolos, carpentry tools, and farm implements. They were forced to move out into the hinterlands where they have new farms and established a healthy and happy family. Bloodlines tells us that we inherited <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> tracing <b>back</b> to <b>our</b> forefathers. The Subanons, the healthy Filipino generation.|$|R

They have either been saved or are beyond the reach of help. This sounds harsh, Grace, but it is no harsher than the fact. Had we stayed, we would, without helping them, have only shared their fate. I might have been in your brother's place, you in your sister's. It is our fortune, not our fault, that we are not dying with them. It has been willed that you and I should be saved. It might have been willed that we should have perished in our attempts to succour them, and that relief which came to them would have never reached us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We made <b>our</b> <b>way,</b> by <b>back</b> {{passages}} {{known to}} us, to the princess's apartments, where she, with several knights and ladies, among them {{my mother and}} sister, were {{waiting to see what}} might come. Sir Robert Hales rushed in and prayed that no resistance be offered, as this would inflame the passions of the mob, and cost the lives of all within the Tower. So the princess gave orders for all to leave her save her maids, and to scatter to their own apartments, and remain quiet there. As soon as we reached my mother's room we besought her to put on that sombre dress, and prayed her similarly to attire Aline, so that they might pass with us unnoticed through the crowd. While they were doing this we went up to the platform above, and there witnessed the murder of the archbishop, treasurer, and priest--at least, Edgar did so, for I could not bring myself to witness so horrible a sight.|$|R
60|$|But {{the hour}} wanes while we stand and admire; the surf dashes nearer and nearer to our feet; soon, the sea {{will cover the}} sand, and rush swiftly into the caves where we have slowly crawled. Already the Devil's Bellows is at work--the jets of spray spout forth from it with a roar. The sea thunders louder and louder in the Devil's Throat--we must gain the cliffs while we have yet time. The guide takes his leave; my {{companion}} unwillingly closes his sketch-book; and we slowly ascend on <b>our</b> inland <b>way</b> together--looking <b>back</b> often and often, with no feigned regret, on all that we are leaving behind us at KYNANCE COVE.|$|R

6000|$|It is {{the amazing}} and {{distressful}} discovery of every believer so {{soon as the}} first exaltation of belief is past, that one does not remain always in touch with God. At first it seems incredible that one should ever have any motive again that is not also God's motive. Then one finds oneself caught unawares by a base impulse. We discover that discontinuousness of our apparently homogeneous selves, the unincorporated and warring elements that seemed at first altogether absent from the synthesis of conversion. We are tripped up by forgetfulness, by distraction, by old habits, by tricks of appearance. There come dull patches of existence; those mysterious obliterations of one's finer sense that are due at times to the little minor poisons one eats or drinks, to phases of fatigue, ill-health and bodily disorder, or one is betrayed by some unanticipated storm of emotion, brewed deep in the animal being and released by any trifling accident, such as personal jealousy or lust, or one is relaxed by contentment into vanity. All these rebel forces of our ill-coordinated selves, all these [...] "disharmonies," [...] of the inner being, snatch us away from our devotion to God's service, carry us off to follies, offences, unkindness, waste, and leave us compromised, involved, and regretful, perplexed by a hundred difficulties we have put in <b>our</b> own <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to God.|$|R
6000|$|After our {{fortunate}} {{escape from}} the clutches of our too-admiring Tibetan hosts, we wound <b>our</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>back</b> through the Maharajah's territory towards Sir Ivor's headquarters. On the third day out from the lamasery we camped in a romantic Himalayan valley--a narrow, green glen, with a brawling stream running in white cataracts and rapids down its midst. We were able to breathe freely now; we could enjoy the great tapering deodars that rose in ranks on the hillsides, the snow-clad needles of ramping rock that bounded the view to north and south, the feathery bamboo-jungle that fringed and half-obscured the mountain torrent, whose cool music--alas, fallaciously cool--was borne to us through the dense screen of waving foliage. Lady Meadowcroft was so delighted at having got clear away from those murderous and saintly Tibetans {{that for a while}} she almost forgot to grumble. She even condescended to admire the deep-cleft ravine in which we bivouacked for the night, and to admit that the orchids which hung from the tall trees were as fine as any at her florist's in Piccadilly. [...] "Though how they can have got them out here already, in this outlandish place--the most fashionable kinds--when we in England have to grow them with such care in expensive hot-houses," [...] she said, [...] "really passes my comprehension." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Way</b> <b>back</b> in 1984 and 85, when Martin Eric Ain and I {{recorded}} Celtic Frost's {{first two}} albums Morbid Tales and To Mega Therion, Hellhammer lasted on us {{almost like a}} curse. Even though Hellhammer was the very reason we had thought over our goals and conceived the Frost, HH's left-overs kept being mighty rocks in <b>our</b> <b>way.</b> Many voices saw Frost as the same band with just a name-change. The lack of musical quality in HH made it almost impossible {{for us to get}} an unbiased reaction for Frost. To make a long story short, it almost killed all our work and dreams.|$|R

60|$|September 7th.--On Wednesday, {{just before}} dusk, J----- and I walked forth, {{for the first}} time, in London. Our lodgings are in George Street, Hanover Square, No. 21; and St. George's Church, where so many marriages in romance and in fashionable life have been celebrated, is a short {{distance}} below our house, in the same street. The edifice seems to be of white marble, now much blackened with London smoke, and has a Grecian pillared portico. In the square, just above us, is a statue of William Pitt. We went down Bond Street, and part of Regent Street, just estraying a little <b>way</b> from <b>our</b> temporary nest, and taking good account of landmarks and corners, so as to find <b>our</b> <b>way</b> readily <b>back</b> again. It is long since I have had such a childish feeling; but all that I had heard and felt about the vastness of London made it seem like swimming in a boundless ocean, to venture one step beyond the only spot I knew. My first actual impression of London was of stately and spacious streets, and by no means so dusky and grimy as I had expected,--not merely in the streets about this quarter of the town, which is the aristocratic quarter, but in all the streets through which we had passed from the railway station. If I had not first been so imbued with the smoke and dinginess of Liverpool, I should doubtless have seen a stronger contrast betwixt dusky London and the cheerful glare of our American cities. There are no red bricks here; all are of a dark hue, and whatever of stone or stucco has been white soon clothes itself in mourning.|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked up}} where I pointed with a hasty glance, {{and then made}} her <b>way</b> <b>back</b> again quickly to the staircase. As we hurried out, the timbers of the stage were {{beginning}} to fall in, and the engines were already playing fiercely upon the raging flames. I {{took her hand and}} almost dragged her out into the open. When we reached the Strand, we were both wet through, and terribly blackened with smoke and ashes. Pushing <b>our</b> <b>way</b> through the dense crowd, I called a hansom. She jumped in lightly. [...] "Thank you so much," [...] she said, quite carelessly. [...] "Will you kindly tell him where to drive? Twenty-seven, Seymour Crescent." ...|$|R
50|$|An {{addition}} to the label in this period was Negative Approach. Marking the label's 200th release was their work Friends of No One, a lost six-song recording from 1984 that was discovered in 2009 in a basement in Detroit. Taang!'s next released Nothing Will Stand In <b>Our</b> <b>Way,</b> a full album by the band, which focused on its earliest recordings (a total of 53 songs). In 2011 the label released works by two legendary bands from the San Francisco Bay area - Attitude Adjustment and Part Time Christians. Both releases contained the bands' complete recorded works and were released digitally {{as well as on}} vinyl editions.Attitude Adjustment released a new recording entitled No <b>Way</b> <b>Back</b> in 2012.|$|R
