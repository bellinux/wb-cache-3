500|$|Ptitim is an Israeli pasta {{which now}} comes in many shapes, {{including}} pearls, loops, stars and hearts, but was originally shaped like grains of rice. It {{originated in the}} early days of the State of Israel as a wheat-based substitute for rice, when rice, a staple of the Mizrahi Jews, was scarce. Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, is reputed to have asked the Osem company to devise this substitute, and it was thus nicknamed [...] "Ben-Gurion rice". Ptitim can be boiled like pasta, prepared pilaf-style by sautéing and then boiling in water or stock, or baked in a casserole.

40|$|Barilla is an {{international}} producer of pasta with locations in nine different countries. The production facility {{we are working with}} is located in Ames, Iowa.

The problem Barilla is having is pasta is being spilled somewhere during the process of moving along conveyors and buckets while being transported from production to the storage silos. Barilla is striving {{to reduce the amount of}} waste they experience through spillage. The main loss comes when they get mixed product in a silo and are forced to scrap the whole silo. Barilla is not sure exactly what is causing the spillages and want to know if the losses can be reduced or eliminated completely. Reducing the amount of spilled pasta would save Barilla money in waste and delayed production.

40|$|PonA 2 {{is one of}} the two class A Penicillin binding {{proteins}} of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the {{etiologic agent}} of tuberculosis. It plays a c omplex role in mycobacterial physiology and is spotted as a promising target for inhibitors. PonA 2 is involved in adaptation of M. tuberculosis to dormancy, an ability which has been attributed to the presence in its sequence of a C 6 terminal PASTA domain. Since PASTA modules are ty pically considered as ?? 6 lactam antibiotic binding domains, we determined the solution structu re of the PASTA domain from PonA 2 and analysed its binding properties versus a plethora of potential binders, including the ?? 6 l actam antibiotics, two typical muropeptide mimics and pol ymeric peptidoglycan. We show that, despite a high structural similarity with <b>other</b> <b>PASTA</b> domains, the PASTA domain of PonA 2 displays different binding properties, as it is not able to bind muropeptides, nor ?? 6 lactams, nor polymeric peptidoglycan. These results indicate that the role of PASTA domains cannot be generalized, as their specific binding properties strongly depend o n surface residues, which are widely variable...|$|E
40|$|There is no {{information}} {{on the effect of}} sulfuryl fluoride (SF) on durum wheat technological properties and products made from fumigated durum wheat. Durum wheat and semolina were exposed to a range of SF applications under conditions that might be typically encountered in bulk storage facilities used in many countries. SF greatly reduced the germination percentage of fumigated durum wheat, with increasing impact under higher SF concentration, grain moisture content, and fumigation temperature. SF greatly reduced seed germination percentage, impacting more the higher the SF concentration. SF had little to no effect on grain test weight, 1, 000 -grain weight, hardness, protein content, semolina ash content, and mixograph properties. At the highest SF concentration (31. 25 mg/L for 48 h) there was a tendency for pasta cooking loss to be increased but still acceptable, and <b>other</b> <b>pasta</b> properties were largely unaffected. Fumigation with SF did not have any impact on the baking properties of a wholemeal durum flour-commercial flour mix. Therefore, SF is not recommended if the grains are to be used as seeds for agricultural production, but for the production of semolina, pasta, and bread, SF used under typical fumigation conditions has little to no impact on technological properties of durum wheat. © 2016 AACC International, Inc...|$|E
