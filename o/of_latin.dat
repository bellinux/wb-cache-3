Commonalities in syntax and vocabulary facilitated the adoption <b>of</b> <b>Latin.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1870 Wilhelm Sigismund Teuffel in Geschichte der Römischen Literatur (A History of Roman Literature) innovated the {{definitive}} philological classification <b>of</b> classical <b>Latin</b> {{based on the}} metaphoric uses of the ancient myth of the Ages of Man, a practice then universally current: a Golden Age and a Silver Age <b>of</b> classical <b>Latin</b> were to be presumed. The practice and Teuffel's classification, with modifications, are still in use. His work was translated into English as soon as published in German by Wilhelm Wagner, who corresponded with Teuffel. Wagner published the English translation in 1873. Teuffel divides the chronology <b>of</b> classical <b>Latin</b> authors into several periods according to political events, rather than by style. Regarding the style <b>of</b> the literary <b>Latin</b> <b>of</b> those periods he had but few comments.|$|R
