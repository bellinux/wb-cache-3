40|$|The {{recycling}} and processing uncured prepreg <b>offcuts</b> of carbon fibre-reinforced thermosetting resin involves: a) removing the protective film from the pre-preg and cutting the <b>offcuts</b> into smaller pieces; b) passing the <b>offcuts</b> through a cutting mill at 20 deg. C below the {{glass transition temperature}} of the uncured resin; c) placing the milled recycled material on a carrier and processing in a pressing or autoclaving process to cure the resin. A claimed plate moulded in the recycled material after removal of the carrier film has a density of 0. 7 - 0. 8 g/ cm 3, tensile strength of 80 MPa and a bending stiffness of 140 MPa in a three point bending test. A similar plate moulded in the same material together with the carrier film has a density of 1. 2 g/cm 3, tensile strength of 100 MPa and bending stiffness of 190 MPa. USE - The process is for recycling carbon fibre-reinforced prepreg <b>offcuts</b> occuring especially in the aerospace industry. ADVANTAGE - The prepreg structure is largely retained so th at products moulded in the recycled materials still have high physical properties...|$|R

50|$|However, the {{information}} {{used to make}} the decision on whether the <b>offcut</b> matched or not {{has been found to be}} inaccurate. The reason given by Heritage Victoria was that Joe's suit contained large amounts of lead, and the piece found in the bush contains no lead, so they cannot be the same. The test results from Ansto clearly state that the lead found on Joes suit was from a bullet impact, made after World War I. The bullet impression contains lead, tin and tungsten. Tungsten was only used post World War I in ballistics. The metal piece found in the bush contains no lead because it was removed from the suit, using a chisel, which has also been recovered, prior to being worn at Glenrowan. The breastplate was too long and impeded Joe's movement, and probably prevented him easily mounting a horse, or walking freely. Further testing, and analysis of previous test results is now being undertaken independently, and the results will be published some time between August and October 2010.|$|E
5000|$|Potter {{was first}} {{discovered}} lurking among the mossy rocks and echoing grottoes of the Forest of Dean, fit backdrop, he explained, {{to introduce a}} play full of [...] "the stonily mysterious landscapes of both my own childhood and all our fairytale-ridden memories." [...] He urged us lullingly {{into the world of}} dream: [...] "Cast your mind back to the dusky evenings of childhood. Your eyelids are drooping ... the warm, cosy house is preparing itself to drift off, unanchored, into the night ... the realm of once upon a time." [...] Megaliths and memory, ferns and faerie: such was the world of Cymbeline. Elijah Moshinsky, the director, obviously hadn't heard. Faerie was out; rocks were off; stonily mysterious landscapes could get stuffed. Ancient Britain in the reign of Augustus Caesar became a foppish 17th-century court, with nods to Rembrandt, Van Dyck and (when Helen Mirren was caught in a certain light and a certain dress) Vermeer. The fairytale Mr Potter had promised became a play of court intrigue and modern passion: a sort of <b>offcut</b> from Othello.|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{germanium}} (Ge) epitaxial films grown directly on silicon (Si) (001) with 0 ° and 6 ° <b>offcut</b> orientation using a reduced-pressure {{chemical vapor deposition}} system is studied and compared. Ge film grown on Si (001) with 6 ° <b>offcut</b> presents ∼ 65 % higher threading dislocation density and higher root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness (1. 92 nm versus 0. 98 nm) than Ge film grown on Si (001) with 0 ° <b>offcut.</b> Plan-view transmission electron microscopy also reveals that threading dislocations are more severe (in terms of contrast and density) for the 6 ° <b>offcut.</b> In addition, both high-resolution x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy analyses show that the Ge epilayer on 6 ° <b>offcut</b> wafer presents higher tensile strain.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Cutting {{operations}} using blades {{appear in}} several different industries such as food processing, surgical operations, gardening equipment, and so forth. As our society continues to increase our technological prowess, there is an ongoing need {{to better understand the}} underlying causes of simple tasks such as cutting so that cutting operations can be performed with more precision and accuracy than ever before. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the effects of wedge angle and <b>offcut</b> thickness while including slicing motions. The approach taken in this paper is to create a novel test machine that properly captures the motions typically seen in cutting operations and to create an analytical model to help explain what is seen in the experiments. Data collected by this device is used to investigate the effects of the slice to push ratio, wedge angle, and <b>offcut</b> thickness on cutting force. The analytical model presented in this paper looks at slice to push in a 3 D approach to better capture the cutting process than previous attempts in the literature. The experimental data and derived equations shown in this body of work helps to illustrate the effect of wedge angle and <b>offcut</b> thickness while including relative motion of the blade edge to the work material. Both show that an increase in the slice to push ratio decreases the vertical cutting force and increases the horizontal cutting force. This relationship essentially lowers the overall resultant cutting force when there is an increase in the slice to push ratio. The effect of the slice to push ratio is similar at all wedge angles and offcuts tested, which indicates that increasing the slice to push ratio will always decrease the cutting force regardless of the wedge angle or <b>offcut</b> thickness...|$|E
