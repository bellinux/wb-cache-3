5|$|Mahan went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> victory {{could only}} be {{achieved}} by engagements between battleships, which {{came to be known}} as the decisive battle doctrine in some navies, while targeting merchant ships (commerce raiding or guerre de course, as posited by the Jeune École) could never succeed.|$|E

5|$|The Hindi poet Mahadevi Verma said {{commenting on}} Tulsidas {{that in the}} {{turbulent}} Middle Ages, India got light from Tulsidas. She further went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the Indian society as it exists today is an edifice built by Tulsidas, and the Rama as we know today is the Rama of Tulsidas.|$|E
5|$|Ghomeshi, in {{introducing}} the band, mentioned the acting credentials of Thornton, but never based his questions to Thornton about his show business career. Thornton went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Canadian audiences were generally reserved {{and that the}} band was used to playing in places where people move around and throw things at each other. He then added, 'it's like mashed potatoes with no gravy.' This caused an outpouring of criticism from across Canada {{and around the world}} for the star's behavior.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, Pakistani {{media reports}} {{suggested}} that export orders {{have also been}} confirmed and signed with the Sri Lanka Air Force, according to Pakistan-based 92 News while some other sources claim that Myanmar is the first buyer of Pakistani JF-17 Thunder jets. The article goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that deliveries are likely to begin in 2017. According to the report, the order will be for around 18–24 aircraft, potentially confirming claims made at the 51st Paris Air Show that the first contract {{for the sale of}} the JF-17 had been signed with the Sri Lanka Air Force.|$|E

5|$|The book {{begins by}} looking at religion, {{specifically}} God as non-being and as being, put by Stace as the negative and positive divine. Stace then defines two orders of being - time and eternity, which he says intersect {{in the moment of}} mystic illumination. He goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the nature of God or eternity is such that all religious language is symbolic and that it is necessarily subject to contradictions.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposition}} to the ritual is not explicit in the oldest Upanishads. On occasions, the Upanishads extend {{the task of the}} Aranyakas by making the ritual allegorical and giving it a philosophical meaning. For example, the Brihadaranyaka interprets the practice of horse-sacrifice or ashvamedha allegorically. It states that the over-lordship of the earth may be acquired by sacrificing a horse. It then goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that spiritual autonomy can only be achieved by renouncing the universe which is conceived in the image of a horse.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Canadian Gaming Association {{commissioned}} {{an opinion}} on the legality of DFS in Canada from former Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario general counsel Don Bourgeois. He determined that DFS would likely be classified as a game of chance under Canadian law, going <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{in an interview that}} under the Criminal Code of Canada, games that mix chance- and skill-based elements are considered games of chance. However, Canadian authorities have not yet targeted DFS services; historically, the government has only targeted illegal gambling operations that have a presence within the country. While the service Sport Select offers legal sports wagering games through Canada's lotteries, it is subject to a legal prohibition on wagering on individual sporting events.|$|E

5|$|Isabeau was {{dismissed}} by historians as a wanton, weak and indecisive leader. Modern historians now {{see her as}} taking an unusually active leadership role for a queen of her period, forced to take responsibility {{as a direct result}} of Charles' illness. Her critics accepted skewed interpretations of her role in the negotiations with England, resulting in the Treaty of Troyes, and in the rumors of her marital infidelity with Orléans. Gibbons writes that a queen's duty was to secure the succession to the crown and look after her husband; historians described Isabeau as having failed in both respects, and she came to be seen as one of the great villains of history. Gibbons goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that even her physical appearance is uncertain; depictions of her vary depending on whether she was to be portrayed as good or evil.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{wanted to}} introduce a new talent agency that would be separate from 765 Pro to better suit {{the details of the}} story, such as how the idols at 876 Pro are just starting out while the idols at 765 Pro already have an establish fanbase. Tanaka would go <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the scenario in Dearly Stars would not have worked without having a different company president—in this case, the president of 876 Pro, Minori Ishikawa. The gameplay was adjusted to allow the player the option to quickly play through the game's story. However, Kujioka also wanted to add in gameplay elements that would add another layer of challenge, such as the introduction of the choreography panel to make adjustments to an idol's dance sequence or the positioning and manipulation of in-game cameras. The staff also altered how the lessons and auditions operate in Dearly Stars compared to previous games in the series, which also modified the game's degree of difficulty.|$|E
5|$|The second {{presentation}} {{was given by}} a representative of Scout Moor Wind Farm, who argued the need for Britain to produce clean green power without harmful emissions, to counter the increasing dangers of global warming. He went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the UK has fewer wind farms than other major industrial countries in Europe, {{even though it is}} a windier country, and that North West England has a particularly poor record, with only 1.3% of electricity generated from renewable energy. Following this meeting the campaign to oppose the proposal gathered momentum, and in November 2003 a protest was held on the moor, led by environmental campaigner Professor David Bellamy.|$|E

5000|$|When feminists {{tried to}} enter the sanctum of Shani Shingnapur temple, Ahmednagar, Maharashtra, in January 2016, Swami Swaroopanand stated, [...] "Shani is a kroor (cruel) graha, hence women should beware of {{worshiping}} the deity. Since the effect of Shani is harmful for women, they should be away from the deity.". Swami Swaroopanand even went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> that the entry of women into Shani Shingnapur temple {{will lead to more}} rapes.|$|R
5|$|After Victory Road, Cage befriended the {{new number}} one {{contender}} Sting on the July 27, 2006 episode of Impact!, by asking for forgiveness for doubting Sting's agenda by coming to TNA in January of that year. He went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that he had}} asked Jim Cornette the week before if {{he could be in}} Sting's corner in his match with Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event, but had told him he needed Sting's approval. Sting accepted Cage's offer, with interviewer and occasional ring announcer Jeremy Borash announcing Sting's decision in a backstage segment on the August 3, 2006 episode of Impact!. On August 13, 2006, Cage was in Sting's corner at Hard Justice as he faced Jarrett, with Scott Steiner in his corner, for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. During the contest, Cage interfered to help Sting win numerous times, as did Steiner for Jarrett, until Cage turned on Sting by taking Jarrett's signature guitar and bashing it over his head—changing his character from a face to a heel. He then allowed Jarrett to pin Sting and retain the title.|$|E
5|$|The {{command of}} the German V Corps, trapped with the IX Army north of Forst, passed from the IV Panzer Army to the IX Army. The corps was still {{holding on to the}} Berlin-Cottbus highway front line. Field Marshal Ferdinand Schörner's Army Group Centre {{launched}} a counter-offensive aimed at breaking through to Berlin from the south and making a successful initial incursion (the Battle of Bautzen) in the 1st Ukrainian Front region, engaging the 2nd Polish Army and elements of the Red Army's 52nd Army and 5th Guards Army. When the old southern flank of the IV Panzer Army had some local successes counter-attacking north against the 1st Ukrainian Front, Hitler gave orders that showed his grasp of military reality was completely gone. He ordered the IX Army to hold Cottbus and set up a front facing west. Then they were to attack the Soviet columns advancing north. This would supposedly allow them to form a northern pincer that would meet the IV Panzer Army coming from the south and envelop the 1st Ukrainian Front before destroying it. They were to anticipate a southward attack by the III Panzer Army and be ready to be the southern arm of a pincer attack that would envelop 1st Belorussian Front, which would be destroyed by SS-General Felix Steiner's Army Detachment advancing from north of Berlin. Later in the day, when Steiner explained {{that he did not have}} the divisions to do this, Heinrici made it clear to Hitler's staff that unless the IX Army retreated immediately, it would be enveloped by the Soviets. He stressed that it was already too late for it to move north-west to Berlin and would have to retreat west. Heinrici went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that if Hitler did not allow it to move west, he would ask to be relieved of his command.|$|E
