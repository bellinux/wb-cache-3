40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{determine}} whether earnings announcements pose non-diversifiable volatility risk that commands a risk premium. We find that investors anticipate some earnings announcements to convey news that increases market return volatility and pay a premium to hedge this non-diversifiable risk. In particular, we find evidence of risk premiums embedded in prices of firms' traded options that are significantly positively associated with {{the extent to which}} the firms' earnings announcements pose non-diversifiable volatility risk. In addition, we find that volatility risk premiums are concentrated among bellwether firms and result in predictable variation in <b>option</b> <b>straddle</b> returns around earnings announcements. Taken together, our findings show that some earnings announcements pose non-diversifiable volatility risk that commands a risk premium...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{theory and}} {{evidence}} from US {{studies suggest that}} aggregate market volatility risk is a strong candidate {{for inclusion in the}} list of risk factors that earn a risk premium in equilibrium. We re-examine the sensitivity of stock returns to volatility risk using delta-neutral index <b>option</b> <b>straddles</b> to proxy for innovations in aggregate volatility. Contrary to existing US evidence, our analysis finds little evidence that volatility risk is priced in Australian equities. This finding is robust across a variety of methods for characterizing the underlying volatility factor. ...|$|R

40|$|We empirically {{study the}} {{economic}} beneÞts of giving investors access to index {{options in the}} context of the standard asset allocation problem. We solve the portfolio problem with a ßexible empirical methodology that does not rely on speciÞc assumptions about the process of the underlying equity index, and that can handle market frictions and a variety of preference speciÞcations. Using data on S&P 500 index options (1987 - 2001) we consider returns on OTM put <b>options</b> and ATM <b>straddles.</b> CRRA investors Þnd it always optimal to short put <b>options</b> and <b>straddles,</b> regardless of their risk aversion. The economic and statistical signiÞcance of the option positions is large and robust to corrections for transaction costs, margin requirements, and Peso problems. These results may be interpreted as evidence for a substantial negative volatility risk premium and a positive jump risk premium, in line with the recent option pricing literature. Many nonexpected utility investors (loss aversion, cumulative prospect theory and disappointment aversion) also optimally hold short positions in puts and straddles. Only for cumulative prospect theory, where loss aversion is combined with distorted probability assessments, can we obtain positive portfolio weights for put <b>options</b> and <b>straddles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Value at Risk (VaR) {{provides}} {{a number that}} measures {{the risk of a}} financial portfolio under significant loss. The Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful tool for estimating VaR. However, the Monte Carlo simulation is inefficient since the event of significant loss is usually rare. Glasserman et al. suggest that the performance can be improved by importance sampling [4, 5]. To be brief, they sample the stock prices from a new probability measure where the event of significant loss is more likely to happen than in the original one. However, their technique might perform poorly for some complex portfolios like shorting <b>straddle</b> <b>options.</b> Shorting <b>straddle</b> <b>options</b> suffers significant loss when there is a significant increase or decrease in the underlying stock price. Thus tilting the probability measure of the stock price to make one huge-loss event, says a significant decrease in the stock price, more likely to happen will make the other event (a significant increase in the stock price) much more rare. The hybrid importance sampling algorithm suggested in this paper can efficiently estimate the VaR for complex portfolios. Take shorting <b>straddle</b> <b>options</b> for example, our algorithm can be decomposed into two sub simulations. Each sub simulation focuses on one huge-loss event like the significant decrease (or increase) in the stock price and tilts the probability measure to asymptotically minimize the variance for estimating the probability of that event. We proceed to minimize the variance for estimating the probability of significant loss given a limit on total computational time. The number of stock price samples serves as a proxy of computational time and the allotment of samples to each sub simulation is then properly determined by Lagrange’s multiplier. Our paper will demonstrate how the hybrid importance sampling method is applied to estimate the VaR of shorting <b>straddle</b> <b>options</b> by assuming that the stock price follows the Merton’s jump diffusion process [7]. Numerical experiments are given to verify the superiority of our method...|$|R

50|$|A {{straddle}} involves {{buying a}} call and put with same strike price and expiration date. If the stock price {{is close to the}} strike price at expiration of the <b>options,</b> the <b>straddle</b> leads to a loss. However, if there is a sufficiently large move in either direction, a significant profit will result. A straddle is appropriate when an investor is expecting a large move in a stock price but does not know in which direction the move will be.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the use of GARCH models, Neural Network Regression (NNR), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) {{regression}} and model combinations for forecasting and trading currency volatility, with an application to the GBP/USD and USD/JPY exchange rates. Both {{the results of the}} NNR/RNN models and the model combination results are benchmarked against the simpler GARCH alternative. The idea of developing a nonlinear nonparametric approach to forecast FX volatility, identify mispriced options and subsequently develop a trading strategy based upon this process is intuitively appealing. Using daily data from December 1993 through April 1999, we develop alternative FX volatility forecasting models. These models are then tested out-of-sample over the period April 1999 -May 2000, {{not only in terms of}} forecasting accuracy, but also in terms of trading efficiency: In order to do so, we apply a realistic volatility trading strategy using FX <b>option</b> <b>straddles</b> once mispriced <b>options</b> have been identified. Allowing for transaction costs, most trading strategies retained produce positive returns. RNN models appear as the best single modelling approach yet, somewhat surprisingly, model combination which has the best overall performance in terms of forecasting accuracy, fails to improve the RNN-based volatility trading results. Another conclusion from our results is that, for the period and currencies considered, the currency option market was inefficient and/or the pricing formulae applied by market participants were inadequate...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} the {{performance}} of volatility options as hedging instruments for hedging volatility risk. We investigate (a) the relative hedging performance of volatility and European options, (b) the relative hedging performance of volatility index and <b>straddle</b> <b>options,</b> and (c) the impact of model misspecification on hedging effectiveness. Our focus is on exotic options as the options to be hedged, because they are more sensitive to volatility risk and model risk and practically more relevant when the effectiveness of different hedging strategies is examined. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we find that volatility options are especially useful for hedging options with a severe exotic feature and there is {{no significant difference between the}} performances of volatility index and <b>straddle</b> <b>options.</b> Furthermore, our results indicate that model misspecification has an important impact on the hedging performance.

40|$|Volatility risk {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the management of portfolios of derivative assets as well as portfolios of basic assets. This risk is currently managed by volatility "swaps" or futures. However, this risk could be managed more efficiently using options on volatility that were proposed in the past but were never introduced mainly due to the lack of a cost efficient tradable underlying asset. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new volatility instrument, an <b>option</b> on a <b>straddle,</b> which can be used to hedge volatility risk. The design and valuation of such an instrument are the basic ingredients of a successful financial product. In order to value these options, we combine the approaches of compound options and stochastic volatility. Our numerical results show that the <b>straddle</b> <b>option</b> is a powerful instrument to hedge volatility risk. An additional benefit of such an innovation is that it will provide a direct estimate of the market price for volatility risk. © 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} the economy that splits investors into two groups. One group (the reference traders) trades an underlying asset according to the difference in realized returns between that asset and some evolving consensus estimate of those returns; the other group (hedgers) hedge <b>options,</b> namely <b>straddles,</b> on the underlying asset. We consider the cases when hedgers are long the straddle and when the hedgers are short the straddle. We numerically simulate the terminal distribution of the underlying asset price and find that hedgers that are long the straddle tend to push the underlying toward the strike, while hedgers that are short the straddle cause the underlying security to have a bimodal terminal probability distribution with a local minimum at the strike. Stock-pinning, feedback effects, hedging, equilibrium...|$|R
40|$|Volatility risk {{has played}} a major role in several {{financial}} debacles (for example, Barings Bank, Long Term Capital Management). This risk could have been managed using options on volatility which were proposed in the past but were never offered for trading mainly due to the lack of a tradable underlying asset. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new volatility instrument, an <b>option</b> on a <b>straddle,</b> which can be used to hedge volatility risk. The design and valuation of such an instrument are the basic ingredients of a successful financial product. Unlike the proposed volatility index option, the underlying of this proposed contract is a traded atthe -money-forward straddle, which should be more appealing to potential participants. In order to value these options, we combine the approaches of compound options and stochastic volatility. We use the lognormal process for the underlying asset, the Orenstein-Uhlenbeck process for volatility, and assume that the two Brownian motions are independent. Our numerical results show that the <b>straddle</b> <b>option</b> price is very sensitive to the changes in volatility which means that the proposed contract is indeed a very powerful instrument to hedge volatility risk...|$|R

40|$|Value at Risk (VaR) is {{the worst}} {{possible}} loss in an investment in a reasonable bound. VaR is widely used for educational purposes and mostly for industrial purposes. Almost every investor {{is concerned about the}} question of what is the maximum can be lost in an investment. VaR tries to give an answer within certain boundary. So, it is very useful and application of VaR is significantly increasing. It can be implemented in various ways. There is a special need of software, which will compare and contrast between the ways of VaR‟s implementations. Also, for a financial market player, interested in <b>option</b> strategies, like <b>straddles,</b> strips, straps, and strangles, there is no straight forward software application to give them the forecasted profit/loss data in their chosen strategies. People have to calculate the strategies and respective profit or loss chart by pen and paper.
