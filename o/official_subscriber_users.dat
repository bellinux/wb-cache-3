40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{assesses the}} compatibility {{of the potential}} future UK legislation concerning search engines with Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). It argues that the possible introduction of anti-copyright infringement measures such as promotion and demotion of search results, voluntarily complying with website- blocking injunctions, and removing AutoComplete suggestions, might actually lead to undesirable censorship of legitimate sources of published material, by the private sector. It draws upon multiple primary and secondary sources, including the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) case-law, the Court of Justice of European Union???s (CJEU) case-law, Intellectual Property Adviser Mike Weatherley???s papers on search and piracy and ???follow the money??? initiatives, and Google???s reports. This paper focuses on the three-parts of the ECtHR???s non-cumulative test {{in an effort to}} establish whether the potential future UK legislation concerning search engines: firstly, is ???prescribed by law;??? secondly, pursues one or more legitimate aims included in Article 10 (2) of the ECHR; and thirdly, is ???necessary??? and ???proportionate???, in order to determine whether this constitutes a violation of a <b>subscriber,</b> <b>user</b> and site operator???s right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention. It concludes that unless the implementation of the potential future UK legislation concerning search engines: firstly, was limited in scope; secondly, expressly set out a specific obligation for the UK courts to assess whether the introduction of search result technical measures was necessary; and thirdly, was compliant with the ECtHR necessity, proportionality and adequacy principles, it could infringe part one and part three of the ECtHR???s test, thereby violating <b>subscribers,</b> <b>users</b> and site operators???

40|$|Advances in {{technology}} have enabled network-less mobile voice over internet protocol operator (MVoIPO) to offer data services (i. e. voice, text and video) to mobile network operator's (MNO's) subscribers through an application enabled on <b>subscriber's</b> <b>user</b> equipment using MNO's packet-based cellular network infrastructure. However, {{this raises the}} problem of how to handle interconnection settlements between the two types of operators, particularly how to deal with users who now have the ability to make ‘free’ on-net MVoIP calls among themselves within the MNO's network. This study proposes a service level agreement-based transparent settlement model (TSM) to solve this problem. The model is based on concepts of achievement and reward, not violation and punishment. The TSM calculates the MVoIPO's throughput distribution by monitoring the variations of peaks and troughs at the edge of a network. This facilitates the determination of conformance and non-conformance levels to the pre-set throughput thresholds and, subsequently, the issuing of compensation to the MVoIPO by the MNO as a result of generating an economically acceptable volume of data traffic...|$|R

5000|$|The {{true value}} of the graph {{approach}} becomes evident when one performs searches that are more than one level deep. For example, consider a search for users who have [...] "subscribers" [...] (a table linking users to other users) in the [...] "311" [...] area code. In this case a relational database has to first look for all the users with an area code in [...] "311", then look in the subscribers table for any of those users, and then finally look in the users table to retrieve the matching users. In contrast, a graph database would look for all the users in [...] "311", then follow the back-links through the subscriber relationship to find the <b>subscriber</b> <b>users.</b> This avoids several searches, lookups and the memory involved in holding all of the temporary data from multiple records needed to construct the output. Technically, this sort of lookup is completed in O(log(n)) + O(1) time, that is, roughly relative to the logarithm {{of the size of}} the data. In contrast, the relational version would be multiple O(log(n)) lookups, plus more time to join all the data.|$|R

30|$|The local {{impact of}} FAPs on SINR maps may be {{observed}} from each run among the random FAP deployments and random shadowing process. The example in Figure 4 shows SINR maps from one run simulated {{at the ground}} floor of two buildings from three idle FAPs and one active FAP deployed at {{the ground floor of}} one of these buildings. The SINR levels of the macro-only network ranges from − 5 to 20 [*]dB. The SINR levels for corporate FAP subscribers in the two-tier network (Figure 4 b) are up to 65 [*]dB better in the FAP areas than in the macro-only network; and up to 10 [*]dB better at 30 [*]m indoors and outdoors around each FAP (impact is visible as well in the neighbor building). Figure 4 c illustrates the SINR levels for FAP <b>subscribers.</b> <b>Users</b> inside the FAP areas are assumed to be FAP subscribers. Thus, as for corporate FAP subscribers, SINR levels in the FAP areas are up to 65 [*]dB better than in the macro-only network. On the other hand, users outside the FAP areas are assumed to be non-subscribers, thus the SINR levels are up to 17 [*]dB worse within 30 [*]m around the active FAP than in the macro-only network. Finally, Figure 4 d shows the SINR map for non-subscribers still in presence of closed-access FAPs; the SINR levels are up to 40 [*]dB worse in the active FAP area than in the macro-only network.|$|R
