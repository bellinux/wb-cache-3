40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to present a {{recently}} built interview corpus called Corpus of Hungarian School Metalanguage – Interview Corpus (CHSM-IC) and its potential in language ideology studies. This corpus was compiled during a broad survey on Hungarian school metalanguage carried out in 2009 and was recently made available for a wider research community within the CESAR (Central and South-East European Resources) project. The study investigates interactional routines <b>used</b> in <b>metadiscourses</b> <b>on</b> language <b>use.</b> Printed texts cited from prestigious handbooks and interview data from CHSM-IC are compared. Thus, widely used, culturally-inherited text fragments are detected and confronted with the interviewees’ narratives on their own communicational experiences. A case study on the discourse marker hát (‘so’, ‘well’) illustrates that there is a conflict and often a controversy between language ideologies disseminated by the Hungarian school system and the linguistic selfrepresentation in the interviewees’ narratives. Combining Language Ideology, Conversation Analysis, Discourse Analysis and Discursive Social Psychology frameworks, the paper presents a detailed description on the emergence of metadiscourses in a school setting. The paper concludes that metalinguistic utterances (e. g., answers on grammaticality, statements on linguistic accuracy, etc.) and observable, spontaneous (or semi-spontaneous) language use patterns are regularly not in accordance with each other...|$|R
40|$|This {{study on}} {{contrastive}} rhetoric reports <b>on</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> functions in sociology articles in Persian and English. The results have revealed {{a higher number}} of metadiscourse elements in the English texts. Among the different <b>metadiscourse</b> elements <b>used,</b> text connectors are the most frequently employed in both languages. Modality markers are the second most frequent in both languages although the English writers used nearly {{twice the number of}} these markers. Overall, it is found that the frequency of textual metadiscourse markers is greater than the interpersonal markers in both language samples. It was further revealed that the Persian writers of sociology texts are less interested in explicitly orienting the readers and some of the main points in an article, especially in the concluding section, are left for the readers to infer. This, we believe, is the result of less reliance on academic writing in the educational system of the country. Instead, the Iranians are largely encouraged to employ a flowery language and rhetoric to decorate their writing in their school years which makes them less attentive of their readers. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Meta{{discourse}}, {{known as}} discourse about ongoing discourse, {{has been the}} subject of discourse research from a wide range of perspectives. In academic contexts, knowledge of metadiscourse as a prominent feature of all types of academic discourse provides second language readers with information about writer’s attitudes towards the text and the readers. Over the past decade there has been a growing interest in conducting studies investigating different aspects of metadiscourse in relation to language learning. The present study hopes to contribute to the study of metadiscourse by investigating its effect on EFL learners’ reading comprehension (with three levels of reading proficiency: low, medium, and high) when faced two text types –academic and general. To this end, data were collected through two instruments, namely a TOEFL reading comprehension sample test and a reading comprehension test which consisted of two text types was developed for the purpose of this study. Two versions of this reading comprehension test were developed: one with metadiscourse enriched texts and the other with metadiscourse removed ones. The results of data analysis showed that students in all three levels of reading proficiency performed better <b>on</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> enriched test booklet than their counterpart groups who took the metadiscourse removed text booklet. In comparing students’ performance <b>on</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> removed text types, it was revealed that they did more poorly <b>on</b> academic <b>metadiscourse</b> removed test booklet than on general one.

Although many researchers have investigated this function in written texts, {{there has been little}} research <b>on</b> the role <b>metadiscourse</b> plays in the comprehension of spoken discourse. The aim {{of the present study was}} to gain insights into the effect of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>use</b> <b>on</b> Iranian EFL learners’ lecture comprehension. To do so, 22 students were selected to participate in the study. In order to assess the students’ language proficiency a pre-test, namely Oxford Placement Test (OPT), was used. Then the subjects were randomly divided into two groups. During ten sessions, students in two groups listened to lectures with different topics in the field of linguistics by the teacher. Two versions of the same lecture were used. One of them included metadiscourse markers (Hyland's model, 2005) and in the other one, metadiscourse markers were removed. To measure learners’ listening comprehension, a test consisting of a set of lecture-related questions (post-test) was administered. Then both groups of participants were asked to answer a questionnaire to assess the perceived level of the difficulty and the quality of the lecture. In order to analyze the obtained data, an independent t-Test was run.

40|$|Metadiscourse is {{the term}} used for self-reflective {{linguistic}} expressions that refer to the evolving text, to the writer, and to the imagined readers of that text. It {{is based on a}} view of writing as social engagement and in academic contexts reveals the ways writers project themselves into their discourse to signal their attitudes and commitments to matters in the text and to their disciplinary communities. This paper examines the frequencies and pragmatic purposes of metadiscourse in the relatively neglected academic genre of the book review. On the basis of a corpus of 84 reviews from three contrasting disciplines and interviews with journal editors and reviewers, we describe the ways these writers <b>use</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> to offer a credible representation of themselves and their work in different fields. The analysis shows how <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>use</b> can be seen as pragmatic strategies through which writers shape their social purposes to the formal constraints of the genre and the preferred practices of their disciplines. It therefore suggests how this genre not only draws on readers' familiarity with disciplinary knowledge of the field, but also an interpretive framework that includes appropriate social interactions. © Walter de Gruyter 2006. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a study {{into the nature}} and structure of academic lectures, with a special focus <b>on</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> phenomena. Metadiscourse refers {{to a set of}} linguistics expressions that signal specific discourse functions such as the Introduction: “Today we will talk about [...] . ” and Emphasising: “This is an important point”. These functions are important because they are part of lecturers’ strategies in understanding of what happens in a lecture. The knowledge of their presence and identity could serve as initial steps toward downstream applications that will require functional analysis of lecture content such as a browser for lectures archives, summarisation, or an automatic minute-taker for lectures. One challenging aspect for metadiscourse detection and classification is that the set of expressions are semi-fixed, meaning that different phrases can indicate the same function. To that end a four-stage approach is developed to study metadiscourse in academic lectures. Firstly, a corpus of metadiscourse for academic lectures from Physics and Economics courses is built by adapting an existing scheme that describes functional-oriented metadiscourse categories. Second, because producing reference transcripts is a time-consuming task and prone to some errors due to the manual efforts required, an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is built specifically to produce transcripts of lectures. Since the reference transcripts lack time-stamp information, an alignment system is applied to the reference to be able to evaluate the ASR system. Then, a model is developed using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to classify <b>metadiscourse</b> tags <b>using</b> both textual and acoustical features. The results show that n-grams are the most inductive features for the task; however, due to data sparsity the model does not generalise for unseen n-grams. This limits its ability to solve the variation issue in metadiscourse expressions. Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) provide a promising solution as this can capture both the syntactic and semantic similarities between words and thus is able to solve the generalisation issue. However, CBOW ignores the word order completely, something which is very important to be retained when classifying metadiscourse tags. The final stage aims {{to address the issue of}} sequence modelling by developing a joint CBOW and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. CNNs can work with continuous features such as word embedding in an elegant and robust fashion by producing a fixed-size feature vector that is able to identify indicative local information for the tagging task. The results show that <b>metadiscourse</b> tagging <b>using</b> CNNs outperforms the SVMs model significantly even on ASR outputs, owing to its ability to predict a sequence of words that is more representative for the task regardless of its position in the sentence. In addition, the inclusion of other features such as part-of-speech (POS) tags and prosodic cues improved the results further. These findings are consistent in both disciplines. The final contribution in this thesis is to investigate the suitability of <b>using</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> tags as discourse features in the lecture structure segmentation model, despite the fact that the task is approached as a classification model and most of the state-of-art models are unsupervised. In general, the obtained results show remarkable improvements over the state-of-the-art models in both disciplines. ...|$|R

One of these factors is that of gender, although this has been far less studied in published academic writing than in other forms of social interaction. In this paper, we explore the issue of gender in academic interactions by analyzing a corpus of academic book reviews and interviews with academics from Philosophy and Biology.

For this purpose, 20 EFL learners studying at Maravia Institute in Maragheh (placed at upper-intermediate levels of English language proficiency) were chosen {{on the basis of their}} performance in an Oxford Placement Test (OPT) to participate in the experiment. The participants were randomly divided into two groups of experimental and control. Both groups received instruction on writing for seven sessions. The given instruction was the same for each group: seven modes of development in essay writing were taught (Narration, Description, Example, Classification & Division, Compare & Contrast, Process, and Cause & Effect). Metadiscourse markers were also taught implicitly in the examples of each mode. The audience awareness was highlighted in the writing assignments of the experimental group by specifying a specific audience for each topic provided, while in the control group this awareness-raising was missing.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{metadiscourse}} – {{the ways in}} which writers and speakers interact through their use of language with readers and listeners (also referred to as metalanguage and metapragmatics) – has received considerable attention in applied linguistics in recent years, particularly in the study of academic discourse. Conceptualised within the applied linguistics context of developing optimal descriptions of genres as a basis for a genre-based pedagogy, this article first reviews some of the different approaches to metadiscourse, highlighting how the concept is construed in different ways by different researchers. The article then discusses a number of problematic issues in metadiscourse research: metadiscourse as textual or interpersonal; the size of the linguistic unit in metadiscourse research; the multi-functionality of metadiscourse items; and the issue of representativeness in corpus research <b>on</b> <b>metadiscourse.</b> The second part of the article focuses on the concept of signalling nouns (SNs) (abstract nouns which carry particular pragmatic meanings in discourse), a feature of discourse not usually included under the rubric of metadiscourse.

40|$|Nowadays, most {{scholars}} looking for promotion and other academic rewards must publish in impacted journals that use English. However, writing in this language {{is difficult for}} Non Native English (NNE) academics, who use other languages in their national disciplinary context. In such contexts, NNE researchers may benefit from comparative studies of the local and the native English (NE) writing conventions. Results from these studies can help NNE academics write more felicitous research texts in English. The present study comparatively analyses reflexive <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>use</b> in research articles (RAs) written in English by NE and Tunisian researchers. The analysis investigates reflexive metadiscourse in a corpus of 100 RAs from hard and soft sciences, with 50 RAs from each cultural group. The focus of this work is on Economics, Business and Management RAs as samples of the soft sciences and Earth and Planetary Sciences RAs as samples of the hard sciences. This work uses an analytical model which draws its main components from Mauranen (1993 b) and Adel (2006). A number of adjustments are made in order to render the model more applicable to the research article genre. Employing corpus linguistics methods, this thesis {{has shown that the}} NE writers use more markers of total reflexive metadiscourse in the soft than in the hard sciences, while Tunisian authors use equal amounts in the two sciences. It was also found that reflexive metadiscourse is denser in the argumentative RA sections followed by the opening and closing sections, while it is much less frequent in the expository sections.

Kinds of interactive metadiscourse found in Michelle Obama Speech are 145 (38, 8 %) transitional which is the highest percentage, because transitional is conjunction that functions to relate one sentence with other sentences, next is 9 (2, 4 %) frame markers, then 7 (1, 8 %) code glosses and the last is 4 (1, 1 %) evidentials. Meanwhile, kinds of interactional metadiscourse found in Michelle Obama Speech are 40 (10, 7 %) hedges, 8 (2, 1 %) boosters, after that 135 (36 %) self mentions. Self Mentions is the dominant interactional metadiscourse, because when Michelle Obama speaks about her opinion, she gives statement to audience who became author for them and the last for interactional category is 26 (7, 0 %) engagement marker...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to describe}} rhetorical moves, metadiscourse types and resources used {{to accompany the}} moves in English abstract section of undergraduate students’ (thesis) article at STKIP PGRI Jombang. Moreover, this research also explains how the metadiscourse functions are applied {{in relation to the}} moves. The method of this study is qualitative research. The data collected using non-participant observation method and note taking techniques were analyzed with the theory of rhetorical moves in abstracts and metadiscourse. The results show that from 42 abstracts, only few abstracts from science belong to informational abstracts. Humanities tends to use three moves with the pattern PMR (Purpose, Method, Results); meanwhile, science andsocial science tend to use four moves with the pattern BPMR (Background, Purpose, Method, Results). On the whole, interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> is infrequently <b>used.</b> In terms of functions of metadiscourse in relation to moves, discourse goal (sub-type of frame markers) characterizes Move 2. Then, the resources of boosters which characterize move 4 are show, found, obtained, embodied, and revealed. Conclude (resources of frame markers sub-type—discourse stage) characterizes move 5. Some metadiscourse types related to the moves applied are evidentials, hedges, boosters, attitude markers and self-mentions. There are also certain resources in certain metadiscourse types which exist in certain move such as the resource of transitions and code glosses. In conclusion, only few abstracts from science support support Day’s (1995) model. In the <b>use</b> of <b>metadiscourse,</b> the <b>use</b> of interactive <b>metadiscourse</b> is dominant. From 10 types of metadiscourse, transitions are frequently employed...|$|R

5000|$|The term <b>metadiscourse</b> is also <b>used</b> {{in writing}} to {{describe}} a word or phrase that comments on {{what is in the}} sentence, usually as an introductory adverbial clause. It is any phrase that is included within a clause or sentence that goes beyond the subject itself, often to examine the purpose of the sentence or a response from the author. Metadiscourse includes phrases such as [...] "frankly," [...] "after all," [...] "on the other hand," [...] "to our surprise," [...] and so on.|$|R
40|$|O objetivo desta dissertação é examinar o metadiscurso textual e o interpessoal em seis introduções de artigos científicos coletados em periódicos de três universidades brasileiras na área da Linguística Aplicada: D. E. L. T. A (PUC/SP), ALFA (UNESP) e Cadernos de Estudos Linguísticos e Trabalhos em Linguística Aplicada (UNICAMP). O exame do metadiscurso implica recorrer a teorias de origens várias. Nesse sentido, seguimos Fowler (1991), que se confessa essencialmente eclético em relação à sua atitude aos instrumentos de análise, mas que, aponta como o melhor modelo para examinar a conexão entre estrutura lingüística e valores sociais, o modelo funcional desenvolvido por Halliday e seus pesquisadores. Constituem, também, objeto de interesse de minha análise e que embasam a metodologia da presente pesquisa, os conceitos de: (a) metafunção interpessoal (Halliday, 1985; 1994; 2004) e token de atitude (MARTIN, 2000); (b) avaliação (MARTIN, 2000; HYLAND, 1997; 1998; 2000; 2005; VERSTRAETE, 2001) (c) footing e alinhamento (GOFFMAN, 1974); (d) polidez (BROWN & LEVINSON (1987) This {{research}} aims {{to examine}} the textual and interpersonal metafunctions present {{in the introduction to}} six scientific articles found in four different journals on Applied Linguistics published by three Brazilian universities: D. E. L. T. A (PUC/SP), ALFA (UNESP), Cadernos de Estudos Linguísticos and Trabalhos em Linguística Aplicada (UNICAMP). In order to carry out the research <b>on</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> we will draw on the work of different authors and on various theoretical approaches. In this respect, Fowler (1991), whose attitude towards his instruments of analysis is eclectic, acknowledges that the Hallidayan functional mode of analysis is the best model {{for the study of the}} relationship between linguistic structure and social values. As well as being another topic of concern in this study, the following concepts will also ground the methodology of this research: (a) interpersonal metafunction (HALLIDAY, 1985; 1994; 2004) and tokens of attitude (MARTIN, 2000); (b) appraisal (MARTIN, 2000; HYLAND, 1997; 1998; 2000; 2005; VERSTRAETE, 2001); (c) footing and alignment (GOFFMAN, 1974); (d) politeness (BROWN & LEVINSON (1987...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} an attempt to {{investigate}} the functional role of textual and interpersonal metadiscourse markers in English and Persian Economic news reports. To this end, 10 news articles, 5 in each language, were randomly selected from the Economic sections of the leading newspapers published in 2013 - 2014 in Iran and the United States. Based on Kopple’s (1985) taxonomy, the type and frequency of <b>metadiscourse</b> markers <b>used</b> in the texts were analyzed to find out their functions in the text. The findings revealed that the textual markers used by Persian authors were considerably more frequent than those employed by the American writers. Interestingly, unlike the Persian writers, the American authors enlisted a larger number of interpersonal markers, which made their angle of the subject treatment different. It is evident that the differential <b>use</b> of <b>metadiscourse</b> markers by nationally different authors could be attributed to culture-specific norms governing the development and organization of discourse...|$|R
