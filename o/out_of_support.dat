25|$|Although {{he did not}} {{explicitly}} call for Egyptians to join the opposition armed forces in the Syrian conflict, Morsi's attendance at the 15 June rally was seen {{by many to be}} an implicit nod-of-approval for the Islamist clerics' calls for jihad in Syria. Morsi was criticized by Egyptian analysts for attending and speaking at the rally, while the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) released a statement the day after the rally saying that its only role is to protect Egypt's borders, in an apparent ruling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for intervention in Syria. Morsi's attendance at the rally was later revealed to be {{a major factor in the}} largely secular SCAF's decision to side with anti-Morsi protesters over the Morsi government during the widespread June 2013 anti-Morsi protests.|$|E

Even though the iPhone 3G, the newly released iPhone 3GS, and the original iPhone all received the OS 3.0 update, the original iPhone was left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for MMS, citing hardware challenges. Messages also gained support for sharing contacts using the vCard standard. Other big changes included support for copy and paste, and the ability to forward or delete multiple messages at a time.|$|E

5000|$|His work {{brought him}} to the {{attention}} of French writer Jean-Paul Sartre, who had Oski create the backdrop for the Buenos Aires performance of his play, The Polite Prostitute in 1947. Irish writer George Bernard Shaw also turned to him for the Argentine premiere of his play, Androcles and the Lion, which played in 1953. Oski had an anthology of his work published in 1952, as well as an animated film, The First Foundation of Buenos Aires, in 1959. Made in an era in which such historical events were treated as sacrosanct epics by the State and much of the media, First Foundation was a slapstick look at the imposing Spanish Conquistadores and their conflict with retaliating indigenous peoples. A similar theme prevailed is his satirical comic book, The True History of the Indies, in 1968. He also illustrated unconventional editions of Argentine literary epics, such a University of Buenos Aires edition of Estanislao del Campos Fausto (an adaptation of the traditional tale - here protagonized by a Gaucho). Sought-after internationally, he relocated to Santiago, Chile in 1970, partly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for President Salvador Allende. There, he illustrated Cabrochico Magazine until returning to Argentina in 1972.|$|E
50|$|The strike {{began on}} September 22, 1910, when sixteen women protested the Hart, Schaffner, Marx firm {{due to a}} biased bonus system and {{a cut in the}} piece rate. The strike grew rapidly and tremendously {{by the end of the}} first week as 2,000 women had joined the effort. The peak of the strikers came when the strike was sanctioned by the UGW with 41,000 workers walking off the job. Even though, the UGW {{supported}} the strikers, its support was not sufficient as the UGW did not call a general strike but relied upon the workers that did not have contracts and the HSM was able to counter the strikers by providing work to non-union subcontractors. This resulted in the strike losing an edge on the HSM and subsequently the strike began to decline. The UGW backed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> in December 1910 as the Chicago Federation of Labor and the Women's Trade Union League (WTUL) encouraged that the strikers reach a deal. A deal was reached when the labor leader Sidney Hillman collaborated with the HSM firm. After a bitter, four-month strike, Hillman was instrumental in convincing the HSM to accept most worker demands, including recognition of newly formed Local 39 of the UGW, and an agreement to settle some future disputes by arbitration.|$|E
50|$|By 1913 she {{had joined}} the Labour Party, partly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for socialist principles, {{but also as a}} route into local politics. In November 1913 she was elected to Leith Town Council, giving her the {{distinction}} of being the first Labour woman member of a town council in Scotland. As a councillor she took a personal interest in medical and child welfare issues. In 1916 she was appointed as the Women's Labour League representative to attend meetings of the Scottish Executive Committee of the Labour Party. There she met, worked with, and eventually married in Edinburgh in July 1918, Benjamin Howard Shaw, first Secretary of the Scottish Labour Party. The couple complemented each other in terms of political ideas and tastes, teetotalism, and temperance reform. Both she and Ben Shaw were also closely associated with the Glasgow Socialist Sunday School, of which Clarice was the national president for twenty-five years. The marriage did not produce any children. In 1921 they moved to Troon. She was subsequently a member of Troon Town Council and Ayrshire County Council, and during the next twenty years she fulfilled a number of roles in civic administration, continuing her educational campaign and serving as a JP. She was appointed a member of the Scottish Food Council, the price regulation committee for Scotland, and the 1928 Royal Commission on Educational Endowments in Scotland. Twice—in 1929 and 1931—she unsuccessfully fought Ayr Burghs at the general election.|$|E
50|$|Maria Theresa's diplomats, after {{securing}} French neutrality, actively {{began to}} establish an anti-Prussian coalition. Austria's actions alerted Frederick II, who decided to strike first by invading Saxony, commencing the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). Frederick's actions were meant to scare Russia <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>supporting</b> Austria (the two countries had previously entered into a defensive alliance in 1746). However, by invading Saxony, Frederick had inflamed his enemies; Russia, {{under the direction of}} Empress Elizabeth, sent an additional 80,000 troops to Austria. One year after the signing of the First Treaty of Versailles, France and Austria signed a new offensive alliance, the Second Treaty of Versailles, on 1 May 1757.|$|R
