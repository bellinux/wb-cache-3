No attempt is made to resolve the situation, and if that's a happy ending, I've seen happier. Despite its creativity, the film remains space opera and avoids the higher realms of science-fiction." [...] Josh Tyler of Cinema Blend says the film is unique in interpretation and execution, but considers {{it to be a}} knockoff of the 1988 film Alien Nation.|$|E

6000|$|I {{had seen}} Kysh drive before, and I thought I knew the <b>Octopod,</b> but that {{afternoon}} he and she were exalted beyond my knowledge. He improvised on the keys--the snapping levers and quivering accelerators--marvellous variations, {{so that our}} progress was sometimes a fugue and sometimes a barn-dance, varied on open greens by the weaving of fairy rings. When I protested, all that he would say was: [...] "I'll hypnotise the fowl! I'll dazzle the rooster!" [...] or other words equally futile. And she--oh! that I could do her justice!--she turned her broad black bows to the westering light, and lifted us high upon hills that we might see and rejoice with her. She whooped into veiled hollows of elm and Sussex oak; she devoured infinite perspectives of park palings; she surged through forgotten hamlets, whose single streets gave back, reduplicated, the clatter of her exhaust, and, tireless, she repeated the motions. Over naked uplands she droned like a homing bee, her shadow lengthening in the sun that she chased to his lair. She nosed up unparochial byways and accommodation- roads of the least accommodation, and put old scarred turf or new-raised molehills under her most marvellous springs with never a jar. And since the King's highway is used for every purpose save traffic, in mid-career she stepped aside for, or flung amazing loops about, the brainless driver, the driverless horse, the drunken carrier, the engaged couple, the female student of the bicycle and her staggering instructor, the pig, the perambulator, and the infant school (where it disembogued yelping on cross-roads), with the grace of Nellie Farren (upon whom be the Peace) and the lithe abandon of all the Vokes family. But at heart she was ever Judic as I remember that Judic long ago--Judic clad in bourgeois black from wrist to ankle, achieving incredible improprieties.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Octopod</b> Circular External Fixator is {{medical device}} {{developed}} to treat bone fractures and deformities. The device consists of 4 main vertical struts between 2 rings and 4 assistant diagonal struts. This 3rd Generation Circular External Fixator thus contains 8 combined mobile struts {{from which it}} derives its <b>octopod</b> name. With the <b>octopod</b> method the device can reach a wider correction range, thereby solving a major problem of the 2nd Generation Circular External Fixators, that of having to frequently change struts. The previous difficulties in taking manual measurements when using both 1st and the 2nd Generation External Fixators are resolved by using the 3rd Generation Circular External Fixator.|$|E

Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology, number 121, 46 pages, 53 figures. 1972. —Twenty-seven {{photographs}} from seven deep-sea localities in the North Atlantic reveal cirrate <b>octopods</b> {{in their natural}} habitat. The photographs demonstrate that these <b>octopods</b> are benthopelagic, living just above the bottom at depths of 2, 500 to greater than 5, 000 m. Typical cephalopoda locomotion is exhibited {{as well as a}} drifting or hunting phase, and possibly a pulsating phase. Animals range in size from approximately 10 to 128 cm in total length, and up to 170 cm across the outstretched arms and webs. Scale size was determined mainly by a new technique termed shadow geometry, introduced here. Observations on shading ("coloration") indicate the possibility of "reverse coloration" on some specimens. Cirrates are more abundant in the Virgin Islands Basin than in other areas sampled. Additional photographs of plant debris, animals and lebensspuren (evidence of organisms in the sediment) suggest that the abundance level of benthic and benthopelagic organisms is related to the presence of plant material of shallow-water origin.

40|$|Difficulties in elucidating the {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} <b>octopods</b> have arisen from problems in identifying informative morphological characters. Recent classifications have divided the largest group, the incirrate <b>octopods,</b> into five groups.

All benthic incirrate <b>octopods</b> have been accommodated in the family Octopodidae, itself divided into four subfamilies, Octopodinae, Eledoninae, Bathypolypodinae and Graneledoninae, which are defined by {{the presence or absence}} of an ink sac, and uniserial or biserial sucker arrangements on the arms. We used relaxed clock models in a Bayesian framework and maximum likelihood methods to analyse three nuclear and four mitochondrial genes of representatives from each of the previous subfamilies. Strong evidence indicates that the family Octopodidae is paraphyletic and contains the gelatinous pelagic families.
