25|$|The {{indictment}} of Zörgiebel {{was rejected by}} the state prosecutors and Litten appealed. Zörgiebel turned around and filed charges against a worker who had slapped his ear. Litten then took on this worker's defense, arguing that the worker had acted out of justifiable anger about Zörgiebel's 33 murders. The justice rejected Litten's request to produce evidence {{on the grounds that the}} 33-count murder indictment against Zörgiebel could be accepted as fact without dropping the culpability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> who had hit Zörgiebel on the ear.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{intention}} of the Union {{was that it would}} support and promote the interests of worker co-operatives but, given the number and financial strength of the consumer co-operatives, these soon began to dominate the organisation. Ultimately, this led to the splitting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> and consumer sectors of the UK Movement, prompted by the CWS' rejection of the idea of profit-sharing with its employees in 1880. From that point the Co-operative Union became an organisation that predominantly dealt with co-operative retail societies.|$|E

25|$|Fine Gael's {{proposals}} have sometimes been criticised mostly by smaller political groupings in Ireland, and {{by some of}} the trade unions, who have raised the idea that the party's solutions are more conscious of business interests than the interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worker.</b> The SIPTU trade union has stated its opposition to the Taoiseach Enda Kenny's assertion, in response to Ireland's economic crisis, that the national wage agreement should be suspended.

25|$|To give a {{concrete}} example of this, a worker making shoes in a shoe factory {{is not only}} producing shoes, but potential exchange-value. The shoes are commodities that can be sold for cash. In this way, {{the value of the}} labor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> is the exchange-value of the shoes he or she produces minus his or her compensation. At the same time, however, the shoes produced have certain social or cultural values as well. In this way, the worker’s labor is mediating between the economic or exchange-value of the shoes, and their social or cultural, or symbolic value.|$|E
25|$|The {{average life}} span of an adult Vespula vulgaris {{is known to be}} around two weeks (14 days). There was a {{negative}} correlation found between the age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> Vespula vulgaris and their respective foraging speeds, and a positive correlation between their age and the amount of time each worker spent in the nest between each foraging trip. The foraging speed decreased as the workers aged and the time a worker spent in the nest between foraging trips increased as they got older. Wasps that are over 30 days, in fact, generally cease from foraging trips and spend all of their time guarding the entrance of the nest.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} the rights {{mentioned}} in an official contract, in practice the rights were ineffective. In the case of conflicts matters were often settled out of court, {{not only in the}} case of nonpayment of salary but also in the case of physical abuses. Under the Kafala system a domestic worker might be administratively detained in the event of fleeing the household of the employer. That in turn places the employer in a better position when negotiating the rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worker.</b> As a result, the domestic workers often drop the charges against the employer or even refrain from filing a case before the court.|$|E
25|$|In the US, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits {{employment}} {{discrimination based}} on race, sex, color, national origin or religion. Initially only intended to combat sexual harassment of women, {42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2} the prohibition of sex discrimination covers both females and males. This discrimination occurs when the sex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> is made {{as a condition of}} employment (i.e. all female waitpersons or male carpenters) or where this is a job requirement that does not mention sex but ends up preventing many more persons of one sex than the other from the job (such as height and weight limits). This act only applies to employers with 15 or more employees.|$|E
25|$|In {{pharaoh ant}} colonies new males and queen ants can be {{produced}} when the existing fertile queen is removed. When queens are absent, the workers in the nest can do two things: either rear existing sexual larvae or transport sexual larvae from other bud nests or from the main nest to its own nest. However, when there are fertile queens still within the nest, the worker ants will cannibalize the sexual larvae and will either reject or consume sexual larvae from other nests. On the other hand, the worker ants will always accept and nurture worker larvae from other nests. Furthermore, according to Schmidt et al., polygamous species such as pharaoh ants will have higher resource allocations towards the female caste instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> caste to ensure rapid growth of new budding colonies.|$|E
