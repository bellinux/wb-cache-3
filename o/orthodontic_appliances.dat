40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: Children {{with bad}} habit and the {{persistence}} of deciduous teeth can caused malposition of anterior permanent teeth or Angle Class I Type 1 malocclusion. One of the curative treatment is removable <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the difference of dental arch width, overjet and overbite in patients with Angle Class I Type 1 before and after treated with removable <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance</b> in Dental Student Clinic in Faculty of Dentistry Padjadjaran University. Method: The research was conducted using 33 patient study models of Angle Class I Type 1 who were treated with removable appliance from year 2014 to 2015 in accordance with the criteria. Research method statistically analyzed with paired t-test sample. The dental arch width, overjet and overbite were measured with caliper of patient study models before and after treatment with removable <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance.</b> Results: The difference value before and after treatment using removable <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance</b> were 2. 8 % for anterior dental arch width, 2. 4 % for posterior dental arch width, 10. 7 % for overjet and 11 % for overbite.  Conclusion: The differences value of dental arch width, overjet and overbite in patients with Angle Class I Type 1 before and after treated with removable <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance</b> showed only a little progress of the treatment caused by multiple factors.   Keywords: Angle class I type 1, Dental arch width, Overjet, Overbit...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Our {{objective}} was to determine changes in oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) during fixed <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance</b> therapy. Methods: This prospective cohort study included a consecutive sample of 217 children receiving fixed <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance</b> therapy. Each subject completed the 37 -item child perception questionnaire (CPQ) at 5 times: before treatment (T 0), and after {{the placement of the}} fixed appliance at 1 week (T 1), 1 month (T 2), 3 months (T 3), and 6 months (T 4). Results: The response rate was 91 % (198 of 217). There were significant changes in overall CPQ scores (P. 05). Conclusions: Changes in OHRQoL occur after fixed <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance</b> therapy. Compared with pretreatment, a patient's OHRQoL is frequently worse during treatment (oral symptoms, functional limitations), although it is better in some aspects (emotional well-being). The period of greatest change in OHRQoL occurs during the first month of treatment. © 2008 American Association of Orthodontists. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Introduction/Objective. Pain {{and social}} {{discomfort}} are common experiences after {{the insertion of}} a fixed <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance.</b> The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the intensity of pain during the first seven days after the placement of a fixed <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance,</b> the impact of orthodontic treatment on psychosocial component of the patient and daily life activities in the first month of therapy. Methods. The study included 60 randomly selected patients from the Department of Orthodontics, Faculty of Dental Medicine, Belgrade, Serbia, aged 15 to 20 years. After the insertion of a fixed <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance,</b> the patients were given a questionnaire form comprising questions related to the intensity of pain in the first seven days, function of speech and chewing, oral hygiene, injury of the oral mucosa, and social contacts. For the processing of results obtained from the questionnaire χ 2 test was used. Results. The largest percentage of respondents (21. 7 %) rated pain with grade 1, while less than 10 % of respondents gave grades 4, 6, 7, 9, and 10. Most of the participants (95 %) answered that they had no difficulties with daily life activities caused by the fixed <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance.</b> Most respondents (91. 7 %) did not have any social discomfort, while a small percentage (8. 3 %) said they had these problems. Conclusion. General intensity of pain that respondents felt during the first seven days after the placement of a fixed <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance</b> was low to moderate. For most of the respondents there was no change in social behavior related to the psychosocial component. Except for changes in dietary habits and sores on the oral mucosa of the cheek in the first month of therapy, examines had no major problems with daily life activities...|$|R

40|$|This {{randomized}} split-mouth {{study was}} aimed at evaluating whether an <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance</b> per se or orthodontic tooth movement can induce detectable changes in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) volume, and thus whether GCF volume is a predictable biomarker for tissue remodelling incident to orthodontic tooth movement. Materials and Methods: Sixteen healthy orthodontic patients (7 females and 9 males; mean age, 17. 7 years; range, 13 - 27 years) {{with the need for}} extraction of the first upper premolars were enrolled. One randomly chosen maxillary canine was subjected to a distalizing force by a 0. 017 × 0. 025 inch titanium-molybdenum alloy archwire and considered as the test tooth (TT). The contralateral canine, which was not subjected to any force but was included in an <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance,</b> was used as a control (CT). GCF sampling was performed at both mesial and distal sites of the CTs and TTs at baseline, immediately before applying the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance,</b> and after 1 hour, 24 hours, and 7, 14, and 21 days. A Periotron was used to measure the GCF volume. A modest but significant increase in the GCF volume over time was seen in both the CTs (mesial sites) and the TTs (both mesial and distal sites) with no differences between the experimental teeth. Subclinical tissue inflammation consequent to the placement of the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance</b> might be responsible for these GCF volume changes. The GCF volume {{does not appear to be}} a reliable biomarker for tissue remodelling during orthodontic treatment...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated that there were several reactions in cellular activity and periodontal ligament collagen fibre as a response after orthodontic force application. Cementum has function to give attachment to collagen fibres of the periodontal ligament, maintaining the integrity of the root, helping to maintain the tooth in its functional position in the mouth, and being involved in tooth repair and regeneration so in the orthodontic tooth movement can induce changes in the cementum. The aim of this research is to investigate that fixed <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance</b> can change the amount of periodontal ligament collagen fibre and the thickness of inserting periodontal ligament fibre bundles at pressure site of cementum. This experimental study was held in laboratory with post test only control group design. Twenty two (22) premolar sample from 11 patient were divided into 2 groups. K group as control group (without treatment) and P group as treatment group (with using fixed <b>orthodontic</b> <b>appliance).</b> The amount of periodontal ligament collagen fibre and thickness of inserting periodontal ligament fibre bundles was examined by light microscopy and measured by image tool program.
