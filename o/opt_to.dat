5|$|Before this {{parliamentary}} decree, the purchaser of a tulip contract—known {{in modern}} finance as a futures contract—was legally obliged {{to buy the}} bulbs.

5|$|Cannon Fodder 2 is a military-themed action {{game with}} {{strategy}} and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad {{of up to}} four soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round.

Ammunition for these weapons is limited and the player must find supply crates to replenish his troops. Wasting these weapons can potentially result in the player not having enough to fulfil the mission objectives. The player can <b>opt</b> <b>to</b> shoot crates – destroying enemy troops and buildings in the ensuing explosion – at less risk to his soldiers than retrieving them, but again at {{a greater risk of}} depleting ammunition.|$|E
