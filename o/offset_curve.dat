40|$|International audienceGeneral <b>offset</b> <b>curves</b> {{are treated}} {{in the context of}} Minkowski {{geometry}}, the geometry of the two-dimensional plane, stemming from the consideration of a strictly convex, centrally symmetric given curve as its unit circle. Minkowski geometry permits us to move beyond classical confines and provides us with a framework in which to generalize the notion of Pythagorean-hodograph curves in the case of rational general offsets, namely, Minkowski isoperimetric-hodograph curves. Differential geometric topics in the Minkowski plane, including the notion of normality, Frenet frame, Serret–Frenet equations, involutes and evolutes are introduced. These lead to an elegant process from which an explicit parametric representation of the general <b>offset</b> <b>curves</b> is derived. Using the duality between indicatrix and isoperimetrix and between involutes and evolutes, rational curves with rational general offsets are characterized. The dual Bézier notion is invoked to characterize the control structure of Minkowski isoperimetric-hodograph curves. This characterization empowers the constructive process of freeform <b>curve</b> design involving <b>offsetting</b> techniques...|$|R

40|$|Offseƫng is an {{important}} task in diverse applicaƟons in the manufacturing business. For a set C in the Euclidean plane, the constant-radius offset with offset distance r is the set of all points of the plane whose minimum distance from C is exactly r. Formally, this <b>offset</b> <b>curve</b> {{can be defined as}} the boundary of the set∪p 2 C B(p; r), whereB(p; r) denotes a disk with radius r centered at the point p. That is, the offset is the envelope of a set of disks of equal radius that have their centers along the input. MathemaƟcally, the same <b>offset</b> <b>curve</b> can also be obtained as the Minkowski sum of C with a disk with radius r centered at the origin. For polygons such an <b>offset</b> <b>curve</b> will consist of one or more closed curves made up of line segments and circular arcs, see Figure 1, leŌ. Held [3] describes how to use a Voronoi diagram, which is a versaƟle tool in computaƟonal geometry, to compute such an offset efficiently and reliably. Mitered offsets differ from constant-radius offsets in the handling of non-convex verƟces of an input polygon: Instead of adding circular arcs to the <b>offset</b> <b>curve,</b> the offset segments of the two edges incident to a non-convex vertex get extended unƟl they intersect. This type of offset can be generated in linear Ɵme from a straight skeleton [4]. In order to avoid very sharp corners in the offset, the linear axis can be used in place of the straight skeleton [4], thus obtaining offsets with mulƟ-segment bevels. See Figure 1, center and right.
