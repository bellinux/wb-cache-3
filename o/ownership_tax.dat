40|$|In countries, such as Singapore, {{that have}} {{implemented}} vehicle congestion policies, {{recent years have}} seen a shift towards motor vehicle taxes based on car use. <b>Ownership</b> <b>taxes</b> {{reduce the number of}} cars on the road, leaving the price per trip largely unaffected. Use taxes such as fuel taxes and road use charges decrease the price of trips without necessarily penalising vehicle ownership per se. This paper presents a simple general equilibrium model involving trips from residential areas to a central business district, along with modal choice between cars and public transit. Car trips involve fixed costs but have lower variable costs per trip (including convenience costs) then bus trips. Using a calibrated numerical model, we investigate the relative merits of <b>ownership</b> and use <b>taxes.</b> We compare full internalisation of congestion externalities to optimal tax outcomes for the different tax types. In our framework, use taxes restore Pareto optimality since congestion damage rises with more trips. <b>Ownership</b> <b>taxes</b> only partially internalise congestion externalities. However, in terms of revenue-raising ability, the marginal excess burdens of <b>ownership</b> <b>taxes</b> in the neighbourhood of optimal taxes are typically lower than use taxes. This is because marginal increases in <b>ownership</b> <b>taxes</b> take away part of the surplus accruing to consumers who still choose to travel by car, and thus have less distortion at the margin. ...|$|R

However, the variation within income groups is substantial; the fraction of the population who suffer substantial welfare losses relative to income is much higher in lower income groups.
