5|$|A notable venue {{not found}} at the 1956 Games was an Olympic Village, where the athletes would be housed. The town of Cortina d'Ampezzo had a {{population}} of less than 7,000 people in 1956. Local hotels were concerned that after the Olympics an Olympic Village would so significantly increase the hotel capacity it would put many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of business. Athletes were billeted by local families or stayed in hotels during the Games.|$|E
5|$|An {{immediate}} concern of environmentalists was the potential {{use of chemical}} dispersants. To keep big slicks from washing ashore, dispersants {{can be used to}} break the oil into small droplets that disperse throughout the water column. There are significant concerns about the health effects of the dispersants and the effects on aquatic life. Coast Guard officials overseeing the cleanup indicated that no chemical dispersants were being used but did not immediately rule the use <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although {{a few of}} Harding's cabinet appointees were scandal-tarred, Coolidge {{initially}} retained all <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>out</b> of {{an ardent}} conviction that as successor to a deceased elected president he was obligated to retain Harding's counselors and policies until the next election. He kept Harding's able speechwriter Judson T. Welliver; Stuart Crawford replaced Welliver in November 1925. Coolidge appointed C. Bascom Slemp, a Virginia Congressman and experienced federal politician, to work jointly with Edward T. Clark, a Massachusetts Republican organizer whom he retained from his vice-presidential staff, as Secretaries to the President (a position equivalent to the modern White House Chief of Staff).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris sneaks into Meg's {{bedroom and}} reads her diary. Discovering him, Meg chases after Chris while Stewie walks by the staircase. Accidentally bumped by them, Stewie tumbles {{down the stairs}} and becomes unconscious, {{suffering}} a severe head wound. Chris and Meg hide the wound with a hat. Continuing the charade, they are approached by Peter, who asks how long Stewie has been unconscious. Peter reveals that he has knocked both <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> plenty of times, and wants to continue hiding Stewie's injury from Lois until he can frame her for it. The next day, noticing Lois pulling out of the driveway, Peter throws Stewie behind her car, making it appear as if Lois has run him over. Lois suggests they frame someone else, but Peter professes his love for her and suggests they take Stewie to the hospital. At the end of the show, Stewie walks in on the family with his head wrapped in bandages, revealing that many months have passed since his accident, he asks what happened to him.|$|E

5|$|With Jock in {{increasingly}} {{poor health}} after the war, the Smith family briefly considered sending Ian {{to start a}} life in the United States {{with the help of}} Jock's brother Elijah, who had become a prosperous New York businessman. Smith showed little interest in leaving Rhodesia, however, and decided that he would finish at university, then come home and buy his own farm. He returned to Rhodesia in early-1946 to find the campus swamped with veterans like himself—there were 400 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of barely 1,000 students. Smith became spokesman for the university's ex-servicemen, senior student of his hall and Chairman of the students' representative council. He turned down the presidency of the rowing club, saying it would be one administrative commitment too many, but agreed to coach the crew. Training the rowers under strict military-style discipline, he led them to victory at the 1946 South African Inter-Varsity Boat Race at the Vaal Dam south of Johannesburg, upstaging the well-fancied Wits crew, and subsequently received national-standard varsity honours for rowing, the first Rhodes student ever to do so. At the end of the year, having passed the exams to gain his commerce degree ("by some miracle", he recalled), he returned to Southern Rhodesia to study farming at Gwebi Agricultural College, near Salisbury.|$|E

25|$|That wasn't {{nearly as}} embarrassing, however, as Sri Lanka's top order collapse. Marvan Atapattu, Sanath Jayasuriya and Mahela Jayawardene – all {{experienced}} Test batsmen – rolled over to Daren Powell and Jermaine Lawson, as Sri Lanka {{first went to}} 7 for 2 and then 47 for 4. Thilan Samaraweera and Tillakaratne Dilshan staged a small recovery, with 11 and 32 respectively, but when Lawson and Omari Banks got the pair <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>out,</b> things were promising for West Indies, with Sri Lanka on the rack at 93 for 6. With Gayan Wijekoon playing an obviously premeditated slash to a ball from Tino Best, which went to the hands of Sylvester Joseph, West Indies were hopeful of getting a first innings lead of 100-odd.|$|E
25|$|Edmund slowly gets {{over his}} love for Mary. Then he comes to realise how {{important}} Fanny is to him.

Tom recovers from his illness, a steadier and better man for it, and Julia's husband, Mr Yates, proves to be a respectable husband. Henry Crawford refuses to marry Maria. Her shame gives her no other options, so her father sets her up in a house with Aunt Norris (for the role she had played as an ineffectual guardian and role model), the both <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of his sight.

25|$|Noss and Park {{would go}} on to score seven {{victories}} in August 1917, with an outstanding performance on the 17th. That was the day that Park went to the rescue of a Sopwith Camel being attacked by three German Albatros D.IIIs. In the process of driving the three Germans away, Noss and Park were assailed by two more of the enemy. Noss fired at the attacking pair; when they overran his fighter, Park took his turn and shot them both down. At that point, another trio of Germans attacked; Noss spun one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> with machine gun fire. Park chased after the falling German; still another three Germans attacked, but they also overran the British crew. Park then saw a second Sopwith Camel under attack from a German, and pumped 100 rounds of machine gun ammunition into the German from 50 yards range. The German spun out, for the British crew's fourth win of the day. They would win the Military Cross for this action; the award was announced on 26 September 1917.|$|E

Alesi was having gearbox troubles and was holding back Piquet as Prost began to attack both of them. On lap 70, Piquet passed Alesi and Prost followed him through. Prost then shifted sides getting ahead of Piquet as well. Modena passed Alesi for fourth and Alesi soon retired with gearbox troubles. Unflustered by all this, Senna won from Prost, Piquet, Modena, Satoru Nakajima and Aguri Suzuki. This {{would be the last}} Formula One Grand Prix on the streets of downtown Phoenix, Arizona and the last Formula One race in the United States for 9 years; Formula One would return to a very different part of the United States in 2000 – the historic Indianapolis Motor Speedway, that had a whole new road course built within the facility just for the Grand Prix.|$|E

These two events catapulted him to 11th in the points standing, out of the Chase for the Cup. At Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Earnhardt and his crew made a critical decision to stay out on the final pit stop to get a much needed Top 10 finish to move him up to 10th in the points. He made the 2006 Chase for the NEXTEL Cup after finishing 17th in the Chevy Rock and Roll 400 at Richmond International Raceway on September 9, 2006. He came close to winning at Talladega, and was leading on the last lap when Brian Vickers made contact with Earnhardt's future teammate Jimmie Johnson, sending Johnson into Earnhardt and spinning both <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>out.</b> His points position going into the Chase was 6th.
