25|$|Glasgow was a quite {{cosmopolitan}} place. There {{had been}} a Jewish community there for many years, which brought intellectual and cultural energy to the Glasgow society.

In 2017, Professor Amy Adamczyk contended that these cross-national differences in acceptance can be largely explained by three factors: the relative strength of democratic institutions, the level of economic development, and the religious context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> people live.|$|E
25|$|Bình Định was {{probably}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> the Cham first arrived {{in what is now}} Vietnam. Its favourable geography led to the rise of the Cham Port of Thị Nại where Quy Nhon is now located. The city-state of Vijaya was located around this port and the main city, which was further inland. Its centre was in the southern lowland of Bình Định. However, its architecture implies that it did not become important until the eleventh or twelfth century.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the start}} of the Mexican Drug War in 2006, the drug {{trafficking}} organizations have slaughtered their rivals, killed policemen, and now increasingly targeted politicians – especially local leaders. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> these politicians have been killed are areas plagued by drug-related violence. Part of the strategy used by the criminal groups behind the killings of local figures is the weakening of the local governments. Extreme violence puts politicians {{at the mercy of the}} mafias, thus allowing the cartels to take control of the fundamental government structures and expand their criminal agendas.|$|E

2500|$|Before the First World War, Serbia existed as an {{independent}} country before being incorporated into Yugoslavia in 1919. Approximately 16,000 Jews resided there.

Serbia was occupied by Germany in April 1941. As part of their effort to occupy the northern regions of Yugoslavia, the Germans established a military government in Serbia. Serbia's collaborationist government was led by General Milan Nedić. The internal affairs of the Serbian occupied territory were moderated by German racial laws, that were introduced in all occupied territories with immediate effects on the Jewish and Roma populations. Indigenous Serbians who harbored democratic beliefs were also targeted.|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1970s, much of {{the world}} has become more {{accepting}} of same-sex sexuality between partners of legal age. A 2017 book by Professor Amy Adamczyk, published by the University of California Press and based on years of mixed methods research, shows that these cross-national differences in acceptance can be explained by three factors: the strength of democratic institutions, the level of economic development, and the religious context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> people live. The Pew Research Center's 2013 Global Attitudes Survey [...] "finds broad acceptance of homosexuality in North America, the European Union, and much of Latin America, but equally widespread rejection in predominantly Muslim nations and in Africa, as well as in parts of Asia and in Russia". The survey also finds [...] "acceptance of homosexuality is particularly widespread in countries where religion is less central in people's lives. These are also among the richest countries in the world. In contrast, in poorer countries with high levels of religiosity, few believe homosexuality should be accepted by society. Age is also a factor in several countries, with younger respondents offering far more tolerant views than older ones. And while gender differences are not prevalent, in those countries where they are, women are consistently more accepting of homosexuality than men." ...|$|E
