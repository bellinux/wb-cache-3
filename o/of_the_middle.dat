A number of individuals from this class, however, benefited from institutionalized corruption.|$|R

25|$|Overall, {{many social}} critics and intellectuals, {{most of whom}} are members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{professional}} <b>middle</b> class themselves, have commented on the extravagant consumption habits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> professional <b>middle</b> class. It is also often pointed out that <b>the</b> suburban lifestyle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American professional <b>middle</b> class is a major reason for its record consumption. The increasing materialism, even among such a highly educated class, is also often claimed to be connected to <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> rugged individualism which gained popularity among <b>the</b> ranks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> professional <b>middle</b> class in <b>the</b> 1970s and 1980s.|$|R

5|$|In {{terms of}} social class the average American may be {{referred}} to as being either a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> or working class. The discrepancy is largely the result of differing class models and definitions of what constitutes a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> class. Currently the vast majority of Americans self-identify as middle class, yet some experts in the field such Michael Zweig of Stony Brook University or Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University have brought forth different theories. As most Americans are neither professionals nor managers and lack college degrees the average American may be described as being either or both, lower middle and working class.|$|E

5|$|Richard B. Parkinson and Ludwig D. Morenz {{write that}} ancient Egyptian literature—narrowly defined as belles-lettres ("beautiful writing")—was not {{recorded}} in written form {{until the early}} Twelfth dynasty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Kingdom. Old Kingdom texts served mainly to maintain the divine cults, preserve souls in the afterlife, and document accounts for practical uses in daily life. It {{was not until the}} Middle Kingdom that texts were written for the purpose of entertainment and intellectual curiosity. Parkinson and Morenz also speculate that written works <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Kingdom were transcriptions of the oral literature of the Old Kingdom. It is known that some oral poetry was preserved in later writing; for example, litter-bearers' songs were preserved as written verses in tomb inscriptions of the Old Kingdom.|$|E

It was at this time that the use of Olmec ceremonial structures was discontinued and Olmec sculpture was destroyed, signalling an intermediate period prior to the beginning of the city's Early Maya phase. The transition between the two phases was a gradual one, without abrupt changes.|$|E
