5|$|Ancient India, {{particularly}} the centuries {{in which the}} Mahavira and the Buddha lived, were one of intense intellectual debates, especially <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> reality and self or soul. Jain view of soul differs from those found in ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts, and Jain view about jiva and ajiva (self, matter) utilizes anekantavada.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp {{showed the}} highest ever linear {{polarization}} detected for any comet. Such polarization {{is the result}} of solar radiation getting scattered by the dust particles in the coma of the comet and depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the grains. It further confirms that the dust grains in the coma of comet Hale–Bopp were smaller than inferred in any other comet.|$|E
5|$|In the book, Hemingway explores {{conflict}} {{within a}} marriage, {{the conflict between}} the European and native cultures in Africa, and the fear a writer feels when his work becomes impossible.

5|$|Seeds {{are also}} {{released}} spontaneously {{in the absence}} of fire. The degree to which B.serrata trees exhibit bradyspory seems to depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the site where they grow. One study recorded plants at coastal sites having more than 30% of their follicles open, compared to those further inland having fewer than 5% open. Follicles also open when part of the tree dies.|$|E

She reflects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> her marriages {{and looks back}} on her prior self-indulgent lifestyle. She explains to the reader how personal achievement may result from the allure of success, and simultaneously cautions against harmful byproducts of behavioral insecurity inherent in the mystique of celebrity.|$|E

5|$|The {{proposal}} that {{one type of}} organism could descend from another type goes back {{to some of the}} first pre-Socratic Greek philosophers, such as Anaximander and Empedocles.

5|$|Workers use several {{different}} strategies {{to deal with}} their dead, including burying, cannibalism, and avoiding a corpse altogether. To avoid pathogens, termites occasionally engage in necrophoresis, in which a nestmate carries away a corpse from the colony to dispose of it elsewhere.

5|$|Almost {{all members}} of the Council are members of a {{political}} party at national level, and most of these are members of a European-level political party. However the Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than political parties and the nature of coalition governments {{in a number of states}} means that individual configurations would vary on which domestic party was assigned the portfolio. However the broad ideological alignment of each state does have a bearing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the law the Council produces and the extent to which the link between domestic parties puts pressure on the members in the European Parliament to vote a certain way.|$|E
5|$|Although Robert {{condemned}} Gilbert Porrée {{in conjunction}} with Peter Lombard, he {{did not agree with}} Lombard's Christology, or views <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> Jesus Christ. Likewise, although he disagreed with some of Abelard's teachings, he defended Abelard against charges of heresy. Robert did, however, agree with some of Abelard's teachings and methods. The introduction to the Sententiae proclaims Robert's desire to harmonise the writings of two unnamed scholars, who have been identified by modern writers as Hugh of St Victor and Abelard.|$|E

5|$|Archimedes' Book of Lemmas or Liber Assumptorum is a {{treatise}} with fifteen propositions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> circles. The earliest known copy of {{the text}} is in Arabic. The scholars T. L. Heath and Marshall Clagett argued that it cannot {{have been written by}} Archimedes in its current form, since it quotes Archimedes, suggesting modification by another author. The Lemmas may be based on an earlier work by Archimedes that is now lost.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} below, Apollonius' {{problem has}} ten special cases, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the three given objects, {{which may be}} a circle (C), line (L) or point (P).

5|$|Epicurus (341 – 270 BC) {{anticipated}} {{the idea of}} natural selection. The Roman philosopher and atomist Lucretius (c. 99 – 55 BC) explicated these ideas in his poem De rerum natura (<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> Things). In the Epicurean system, {{it was assumed that}} many living forms had been spontaneously generated from Gaia in the past, but that only the most functional forms had survived to have offspring. The Epicureans did not anticipate the full theory of evolution as we now know it, but seem to have postulated separate abiogenetic events for each species.|$|E

By 1938, the couple had drifted apart, as both focused heavily on their work, although Goddard was again his leading lady in his next feature film, The Great Dictator. She eventually divorced Chaplin in Mexico in 1942, citing incompatibility and separation for more than a year.|$|E
5|$|Glycerophospholipids, usually {{referred}} to as phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, {{as well as being}} involved in metabolism and cell signaling. Neural tissue (including the brain) contains relatively high amounts of glycerophospholipids, and alterations in their composition has been implicated in various neurological disorders. Glycerophospholipids may be subdivided into distinct classes, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the polar headgroup at the sn-3 position of the glycerol backbone in eukaryotes and eubacteria, or the sn-1 position in the case of archaebacteria.|$|E
5|$|Halley was {{the first}} comet to be {{recognized}} as periodic. Until the Renaissance, the philosophical consensus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> comets, promoted by Aristotle, was that they were disturbances in Earth's atmosphere. This idea was disproved in 1577 by Tycho Brahe, who used parallax measurements to show that comets must lie beyond the Moon. Many were still unconvinced that comets orbited the Sun, and assumed instead that they must follow straight paths through the Solar System.|$|E
