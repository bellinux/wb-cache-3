500|$|The {{song was}} at the centre of a {{controversy}} surrounding [...] "ninety-minute bigots", an expression allegedly coined by former Rangers chairman Sir David Murray: [...] "Ninety-minute Bigots do not hold beliefs but nonetheless sing songs at football matches which are sectarian, simply to join in {{with the rest of}} the crowd." [...] Rangers have adopted several measures to tackle this behaviour including attempts to bring older Rangers songs back into popular use, with Murray speaking out against the singing of the [...] "Billy Boys" [...] on many occasions. In 2006, Rangers were charged by UEFA for discriminatory chanting over the singing of [...] "Billy Boys" [...] during a UEFA Champions League game against Villarreal. Rangers were found not guilty due to [...] "Billy Boys" [...] having been sung for years without the SFA or the Scottish government intervening against it and ruled that it was tolerated as a social and historic song. However, after an appeal where they were warned, Rangers were ordered by UEFA to make a public announcement at all home games, prohibiting the singing of the song despite UEFA admitting they were unable to do anything about it because it was a Scottish social issue. In 2011, [...] "Billy Boys" [...] was included in a list of chants that had been banned from Scottish football grounds as part of new legislation from the Scottish government. It was specifically banned because of its [...] "Up to <b>our</b> <b>knees</b> in Fenian blood" [...] line. It was banned because it was decided by the Scottish government that [...] "Fenian" [...] in the context of the song meant Roman Catholics and was thus sectarian despite Rangers fans stating that it meant Irish republicans or fans of their Old Firm rivals, Celtic.|$|E
2500|$|The literal {{translation}} of line number 9 is [...] "But we bend <b>our</b> <b>knees</b> and bow down and express thanks". The Sefardic/Mizrahi tradition shortens this line to ואנחנוּמשׁתּחום—Va'anchnu mishtachavim—"But we bow down". The quotation in lines 18–21 is Deuteronomy 4:39.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the final}} match at The Oval as defeat became eminent for the English side, Grieg kneeled down {{on to the}} pitch smiling and {{performed}} a ‘grovel’ crawl on the ground.

The West Indies batsman Viv Richards remarked “In other words, he was going to have us down on <b>our</b> <b>knees,</b> begging for mercy!

But on the High Holy Days of Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, the worshipper will not merely flex and bend, but will actually get down on his knees at those words, and some Sefardic and Mizrahi congregants will prostrate themselves on the floor (in those synagogues with sufficient floor space).|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{rare and}} devastating {{complication}} following {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) revision reconstruction is femoral fracture.     Case presentation: A 35 -year old male soccer player {{with a history of}} ACL tear from the previous year ago, who underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction and functioned well until another similar injury caused ACL re-rupture.  Revision of ACL reconstruction was performed and after failure of graft tension during the pumping, a fluoroscopic assessment showed a femoral condyle fracture. The patient referred to <b>our</b> <b>knee</b> clinic and was operated on in two stages: first fixation of the fracture and then ACL re-revision after fracture healing was complete.  Conclusions: Not inserting multiple guide pins, keeping a safe distance from the posterior cortex and giving more attention during graft tensioning, especially in revision surgeries, are all small points that can reduce the risk of fracture during the revision of ACL reconstructio...|$|R
2500|$|There {{was in the}} {{laboratory}} a large tank of good-sized turtles being used experimentally to test the claims of a commercially minded enthusiast who wanted to market a turtle vaccine to immunize humans against tuberculosis.

[...] I sold the idea to other members of the class and soon we had chalk lanes mapped out on the floor, a turtle with a number on its back assigned to each member, and were down on <b>our</b> <b>knees,</b> snapping our fingers, and exhorting our respective turtles to hurry up and win the race.|$|E

5000|$|Adoration is {{a willing}} {{submission}} of self to God expressed interiorly {{as well as}} exteriorly by one's actions. It is an interior act of mind and will where the mind humbly admits that God's perfection is infinite, and the will moves one us to worship this perfection. An acknowledge of God's right as God to be Lord of one's life and in control of it involves a voluntarily offer of submission. Thomas Aquinas says: [...] "Adoration is primarily an interior reverence for God expressing itself secondarily in bodily signs of humility: bending <b>our</b> <b>knee</b> (to express <b>our</b> weakness compared to God) and prostrating ourselves (to show that of ourselves we are nothing)." [...] Genuflecting is an outward gesture of an inward attitude of adoration towards God, as is the praying of the Pater Noster. [...] "The first phrase of the Our Father is a blessing of adoration before it is a supplication. For it is the glory of God that we should recognize Him as [...] "Father," [...] the true God".|$|R
