40|$|A {{critical}} element {{for the success}} of corporate governance is the effective segregation <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> <b>in</b> the internal control environment. However, a standard for segregation <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> roles is still lacking both in theory and practice. This paper develops a framework for achieving effective segregation <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> <b>in</b> the internal control environment.

The framework has implications for companies looking to automate the resolution <b>of</b> segregation <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> and reduce costs. From an assurance standpoint, auditors can benefit from the framework to increase efficiency and reduce audit costs. We provide extensions of the current study.
