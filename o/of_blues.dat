5|$|Dark Horse {{failed to}} {{place on the}} UK's Top 50 Albums Chart. This {{was not only a}} poor result for a former Beatle – {{although}} Starr's Beaucoups <b>of</b> <b>Blues</b> had similarly not charted in 1970 – but a dramatic turnaround in Harrison's commercial fortunes, after his three previous solo releases (including The Concert for Bangladesh live album) had all made number 1 or 2 in Britain.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to optimise the yield percentage <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> lupins in mixed cropping systems. Field experiments were conducted at two locations in Northern Germany (Institute of Organic Farming near Hamburg and Institute of Plant and Soil Science at Braunschweig). Two types <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> lupins, the determinate and branched type were cultivated together with spring barley, spring wheat or fodder peas in different seeding ratios (SR) : 50 % : 50 %, 62, 5 % : 37, 5 % and 75 % : 25 % of the respective pure cropping seeding rate. We present data on total grain yield, yield <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> lupins, yield percentage <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> lupins, protein content, and protein yield. Total grain yield decreased with increasing SR <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> lupins whereas, in contrast, the yield <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> lupins, protein content and protein yield increased. This shows the low competitive ability <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> lupins against the mixed cropping partners, particularly cereals. Therefore, the yield percentage <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> lupins in mixed cropping with cereals did not reach more than 25 %. From the view of plant production and the purpose of animal nutrition the percentage of grain legumes should be higher and comparable to those of other crop mixtures like peas with spring barley or beans with oat...|$|R

5|$|Glastonbury {{was heavily}} {{influenced}} by hippie ethics and the free festival movement in the early 1970s, beginning with the Isle of Wight Festival, which featured performances by The Who, amongst many other artists. Organiser Michael Eavis decided to host the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open-air concert headlined by Led Zeppelin at the 1970 Bath Festival <b>of</b> <b>Blues</b> and Progressive Music at the nearby Bath and West Showground in 1970. The festival retains vestiges of this tradition such as the Green Fields area, encompassing the Green Futures and Healing Field.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metal {{is a form}} {{of music}} {{characterized}} by aggressive, driving rhythms and highly amplified distorted guitars, generally with grandiose lyrics and virtuosic instrumentation. Heavy metal is a development <b>of</b> <b>blues,</b> blues rock, rock and prog rock. Its origins lie in the British hard rock bands who between 1967 and 1974 took blues and rock and created a hybrid with a heavy, guitar-and-drums-centered sound. Most of the pioneers in the field, like Black Sabbath, were English, though many were inspired by American performers like Blue Cheer and Jimi Hendrix.|$|E

5|$|In March 1962 the Blue Boys {{read about}} the Ealing Jazz Club in Jazz News newspaper, which {{mentioned}} Alexis Korner's rhythm and blues band, Blues Incorporated. The group sent a tape of their best recordings to Korner, who was favourably impressed and visited Ealing Jazz Club on 7 April where they met the members <b>of</b> <b>Blues</b> Incorporated, who included the slide guitarist Brian Jones, the keyboardist Ian Stewart and the drummer Charlie Watts. After a meeting with Korner, Jagger and Richards started jamming with the group.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the popular jazz and swing music listened to by mainstream America, {{there were a number}} of other genres that were popular among certain groups of people—e.g., minorities or rural audiences. Beginning in the 1920s and accelerating greatly in the 1940s, the blues began rapidly diversifying into a broad spectrum of new styles. These included an uptempo, energetic style called rhythm and blues (R), a merger <b>of</b> <b>blues</b> and Anglo-Celtic song called country music and the fusion of hymns and spirituals with blues structures called gospel music. Later than these other styles, in the 1940s, a blues, R and country fusion eventually called rock and roll developed, eventually coming to dominate American popular by the beginning of the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|L.A. Woman is {{the sixth}} studio album by the American rock band the Doors, {{released}} on April 19, 1971, on Elektra Records.

It saw the band continue to integrate elements <b>of</b> <b>blues</b> back into their music, a direction begun with their previous album, Morrison Hotel. It was also recorded without record producer Paul A. Rothchild after he fell out with the group over the perceived lack of quality of their studio performances. Subsequently, the band co-produced the album with longtime sound engineer Bruce Botnick.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{of the use}} of {{the word}} 'cyan' ( [...] , [...] ), which can also mean 'blue' in Greek, the exact shade <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> remains ambiguous. Although it implies the use of a light shade <b>of</b> <b>blue,</b> such as on the flag of the United Nations, the colours of the Greek flag tend to be darker, {{especially}} during the dictatorship and in recent years, with the exception of the years of the rule of King Otto, when a very light shade <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> was used. Consequently, the shade <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> is largely left to the flagmakers to decide, as shown in the table below.|$|R
5|$|Led Zeppelin II is the eponymous second studio album by the English {{rock band}} Led Zeppelin, {{released}} on 22 October 1969 in the United States and on 31 October 1969 in the United Kingdom by Atlantic Records. Recording sessions for the album {{took place at}} several locations in both the United Kingdom and North America from January to August 1969. The album's production was credited to the band's lead guitarist and songwriter Jimmy Page, and it also served as Led Zeppelin's first album to utilise the recording techniques of the engineer Eddie Kramer. Incorporating several elements <b>of</b> <b>blues</b> and folk music, Led Zeppelin II exhibited the band's evolving musical style of blues-derived material and their guitar riff-based sound.

50|$|Light is {{transmitted}} to the retina through the lens. In humans, the amount of light transmitted by the lens is age-dependent. In young children, more than 65% <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> light {{is transmitted}}. This transmission rate decreases over time; at age 25, only 20% <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> light is {{transmitted to the}} retina. The decreased transmission <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> light occurs as our eye’s lens naturally yellows and absorbs more blue light over time, thus preventing blue light from reaching the retina. As {{a result of this}} natural process, younger people are more susceptible to the effects <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> light.|$|R
