5|$|In 1697 Gale {{translated}} Louis Jobert's La science des medailles into English, {{with the}} title <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Knowledge</b> of Medals. This was designed as an instruction to the beginning coin collector, and also contained information to protect the new collector from fraud. Gale then in 1709 published his father's work on the Antonine Itinerary, which Gale supplemented with his own notes and commentary. His last major published work was as {{the editor of a}} 12th-century manuscript register of the Honour of Richmond that was contained in the Cotton library. He also contributed a number of essays on antiquarian topics to the Philosopical Transactions journal put out by the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|In another study, {{students}} who read less-organized material performed better that students given organized material on tasks that required an application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> to problem-solving. This {{suggests that the}} inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when trainees are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the core material is and, therefore, the recall {{will not be as}} good and more errors will occur. This distortion can lead to a richer understanding of the material and facilitate transfer performance because trainees are required to form a macro structure of the instructional material. Research using the dual-coding paradigm also suggests that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and leads to deeper processing of information because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. When information is made easier to comprehend, material is processed less deeply, thus leading to poorer acquisition of information.|$|E
5|$|The {{decipherment}} {{and recovery}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Maya writing {{has been a}} long and laborious process. Some elements were first deciphered in the late 19th and early 20th century, mostly the parts having to do with numbers, the Maya calendar, and astronomy. Major breakthroughs were made from the 1950s to 1970s, and accelerated rapidly thereafter. By the end of the 20th century, scholars were able to read the majority of Maya texts, and ongoing work continues to further illuminate the content.|$|E
