5|$|A 2013 {{study by}} Joseph E. Peterson and colleagues {{identified}} lesions in skulls of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs, which were interpreted as infections caused by trauma. Lesions {{were found on}} 22% of sampled pachycephalosaur skulls (a frequency consistent across genera), but were absent from flat-headed specimens (which have been interpreted as juveniles or females), {{which is consistent with}} use in intra-specific combat (for territory or mates). The distribution of lesions in these animals tended to concentrate at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dome,</b> which supports head-butting behaviour. Flank-butting would probably result in fewer injuries, which would instead be concentrated on the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dome.</b> These observations were made while comparing the lesions with those on the skulls and flanks of modern sheep skeletons. The researchers noted that modern head-butting animals use their weapons for both combat and display, and that pachycephalosaurs could therefore also have used their domes for both. Displaying a weapon and willingness to use it can be enough to settle disputes in some animals.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{characteristics}} of bricks used in <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> <b>of</b> some historic bath buildings dated to 15 th century in Izmir were determined {{in order to}} indicate <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> repair bricks {{that will be used}} in <b>the</b> conservation works <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>domes.</b> For this purpose, their basic physical properties, elemental and mineralogical compositions, firing temperatures and microstructural properties were determined by using XRF, XRD, SEM-EDS and TGA analysis. Analysis results indicated that <b>the</b> bricks are <b>of</b> low density, high porosity and were produced from raw materials containing low amounts of calcium poor clays fired at low temperatures (<. 900. °C).

40|$|<b>The</b> shape <b>of</b> seven large <b>domes</b> on <b>the</b> plains <b>of</b> Venus, with volumes between 100 and 1000 cu km, is {{compared}} with that of an axisymmetric gravity current spreading over a rigid horizontal surface. Both the altimetric profiles and <b>the</b> horizontal projection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> intersection <b>of</b> <b>domes</b> on <b>the</b> SAR images agree well with the theoretical similarity solution for a newtonian fluid, but not with the shape calculated for a rigid-plastic rheology, nor with that for a static model with a strong skin. As a viscous current spreads, it generates an isotropic strain rate tensor whose magnitude is independent of radius. Such a flow can account for the randomly oriented cracks that are uniformly distributed on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>domes.</b> <b>The</b> stress induced by the flow in the plains material below is obtained, and is probably large enough to produce the short radial cracks in <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plains beyond <b>the</b> <b>domes.</b> <b>The</b> viscosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> can be estimated from their thermal time constants if spreading is possible only when the fluid is hot, and lies between 10 (exp 14) and 10 (exp 17) Pa s. Laboratory experiments show that such viscosities correspond to temperatures of 610 - 690 C in dry rhyolitic magmas. These temperatures agree with laboratory measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solidus temperature <b>of</b> wet rhyolite. These results show that <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> can be understood using simple fluid dynamical ideas, and that the magmas involved can be produced by wet melting at depths below 10 km, followed by eruption and degassing...|$|R

5|$|Roman domes {{were used}} in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. Oculi were common features. They were customarily {{hemispherical}} in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior.

A variety of other shapes, including shallow saucer domes, segmental domes, and ribbed domes were also sometimes used. The audience halls of many imperial palaces were domed. Domes were also very common over polygonal garden pavilions. Construction and development of domes declined in the west with the decline {{and fall of the}} western portion of the empire.|$|E
5|$|The Ayyubid {{period in}} Jerusalem {{following}} its conquest by Saladin {{was marked by}} a huge investment {{in the construction of}} houses, markets, public bathes, and pilgrim hostels.

The mihrab of the al-Aqsa Mosque was repaired and in 1217, al-Mu'azzam Isa built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates. The Dome of the Ascension was also built and restoration work was done to the existing free-standing domes of the Temple Mount.|$|E
40|$|In {{southeast}} Karakorum (northwest Himalaya, Pakistan), kilometric size migmatitic domes were exhumed in {{a context}} of north-south shortening during Neogene times. <b>The</b> <b>domes</b> are characterized by a conical shape, and ductile deformation criteria indicate both radial expansion and extrusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> migmatitic core relative to the surrounding gneisses. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> are aligned along the dextral, strike-slip Shigar fault that is parallel to the N 130 °E Karakorum fault. Along the Shigar fault, exhumation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> is mainly vertical with a slight dextral component. We propose that the high temperature exhumation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> is due to diapiric ascent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molten mid-crust helped by the compressive regime. <b>The</b> localization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial diapir was controlled by crustal-scale vertical structures parallel to the Karakorum fault. <b>The</b> later stage <b>of</b> exhumation in mid to low temperature conditions was related to the uplift and erosion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole southeastern Karakorum by crustal-scale east-west folding. In south Tibet, <b>the</b> westward prolongation <b>of</b> south Karakorum, Neogene crustal melting is also supported by geophysical data and volcanism, but mid-crustal rocks have not been exhumed. This difference between <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> exhumation in south Karakorum and south Tibet could be related to <b>the</b> transpressive context <b>of</b> south Karakorum inducing a strain partitioning between the N 130 °E faults and east-west folding. Such partitioning produces heterogeneous uplift in this area. Moreover, zones of rapid uplift rate are associated with erosion due to the high incision rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large Shyok and Braldu rivers and the large Biafo-Hispar and Concordia glaciers in south Karakorum...|$|R
