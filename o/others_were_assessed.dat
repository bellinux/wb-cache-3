However, little is known about factors that might contribute to dyadic adjustment problems in MS. In the present study, we predicted that MS patients showing evidence of three common sequelae of MS / depression symptoms, fatigue and cognitive dysfunction / would be most likely to display problems with dyadic adjustment. Sixty-four MS patients and 49 significant <b>others</b> <b>were</b> <b>assessed.</b> Patient-reported dyadic adjustment was significantly (P at least B/ 0. 05) associated with depression (r// 0. 48) and fatigue (r// 0. 31), but not cognitive functioning.

40|$|We {{recorded}} {{responses of}} the gerbil basilar membrane (BM) to wideband tone complexes. The intensity of one component was varied and the effects on the amplitude and phase of the <b>others</b> <b>were</b> <b>assessed.</b> This suppression paradigm enabled us to vary probe frequency and suppressor frequency independently, allowing the use of simple scaling arguments to analyze the spatial buildup of the nonlinear interaction between traveling waves. Most suppressors had the same effects on probe amplitude and phase as did wideband intensity in-crements. The main exception were suppressors above the characteristic frequency (CF) of the recording location, for which the frequency range of most affected probes was not constant, but shifted upward with suppressor frequency. BM displacement reliably pre-dicted the effectiveness of low-side suppressors, but not high-side suppressors. We found “anti-suppression ” of probes well below CF, i. e., suppressor-induced enhance-ment of probe response amplitude. Large (91 cycle) phase effects occurred for above-CF probes. Phase shifts varied nonmonotonically, but systematically, with sup-pressor level, probe frequency, and suppressor frequen-cy, reconciling apparent discrepancies in the literature. The analysis of spatial buildup revealed an accumulation of local effects on the propagation of the traveling wave, with larger BM displacement reducing the local forward gain. The propagation speed of the wave was also affected. With larger BM displacement, the basal portion of the wave slowed down, while the apical part sped up. This framework of spatial buildup of local effects unifies the widely different effects of overall intensity, low-side suppressors, and high-side suppressors on BM responses...|$|E

40|$|There {{number of}} of {{children}} with special needs in kindergartens is increasing. In order to ensure proper development to these children, educational system should be aware of this situation. The purpose of this thesis is the analysis of social skills of a child with Down syndrome compared to its peers, observing five respective areas of socialization: identity, capability of self control, self acknowledgement, social relations and social rules. The task involved 12 children aged two to three years, among which there is one child with Down syndrome. Social competence was measured by a scale for assessing children's social maturation (modified after Lidija Kastelic). Each child was individually assessed in its familiar environment (the playing room). Some variables were observed during playing, feeding or personal care, while <b>others</b> <b>were</b> <b>assessed</b> giving children an individual question, for example: “Where is your head?” I myself assessed children through the whole course. This means that all the children were assessed under the same conditions and the same criteria were maintained throughout the course. The results show that the child with the Down syndrome poorly developed social competence. Namely, he has problems with self-control, he eats much slower than its peers, does not accept losing without excessive emotional response and laughs at inappropriate moments. In addition he has some problems with the social rules, since he does not use polite words like “thank you” and “please”. In the case of social contacts he does not exchange toys and does not participate in group play. However, in the case of identity and self acknowledgement, his results are comparable to results of his peers. ...|$|E

Oxaliplatin, carboplatin, cisplatin and gemcitabine were significantly less cytotoxic to 5637 R cells compared to the 5637 cells. In contrast, doxorubicin, methotrexate and vinblastine had no cell line dependent difference in cytotoxicity. Upon exposure to therapeutically relevant doses of oxaliplatin, 5637 R cells had lower drug-DNA adduct levels than 5637 cells. This difference was partially accounted for by pre-DNA damage mechanisms such as drug uptake and intracellular inactivation by glutathione, as well as faster oxaliplatin-DNA adduct repair. In contrast, both cell lines had no significant differences in carboplatin cell uptake, efflux and drug-DNA adduct formation and repair, suggesting distinct resistance mechanisms for these two closely related drugs. The functional studies were augmented by RNAseq analysis, which demonstrated a significant change in expression of 83 transcripts, including 50 known genes and 22 novel transcripts. Most of the transcripts were not previously associated with bladder cancer chemoresistance. This model system and the associated phenotypic and genotypic data has the potential to identify some novel details of resistance mechanisms of clinical importance to bladder cancer...|$|E
40|$|Cross-cultural {{research}} on moral development has documented reliable cultural differences in people’s evaluations {{of moral and}} immoral actions. Prosocial actions are typically viewed as more obligatory and less discretionary in collectivistic cultures relative to individualistic cultures. While past research mostly focused on moral judgments, it largely neglected moral emotions. The present study was aimed at investigating self- and other-evaluative emotions following (im) moral actions in different situational and cultural contexts. It investigated moral emotion expectancies of Canadian and Chinese {{adolescents and young adults}} across different situational contexts. For each culture, 179 Canadian and 193 Chinese adolescents from grade levels 7 - 8, 10 - 11 and 1 st- 2 nd year university filled out a questionnaire. Participants were provided with 16 different scenarios depicting moral and immoral actions of self and others in either prosocial or moral contexts. Emotional expectations about themselves and <b>others</b> <b>were</b> <b>assessed</b> following each scenario by asking adolescents to rate various positively as well as negatively charged self- and other evaluative emotions (pride, satisfaction, guilt, shame, admiration, respect, contempt, anger). Obligation/ discretion ratings and Horizontal/Vertical Collectivism-Individualism scales were measured. The main assumptions of cultural differences were confirmed in the present study that Chinese were more likely to hold a collectivist cultural view with more obligations in prosocial contexts and Canadians were more likely to hold an individualist view with more personal discretion in prosocial contexts. In a mixed model ANOVA, significant interactions between situational context (prosocial/moral), types of action (rule abiding/rule conforming) and culture were found for both self- and other-evaluative emotions. Canadian participants expressed more intense negative self-evaluative emotions relative to Chinese participants, in particular in the prosocial context. By contrast, Chinese participants expressed more negative other-evaluative emotions than Canadian participants when confronted with the rule-violating behavior of others in both prosocial and moral contexts. However, regression analyses did not find cross-cultural differences in predicting other-evaluative emotions from self-evaluative emotions in prosocial contexts. Overall, the study points to systematic cultural differences in moral emotions; however, these differences were only partially attributable to moral judgment...|$|E

40|$|Imidazoquinolines are {{powerful}} immunostimulants (IMMS) that function through Toll-like receptors, particularly TLR 7 and TLR 8. In addition to enhancing the immune response, IMMS also function as antineoplastic drugs and vaccine adjuvants. These small compounds display {{almost the same}} molecular structure, except in some cases in which atom in position 1 varies and changes the imidazole characteristics. A variable acyclic side chain is also always attached at atom in position 2, while another chain may be attached at atom in position 1. These structural differences alter immune responses, such as the production of interferon regulatory factor and nuclear factor-κB (IRF-NFκB). In this work, quantum mechanics theory and computational chemistry methods were applied to study the physicochemical properties of the crystal binding site of TLR 8 complexed with the following six IMMS molecules: Hybrid- 2, XG 1 - 236, DS 802, CL 075, CL 097 and R 848 (resiquimod). The PDB IDs of the crystals were: 4 R 6 A, 4 QC 0, 4 QBZ, 3 W 3 K, 3 W 3 J, and 3 W 3 N respectively. Thus, were calculated, the total energy, solvation energy, interaction energy (instead of free energy) {{of the system and}} interaction energy of the polar region of the IMMS. Additionally, the dipole moment, electrostatic potential, polar surface, atomic charges, hydrogen bonds, and polar and hydrophobic interactions, among <b>others,</b> <b>were</b> <b>assessed.</b> Together, these properties revealed important differences among the six TLR 8 -immunostimulant complexes, reflected as different interaction energies and therefore different electrostatic environments and binding energies. Remarkably, the interaction energy of a defined polar region composed of the highly polarized N 3, N 5 atoms and the N 11 amino group, acted as a polar pharmacophore that correlates directly with the reported immunopharmacological potency of the six complexed molecules. Based on these results, it was concluded that accurate physicochemical analysis of the crystal binding site could reveal the binding energy (measured as interaction energy) and associated molecular mechanism of action between IMMS and TLR 8. These findings may facilitate the development and design of improved small molecules with IMMS properties that are targeted to the TLR system and have enhanced pharmacological effectiveness and reduced toxicity...|$|E
40|$|Received 8 April, 2009; Accepted 27 May, 2009) AbstractBackground and purpose: Radiographic film repeat rate {{assessment}} is performed to appropriate profiting of existence resources in therapeutic wards. Multiple exposures of x-ray generators due to repeated radiographic examination {{can lead to}} amortization of the radiographic facilities and decrease their longevity and also increases the cost of facilities repair. On the other hand, its therapeutic services are necessary {{to be carried out}} for patients as soon as possible. Recognition of radiographic film repeat rate and its related causes will help to eliminate the problems and are cost effective. Materials and methods: In this descriptive study, samples were garnered with data collection and non random model during three months in eight radiographic rooms and four darkrooms belonging to four governmental hospitals, namely Imam Khomeini, Booali Sina, Fatemh Zahra and Zare in Sari. All rejected radiographic films were seen by resident experts in each center and information was entered into designed forms. Radiographic repeat rates were calculated through data available from all recipients and the number of used films. In this article, related causes responsible for repeated radiographic examination including errors in selection of exposure factors (over exposure and under exposure), positioning, centering, film size, equipment, processing or darkroom, movement and <b>others</b> <b>were</b> <b>assessed.</b> Results: In four hospitals, 36, 758 films were received during investigation and the number of repeated films was 2, 155 (5. 9 % were estimated as radiographic repeat rate). The maximum repeat rate belonged to Booali sina Hospital (7. 2 %) and the minimum one was Zare Hospital (0. 7 %). The most important causes were due to over exposure selection (1. 4 %) and the least one was due to improper selection of film size (0. 08 %). The percentage of other factors include, under exposure selection (1. 12 %), centering (0. 92 %), others (0. 84 %), darkroom (0. 78 %), positioning (0. 32 %), equipment (0. 27 %), and movement (0. 14 %). Conclusion: This study indicates that radiographic repeat rate is reasonable for governmental hospitals in Sari, rather than other published data. Booali Sina hospital has more repeat rates caused by movement factor during radiographic examination than other centers. As a matter of fact, Zare hospital has the least radiographic repeat rate. In order to decrease radiographic repeat rate and avoiding extra payment, one should educate the inexperienced staff, perform quality control of x-ray generator sets and processors regularly and also select appropriate diagrams of exposure factors.
