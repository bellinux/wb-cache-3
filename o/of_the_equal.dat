5|$|It {{has been}} argued that this results in the {{different}} treatment of persons in like situations, and thus violates Article 12(1). Although a rational connection exists between the classification adopted and the legislative object, the effect of an under-inclusive classification is to accord different treatment to persons similarly placed. However, the courts have often justified under-inclusiveness on the ground that the legislature is free to recognize degrees of harm, to confine its restrictions to cases where the need is felt to be the greatest, and to advance its policies step by step. Despite this, resort to legislative wisdom to justify under-inclusiveness, if used indiscriminately, may result in the watering down <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> protection guarantee provided by Article 12(1).|$|E
5|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{concurrence}} which {{stated that}} Congress {{was very careful}} to base the changes to the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority. Kennedy states that {{is all that is}} needed to decide the case, but that the Court went further than was necessary when it decided that Congress had the power under the constitution to authorize tribes to prosecute non-member Indians. Finally, Kennedy was concerned that the court did not address the question <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Equal</b> Protection Clause. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.|$|E

Harris and A. Leon Higginbotham joined as partners. In 1955 J. Austin Norris, a prominent African-American political figure, joined the firm, which was then known as Norris, Schmidt, Green, Harris, & Higginbotham. The firm was the first African-American law firm in Philadelphia. The firm, which never numbered {{more than a dozen}} lawyers at a given time, produced four federal judges; Higginbotham, Green, and Herbert Hutton all served on the District Court (Higginbotham was later elevated to the Third Circuit), and William Hall was the first African American appointed as a federal magistrate judge. In addition, two members of the firm, Dorris Harris and Harvey Schmidt, were elected judges of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, and William Brown was appointed by President Nixon to be chair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Equal</b> Employment Opportunity Commission.|$|E

40|$|A {{cumulative}} body {{of research}} has shown that children typically shift from an operational to a relational conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign as they move through schooling.

5|$|Once {{the right}} to vote was secured, Stevens turned her {{attention}} to women's legal status. She supported passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Equal</b> Rights Amendment and worked with Alice Paul from 1927–1933 on a volume of work comparing varying impact on law for women and men. The goal in compiling the data was to obtain an international law protecting women's right of citizenship. The research was completed with the help of feminists in 90 countries and evaluated laws controlling women's nationality from every country. Gaining approval for the work from the League of Nations in 1927, Stevens presented the proposal Pan American Union in 1928, convincing the governing body to create the Inter-American Commission of Women (CIM). In 1931, she joined the American Institute of International Law, becoming its first female member. In 1933, her work resulted in the first treaty to secure international rights for women. The Convention on the Nationality of Women established that women retained their citizenship after marriage and Convention on Nationality provided that neither marriage nor divorce could affect the nationality of the members of a family, extending citizenship protection to children.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978) {{that affirmative action}} {{in the form of}} racial quotas in public {{university}} admissions was a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; however, race could be used as one of several factors without violating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Equal</b> Protection Clause or Title VI. In Gratz v. Bollinger (2003) and Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), the Court considered two race-conscious admissions systems at the University of Michigan. The university claimed that its goal in its admissions systems was to achieve racial diversity. In Gratz, the Court struck down a points-based undergraduate admissions system that added points for minority status, finding that its rigidity violated the Equal Protection Clause; in Grutter, the Court upheld a race-conscious admissions process for the university's law school that used race as one of many factors to determine admission. In Fisher v. University of Texas (2013), the Court ruled that before race {{can be used in a}} public university's admission policy, there must be no workable race-neutral alternative. In Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (2014), the Court upheld the constitutionality of a state constitutional prohibition on the state or local use of affirmative action.|$|E

40|$|Young {{children}} often develop a partial, operational understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign {{that refers to}} completing an action, such as getting the answer to an addition or multiplication question, and fail to develop a relational understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign as a symbol that denotes equivalence. A partial view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign as an operator can be <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> primary-age pupils’ overexposure to canonical equations such as a+b=c. This paper presents a preliminary analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different syntaxes and formats used to present equality statements in the Grade 1 textbooks in Greece. The quantitative analysis reveals an overemphasis on presenting <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign within canonical equations. However, qualitative analysis reveals that <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign is first introduced in a context that conveys <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> equivalence relation and is presented within an interesting mix of symbolic and non-symbolic contexts which may minimise the tendency to interpret <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign exclusively as an operator...|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in <b>the</b> Journal <b>of</b> Experimental Child Psychology [© Elsevier]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] sophisticated and flexible understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign is important for arithmetic competence and for learning further mathematics, particularly algebra. Research has identified two common conceptions held by children: <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign as an operator, and <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign as signalling the same value on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equation. We argue here {{that as well as}} these two conceptions, <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> substitution is also an important part of a sophisticated understanding of mathematical equivalence. We provide evidence from a cross-cultural study in which English and Chinese children were asked to rate <b>the</b> “cleverness” <b>of</b> operational, sameness and substitutive definitions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign. A Principle Components Analysis revealed the substitutive items were distinct from the sameness items.
