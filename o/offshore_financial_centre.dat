5|$|Penfold's next {{overseas}} posting was to Kampala, Uganda, {{as deputy}} high commissioner. There, he persuaded President Milton Obote {{to attend the}} queen's birthday party for the first time. Two months later, Obote was overthrown in a coup, after which Penfold led an evacuation of foreign citizens to Kenya. The high commission remained open, and Penfold was still present six months later when a second coup took place. In 1987, he again returned to the FCO, this time serving in the West Indian and Atlantic Department, and four years later, he was appointed Governor of the British Virgin Islands. The main issues of Penfold's tenure were {{the establishment of the}} territory as an <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centre</b> and the smuggling of drugs through its waters until the sudden death of the chief minister. Penfold resolved the subsequent constitutional crisis by appointing the deputy chief minister as an interim replacement. Penfold's term as governor expired in 1996, after which he spent a year as a drugs adviser to the Caribbean before being appointed High Commissioner to Sierra Leone in 1997. Six weeks into Penfold's term, President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah was overthrown in a military coup and Penfold organised an evacuation of foreign citizens.|$|E

25|$|Macau is an <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centre,</b> a tax haven, and a {{free port}} with no foreign {{exchange}} control regimes. The Monetary Authority of Macau regulates offshore finance, while the Macau Trade and Investment Promotion Institute provides services for investment in Macau. In 2007, Moody's Investors Service upgraded Macau's foreign and local currency government issuer ratings to 'Aa3' from 'A1', citing its government's solid finances as a large net creditor. The rating agency also upgraded Macau's foreign currency bank deposit ceiling to 'Aa3' from 'A1'.|$|E
25|$|Bermuda is an <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centre,</b> {{which results}} from its minimal {{standards}} of business regulation/laws and direct taxation on personal or corporate income. It {{has one of}} the highest consumption taxes in the world and taxes all imports in lieu of an income tax system. Bermuda's consumption tax is equivalent to local income tax to local residents and funds government and infrastructure expenditures. The local tax system depends upon import duties, payroll taxes and consumption taxes. The legal system is derived from that of the United Kingdom, with recourse to English courts of final appeal. Foreign private individuals cannot easily open bank accounts or subscribe to mobile phone or internet services.|$|E

5000|$|Although most <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> {{originally}} rose {{to prominence}} by facilitating structures which helped to minimise exposure to tax, tax avoidance {{has played a}} decreasing role {{in the success of}} <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> in recent years. Most professional practitioners in offshore jurisdictions refer to themselves as [...] "tax neutral" [...] since, whatever tax burdens the proposed transaction or structure will have in its primary operating market, having the structure based in an offshore jurisdiction will not create any additional tax burdens.|$|R
40|$|It is {{commonly}} {{assumed that the}} company law in <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres,</b> including the British Virgin Islands ('BVI'), is designed solely to provide flexibility for companies. You go offshore because you are jack of the 'nanny states' onshore. It is certainly true that <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> generally provide greater flexibility for companies and their directors {{in the manner in}} which they can conduct the company's affairs. But director worship is not what distinguishes offshore company law from onshore company law. <b>Offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> are not only taking steps to ensure they remain responsible jurisdictions with comprehensive anti-money laundering and terrorist financing initiatives, many are also moving to codify and expand the rights of minority shareholders. As will be highlighted in this article, the BVI has led the way in this regard, with a flexible companies statute that is robust in its protection of minority shareholders. ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, wealthy {{individuals}} started choosing to reside in low tax jurisdictions to reduce their taxable income. Gibraltar being such a jurisdiction attracted these wealthy individuals. In the 1930s refugees of extreme political regimes sought sanctuary for their goods and assets in Gibraltar. Asset holding and protection still continues in Gibraltar and usually involves trust companies with low taxation. Gibraltar functions as an <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centre.</b> Offshore companies in Gibraltar became popular during the blockade and provided business for lawyers and accountants. Gibraltar used to offer offshore companies a 25-year guarantee against income and estate taxes. This aspect of Gibraltar influenced nationality in that it allowed high-net-worth individuals to be granted residence on a discretionary basis.|$|E
2500|$|The British Virgin Islands law {{relating}} to trusts and equity is derived directly from English law, {{but has been}} modified by legislation to reflect {{the position of the}} territory as an <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centre.</b> [...] The usual features for offshore trusts are all empowered by statute in the territory - non-charitable purpose trusts, extended perpetuity periods, abrogation of the rule in Bartlett v Barclays Bank and widened investment powers.|$|E
2500|$|Investigatory laws - {{because of}} its {{position}} as an <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centre,</b> the British Virgin Islands has regulatory responsibilities which are out of all proportion with its size or economy. [...] The {{result has been a}} raft of legislation designed to investigate and curb unlawful tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing. [...] The unfortunate result of this is a patchwork quilt of rules of regulations that are extremely complex to follow, even for experienced practitioners and judges. [...] Some of the laws reflect bilateral agreements with specific countries, some relate to specific times of crime, and some have generic application. [...] Unfortunately a raft of conflicting international agreements, initiatives and treaties with conflicting standards and aims, any kind of rationalisation or consolidation seems wholly improbable.|$|E
50|$|Views of <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> {{tend to be}} polarised. Proponents {{suggest that}} reputable <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> play a {{legitimate}} and integral role in international finance and trade, and that their zero-tax structure allows financial planning and risk management and makes possible some of the cross-border vehicles necessary for global trade, including financing for aircraft and shipping or reinsurance of medical facilities. Proponents point to the tacit support of offshore centres by {{the governments of the}} United States (which promotes <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> by the continuing use of the Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC)) and United Kingdom (which actively promotes offshore finance in Caribbean dependent territories to help them diversify their economies and to facilitate the British Eurobond market). Opponents view them as draining tax revenues away from developed countries by allowing tax arbitrage, and rendering capital flows into and out of developing countries opaque. Very few commentators express neutral views.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{pressure}} groups suggest that <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> engage in [...] "unfair tax competition" [...] by having no, or very low tax burdens, and {{have argued that}} such jurisdictions {{should be forced to}} tax both economic activity and their own citizens at a higher level. Another criticism levelled against <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> is that while sophisticated jurisdictions usually have developed tax codes which prevent tax revenues leaking from the use of offshore jurisdictions, less developed nations, who can least afford to lose tax revenue, are unable {{to keep pace with the}} rapid development of the use of <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> structures.|$|R
5000|$|The FATF {{blacklist}} or OECD blacklist {{has been}} {{issued by the}} Financial Action Task Force since 2000 and lists countries which it judges to be non-cooperative in the global fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, calling them [...] "Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories" [...] (NCCTs). Although non-appearance on the blacklist was perceived to be a mark of approbation for <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> (or [...] "tax havens") who are sufficiently well regulated to meet all of the FATF's criteria, in practice the list included countries that did not operate as <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres.</b> The FATF updates the blacklist regularly, adding or deleting entries.|$|R
2500|$|Law in the British Virgin Islands {{tends to}} be a {{combination}} of the very old and the very new. [...] As a leading <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centre,</b> the territory has extremely modern statutes dealing with company law, insolvency, banking law, trust law, insurance and other related matters. [...] However, {{in a number of areas}} of law, such as family law, the laws of the British Virgin Islands are based upon very old English laws, and can cause some difficulty in modern times. [...] Other areas of law, such as international law, are essentially regulated externally through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London by Order in Council. [...] A large body of the laws of the British Virgin Islands consists of the common law, which continually updates itself through judicial precedent in the territory and in other common law countries.|$|E

40|$|The {{growth of}} Chinese {{multinational}} enterprises (MNE) has stimulated {{great interest in}} their {{outward foreign direct investment}} (FDI) strategies, particularly among academics in business and management studies. To date, however, serious methodological shortcomings plague empirical studies in these disciplines. Specifically, the vital issue of how Chinese MNEs use and route FDI via tax havens and <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> is not adequately dealt with. These practices have created large geographical, industrial composition and volume biases in Chinese outward FDI data. Using a sample of 100 Chinese MNEs, we illustrate how the use of tax havens and <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> has created these biases, and examine the implications for understanding Chinese MNE activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{future of}} <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> {{has been a}} major topic of legal and {{political}} debate in recent years. Whilst offshore centres around the globe have reaped substantial rewards in the past two decades, it is debateable whether this can and should be sustained. As one of the most prosperous <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres,</b> the study of Bermuda can be interpreted and applied to other <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> in the Caribbean. The analysis of international businesses and their employees is the central concept in this study in order to analyse the future of international business, and in particular the financial industry. A review of international expansion into foreign markets and the external factors associated with this will be analysed, followed by an analysis of ten interview subjects that have been chosen as representatives of the banking, insurance, and accounting industries on the island. The opinions of both expatriate and Bermudian citizens will be the main focus of my thesis {{due to the fact that}} the future of international business in Bermuda is highly dependent on skilled professionals remaining on the island. Their interpretation of the future is therefore the most important element...|$|R

5000|$|An <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centre</b> (OFC) is a small, low-tax {{jurisdiction}} {{specializing in}} providing corporate and commercial services to non-resident offshore companies, {{and for the}} investment of offshore funds. The term was coined in the 1980s. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) defines an <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centre</b> as [...] "a country or jurisdiction that provides financial services to nonresidents {{on a scale that}} is incommensurate with the size and the financing of its domestic economy." [...] Although information is still limited, there is strong evidence that OFCs captured a significant amount of global financial flows and functions both as back doors and partners of leading financial centre especially since the 1970s.|$|E
