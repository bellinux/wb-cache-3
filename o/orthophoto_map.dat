40|$|<b>Orthophoto</b> <b>maps</b> {{based on}} color-infrared aerial {{photography}} {{have been used}} by the Lithuanian forest inventory since 2001. This study aimed to investigate the opportunities for using these <b>orthophoto</b> <b>maps</b> to predict tree crown defoliation at the single tree and sample plot levels. The test area was located in the Aukstaitija National Park, eastern Lithuania, and it was photographed in the summer of 2008 using a Vexcel UltraCam D digital frame aerial camera to produce digital <b>orthophoto</b> <b>maps</b> with a 0. 5 x 0. 5 m ground sampling density. Some 1721 tree crowns (mainly pine, spruce and birch), located in 166 permanent sample plots, were identified and delineated on the <b>orthophoto</b> <b>maps.</b> Crown defoliation and other dendrometric characteristics were field-estimated for all of these trees in summer 2008. Judgments on the suitability of using color-infrared aerial photography based orthophotos to estimate tree crown defoliation were based on the accuracy of the defoliation prediction. Defoliation for each crown was predicted using the non-parametric k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) method and characteristics extracted from the digital <b>orthophoto</b> <b>maps</b> as the auxiliary variables for prediction. Prediction accuracies were validated using the “Leave One Out” technique by comparing the predicted data with data from field-assessed crown defoliations. The lowest root mean square errors for the predicted tree crown defoliation values were 7. 564 for pine trees, 9. 166 for spruce and 7. 712 for birch and the highest coefficients of correlation between field-estimated and predicted crown defoliations were 0. 576, 0. 600 and 0. 386, respectively. However, there was no best performing solution for using the k-NN prediction found, as the best results were achieved using different approaches. Next, predicted and field estimated tree crown defoliation values were aggregated up to the sample plot level by taking an averaging of trees in the same sample plot. The root mean square error at the sample plot level was around 3. 7 %, the bias was statistically not significant and the correlation coefficients between plot-wise average values of field-estimated and predicted defoliations were around 0. 8. The achieved results suggested that color-infrared <b>orthophoto</b> <b>maps</b> could be a potential data source of forest health characteristics for use in stand-wise forest inventories...|$|R

Control points were determined before the flight took place. The processing of nine stereopairs was carried out on an analytical plotter. Simultaneously with the on-line plotting of the contour lines the reference data for the computation of the profiles for the differential rectification were recorded.

40|$|Interferometry {{filtering}} {{is one of}} the key {{steps in}} obtain high-precision Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Digital <b>Orthophoto</b> <b>Map</b> (DOM). In the case of low-correlation or complicated topography, traditional phase filtering methods fail in balancing noise elimination and phase preservation, which leads to inaccurate interferometric phase. This paper proposed an adaptive iterated nonlocal interferometry filtering method to deal with the problem. Based on the thought of nonlocal filtering, the proposed method filters the image with utilization of the image redundancy information. The smoothing parameter of the method is adaptive to the interferometry, and automatic iteration, in which the window size is adjusted, is applied to improve the filtering precision.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2010. An <b>orthophoto</b> <b>map</b> is {{made from}} a {{combination}} of different geospatial datasets such as relief, imagery, powerlines and annotation. These data sets are usually generated by different divisions within national mapping agencies. Often, when an orthophoto mapping project is to be undertaken, other functions within and outside the system, are actuated. Examples of such functions include; photogrammetric scanning, digital elevation capturing, aerial triangulation, ancillary data and imagery acquisition and map compilation. This research is underpinned by the hypothesis that different components that supply data required for generating orthophoto maps do not work as a coherent whole. This behaviour impacts negatively on the production of orthophoto maps as well as the quality of the end product and can have spill over effects on service delivery. In this research, systems analysis, client satisfaction survey and SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis are used as a collective set of tools to analyze an orthophoto mapping system (OMS) in order to mitigate this unwanted behaviour. The case of <b>orthophoto</b> <b>map</b> production at the Chief Directorate of Surveys and Mapping (CDSM) in South Africa is used. First, systems analysis, which uses the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) technique, is employed to depict the system‘s data stores, processes and data flows. This approach helps to show how the current system works thereby assisting to pin point areas that require improvement. After presenting the system ‘s processes, data stores and data flows, a client satisfaction survey, built on the criteria of; accuracy, completeness, correctness and accessibility of geospatial datasets, is conducted on one of the data stores – the Topographical Information System (TIS) database. Finally, a SWOT analysis is then done on the whole OMS to evaluate the internal and external environment under which the current system operates in. Gaps are identified and recommendations suggested. Although in this case, the recommendations are built based on the CDSM case study, it is believed they can benefit other OMS’s in similar operating conditions elsewhere...|$|E
