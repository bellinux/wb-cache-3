25|$|In North America tokens were {{originally}} issued by merchants from the 18th century in regions where national or local colonial governments did not issue enough small denomination coins for circulation. They were later {{used to create}} a monopoly; to pay labor; for discounts (pay in advance, get something free or discounted); or for a multitude <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>reasons.</b> In the United States, a well-known type is the wooden nickel, a five-cent piece distributed by cities to raise money for their anniversaries in the 1940s to 1960s.|$|E
25|$|From the {{earliest}} days of white settlement in Australia, the concept of using nicknames for people and organisations was widely adopted. Many of {{the earliest}} footbal clubs to be formed quickly adopted a nickname; often based on the colour of the uniform, sometimes from the geographical location, or for a variety <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>reasons.</b> In earlier days, clubs often had more than one nickname, sometimes consecitively, but {{by the turn of the}} 20th century there was usually a greater stability with most clubs adopting one nickname by which they were known by both their own supporters and by the fans of opposing teams. By this time, many club followers were wearing badges, etc., which had a logo based on the nickname of their particular team.|$|E
25|$|In {{the secret}} Treaty of San Ildefonso of 1800, Spain agreed to return Louisiana to France; however, the {{boundaries}} were not explicitly specified. After France sold the Louisiana Purchase to the United States in 1803, another boundary dispute erupted. The United States laid {{claim to the}} territory from the Perdido River to the Mississippi River, which the Americans believed had {{been a part of}} the old province of Louisiana when the French had agreed to cede it to Spain in 1762. The Spanish insisted that they had administered that portion as the province of West Florida and that it was not part of the territory restored to France by Charles IV in 1802, as France had never given West Florida to Spain, among a list <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>reasons.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{signing of}} the Buenos Aires water and {{sanitation}} concession in 1992 attracted worldwide attention and {{was the source of}} considerable controversy for its scale of private participation in the Argentine water and sanitation sector. In addition to being one of the world's largest water concessions, the Buenos Aires concession has remained interesting for a number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>reasons.</b> First, the rapid implementation of the Buenos Aires concession contrasted with the slow movement towards private participation in other large urban water systems, such as Santiago or Lima. Second, the reform was widely acclaimed for generating major improvements in the water and sanitation sectors, including wider coverage, better service, more efficient operation of the company, and a reduction in waste. What makes these improvements especially striking is the immediate 26.9 percent reduction in water tariffs that followed the signing. Finally, the Buenos Aires case is of interest because the contract was renegotiated in 1997, provoking criticisms of the original bid and the regulation. More recently, the concession was revoked in 2006 and remained under arbitration in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Albanians {{produced}} many prominent {{figures such}} as Skanderbeg, leader of the medieval Albanian resistance to the Ottoman conquest, and others during the Albanian National Awakening seeking self-determination. During the 17th and 18th century, Albanians in large numbers converted to Islam, often to escape higher taxes levied on Christian subjects {{as well as a}} plethora <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>reasons</b> including ecclesiastical decay, coercion by Ottoman authorities in times of war and the privileged legal and social position of Muslims. As Muslims, some Albanians attained important political and military positions within the Ottoman Empire and culturally contributed to the wider Muslim world. Albania gained its independence in 1912, and from 1945 to 1992 Albanians lived under a communist government. Albanians within Yugoslavia underwent periods of discrimination and eventual self-determination that concluded with the breakup of that state in the early 1990s culminating with Albanians living in new countries and Kosovo. Outside the southwestern Balkans where Albanians have traditionally been located, Albanian populations through the course of history have formed new communities contributing to the cultural, economic, social and political life of their host populations and countries while also at times assimilating too.|$|E
25|$|The 1996 {{release of}} Byrd's diary of the May 9, 1926, flight {{revealed}} erased (but still legible) sextant sights that sharply differ with Byrd's later June 22 typewritten official {{report to the}} National Geographic Society. Byrd took a sextant reading of the Sun at 7:07:10 GCT. His erased diary record shows the apparent (observed) solar altitude to have been 19°25'30", while his later official typescript reports the same 7:07:10 apparent solar altitude to have been 18°18'18". On {{the basis of this}} and other data in the diary, Dennis Rawlins concluded that Byrd steered accurately, and flew about eighty percent of the distance to the Pole before turning back because of an engine oil leak, but later falsified his official report to support his claim of reaching the pole. Others disagree with Rawlins. In 1998, Colonel William Molett, an experienced navigator published Due north?; Molett maintained that Rawlins had put too much significance in erased navigational calculations which can be explained by any number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>reasons,</b> including favorable wind speeds as well as simple human error due to stress and lack of sleep. None of Molett's hypotheses explain how Byrd could have observed two completely different sextant altitudes in the same second of time.|$|E

25|$|In the Imboden District by contrast, it is {{only used}} habitually by 22%, and is the {{language}} of best command for only 9.9%. Even within this district however, the presence of Romansh varies, with 41.3% in Trin reporting to speak it habitually. In the Sutselva, the local Romansh dialects are extinct in most villages, with a few elder speakers remaining in places such as Präz, Scharans, Feldis/Veulden, and Scheid, though passive knowledge is slightly more common. Some municipalities still offer Romansh as a foreign language subject in school, though it is often under pressure of being replaced by Italian. The notably exception is Schams, where it is still regularly transmitted to children and where the language of instruction is Romansh. In the Surmeir region, it is still the dominant every day language in the Surses, but has mostly disappeared from the Albula Valley. The highest proportion of habitual speakers is found in Salouf with 86.3%, the lowest in Obervaz with 18.9%. In these areas, many Romansh speakers only speak German with their spouses as an accommodation or because of a habit, though they sometimes speak Romansh to their children. In most cases, this is not because of a will to preserve the language, but because <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>reasons</b> such as Romansh having been their own childhood language or a belief that their children will later find it easier to learn additional languages.|$|E
500|$|The last ship ever to {{pass through}} the canal and one of the last on the Kootenay was the North Star, also piloted by Captain Armstrong. In 1902, Armstrong decided to take North Star to sail on the Columbia instead, finding {{business}} on the Kootenay less and less profitable as the mines in the region played out, as the CPR established its Kootenay Central Railway branch, and for a variety <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>reasons.</b> In June of that year, Armstrong took North Star to the Baillie-Grohman Canal, which was in decrepit condition. The lock was also too small to accommodate the vessel. Armstrong had two makeshift dams built to create a temporary lock [...] long, and then the forward dam was blown up so the ship could ride the surge of water ahead into Columbia Lake. The transit of North Star to Columbia Lake was the last time the canal was ever used by a steamboat and marked the end of the steamboat era on the Kootenay.|$|E
500|$|Former {{executives}} at Sega have mixed {{opinions of the}} 32X. [...] Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves {{as a warning to}} the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. [...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>reasons.</b> In hindsight, it was not a great idea for a whole bunch of other reasons." ...|$|E

2500|$|Between 1815 and 1817 Beethoven's output dropped again.

Biographers have speculated on a variety <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>reasons</b> that also contributed to the decline, including the difficulties in the personal lives of his would-be paramours and the harsh censorship policies of the Austrian government.

On 13 August 1932, Hitler met with Hindenburg to ask be named Chancellor and was refused. Hindenburg told Hitler as recorded by his Chief of Staff Otto Meissner: [...] "The Reich;; President in reply said firmly that he must answer this demand with a clear, unyielding [...] "No".

2500|$|Critics have lambasted the United States for incarcerating a {{large number}} of non-violent and victimless offenders; half of all persons incarcerated under state {{jurisdiction}} are for non-violent offenses, and 20% are incarcerated for drug offenses (in state prisons; federal prison percentages are higher). [...] "Human Rights Watch believes the extraordinary rate of incarceration in the United States wreaks havoc on individuals, families and communities, and saps the strength of the nation as a whole." [...] The population of inmates housed in prisons and jails in the United States exceeds 2million, with the per capita incarceration population higher than that officially reported by any other country. Criminal justice policy in the United States has also been criticized for a number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>reasons.</b> In the 2014 book , journalist Matt Taibbi argues that the expanding disparity of wealth and the increasing criminalization of those in poverty have culminated in the U.S. having the largest prison population [...] "in the history of human civilization." [...] The scholars Michael Meranze and Marie Gottschalk contend that the massive [...] "carceral state" [...] extends far beyond prisons, and distorts democracy, degrades society, and obstructs meaningful discourse on criminal punishment.|$|E
