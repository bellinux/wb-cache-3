5|$|Dragonflies (suborder Anisoptera) are heavy-bodied, strong-flying {{insects that}} hold their wings {{horizontally}} both in flight and at rest. By contrast, damselflies (suborder Zygoptera) have slender bodies and fly more weakly; most species fold their wings over the abdomen when stationary, {{and the eyes}} are well separated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the head.|$|E
5|$|For {{the future}} {{setting of the}} film, a set {{featuring}} a hillside monastery was built. Myhre was inspired by Chinese temples built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> cliffs. The future set also featured a mixture of architectural styles from China, India, and Indonesia. Part of the set was a big wall, which {{was inspired by the}} Great Wall of China.|$|E

5|$|Mecoptera {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with long beaklike rostra, membranous wings and slender, elongated bodies. They have relatively simple mouthparts, {{with a long}} labium, long mandibles and fleshy palps, which resemble those of the more primitive true flies. Like many other insects, they possess compound eyes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> their heads, and three ocelli on the top. The antennae are filiform (thread-shaped) and contain multiple segments.|$|E
5|$|Refurbishment and {{improvement}} works completed in 2007 included new and reconstructed cross bridges between platforms and {{the installation of}} lifts for mobility impaired passengers. Cosmetic improvements carried {{out at the same}} time included the reinstatement of pole-mounted roundels <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the entrance vestibule. Other work in the 2000s at the station includes the construction of a substantial air rights building spanning across the cutting.|$|E

5|$|The ruff has a {{distinctive}} gravy boat appearance, {{with a small}} head, medium-length bill, longish neck and pot-bellied body. It has long legs that are variable in colour but usually yellow or orange. In flight, it has a deeper, slower wing stroke than other waders of a similar size, and displays a thin, indistinct white bar on the wing, and white ovals <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the tail.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a baggage {{compartment}} separating the driver's compartment from the crew compartment. Bench seats <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle, with under-seat storage, could accommodate six men. The windshield could fold forward {{and was also}} removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted at {{the upper part of}} the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected. Four side pieces could be mounted to protect the crew from the weather.|$|E
5|$|When {{it first}} emerges from its egg, the young red-throated loon {{is covered with}} fine soft down feathers. Primarily dark brown to dark grey above, it is {{slightly}} paler <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> its head and neck, {{as well as on}} its throat, chest, and flanks, with a pale grey lower breast and belly. Within weeks, this first down is replaced by a second, paler set of down feathers, which are in turn replaced by developing juvenile feathers. The juvenile's plumage {{is similar to that of}} the adult, though with a few distinguishing features. It has a darker forehead and neck, with heavy speckling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the neck and the throat. Its back is browner and less speckled, and its underparts are tinged with brown. Its eyes are reddish-brown, and its beak is a pale grey. Though some young birds hold this plumage until mid-winter, many quickly become virtually indistinguishable from adults, except for their paler bills.|$|E

50|$|Up {{until the}} {{introduction}} of repeating rifles and revolvers, weapons and tactics were definitely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Plains Indians, most especially the Comanche. However, disease and numbers were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Texans, and that increased with time.|$|R
50|$|This {{led to a}} {{conflict}} during the Thirty Years' War, between Louis V, who stood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emperor, and Maurice, who was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Protestants. Hesse-Darmstadt suffered severely from the ravages from the Swedes during the conflict.|$|R
5|$|With its {{flattened}} {{body and}} wing-like pectoral fins, the Pacific angelshark superficially resembles a ray. Unlike in rays, its five pairs of gill slits are located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the head rather than underneath, and the expanded anterior lobes of its pectoral fins are separate rather than fused to the head. The eyes {{are located on}} top of the head, with the spiracles behind. There are folds of skin without triangular lobes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> head. The mouth is very wide and placed terminally (at the front of the snout); a pair of cone-shaped barbels with spoon-like tips are located above. There are 9 tooth rows {{on either side of the}} upper jaw and 10 tooth rows on either side of the lower jaw, with toothless gaps at the middle of both jaws. Each tooth has a broad base and a single narrow, smooth-edged cusp.|$|E
5|$|After a {{company-wide}} {{contest to}} name the aircraft, the initial prototype received the name Pirate and made its first flight on 2 October 1946. Flight testing revealed severe aerodynamic problems, mostly caused by the airfoil section and thickness of the wing. The vertical stabilizer also had to be redesigned to smooth out the airflow {{at the intersection of}} the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. Other changes included the addition of dive brakes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the fuselage and the replacement of the Metalite panels near the engine's exhaust with stainless steel ones.|$|E
5|$|All {{described}} {{specimens of}} Sinosauropteryx preserve integumentary structures (filaments {{arising from the}} skin) which most palaeontologists interpret as very primitive type of feathers. These short, down-like filaments are preserved along the back half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and {{top and bottom of}} the tail. Additional patches of feathers have been identified <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the body, and palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on the back and the randomness of the patches elsewhere on the body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the ventral feathers having been removed by decomposition.|$|E

30|$|In conclusion, three {{measurements}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> impacted canines {{were significantly}} lower than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> without impaction; width from premolar to the mid-palatine raphe and lateral angulations of incisors (lateral and central) showed significant reduction, presenting disto-angulated incisors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> impacted canine.|$|R
5|$|In 1981, {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} revealed fine grooves or striations on the teeth in lemuriform toothcombs. These grooves were only found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the teeth on the concave surfaces between the sides, as well on the back ridge of the teeth. Between 10 and 20µm wide, these grooves indicate that hair moved repeatedly across the teeth. Inside these grooves were even finer grooves, less than 1µm, created by abrasion with the cuticular layer of the hair.|$|E
5|$|Living chelicerates {{have both}} {{compound}} eyes (only in horseshoe crabs, as the compound {{eye in the}} other clades {{has been reduced to}} a cluster of no more than five pairs of ocelli), mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the head, plus pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes"), mounted in the middle. These median ocelli-type eyes in chelicerates are assumed to be homologous with the crustacean nauplius eyes and the insect ocelli. The eyes of horseshoe crabs can detect movement but not form images. At the other extreme, jumping spiders have a very wide field of vision, and their main eyes are ten times as acute as those of dragonflies and is able to see in both colors and UV-light.|$|E
5|$|Most birds cannot {{move their}} eyes, {{although}} there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes {{on the front of}} their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.|$|E
40|$|When Cambarus clarkii {{is exposed}} to a source of light so that both eyes are equally illuminated, leg {{movements}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> are equal in frequency and amplitude. On covering one eye and exposing the uncovered eye to light, leg movements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uncovered eye are more frequent and are of greater amplitude than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> covered eye. <b>On</b> covering <b>the</b> exposed eye also <b>the</b> leg movements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> again tend to become equal in frequency and amplitude. When one eye is lost and the other remains functional, <b>the</b> leg movements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lost eye will be similar to those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a normal, covered eye...|$|R

5|$|Riley began sending poems to {{his brother}} again in February 1873. About {{the same time he}} and several friends began an {{advertisement}} company. The men traveled around Indiana creating large billboard-like signs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> buildings and barns and in high places that would be visible from a distance. The company was financially successful, but Riley was continually drawn to poetry. In October he traveled to South Bend where he took a job at Stockford & Blowney painting verses on signs for a month; the short duration of his job may have been due to his frequent drunkenness at that time.|$|E
5|$|Some on-street {{track was}} laid {{in a special}} {{foundation}} with cobbled road surfacing designed to be sympathetic with the style of Edinburgh streets but was removed in many places due to objections from cyclists. The trams are powered by overhead cables attached to purpose-built poles or mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> buildings. Nine electrical sub-stations were planned for the line to Newhaven, both underground and above-ground but only five were built after the line was truncated at York Place.|$|E
