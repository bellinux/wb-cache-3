40|$|Vehicle {{dynamics}} estimation {{has been}} the subject of study for some years now. If <b>on-board</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>control</b> systems can be provided with information such as side slip angle, lateral force etc. then stability of the vehicle can be improved. To estimate these dynamic variables different observers have been used e. g., sliding mode, fuzzy logic, neural networks etc. In this article the authors propose an extended Kalman lter to estimate vehicle side slip angle. Roll angle is estimated using vertical loads as input. First, a linear Kalman lter is used to lter out the vertical forces and estimate roll angle. This information is then used to estimate the vehicle side slip angle. To take into account the nonlinearities concerning lateral vehicle dynamics, Pacejka magic formula is used to model lateral forces. Estimated results are then compared with simulations, showing good accuracy...|$|E

The AHS is a large, complex system, in which vehicles are automatically controlled. The design and implementation of the AHS required advances in actuator and sensor technologies, as well as the design, analysis, simulation, and testing of large-scale, hierarchical, hybrid control systems.

40|$|AbstractVehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure {{communication}} (also {{known as}} V 2 X) can augment vehicle perception, {{which is a}} key factor in Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) {{as well as in the}} future scenario of Automated Driving. The European project AutoNet 2030 demonstrates how the combination of V 2 X and <b>on-board</b> sensors makes <b>vehicle</b> <b>control,</b> manoeuvring negotiations and interaction between vehicles more efficient and reliable. The target driving scenario involves a group of vehicles moving in a coordinated way, thanks to vehicle-to-vehicle communication. This requires a novel set of messages, to transmit vehicle status, trajectories and manoeuver intentions, such as lane change, within the group. Another research topic is the interaction between the on-board system and the driver (Human Machine Interaction, HMI), considering both the novel manoeuvre coordination concepts, and the gradual introduction of automated functions from an end user perspective.

40|$|This {{submission}} is {{a summary}} of the ten submissions that form the Engineering Doctorate Portfolio. The aim of the portfolio is to demonstrate the benefit of applying systems modelling and simulation in a modified powertrain product development process. A description is given of the competitive pressures that are faced by motor manufacturers in the global automotive business environment. Competitive pressures include a requirement for reduced time to market, exacting product quality standards, manufacturing over-capacity that increases fixed costs and compromises profit margins, and legislation that is increasingly difficult to meet. High-level strategic responses that are being made by manufacturers to these pressures are presented. Each strategic response requires organisational changes and improved approaches {{to the way in which}} day-to-day business is conducted. Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) is presented as an approach that can help to improve the competitiveness of motor manufacturers by reducing product development time and the level of hardware prototyping that is required. An investigation in five engineering companies yielded a number of observations about the use of CAE and its integration into product development. Best practice in the implementation of CAE in the product development process is defined. The use of CAE by a leading motor manufacturer in powertrain development is compared with the best practice model, and it is identified that there is a lack of coherence in the application of CAE. It is used to tackle specific problems but the use of CAE is not integrated into the product development process. More importantly, it was found that there is limited application of systems modelling and simulation, which is a critical technique for the effective integration of vehicle systems and the development of <b>on-board</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>control</b> systems. Before systems modelling and simulation can be applied III powertrain development, an appropriate set of tools and associated modelling architecture must be determined. An appraisal of a range of different tools is undertaken, each tool being appraised against a set of criteria. A combination of DymolaIModelica and MATLAB/Simulink tools is recommended as the optimum solution. DymolaIModelica models of the vehicle plant should be embedded into Simulink models that also contain controller and driver models. MATLAB should be used as the numerical engine and for the creation of user environments. Transmission calibration is selected as a suitable pilot example for applying systems modelling and simulation in powertrain development. Best practice in CAE implementation and the systems modelling and simulation architecture are validated using this example. Simulation models of vehicles equipped with CVT and discrete ratio automatic transmissions are presented. A full description of the operation of the transmission system, of the simulation model itself, and of the validation of the model is presented in each case. The potential benefit of the CVT model in transmission calibration is demonstrated. A Transmission Calibration Simulation Tool (TCST) is described within which the discrete ratio simulation model is encapsulated. The TCST includes a user environment in which the simulation model can be parameterised, a variety of simulation runs can be specified, and simulation results are processed. Development of the TCST requires an objective measure of driveability effects that are influenced by the transmission shift schedule. A method for objective assessment of driveability is developed, correlated, and implemented as an integral part of the TCST. This element of the TCST allows trade-off exercises to be conducted between fuel economy and driveability. The development of a transmission calibration based on experimental testing is compared with a similar exercise based on simulation testing. This study shows that, if the TCST is properly integrated into the transmission calibration process, the vehicle test time taken to optimise the calibration for fuel economy could be reduced by six weeks, and a week of calibrator time could be saved. Thus, the aim of the submission is fulfilled, since the benefit of applying systems modelling and simulation in the powertrain development process has been demonstrated. It is concluded that a consistent approach is required for effectively integrating systems modelling and simulation into the product development process. A model is proposed that clarifies how this can be achieved at a local level. It is proposed that in the future, the model is applied whenever systems modelling and simulation is introduced into a powertrain department...|$|E

The field of automotive engineering has seen {{an explosion in the}} presence of electronic components and systems <b>on-board</b> <b>vehicles</b> since the 1970 s.

In addition, the presence of micro-controllers <b>on-board</b> the <b>vehicle</b> led to a proliferation of functions implemented through electronic systems and related software, related to safety and customer convenience, creating the need for more sophisticated on-board diagnostics.
