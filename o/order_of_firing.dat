The two frigates grappled. The sudden and furious charge made by the Englishman, as he threw his masses of daring seamen along his bowsprit, and out of his channels, had nearly taken Griffith by surprise; but Manual, who had delivered his first fire with the broadside, now did good service, by ordering his men to beat back the intruders, by a steady and continued discharge. Even the wary Pilot lost sight of their other foes, in the high daring of that moment, and smiles of stern pleasure were exchanged between him and Griffith as both comprehended, at a glance, their advantages.|$|E

Out of these three models, CFGs (Chip-Firing Game) have received extensive attention on account of their application {{in many areas of}} mathematics such as algebra, combinatory, dynamical systems, statistics, algorithms, and computational complexity. In this paper, we use characterization properties of set of configurations called configuration space which are ordered by predecessor relations. We use CFG as a procedure called “Probability abacus ” to determine absorbing probability in the form of vector addition language. Furthermore, by using characterization property of ULD lattice we show that termination state of any CFG on absorbing Markova chain with rational transition matrix does not depend on <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> and at termination state critical loading re-occurred...|$|E
40|$|Most {{experimental}} and theoretical studies of brain function assume that neurons transmit information as a rate code, but recent {{studies on the}} speed of visual processing impose temporal constraints that appear incompatible with such a coding scheme. Other coding schemes that use the pattern of spikes across a population a neurons may be much more efficient. For example, since strongly activated neurons tend to fire first, one can use the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> as a code. We argue that Rank Order Coding is not only very efficient, but also easy to implement in biological hardware: neurons can be made sensitive {{to the order of}} activation of their inputs by including a feed-forward shunting inhibition mechanism that progressively desensitizes the neuronal population during a wave of afferent activity. In such a case, maximum activation will only be produced when the afferent inputs are activated in the order of their synaptic weights...|$|E

Although the most valuable knowledge is obtained through the design of long-term studies that address specific research questions in relation to fire and biota, these experiments take a long time to yield results and even longer to be transferred to practical applications. In contrast, retrospective studies that utilize historical data provide the opportunity to rapidly assess fire’s effects on ecosystems. To assess these effects, the first step is to obtain a basic understanding <b>of</b> historical <b>fire</b> patterns across the landscape.

40|$|Abstract — The {{introduction}} of axonal delays in networks of spiking neurons has enhanced the representational capabilities of neural networks, whilst also providing more biological realism. Approaches in neural coding such as rank order coding and polychronization have exploited the precise timing of action potential observed in real neurons. In a rank order code information is coded in the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> of {{a pool of}} neurons; {{on the other hand}} with polychronization it is the time of arrival of different spikes at the postsynaptic neuron which triggers different post-synaptic responses, with the axonal delays compensating for different timings in the afferents. In this paper we propose a model in which rank order coding is used to represent an arbitrary symbol, and a polychronous layer is used to decode, represent and recall that symbol. To prove that the polychronous layer is able to do this a detector neuron is trained with a supervised learning strategy and associated with a single code. According to this premise the detector neuron only fires on the appearance of the associated code, even in the presence of noise. Tests prove that rank order coding and polychronization can be coupled to code and decode information such as intensity or significance using timing information in spiking neural networks in an effective way...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. From {{physiology}} {{we learn}} that the auditory system extracts simultaneous features from the underlying signal, giving birth to simul-taneous representations of audible signals. We also learn that pattern analysis and recognition are not separated processes (in opposition to the engineering approach of pattern recognition where analysis and recogni-tion are usually separated processes). Furthermore, in the visual system, {{it has been observed}} that the sequence <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> is crucial to perform fast visual recognition tasks (Rank Order Coding). The use of the Rank Order Coding has also been recently hypothesized in the mammalian au-ditory system. In a first application we compare a very simplistic speech recognition prototype that uses the Rank Order Coding with a conven-tional Hidden Markov Model speech recognizer. It is also shown that the type of neurons being used should be adapted to the type of phonemes (consonants/transients or vowels/stable) to be recognized. In a second application, we combine a simultaneous auditory images representation with a network of oscillatory spiking neurons to segregate and bind auditory objects for acoustical source separation. It is shown that the spiking neural network performs unsupervised auditory images segmentation (to find ’auditory ’ objects) and binding of the objects be-longing to the same auditory source (yielding automatic sound source separation) ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the course}} of this project an {{electrical}} circuit was developed. The resulting VLSI chip encodes an array of analog inputs into a digital code. The chip performs analog-to-digital conversion, intensity normalization and rough classification. These properties could for example be useful for pre-processing in a speech recognition system. The chip's inputs in such a system could be the outputs of an analog bandpass filter array. The output code is based on the principle of rank order coding, capturing the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> across a neuron population. A neuron array and a temporal winner-take-all structure are used to produce the code. The implemented prototype has 31 analog inputs and 128 bits digital output. Theoretically, the chip would be able to classify 8. 22 * 10 ^{ 33 } (31 !) analog input patterns. Given that the input is a permutation of a specific intensity profile used in the testing, this information capacity is reduced to 3. 7 * 10 ^{ 12 } different input patterns, due to noise. This reduced information capacity gives {{reason to believe that the}} speech phonemes could be classified by this chip. However, this statement depends on an intensity profile that might not be realistic for any phoneme. This hypothesis has not been tried against a real speech input within this project...|$|E
40|$|Liquid State Machines {{have been}} {{proposed}} as a framework to explore the computational properties of neuro-electronic hybrid systems (Maass et al., 2002). Here the neuronal culture implements a recurrent network and is followed by an array of linear discriminants implemented using perceptrons in electronics/software. Thus in this framework, it is desired that the outputs of the neuronal network, corresponding to different inputs, be linearly separable. Previous studies have demonstrated this by either using only a small set of input stimulus patterns to the culture (Hafizovic etal., 2007), large number of input electrodes (Dockendorf et al., 2009) or by using complex schemes to post-process the outputs of the neuronal culture prior to linear discriminance (Ortman et al., 2011). In this study we explore ways to temporally encode inputs into stimulus patterns using a small set of electrodes such that the neuronal culture's output can be directly decoded by simple linear discriminants based on perceptrons. We demonstrate that network can detect the timing and <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> of inputs on multiple electrodes. Based on this, we demonstrate that the neuronal culture {{can be used as}} a kernel to transform inputs which are not linearly separable in a low dimensional space, into outputs in a high dimension where they are linearly separable. Thus simple linear discriminants can now be directly connected to outputs of the neuronal culture and allow for implementation of any function for such a hybrid system.

30|$|We derive Poincaré {{maps that}} relate the <b>firing</b> times <b>of</b> {{a network of}} two neurons coupled with {{reciprocal}} inhibition. We assume a predetermined one-to-one firing order between the neurons. The fixed points of these maps correspond to one-to-one firings of the neurons at the steady state. It is possible to derive similar maps assuming <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> that are not one-to-one, but these derivations are {{beyond the scope of}} the current study. We first assume a fixed synaptic strength between the neurons in Sect.  3.1. When the synapses have a fixed strength, only the phase response information of the neurons is used to determine the network activity, as has been shown previously [8]. In Sect.  3.2 we derive maps that describe the network activity when the synapses between the neurons are plastic. We compare two cases. In one case, we assume that the synapses obey the plasticity dynamics given in Eq. (2.3). In the second case, we consider synapses that obey the corresponding steady-state values given in Eq. (2.4). The latter case results in a lower-dimensional map. In Sect.  3.3, assuming both synapses obey a steady-state plasticity profile (2.6), we examine how changes in these profiles determine the network period and relative phase relations. We find conditions for a network {{to be able to keep}} a fixed firing period but vary the relative firing phase between its neurons, and vice versa.|$|R

40|$|The {{hippocampus}} is a brain structure {{critical for}} the formation of long-term episodic memories. The current predominant theory is that memories are gradually established across neocortical networks under the influence of hippocampal activity. This process of memory consolidation is conjectured to occur during sleep, which is characterized by two different modes of activation: slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The functional roles of these two different sleep states remain unknown. Paradoxically, REM sleep exhibits the main features of awake activity, and is the stage of sleep when most dreams occur. Despite decades of study, the organization and function of REM sleep activity remains poorly understood. The goal of this thesis is to achieve a deeper quantitative understanding of the patterns of firing in area CA 1 of the hippocampus during REM sleep using chronic multi-tetrode recordings from freely behaving and naturally sleeping rats. Our analysis shows that CA 1 neurons significantly elevate their firing rate for periods that are short in relation to the duration of the REM sleep episode. Furthermore, for the majority of neurons, there is exactly one such burst per REM episode. This leads to lower overall firing rates and sparser population activity in CA 1 compared to SWS. The time of onset of these bursts defines a natural <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> across the population of recorded neurons within each REM episode. We demonstrate that this order does not repeat across REM episodes. Our results suggest that CA 1 neurons are activated in random sequences across REM episodes, resulting in sparse patterns with {{only a small fraction of}} neurons active at any given time...|$|E
