5|$|When asked, many signers in the South gave anecdotal {{accounts}} <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> {{the signing}} of Black and White signers.

For quality control, one {{index for}} the quality of an HTS assay is the {{magnitude}} <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> a positive control and a negative reference in an assay plate. For hit selection, the size of effects of a compound (i.e., a small molecule or an siRNA) is represented by the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the compound and a negative reference. SSMD directly measures the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> two groups. Therefore, SSMD can be used for both quality control and hit selection in HTS experiments.|$|R

5|$|In the credits, the re-imagined {{series is}} said {{to be based on the}} 1976 novel by Terry Nation; however, there are a number <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the series and its source material. In the novel, Jenny Richards survives, whereas her {{counterpart}} in the 2008 series, Jenny Collins, does not; this means that Greg Preston and Jenny cannot have a child as the years unfold. Abby Grant still falls in love with Jimmy Garland; however, in the book, he eventually dies from septicaemia.|$|E
5|$|Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Matilda Joslyn Gage and Ida Husted Harper {{began in}} 1876 {{to write the}} History of Woman Suffrage. They planned for one volume but {{finished}} four before the death of Anthony in 1906, and two more afterward. The first three volumes chronicled {{the beginnings of the}} women's rights movement, including the years that Stone was active. Because <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> Stone and Stanton that had been highlighted in the schism between NWSA and AWSA, Stone's place in history was marginalized in the work. The text was used as the standard scholarly resource on 19th-century U.S. feminism for much of the 20th century, causing Stone's extensive contribution to be overlooked in many histories of women's causes.|$|E

25|$|According to {{contemporary}} scholars, these two manuscripts represent two different textual {{families of the}} Alexandrian text-type. The Codex Sinaiticus' John 1:1â€“8:38 represents another difference: the Western text-type. Additionally, chapters 16 and 21 in John include some Western readings, hence why the number <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> these two codices in John is greater than in the other Gospels.|$|E

25|$|The Vedanta {{schools of}} Hindu philosophy, that {{interpreted}} the Upanishads and the Brahma Sutra, provided the philosophical foundations of Vaishnavism. Given the ancient archaic {{language of the}} Vedic texts, each school's interpretation varied, {{and this has been}} the source <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the sampradayas (denominations) of Vaishnavism. These interpretations have created different traditions within Vaishnavism, from dualistic (Dvaita) Vedanta of Madhvacharya, to nondualistic (Advaita) Vedanta of Madhusudana Sarasvati.|$|E

25|$|Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener {{rejected}} Tischendorf's speculation because <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the two manuscripts. In Sinaiticus, {{the text}} of the Gospels is divided according to the Ammonian Sections with references to the Eusebian Canons, but Vaticanus used the older system of division. Vaticanus was prepared in a format of 5 folios in one quire, but Sinaiticus had 8 folios. According to Scrivener, Eusebian Bibles contained three or four folios per quire (Scrivener used a Latin version of Valesius). Scrivener stated that the Eusebian is unclear and should not be used for a doubtful theory.|$|E
25|$|There exists, however, {{some degree}} <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the Singaporean Chinese and {{mainland}} Chinese {{in terms of}} mindset, culture, and languages. While mainland Chinese are largely Sino-centric in their outlook of the world, Singaporean Chinese are educated in English medium schools (but also are taught the Chinese language) and are exposed to western influences due to its long history as a British constituent colony of the Straits Settlements. As such, the local Singaporean Chinese culture is a blend and mix of southern Chinese culture, local Singaporean culture (with various influences from cultures of other ethnicity) and western culture.|$|E

Under Young's leadership, producers would generally deed their property to the Order, and {{all members of the}} Order would share the cooperative's net income, often divided into shares based on the amount of property originally contributed. Sometimes, the members of the Order would receive wages for their work on the communal property.|$|E
25|$|A {{comprehensive}} list <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the American and British {{editions of}} the books is collected at the Harry Potter Lexicon web site. The changes are mostly simple lexical switches to reflect the different dialects and prevent American readers from stumbling over unfamiliar Briticisms. Changes of this sort are common when adapting any text from British to American editions {{but in the case}} of the Harry Potter books, this standard practice has occasionally drawn criticism from readers who feel that the British English adds flavour to the series. Rowling herself expressed regret after changing the first book's title, as the Philosopher's Stone is a legendary alchemical substance.|$|E

In his comments, Sir Michael Wright said that the two officers thought Menezes was about to detonate a 'device' on the Tube. He took the inquest jury through the events leading up to Menezes's death, listing a number of occasions where officers were unclear whether or not they thought they were pursuing a bomber. The jury was told <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> what was being relayed on radio and logged in the Scotland Yard control room and how the officers in the field were interpreting the information.|$|E
