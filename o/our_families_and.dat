2500|$|In January 2012, 22 South Korean women's' groups {{appealed for}} a nuclear free future, saying they believe nuclear weapons and power {{reactors}} [...] "threaten our lives, the lives of <b>our</b> <b>families</b> <b>and</b> all living creatures". The women said they feel an enormous sense of crisis after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011, which demonstrated the destructive power of radiation in the disruption of human lives, environmental pollution, and food contamination.|$|E

2500|$|For {{us to live}} in an oil-dependent {{society is}} to live in fear. [...] The fear of {{terrorism}} funded with the very dollars we spend at the gas pump.

2500|$|On March 8, 2003, International Women's Day, {{on the eve}} of the Iraq War, Walker {{was arrested}} with 26 others, {{including}} fellow authors Maxine Hong Kingston and Terry Tempest Williams, at a protest outside the White House, for crossing a police line during an anti-war rally. In an interview with Democracy Now, Walker said, [...] "I was with other women who believe that the women and children of Iraq are just as dear as the women and children in <b>our</b> <b>families,</b> <b>and</b> that, in fact, we are one family. And so it would have felt to me that we were going over to actually bomb ourselves." [...] Walker wrote about the experience in her essay [...] "We Are the Ones We Have Been Waiting For." ...|$|E

2500|$|By 8 January, vigils {{had spread}} to Australia, with {{thousands}} holding [...] "Je suis Charlie" [...] signs. In Sydney, people gathered at Martin Place– {{the location of a}} siege less than a month earlier– and in Hyde Park dressed in white clothing as a form of respect. [...] Flags were at half-mast at the city's French consulate where mourners left bouquets. A vigil was held at Federation Square in Melbourne with an emphasis on togetherness. French consul Patrick Kedemos described the gathering in Perth as [...] "a spontaneous, grass roots event". He added, [...] "We are far away but our hearts today [...] with <b>our</b> <b>families</b> <b>and</b> friends in France. It [...] an attack on the liberty of expression, journalists that were prominent in France, {{and at the same time}} it's an attack, or a perceived attack on our culture." ...|$|E

We have all stayed at home with our friends and <b>our</b> <b>families,</b> <b>and</b> we have had no special prosperity, but neither have we met with losses, and it grieves us to think that you, who were once as prosperous as any of us, should now feel--I should say experience--in any manner the pressure of privation." ...|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of the arrest, it was {{reported}} that Lawrence was recorded as saying: [...] "By dobbing some other **** I'm not killing my <b>family.</b> <b>And</b> what's the point anyway, because if we dob them in, right, we dob them in, they kill <b>our</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> then we're dead anyway.

[...] "It is the jackmen's {{masters of}} whom we complain, for playing at {{football}} with the honour of <b>our</b> <b>families,</b> <b>and</b> using as little ceremony with our daughters' sleeping chambers {{as if they}} were in a bordel at Paris. A party of reiving night walkers--courtiers and men of rank, as there is but too much reason to believe--attempted to scale the windows of Simon Glover's house last night; they stood in their defence with drawn weapons when they were interrupted by Henry Smith, and fought till they were driven off by the rising of the citizens." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{complaints}} made of Irish {{girls are}} numerous and loud; the failings of green Erin, alas! are but too open and manifest; yet, in arrest of judgment, let us move this consideration: let us imagine our own daughters {{between the ages}} of sixteen and twenty-four, untaught and inexperienced in domestic affairs as they commonly are, shipped to a foreign shore to seek service in families. It may be questioned whether as a whole they would do much better. The girls that fill <b>our</b> <b>families</b> <b>and</b> do our housework are often of the age of our own daughters, standing for themselves, without mothers to guide them, in a foreign country, not only bravely supporting themselves, but sending home in every ship remittances to impoverished friends left behind. If our daughters did as much for us, should we not be proud of their energy and heroism? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{have been}} continual fracases between the peasants and the military," [...] he said, [...] "over the {{attempts}} {{of the latter}} to arrest the priests. They can scarcely be called fights, for it has not come to that; {{but as soon as}} the peasants hear that the gendarmes are coming, they send the priest into the wood, and gather in such force that the gendarmes are glad enough to ride away, unharmed. Of course, until we see that the peasants are really in earnest, and intend to fight to the last, it would be madness for any of us to take any part in the matter; for we should be risking not only life but the fortunes of <b>our</b> <b>families,</b> <b>and</b> maybe their lives, too. You must remember, moreover, that already a great number of the landed proprietors have either been murdered or imprisoned in Paris, or are fugitives beyond the frontier." ...|$|E
6000|$|I ask you, what finer {{morality}} is preached to-day than was preached by Christ, by Buddha, by Socrates and Plato, by Confucius and whoever {{was the author}} of the [...] "Mahabharata"?

60|$|Josephine's {{eyes flashed}} round at me, {{and my heart}} shrunk within me as I {{thought that she was}} about to ask me that same dreadful question.

6000|$|... "Thank you, madame. I {{shall be}} {{very glad to}} do so.

60|$|Collins {{has done}} a melodrama (a regular old-style melodrama), {{in which there is}} a very good notion. I am going to act it, as an experiment, in the children's theatre here--I, Mark, Collins, Egg, and my {{daughter}} Mary, the whole dram. pers.; <b>our</b> <b>families</b> <b>and</b> yours the whole audience; for I want to make the stage large and shouldn't have room for above five-and-twenty spectators. Now there is only one scene in the piece, and that, my tarry lad, is the inside of a lighthouse. Will you come and paint it for us one night, and we'll all turn to and help? It is a mere wall, of course, but Mark and I have sworn that you must do it. If you will say yes, I should like to have the tiny flats made, after you have looked at the place, and not before. On Wednesday in this week I am good for a steak and the play, if you will make your own appointment here; or any day next week except Thursday. Write me a line in reply. We mean to burst on an astonished world with the melodrama, without any note of preparation. So don't say a syllable to Forster if you should happen to see him.|$|E
60|$|All {{one can say}} is, roughly, {{that the}} homelier the home, and the more {{familiar}} the family, the worse for everybody concerned. The family ideal is a humbug and a nuisance: one might as reasonably talk of the barrack ideal, or the forecastle ideal, or any other substitution of the machinery of social organization {{for the end of}} it, which must always be the fullest and most capable life: in short, the most godly life. And this significant word reminds us that though the popular conception of heaven includes a Holy Family, it does not attach to that family the notion of a separate home, or a private nursery or kitchen or mother-in-law, or anything that constitutes the family as we know it. Even blood relationship is miraculously abstracted from it; and the Father is the father of all children, the mother the mother of all mothers and babies, and the Son the Son of Man and the Savior of his brothers: one whose chief utterance {{on the subject of the}} conventional family was an invitation to all of us to leave <b>our</b> <b>families</b> <b>and</b> follow him, and to leave the dead to bury the dead, and not debauch ourselves at that gloomy festival the family funeral, with its sequel of hideous mourning and grief which is either affected or morbid.|$|E
60|$|Then he went away, {{leaving us}} very much troubled, and {{wondering}} what he could mean. In about an hour we found out; for by {{that time it was}} all over the village that Father Peter had been arrested for stealing a great sum of money from the astrologer. Everybody's tongue was loose and going. Many said it was not in Father Peter's character and must be a mistake; but the others shook their heads and said misery and want could drive a suffering man to almost anything. About one detail there were no differences; all agreed that Father Peter's account of how the money came into his hands was just about unbelievable--it had such an impossible look. They said it might have come into the astrologer's hands in some such way, but into Father Peter's, never! Our characters began to suffer now. We were Father Peter's only witnesses; how much did he probably pay us to back up his fantastic tale? People talked that kind of talk to us pretty freely and frankly, and were full of scoffings when we begged them to believe really we had told only the truth. Our parents were harder on us than any one else. Our fathers said we were disgracing <b>our</b> <b>families,</b> <b>and</b> they commanded us to purge ourselves of our lie, and there was no limit to their anger when we continued to say we had spoken true. Our mothers cried over us and begged us to give back our bribe and get back our honest names and save our families from shame, and come out and honorably confess. And at last we were so worried and harassed that we tried to tell the whole thing, Satan and all--but no, it wouldn't come out. We were hoping and longing all the time that Satan would come and help us out of our trouble, {{but there was no sign}} of him.|$|E
5000|$|Carolyn Marksberry <b>and</b> her <b>family</b> {{issued a}} {{statement}} that was read to reporters after the execution.
