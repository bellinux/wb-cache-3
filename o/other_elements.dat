5|$|Modern steels {{are made}} with varying {{combinations}} of alloy metals to fulfill many purposes. Carbon steel, composed simply of iron and carbon, accounts for 90% of steel production. Low alloy steel is alloyed with <b>other</b> <b>elements,</b> usually molybdenum, manganese, chromium, or nickel, in amounts of up to 10% by weight to improve the hardenability of thick sections. High strength low alloy steel has small additions (usually < 2% by weight) of <b>other</b> <b>elements,</b> typically 1.5% manganese, to provide additional strength for a modest price increase.|$|E

5|$|The Last of Us {{features}} an original score, composed by musician Gustavo Santaolalla. Known for his minimalist approach to composing, Santaolalla was contacted early in development. Naughty Dog took a similar minimalist approach to <b>other</b> <b>elements</b> of the game, including the action, sound design and art design. The sound department began working {{early on the}} sound of the Infected, in order to achieve the best work possible. A similar direction was taken by the art department, whose designs influenced <b>other</b> <b>elements</b> of development. Naughty Dog overhauled their game engine for some elements, particularly lighting and animations.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the lighter}} elements, fluorine's {{abundance}} value of 400ppb (parts per billion) – 24th among {{elements in the}} universe – is exceptional: <b>other</b> <b>elements</b> from carbon to magnesium are twenty or more times as common. This is because stellar nucleosynthesis processes bypass fluorine, and any fluorine atoms otherwise created have high nuclear cross sections, allowing further fusion with hydrogen or helium to generate oxygen or neon respectively.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, {{especially}} in order theory, a maximal {{element of a}} subset S of some partially ordered set (poset) {{is an element of}} S that is not smaller than any <b>other</b> <b>element</b> in S.

5|$|As with <b>other</b> <b>elements,</b> the {{simplest}} compounds of copper are binary compounds, i.e. those containing only two elements, the principal examples being oxides, sulfides, and halides. Both cuprous and cupric oxides are known. Among the numerous copper sulfides, important examples include copper(I) sulfide and copper(II) sulfide.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the stars}} lies the {{interstellar}} medium, {{a region of}} sparse matter.

5|$|Fluorine is a {{chemical}} element with symbol F and atomic number 9. It is the lightest halogen and exists {{as a highly}} toxic pale yellow diatomic gas at standard conditions.
