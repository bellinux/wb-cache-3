50|$|Net: 2O3 -> 3O2 What occurs is {{chlorine}} (Cl2) combines with ozone (O3) {{after exposure}} to light {{to form a}} hypochlorite (ClO) molecule and diatomic oxygen (O2). This results in affecting the oxygen available to breathe in. The hypochlorite (ClO) then combines with another hypochlorite {{in the presence of}} a third body (M), which is just a solid surface that allows the reaction to take place. The reason this reaction is so harmful to ozone is the chlorine is able to be recycled and be eligible to destroy another ozone molecule again in a continuous cycle. On average, over five to ten molecules of ozone are consumed by every chlorine atom deposited in a rocket’s plume originating from the rocket fuel. Chlorine was confirmed to be the greatest contributor to ozone loss resulting from rocket plumes due to data collected in night rocket launches. This is due to the need of sunlight to activate the chlorine in order to initiate the destruction of <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle</b> by chlorine molecules.|$|E

The simulated <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle</b> shows a minimum after sunrise and a maximum in the late afternoon.

Depending on season and latitude, the peak-to-valley difference of the daily <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle</b> varies mostly between 3 – 5 % (0. 4 ppmv) with respect to the midnight ozone volume mixing ratio. The maximal variation of 15 % (0. 8 ppmv) is found at the polar circle in summer. The global pattern of the strength of the daily <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle</b> is mainly governed by the solar zenith angle and the sunshine duration. In addition, we find synoptic scale variations in the strength of the daily <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle.</b> These variations are often anti-correlated to regional temperature anomalies and are due to the temperature dependence of the rate coefficients k 2 and k 3 of the Chapman cycle reactions. Further, the NO x catalytic cycle counteracts to the accumulation of ozone during daytime and leads to an anti-correlation between anomalies in NO x and the strength of the daily <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle.</b> Similarly, ozone recombines with atomic oxygen which leads to an anti-correlation between anomalies in ozone abundance and the strength of the daily <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle.</b> At higher latitudes, an increase of the westerly (easterly) wind cause a decrease (increase) in the sunshine duration of an air parcel leading to a weaker (stronger) daily <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle...</b>|$|E

Results show that the vertical structure of the tropical <b>ozone</b> solar <b>cycle</b> response has been consistently characterized by statistically significant positive responses in {{the upper and lower}} stratosphere and by statistically insignificant responses in the middle stratosphere (∼ 28 – 38 km altitude). This vertical structure differs from that predicted by most models. The similar vertical structure in the tropics obtained for separate time intervals (with minimum response invariably near 10 hPa) is difficult to explain by random interference from the QBO and volcanic eruptions in the statistical analysis. The observed increase in tropical total column <b>ozone</b> approaching the <b>cycle</b> 23 maximum during the late 1990 s occurred primarily in the lower stratosphere below the 30 hPa level. A mainly dynamical origin for the solar <b>cycle</b> total <b>ozone</b> variation at low latitudes is therefore likely.

Here, we derive a monthly climatology of the daily <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle</b> from 17 years of GROMOS observation. We present the diurnal ozone variation of the stratosphere and mesosphere. Characterizing the diurnal cycle of stratospheric ozone is important for correct trend estimates {{of the ozone layer}} derived from satellite observations. The diurnal <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle</b> from GROMOS is compared to two models: the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) and the Hamburg Model of Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere (HAMMONIA).

In the stratosphere, ozone reaches its maximum in the afternoon showing values several percent larger than the midnight value. Further, GROMOS and models indicate a seasonal behaviour of the diurnal ozone variations in the stratosphere with a larger afternoon maximum during daytime in summer than in winter. Using the 17 years of ozone profiles from GROMOS, we find strong interannual variations in the diurnal <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle</b> for both the stratosphere and the mesosphere.

40|$|A {{photochemical}} box {{model has}} been used to model the measured diurnal <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle</b> in spring at Jungfraujoch in the Swiss Alps. The comparison of the modelled diurnal <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle</b> with the mean measured diurnal <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle</b> in spring, over the period 1988 - 1996, shows a good agreement both with regard to the shape and amplitude. Ozone concentrations increase during the daytime and reach a maximum at about 16 : 00 - 17 : 00 (GMT) in both the modelled and the mean observed <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle,</b> indicative of net ozone production during the daytime at Jungfraujoch in spring. The agreement is better when the modelled <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle</b> is compared with the mean measured diurnal cycle (1988 - 1996) filtered for north-westerly winds > 5 m/s (representative of regional background conditions at Jungfraujoch). In addition to ozone, the modelled diurnal cycle of [HO 2] + [CH 3 O 2] also shows rather good agreement with the mean diurnal cycle of the peroxy radicals measured during FREETEX ' 96, a FREE Tropopsheric Experiment at Jungfraujoch in April/May 1996. Furthermore, this mean diurnal cycle of the sum of the peroxy radicals measured during FREETEX ' 96 is used to calculate, using steady-state expressions, the respective diurnal cycle of the OH radical. The comparison of the OH diurnal cycle, calculated from the peroxy radical measurements during FREETEX ' 96, with the modelled one, reveals also good agreement. The net ozone production rate during the day-time is 0. 27 ppbv h- 1 from the model, and 0. 13 ppbv h- 1 from the observations during FREETEX ' 96. The observations and model results both suggest that the diurnal ozone variation in spring at Jungfraujoch is primarily of photochemical origin. Furthermore, the observed and modelled positive net ozone production rates imply that tropospheric in situ photochemistry contributes significantly to the observed high spring ozone values in the observed broad spring-summer ozone maximum at Jungfraujoch...|$|E

The instruments GROMOS-C and OZORAM have been located at the AWIPEV research base at Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard (79 ° N, 12 ° E) and gathered a comprehensive time series of middle atmospheric ozone profiles with a high time resolution. An intercomparison was performed with EOS MLS and ozone sonde measurements and simulations with SD-WACCM. The measured datasets were used to study the photochemically induced diurnal cycle of ozone in the stratosphere and mesosphere. Throughout the year the insolation in the Arctic changes drastically from polar night to polar day. Accordingly, the seasonal variations in the diurnal <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle</b> are large. In the stratosphere we found a diurnal cycle throughout the whole period of polar day with the largest amplitude in April. In the mesosphere a diurnal cycle was detected in spring and fall.

A representative example is the investigation of catalytic <b>ozone</b> destruction <b>cycles</b> in the stratosphere.

Under the assumption that reaction rates are known, it finds all significant pathways, i. e. all pathways with a rate above a prescribed threshold. The algorithm forms pathways step by step, starting from single reactions. The chemical species in the system are consecutively considered as `branching points'. For every branching-point species, each pathway producing it is connected with each pathway consuming it. Rates proportional to `branching probabilities' are calculated. Pathways with a rate that is smaller than a prescribed threshold are discarded. If a newly formed pathway contains sub-pathways, e. g. null cycles, it is split into these simpler pathways.

40|$|Recently, it {{was shown}} that of the ozone-depleting {{substances}} currently emitted, N 2 O emissions (the primary source of stratospheric NOx) dominate, {{and are likely to}} do so throughout the 21 st century. To investigate the links between N 2 O and NOx concentrations, and the effects of NOx on ozone in a changing climate, the evolution of stratospheric ozone from 1960 to 2100 was simulated using the NIWA-SOCOL chemistry-climate model. The yield of NOx from N 2 O is reduced due to stratospheric cooling and a strengthening of the Brewer-Dobson circulation. After accounting for the reduced NOx yield, additional weakening of the primary NOx cycle is attributed to reduced availability of atomic oxygen, due to a) stratospheric cooling decreasing the atomic oxygen/ozone ratio, and b) enhanced rates of chlorine-catalyzed <b>ozone</b> loss <b>cycles</b> around 2000 and enhanced rates of HOx-induced ozone depletion. Our results suggest that the effects of N 2 O on ozone depend on both the radiative and chemical environment of the upper stratosphere, specifically CO 2 -induced cooling of the stratosphere and elevated CH 4 emissions which enhance HOx-induced ozone loss and remove the availability of atomic oxygen to participate in NOx <b>ozone</b> loss <b>cycles...</b>|$|R

Generally, observation and models show good qualitative agreement: in the lower mesosphere, daytime ozone is for both GROMOS and models around 25 % less than nighttime ozone (reference is 22 : 30 – 01 : 30). In the stratosphere, ozone reaches its maximum in the afternoon showing values several percent larger than the midnight value. It is important that diurnal ozone variations of this order are taken into account when merging different data sets for the derivation of long-term ozone trends in the stratosphere.

At 0. 35 hPa, observations from GROMOS and Aura/MLS show a seasonal pattern in diurnal ozone variations with larger relative amplitudes during daytime in winter (− 25 ± 5 %) than in summer (− 18 ± 4 %) (compared to mean values around midnight). For the first time, a time series of the diurnal variations in ozone is presented: 17 yr of GROMOS data show strong interannual variations in the diurnal <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle</b> for both the stratosphere and the mesosphere.

Although significant biases exist between {{the two types of}} observations, the long-term variations and least squares linear regression trends agree remarkably well over the comparison period of 1979 to 1990. The ozone trend in the upper stratosphere is of the order of - 0. 9 %/yr. Near 25 km, little if any trend appears, but a larger negative trend is seen in the lower stratosphere near 15 km. Comparisons show that the average annual <b>ozone</b> <b>cycles</b> in the profiles also agree well. The upper stratospheric ozone results are consistent with photochemical model predictions of ozone depletion near 40 km that are due to the release of anthropogenically produced chlorofluorocarbons.

It is shown that the ozone trends in the lower stratospheric layers impact significantly on the total ozone trend of the order of - 0. 47 %/yr.

The April ozone maximum has been well documented and appears at the time when the stratospheric ozone content is greatest and cyclogenetic activity is most vigorous. However, the secondary maximum in June has not been widely observed or quoted as a unique feature.

We replace straight-line back-trajectories with trajectories and associated meteorology supplied by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) service to allow more realistic modelling of specific UK ozone episodes. We call this ELMO- 2. Model performance is rigorously tested against observed ozone concentrations for two episodes recorded across 14 rural UK monitoring stations during {{the spring and summer}} of 1995. For both episodes, the afternoon concentrations (usually coinciding with the daily maxima) are captured well by the model and the diurnal <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle</b> is reproduced, although the amplitude in concentrations is generally smaller than the observed. The summer episode is investigated further through indicator species analysis and source attribution, and found to be mainly VOC-limited. European emissions account for the majority of ozone production. We demonstrate how improved modelling leads to better understanding of regional and local ozone production across the UK under episodic conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe have assimilated for {{the first}} time SPICAM retrievals of total ozone into a Martian global {{circulation}} model to provide a global reanalysis of the <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle.</b> Disagreement in total ozone between model prediction and assimilation is observed between 45 °S– 10 °S from L S = 135 – 180 ° and at northern polar (60 °N– 90 °N) latitudes during northern fall (L S = 150 – 195 °). Large percentage differences in total ozone at northern fall polar latitudes identified through the assimilation process are linked with excessive northward transport of water vapour west of Tharsis and over Arabia Terra. Modelling biases in water vapour can also explain the underestimation of total ozone between 45 °S– 10 °S from L S = 135 – 180 °. Heterogeneous uptake of odd hydrogen radicals are unable to explain the outstanding underestimation of northern polar total ozone in late northern fall. Assimilation of total ozone retrievals results in alterations of the modelled spatial distribution of ozone in the southern polar winter high altitude ozone layer. This illustrates the potential use of assimilation methods in constraining total ozone where SPICAM cannot observe, in a region where total ozone is especially important for potential investigations of the polar dynamics...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between near-surface ozone concentration {{and the structure}} of the nocturnal boundary layer was investigated during a field campaign conducted in 1998 in the Lower Fraser Valley (LFV), British Columbia Canada. Despite the spatial and temporal variation in frequency and morphology, secondary nocturnal ozone maxima were shown to be an important feature of the diurnal <b>ozone</b> <b>cycle</b> throughout the LFV, and localised increases in ozone occasionally exceeded more than half the previous day’s maximum concentration. Turbulence in the nocturnal boundary layer was shown to be weak and intermittent. Vertical profiles of Richardson number and ozone concentration indicated that the temporary turbulent coupling of the residual layer to the surface layer facilitated the transport of ozone stored aloft to the surface. Despite the overall complexity of the system, results show that seven out of the 19 ozone spikes observed at the Aldergrove site coincided with turbulence associated with the development of the down-valley wind system. A further nine spikes occurred during periods when a low-level jet was identified aloft. Significantly, ozone concentrations were shown to be highly variable in the residual layer and {{played an important role in}} determining the morphology of secondary ozone maxima at the surface. Largest increases in surface ozone concentration occurred when turbulence coincided with periods when ozone concentrations in excess of 80 ppb were observed aloft...|$|E
40|$|Utilizing in-situ {{measurements}} of ClO {{made in the}} same airmass more than once under different photochemical conditions during the Geophysica self-match flight during Euplex 2003, enabled us to examine {{our understanding of the}} kinetics of chlorine dimer cycle in detail. The kinetics of the chlorine dimer catalytic <b>ozone</b> loss <b>cycle</b> rely upon the thermal equilibrium between the monomer ClO and the dimer ClOOCl and the photolysis rate of the dimer ClOOCl. In this paper, we illustrate the kinetic constraints able to be determined by such a methodology. Our results suggest a thermal equilibrium constant a factor of 5 smaller and a ratio of photolysis rate to formation rate of ClOOCl a factor of 2 larger than the values based on the JPL recommendations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In situ {{atmospheric}} ozone measurements aboard the R/V Ronald H. Brown during the 2008 Gas-Ex and AMMA research cruises {{were compared with}} data from four island and coastal Global Atmospheric Watch stations in the Atlantic Ocean to examine ozone transport in the marine boundary layer (MBL). Ozone measurements made at Tudor Hill, Bermuda, were subjected to continental outflow from {{the east coast of}} the United States, which resulted in elevated ozone levels above 50 ppbv. Ozone measurements at Cape Verde, Republic of Cape Verde, approached 40 ppbv in springtime and were influenced by outflow from Northern Africa. At Ragged Point, Barbados, ozone levels were ∼ 21 ppbv; back trajectories showed the source region to be the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Ozone measurements from Ushuaia, Argentina, indicated influence from the nearby city; however, the comparison of the daily maxima ozone mole fractions measured at Ushuaia and aboard the Gas-Ex cruise revealed that these were representative of background ozone in higher latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. Diurnal <b>ozone</b> <b>cycles</b> in the shipborne data, frequently reaching 6 – 7 ppbv, were larger than most previous reports from coastal or island monitoring locations and simulations based on HOx photochemistry alone. However, these data show better agreement with recent ozone modeling that included ozone-halogen chemistry. The transport time between station and ship was estimated from HYSPLIT back trajectories, and the change of ozone mole fractions during transport in the MBL was estimated. Three comparisons showed declining ozone levels; in the subtropical and tropical North Atlantic Ocean the loss of ozone was < 1. 5 ppbv day− 1. Back trajectories at Ushuaia were too inconsistent to allow for this determination. Comparisons between ship and station measurements showed that ozone behavior and large-scale (∼ 1000 km) multi-day transport features were well retained during transport in the MBL...|$|R
40|$|Ozone is an {{important}} pollutant and greenhouse gas, and tropospheric ozone variations are generally associated with both natural and anthropogenic processes. As {{one of the most}} pristine and inaccessible regions in the world, the Tibetan Plateau has been considered as an ideal region for studying processes of the background atmosphere. Due to the vast area of the Tibetan Plateau, sites in the southern, northern and central regions exhibit different patterns of variation in surface ozone. Here, we present continuous measurements of surface ozone mixing ratios at Nam Co Station over a period of [*]∼  5  years (January 2011 to October 2015), which is a background site in the inland Tibetan Plateau. An average surface ozone mixing ratio of 47. 6  ±  11. 6  ppb (mean ± standard deviation) was recorded, and a large annual cycle was observed with maximum ozone mixing ratios in the spring and minimum ratios during the winter. The diurnal cycle is characterized by a minimum in the early morning and a maximum in the late afternoon. Nam Co Station represents a background region where surface ozone receives negligible local anthropogenic emissions inputs, and the anthropogenic contribution from South Asia in spring and China in summer may affect Nam Co Station occasionally. Surface ozone at Nam Co Station is mainly dominated by natural processes involving photochemical reactions, vertical mixing and downward transport of stratospheric air mass. Model results indicate that the study site is affected differently by the surrounding areas in different seasons: air masses from the southern Tibetan Plateau contribute to the high ozone levels in the spring, and enhanced ozone levels in the summer are associated with air masses from the northern Tibetan Plateau. By comparing measurements at Nam Co Station with those from other sites on the Tibetan Plateau, we aim to expand the understanding of <b>ozone</b> <b>cycles</b> and transport processes over the Tibetan Plateau. This work may provide a reference for future model simulations...|$|R
