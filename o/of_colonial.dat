5|$|A key {{strategy}} was the establishment <b>of</b> <b>colonial</b> towns across the territories that underwent {{the process of}} conquest and colonisation; {{they were used to}} project Spanish power over the surrounding countryside. The Spanish were particularly horrified by the Mesoamerican religious practice of human sacrifice, prompting them to attempt to eradicate the native religion.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane, by now a Vice Admiral, assumed his {{position}} as Commander-in-Chief of British forces on the North Atlantic station in April 1814 and ordered the recruitment of a body <b>of</b> <b>Colonial</b> Marines {{as he had done}} six years earlier on Marie Galante. Rear Admiral George Cockburn, Cochrane's second-in-command on the Atlantic coast, implemented Cochrane's order recruiting the second Corps <b>of</b> <b>Colonial</b> Marines. It served as part of the British forces on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States during the War of 1812.|$|E

5|$|His {{influence}} can {{as well be}} seen in Ecuadorian {{thought in}} general, as his work {{has been one of}} its principal influences; Ecuadorian education, as he promoted new pedagogical ideas, such as the creation of good citizens instead of merely imparting knowledge, and finally Ecuadorian science, as he was, along with Pedro Vicente Maldonado, one of the two most important scientists <b>of</b> <b>colonial</b> Ecuador. Espejo analyzed the reality <b>of</b> <b>colonial</b> Quito, the poverty of its people and their lack of good education, and he denounced the corruption of the colonial authorities.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Livestock Conservancy began {{investigating}} the Carolina Marsh Tacky {{to see if}} it was truly a descendant <b>of</b> <b>colonial</b> Spanish stock, and during the organization's initial field investigations it was found that many surviving members of the breed fit the physical type for Spanish horses. In 2007, the organization partnered with the Equus Survival Trust in a project to preserve the breed that included DNA sampling, the creation of a new studbook and mapping the genetics of the breed. The Conservancy participated in the rescue of the Wilbur Cruce strain <b>of</b> <b>Colonial</b> Spanish horse when the area in which it lived was to be turned over to a land conservation program that required domestic animals to be removed. After the rescue, a conservation plan was developed for the animals and small breeding groups of horses were placed with responsible parties. It also assisted in formulating a conservation and breeding strategy for a strain <b>of</b> <b>Colonial</b> Spanish horses from Santa Cruz Island in California. This support helped the horses to become recognized and registrable with the Colonial Spanish registry.|$|E
5|$|Like much of {{the rest}} of French West Africa, the colony had a number of {{policies}} regarding Islam and the Muslim communities.

40|$|As {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} argued, war, {{as a social}} and political phenomenon, strikes at least three generations: the generation that is call, the parent´s generation and the generation {{of the children of}} the war.

5|$|Although {{the living}} {{conditions}} for black soldiers gradually improved, {{they were still}} kept in considerably worse ones {{than those of the}} white French soldiers, and the mortality rate among black soldiers was also considerably higher. Around 10,000 North African prisoners were released in 1941. Escapes and repatriations reduced the number <b>of</b> <b>colonial</b> prisoners of war to 30,000 by July 1944.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the fall of Nojpetén, there are {{estimated}} to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Petén Itzá, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years <b>of</b> <b>colonial</b> rule owing to a combination of disease and war. Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between indigenous groups also played their part.|$|E
5|$|Clemuel Ricketts, the {{architect}} of the stone house, was very interested in architecture from the colonial period and had traveled widely. In the 1840s he published a book which examined the British and European sources <b>of</b> <b>colonial</b> architecture in the United States. Clemuel designed the house in the colonial or Georgian style in the early 1850s; construction began in either 1851 or 1854 and finished the next year.|$|E
50|$|After the First World War, France's African war aims {{were not}} being decided by her cabinet or the {{official}} mind <b>of</b> the <b>colonial</b> ministry, but rather the leaders <b>of</b> the <b>colonial</b> movement in French Africa. The first occasion of this was in 1915-1916, when Francois Georges-Picot (both a diplomat and part <b>of</b> a <b>colonial</b> dynasty) met with the British to discuss the division of Cameroon. Picot proceeded with negotiations with neither the oversight of the French president nor the cabinet. What resulted was Britain giving nine tenths of Cameroon to the French. Picot emphasized {{the demands of the}} French colonists over the French cabinet. This policy <b>of</b> French <b>colonial</b> leaders determining France's African war aims can be seen throughout much of France's empire.|$|R
5000|$|A. R. Disney further {{states that}} by the time of Dom Jerónimo de Azevedo's mandate as viceroy the {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>colonials</b> in Goa, as distinct from metropolitan Portuguese, was steadily growing. These colonials had interests and an outlook that did not necessarily coincide with those of the metropolis. In practice, Dom Jerónimo de Azevedo - who had come to Asia as a young man and served for his entire career in the Portuguese [...] "Estado da Índia" [...] - was a <b>colonial.</b> This influence <b>of</b> <b>colonials</b> coincided with a period of resurgent Portuguese expansionism in South and Southeast Asia, that reached its peak when Azevedo took office in 1612 but was already a spent force when he terminated his mandate as viceroy in 1617.|$|R
