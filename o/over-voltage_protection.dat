40|$|A modular coaxial {{solid-state}} closing switch {{has been}} developed for the physical replacement of a NL 488 A high-density graphite anode, water-cooled ignition in the horizontal sweeper generator of the beam dump system of the CERN SPS accelerator. The main reasons for the development in this application were environmental, low maintenance and exclusion of erratic firings. Two prototype switches have been made for a hold-off voltage of 12 kV. They consist each of a stack of four asymmetrical Fast High Current Thyristors together with capacitive <b>over-voltage</b> <b>protections</b> and resistive dividers. A specially designed trigger transformer allows the reuse of the original ignitron trigger unit without modification. The switches conduct a 46 µs half sine wave peak current of 25 kA at an initial rate of 2 kA/µs. Their losses are about 80 Joules per discharge at 12 kV. The minimum repetition rate is 5 seconds. The two switches have successfully operated for one year and the series is now under installation. A similar switch has been designed for the LHC beam extraction system to prevent erratic firings. It consists of 10 series connected asymmetrical FHCT’s and its total stray inductance is less than 150 nH. It has a hold-off voltage of 30 kV and switches a peak current of 20 kA in less than 2. 7 µs.

40|$|Current source {{inverters}} (CSIs) feature additional attention, {{compared to}} voltage source inverters (VSIs), {{because of their}} advantages, like inherent current short-circuit proof and low output voltage THD. The major constrain for CSIs is the necessity of the DC-link current continuity. Transient over-voltage occurs in case of DC-link current interruption due to failure of IGBT/series diode/gate driver. The non-robust behaviour of IGBT at breakdown voltage makes fast <b>over-voltage</b> <b>protection</b> a must. Utilization of Varistors for CSI <b>over-voltage</b> <b>protection</b> is limited because of their flat v-i characteristics. Although active clamping techniques achieve steeper characteristics, several disadvantages are remarked like the need to install a protection circuit per each IGBT and the inability to proper operation if the IGBT is defective. Breakover diodes are also good candidate but their poor dynamic behaviour limits their application to slow rate Thyristor-based CSIs. In this paper, a simplified two-stage fast-acting passive <b>over-voltage</b> <b>protection</b> network is proposed for IGBT based CSIs.

One of these harmful occurrences is something like lightning which introduces a potentially harmful voltage in the system. To {{reduce the risk of}} damage significantly an <b>over-voltage</b> <b>protection</b> device is needed. Devices which deal with this problem are common in any electrical equipment and this report deals with the construction and evaluation of one such unit. The device or equipment needing protection in this case is an industrial underwater robot built by Ocean Robotics.
