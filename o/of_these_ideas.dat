5|$|At {{the core}} of Confucian ethics were the {{selected}} virtues of filial piety, harmonious relationships, ritual, and righteousness. The amalgamation <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>ideas</b> into a theological system involving earlier cosmological theories of yin and yang {{as well as the}} five phases (i.e. natural cycles which governed Heaven, Earth, and Man) was first pioneered by the official Dong Zhongshu (179104 BCE). Although full authenticity of Dong's authorship of the Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals comes into question with hints that parts were rewritten around the time of Liu Xiang (798 BCE) or Liu Xin (d. 23 CE), three of his original memorials sent to the throne discussing his syncretic version of Confucianism were preserved in the 1st-century-CE Book of Han.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano studied {{near the}} {{intellectual}} elite of Spain, {{and by that}} time there were heated discussions about the ongoing French Revolution. The principles of equality and freedom, the universal scope of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and criticism of the divine right of kings were constant topics of debate. Among the supporters <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>ideas</b> it was thought that Spain should be remade under similar principles, and critics of such thought were rejected as tyrants or proponents of outdated ideas. However, the Spanish Enlightenment was slightly different from the French one as it still respected religion and the monarchy. Thus, despite the new influences, Belgrano remained a strong Catholic and monarchist.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi based Satyagraha on the Vedantic {{ideal of}} self-realization, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, and {{universal}} love. William Borman {{states that the}} key to his satyagraha is rooted in the Hindu Upanishadic texts. According to Indira Carr, Gandhi's ideas on ahimsa and satyagraha were founded on the philosophical foundations of Advaita Vedanta. I. Bruce Watson states that some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>ideas</b> are found not only in traditions within Hinduism, but also in Jainism or Buddhism, particularly those about non-violence, vegetarianism and universal love, but Gandhi's synthesis was to politicise these ideas.

5|$|The first Penrose tiling (tiling P1 below) is an {{aperiodic}} set of six prototiles, {{introduced by}} Roger Penrose in a 1974 paper, {{but it is}} based on pentagons rather than squares. Any attempt to tile the plane with regular pentagons necessarily leaves gaps, but Johannes Kepler showed, in his 1619 work Harmonices Mundi, that these gaps can be filled using pentagrams (star polygons), decagons and related shapes. Traces <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>ideas</b> can also be found in the work of Albrecht Dürer. Acknowledging inspiration from Kepler, Penrose found matching rules (which can be imposed by decorations of the edges) for these shapes, obtaining an aperiodic set. His tiling {{can be viewed as a}} completion of Kepler's finite Aa pattern.|$|E
5|$|The {{radicals}} refused, however, {{to recognize}} {{themselves in the}} novel's pages (Dimitri Pisarev ridiculed the notion that Raskolnikov's ideas could be identified {{with those of the}} radicals of his time), since Dostoyevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences. The aim <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>ideas</b> was altruistic and humanitarian, but these aims were to be achieved by relying on reason and suppressing entirely the spontaneous outflow of Christian pity and compassion. Chernyshevsky's utilitarian ethic proposed that thought and will in Man were subject to the laws of physical science.* Hudspith (2003), 95 Dostoyevsky believed that such ideas limited man to a product of physics, chemistry and biology, negating spontaneous emotional responses. In its latest variety of Bazarovism, Russian nihilism encouraged the creation of an élite of superior individuals to whom the hopes of the future were to be entrusted.|$|E

5|$|During {{the sixteenth}} century, Scotland {{underwent}} a Protestant Reformation {{that created a}} predominately Calvinist national kirk, which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook; the Reformation severely reduced the powers of bishops, but did not abolish them. In the earlier part of the century, the teachings of first Martin Luther and then John Calvin began to influence Scotland, particularly through Scottish scholars who had visited continental and English universities and who had often trained in the Catholic priesthood. The influence of the English was also more direct, as they supplied books and distributed Bibles and Protestant literature in the Lowlands when they invaded in 1547. Particularly important {{was the work of}} the Lutheran Scot Patrick Hamilton. His execution with other Protestant preachers in 1528, and of the Zwingli-influenced George Wishart in 1546, who was burnt at the stake in St. Andrews on the orders of Cardinal Beaton, did nothing to stem the growth <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>ideas.</b> Wishart's supporters, who included a number of Fife lairds, assassinated Beaton soon after and seized St. Andrews Castle, which they held for a year before they were defeated with the help of French forces. The survivors, including chaplain John Knox, were condemned to be galley slaves, helping to create resentment of the French and martyrs for the Protestant cause.|$|E
5|$|The poem also {{contains}} many of Southey's {{views on the}} Catholic Church and how it influenced his political views. Part of this comes from Southey's trip to Lisbon and Madrid in 1795 where he was exposed to what he believed as Catholic superstition. He believed that {{the church and the}} Catholic leaders kept the people ignorant, and he believed that the Muslims that were cast out of Spain were more tolerant. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>ideas</b> are repeated in a speech within the work by Henry V, and the character attributes ignorance and vice to oppression. Southey believed {{that the only way to}} escape from these problems was for people to believe they were part of one universal family. His enemies later described Southey's as holding Jacobin belief and claimed he supported the extremism of Robbespierre, when his sympathies laid to a larger extent with the Girondins that were replaced by the Jacobins. However, the poem is still subversive since it described a French patriot fighting against the English that parallels the strife during Southey's time.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{anthropology}} in the forensic investigation of remains {{grew out of}} the recognition {{of anthropology}} as a distinct scientific discipline and the growth of physical anthropology. The field of anthropology began in the United States and struggled to obtain recognition as a legitimate science {{during the early years of}} the twentieth century. Earnest Hooton pioneered the field of physical anthropology and became the first physical anthropologist to hold a full-time teaching position in the United States. He was an organizing committee member of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists along with its founder Aleš Hrdlička. Hooton's students created some of the first doctoral programs in physical anthropology during the early 20th century. In addition to physical anthropology, Hooton was a proponent of criminal anthropology. Now considered a pseudoscience, criminal anthropologists believed that phrenology and physiognomy could link a person's behavior to specific physical characteristics. The use of criminal anthropology to try to explain certain criminal behaviors arose out of the eugenics movement, popular at the time. It is because <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>ideas</b> that skeletal differences were measured in earnest eventually leading to the development of anthropometry and the Bertillon method of skeletal measurement by Alphonse Bertillon. The study of this information helped shape anthropologists' understanding of the human skeleton and the multiple skeletal differences that can occur.|$|E
