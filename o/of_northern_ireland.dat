5|$|The deaths led {{to public}} {{mourning}} and {{protests against the}} Provisional IRA. Pressure to act precipitated a political crisis for the government <b>of</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland,</b> {{which led to the}} resignation <b>of</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> Prime Minister James Chichester-Clark. The British Army raised the minimum age needed to serve in Northern Ireland to 18 in response to this incident. In 2010 a memorial was dedicated to the three soldiers near to where they were killed in north Belfast.|$|E

5|$|The benevolence of the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury also {{extended}} to the ownership and use of Lough Neagh, {{which is the largest}} freshwater lake in the British Isles and ranks among the 40 largest lakes of Europe. Five of the six counties <b>of</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> have shores on the lough (only County Fermanagh does not), and its area is split among them. The lake is the source of 40percent of Northern Ireland's drinking water. While this ownership could feasibly increase the financial outlook of the family estate, at Shaftesbury's insistence, water continues to be extracted from the lough at no charge to either the citizens or civic government <b>of</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland.</b>|$|E

5|$|Several other Privy Councils {{have advised}} the sovereign. England and Scotland once had {{separate}} Privy Councils (the Privy Council of England and Privy Council of Scotland). The Acts of Union 1707 united {{the two countries}} into the Kingdom of Great Britain and in 1708 the Parliament of Great Britain abolished the Privy Council of Scotland. Thereafter there was one Privy Council of Great Britain sitting in London. Ireland, on the other hand, continued to have a separate Privy Council even after the Act of Union 1800. The Privy Council of Ireland was abolished in 1922, when {{the southern part of}} Ireland separated from the United Kingdom; it was succeeded by the Privy Council <b>of</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland,</b> which became dormant after the suspension of the Parliament <b>of</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> in 1972. No further appointments have been made since then, and only four appointees were still living as of May 2014.|$|E

5|$|The final {{was highly}} anticipated, {{particularly}} as Armagh and Tyrone are neighbouring counties. Police Service <b>of</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> Deputy Chief Constable Paul Leighton estimated that 40,000 fans would travel from Northern Ireland to Dublin, despite each competing county only being allocated approximately 10,000 match tickets. Declan Martin, policy director for Dublin Chamber of Commerce, expected the revenue {{generated in the}} city {{as a result of the}} final to double because two sides from Ulster were involved.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{permanent}} garrisons in Northern Ireland throughout its history, the British Army was deployed as a peacekeeping force from 1969 to 2007 in Operation Banner. Initially, this was (in the wake of unionist attacks on nationalist communities in Derry and Belfast) to prevent further loyalist attacks on Catholic communities; it developed into support of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and its successor, the Police Service <b>of</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> (PSNI) against the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA). Under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, there was a gradual {{reduction in the number}} of soldiers deployed. In 2005, after the PIRA declared a ceasefire, the British Army dismantled posts, withdrew many troops and restored troop levels to those of a peace-time garrison.|$|E
5|$|In {{the three}} decades {{following}} 1969, {{the army was}} heavily deployed in Northern Ireland's Operation Banner to support the Royal Ulster Constabulary (later the Police Service <b>of</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland)</b> in their conflict with republican paramilitary groups. The locally recruited Ulster Defence Regiment was formed, becoming home-service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment in 1992 before it was disbanded in 2006. Over 700 soldiers were killed during the Troubles. Following the 1994–1996 IRA ceasefires and since 1997, demilitarisation {{has been part of}} the peace process and the military presence has been reduced. On 25 June 2007 the 2nd Battalion of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment left the army complex in Bessbrook, County Armagh, ending the longest operation in British Army history.|$|E
5|$|No formal {{coursing}} {{has taken}} place in Northern Ireland since 2002, as Ministers have refused the coursing clubs permission to net hares, and have protected them from being coursed or hunted under the Game Preservation (Northern Ireland) Act and in June 2010 the Northern Ireland Assembly voted to ban the practice. The two extant Northern Ireland coursing clubs since 2002 have travelled to the Republic to hold meetings jointly with coursing clubs there. Opinion polls commissioned by the League Against Cruel Sports as part of its campaigning have shown very strong public opposition to hare coursing from both urban and rural residents <b>of</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> (and the Republic of Ireland).|$|E

5|$|On 16 September it was {{revealed}} that the party would seek to have Martin McGuinness, deputy First Minister <b>of</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland,</b> nominated to contest the election. With 14 TDs and three Senators, Sinn Féin were three short of the required twenty Oireachtas members to nominate a candidate for the presidency. Soon after the nomination was announced, four Independent TDs agreed to nominate McGuinness, securing his nomination: Michael Healy-Rae and Tom Fleming (both representing Kerry South), Luke 'Ming' Flanagan (Roscommon–South Leitrim) and Finian McGrath (Dublin North-Central). Both 'Ming' Flanagan and McGrath had previously pledged their support to Norris.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 1981, Thatcher and Irish Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald had {{established}} the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Council, {{a forum for}} meetings between the two governments. On 15 November 1985, Thatcher and FitzGerald signed the Hillsborough Anglo-Irish Agreement, which {{marked the first time}} a British government had given the Republic of Ireland an advisory role in the governance <b>of</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland.</b> In protest, the Ulster Says No movement led by Ian Paisley attracted 100,000 to a rally in Belfast, Ian Gow, later assassinated by the PIRA, resigned as Minister of State in the HM Treasury, and all 15 Unionist MPs resigned their parliamentary seats; only one was not returned in the subsequent by-elections on 23 January 1986.|$|E
5|$|Political {{turmoil in}} Ireland {{continued}} as the Nationalists fought for independence; George expressed his horror at government-sanctioned killings and reprisals to Prime Minister David Lloyd George. At the opening {{session of the}} Parliament <b>of</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> on 22 June 1921, the King appealed for conciliation in a speech part drafted by General Jan Smuts and approved by Lloyd George. A few weeks later, a truce was agreed. Negotiations between Britain and the Irish secessionists led to {{the signing of the}} Anglo-Irish Treaty. By the end of 1922, Ireland was partitioned, the Irish Free State was established, and Lloyd George was out of office.|$|E
