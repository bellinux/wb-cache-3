25|$|Riepe {{states that}} the Ajivikas belief in predeterminism {{does not mean that}} they were pessimistic.

Actions had immediate effects in one's current life but without any moral traces, and both the action and the effect was predetermined, according to the Ajivikas.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is {{characterized}} by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>one</b> causes: if one causes suffering, then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering; if one causes happiness, then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness.|$|E

Abramović's art also represents the objectification of the female body, as she remains motionless and allows the spectators to do as they please with her body, pushing the limits <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>one</b> would consider acceptable. This type of representation also reflects key political issues such as BDSM, which complicates and questions the relation between art versus sexuality and public discourse.|$|E
25|$|As {{barbecues}} {{continued to}} be held through the times of U.S. expansion the traditions began to migrate with the people.

Competitive barbecue competitions are held throughout the country in which people will compete by cooking barbecue and having it judged by the events judges. The constraints <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>one</b> may barbecue and the qualities that are judged vary by competition.

25|$|Hauerwas {{believes}} {{that there is a}} difference between the concept of death and the criteria for death. The concept of death “involves a philosophical judgment of a significant change that has happened in a person” and therefore “is a correlative <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>one</b> takes to be the necessary condition of human life, e.g., … the potential for consciousness”. The criteria of death, however, are “those empirical measurements that can be made to determine whether a person is dead, such as cessation of respiration or a flat EEG”. Thus, brain death is a criterion of death that may serve “as a symbol of when it is time to die”. A person must not delay death so long that it is no longer possible to die a good death.|$|E

500|$|In {{an essay}} in 1999, he {{identified}} {{what he saw as}} the harmful role played by sentimentality in a case involving Stephen Lawrence. Lawrence, a young black British man, was murdered and the subsequent case was mired in accusations of racism among the investigating police. Dalrymple wrote that [...] "the response to the Stephen Lawrence case is another example of how the rule of law is to be supplanted by the rule of sentiment—and it is yet one more instance <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>one</b> might call the Dianafication of British public life, in which transitory popular enthusiasm trumps venerable tradition". In a 2004 essay, he analysed how sentimentality towards children was closely linked with violence and neglect, particularly in the poorest sections of British society: [...] "The upbringing of children in much of Britain is a witches' brew of sentimentality, brutality, and neglect, in which overindulgence in the latest fashions, toys, or clothes, and a television in the bedroom are regarded as the highest—indeed only—manifestations of tender concern for a child's welfare".|$|E

Once at the designated location, the ships were put into position and scuttled over the next days, under heavy German artillery fire. Naval Armed Guardsmen manned the guns on all the gooseberry ships to protect against frequent German air attacks; West Nohnos gunners assisted in shooting down several planes on 10 June. All the while, harbor pilots—about half of the New York Bar Pilots Association, according to one source—carefully positioned the ships. West Nohno and [...] were the last two ships sunk off Utah Beach when they went down on 11 June. Even though she had been sunk, West Nohno continued to serve as an antiaircraft platform manned by Navy gun crews until 18 June, and by Army crews after that date. West Nohnos naval gunners were awarded a battle star for participation in the Normandy Landings.|$|E
500|$|Throughout September, Agnew {{was in the}} news, {{generally}} as {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>one</b> reporter called his [...] "offensive and sometimes dangerous banality". He used the derogatory term [...] "Polack" [...] to describe Polish-Americans, referred to a Japanese-American reporter as [...] "the fat Jap", and appeared to dismiss poor socio-economic conditions by stating [...] "if you've seen one slum you've seen them all." [...] He attacked Humphrey as soft on communism, an appeaser like Britain's prewar prime minister Neville Chamberlain. Agnew was mocked by his Democratic opponents; a Humphrey commercial displayed the message [...] "Spiro Agnew for Vice President" [...] against a soundtrack of prolonged hysterical laughter, before a final message: [...] "This would be funny if it weren't so serious." [...] Agnew's comments outraged many, but Nixon did not rein him in; such right-wing populism had a strong appeal in the Southern states and was an effective counter to Wallace. Agnew's rhetoric was also popular in some Northern areas, and helped to galvanize [...] "white backlash" [...] into something less racially defined, more attuned to the suburban ethic defined by historian Peter B. Levy as [...] "orderliness, personal responsibility, the sanctity of hard work, the nuclear family, and law and order".|$|E
